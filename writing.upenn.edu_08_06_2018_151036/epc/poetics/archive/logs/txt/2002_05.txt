But its not an "either a book or the net" its both and either; obviously
something on the epc can direct one to a book and vica versa: books will be
around for a long time. Who lies in bed reading a comp: I cant because I get
tired at my age and I like books in bed ?... But then the computer (and the
net) has also opened up new worlds...of course Sod's Law kicks in...with
every tech advance its been shown that at some point some person somewhere
will have to say to machine or device (no matter how faithful or "dogged"
that device has been in previous service) the immortal British expression:
"Sod it!"  (said with a strong London accent I think and with great
near-expletive emphasis)...This is accompanied by the person, or the Oxonian
scientist in queston, or a housewife,  kicking or even killing the machine
in question with great and relish and vehemence. This is the age ( the New
Ludditic Age) of the beginning of  the Age of Machine Murders! That aside,
those  who can accept life's viccsssitudes and wearinesses, will find
comfort in comps and pleasure in books. Richard.

Is it still "flaming" if the person you're flaming is a pseudonym? My =
response was an emotional one--okay, that's not allowed here, and I've =
been officially reprimanded b/c accordingly. I just wanted to go on =
record as being pissed off at the way these people who hate America and =
Israel use the list as an opportunity to jump up and down on the graves =
of those who are being murdered by their ilk.=20
So, Mark, when you jumped up in defense of these, um, types of people, =
and said that my post should not have been allowed, I had to wonder why =
my personal feelings were so intimidating to you that you wanted them =
banned. Your characterization of me as having "no respect for anyone =
else on the list" was (besides being a leap right over the specific =
content of my message) not only a personal insult but an attempt to pit =
"anyone else on the list" against me. It doesn't get much more cowardly =
than that. I hope I've answered your question. But I bet you didn't get =
a warning notice from the list moderator for "gratuitously attacking" =
me, did you?
As for presenting a "counter-argument" to the hate messages of Dick =
Tyler and "Mister Hazim Ali": it is too large and nasty a pile of shit =
to shovel--it doesn't really qualify as "ideas," and only paranoid =
pseudo-intellectuals and people without a free press believe their crap =
anyway.

Jeffrey, I do appreciate your theory; and I can even
see some evidence of what you're saying . . . What is
"pure zero drive," as you use the phrase here?" I
don't get it. And is replication + variation, which is
what the poem explores, at least in part, always this
"pure zero drive?" . . . in terms of theory-death
(which is otherwise interesting and useful)
.......................................................
FROM PAUL MANN'S ~MASOCRITICISM~:


In some of Freud's later works, the impossible notion
of the death drive occupied a special place. Far from
immortality or the endless satisfaction of pleasures
(or rather, at their deepest level), Freud came to
believe that the organism desired most of all to die,
"in its own way." The death drive is a primordial
force, indeed the only "primordial force," deeper than
life, life's "final purpose."

Repetition compulsions, which we have already
encountered, are the simplest expressions of this
absurd drive. For Freud, according to Jean Laplanche,
"the most varied manifestations of repetition . . .
are attributed to the essence of drives" (Laplanche
1985, 107). The psychic economy is driven by a desire
to preclude change through repetition, that is to
say, through a principle of constancy. But this
principle of constancy is itself the expression of a
deeper principle: a zero principle. For Freud there is
an absolute "primacy of zero in relation to constancy"
(108). The constancy that the organism seeks must
finally be identified as death.

Furthermore, this zero principle is ineluctably
connected to aggression. Sadean aggression toward the
other is in fact a displacement of a more fundamental
autoaggression. According to Laplanche,

    'a part of the primal destructiveness is deflected
toward the external world, giving rise to the
manifestation we identify as aggressiveness. Thus . .
. what is affirmed here is the primacy of
self-aggression over heteroaggression, that
self-aggression being, in turn, only the consequence
of the absolute primacy within the individual of the
tendency toward zero, conceived as the most radical
form of the pleasure principle.'

Russian equivalent of the Stealth bombers, they have ICBMs, huge underground
cities, shoot crims in the back of  the head, eat babies alive, and they

Aha, gentle list reader-- you thought the subject line referred to the U.S.
Ironically enough, it refers to Iraq.  Here is an interesting article from
the Observer.

Inside a vile republic

No one should be in any doubt about Saddam's depraved intentions

Henry McDonald
Sunday April 28, 2002
The Observer

Children aged between five and 10 are tortured and beaten. Their screams and
cries are recorded on video. The horrific images are then shown to other
men.

But this is no sick, paedophile, child-abusing fantasy captured on camera.
According to one man who was forced to watch these vile scenes, the terror
inflicted on these tiny victims was motivated principally for cold-hearted
political reasons. Because whatever revolting pleasure was obtained by the
torturers and the filmcrew alike, the main purpose of this recorded sadism
was to brutalise, terrorise and wear down potential enemies and traitors.

This repulsive testimony of child torture as psychological warfare comes via
a defector from the sinister Iraqi Mukhabarat or intelligence service and
demonstrates the depravity of a regime objectively defended by Irish and
other Western peaceniks.

The defector's claims appear in the current edition of Vanity Fair, compiled
by David Rose. Never before has an article provoked such a feeling of
disgust. For Rose's account of the extent to which Saddam Hussein's
dictatorship will go to terrify its own servants and agents makes the flesh
crawl. More disturbing still is the defector's allegations about the lengths
the Ba'athist élite have gone in order to acquire weapons of mass
destruction.

For example, the former Iraqi agent claims he travelled to Africa to buy
highly toxic 'radioactive material with which to build a dirty radiological
bomb' that kills thousands slowly through radioactive pollution and cancers.

He also outlines how Saddam's tyranny trains and finances Hamas, the
Palestinian Islamic fundamentalist movement. According to the defector, it
was Iraq which taught Hamas how to make bombs. Moreover, he says that Iraq
has developed a new missile system to hit Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and
Iran as well, of course, as Israel.

Rose's courageous and thoroughly researched report will make uncomfortable
reading for those on the Western Left most vociferously opposed to any
United States-led attack on Iraq. Because if the defector is telling the
truth (his evidence is supported by Charles Duelfer, the former deputy head
of UNSCOM, the mission aimed at overseeing the destruction of Saddam's
weapons of mass destruction), then there are serious challenges for the West
and hard questions for Western peace groups.

For Western governments, especially those EU nations, including Ireland,
which still adopt an ostrich-like approach to Iraq's nuclear ambitions, the
dilemma will not disappear - how to stop Saddam getting the bomb.

Every pacific avenue has been tried since the second Gulf War, from
diplomacy to sanctions, and yet the Baghdad dictatorship, according to
former agents such as the one who spoke to Rose, continues to search for the
technology and raw material needed to build nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons.

The defector outlines how the regime evades sanctions through a series of
front companies in the Middle East and Europe to import material into Iraq
that forms the basis of 'dirty bio-bombs' that can kill tens of thousands.
His evidence suggests that even targeted smart sanctions may not prevent the
acquisition of these weapons. The United States and the EU are then left
with only one other option - military intervention.

Some policy-makers express concern that an outright military assault on
Saddam and the Ba'ath will set the entire Middle East ablaze. They argue
that in an atmosphere of seething Arab anger over the Israeli incursions
into Palestinian territory, invading Iraq would push the region over the
edge into widespread, possibly global, conflict.

This thesis, however, entirely misses the point of Saddam's project to build
a nuclear, chemical and/or bio-bomb. Iraq's acquisition of weapons of mass
destruction is designed precisely to escalate the Arab-Israeli conflict into
a nuclear confrontation. Young Arabs such as the polite Palestinian student
I met last Thursday evening in Queen's University Belfast look forward to
the day of the Arab bomb. And their goal, according to him, regardless of
the rhetoric about two-state solutions from the PLO's apologists in the
West, is the complete destruction of the state of Israel, if necessary
through the use of, or threatened use of, chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons.

The trouble with Western peace groups and their leftist support base is that
they have held a starry-eyed or, in the case of the Irish Left, a
Starry-Plough-eyed view of the Third World, especially those states that
style themselves 'anti-imperialist'. What they surely cannot ignore any
longer is the existence of a regime that endangers the stability not only of
the Middle East but perhaps the planet itself and which will torture and
murder even its own children in order to shore up Saddam's Republic of Fear.

i had to respond to this query because i just taught from this book a couple
weeks ago and it's very interesting--it might not fit your criteria (it only
goes to 1970--in fact, it was orig. pub'd 1971--and it's mainly political) but
it includes stuff from the Diggers, the Situationists, the English
Situationists, and lots of other stuff:

        A great manifesto is the avant pop manifesto by Mark Amerika
(see below) it is also located on the web at
http://www.altx.com/manifestos/avant.pop.manifesto.html=20





AVANT-POP MANIFESTO:
THREAD BARING ITSELF IN TEN QUICK POSTS

By Mark Amerika

Now that Postmodernism is dead and we're in the process of finally
burying it, something else is starting to take hold in the cultural
imagination and I propose that we call this new phenomenon Avant-Pop.=20

Whereas it's true that certain strains of Postmodernism, Modernism,
Structuralism and Post-Structuralism, Surrealism, Dadaism, Futurism,
Capitalism and even Marxism pervade the new sensibility, the major
difference is that the artists who create Avant-Pop art are the Children
of Mass Media (even more than being the children of their parents who
have much less influence over them). Most of the early practitioners of
Postmodernism, who came into active adult consciousness in the fifties,
sixties and early seventies, tried desperately to keep themselves away
from the forefront of the newly powerful Mediagenic Reality that was
rapidly becoming the place where most of our social exchange was taking
place. Despite its early insistence on remaining caught up in the
academic and elitist art world's presuppositions of self-
institutionalization and incestuality, Postmodernism found itself
overtaken by the popular media engine that eventually killed it and from
its remains Avant-Pop is now born.=20

Avant-Pop artists have had to resist the avant-garde sensibility that
stubbornly denies the existence of a popular media culture and its
dominant influence over the way we use our imaginations to process
experience. At the same time, A-P artists have had to work hard at not
becoming so enamored of the false consciousness of the Mass Media itself
that they lose sight of their creative directives. The single most
important creative directive of the new wave of Avant-Pop artists is to
enter the mainstream culture as a parasite would sucking out all the bad
blood that lies between the mainstream and the margin. By sucking on the
contaminated bosom of mainstream culture, Avant-Pop artists are turning
into Mutant Fictioneers, it's true, but our goal is and always has been
to face up to our monster deformation and to find wild and adventurous
ways to love it for what it is. The latter strains of Postmodernism
attempted to do this too but were unable to find the secret key that led
right into the mainstream cell so as to facilitate and accelerate the
rapid decomposition of the host's body. This is all changing as the
emerging youth culture, with its deep-rooted cynicism and nomadic
movement within the "dance of biz", now has the power to make or break
the economic future of decrepit late-capitalism.=20
Avant-Pop artists themselves have acquired immunity from the Terminal
Death dysfunctionalism of a Pop Culture gone awry and are now ready to
offer their own weirdly concocted elixirs to cure us from this dreadful
disease ("information sickness") that infects the core of our collective
life.=20


Now whereas Avant-Pop artists are fully aware of their need to maintain
a crucial Avant-sensibility as it drives the creative processing of
their work and attaches itself to the avant-garde lineage they spring
from, they are also quick to acknowledge the need to develop more
openminded strategies that will allow them to attract attention within
the popularized forms of representation that fill up the contemporary
Mediascape. Our collective mission is to radically alter the Pop
Culture's focus by channeling a more popularized kind of dark, sexy,
surreal, and subtly ironic gesturing that grows out of the work of many
20th century artists like Marcel Duchamp, John Cage, Lenny Bruce,
Raymond Federman, William Burroughs, William Gibson, Ronald Sukenick,
Kathy Acker, the two Davids (Cronenberg and Lynch), art movements like
Fluxus, Situationism, Lettrism and Neo-Hoodooism, and scores of rock
bands including the Sex Pistols, Pere Ubu, Bongwater, Tackhead, The
Breeders, Pussy Galore, Frank Zappa, Sonic Youth, Ministry, Jane's
Addiction, Tuxedo Moon and The Residents.=20
The emerging wave of Avant-Pop artists now arriving on the scene find
themselves caught in this struggle to rapidly transform our sick,
commodity-infested workaday culture into a more sensual, trippy, exotic
and networked Avant-Pop experience. One way to achieve this would be by
creating and expanding niche communities. Niche communities, many of
which already exist through the zine scene, will become, by virtue of
the convergent electronic environments, virtual communities. By actively
engaging themselves in the continuous exchange and proliferation of
collectively-generated electronic publications, individually- designed
creative works, manifestos, live on-line readings, multi- media
interactive hypertexts, conferences, etc., Avant-Pop artists and the
alternative networks they are part of will eat away at the conventional
relics of a bygone era where the individual artist- author creates their
beautifully-crafted, original works of art to be consumed primarily by
the elitist art-world and their business- cronies who pass judgement on
what is appropriate and what is not.=20

Literary establishment? Art establishment? Forget it. Avant-Pop artists
wear each other's experiential data like waves of chaotic energy
colliding and mixing in the textual-blood while the ever-changing flow
of creative projects that ripple from their collective work floods the
electronic cult-terrain with a subtle anti-establishment energy that
will forever change the way we disseminate and interact with writing.=20


Avant-Pop artists welcome the new Electronic Age with open arms because
we know that this will vastly increase our chances of finding an
audience of like-minded individuals who we can communicate and

the enemy of the theater. I have always been. As much as I love the
theater, I am, for this very reason, equally it's enemy." Avant-Pop
artists are the enemy of pop culture and the avant-garde, both domains
seemingly so far-fetched in a world that celebrates itself with live TV
wars, rampant economic disenfranchisement and nanosecond identity
changes. Our lineage, the bloodbath of cultural history we swim in,
includes Artaud, Lautreamont, Jarry, Rimbaud, Futurism, Situationism,
Fluxus, Abstract Expressionism, Henry Miller, Gertrude Stein, William
Burroughs, Terry Southern, Surfiction, Metafiction, Postmodernism in all

Postmodernism changed the way we read texts. The main tenet of
Postmodernism was: I, whoever that is, will put together these bits of
data and form a Text while you, whoever that is, will produce your own
meaning based off what you bring to the Text. The future of Avant-Pop
writing will take this even one step further. The main tenet that will
evolve for the Avant-Pop movement is: I, whoever that is, am always
interacting with data created by the Collective You, whoever that is,
and by interacting with and supplementing the Collective You, will find
meaning.=20
In an Information Age where we all suffer from Information Sickness and
Overload, the only cure is a highly-potent, creatively-filtered tonic of
(yes) textual residue spilled from the depths of our spiritual
unconscious. Creating a work of art will depend more and more on the
ability of the artist to select, organize and present the bits of raw
data we have at our disposal. We all know originality is dead and that

Boulder, ColoradoAVANT-POP MANIFESTO:
THREAD BARING ITSELF IN TEN QUICK POSTS

By Mark Amerika

Now that Postmodernism is dead and we're in the process of finally
burying it, something else is starting to take hold in the cultural
imagination and I propose that we call this new phenomenon Avant-Pop.=20

Whereas it's true that certain strains of Postmodernism, Modernism,
Structuralism and Post-Structuralism, Surrealism, Dadaism, Futurism,
Capitalism and even Marxism pervade the new sensibility, the major
difference is that the artists who create Avant-Pop art are the Children
of Mass Media (even more than being the children of their parents who
have much less influence over them). Most of the early practitioners of
Postmodernism, who came into active adult consciousness in the fifties,
sixties and early seventies, tried desperately to keep themselves away
from the forefront of the newly powerful Mediagenic Reality that was
rapidly becoming the place where most of our social exchange was taking
place. Despite its early insistence on remaining caught up in the
academic and elitist art world's presuppositions of self-
institutionalization and incestuality, Postmodernism found itself
overtaken by the popular media engine that eventually killed it and from
its remains Avant-Pop is now born.=20

Avant-Pop artists have had to resist the avant-garde sensibility that
stubbornly denies the existence of a popular media culture and its
dominant influence over the way we use our imaginations to process
experience. At the same time, A-P artists have had to work hard at not
becoming so enamored of the false consciousness of the Mass Media itself
that they lose sight of their creative directives. The single most
important creative directive of the new wave of Avant-Pop artists is to
enter the mainstream culture as a parasite would sucking out all the bad
blood that lies between the mainstream and the margin. By sucking on the
contaminated bosom of mainstream culture, Avant-Pop artists are turning
into Mutant Fictioneers, it's true, but our goal is and always has been
to face up to our monster deformation and to find wild and adventurous
ways to love it for what it is. The latter strains of Postmodernism
attempted to do this too but were unable to find the secret key that led
right into the mainstream cell so as to facilitate and accelerate the
rapid decomposition of the host's body. This is all changing as the
emerging youth culture, with its deep-rooted cynicism and nomadic
movement within the "dance of biz", now has the power to make or break
the economic future of decrepit late-capitalism.=20
Avant-Pop artists themselves have acquired immunity from the Terminal
Death dysfunctionalism of a Pop Culture gone awry and are now ready to
offer their own weirdly concocted elixirs to cure us from this dreadful
disease ("information sickness") that infects the core of our collective
life.=20


Now whereas Avant-Pop artists are fully aware of their need to maintain
a crucial Avant-sensibility as it drives the creative processing of
their work and attaches itself to the avant-garde lineage they spring
from, they are also quick to acknowledge the need to develop more
openminded strategies that will allow them to attract attention within
the popularized forms of representation that fill up the contemporary
Mediascape. Our collective mission is to radically alter the Pop
Culture's focus by channeling a more popularized kind of dark, sexy,
surreal, and subtly ironic gesturing that grows out of the work of many
20th century artists like Marcel Duchamp, John Cage, Lenny Bruce,
Raymond Federman, William Burroughs, William Gibson, Ronald Sukenick,
Kathy Acker, the two Davids (Cronenberg and Lynch), art movements like
Fluxus, Situationism, Lettrism and Neo-Hoodooism, and scores of rock
bands including the Sex Pistols, Pere Ubu, Bongwater, Tackhead, The
Breeders, Pussy Galore, Frank Zappa, Sonic Youth, Ministry, Jane's
Addiction, Tuxedo Moon and The Residents.=20
The emerging wave of Avant-Pop artists now arriving on the scene find
themselves caught in this struggle to rapidly transform our sick,
commodity-infested workaday culture into a more sensual, trippy, exotic
and networked Avant-Pop experience. One way to achieve this would be by
creating and expanding niche communities. Niche communities, many of
which already exist through the zine scene, will become, by virtue of
the convergent electronic environments, virtual communities. By actively
engaging themselves in the continuous exchange and proliferation of
collectively-generated electronic publications, individually- designed
creative works, manifestos, live on-line readings, multi- media
interactive hypertexts, conferences, etc., Avant-Pop artists and the
alternative networks they are part of will eat away at the conventional
relics of a bygone era where the individual artist- author creates their
beautifully-crafted, original works of art to be consumed primarily by
the elitist art-world and their business- cronies who pass judgement on
what is appropriate and what is not.=20

Literary establishment? Art establishment? Forget it. Avant-Pop artists
wear each other's experiential data like waves of chaotic energy
colliding and mixing in the textual-blood while the ever-changing flow
of creative projects that ripple from their collective work floods the
electronic cult-terrain with a subtle anti-establishment energy that
will forever change the way we disseminate and interact with writing.=20


Avant-Pop artists welcome the new Electronic Age with open arms because
we know that this will vastly increase our chances of finding an
audience of like-minded individuals who we can communicate and
collaborate with. The future of writing is moving away from the lone
writer sitting behind a keyboard cranking out verse so that one day he
or she may find an editor or agent or publisher who will hype their work
to those interested in commercial literary culture. Instead, the future
of writing will feature more multi-media collaborative authoring that
will make itself available to hundreds if not thousands of potential
associates around the world who will be actively internetworking in
their own niche communities. Value will depend more on the ability of
the different groups of artist-associates to develop a reputation for
delivering easily accessible hits of the Special Information Tonic to

I did a mail art project called MOVEMENTS & MANIFESTOS in the late 80s.  I had
intended to eventually publish them hard copy but that never panned out.  But I
have a file drawer with about 100 manifestos plus supporting materials from all
over, mainly of poetic & artistic flavor, with the most interesting ones mostly
coming from pre-fallenwall eastern bloc countries.

Mister Leonard Brink

Sir, what planet are you from? Why would you assume
I'm a pseudonym?

That's a particularly puzzling form of linguistic
erasure and violence.

I'm not a pseudonym. My name is Kazim Ali. I spell out
the "mister" because I'm a punk.

And I don't hate Israel. The signature quote at the
bottom of my post is by an Israeli poet. And what does
all that have to do with anything anyway?

Oh and I'm an American. But why am I defending myself
to you?

It's about affirming life, Leonard. As my fellow
patriot Suheir Hammad wrote "You are either with life
or you are against life."

Which side are you on, Mister Brink?

I hear this sort of logic all the time from supposedly 'non-profit' arts
groups... define "break even" please. Are there salaries involved?

Perhaps the "non-profit" presses should pool their resources, cut-costs
(establish an online presence that is more than a solicitation of
submissives), and begin paying their contributors -- and seriously attempt
to threaten the fearsome status of "evil commercial" publishers. Why can't
copywriting be poetry?

It's not post-70s but Yoko Ono's "To the Wesleyan
People" (reprinted in both Grapefruit and YES) is
really amazing.

Also in the most recent issue of Fence there was a
really beautiful manifesto from the Black Took
Collective.

Does Stephen Burt's "ellipitical poets" (forget the
name) essay count as a manifesto?

Also Jorie Graham's (there's that name again!)
introduction to 1990 Best American Poetry.

I don't for the life of me know why you would want to separate "artistic"
and/or "literary" manifestos from everything else! That's like teaching life
on a contemporary farm, with a Gucci handbag as your prop. Previous attempts
at doing this to the manifesto have resulted in challenged anthologies, for
one. I'm thinking especially of Mary Ann Caws's otherwise exceptional (in
the sense that every text in there is great to have anthologized as such)
Manifest: A Century of Isms, which includes some Language Poetry
"manifestos" -- but that's pushing the word, precisely because there is a
concerted attempt to contain the idea of the manifesto to sheerly the
"aesthetic": doesn't work (consider Janet Lyon's book on subject).



Poet Robert Kroetsch, "I Wanted to Write a Manifesto," great essay / short
story.
_A Likely Story: the writing life_. Red Deer, Alberta: Red Deer Colege
Press, 1995. 41-64.
Goes to heart of problem of writing a contemporary manifesto, or if you like
is a "manifesto" for the ordinary -- concluding along the lines of David
Antin's title talk in _What It Means to Be Avant-Garde_



Isabella Rossellini has a collection of makeup called Manifesto; the
advertising claims to emphasize "practicality." Hence, this is your problem
with the manifesto post 1970.
        But I think it opens up a whole new use for theoretical language in poetry
and in everyday genres, e.g. "deconstructing a police van," as a journalist
covering the recent protests in Montreal writes (or to that effect) in one
of Aaron Vidaver's links in his recent post. You can trace this use of high
theory for manifesting ends of everyday life in a lot of contemporary
poetry -- poetry which doesn't, at the same time, actually the word
manifesto. It's as if the genre's hortatoriness and martial language has
been melted into the poetry -- along with high theory. Off the top of my
head: Lisa Robertson, Jeff Derksen, Rodrigo Toscano...



In a different tone and register, Ron Silliman, Manifest (Canary Islands:
Zasterle, 1990) can be read as dealing with the performative problem of
manifesting, as in disclosing, revealing, especially if you dip back to
Imagism for modernist con-trast/-text.



In a different tone and register, The Nude Formalism by Charles Bernstein --
you can use that along with modernist stuff as well, but in relation to the
New Formalist tracts (I guess they're manifesto-ish) from the 80s (Goiai sp?
etc).



"OK Soda Manifesto" (1994, I think):
"1) What's the point of OK? Well, what's the point of anything?
2) OK Soda emphatically rejects anything that is not OK, and fully supports
anything that is.
3) The better you understand something, the more OK it turns out to be.
4) OK Soda says, "Don't be fooled into thinking there has to be a reason for
everything."
5) OK Soda reveals the surprising truth about people and situations.
6) OK Soda does not subscribe to any religion, or endorse any political
party, or do anything other than feel OK.
7) There is no real secret to feeling OK.
8) OK Soda may be the preferred drink of other people such as yourself.
9) Never overestimate the remarkable abilities of "OK" brand soda.
10) Please wake up every morning knowing that things are going to be OK."

OK Soda was an invention of the Global Teenage Program of Coca Cola, and
included a True or False "OK Soda Personality Inventory":
"1. Pets are fun.
2. I sure like bicycles.
3. Generally speaking, tables should have at least four legs.
4. When I see a gerbil on a treadmill, I'm reminded of me.
5. Gloomy -- it's just one of the ways weather can be.
6. A tingling sensation in your elbows, feet or other body parts should not
be mistaken for a feeling of OKness.
7. Newspapers are black and white and red all over.
8. Cinder blocks are no subsitute for a foundation of happiness.
9. Walls should be just tall enough to support the ceiling.
10. There is a mystery element to feeling OK.
11. It's better to be nice than mean, but mean can sure come in handy."

Leonard,

I think what is most clear is that you have exhibited an astonishing
defensiveness.  Neither Richard nor Kazim mention Israel, but you do.
More to the point, it only takes two anti-american responses to provoke
you into ad hominem (and not very graceful ad hominem) attack (not a
counter-argument).  I don't know--it seems pretty pathetic to me. And
"Hazim" is currently teaching in NYC at the Asian American Writing
Workshop.  "Niiice," as they used to say.


There are plenty of places to get your fill of patriotism. It's great that
Poetics is not one of them.

Robert

ps: on the side of life, in favor of Richard's fervor (if not all his
ideas), and pro-Palestinian, in case you can't infer this.

1, Susie Brights "Roll your own Erotic Manifesto"

2. Valerie Solanas's "SCUM manifesto"

3. Annie Sprinkle's "Guidelines for sex in the 90's" ( a sort of manifesto)

4. Donna Haraway's "Cyborg Manifesto"

5. Sojourner Truth's "Ain't I a Woman?"
6. Mina Loy's "feminist Manifesto"




manifestos do not always come nicely packaged, but rather hidden in other
text as text-points for a community to gather  around as a manifesto or they
work to manifest community, As the queer culture (especially act-up) did in
the seventies with Foucault's "History of Sexuality". also examples could
be, "Yellow wallpaper" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, "THe Well of Loneliness"
by Radclyffe Hall,  Kate Bornsteins, "Gender Outlaw."

1. Establishing a Demilitarized Zone: Tactics of resistance", by C. Jacob
Hale in Consuming the living dis(re)membering the dead in the butch/ftm
boarderlands.

2. Monique Wittig "The point of view: universal or particular"

3. Adreinne Rich "Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Experience"


Others not include could be the writings and deconstruction of gender by
Julian of Norwish,o r other works by Mary Wollstonecraft , Lady Mary
Chudleigh, Anne Finch, Anna Letittia Barbaurd, Vignia Woolf.

Acting on the premise that one person's crap is another's ideology, why is it
that so frequently when one criticizes the murderous and fatal aspects of
American foreign policy, the knee-jerk response from the 'America, my country
right or wrong' crowd is to accuse said critic of anti-Americanism?  And why,
when one presents a few critical facts showing the brutal consequences of
these aspects, as I did in my last post, are these facts ignored in favor of
even more anti-anti-Americanism fervor?  For myself, I would like to see
these facts, either for or against, contested with other facts, either for or
against.  Even distortions are better than out and out name-calling, since
distortions can be argued and corrected.  For those of us whose heads are so
twisted by emotions, this is a plea for reasoned argument.

I should like to make one thing clear:  I'm not in favor of censorship, or
'moderation' as it's referred to on this list.  Nor am I in favor of b/c
admonitions.  I operate on the principle that I say what I say, and others
say what they say, and trust to the intelligent folks on this list to make up
their individual minds.  If windhover@SPRINTMAIL.COM or
richard.tylr@XTRA.CO.NZ want to spit through their teeth when they write, let
them.  I know this is not the prevailing attitude on this list, but I thought
I'd just add my little pinch of salt.

MANIFIESTO DE LA PALABRA
POR ANTONIO TABUCCHI

[Antonio Tabucchi es escritor italiano].

Traducción de Carlos Gumpert

1. Existen varias formas de dictadura. En Italia estamos ante una Dictadura
de la Palabra.

2. Porque la palabra es de oro. Y la posee una sola persona, un político que
es al mismo tiempo el jefe de un Gobierno y el dueño de todos los medios de
comunicación que transportan la palabra.

3. Italia sólo en apariencia pertenece a la democracia europea. En realidad
es una forma de gobierno oriental a la manera de Heliogábalo. En noviembre
del 2001, un semanario hizo un reportaje, a la manera de los semanarios de
Heliogábalo, titulado Escritor, ¿por qué no hablas? Parece ser el caso de
repetir la pregunta. Porque si eventualmente un escritor contradice el
estruendo ensordecedor de las palabras de Heliogábalo, he aquí que de varios
lados se alzan voces acreditadas elogiando el silencio. Son voces que dicen:
el silencio es oro.

4. Pero el elogio del silencio no puede hacerse con palabras. Por coherencia
debería hacerse en silencio. Quienes invocan el Silencio utilizan la
Palabra. Incluso los escritores que elogian el silencio. ¿Pero a quién piden
silencio quienes elogian el silencio? ¿Se lo piden acaso a Heliogábalo? ¿O a
los pregoneros de Heliogábalo? ¿O a los mayordomos de Heliogábalo? ¿O a los
centuriones de Heliogábalo? ¿O a las pantallas televisivas de Heliogábalo?
¿O a los bandos impresos de Heliogábalo? No. Os lo piden a vosotros, que
habéis osado decir una palabra contra Heliogábalo y contra el imperio de
palabras de Heliogábalo.

5. Porque en el Reino de Heliogábalo no sólo la palabra es de oro. También
el silencio es oro.

6. Pero el proverbio dice que quien calla otorga.

7. La palabra es de oro, pero puede ser también de plomo. Se lee en el
Evangelio que ciertos individuos utilizados por el Sanedrín usaban la 'sica'
bajo la capa. La 'sica' era su instrumento de trabajo. Un puñal corto y
afilado, de golpe mortal. Bajo la capa de sus programas y de sus periódicos,
los agentes de Heliogábalo llevan palabras afiladas como 'sicas'. Pum, pum,
y estás muerto si no respetas el silencio. Palabras de plomo.

8. En el Reino de Heliogábalo se impone el silencio a golpes de pistola
catódica.

9. Ojo: ¿que has dicho una palabra contra el Reino de Heliogábalo? El
pregonero de Heliogábalo, en su programa televisivo, afirmará que estás de
parte de los terroristas. Un golpe de pistola catódica disparado como el
aguijón de una avispa. Avispa mortal.

10. Heliogábalo es feroz. Dispara. Y sobre todo ordena que se disparen
pistolas catódicas. Me pregunto: ¿es justo callar ante las pistolas
catódicas de Heliogábalo?

11. Cito de una enciclopedia médica: 'Laringe: Órgano hueco semirrígido,
formado por una serie de cartílagos unidos entre sí por ligamentos y
músculos. Sus funciones principales son: 1) la respiración; 2) la fonación,
es decir, la formación de sonidos, determinados por la contracción de los
músculos llamados cuerdas vocales'.

12. La fonación, es decir, el habla, es la facultad con la que la Naturaleza
(Dios, para quien lo prefiera) ha dotado a los hombres con el objeto de que
se distingan de los animales. La palabra nos caracteriza como criaturas
vivas y pensantes. Sin ella seríamos brutos. Y hechos no fuimos para vivir
como brutos, tal y como quisiera Heliogábalo.

13. Porque el silencio mata, la palabra crea. En principio era el Verbo y el
Verbo era la Vida. Y esto es el Evangelio.

14. Yo hablo porque existo. Cuando mi garganta esté llena de tierra dejaré
de hablar. Entonces será el silencio. Me aguarda una eternidad de silencio,
pero antes de que llegue el silencio eterno quiero usar mi voz. Mi palabra.

15. Yo hablo porque soy un escritor. La escritura es mi voz. Un escritor que
no habla no es un escritor. No es nada. ¿Quieren llenar mi garganta de
tierra? Se equivocan.

16. Pero vosotros también debéis hablar. Porque todos debemos hablar. Para
eso nos hizo la Naturaleza criaturas humanas. Con que digáis un solo 'NO',
Vuestra Naturaleza Humana quedará a salvo. Si permanecéis en silencio
habréis llenado vosotros mismos Vuestra boca de tierra. No seréis más que
unas orejas que escuchan las pistolas catódicas de Heliogábalo. Y eso es
exactamente lo que Heliogábalo quiere de Vosotros.

17. ¿Estáis seguros de que queréis delegar las pocas palabras que en la vida
tenéis que decir a los recaderos de Heliogábalo que cada día os hablan desde
la prensa de Heliogábalo y desde los tubos catódicos de Heliogábalo?

18. Atención: Heliogábalo está preparando una ley gracias a la cual Vuestra
boca estará llena de tierra y no seréis más que unas orejas listas para
recibir los mensajes de Heliogábalo. Con esta ley, será simultáneamente
Vuestro Jefe político y Vuestro Jefe espiritual. En el Reino de Heliogábalo
tal estratagema viene eufemísticamente llamada 'Ley sobre el conflicto de
intereses'. En realidad es la ley del Silencio. Un silencio de tumba en el
que sólo hablarán Heliogábalo, los mayordomos de Heliogábalo, los pregoneros
de Heliogábalo, los sicofantes de Heliogábalo.

19. El Reino de Heliogábalo cumple un sueño previsto hace años en Italia por
los compadres de Heliogábalo. Coged la lista de esos compadres, miráosla con
atención, que quizás os topéis con alguna sorpresa. Y acaso con alguna
sospecha. Porque éste es el momento de las sospechas.

20. Declaro abierta la era de la sospecha. Sospechad de todos, incluso de
quien os invita a cantos de fraternidad, y sobre todo de los padres
putativos. No todos son buenos carpinteros, y nunca se sabe a qué hijos
pródigos pueden estar protegiendo.

21. El plan previsto hace años por los compadres de Heliogábalo se llamaba
de otro modo, pero hoy podemos llamarlo 'Plan de Resurgimiento de la
Mordaza'. Una mordaza que garantiza el silencio.

22. Atención. El Reino de Heliogábalo está lleno de maestros. Pequeños
maestros. Se hacen pasar por buenos maestros, pero son malos, muy malos. Y
conminan a los escolares.

23. Atención: El arte de callar ya lo conoció el Reino de Heliogábalo entre
1922 y 1945. Es una vieja práctica, típica de cualquier régimen. Se llama
práctica de los enebros fragantes. En Italia, los Gramáticos de los enebros
fragantes han empezado a dictar sus decálogos: 'Esto es meritorio de
literatura, esto no es meritorio'. Atención, esos Gramáticos son peligrosos:
estableciendo arbitrariamente jerarquías enuncian un principio de censura. Y
la literatura, por el contrario, es ancha como la Vida, y no exige carta de
crédito alguna: en ella caben tanto el noble suicidio del joven Werther como
los calzones remendados del travieso Gavroque, el Paraíso de Dante junto al
pajarillo de Catullo, los Himnos a la noche de Hölderlin como los proverbios
de los Malavoglia y la Oda a la zanahoria de Neruda. Porque, como dijo un
gran poeta, todo vale la pena si el alma no es angosta. Y a eso sirve la
Palabra: a decir que el alma no es angosta.

24. Me acuerdo de Caserio. Me acuerdo de Sacco y Vanzetti. Me acuerdo de
Valpreda. Me acuerdo de Pinelli. Recuerdo todo lo que ha sucedido en Italia
en la posguerra y también durante la guerra. Los repubblichini de Mussolini
eran colaboracionistas de los nazis. Mataban y torturaban. Lo sé, lo sabe mi
familia y tengo documentos. Quienes dicen que eran 'muchachos de Saló' que
luchaban en cualquier caso por el honor de la Patria, mienten, sostienen una
falsedad histórica. Es necesario contradecirles. Para contradecirles hay que
hablar. Porque quien calla otorga.

25. Un semiólogo, hace años, ridiculizó a un pobre presentador de televisión
que parecía haberse convertido en el dueño de las noches de los italianos,
trazando su fenomenología. Y yo pregunto: ¿será posible que no haya ningún
doctor, hoy, en el Reino de Heliogábalo, que pueda trazar una fenomenología
de Heliogábalo? El material, desde luego, no falta, desde los numerosos
gestos briosos de Heliogábalo a su foto-biografía en colores. Resultaría un
trabajo algo más arriesgado, pero sin duda de gran utilidad para todos
nosotros. ¿Hay alguien que posea las palabras apropiadas para decirlo?

26. Mandar al diablo a todos aquellos que aman apelarse al silencio o que se
muestran pesimistas sería demasiado fácil. Por desgracia soy mucho más
pesimista de lo que parece: soy un falso optimista. He leído a Voltaire
mucho antes de esos revolucionarios que estaban en las barricadas haciendo
una revolución que después no llegó. Perdonadme, soy un intelectual burgués.
Llevo en el corazón la Palabra.

27. En Italia ya no se quiere meter tierra en la boca solamente a quienes
usan todavía la Palabra, a los escritores. Se quiere llenar de tierra la voz
de la Historia también.

28. Ha escrito el Grande Escritor de Praga: 'Escribir significa dar un salto
más allá del círculo de los asesinos'.

29. Ciudadanos: hablar significa dar un salto más allá del círculo de quien
quiere estrangularos. Escribid. Hablad.

30. Ciudadanos del Reino de Heliogábalo que aún creéis en la Palabra. Os han
asegurado que en el Reino de Heliogábalo hay un garante que para defenderos
puede firmar o no firmar la Ley de Heliogábalo. Pero sólo Vosotros sois los
garantes de vuestra voz, después de lo cual vuestra boca estará llena de
tierra. Si el presunto garante firma la Ley de Heliogábalo (o una parecida),
sólo os queda una cosa por hacer. Por eso hago un llamamiento, dirigido a
Vosotros y a todos aquellos que creen todavía en la voz humana. Porque en
principio era la Palabra. Heliogábalo quiere quedársela. Es responsabilidad
vuestra no dejársela.

Llamamiento: Coged una fotografía tamaño carné, con vuestro nombre y
dirección. Dibujad con un rotulador una mordaza sobre la boca de vuestra
fotografía y mandádsela al presidente del Consejo de Europa (Consejo de
Europa, Avenue de l'Europe, Palais de l'Europe, 67075 Strasburgo). No
mandéis vuestra fotografía a quien no os ha servido de garante. Los
centuriones de Heliogábalo dirían que no sois más que setecientos mil, como
dijeron de la manifestación en la que erais tres millones el 23 marzo 2002
en Roma. Vosotros sois millones, millones de personas en el Reino de
Heliogábalo amordazadas por Heliogábalo y por los garantes de Heliogábalo.
Veamos lo que dirá la Europa Unida cuya Carta se funda sobre la libertad de
Palabra. Hablemos, amigos, hablemos. Después vendrá el Silencio.

En el Reino de Heliogábalo, a 3 de abril de 2002.

Usually I stay away from the politics here but Mr. Brink's remarks have set
me off.  You seem to be coming from the "my country love or leave it" school
or the updated Ashcroft version which says that any kind of dissent is aiding
and abetting "the enemy."

We all know where the former got us.  I suspect the latter is going to take
us to a similar place.

break even: money received from sales of titles has yet to match money

salaries involved: none, i do all the work myself

chapbooks are distributed through spd, & are advertised via
durationpress.com (& not to be outright self-congradulatory, but is, to my
mind, quite an online presence...not just for myself, but for well over 35
small presses), among other venues (when i am able, i run an ad in a
journal...usually when the ad space is free)...

at any rate, as i said before, you give it a shot & see how you do...

Dear Friends,

I hate my country and I'm trying to leave it but all the other countries
show the same movies so there is no escape.  I am the enemy and I am trying
to arrest myself except that I discovered that I am not smart enough.  I am
anti-Israel.  I am a Jew, and I have no problem with being a rootless
cosmopolitan, or, as Ben-Gurion said, human dust.  I love America because
it is one big human dust bowl.  I do not favor the Two-State Solution in
the Middle East.  Rather, I favor the No-State Solution.  Neither side
deserves a state, only a shopping center.  Or if they do, it should be
North Dakota.  Now that my government has withdrawn from the ABM, the Kyoto
Accords, the International Court, and all the rest, I have decided to
withdraw from the English language.  You may think you are reading English
right now, but you are not.  You are reading enemy propaganda.

I wouldn't think they would want to - they've apparently derived a great
deal of publicity out of their interpretaions ofthe 'incident' and have
developed an expertise in sowing dissent and acrimony on other lists.  This
comment does not reflect on all four, however.

You know a thing is moribund when it gets taught in college seminars and
reprinted in college anthologies -- especially if the thing was meant for
seminars and anthologies all along, as would seem to be often the case
today.

Here's an observation (or is it a manifesto):

Academics love thinking of literature in terms of avant-gardes and
manifestos, notions that went out of date in 1914.  The rhetoric of
avant-gardism visibly infects their own discourse, as when some stupid
article in _Critical Inquiry_ is described as "insurgent,"
"interventionist," etc.  In the 1980s and 1990s, Language writers tapped
into this academic romance and profited by it (i.e., they got teaching
jobs, _My Life_ became a best-seller, etc.).  But this academic love of
all-things-insurgent has pauperized advanced poetry criticism and spawned a
bunch of little dictators (I mean, like Chaplin).  We need to get away from
the academic terms of analysis.

(N.B., I speak as someone who owns the Black Sparrow reprints of both BLAST
I and II.)

a manifesto, if you will


 poetry is the
  real                                                  thing.

 i'm not sure why people have always felt

threatened by the dreamers.
it doesn't fit
into our

post enlightment

'reason beyond anything' paradigm.  concepts such as truth, justice and
 love thy brother are not rational but that does not make them
irrational.  just
a rational.

                                beyond(

and i would argue, transcendent of) reason.

  we are so
much

 slaves to binary    thinking.

              black     white
    yes      no
 good      bad
    .          why
    are      we
          afraid    of
  colour   ?



                   what

is it about
borderblur that frightens
us?
we want

things to fit
into neat
little




boxes.
is this


                                        why plato wanted to get
rid of the artists? they had                  the audacity to think in
new ways. in            places like             harris' onterrible we must
be x-tra vigilant.
 failure to see
the work of poets as
 real may only be a symptom          of the effects of the anesthesia
 that
 the rhythm of reason has become.

I Reply:

I've started to write on this thread several times, each time deleting it.
And now it seems I don't need to reply at all, for Ian has pretty much
said it all. And a good thing too, because I couldn't quite get myself

Someone want to tell me?
Either way, I'm usually all for making peace.

Look. We're  all probably a bit crazy: I dont hate "Israel" either, or
Israelis, in fact my grandfather (lived in London) was (according to my
Uncle) Jewish:  and I was trying to verify this via Ancestry dot com.  I
think (he "fell out" with my father). He may have decided to "un Jew"
himself  as he was a kind of social climber and so on: he actually made
money out of the war (part fluke part the right investments) and so on. But
I was interested as we are all interested in out origins: all I could find
was that (his name was Aaron Samuel Taylor) there was someone in London who
got married of that name: but the Ancestry.com kept throwing me back to the
United States (the British I donbt think - this is a generalisation - have
this vast impulse: forgive me: its an American thing (generalisation again I
know)): even the Mormons (for its they I believe who run Ancestry) aren't
free from the "American disease": that said, I encounter it in New
Zealand...the good and bad aspects of a kind of determined insularity: and
the US is like a vast Island..here the tendency is to either reject anything
from America (those often "follow" British poets with equal slavishness) or
the better one is eg I think our better poets such as Smithyman and even
Wystan Curnow and his father Alan are very much in NZ and "in" such places
as Venice or NY: one excellent thing by his (Wystan's) has one side of the
page with a dialogue and a progress up the "spiral" of the Guggenheim and
the other side of the page the poem is ascending Mount Rangitoto the one in
Auckland basically means Sky = rangi  and toto = blood...but I think that
poem/image is good: it pays homage to world culture and maoritanga (and
polynesian culture as Rangitoto will be familiaras a word in possibly Hawai)
and also works with language and new forms etc ...So for many even
discussion of American modenism is out let alone langauge poetry etc).  I
dont want to tread  on graves: the history of Israel is complex and fraught:
butit is true that they (the Israelis) are in a land that was once not
their's ...they are a disparate group from many lands and cultures: they
then have pushed beyond even their original boundaries: and some of my
knowledge  of what goes on I got from an ex-Israeli soldier who disguised
himself as a Palestinian: now this didnt condemn _everything_ about Israel
(but it didnt look good either), but even he had grave doubts about the
direction that Israel was taking (the book came out just prior to the first
Intifada)
   But to get back to my own situation: I wanted to know if my grandfather
was Jewish and then I would (apart from curiosity about origins) see how I
felt about the Israel/Palestine situation, whether eg I still felt that
suicide bonmbing (given the circumstances of the Palestinians)
was/were/should be justified or at least explicable: it would certainly
affect my thinking....I have no idea though: as my brother looks: well he
looks Semitic: which means he could be (originated genetically) from the
Middle East.
  But then ancestry.com a wanted money so I backed off! After all "the now"
is the most important time: for now any case.
  I dont think we should worry what we throw at each other: I dont think any
of us would actually kill either an Israeli or a Palestinian, at this stage
(if the war expands we might all have to decide on that one): and my
"attack" on Israel is still valid but its not anti-Jewish or even
necessarily anti Israel: the bad guys I see over there are mainly the RW
Israelis and the more fanatic military aggressors: the extreme Zionists.
Its time now for UN  intervention and a questioning of US and Israeli
policy: a creation of two separate states of equal (more or less)
standing...  But Mr Brink has a right to speak out. Richard.

The reason I would vote to keep Henry Gould, for example, off this listserv,
is structural, not personal. When I can choose, I am happy to read his posts
in other places (there is a plethora of listservs and online venues out
there). I would probably like Henry Gould very much, in person. Isn't that
neat? But this is beside the point.

In the past, there has been a tendency for null points (to use Barrett
Watten’s brilliant term), collectively somehow generated, to dominate
discussion, which means: to rhetorically temper and flatten extremes of
difference, of intensity, of specificity; to narcissistically maintain a
center of attention and focus despite all efforts to veer elsewhere and
establish multiple points of interest by multiple participants. This null
condition, when it occurs (as it will on occasion) is bearable, I personally
find, so long as it remains unintended, because then, when it is brought to
attention somehow, things can change.

Here goes... "Henry Gould" not only articulated null points, he made them
his art form, so much and with such unwavering relish, disregarding repeated
warnings by posting under multiple pseudonyms upwards of ten times a day,
that the entire listserv became completely and irrevocably The Null Point!!
He was such a bad boy.

I am not saying how I would vote if it came to "Henry Gould," for example,
now, but I am saying one reason why I would vote No if it came to voting No.

As to the other Ejected Four, I wasn’t around to read their posts. And since
I don’t conceive of this listserv to be The be-all-and-end-all Listserv, and
of the moderators as delivering commandments for all poetry time (in which
case, they do indeed become Fallen Angels, unable ever to post to poetry
listservs again, anywhere...but this is completely untrue), I don’t feel any
ethical compunction to spend time investigating the record. Sorry! That's my
initial reaction.

Listen, I must admit that I only read Rachel Tzvia
Back's book of poems because she wrote a book on Susan
Howe. I was just following a river to its source I
guess.

But it is a beautiful book with a very complicated and
complex understanding of life in Israel and the West
Bank. I really want to recommend it to people--no
matter what the belief or opinion on current situation
in Israel/Palestine. It's a testament of a human
spirit.

Another book I can't say enough about (and so will say
not-much-about) is Mahmoud Darwish's book Memory for
Forgetfulness from UC Press, a prose-memoir of the
invasion of Lebanon. As predictable with Arabic prose,
it pretty much defies description or genre. The
translation is the only one I've ever read of Darwish
that quite manages to reflect his work...

Oh the Back book is called Azimuth and pub info is on
my signature...

To be fair I attacked Israel originally: it was a bit emotive and my
terminology was maybe a bit "over the top" but I did attack ... I used the
term "Israeli Nazis": I know that this is pretty much "on the nose" but
people know me by now: its rhetoric I use when I'm very concerned about
things...it doesnt reflect the "whole truth" (wherever and whatever that is)
per se:  this is probably why I and others got called cretins...but that
aside, I'm still concerned about the sudden "interest" in Iraq: the
situation is so messy now in Palestine that one wonders who will ever gain
from all this: there is a need to speak out about the Israelis but also for
a _real_ intervention by the (new, revamped?) UN (a UN NOT ruled and vetted
or vetoed by the big powers - the US isnt the only culprit here). The two
countries may need to be forced to set up separate states: I know that the
problem of Jeruslem is fraught (after all Christians and others have a
strong interest there as well as the Israelis and the Palestinians)but that
is the only hope after a withdrawal by the Israeli military and aid into
both countries (more to Palestine) and so on. I am in this case in favour of
intervention (as the  - "more reasonable" Palestinians ) and some other Arab
and countries (I think Greece as a "Christian country" supports the
Palestinians): it isnt neccessary for suicide bombings or Israeli military
strikes to happen forever: there have been great injustices: but there has
to be a settlement. But I dont see the need for intervention into Iraq: aid
yes. It's stupid talking about the danger of Iraq. It wont be long before
every man and his dog has a nuke in their pocket: but it _is _ true ,
justified or not, that the US dropped the first nukes, then went on to
firebomb Korea and Vietnam and so on and on and on.  The US aids Israel but
not South Africa or Palestine or even Afghanistan to any significant extent.
However not all of what the US does is bad news and i;m not someone who
automatically attacks the US (after all it is IN the US that many protests
and civil rights movemnts began while other countries were stagnating)
(Russia is in a sorry state, and for me personally there are many other
"bad" countries....point is that we in the West have less excuses for our
'badneses'... I suppose: NZ is in a sense  - well it is - allied to the US:
now that would be good with a US eg under a Roosevelt or even if the liberal
guy - forget his name - had got in... but right now its a worry ... but if I
was madly anti-US I wouldnt be on this list...When all's said and done I am
a European and much of my eculturation is (aprt from NZ) comes via Britain
(the Brits need a rev up as well..... but...) and also the US..but also of
course other historical connections etc...Richard.
PS I;m glad you dont agree with all of (if any) of my ideas as I often
disagree with them myself: but its because I hate aggression and war and
hypocrisy. Hence I tend to rave...Sed, humanum est errare.

couple of things that cough t my attention...  what happens to a manifesto
when it is owned?  and plato thought poets?? distracted people from the work
required for the republic because of their proximity to falsity.   distant
from the ideals.  and since they proposed representations of real things,
representations being once removed from the actual thing which is once
removed from the ideal, he thought people would get caught up in a world of
falsity. really the dramatists, they're the problem, but poets and
dramatists....   and words, and well, there.   so what happens to a
manifesto when it can be owned?  would we recognize a manifesto if we saw
one these days?  or is the genre, there, it is a genre, are they too
identifiable, too exclusive, too subjective, too obvious?  how to make
something manifest.  is it that manifested.  o.  look a quagmire...
inderminate manifestation.  binarism.  look i'm a manifesto.

 the academy is composed of itself and its foil, in reductivist thinking.
isn't this place big enough for a non-sequitur.  raoul hausmann teaching the
classics at whatever university.  some choose column A, some choose
something other than a column.  some column choice and dance the way of the
mongoose.  this is far too serious.  blast.  drums and oranges.

Rhode Island, a small state in the USA.)


                                                                       THE
RHODIAN CREDO

Of Minimalism.                               The Rhodians accept a simple
definition of poetry, ie.:
Poetry  =  rhythmic/measured language.  The features often attributed to
poetry, such as imagination, intellect, emotion, pathos, unity of affect,
knowledge, communication, dream, and so forth, are
understood to be features of consciousness and language in general.  Poetry
bears the imprint of both consciousness and language, but its distinguishing
trait is rhythm, pattern, measure.  The Rhodian
approach precludes tendentious, apologetic or polemical appropriations of
features of general consciousness into specialized definitions of what poetry
should or should not be.  Rhodians believe that the
compositional attributes of poems are all free additions to the simple nature
of poetry so defined.


Of Continuity.                        The Rhodians believe that poetry as an
art form is distinguished by its continuity.  “Poetry is avant-garde because
it doesn’t change much.”  Rhodians declare that each poet and
each group of poet-friends is responsible for, and eligible to inherit, the
bequest of past poetry in its entirety.  Poetry as simply defined passes
through the hands of its makers to its audience of hearers and
other makers; it is molded by their personalities and the experience of their
time on earth.  It is a human art form, perhaps shared to some extent with
other creatures.


Of Purpose.                                    The Rhodians maintain that
there is no particular “correct” way to make poetry.  But this does not
preclude the Rhodians from choosing certain principles and
orientations.  One such principle is that poetry-making involves a limited,
but sufficient  and self-sufficient  autonomy.  If the process is not valuable
for its own sake it is not worth doing at all, since it
makes no claim to be valuable for any other reason. (Here the Rhodians follow
the orientation of fellow Rhodian, and former Cranston native, Ted Berrigan.)
Another such principle is that poetic autonomy
is linked with a realist approach.  Rhodians reject sceptical trends which
question our ability to posit the existence of a real world outside our verbal
formulations (even though Rhodians would like to reside
on an island).  Rhodians assert their ability to make true statements about
the real world (at least within the limitations of verbal representation in
general), and assent to the influence of that capability on their
poetry.  In fact Rhodians believe that the human impulse to respond to
reality, in all its consciousness and specificity, is something of an artistic
opportunity for which they can be grateful.  Finally, the
Rhodians reject theories of poetics which devalue the communicative function,
reifying denatured words upon the page.  For the Rhodians, language is
essentially communicative  the propositional,
interrogatory, evaluative, expressive making of signs.  Within the continuum
of such gestures, words play a combinatory and supportive role.  So, while
recognizing the special quality of language in art and
poetry--the “focus on message” or reflexive aspect described by
Jakobson--Rhodians acknowledge the fundamental semaphoric aspect of the
medium.

CALL FOR PAPERS / TRANSLATIONS

Special issue of Metamorphoses: A Journal of Literary Translation,
Vol. 11, no. 1, Spring 2003: Francophone literature.

We welcome submissions of translations of literature written in
=46rench (or languages or dialects derived from French) outside of
=46rance. Short articles on that literature may accompany the
translations. Work by writers and poets living in France, but whose
work reflects their post-colonial heritage, will be equally welcome.

We are interested in literature written in non-standard French and
=46rancophone idioms such as Cr=E9ole, Cadien and Qu=E9becois, and by work
in standard French from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and North
America. Translations of work by non-French Europeans will not be
excluded.

Previously unpublished translationsaccompanied, if you wish, by
reflections on translating such writingmust reach the editors by
October 15th, 2002.

=46or poetry translations, send hard copy of both the original and the
translation (and article, if you send one), and electronic copy of
both as well. (And S.A.S.E. if you wish to have your manuscript
returned.)
=46or prose, send hard copy of the original and the translation, and
electronic copy only of the translation / article. (And S.A.S.E. as
above.) For prose we prefer short stories, but we will consider a
chapter of a novel if it can stand by itself.
Translators are responsible for obtaining permission to reprint
copyrighted material, and for obtaining translation rights when
necessary. Copyright of translations remains with the translators. We
ask only that previous publication in Metamorphoses be acknowledged
if text is reprinted.

Hey P+O+E+T+I+C+S types,

Well, I'm reading Vol. 32 # 1 of The Iowa Review right now, and it
touches on some of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E that recently
bounced around on the Poetics Discussion List.

It kicks off with an interesting 38 page essay on "Poetic
Communities," and then after some interesting poetry from the likes
of Cole Swensen and Matthew Rohrer, has a 60 page section titled
"Craft, Critique, Culture," with these pieces:

Alan Golding, "'Isn't the avant garde always pedagogical':
Experimental Poetics and / as Pedagogy"
Mark Levine, "Writing it: Some Observations on the Poetics of
Territoriality"
Bob Perelman, "Self-Portrait with Language Writing"
Kevin Kopelson, "Critical Virtuosity"
Rebecca Clouse, "Genre bending with Cixous"
Kass Fleisher, "Scenes from the Battlefield: A Feminist Resists the
Writing Workshop"
Steve Tomasula, "An Apology for Postmodern Prose"
Roundtable exerpts from a discussion between Alan Golding, Mark
Levine, Bob Perelman, and Thomas Swiss . . .

Oh, and yes, The Iowa Review has submission guidelines . . .

FYI,
    JGallaher

Geesch. Has not even one title paid for the cost of printing it? What _is
the cost per copy? The number of impressions? This is just straight one
color offset right? There are digital print solutions that would be much
more cost effective especially for shorter runs. (Actually I have
self-published titles -- weboffset on newsprint; perfect-bound; full bleed
images -- that at least paid for the print costs... admittedly it took
quite a few years...)

Some keywords that seem to materialize in this discussion --

melodrama
cri de coeur
emotion
sentiment: positive=20
sentiment: negative
sentiment: formal
sentiment: informal
sentiment: cloying
sentiment: moving
quote moving: unquote: moving to whom?  to whom, when and where?

Well, it=92s become evident that all of the above (plus whatever variations=20=
of=20
same one could come up with) can be supplied with plus or minus signs --=20
i.e., they totally depend on writers=92 and readers=92 social, cultural, per=
sonal=20
histories and situations.  For instance, I find Rilke cloying, Oppen=20
tremendously moving.  I find both of them rather humorless, which seems a=20
flaw (not fatal in Oppen=92s case).  But the construction of a globally=20
applicable field theory of sentimentality strikes me as an impossible task.=20=
=20

I listen to all the chatter on the news and hear the same us/them rhetoric
I've heard all my life. The rhetoric is what needs to be changed. It's
language that provokes, and language that heals. Treaties are language.
Peace talks are language. Fundamentalist religions are about language. As is
poetry. One chooses one's enemy as one chooses one's words.

<P>Hi Kari, </P>
<P>Thank you for filling in those gaps! I would add works by&nbsp;Aphra Behn, Mary Daly, Gertrude Stein (yes precisely because you can't put your finger on it), Vine Deloria Jr.'s writings (Custer Died for Your Sins, for example), Mae West, Anita Loos; I could go on. I have found works by all of these writers very liberating and exciting at many times exactly because of the lack of fear of extremes within them, which to me is part of the being and use of a manifesto. &amp; I love Valerie Solanas for going so far (in her writing; I'm not endorsing the gun use.)</P>
<P>Laura Riding's The Word Woman.</P>

I think all four of the parties mentioned have a lot to offer the list, as
much as I may object to some of their conduct in the past (I'm only speaking
of some of them, since I don't know all of them, and only to the extent that
I am informed, since I don't know the nature of all the "offenses" involved
in all cases).

I move (am I authorized to "move" things?) that they all be readmitted, on a
probationary basis or whatever, in the interest of the furthering of free
and productive discourse.

Naturally, of course, any future incidents of clearly non-ironic
name-calling, flaming, etc., from _any_ parties should not be tolerated.
Like calling people "cretins" for expressing their political beliefs, just
for example.

i'm sure this won't be of any use (since it's not published) to the original
post-er, but...

Manifest

The poem is a topological space.

The poem is situated on a topological space.  The "blank" space of the page
is not "blank."  It is volatile; it is active.  Words may be in one place
and may shift to another place.  It is porous and unstable.  Words may falls
into faults or cracks in the page.  It is spongy.  Different places on the
page have different weights and gravitational pulls.  This affects placement
of words.  Words may become unrecognizable due to geographic activity.

Meaning is secondary to sight.  Meaning must be collected in a treasure hunt
through the page.  Meaning is one of many possible maps through a page.
Meaning is only possible on the level of the page.  The page's topology
determines meaning.  The words' geological placement determines meaning.
History determines meaning.  The reader's specific travels determine
meaning.

Sound is secondary to sight.  The page is not a score for reading.  The poem
need not be read aloud.  The "blank" spaces of the page are not "scored."
The "blank" spaces of the page are not equal.  Some spaces are more blank
than others.  Some blank spaces are larger than other blank spaces that may
look equal.  "Blank" spaces can be bridged, like a wormhole rather than like
a musical measure.  Sound comes after recognition.

The poem is a set of topological figures or features.  Words are subject to
disintegration, death, and other natural events that individuals of all
types face.  The words on the page represent the page at a certain
geological moment.  This moment implies a history.  This moment entails a
future.  The reader sees merely a moment captured.  The moment could have
been otherwise.

The "level of the page" is the only level.  The vertical "reader to page"
and "author to page" and "author to reader" relationships are eradicated.
The horizontal journey through the page, as a hiker on a trail, is the only
way to search for meaning.  As such meanings will be different for each
traveler.  As such meaning is made through memory.  Connections are delayed,
soundings are delayed, meaning is delayed.  Meaning is put together.  As
such meaning is a compound impression of a physically traversed space (the
eye moves physically through the space as the mind encounters fragmented
signifiers).

Each poem is a microcosm.

The poem and the page become topological at the same time; as the reader
traverses their space, he or she perceives a shifting, coming-into-being
topology.

This is essential, and could be placed side by side with much of Ronald

I like this very much. I've been working with some of these elements for
years, but could use this to expand into areas I haven't reached as yet.
It's very open, with interesting possibilities.

Any Middle Eastern poetics scholars in the mix? I'm
putting together a syllabus and would like to include
a combination of poems by contemporary Middle
Eastern-American poets writing in English and good
translations of prominent Middle Eastern poets, but I
find my knowledge of the aforementioned woefully
inadequate. Any leads would be much appreciated.

Thanks,

I was at the John Weiners memorial tribute last night
at MIT in Cambridge and just wanted to offer this
report.

The night was incredibly rainy and there is very
little parking around there and the room was in this
endless, dehumanizing building where it is completely
possible to lose yourself, and yet the night itself
was infinitely touching and beautiful, and the room
completely packed.  It was incredible for me, as a
young poet, to see so many poets in one room from the
previous generations: Anne Waldman, Ed Sanders, Lew
Warsh, Fanny Howe, etc., and it was glorious and
vibrant to see them together as a community.  I felt
connected to an incredible, alive lineage of poetic
activity.  The audience was a great mix of younger and
older poets, poets of various backgrounds, all out to
pay tribute to Weiners.  The Boston scene (to which I
am a recent emigre) can often feel too segregated and
chilly, but there was great love in that room last
night.

The work itself (almost everyone, in great deference
to typical poetic ego, read just one or two short
poems by JW) was mind-blowing.  "Hair-splitting,"
someone said, and it really was...so completely pure.
A  great reminder of what poetry can do, and I wrote
to myself in my notebook the following directions
based on his work: "be ALWAYS direct.  Be completely
fully in the poem.  Go further.  Reach the blood.  Be
vulnerable.  Strip it out."

I also wrote:
Warm runs the night tonight in Boston, my god.
The planets are lined up like porcelain pool balls
and the constellations are aflame.
Everyone's haeat is in the same place.

What an incredible tribute--to John Weiners and to the
power of poetry.  My thanks to all who contributed and
came.


Arielle

As far as I'm concerned the real issue here is spamming and not the
personalites of the parties in question much as they would like to
personalize the issue..

THIS IS AN ANALOGY AND NOT BASED ON PERSONS LIVING OR DEAD

If you are ata party and aloud drunk dominates the gathering do you ask her
to leave because she's too loud or because you don't like her?

Do you extend a return invitation based on her poetry publications or
knowledge?  or is it based on her not drinking?

Do you know about her promise to not drink based on her word, a breath test,
number of DUIs in the past year, etc.?

or do you go by present behavior and give her another chance?

THIS IS AN ANALOGY AND NOT BASED ON PERSONS LIVING OR DEAD

Granting another chance wouldbe the enlightened thing to do but I'm not sure
that once a spammer always a spammer.

Vernon, Gerald, et al,

This manifesto tempts me, but I cannot figure out what is meant by the
page's "topology." I would think "topography" would be more accurate if what
is meant is its material character.  "Topology" means (in Jessica's apparent
usage) "the history of a region as indicated by its topography"--- which
makes the difference between topology and topography essentially the same as
the difference between historiography and history.  (Is the history of
pornography "pornology"?)  Am I missing something?  It reminds me of when
"simplistic" gets used to mean "simple."  The former, an abstraction away
from the latter, has a different meaning.

Beyond that, how can a poem be "on" a "space"?   In fact how is a
"topological space" different from any other space?   How can a poem *be* a
set of topological features?  Would it not rather *have* those features?  I
can't make sense of this.

But I agree that it sounds inspirational.  And Jessica probably didn't post
it for me to hack the shit out of!!

Admittedly less familiar with math/science terms than other terms, & willing
to be educated,

Joel,  I haven't been following this thread so my thoguht might be tangental
but I'll toss it in anyway.

It seems to me the problem is that poetry all too oftenbecomes part of the
rhetoric that divides - see trotsky on this and all the anthologies we will
soon see of poetsfor or poetsagainst.

I wonder if there might be another course that might be taken - poets
dealing with the rhetoric?

Leonard: I tend not to read postings that have certain subject headings or
that are written by certain contributors; it save me time better spent on
almost anything else. I did notice the original posting by Mr. Tyler. It
got me upset for a few minutes until I realized that the poster doesn't
really understand the dictionary meanings of the words "evil", "corrupt",
"terroristic", "fascist" or even "most". Therefore, I didn't bother responding.

I realize that I'm contributing to a flame war now and so I will go back to
lurking.

Best regards.

Arielle's moving report on the Weiner memorial followed quick by Tom Bell's
psychobabble complaint in re:  spammers moved me.  Hey!  It was such a
discordant juxtaposition.  I can't let it go without comment.

Why _would_ the fabled four wish to come back to this?  It is a mystery
wrapped in a tortilla disguised as dialectical argument that looks like a
burrito. Eat it, please.

I want a big pepper.  I want another glass of wine.  I want  to read words

Changing the rhetoric. Political poetry--a genre that shouldn't exist, as
politics is a branch of one's lungs--seems about one taking sides. Okay. But
then, can't the making of the poem be a process of breaking down those
sides? Good fences don't make good communities, nor a nation, certainly not
a world. With the event of the World Wide Web, it seems to me we are moving
toward a world poetry, not collected but freshly generated. In view of this,
what should one's rhetoric be?

I'm not an expert, either, and I prefer the five cent word to the fifty.

I took topology, topography or whatever to be the page or the "field of
composition," as Olson might have called it. The sheet of paper or the
computer screen would be the space in which the poem as printed matter and
content takes place, at least from a physical standpoint. What happens in
the reader's head is another matter. The topological space is a page of
paper or a computer screen and each has physical limits, e.g. the size of
the paper or the screen.

I don't know if I want to have a debate about the difference between having
and being. The poem is there on the page, either way.Where its words appear
on the page and the patterns they appear in can alter their meaning. Blank
space can make a reader pause. Sometimes I use lines whose margins move to
the left to create a visual tension by reading sort of right to left  that
one doesn't experience in reading left to right,


something

                                                            like this

                                    for example.

I interpreted her piece my own way. Maybe she'll tell me I got it all wrong.
But it sounded inspirational, like somebody saying we have an open field, so
go play on it and make up your own games.

By the way, I liked your ideas about getting a little more introductory hype
at readings. It makes the audience more receptive. If nothing else, the
compliment motivates me to read better.

Anyway, there's my take on the Post-2000 Manifesto.

I want to add a few words to explain my last paragraph in the post headed
The Ejected Four. Its purpose was not to demonstrate how callous and
indifferent I personally can be, for instance to those ejected from this
listserv. The intent was focused on the question of listserv structure.

If this listerv is conceived of as a time-based project, then one thing that
means is that it has a specific history, a set of given purposes, vectors,
problems, assumptions to do with poetry. Some, not others. On some specific
terms, not other specific terms. Et cetera.

If that's the case, then this listserv is not the-be-all-and-end-all, in any
way, nor is it intended to represent and uphold all of contemporary poetry
to everyone. What this then means is, necessarily -- as Not Nice as this is
to say -- it's not structured "for everyone," in order to appeal to some
idea of Everyone-Man.

This listserv issues from Language Poetry's history, as well as all the
histories of poetry that that label has invoked and/or adjusted a bit to
refract, ever so slightly, through its nonreflecting mirror, rightly or
wrongly. Whether one agrees or not with Watten's suggested linkage
specifically of this listserv to _Legend_ (1980), and to the problematic of
_Legend_ and the question of the subject in/of language, doesn't matter on
this point of historical precedent itself, because the fact is that this
listserv *was* set up by Bernstein and *does* issue from SUNY-Buffalo and by
implication therefore *is* nudged like an ugly rotting pip next to a twisted
rhizome-root of SUNY-Buffalo, however tangentially, as this listserv
record's early days attest. In other words, this is not a listserv set up
and overseen by other equally specific and worthy institutions and places
with their own specific histories -- for instance, by The Jack Kerouac
School of Disembodied Poetics, or by the Montreal Spoken Word scene, or by
Iowa, or by Bard College, or by the North American Centre for
Interdisciplinary Poetics, or by Slought.net, or by Alienated.net, and so
on.

A lot of the hijinx performed on this listerv in the 90s was premised more
on the idea that this listserv was an appeal to Everyone-Man in his
self-appointed Complete Freedom. Regardless of what one thought of the way
that the relation of the present tense to the past -- figured as "Language
Poetry" -- was discussed on this listserv back then in pre Henry Gould times
(the discussion was, for the most part, figured as a generational conlict,
that I, for one, although mostly a lurker then, did not agree with, as my
recent post, Tue, 30 Apr 2002 03:04:45 -0600, and one on the Third Factory
site, http://www.umit.maine.edu/~steven.evans/3F-24, imply), whatever one
thought about that discussion "then," it fell, together with the entire
structure of this listserv, built as it is out of subjects (in both senses
of that word), to the wayside, once HG created Everyone Man of the Null
Points.

To suggest that there is a historical locatedness for this listserv is not
to suggest, let alone recommend or even imply, by any means, that "we
should" hold ourselves and the present tense accountable only to the past
and to a correct rendering of it on its terms -- by no means whatsoever!
There is something salutary and exhilarating in "forgetting" (provided one
once "knew," in some sense, in the first place), for instance, as a
processual strategy, and, of course, there are lots of other strategies, new
problems as well, new histories all the time to acknowledge, et cetera.

Ok that's it for me.

Mark Ford's recent "Raymond Roussell and the Republic of Dreams," (Cornell
UP, 2000) with foreward by John Ashbery, would be the best book in English
for starting in on Roussel--the photographs of Roussel are particularly
worthwhile.  Ford and Ashbery gave a fascinating talk on Roussel in NY about
a year ago.  Locus Solus is still, I think, out of print in English--but it
was readily available in French in Paris as of last summer.  Trevor
Winkfield's "How I Wrote Certain of My Books" (Exact Change) shouldn't be
too hard to find.

<P>Hi Jessica, Thanks for posting that. I like your choice of the word/idea topology -- it makes lots of sense to me (and I find it heartwarming and exciting!). The only part that I'd add two more cents about is the assertions that both meaning and sound are secondary to sight. To me they are equally part of the topology; which is not to say that they are fixed.</P>

By topology I mean to also include topography.

And i mean physical-historical space.  and i mean the physical exertion of
reading.  so i definitely mean "experiential" as well as theoretical.
Vernon seems to have a handle on it.

well, this is what's special about the manifesto, right?

if you get your mind around how a "flat" poem is a "real" (3D+ space), then
that's the issue.

Listen, if posters to this list want to be idiots, that's up to each
individual. But the "Rules" (guidelines) I posted before are for the
benefit of the hardware (UB web severs) and discourse (people --
particularly those who receive the list digest).

Please pull your heads out of the sand to consider them.
______________________________
        =20
        =20
For instance, a recent HTML message sent in by ET archives as a *bunch
of junk* no person, now or forever in the future, will ever take the
time to try and cognate through the mess of presentation markup (this is
also what the subscribers to the digest get with HTML):

http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=3Dind0205&L=3Dpoetics&D=3D=
1&P=3D6
845


So why do people like ET insist on destroying efforts to document
enlightened discourse?

Why do people like her insist on making sure recipients of her message
have to *squint* to read tiny-text which they have no control over
because it is not in plain text?

Why?
 =09

__________________

Again, here are the facts:

* Plain text email leaves the choice of formatting options to the user.
It is accessible by all email programs. Since it is just plain text, it
is usually at least 75% smaller in disk-size. HTML email is a bloated
authorial markup which dictates (font-size) and excludes (proprietary,
server parsing issues).

* Blindly quoting entire posts, over and over again, results in *less
and less* effective search capabilities because individual posts are
diluted with 'blindly quoted' (already-archived) material.

In other words, when you do a search you get at least twice as much as
what you wanted returned because everything is posted twice (or more)!

(That's 50% repeated content you have to wade through! Most appreciated
by list digest subscribers, I am sure.)

Search engines, do not understand you are actually just *really lazy and
hate the world* -- they spend just as much time, indexing and going
through entire posts you blindly quoted, as they do with your original
message (double-work since the engine has already archived the blind
quote).

This practice is worse than spammers, junk mailers, tele-marketers, or
commuter's gridlock.

For blind repliers and HTML'ers, "...Two roads diverged in the woods,
and they -- they cut down a barricade to make sure everyone else has a
more difficult time getting through." It is malicious.=20

The list is archive by thread or 'Topic' (in addition to date, author).
It is obvious, then, that blindly quoting entire posts as practice is
redundant, confirms a distinction of ignorance to the poster who does
it, and just leads to *a lot* of extra work by the UB web servers to
deal with all the extra content (prompting list server crashes, other
problems).

(By behaving and getting real you can surely decrease web server
archiving and broadcast activity generated by this list by more than 50%
-- how would you like to be 50% more efficient or relevant? -- i.e.
isn't worthwhile? Or do you just enjoy being an typical American -
knowing you are using many, many, more resources than you require?)

Just by realizing the tiniest bit of decorum necessary to follow
established guidelines for email archiving, particularly if your list is
concerned with discourse of a scholarly topic, you can make it so much
easier for others to gain wisdom from your involvement.=20

Not giving a crap about your actions, or others, (doing it 'your' way),
only confirms a group of narcissistic ego-happy masturbators who can
only get off on the sound of their own voice and reading their own posts
(since they only care about themselves - they don't care how others will
receive their message).
=20
How much *faith* do you think users have in content which is a
hodge-podge of occlusion without any boundaries or definitions (focus)
-- in other words, a useless pile-of-crap to try and reference, and
unusable as a resource, for the above mentioned reasons, and more.

Furthermore, it just makes you look stupid and ignorant of very *basic*
and common goals of any reading list -- to be a resource for future
discourse, one which can be referenced and navigated.=20

The answer is very simply, and if you look around at the vast majority
of discussion lists, hardly a sacrifice to implement -- REPLY IN
CONTEXT, EDIT QUOTED MESSAGES.
=20
To Christopher, as a side note, the list should not be publishing
private email addresses on their web servers, rather stripping those out
before archiving. (This is a common privacy practice).

You may now resume being an idiot or gain appreciation.

sorry for the short emails...

hi elizabeth...

i guess what i "mean" by 2ndary-ness is not that... they are "less
important" but that they are "less immediate."  i mean this mostly as a
response to the kids of the book machine.  that when i write th                 u




        s

i do not read

"th"
"uh"
"s"

like sesame street, slowing the pronunciation of the word to its phonemes,
because when i am tracking the phonemes onthe page, i do not find them
until they have become a word.  which does not mean that there is only one
possible word--in many of my poems, each phoneme is used multiple times and
each letter group can be pronounced differently depending on what path the
reader chooses.  in other words, wheni read non-linearly (it's more obvious
with the text above that everyone will eventually come up with the same
pronunciation of "thus") i find differnet paths, and none of them are
"pronounceable" until they have been well-trodden, that is, until i have
reached the next step, which i can sometimes not immediately trace.

sandra g. says she sees "th""us", and perhaps it is just some brain damage
in my mind that makes me wait to accumulate sound.  i seem to need to find
a whole word, as one might find an ideogram, before being able to "name"
(pronounce/recognize) it.

feel encouraged to comment.  i like thinking.

Subject:      Atelos 12: Some Vague Wife by Kathy Lou Schultz
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Some Vague Wife
by Kathy Lou Schultz

        Atelos (www.atelos.org/) is pleased to announce the publication on June 15,
2002 of Some Vague Wife by Kathy Lou Schultz.

About the book:
        Some Vague Wife, Kathy Lou Schultz’s third published volume of writing, was
written specifically for Atelos and with Atelos’s stated interest in
“crossing traditional genre boundaries” in mind. Ostensibly divided into
three sections and three genres (“Songs,” “Stories,” and “A Novel”), the
overall composition of Some Vague Wife in fact brings about a convergence,
though one that is more disrupted than a fugue, and certainly less
“classical.” Perhaps what’s compositionally at work is achieved through
decomposition — of body into love, of sentence into energy. “If I put my
finger in your ear the sounds emanating from your head indicate signs of
life.”

About the author:
        Kathy Lou Schultz was born in Burke, South Dakota in 1966. She grew up in
central Nebraska, which she left when she was 18 in order to attend Columbia
University. She completed her undergraduate degree at Oberlin College, a
first-generation college graduate, and went on to San Francisco State
University, where she received an MFA in poetry and American literature. Her
first collection of poems, Re dress, won the Michael Rubin Award from San
Francisco State University and was published as The 1994 San Francisco State
University Chapbook. Robert Glück has said of Kathy Lou Schultz’s work,
“Schultz writes about love, work, and physical life in a time when hope is
qualified and nothing is normal.” And Myung Mi Kim has remarked that Schultz
’s work allows “restraint and freedom to coincide in the work of pressing
the problematic of sexual and class identity, reconfiguring woman as an open
book.” Kathy Lou Schultz’s poetry, experimental fiction, and critical essays
have appeared in a variety of influential journals, and her second
collection of poetry, Genealogy, was published in 1999. She is currently
pursuing doctoral studies in literature at the University of Pennsylvania,
where she also co-edits the literary magazine Lipstick Eleven. “I build a
city on imagination,” says Schultz. “Next door, an empire.”

About the project:
        Atelos was founded in 1995 as a project of Hip’s Road. It is devoted to
publishing, under the sign of poetry, writing which challenges the
conventional definitions of poetry, since such definitions have tended to
isolate poetry from intellectual life, arrest its development, and curtail
its impact. All the works published as part of the Atelos project are
commissioned specifically for it, and each is involved in some way with
crossing traditional genre boundaries, including, for example, those that
would separate theory from practice, poetry from prose, essay from drama,
the visual image from the verbal, the literary from the non-literary, and so
forth. The Atelos project when complete will consist of 50 volumes; Some
Vague Wife is volume 12. The project directors and editors are Lyn Hejinian
and Travis Ortiz; the director for production and design is Travis Ortiz;
cover production and design is by Ree Katrak.

Ravi -- Obviously the most visible & essential ME poet right now would be
Mahmood Darwish, the Palestinian poet. Available is a selection of poems,
_The Adam of Two Edens," Jusoor & Syracuse University Press (2000) &
possibly still available, his prose memoir of Beirut under fire in 1982,
called _Memory of Forgetfulness_ (U of California Press). UCP is also
preparing a largish volume of poetry that should be out this fall.
        Two of the major figures of the "Shi'ir" or "Tammuzi" movement have books
available in english: Adonis, "The Pages of Day & Night" (trans. Samuel
Hazo) The Marlboto Press, Vermont 1994) ((plus a volume of important essays
that would situate Arab Modernism, that I can't locate right now...). Then
there are 2 books available by Muhammed Al-Maghut: _Joy is Not My
Profession: Selected Poems_ and _Fan of Swords_.
        For a quick intro to that group you could also look at _Poems of the
Millennium_ Vol. 2 where we have a section on the Tammuzi poets, p 181ff.
        Two anthos, tho I don't know if they are still in print: _When the Words
Burn: An anthology of modern Arabic Poetry 1945-1987_ by John Mikhail Asfour
is a very good intro. _A Crack in the Wall: New Arab Poetry_ edited by
Margaret Obank & Samuel Shimon_ published by Saqi books in London, GB, is an
interestinmg compilationm of very recent Arab work, mainly from the middle
East. Obank & Shimon also edit a very useful magazine from London, called
_Banipal: Magazine of Modern Arab Literature_, maybe the widest rasnging
English language periodical on the contemporary poetry scenes in the Arab
World, both Mashreq and Maghreb.
        Hope that helps,

Pierre

Jessica,

I get it. Vernon's comments helped too. I think "topology" is like a
tee-shirt I still have from college-- pretty stretched out, but it has a
cool logo on it, so I still wear it to cookouts.

You are too kind, and you're right about what a manifesto is.  Thanks for
being gracious with my questions.

Also, it makes me happy that you called me 'dear'.  David Hess never calls
me dear.  Neither does Lawrence Upton. Damnit if we all couldn't be a little
more polite.  Actually, if this photograph isn't airbrushed or something  --
http://www.rpj.org/artists.html -- you can call me 'dear' all you want; i've
been a fan a long time.

Gotta run,
Aaron

this is for people who might want to see what my manifesto ends up
manifesting itself -as-.

but people who are bored with this line of emails can ignore it.  it's
sometimes hard to handle so many emails from poetics, esp. people sneding
all kinds of poetry.  but if you're interested,

http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jss13/poetry/birds.pdf

i'm not happy w/the mandelbrot quote but otherwise...

what i mean basically by topology is that... it's historically altered
physical space.  and i mean to envelope topography, by which i mean the
space as it exists experientally.  i'm not necessarily using these terms
correctly :) but i was advised (by ming-qian ma) to use "topology."  so you
can argue with my wording if you want... as i said b/f, a manifest toe is a
beginning point, an utmost extention of starting-from, a best foot forward.

I was browsing an interesting book the other day: _"Peaks of Yemen I
Summon": Poetry as Cultural Practice in a North Yemeni Tribe_, by Steven
Caton.  It includes a fair amount of poetry in translation, I seem to
recall.  Don't know how useful or relevant it is for your purposes, but
worth checking out.

I think the prose UC book is (as I mentioned before)
brilliant. Agha Shahid Ali also translated a long
Darwish poem that is included in his most recent book
"Rooms Are Never Finished." Etal Adnan also has a book
called "There" (is it Post Apollo Press) which is
really amazing.

Depending on how far back you want to go and if you're
considering other parts of the Arab world, there's a
city lights anthology called "poems of arab andalusia"
that's pretty sexy...

Postings like this one are so interesting rhetorically --
their messages have very little to do with their ostensible
subjects. I have trouble believing that Mr. Derek R
actually cares about responsible posting and archiving
protocols. He seems rather more interested in rubbing
people's faces in their own crapulence. But if Mr. R truly
wants to see a change, a spoonful of sugar couldn't hurt.
Might I suggest "witty, good-looking narcissistic ego-happy
masturbators"?

I for one wouldn't mind being labeled a narcissistic
ego-happy masturbator, but when somebody starts hurling
epithets like "typical American," well, sir, that's going
too far. (Oh no, now I'll have Leonard B on my ass. I guess

I'm not sure what or who you are referring to here, Robin.

    ... I'm sorry, this is layered, and i simply tagged my comment onto the
nearest message.

Leave aside the flapdoodle of let's-all-be-nice (a generic whine).

    ... there is a problem with being a Brit lurking on an American list.

You say Billy Collins, we say Andrew Motion.

So there is a +real+ problem (for me) with BufPo -- the idiom is strange and
the geography is eccentric:  Come hear Anne Waldman read in Downtown New
York.

Who?  Where?  LangPo, wha | zat?

Huh ... ?

"If you care to put your comments in context, I'm sure myself and others
would be happy to understand just what the hell you are trying to say..."

Well, to be honest, that's a decent question that deserves a decent answer.

So.

No answer.

"Nah, forget it. Let's just keep trying to second-guess each other, and
build our discourse on a heap of missed connections. Makes it so much
easier to maintain the status-quo."

But toss the nickle and see which side it lands -- I'm an alien here, but i
+do+ know a bit of the background. I +do+ know who was Bounced From Buffalo
in 98.

The sequence the order the names.

You want specifics?  I'll give you specifics till your teeth turn blue.

{Look, sorry, much of the gringe&fury of this is simply that the Buffalo
Poetics List -- which is +supposed+ to be the great-gran'-daddy Of All
Poetry Lists, can come over as a bunch of mud-puppies wallowing around in a
really small and +parochial+ swamp-pool.

Frankly, I'm disappointed.}

Sometimes, I just sadly twiddle my fingers and toss an occasional possum
into the pond.

Sorry if this doesn't make sense.

Not everything in black and white makes sense.

though this :ist "can only" accomodate a certain "poetic (and hence
inevitable (political and all the other itical) drifts: however, other
objections to "The Gang of Four" were that they were "not nice" ..ok maybe
they are stridently ant-lanpo (or are tey I dont know) but when Ilooked back
to the poets of that time the reasons for censoring (censorship - I might
agree on certain "extreme" cases: it wouldnt be good to have personal
attacks but general political discussion always gets emotive ... we cant
always be passionless as Mr Brink seems to be wanting that chap Tyler to be!
(I dont know him but I do know a Mr Taylor)  is almost always bad and would
in fact contradict Bernsteinian poetics)... I feel we should let on those
who are intereested in poetics: evem in the "bernsteinian school so to speak
there are huge differences which is exactly what is good about his
theoretics...as long as people come back to some coherent and fairly
reasonable discussion: in short, let them on, if they are crazed formalists
or flame everyone incessantly then, sure, we can then see if they bneed to
be booted off. I expect to get flamed:but I can take it like a person. I'm
getting a bit charred by Monsieur Brinkmann ( but ok I know I shoot me mouth
off, but I care: I thnk monsieur Brink is a bit of a RW- possibly a strong
right winger, bu maybe I;m wrong: anycase he has a right to attack as I
attacked...but the attack, sure, should move away from rhetoric (if / and as
much as possible): however when I "attacked" Israel and the US I was honest
to how I FELT at that time .... but I wasnt attacking Aaron: just
disagreeing and I dont think that worries Aaron whom I respect.But I think
that the Gang of Four should be allowed back to see what they say and so on.
It might do us all good. Richard.

A conflation of institutions
(if not, alas, a confederacy of dunces)?

Which came first? SUNY-Buffalo or "the Language school"?
Or, when getting into a bicycle accident at the corner
of Flatbush and 4th Avenue, should we ask which came first,
Flatbush or 4th Avenue?

I heard about this list first from Don Byrd....
it therefore stems issues from his story,
or the story of SUNY-ALBANY,
the less poetry-funded "cousin" of SUNY-Buffalo--

and Creeley was at SUNYAB before
and through Creeley in 85 first heard I of Lang.PO....
thus LANG PO stemmed from Buffalo
in logic no more faux than yours

Or maybe this listserv ISSUES from the threatened cuts to
the SUNY system by then Governor-elect
GEORGE PATAKI? (could be traced....)

(and why are the Buffalo Bills the only football team
not to have their name represented on their helmets?)

Maybe sunyab changed langpo through the agency
of bernstein, or had sunyab hired someone other than bernstein
it would have found another agent to do the listserv thing....

not really about "priority" though...
and maybe kasey could write a "what is suny-buffalo" piece?

one almost longs for the good old "simpler" times
when a visiting professor at Temple University (Susan Howe)
could claim in all earnestness that certain other poets
were too "academic"....

and mr. eric r., i'm going to excerpt what i'm responding too...
though personally I prefer it when the whole post is posted
because i like seeing a wider context.....

signed,
not me

In addition to what's been mentioned so far--

Raymond Roussel, Selections from Certain of His Books (Atlas Anthology VII),
Atlas Press, 1991

Ron Padgett/Raymond Roussel, Among the Blacks. Avenue B, 1988 (a short piece
by Roussel, trans. by Padgett, and an essay by Padgett with the same title)

I'd guess that both books would be available from Small Press Distribution
(as would the Trevor Winkfield volume)

though i defer to stroffolino on matters poetry, i do not on matters national
football league.

strof's line in his post "Hail Pataki" said:

(and why are the Buffalo Bills the only football team
not to have their name represented on their helmets?)

the word "represented" is troublesome here, as if your name is bills and you have
a bill on your helmet, that does seem appropriate, no? perhaps he meant not
having their names on their helmets, which is something many teams don't have.

as ever,

writes Chris, ever the gadfly.

well, I lived in Buffalo briefly in 1970 (on Agaziz Circle by the park) tho
the poets I knew there then did not include Creeley, but John Logan and
Robert Hass. The Howe sisters spent part of their childhoods there. The
submission that got my mag Tottels going later that year came from David
Gitin, who had been an undergrad student of Olson's at UB in the 1960s.

If you're going to put together a conspiracy theory, you should try to
maximize the number of suspects you put on the grassy knoll, Chris.

For me the sound is as important as where the characters appear on the page.
Like Elizabeth, I value them equally. In reading your work I find that I'm
always trying to pronounce the phoneme in my head while waiting for others
to connect with it. Naturally, it sounds different during the process than
the word it settles into. Perhaps our minds work differently, but I'm
hearing as much as I'm seeing when I write or read. Maybe "by ear, he sd" is
not literally about the ear but about using the senses in general as a
guide.

I'm glad you like to think. So do I. It's a very rewarding activity. But be
careful: I'm sure there's an FDA study somewhere that says thinking can
cause Cancer in laboratory animals. :)

Marsh Hawk Press takes its name from the strong, independent, wide-ranging
bird found everywhere in America's open spaces, and not too close to solid,
built-up ground.  Our books present forms and sensibilities that have
assimilated modern and post-modern traditions but expand from these without
political or aesthetic bias, outside of "schools" yet with affinities to the
visual arts.  Making use of the most up-to-date technology, we aim to
produce handsome, affordable books to sustain readers of poetry.  Five
volumes will appear in 2001-2002 with at least five to follow in the next
year.

Books forthcoming by: Burt Kimmelman, Stephen Paul Miller, Sharon Dolin,
Edward Foster, Harriet Zinnes, Basil King, Eileen Tabios, Patricia Carlin,
Martha King, Rochelle Ratner, Madeline Tiger, and Chard deNiord.

Here's a tip:

All email clients, even web mail, have always allowed you to sort your
messages by *subject*

(Click on the header of the column you want sorted)

If your are handicap in some way or 'just can't deal with
computer-stuff' don't worry about it. Nobody is going to sweat the
little stuff. I'm assuming tho, this doesn't mean most people.

Email management, however, is pretty easy, meaning it shouldn't be
necessary for particular objects to contain (be) every other object
(like a blind post).

Subject:      phenomenology of approach (the work so far iii)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

(the work so far iii)


    phenomenology of approach


    = categories for projected text =
    = approaching the everglades, the city, illness, language, culture =

     1  domain limited or unlimited
a limited domain is inscribed with or without fuzzy boundaries. domains
may be limited in sememe, space, and/or time. example: everglades bounded
by hydrology, ecosystem.
     2  clues and cues from immemorial past
a clue is an interpretable symptom, according to a scheme based on an
articulated methodology. a cue is the activation of a scheme based on an
anomaly or repetitive structure within the domain. the domain in turn may
be defined by clues and cues.
     3  difference between clues and cues
a clue is based on evidence from the past to the present; a cue is based
on activation within the present.
     4  relevance theory and approach
clues and cues are such by virtue of relevance; theoretical methodology is
part of a critical sifting apparatus.
     5  top-down classification schema
this follows for example category theory, chaos/fractal theories; one
always already begins with pre-theoretic presuppositions.
     6  wonder, innovation, contradictions
beginning with a sense of awe - everything signs everything, everything
inscribes. innovation in terms of heuristic projections and introjections
- contradictions in terms of anomalies, revisions, recuperations, returns.
     7  deep ecologies, interstitial
the ecologies become perceptually deeper; gaps are filled in; one lives in
depth in the glades, aware of cyclical time, anomalous events, local
histories, individual plants and animals.
     8  filling in the habitus
from larger to smaller clues and cues - alligators and wading birds to
landbirds and invertebrates for example. as one moves down in scale,
identification becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible.
     9  from anomaly to behaviors
and back again; behavior clusters based on attributes. or from story to
structure, diachrony to synchrony, anecdote to prediction.
    10  sense of occupation and intimacy
inhabitation based on familiarity, familiality.
    11  familiarity, familiality
in the first, equivalence scripts and schemata, universals, typifications;
in the second, identity scripts and experientials, individuations.
    12  maternality
chora and matrix - the inchoate beneath the surface of the subject.
    13  deconstruction of the abject
disarticulation of the abject as such and rearticulation in terms of
microstructure, skein. the muck and clutter in relation to marl/peat moss
and biome or flora/fauna regimes. muck and clutter as regimes.
    14  phenomenology of naming
following the notion of rigid designators, beginning with classification,
classification experience, virtual subjectivity and its relation to
concrete manifestation.
    15  inarticulate inchoate
maternality: see above. the proffering of languaging or template.
    16  the mess and its overcoming
entanglement as regime intrusions, conflicting biomes, collapse or
implosion, niche-construction, problems of scale in space and time.
    17  phenomenology of touch
demarcation of environment on the body - thicket tangle, poisonwood,
against the skin. differentiation of the mass.
    18  reinscription of domain
the domain _as_ continually inscribed in negotiation. linguistic contract
of the subject. increasingly fuzzy boundary issues. refinement of
differentiations - typology to decreasing tolerances.
    19  immersive and definable structures
definable is fully reversible; immersive is fuzzy, vectored. both are
capable of meta-level collocations, i.e. a definable of definable,
immersive of definable, etc.
    20  clue skeins
clues related theoretically, taxonomically, in terms of typifications,
taxonomies - heuristic skeins, established on the run.
    21  the instrumental reason of flows and part-objects
fluid mechanics, turbulence, stases within the flow - non-equilibrium
thermodynamics. the partitioninig, parcelling, clutter, of the world.
part-objects as modules: modules 'on the part of' the subject, and modules
'defined as such' within the continually reinscribed domain.
    22  gestural logics and superimpositions
such that partial information (as in land's experiments re: color vision)
extends across a total domain or spectrum.
    23  delaying conclusions and the settling-in of elements
inconclusivity of discourses which are increasingly refined. elements
noticed and defined 'settle in' - in the sense of familiarity - always
with default tags - i.e. elimination by counterexample. retention of _weak
theory_ - searching for coherency without retention of apparently outmoded
paradigms.
    24  continuous processing and absorption of anomalies
anomalies as generative of domain boundaries, entities, temporary
inscriptions, potential of part-objects, etc. the anomaly as the mis-fit
among the accountable and accounted-for. as unaccountable, uncounted, the
anomaly generates circumscriptions, circumlocutions; these are involved by
the subject in a consideration and absorption of the _detour._ every
anomaly potentially turns everything around, and is turned around by
everything.
    25  modes of approach in space and time
diachronic/synchronic approaches - space-time slices. diffusion of
occluded layerings (bay bottoms versus onshore mangrove island
topography). architectonics of the domain.
    26  horizons of 'natural' and 'unnatural' worlds
and horizons of 'subjective' and 'objective' worlds - in relation to
heuristics and experiential structures (immersivities). definition is both
tool and violation; mobile fuzzy domain boundaries participate in the
natural (i.e. given) order as well as ideological political/economic
conscious and unconscious considerations.
    27  weakening of perceptual structures and responses
approach is always already self-critical, self-critique; the critique
itself is withdrawn from the self, sublimated into emergent considerations
of the domain. the phenomenology of approach implies a weakness of
language, definition, inscription, boundary, instrumental reason; it
implies releasement, waiting (not waiting-upon) as well.
    28  releasement and listening
to listen without consideration of the source, the speech, one's answer;
to avoid pausological structures ('yes, but...'); to speak after (what
appears to be) the case.
    29  buildings, dwellings, and habitations
    30  the neighborhood
    31  intersecting populations and worlds
    32  phenomenology of withdrawal
    33  the skein (skew-orthogonal)
    34  the skein (askew and local)
    35  increasing audacity and circumscription
    36  the report
    37  the distribution
    38  the thinking of it
    39  the world of it

The risk of drowning is both metaphoric and real - there are signature
souvenirs from the Everglades - "I gave my blood in the Everglades" - in
some of my photography, I've teetered or approached alligators/biting
snakes/etc. at close range -

But then drowning also connects with emergence/submergence - with sublim-

One of the rangers described Everglades visitors as down 30% since the 70s
- whereas every other park is growing fast. This is because there, I
think, there are no demarcations - drive around, focus on the larger birds
and alligators, leave. She described the park as "layered" - identifica-
tion in terms of the object increasingly magnifies; if we had stayed, we
would have gone to microscopy. There is also the problematic of identity
within the entanglement, which is also the problematic of post-modern
identities, looped, eviscerated in terms of public/private, and caught in
the matrices of what I called "radiations" or (Cantor) dusts - computer,
telephone, radio/tv transmission, inter and intranettings, hackings, and
so forth - not to mention the problematic of _what_ is caught as such -
after Lacan / Foucault, we can't go back to the monolith of the unitary
subject, monad, etc. -

> And is this projected for a book?

If I'm given the time/space to work on such - the problem is my usual
instabilities in terms of income and the stress this produces. Certainly
my thoughts for years have revolved around the issues of consciousness and
intermediations in relation to formal systems - and what happens when
these systems are chaotic, ungrounded, tangled, confused, fuzzy, etc. -

For me the sound is as important as where the characters appear on the page.
Like Elizabeth, I value them equally. In reading your work I find that I'm
always trying to pronounce the phoneme in my head while waiting for others
to connect with it. Naturally, it sounds different during the process than
the word it settles into. Perhaps our minds work differently, but I'm
hearing as much as I'm seeing when I write or read. Maybe "by ear, he sd" is
not literally about the ear but about using the senses in general as a
guide.

and now i write:
I think you're actually agreeing w/me with regards to sound being 2ndary to
site, although perhaps we're coming at it from different directions.  first,
if "it sounds th different during the process than the word it settles
into," then sound is secondary to sight... in that you have the whole word
first before you know the "true" or relevant sounds of its parts.  second, i
don't really "buy" that that's the way reading works--that you sound out a
phoneme (which phoneme do you pick?  if you see "y" do you think, "why" or
"eee" or "eye", for example?)--although I recently read a study about
elementary education that says that boys learn to read more slowly than
girls because the standard method for teaching reading is phoneme-based
("sound out the word") where boys are more likely to learn words spatially
("cat" sounds a certain way and every time you see that image, "cat" you
think "c-a-t" but you would learn a longer word, like "spatially," the same
way, through an s image recognition rather than through sounding out
"sp-ey-sh-ee-al-lee")... so maybe you're right, and it's relative.

but
i think that in nonlinear, or multilinear, writing, if we take this as a
starting point ("sound is secondary to sight") becomes very interesting, b/c
if we dismiss the idea that a phoneme needs to be immediately pronounceable,
then there's no reason to line them up.  as i said earlier, these thoughts
came from being disturbed that spreading letters out on a page lead to a
delay in pronunciation... when, if the letters are spread so far and
non-linearly that the word isn't recognizeable w/o considerable searching i
efforts, and if the letters can be used multipully (multiply... multi-ply...
um...) in more than one scattered word... then there's not a "delay" in the
pronunciation... the pronunciation doesn't just get slower like
"th----------------iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssssss", it actually doesn't
happen at all until one's found all the letters.  there's an example in this
text, but for a better example, try page 10 on this site:

http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jss13/poetry/evolocution.pdf

if there's a more pronounceable fragment and things are close together (as
in the line "plac/e" which is also at the same time the line "plac/ate"),
then it's more readily pronounceable, and meaning and site and listening
happen concurrently... they're close enough together that you can assimilate
all the sounds, sights, and meanings at once, in a tiny explosion of
recognition.  but scrolling down to page 10, what can you do?  it's not
just... typewriter art.  right?  because the system of the previous 9 pages
has told you that there are indeed words with meaning, but the explosion
here can't hold to the same reading/reasoning standards that the previous 9
pages have at least sometimes allowed.  do you really tromp around the page
saying to yourself, "fuh fuh fuh" "ey ey ey" "tuh-tuh-tuh".  i wrote this a
long time ago so i don't remember what the words were, and i find myself
looking at it until i see pronounceable elements, such as "diew" or "bod"
that... aren't words.

one thing that interests me about this conversation is why no one has
trouble with the idea of meaning being secondary to sight, but the idea of
sound being secondary to sight gets a lot of disapproval.  i'm wondering
what kind of western-eye-z'd version of reality we're creating here...
because surely ideogrammatic thinkers would think that a meaning 2ndary to
sight is impossible.  what happens pre-reading... what about pre-reading
cognition can we play with post-poetry...

Hark to what follows, listservents! The bitter fruit of negation is
sometimes sweet to eat – even here, in our midst. With pluck, pluck, O pluck
the bitter fruit, taste! I.e., boring long email follows...


1. "It's All a Tissue of Tears": The Issue of Historical Issue

a. That even one person has been ejected from this listserv by the
moderators is far from just an "academic" matter. But Chris suggests that
that's all it is, as he equates my linking the question of historical issue
to this other question of listserv ejection.

b. Historical issue is only *purely* an academic matter for poets who do not
read books. I don't know any such poets. Do you?

c. Even those who espouse a form of radical forgetting premised on extreme
individualism have to make their claims on the basis of historical issue and
issues (individualism, US populist demagoguery, over-fondness for Pound
while blind to Pound's own historical issue -- the very substance of the
Cantos: Fascism).

d. Fortunately, in writing to this listserv, there are other ways of
articulating a processual strategy of radical memory-loss. Witness the
recent pop fun ("fun"? uh...something, anyway) posts on What Is Language
Poetry.


2. "Where's my Hanky?" The Issue of Historical Issue, First Example

a. Kent Johnson (one of the ejected) is always-already leaping to the
question of his own historical issue -- and especially when he is
speculating on reasons for his ejection. Wouldn't this be anyone's response?

b. A specific "historical issue" could be said to condition Kent's poetics
of heteronomy, not just some part of it on certain occasions (when he posts
under his own name on a poetry listserv, for example). Those who know Kent's
work better than I need to correct me. But if you read Kent's poems at
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/david.bircumshaw/ChideTwo/SecondChiding.htm#KJ)
and his interview at http://www.poetics.yorku.ca/index.php?menu=1 and his
email forwarded by David Hess on Mon, 29 Apr 2002 01:27:25 EDT ("FWD: A
Peace Proposal?"), for example, you will quickly have an impression about
Kent's self-understanding of historical issue.

c. Kent deliberately places himself in close proximity to the idea of
Language Poetry. There is a desire for proximity, it seems, because he wants
to attempt a transgressive break with the idea of Language Poetry as a
dominant form of expression. But, at the same time, there is a desire for
proximity, because he too wants to position himself *in* the idea of
Language Poetry -- as the sole poet who has remained most true to a founding
"first principle" of that poetry so-called school (according to one
reading), namely critique of author-function.

d. Kent seems to conflate his own personal gripes about Language poets and
poetry, with his more-encompassing and theoretical concerns about
author-function. The result, however, is to regrettably undermine
credibility for his critique of Language Poetry's direction since the heyday
of author-function critique, since Kent's critique reads -- to me, at any
rate -- like it is founded not on an appeal to the apparent purity of an
inaugural ideal of the idea of Language Poetry, but rather on an appeal to
something quite the opposite, something inside and not outside, something in
the present and not in the past, something the furthest from "pure," namely,
his own personal gripes.

e. Is Kent unique in keeping a few tissues in reserve for his historical
issues? He is "unique" only in the specific character of that issue, but not
in the fact of it. He is specific, in his own way, in the degree to which he
admits the fact of historical issue into his work. These terms by which to
consider "uniqueness" (or rather, historical idiosyncrasy) vis a vis
historical issue would apply to anyone. A completely objective assessment by
anyone of his or her historical issue is an outright impossibility, if not
an outright false goal (either way, objectivity will always be precariously
perched against "conatus" -- self-interest).

f. But sometimes it helps to try and imagine things as best one can in an
objective "light." If one accepts the above reading of Kent's work, one
might well ask, for instance: Why is Kent appealing so strongly to get back
on this list, and just now, when posts about the idea of Language Poetry
have begun to flourish once again? I would say it is because he needs to
continually tie his work to the idea of Language Poetry. I wouldn't want to
reduce Kent's personal gripes with Language poets and poetry, and/or his
theoretical concerns about the legal status of the author-function in
Language Poetry (conflated as these two issues may appear to be), to
*merely* an academic matter that has no bearing whatsoever for this list.


3. "Lighter Fluid -- I Agree!" The Issue of Historical Issue, Second Example

a. A whole essay could be written on how certain poets have chosen to
aggressively mock and diss, while at the same time sycophantically identify
with and enthusiastically embrace -- for poetic self-furthering -- the idea
of Language Poetry. Gabriel Gudding is for me a convenient second example
here, because he also happens to be one of the ejected. I could have chosen
a number of other poets -- but, I'll try my best with Gudding, given this
context of the ejections, into which I am pressed. I'm especially thinking
of Gudding's poem, "A Defense of Poetry" at
http://www.wildhoneypress.com/Audio/defense.html. "A Defense of Poetry" has
an epigraph by Charles Bernstein, that, along with Gudding's title, together
curiously do not connect to the body of the poem, except in the most
arbitrary way...raising an obvious question: How does one account for this
arbitrariness? My answer is in the terms I am setting out here. The quality
of arbitrariness in his poem is index of an internally, violently
conflicted, unworked-out response to the idea of Language Poetry -- as
follows.

b. Stylistically, Gudding's poem resembles someone like a Richard Brautigan,
but the heroism of Hemingway's classical American-outlaw good-looks sentence
(subject, verb, object -- "what more do you want, and preferably as just
three words per sentence!?") -- already tempered by Brautigan's and
Vonnegut's sense of humor and absurdity -- now takes expressive form in
Gudding's, and our 90s-era, extreme ressentiment. The ressentiment is
moreover stylistically cloaked, in this poem, in a sentimental appeal to the
idea / figure of Christopher Smart. I'm suggesting the body of Gudding's
poem, like the poetry of many others, is really about extreme defensive
posturing due to a sort of 90s ressentiment. But is this sufficent to
account for title and epigraph? No. There's more to it. Because theory has
often, of late, been used as a defensive ground for poetry (the defensive
ground in someone like Brautigan's work is not theory, but something like a
"mood" stylistically lifted off the air of the alternative culture of his
time), there is a sense in which Gudding *needs* Bernstein. The crux,
however, is that "need" itself, as a value for Gudding’s poem, must be
outright rejected by the poem, so it can stay in the freakish and merciless
grip of extreme 90s ressentiment. One wonders, that is, whether Bernstein is
not merely arbitrarily chosen to represent the defensive posture of poetry,
that, in other words, Bernstein and the idea of Language Poetry are mere
toys of convenience, to hit at and hit with -- for it is Bernstein who has
specifically and most famously, and most recently (to my knowledge), invoked
this genre of the poetic defense, in his own poem of the same name, "A
Defense of Poetry." It gets even more torqued than this. The fact that the
choice of Bernstein and of the idea of Language Poetry are merely arbitrary
ones of self-interested convenience, for Gudding, would no doubt rankle any
poet with any sense of the slightest integrity and seriousness -- even
Gudding, I'd wager. But the arbitrary, insofar as it can admit to
self-interested need at all, is a flimsy excuse of a poetic rationale for a
poem. This seeming flaw – the disparity between title, epigraph, and body of
poem -- can only be hidden by means of the faint hope, itself nihilistic,
that nihilism is entertaining. I ask you to look at list records: is
nihilism (if that's the word) entertaining?

c. Gudding's poem is exemplary, in this respect, as I'm suggesting, of an
internal conflict that one can locate in the works of a number of poets (in
their poems, on this listserv, in reviews, etc) who have lost any sense of
the immanent, utopic, social critique out of which Language poets themselves
historically issue. The question of historical issue itself has been elided
from the field.

d. But "internal" (ie between socially invested forces) conflict can be a
sign of working-out questions of historical issue, in some other poets'
work, taking form as a reflexive admission that social critique, the idea of
the social itself, seems lost from the present horizon.


3. Poetic Responses to the Idea of Language Poetry

a. A whole book could be written on responses by poets to the Idea of
Language Poetry.


4. Chris Stroffolino's Response to the Idea of Language Poetry

a. Chris's own response to the idea of Language Poetry is, in Juliana
Spahr's words from her blurb to *Spin Cycle*, "shaped by interest and desire
rather than argument." It can make a reader feel tres sympatique towards the
humane quirkiness of some of his views. This is because, as Chris will
likely be the first to admit, a dominant historical issue for this poet is,
in the shorthand of someone like Altieri, the (fate of the) poetics of
expressivity in relation to the idea of Language Poetry. But "expressivity"
is too generically philosophical, could apply to many poets, so let me give
an example of what I mean.

b. Almost the first idea that Chris considers to be an important and useful
thing to wonder about, in reviewing Watten's "Bride of the Assembly Line"
essay in *Spin Cycle* (thanks, by the way, Chris, for sending -- I just got
it!), is whether Watten (and I guess Stein and Henry Ford, too, and by
implication, the whole of American modernism?) is recommending to Chris that
he buy himself a car. If there was not a certain expressive pathos coming
through in the way that Chris writes an essay, if there was not a focus on
desire and interest, naïve as it might be to the more jaded reader, this
decision to ask such a question of Watten's text would seem really at odds.
But, what can it tell us? It tells us that Chris's central poetic response
to the idea of Language Poetry is to try and identify with it, with *any* of
it, with *something to do with it*, as a poet himself.

c. Chris (I'll direct this part to you; it feels more open-ended), you seem
to suggest a "steady-state" theory of the world, where "priority," your
word, is never an issue, where, as you speculate, anyone could have started
this listserv, and the end-results would have been identical. I can't think
of anything more debilitating than to hold such a theory of poetic (and
other) influences in relation to historical issue.

d. There's something steady-state, or timeless, about the listserv, isn't
there? A steady-state theory does allow anyone to occupy the position of
"firstness" on this list. All history and questions of personal, poetic and
institutional influence and relation, can get tossed off as the academic
foolery of chicken-and-egg questions, since the only self-assertion that
needs to be made is: Look, everybody, I'm eating the egg! I'm eating the
chicken now! It's never who came first, but who eats the email first -- and
look! I'm the first one, here, now, to eat this chicken and egg! Here's me
arng arng arng eating! The "I'm first" impulse has produced some of the best
responses and is an integral feature of the listserv as a medium.

e. And actually, in all seriousness, a chicken-and-egg dialectic is a great
figure to describe what is best about Chris's poetry. It is that figure that
most handily deflates the pretense of ideas.

f. But there's a problem with the "I'm first" that perhaps a listserv
exacerbates. Like Kent, like Gabriel, Chris too needs to deny exactly what
he most wants to affirm as his own. While dismissing any use in thinking
about historical issue, notice that Chris is very careful (going into quite
some detail) to include himself in the narrative of the idea of Language
Poetry, an inclusion that he wants or even needs to, at the same time, with
the same gallant gesture, dismiss. In fact, I ask you, why isn't *Chris* the
founder of the idea of Language Poetry? It seems to have come into the
ripeness of time when Chris first ate of its succulent sweet fruit in the
lap of his grace, Don Byrd.

g. On my descriptive catalogue of features of listserv as medium of
expression, the fact of instant, personal expression would rank high. This
in itself is new and cannot be wholly accounted for by the poets of
*Legend*, it seems to me. In other words, the listserv medium inherently and
equally lends itself to poetics that are modeled on some idea of the
spontaneous expression of everyday ideology (in Althusser's terms! -- just
for contrast), such as that modeled in a variety of specific ways by the
so-called New York Schools.

h. If Don Byrd isn't now, he certainly used to be on this listserv; same for
Creeley; Howe I don't know, but of course she teaches at SUNY-Buffalo, as
did/does Creeley. All this only reinforces the point concerning historical
issue that I am making, though. So actually, I fail to grasp your point,
Chris. I wouldn't go as far to say, as Ron Silliman suggests, that you are
creating a conspiracy out of all these connections. It's not a "conspiracy"
that Byrd, Creeley, Howe, you, me, all of us, even lurkers, have some link
to if definitely not Buffalo then to SUNY-Buffalo via this listserv, is it?
I don't think we specifically have a right to feel "left out" of anything,
if that's what it comes down to (you from Buffalo, I from the United
States -- ha!); that's far too *provincial* a reaction on our part. In
contrast, some listserv members who don't live in North American might have
grounds to think that this listserv and its implicit poetic history is far
too self-centered on its own self-importance -- and precisely because we
fail to address this medium reflexively in a way that would enable
participation regardless of proximity to the history of Language Poetry. If
there is any conspiracy here, it's one that we have are all victims to --
lack of ability to reflexively consider the listserv as a medium, and, to
enable that, the listserv as a historical issue.


5. Hail, Listservents!

a. If the listserv is indeed considered a time-based project, then there are
implications that come with acknowledging this, and more importantly with
continuing to know this to the point where such knowledge affects how and
what one posts. None of these implications are pleasant and nice,
necessarily. The implications are not pleasant to recount because "pleasant"
would no longer be the status quo affect that the listserv would necessarily
be aspiring to replicate uniformly throughout its temporal continuum of
postings. "Pleasant," as some might be thinking right at this point,
however, is *not* the result of moderators' rules, but rather results from
consciously forgetting those rules -- in the following sense.

b. Listservs have created a dilemma unforeseen and still unacknowledged by
would-be anarchists who champion Thoreauvian "conscience," for example, as
one of their principles upholding the idea of free expression. (Those who
know more on this as it might connect to a listserv idea, fill me in.) There
is an ideology of freedom that assumes that in a truly free space -- the
space that a listserv is "supposed" to embody -- moderators, censors, rules
do not exist, and all structure is transparent -- even mediatory values are
transparent. But, when a listserv becomes the medium of expression, this
ideology no longer applies. With a listserv, it is no longer the case that
each participant is his or her own best moderator -- the very cornerstone
assumption of the idea of conscience, civil disobedience, etc.

c. The concept of "public sphere" established a unique ratio between psyche
and other, out of which developed humanist principles of verbal conduct. One
is hard-pressed to apply these principles to listserv space. A flame, for
instance, is unlike previous forms of hate language, I think. A listserv can
project, more than any medium has done before perhaps, unparalleled
psychical force onto the immediacy of the screen, upsetting the unique
historically handed-down ratios between psyche and other that upheld former
conceptions of public discourse and appropriate conduct. The "natural"
"civilized" balance between psyche and other is forever overturned --
moreover, the standard does not even apply. By any formerly-thought-of-as
"natural" standard, a listserv might be thought to display a series of
psychoses. So, there is no longer a "natural" inhibitory mechanism of
self-control operating on a listserv. But how does one interpret the
consequences, then? Is a listserv a free-for-all? Are there rules?

d. On a listserv, one is subject to, and projected into, not a "free"
psychical space (which would imply that any flame is freely received and
freely given, but obviously this is not the case -- the impact of a flame is
felt, the impulse for writing a flame is felt: they're events) but a
differently ruled space, ruled by an external collectively-determined set of
rules, rather than by an internal, individual impulse called conscience. We
need to adjust for that. An absolutely free space, psychically unbounded by
any preconceptions, or even conceptions, of the other, is itself a fantasy
sometimes expressed on the listserv and induced by the very idea of a
listserv, but such fantasy cannot ever constitute, itself, rules for a
listserv; such fantasy can only ever be a projection from outdated rules,
induced and enabled by the displaced former psychic ratios and virtiginal
distortions of this new collective medium. Even a listserv called Poetry
Flame War, established on an idea of unrelenting absolute freedom, would
engender rules (if extreme forms of expression are any judge, they would be
harsh -- befitting the language).

e. A listserv that is imagined as a specific, time-based project, is not a
free, but a specifically ruled space. Since the "normal" rules of pragmatic
communication no longer necessarily apply -- rules more often than not
assumed by many to establish the first principles of freedom in a public,
communal space -- then other rules must be in play which are specific to the
listserv. That is, there is no The Listserv, but only a series of different
listservs with specific rules enabling the articulation of psych(ot)ical
libidinal energies. Let's say we imagine this listserv activity to be
reflexively exploring, enacting, the listserv as a medium of expression, for
instance. Given the historical issue of this listserv, back into the
avant-gardes and innovative traditions of poetry, it makes sense. Other
listservs might have other emphases. In other words, to state that this
listserv is linked historically to "SUNY-Buffalo" is not to consider
SUNY-Buffalo as the inner circle and as the court of contemporary poetry.
I'd go so far as to say the opposite is true -- that in fact, the major
heresy of influence in the idea of Language Poetry (unlike previous schools)
is that those who have sustained interesting work by taking that influence
and doing the most with it are usually from elsewhere, are in some
fundamental sense not part or privy to the idea of the inner circle. This is
the outward face of the idea of Language Poetry -- the exploration of the
social as such.

f. What I'm finally saying is that we *need* the Ejected Five to remain
excluded from this listserv; they should be that important to us! It is
worthwhile devoting some time to thinking about their work precisely because
they are ejected. They are structurally more significant to this listserv
than many a post on it, insofar as the beginning task of coming to begin to
reflexively understand this listserv as a medium of expression is concerned.
They have opened up to us the possibility of articulating historical issue.
This fact of exclusion binds them only that much more intimately to us here,
and to the potential of a reflexive engagement with the listserv as medium.
That's why I gave them an honored name like The Ejected Four, since I think
a romanticist identity of outsiderdom forms very much a part of their
historical issue and their response to the idea of Language Poetry. It's
hard to be an outsider when you're at the same time -- subscribed. Finally,
as in whew, finally! we have an event that has occurred that can help us
become reflexively aware of how this is a time-based project.

g. Rather than conflating institutions and histories, I'm arguing for a
recognition of their diversity and specificity, in everyone here -- even in
list-space (as to "confederacy of dunces," this listserv has always been
that, Chris -- but, for lord's sake, don't kill yourself over it! as the
author of the novel by that name did; for I think, unlike him, you're I
positive, you get, if not express, a healthy dose of "I'm great"). So chill
on it, fill up on this, and just mind the spills.

Jessica

Let's put it this way: I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you about sound
or sight. I work from a situational aesthetic, not an absolute. I use
whatever works within the context I'm working in. In plain old left-margin
poetry, the question of the primacy of sound or sight could be a toss-up.

In the years when I recited my music with a poetry band, though, I ran
across a conflict between the two. I was reciting the work orally, which
gave speech a situational precedence, yet the text itself was very
"projective" and while its presence all over the page didn't affect the
"message" on one level, in poems in which I used a word like "(e)merge" did
create a tension between speech and sight did "emerge" since the speech form
was dominant in the performing situation but couldn't convey the "sight"
element that gave the poem's meaning a little twist. So, sight did have a
primacy there, but the primacy was lost in the dominant oral context.

For my own work, the sound of the words guides their flow, but my placement
of them on the page will alter their meaning. I consider poetry as making
music with language. The visual spacing is a form of orchestration.  I haven
't done much work with breaking words into phonemes. Just one poem. I think.

I wasn't able to access "evolocuton.pdf" from my computer, so I looked at
"Birds" again. When I read the phonemes I pronounced  them because I
recognized them as filling space on the page and therefore demanded as much
of a  "sounding" as any fully formed word. As I found other phonemes fitting
a word's pattern, I had to modify their pronunciation to conform to the word
they ultimately constituted. Instead of delaying the pronunciation of the
phoneme, I would say that it receives a double pronunciation, as phoneme and
later as par of a word, and that the adjustments of pronunciation become
part of the poem itself. It becomes an added sound texture, not a suspended
one. Its visual texture isn't a matter of debate.

I believe the matter of sound vs. sight is a relative one. In your poem the
visual element obviously receives primacy because the placement of the words
or their phonemes in certain places on the page determines how they will be
read, sounded and interpreted (as well as when they will be sounded and
interpreted). If, in "evocolution," the words explode, I might interpret it
as a "rain" of phonemes and pronounce them separately until I can determine
what words if any the will form. Again, I couldn't access the page. My guess
is that if I could read "evocolution" I would pronounce each phoneme as I
went along, then later re-pronounce all of them as one word with the
corresponding modification of pronunciation I mentioned above.

I'm not sure that the elementary education study you mentioned applies to
me. I was one of the best readers in my class, although my second grade
teacher "demoted" me because instead of holding by book on the desk at a
60-degree angle, I let it slide flat into the desk, a position that felt
more comfortable to me but violated some rule of posture or decorum. In
1950, when I learned to read from the Dick and Jane books, I don't think
phonic teaching had developed. I'm sure the teachers used it, but not to the
degree they did, say, in 1970.

The question of meaning being secondary to sight may have to do with the
nature of the poetry written by many of the poets on this list. Traditional
meaning doesn't have traditional primacy. In a poem whose meanings are
multiple, arbitrary, or a matter involving the reader's engagement with the
text, the matter might be secondary to what we're talking about. on the
other hand, not everybody uses the contemporary extensions of "composition
by field" as it's evolved from the typewriter to the computer screen and
beyond.

So, my take on the situation is that the primacy of speech or sight depends
on the writer, the situation and the work itself. But if you can post
another way to access "evoculution" I'll read it and see if the nature of
the work alters my reading method or my opinion."

UC Press cuts back offerings
By Tim Rutten
Los Angeles Times
4/26/02

University presses, one of the pillars of U.S. intellectual life, are in
trouble, beset by mounting financial losses and an ongoing identity crisis.

The latest victim of this trend is the University of California Press, the
West's most prestigious publisher and, as measured by sales revenues, one
of its largest.

*Out with philosophy*
As part of a general retrenchment, the UC Press will no longer produce
books on philosophy, architecture, archaeology, political science or
geography. It will publish dramatically less literature and far fewer works
of literary theory. Twelve jobs have been eliminated through attrition, and
further job cuts are planned.

``We lost more than $1 million last year,'' said Lynne Withey, acting
director of UC Press.

``In fact, all of the major university presses lost money in the last
fiscal year. Some of us just lost more than others.''

The University of California subsidizes just a little more than 7 percent
of the press's budget. The rest must come from sales revenues, which last
year amounted to $15 million from books and $3 million from journals.

``We can't just trim a little here or cut a little over there anymore. We
need to make changes in the kinds of books we publish.''

To decide what those changes would be, the UC Press enlisted the consulting
company of McKinsey and Co., which offered its help pro bono. The
consultants' recommended that UC follow the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and reduce its list to fields where its sales are strongest.

*Formula for success?*
McKinsey, Withey said, ``came up with a formula under which we will do 80
percent of our business in six fields where we're already strong'' --
history, anthropology, sociology, religion, biology and natural history.

``It was very hard to abandon things like philosophy, which is a core
discipline in the academy,'' Withey said. ``The whole process has been a
series of painful decisions.''

At least one UC scholar was, well, philosophical about the cutbacks.
``Given the reality of the marketplace as a force in our lives, there is
only so much money you can lose,'' said John R. Searle, a philosophy
professor at the University of California-Berkeley.

``Obviously I want more books to be published -- especially, good
philosophy books -- but you can't go on losing money on them forever,''
said Searle.

But another of Berkeley's leading scholars disagrees. ``Even apart from
this cutback, the mandate of university presses has been gravely undermined
over the past few years,'' said Robert Alter, professor of Hebrew and
comparative literature. ``The idea originally was that bringing out serious
works that were a contribution to scholarship, but not viable for a
commercial publisher, was the university press's obligation to the world of
knowledge."

The American Government should pay for philosophy books and lit theory and
so on. They waste billions making military crap. And the "space" thing is a
big fizzler: who cares about whether they go around the world again.Richard.

I wonder if there isn't room for print-on-demand technology in situations
like this one.  I was talking to Chris Hamilton-Emery of Salt Publishing
last week; the reason they keep rolling out new titles of poetry is that
print-on-demand (with its limitations, granted) is very inexpensive, indeed.

Subject:      FW: Fakelanpo.com,
              my new collaborative web site (ie I need help :-)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

In response to the discussion of Language poetry on the Poetics list, I have
created Fakelanpo.com (http://www.sporkworld.org/PN/pn_71/html/index.php --
does anyone know a good cure for ugly URLs --- it's mine, so I can rearrange
things, but I used a program tio build the site and I don't know where it
expects to find things), a community portal for the discussion of Fake
Language Poetry.  You must understand that this site is not entirely serious
in nature...  Actually, it would be cool if it turned into a regular poetry
posting and discussing place, with a light hearted presmise.

(From the introduction to the site: "Fake Langugae poetry is Language Poetry
which is actually fun to read.  The site also covers discussion of
Realangpo, which is Language poetry which is fun to write but not fun to
read.  Then there will hopefully be some Goodlangpo posted there, which is
both fun to read and write, and, alas, Langpo which is neither fun to read
nor to write and which therefore comes into being mysteriously....")

The site is a community portal.  In other words you can join it (for free),
and post articles to it and add comments to the posted articles.  There is
no rule that you join as yourself.  I intend to join as myself (well I had
to to be the admin) and also as various strange characters who comment on
things and post weirdly.

You can post poetry and anything else including (and hopefully) humorous
rude comments.  Please be sure also to vote in the poll for who is your
favorite Language poet.  The poll is one place I made it obvious that there
was something screwy about the site...

I amm interested in filling up the "sections" (they are not immediately
visible) with actual texts, either spoofs of Language poetry, spoofs of
other poetries, or real poetry that is supposed to be good.  Unfortunately,
to add to that part of the site, you need priveleges (ie you need to be me),
so email any submissions to me...  I guess I get to decide if it is a joke
or real :-)

Aside from poetry, where I really need help is is derriving the theoretical
foundations of Fake Lnaguage poetry along with all the learned references I
don't know.  So I would be grateful if people can help me with this!

Finally, this is a work in progress.  I can put anything I like (if I can
write it in PHP (or HTML)) on the site, and it would be easily jazzed up by
some interactive web art, or some vispos if anyone wants to submit one for
the home page.

Print on demand is very useful in  some circumstances, but it wouldn't save
outfits like UC much money. Hrere's the way it works: if I turn out a
thousand copies of a book by the standard method it costs me considerably
less per copy than a shorter run of print on demand. But I'm stuck with
warehousing costs until the books sell. All of the other costs remain the
same: salaries for editors and staff, prepress and typesetting, rights,
advertizing.  Distributors generally take 65% of cover price, and for a
small run like a thousand books other demands of distributors, like
promotional copies, make it more like 75%. Authors get 10% of cover price.
That means that of the $20 one might spend for a book $2 goes to the author
and $15 to the distributor. Out of the remaining $3 comes all operating
expenses. Small presses get around some of this by not paying the one or
two people who work to put the book out, by getting grants (also shrinking,
and onerous to apply for by understaffed presses), by paying authors in
copies, and by foregoing major distributors. But even SPD wants 55%, which
barely allows them to survive. The major presses get around the problems by
having enormous economies of scale--produce enough copies and you approach
the cost of paper per book, and those add-ons by say Consortium that
account for 10% of cover price becomes a fraction of a penny.

This is why academic presses do mass mailings of catalogues--catalogues are
costly, but a direct sale eliminates the distributor's cut (remember that
even if UC sells a book directly to a bookstore the store takes 40-45%, and
there's the growing problem of returns--Amazon now takes 15% plus $.99 for
books they don't warehouse themselves). And why small presses, the kind
that produce most of our poetry, depend on word of mouth and direct sales.

Twenty years ago academic and small presses met their costs through library
sales, with a modest or no discount. Now libraries, whnich have smaller
staffs and tighter budgets, order through wholesalers, who also need a cut
that's large enough so that they can pass a part of it along to their
regular clients. And the libraries order much less.

Here's an actual example. Junction Press's (my imprint) next book will have
an initial run of 2200. It's 432 pages, and it will cost me $7000.00 to
produce. Authors will be paid in copies, which is why there are 200 more
copies than one might expect. There are no slaries to pay.  So each copy
for sale costs me $3.50. Cover price is $25. Every book sold through SPD
will earn $7.75. If I sold through Consortium  it would be $2.75. (the
figures would be more dire still if my press run were smaller) From that
sum deduct all storage and promotional costs. That's great if I sell every
copy, but nobody can plan on that basis unless they publish nothing but
no-risk books, and I don't think either philosophy or poetry qualify.

If there's a solution it's this, and it won't make booksellers happy:
whenever possible buyers, whether libraries or individuals, should buy
directly from presses. And when small presses announce a discount to list
members take it.

Isn't there a size-limit here?  I can print an individual copy of (once the
files are set up) an 80 page A5 (42 lines to the page) perfect-bound
paperback (card covers) for the cost-of-materials. ***  (90 gm A4 paper at
maybe $6 per 500 sheets, toner, PVA glue -- then factor in the covers [10
pence each?] and £67 to buy ten ISBNs.)  I hope I can reach 160 pages before
the system blows.  (I'm about to find out shortly when I try printing
Chide2.) But above that ...

Mind you, this is strictly kitchen technology -- a non-duplex laser printer,
bog-standard Word.7, a steel straight-edge and a tool for scoring.  Definite
+not+ Finely Produced Books, but the end result may be 90-95% comparable to
the output from a commercial small printer.

But there are problems.  Costing doesn't include the cost of the labourer's
time.  (I could be reading a Good Book.)

The maximum word-length (I guess) my "system" could handle would be 80,000
words.

Did anyone mention distribution?  Forget it.

Works fine for what I want to produce, but I doubt it would be feasible for
something like Bradley's _Appearance and Reality_.

(Incidentally, Something similar happened over here UK-side, not that long
ago, when Oxford University Press decided to dump their entire contemporary
poetry list.)

Serials printed:

A Chide's Alphabet, Issue 1 [available]
A Chide's Alphabet, Issue 2 [forthcoming]

*** Incidentally, the time it would take to print a single copy of an 80
page book, where I didn't have any in stock -- from start to finish, thirty
minutes max.  No financial saving in printing more than one (the bottom line
is the cost-of-materials) but the more copies the less (propotionately)
time-per-copy.

Dear Friends, “It’s spring again, I/wonder why?” opined James Schuyler,
and so do we.

One sure sign is naked poets we don’t have, but poetry that speaks true
and bold in the curved ambience of the Bowery Poetry Club we offer.

May Wednesdays are our Supreme Poets, and this (May 8) Wednesday’s
women of the word are especially notable: Mayda del Valle is simply The
Most Supreme of the young poets on the scene, and the reigning National
Slam Champion. To hear her is to understand the energy of the New
Poetry. Joined by Jackie Sheeler’s street tough spirituality, Vicki
Hudspith’s rock’n’roll of irony, and the tectonic  stylings of  Leslie
Duprey and your host: the best MC in the World: Madame Ebony Washington.

And while we feature these Divas du Monde in this Lettre des Nouvelles,
a breathless list to address the moment would begin tonight, Cinco de
Mayo, the Hack Poet! Tuesday Synonymous open workshop (You are the
Critic!! & the poets obey)! followed by Mike Mumz and Beau Show! our
club FLOW follows the Supremes on Wednesdays! UrbanaSlam on Thurs has
The Killer, Jeff McDaniel, as a feature! and Friday we celebrate Emily
XYZ’s 40th Birthday with a rare NYC appearance! that precedes our two-
week residency of the Dada Punk Poetry Puppetry show,

UNCLE JIMMY’S DIRTY BASEMENT!

Drop in and say hello and let the BoPo swing your spring. Spring your
swing.

In addition to his duties as a U.C. professor of philosophy, John Searle
owns many PROPERTIES in the Berkeley area, which he rents out FOR MORE
MONEY THAN HE PAYS FOR THEIR UPKEEP AND MORTGAGE, thereby winning for
himself a tidy PROFIT. I have never lived in any of them, but I understand
them to be in POOR REPAIR. As a result of Professor Searle's successful
1990 LAWSUIT against Berkeley's Rent Stabilization Board, landlords were
allowed to raise rents by 26% IN A SINGLE BOUND. This was known, and is
still remembered, as the SEARLE INCREASE.  Which is why it's kind of FUNNY
and yet FITTING to hear him chalk up U.C. Press's problems to "the reality
of the marketplace," given his notorious role in CONSTRUCTING that
marketplace -- making him a kind of MASTER of the very REALITY with which
he would EXPLAIN AWAY THE SITUATION.

Sorry for all the CAPITAL LETTERS, Robin, but they're KIND OF FUN ONCE YOU

AN AMERICAN AVANT GARDE: SECOND WAVE SYMPOSIUM
July 26-27, 2002, The Ohio State University Libraries

Here is a list of the presentations.  I believe we have been able to
include everyone who applied to present something.  Please let me know
of
any errors, exclusions, questions, as soon as possible.  Also, if you
have
an updated title of your presentation, let me know soon.  Note: this
does
not include a list of people doing brief readings Fri. afternoon; that
will
include pretty much anyone on this list (and a couple others) who can be

there (it  is NOT an "open mic", however!  A couple of folks have said
they
only wanted to read briefly, and they will be able to do so, as will the

other presenters).
Thanks!

Charles;

I remember an interesting discussion I had with Lee Bartlett on this topic.
Specifically, it was with regards to the University of New Mexico Press,
whose director, an ex-bookkeeper, was proud that the press was making money.
He felt that if a university press sells more than 5000 copies of a book it
isn't doing its job. My question was, Why is a non-profit press making a
profit?
It very sad that many of these presses are being made to compete with
commercial presses, and are thus losing their mission, a reflection of most
of the universities themselves, who are no longer educating, but training
students for jobs.

Since these meditations are about language, I hope they are appropriate for
the list.  In any case, feel free to delete or to pass on:

Meditations in a time of delusions and lies  [3]

Words are always slippery, and meanings can be so elusive.  Israel says
"Yes," allowing the United Nations to send a team to investigate death and
devastation in Jenin, but that really means, "Meet my demands," and the UN
accommodates, which then slides into, "You can meet my demands when Hell
freezes over," and the world has managed to diddle for two weeks.  Israel
did say, "Yes," once upon a time, and it was the obstreperous, biased
behavior of the UN that really made that mean, "No" -- right?  Isn't that
clear?  Similarly, President Bush says, "Israel should withdraw from the
West Bank," but that really means, "Keep up the good work, Sharon -- just
don't be so obvious."  After a while, you come to note how words do not
seem to stand still long enough to mean anything any more: just ask a
pro-Israel ideologue what United Nations Resolution 242 means, for example,
and you will discover, perhaps to your surprise, that it does not say
Israel should withdraw from the lands it occupied in 1967, and, in fact,
those lands are not "occupied" but "disputed."  All of this would be
hilarious, except that the whole corruption of language amounts to a
lexicon of blood greater than the Oxford English Dictionary.

So, it takes hard work to unscramble the double-talk, even for commonly
accepted words like "Israel," "Palestine," "peace," and, one of the most
bizarre, "honest broker."  However, I will start with one of my favorites,
"settlements."  Settlements are those housing projects that Israel builds
on Palestinian land occupied since 1967.  I propose that settlements should
henceforth be called "segregated housing projects built on stolen land" (or
"segregated housing," for short) and the people who live in them should be
called "segregationists."  This gives a more adequate picture of the
situation.  Often, they are called "Israeli settlements," which is true,
they are, but that might give you the wrong impression that a Palestinian
who is a citizen of Israel from Nazareth might move into Kiryat Arba.  Uh,
I don't think so.  No, these are "segregated housing projects," and one
type of person is allowed in, the Jewish type, and other types of people
are not.  Americans know about segregation, and although many may even nod
approvingly of ethnic and racial purity to this day, most Americans, and
most American Jews, find this reprehensible  and it took decades, if not
centuries, of social upheavals to make the word as ugly as the practice.

What is truly astonishing is how easy it can be, if you come with the right
credentials, to live in "segregated housing."  Israel is a state of the
entire Jewish people and not a state of its citizens, which means someone
like me, born in Brooklyn, could become a citizen overnight, according to
one "law of return," whereas a Palestinian born in Jaffa cannot, according
to the denial of another "right of return," mainly to protect the Jewish
nature of the Jewish state from getting diluted by too many non-Jews.  As a
consequence, I can move into a "segregated housing project" virtually
overnight, and I can be supported by Israeli government subsidies designed
to make it easier for me to become a segregationist.

But, you know, Israel is a "democracy," the only democracy in the Middle
East, which, of course, raises another choice word.  "Democracy" is a
thorny one -- and the concept is a work in progress, as anyone who voted in
the last American presidential election could tell you.  "Democracy"
requires another discussion, particularly the paradox of so many American
Jews supporting religious rule and segregation in Israel but advocating
church-state separation and pluralism in America.  But in the instance of
"segregated housing projects," "democracy" means "segregationists" have the
right to take land (called "Judea and Samaria"), appropriate water, carry
firearms, lord over non-Jews, and vote for candidates who call for
"transfer" to spirit possible "trespassers" (the original owners of the
land) to Jordan (which is, if you didn't already know, the real
"Palestinian state").

Shouldn't somebody complain to the Federal Housing Administration?

Happiest possible Mondays to all,

Jessica, Interesting you brought up meaning, just what I was thinking about
in trying to get my head round all the sound/sight discussion. For me, what
you are saying about sound, how it lives in this odd sometimes
unrecognizable place for awhile, all the while doing things (by phoneme, by
various), and then comes together at the end -- relates to meaning also in
my opinion. Meaning goes through many stages as one reads or writes a poem.
And it stays that way. It does not necessarily come together in the end. It
remains open and changeable (situational to use Vernon's word) in the
topology of the poem. To me what is satisfying is that the meaning does not
coalesce at the end in to one recognizable thing, as the word th...uu....ss
might. The process, the instability, all that of the topology, to me, play
out constantly through sight, sound, and meaning. To me they are inseparable
in the end.

PS I don't want to just leave it at the cliche "open and changeable,
situational" stance for the role of meaning in the poem's topology. What I
mean, more precisely, is that the complexity of the poem is made of layers
and moments of sight, sound, and meaning in the topology, the microcosm, the
geologic time of the poem.

PPS Has anyone read the book Fashionable Nonsense about how humanities
intellectuals do themselves a disservice by using words from science? What
about the other way round? Anyway, that's another thread....& I haven't read
the book, just looked through it at the store.

SARAH MANGOLD & FRED MOTEN

Winner of the 2001 New Issues Poetry Prize, Sarah Mangold’s first book
Household Mechanics is, “... a disquieting review of indirect disclosures,
internal churnings, and palpable notions, subjected to a tense and
skeletal language” (C.D. Wright).  Born in Omaha, Nebraska and raised in
Oklahoma, Mangold studied at San Francisco State.  She is also the author
of a chapbook, Blood Substitutes (Potes & Poets, 1998), and the editor of
the Seattle-based magazine Bird Dog.

An investigator of geography and language, Fred Moten is the author of the
poetry collection Arkansas  (Pressed Wafer, 2000), which, as Michael
Palmer says, “...reminds us that no vital sense of community can be
separated from its confusions and contentions and its ardent affirmations,
just as no poetry of worth can settle for the easy assuagements of the
given.” Moten teaches in the Department of Performance Studies at the
Tisch School of the Arts, NYU.  His next book, Ensemble & Improvisation:
The Political Erotics of the Black Avant-Garde , is due out from the
University of Minnesota Press.

charles, thanx for that note on u of california... depressing...

my fear is that this will give other university presses an excuse to
follow suit... some are already tottering, as many on this list
know... and as some have suggested here already, it's another of
those public exercises in deciding whether something is worth
pursuing regardless of profit...

but it's bound, in any case, to back-pressure the entire publishing
spectrum, to varying degrees... i happen to be someone who publishes
on small presses and university presses (the trades have become nigh
impossible for the work that i do)... and there are times when i
imagine my writing on these presses as complementary (and i think i
have good reason to imagine so, judging by what i know re respective
readerships)...

anyway, it's a sad day when a major up drops e.g. it's philosophy
line, gosh all mighty... i mean, did they really think they we're
going to make money off of philosophy?...

best,

joe

name magazine

issue 4/5 - fall 2001/spring 2002
now available for public consumption

featuring work by young poets, including
matt chambers
justin audia
christopher fritton
ric royer
jessica smith
eric gelsinger
sandra guerreiro
nick gilewicz

most of these poets are from the philly/buffalo area, which means they have
a unique proximity to NYC, DC and Toronto--the poetry reflects a strange
blend of influences from those regions.  $5 includes: shipping, zine, poetry
trading cards.  $5 is a "suggested donation," which means: send more or
less, pretend it's a sliding scale.  give a bigger tip if you find you like
the magazine.

send $ to: name magazine, c/o Jessica Smith, 537 W Ferry #1, Buffalo, NY

if you would like to submit to name for future editions, be forewarned that
we are highly biased towards the visual side of things, and have about as
much left-aligned work as we can handle (unless you have someone that really
stands out).  send submissions to the address above.  name is a product of
suny/buffalo, but that does not necessarily mean that you will love it or
hate it.  if you like essex or queen street quarterly, you will probably
like name.

eliz. and vernon: i need to drop out of this conversation for awhile,
fascinating as it is.  i have a bunch of final papers to write that are not
being written b/c my brain's pleasantly clogged w/poetry.  thanks for your
reactions to the manifest, and i hope to continue talking about this (maybe
on backchannels?) once the semester's over.

I like this descprition better than what I offered. I didn't intend to dwell
on this aspect of the discussion in great depth, so I chose a word instead
of a paragraph. But you did amplify what I wrote. Thanks.

Not your passion (should have been spirit, of course) or shame--I've also
read more than my share of not very interesting academic productions. It
was  the poor sods who wrote the articles I was referring to.  Look, it's
fairly safe (and not very original) to say that 90% of anything is crap.
What's the percentage of crap if the things in question have an ulterior
motive, our academic selection process?

But don't mind me--I'm grumpy on the subject.

I haven't read Fashionable Nonsense, but I've experienced what you =
describe. To support my writing, I used to work in the human services. =
At the managerial level, administrators mix sociological jargon with =
computer jargon to create a bizarre hybrid that sounds impressive while =
saying nothing. I think it stems from the inadequacy many people in the =
humanities and social sciences feel in relation to the sciences. This =
society values science and its quantifiable nature more than it does the =
humanities and social services and their difficult to quantify nature. I =
think the people I used to work with used the terminology partly to =
impress the legislators who voted to fund their programs and partly to =
make themselves feel they measured up to the "quantifiable world" of =
scientists and administrators in private industry. Most of the people I =
know in the sciences---not a lot--- speak plain English outside the lab. =
They do it to communicate, not to impress themselves or others.=20

PPS Has anyone read the book Fashionable Nonsense about how humanities
intellectuals do themselves a disservice by using words from science? =
What
about the other way round? Anyway, that's another thread....& I haven't =
read
the book, just looked through it at the store.

What blind-reply posters don't seem to (have the intelligence to) grasp,
is that the body potion of your emails are actually end up as the basic
unit known as the web page (i.e. this isn't gopher anymore).

When you post to the poetics list your email ends up as a web page here
-->
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html

If you are replying blindly, you contribute to publishing a trail of
irrelevant garbage and exhaust so that the single basic unit of the web
page is destroyed, since it contains a copy of a whole other page(s).

Therefore the search feature (onsite and web) does not work as intended
-- the message is deliberately shaded from access by the public.

_____________

For instance, Geoffrey Gatza sends an email containing the text "Luffalo
Poetry Sucks," to 2 different lists (plus some others we won't mention
for simplicity):

1.."Imitationpoetics@Topica. Com" <imitationpoetics@topica.com>

2..UB Poetics discussion Group <POETICS@LISTSERV.ACSU.BUFFALO.EDU>


...which immediately creates a searchable web page for both archived
lists...:=20


1..Geoffrey on Imitationpoetics:
http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=3Dfa.o7jfuuv.vi4ajq%40ifi.uio.no&oe=3D=
w
indows-1252&output=3Dgplain

2..Geoffrey on UB Poetics:

1&O=3DD
&F=3D&S=3D&P=3D13989


...which inversely can be found, via search, by all humans on the globe
with an internet connection...:

See >
http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=3Den&q=3D%22Luffalo+Poetry+Sucks


Very good... Instant knowledge creation and reference  -->


... BUT WAIT.. Notice how UB Poetics *does not* appear as a search
result! That's because=20

a) Poetics has not registered with http://google.com

or=20

b) did register and Google rejected you because your members don't know
how to post email to a discussion list.


You see, ideally, posters to this list would have their contributions
web-archived and searchable automatically.

So that, one could, immediately after the post, go to http://google.com
and search for "Luffalo Poetry Sucks" under the 'Groups' tab and get
back an answer.

If anyone here is truly interested in defining terms like 'language
poetry' for instance, this is how you go about it, -- by being a search
result, by being accessible (ie. you answer when someone asks)

What you don't do is make sure *all communication has no hope* of
reaching anyone by blind-posting and other bad habits which obscure.

If you've ever been on a discussion panel in real-life before, you might
want to note how most people don't stand up and reply by repeating
word-for-word what someone else just recently said. Not unless you're a
complete moron!

However, because you are (morons) stuck in the stone-ages and you wish
to be deliberately 'unaware' and 'unconscious' of your environment and
actions, and you choose to be oblivious to the *real* existence of the
archiving of your email to a public searchable web page, if you insist
on going-against-the-grain like some spoiled, crying, infants...
producing a bunch of slop no one would ever want to look through because
it is and appears such a mess...

Well.. Let's just say even the biggest names you can drop will not be
enough to convince http://google.com to crawl your site and turn your
insights into search results. They're not going to even give you a
second glance because your archiving practices (i.e.. your posting
practices) ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE, that is, SUB-STANDARD.

Ok. No biggie. Who ever said anyone on this list ever gave a shit about
anyone but themselves, founders included. If they did, one would assume
they would be aware of the selfishness and conceit which allows posters
to blindly reply when they know exactly what they are referring to but
are too chicken-shit etc to come out and CLEARLY say it.

These are the same people who drive SUV's and support Big Tobacco. They
are completely oblivious to how their actions effect the world and the
people which live in it -- they just don't care. They don't give a shit
about anyone but themselves.=20

I guess most of you feel this list is a one-way, dead-end street, which
doesn't lead anywhere? I hope the above demonstration of where your
email actually goes shows this is not so, and how it can be so much
more, with a tiny effort.

Posters on this list have the opportunity to be an online authority; to
spread their fame and insight across a globally-connected online
community. And how do the members of this list approach that
opportunity? By putting up as many and as much barriers to access as
they possible can  -- a mess of blind-reply posts, publishing of private
email addresses, HTML posts, inability to follow subject-lines, and a
general mis-match and occlusion of discourse which ends up 'nowhere'
because of the mounds upon mounds of irrelevant, recycled content piled
up due to members inability to speak in context.

It's all one =3Dbig=3D inside joke I guess for list members -- ha ha


*** HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO ***

Maybe this is the call for more electronic works. Print on demand is a nice
option, but online publications are where its at. Now we, as artists and
scholars, must begin to accept the electronic as a real format. And by real
I mean, of course, a format that will be seen as equal to a printed book.
Currently we have many fine journal articles of real value that appear only
online, and if this was taken further - there will be more knowledge
available to all who would want it any time they want it.
Maybe UB can begin this process of bringing quality literary criticism on
it's EPC as it has with MP3.

UC Press cuts back offerings
By Tim Rutten
Los Angeles Times
4/26/02

University presses, one of the pillars of U.S. intellectual life, are in
trouble, beset by mounting financial losses and an ongoing identity crisis.

The latest victim of this trend is the University of California Press, the
West's most prestigious publisher and, as measured by sales revenues, one
of its largest.

*Out with philosophy*
As part of a general retrenchment, the UC Press will no longer produce
books on philosophy, architecture, archaeology, political science or
geography. It will publish dramatically less literature and far fewer works
of literary theory. Twelve jobs have been eliminated through attrition, and
further job cuts are planned.

``We lost more than $1 million last year,'' said Lynne Withey, acting
director of UC Press.

``In fact, all of the major university presses lost money in the last
fiscal year. Some of us just lost more than others.''

The University of California subsidizes just a little more than 7 percent
of the press's budget. The rest must come from sales revenues, which last
year amounted to $15 million from books and $3 million from journals.

``We can't just trim a little here or cut a little over there anymore. We
need to make changes in the kinds of books we publish.''

To decide what those changes would be, the UC Press enlisted the consulting
company of McKinsey and Co., which offered its help pro bono. The
consultants' recommended that UC follow the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and reduce its list to fields where its sales are strongest.

*Formula for success?*
McKinsey, Withey said, ``came up with a formula under which we will do 80
percent of our business in six fields where we're already strong'' --
history, anthropology, sociology, religion, biology and natural history.

``It was very hard to abandon things like philosophy, which is a core
discipline in the academy,'' Withey said. ``The whole process has been a
series of painful decisions.''

At least one UC scholar was, well, philosophical about the cutbacks.
``Given the reality of the marketplace as a force in our lives, there is
only so much money you can lose,'' said John R. Searle, a philosophy
professor at the University of California-Berkeley.

``Obviously I want more books to be published -- especially, good
philosophy books -- but you can't go on losing money on them forever,''
said Searle.

But another of Berkeley's leading scholars disagrees. ``Even apart from
this cutback, the mandate of university presses has been gravely undermined
over the past few years,'' said Robert Alter, professor of Hebrew and
comparative literature. ``The idea originally was that bringing out serious
works that were a contribution to scholarship, but not viable for a
commercial publisher, was the university press's obligation to the world of
knowledge."

I reply:

It's an interesting question, and one touched on a couple times in the
journal, ironically enough. I agree and disagree with you though.
Agree, in that a high percentage of any journal is not, um, lasting art.
But I disagree as to the necessary ulterior motives you place upon
these people.

And Perelman, specifically, has, as his main focus, just this issue. The
issue of "The Academy" and "The Poet." He references Silliman's
"attack on academia," and includes an interesting, if imperfect,
answer.

Other writers take swipes at both The Iowa Workshop (ha, since this
is The Iowa Review, after all . . .) and SUNY Buffalo. This last swipe
comes from Mark Levine, and while his argument (that language
writing, and language writers, participate to a large degree in a cynical
attempt at gaining favor from "theorists" who aren't interested in
"good" art) is, as well, imperfect, it is worth reading . . . he even has a
point or two. (But then again, aren't there a great many petty poets
out there of each technical stripe that are trying to manipulate things
just a bit? And wouldn't I, gulp, just love it if some theorist suddenly
said "OMIGOSH  LOOKIT  THIS!" over my work?)

Anyway, I think these journals from universities (The Iowa Review,
Denver Quarterly, The Colorado Review, and several, many actually,
others), have much to contribute to the conversation . . . and since
they publish poets like Cole Swensen, Susan Wheeler, etc . . . and are
edited by poets like Bin Ramke and Donald Revell, etc . . . etc . . . you
know?

Even if I am, as well, sometimes grumpy on the issue. As we are all
often grumpy on most issues . . .

Dearest Derek R,

I am an anarchist and feel your effort to bind me to your scheme of
things is unwarranted and unfair. I don't argue with your high
importance of issues which are of no importance. Leave me out of your
mania, please. I am a good natured sort and if you wish to converse
about it off list I'll be happy to do so. I see this reply to specific
posts as important as threads go on and on and to what one person is
replying to may not have anything to do with the current exchange. So
please your control over my emailing habits has lead you to explore my
poetry and post. How strangely fortunate you must feel.

What blind-reply posters don't seem to (have the intelligence to) grasp,
is that the body potion of your emails are actually end up as the basic
unit known as the web page (i.e. this isn't gopher anymore).

When you post to the poetics list your email ends up as a web page here
-->
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html

If you are replying blindly, you contribute to publishing a trail of
irrelevant garbage and exhaust so that the single basic unit of the web
page is destroyed, since it contains a copy of a whole other page(s).

Therefore the search feature (onsite and web) does not work as intended
-- the message is deliberately shaded from access by the public.

For instance, Geoffrey Gatza sends an email containing the text "Luffalo
Poetry Sucks," to 2 different lists (plus some others we won't mention
for simplicity):

1.."Imitationpoetics@Topica. Com" <imitationpoetics@topica.com>

2..UB Poetics discussion Group <POETICS@LISTSERV.ACSU.BUFFALO.EDU>


...which immediately creates a searchable web page for both archived

with an internet connection...:

Very good... Instant knowledge creation and reference  -->


... BUT WAIT.. Notice how UB Poetics *does not* appear as a search
result! That's because

a) Poetics has not registered with http://google.com

or

b) did register and Google rejected you because your members don't know
how to post email to a discussion list.


You see, ideally, posters to this list would have their contributions
web-archived and searchable automatically.

So that, one could, immediately after the post, go to http://google.com
and search for "Luffalo Poetry Sucks" under the 'Groups' tab and get
back an answer.

If anyone here is truly interested in defining terms like 'language
poetry' for instance, this is how you go about it, -- by being a search
result, by being accessible (ie. you answer when someone asks)

Raises a bunch of other questions (putting aside the "who cares?" factor
for a moment).

I'm currently in the final throes of editing (with Harry Polkinhorn) Across
the Line/ Al otro lado: the poetry of Baja California (due out in August),
a bilingual monster  that includes 55 poets (selected from the couple of
hundred active and publishing on the peninsula), all living. Eight teach
literature, 5 or 6 teach other subjects. None teach creative writing in
universities--as in most of the world there are no creative writing
programs. What they have instead is a network of free workshops open to
anyone at the universities and cultural centers or any place else that will
provide the space. That's all they provide--running a workshop is a
voluntary activity. And of course people go to readings and dissolve in
groups into various bars after workshop or reading. One group of poets can
be found reliably at a particular bar any Friday at 9 p.m.  All of the
poets are vastly knowledgeable about each other's work and almost all about
Spanish language literature and beyond.

This is in a provincial corner of Mexico. multiply the figures by all of
the other centers,m provincial and metropolitan, in Latin America (for a
start) and you wind up with a lot of poets for whom universities were a
place to get an education and nothing more--in societies that have a much
higher regard for poets and poetry than the US but that don't pay them to
be poets. A fair number do some literary journalism or journal articles to
make some dough and because they feel they have something to say. They have
to compete for the print space to do so with all of the other unaffiliated
writers and journalists.

A miserable life for some, and no easy or secure gigs for any. But there's
an amazing amount of good poetry being made.

Toss this into the "academy, pro or con" pot.

Mark

mark, i'm hesitant to respond to this thread, as all i can see
rearing forth here is another Big Can Of Worms... and i know you're
smart enough to know what a can of worms it is...

but as a creative writing faculty member, i'm not being paid "to be a
poet"---not quite... the ontological nudge here is precisely what's
wrong with academics in fact (no self-loathing implied or
intended)---i.e., they don't like to see themselves in terms of the
labor they're actually being paid *to do* (and yes, the older i get,
the more i'm inclined toward dewey's empirical naturalism, with its
emphasis on practice)... i'm being paid to teach, administer, and on
and on and on... that includes "teaching how to write poetry" (ARGH),
yes, and how to read poetry, etc...

but any number of academic commentators (evan watkins comes
immediately to mind, but there are many) will tell you that "the job"
is not to be understood aright via the language of being...

now there's nothing inherently "less" or "suspect" about doing what i
do, depending on how one (me) goes about *doing* it... in that ~iowa
review~ issue j gallaher mentions you will find an excerpt from my
and kass fleisher's long (long) ~ebr~ essay, out last summer
("reforming creative writing pedagogy")... kass and i are married,
and as an adjunct worker (worker), kass doesn't get paid (quite) to
do the work that i do as a tenure-track faculty member (and vice
versa)... in any case, i take it as ethically responsible, if one is
going to be paid (in part anyway) to teach, to try to reform said
teaching institution... as with any institution, it could generally
stand improvement (and if you know me, and you do, you know how
goddamn hard i can be on creative writing institutions)... i'll set
aside the teaching-publishing nexus for now (as again, this would
crank open that can, above, even more)...

but as an apologia, if i must, though i'd rather be understood not in
terms of coming to anyone's defense...

best,

Hi Murat!

A 'blind reply' is one which (blindly) quotes an *entire* message back
to the discussion list.

It is acceptable to reply without quoting any of the original message,
or to reply to particular quotes of a original message, BUT NOT the
entire message as a quote, and NOT the message headers (private info).

*Only include text from the original message relevant to the
conversation.*

Browse around http://groups.google.com or http://groups.yahoo.com to get
the idea of this and to realize it is a generally, globally accepted,
discussion 'best practice' which allows for multi-layered, ongoing,
inclusive discourse without barriers to reference (barrier-free for both
the search-engine indexing software, and actual humans).


cheers, derek

Jackson Mac Low included a work in his book-Bloomsday-(Station Hill,1984)
called -Unmanifest-I'll quote it in full below:


Unmanifest

What the author of a manifesto does not comprehend or acknowledge is the
basic unmanifestness from which and within which each manifestation takes
place. It is this neglect or ignorance that calls forth repugnance when a
manifesto is proclaimed or published, especially one regarding art. As if
what comes to being in and as the work of art could ever be totally manifest
or even manifest at all without its abiding steadfastly in the unmanifest! A
work of art is a manifesto only insofar as it is its own antimanifesto.

(Jackson Mac Low) 21 June, 1983
New York

Also, check out the related poem from the same book -Manifest-written two
days earlier- ending with the line "Every text worth reading is a manifesto"

Hi,
Non-sense is not  necessarily
no-sense. Similar to how
non-existence does not necessarily
mean no-existence. (huh ?)
let me attempt to clarify...
What constitutes our sense or/of
existence does not always take
into consideration former incarnations
of what 'sense' might have been
conceived to potentialities 'beyond'
our contemporary grasp.
Perception is a paradox, whereas it is
both solipsistic and, 'by laws that be',
must relate to the collective consciousness
we all partake in.
So 'sense' must be a 'matter' of attunement
to auras and tonalities that we can, at times,
see, hear, and cogitate according to 'our'
sensate leanings. We do our constitutions
an injustice by limiting them to the ephemeral,
watered -down effigies that we accept as dogma.

Just thot I'd add my 2 sense (groan) ...
                                Ric Carfagna

Dodie. Sincere congratulations: but even I feel a bit queasy about the
title. But there you are: I wrote a poem (and even read in Auckland and then
later in New York) called:  "The Fuck" which was "inspired" by Roger
Horrocks's (professor at Auck Uni and poet and film enthusiast (especailly
of the avant garde (to use a word) and writer of a book about the NZ artist
Len Lye) reading of "Cocks" by Anne Sexton...mind you my poem was quite
different in tone and wouldntwrite in hat style now (not frightened of the
title or the subject).
  Still, that aside, good on you for winning with your book. Richard.

I have waited for a while to reply to this post. My understanding is that th=
e=20
Middle East refers to the Levant and includes others besides the Arab writer=
s.

Ammiel Alcalay, for instance, is an American poet who has written on and=20
translated from Israeli and former Yugoslavian  writers. His book "After Jew=
s=20
and Arabs" reveals the deep historical connections which exist between the=20
two cultures, how Jews and Arabs lived side by side in the Levant. His=20
anthology of Israeli writers focuses on Turkish, Syrian, Iraqi Jewish writer=
s=20
neglected by the Israeli literary establishment ("Keys to the Garden," City=20
Lights Press). His translations from Semerdrin Mehmedenovic, "Sarajevo=20
Blues," were also published by City Lights Books.

I am another American poet who has been translating Turkish poets for many=20
years. "I, Orahan Veli" (Hanging Loose Press) and "A Blind Cat Black and=20
Orthodoxies" (Sun and Moon) are two books available in the United States. #=20
14 of Talisman magazine (William Bronk issue) has a Turkish poetry section,=20
which includes eight poets and the essay, "a Godless Sufism: Ideas on 20th=20
Century Turkish Poetry." The last two issues of Talisman magazine (#'s 20 an=
d=20
21) feature translations from two other Turkish poets, Lale M=FCld=FCr and A=
hmet=20
G=FCntan. They are part of the work I am doing for the upcoming Turkish=20
anthology to be published by Talisman Books. As part of the same=20
work-in-process, A.Bacus published the chapbook, "Pitcher," my translations=20
of the poet Sami Baydar, last February.

I am sure work has been done on Iranian and Greek writers also. For instance=
,=20
Eleni Eleskianos is involved in preparing a Greek anthology.

I don't understand this, Leonard. I don't understand what  you say.

Nowhere here does Hilton say anything like "nothing the Jews say makes
sense". Nor, that I can see, does he make *any generalisations about Jews.
It is all about Palestine and Israel.

The accusation is one of bad faith and slipperiness.

Also, you attribute this supposed accusation - "nothing the Jews say makes
sense" - to Europe; but I have never heard that said anywhere.  I have heard
all sorts of other racist nonsense: you can generate fair approximations of
some by taking a Sharon speech into your word processor and exchanging
"Jews" for "Terrorists"

Implicit in this odd attack on Europe  is that slurs against Jews are
limited to Europe.  I don't  think that's true.

I take Hilton's post to be serious, posing problems and questions which need
some explaining. I can see that they are uncomfortable questions for anyone
whose position is pro-Israel; but long term it doesn't help to misrepresent
them

Hello everyone,
I just wanted to remind everyone here that I am doing publicity for Kaya
Press, a press handling contemporary Asian writing. I am looking to book
Sesshu Foster, Josie Foo, Ed Lin, and Luis Francia (poets and fiction
writers) at reading venues everywhere and anywhere! I will be happy to send
info and review copies to anyone considering Kaya for their University,
Bookstore, or reading space. These authors are all marvelous. Let me know if
you have room for the summer or fall. I can also help you organize any kind
of Asian-themed festival or reading if you are interested in working with
Kaya and your own press.
Thanks so much!
Prageeta Sharma

Interesting review in light of the decline of university presses and the
rise of a multitude of online endevors that don't seem (in general) to last.

Glazier's book does have it's roots in 'ancient history and my impression
was that it was originally aimed at the actual writer of e-poetry and that
editorial direction tried to change it into something for academics and
theoreticians?

Dear poets, editors, critics; in short, friends:

While trying to rent Spalding Gray's "Swimming to Cambodia" to show my
workshop, I found that it had been removed permanently from the shelves of
St. Louis Blockbusters. So I bought a copy on Half.com and have watched it
2.5 times in recent weeks. I now realize that it is one of the texts that
has been most influential on me as a writer. That is, I often find myself
shaping language like Gray, intuitively, humorously, etc.

I wonder if others have a similar admiration for this monolog. I rarely hear
of Spalding Gray, though I once met him after a Ginsberg reading at St.
Marks; he rambled on very pleasantly about "Mahtha's Vineyahd."  And I saw
him give a monolog at Washington U a few years ago (where his twin brother
Rockwell teaches).  Where is he now?

It seems to me that "Swimming to Cambodia" is a good case against what
Jessica said about sound being "secondary" to sight.

-Aaron

I'm passing this along for my favorite living cartoonist:

Dear Friend,
   I live on Long Island, and I've been living there nearly two years.
However, I am only barely acquainted with my new home, having rarely left
the garage, which is where I've been working on a book day and night for the
past year. I hardly talk to anyone, even on the phone, because my self-worth
is so dependent on my work that with my book as yet unfinished, I have no
ego, and I am reduced to a pulsating, quivering mass of fearful, paranoid
id. I hope to finish the book by next Monday.
   Coincidentally, I will be giving a slide presentation the very next day
at a bookstore in Manhattan.
   Unfortunately, the book ("The Diary of a Teenage Girl") will not be
printed and available until July or August, but nevertheless, it will be
finished, and finishing a book is a daunting, yet necessary, step in the
process of getting it published. I will be reading a bit from the book on
Tuesday night.
   If you are in Manhattan (and not otherwise engaged) next Tuesday the 14th
of May, please come to hear me speak. I will be at this place:

Bluestockings Women's Bookstore & Cafe (http://bluestockings.booksense.com)
172 Allen St. New York, NY 10002
Tel: 212-777-6028

Please forgive this intrusion, and have a happy day.

Hello Aaron,

Spalding Gray is a great one.  I have seen him a number of times.  In public,
most poets read aloud the way one might read quietly to one's self, or the way
one might read imaginatively.  For me, it was Gray who taught me (in a live
contemporary sense) that language is its fullest when spoken, and that the job
of poetry is to keep that element when putting it on the page.  If you like
Swimming, you should rent "Monster in a Box," his monologue on the struggle of
finishing his book, Gray's Anatomy.  The latter is also a great book as well.

I love Spalding, too (and have a bit of a crush on
him).  He's around, don't worry--a couple summers ago
he was doing improv monlogues based on audience
participation, and recently he's back out with a
revised version of one of the older works...I think it
might be "Swimming," actually. "Monster in a Box" is
also available on video.  _Sex and Death to Age
Fourteen_, a book, is available as well.

I never thought of him as an influence, but he may
well be...I love his blend of personal tragi-comedy.
And actually, a lot of 80s performance art, as it
were, was a big influence me--I was a young writer
then, and somewhat addicted to a show on PBS (anyone
remember the name?) that aired sometimes avant-garde
performance stuff, including Gray and also a Mac
Wellman piece, "Sister Suzie Cinema."  I watched
"Sister Susie" with my parents (I was in high school
then) and was just spellbound by it--in fact, having
only seen it once, 15 years ago, I still remember the
tune to the main song.  It was perhaps my first
encounter with a kind of Language poetry.  I didn't
know what to make of it at all, and I loved it
completely.

A few years later I found Holly Hughes, Karen Finley
et al.  This was definitely an early influence.

Thanks for bringing this up!
Arielle

I second the call for electronic publication.  What should a university
faculty require of its members beyond intellectual work approved by
disciplinary peers?  If there ever was a time when publication of a book
by a "reputable" press guaranteed its intellectual quality (Barthes'
feudal *index*), the admission by presses of the profit motive transforms
that index into the bourgeois *sign*.  I read UC Press's statement to say
that one more sloppy rehash of Sylvia Plath will always be welcomed, while
the whole discipline of philosophy goes begging.

Requiring print publications for academic promotion secures only three
results as far as I can tell: the academy rewards renown rather than
research, it ensures continued intellectual laziness on the part of
tenured faculty, who no longer need to read (that is, deal with the ideas
of) texts written by their own community, and it guarantees that those
with print access will continue to control the direction of scholarship as
those who cannot afford print access stay quietly in the dark.

The latest MLA newsletter has S. Greenblatt bemoaning the lack of
resources available to a group of humanities scholars in Bucharest.  His
solution: let the MLA operate as an email contact clearinghouse,
connecting scholars from around the world with MLA members who will then
assist with information exchange, conversation, perhaps photocopies.
Great.  How about S. Greenblatt putting a PDF version of his latest book
online for scholars around the world to download and read?

performance text improvisation - New Jersey Institute of Technology -
5/7/02

(not satisfied with this; it lacks the structure of the others; we've just
arrived in new york; i was following suit; i was doing my best - thanks to
Chris Funkhouser who brought me - i was trying my hardest)

===

we're all waiting for a sign...

these are asteroids, camera fly-byes (fly-bies?) - fly bees... across
three-dimensional spaces created in Blender - www.blender.nl

my work's concerned with language, sexuality, the virtual body and
subjectivity - all of these elements interacting online and off -

i'm concerned with what happens beneath the surface, the coding, the
psychoanalytics, the substances

i'm concerned about messes, tangles, messiness, entanglement ...

all of this work is tangled,confused - these images are from the
everglades. we went into them about 2-4 times a wekk or so, thats week,
that's that's - not wekk... i was interested in messiness and the way that
everything was both about desire - for us, obsessiveness, and at the same
time an impenetrable ecosystem - the longer we were there, the more we
understood about the images - about what we were seeing - the intersection
of varis various biomes....

all playing into notinos on notions of language 9had too much coffee *
just got in from miami) - this is mime movie - azure (myh partner) and I
mimed for the camera - working through what were the "usual" black box -
getting out of glass, swimming, up and down stairs, that sort of thing -
so that what's present is a kind of languaging, no?

a language of mime that's otherwise silent; this was getting poretty
boring to us so we sped things up and went to hell...

it fascinates me to be able to work withdifferent rates of movement/voice
in all of this - as if there are different worlds emerging.

early on we did some work emphasizing this with foofwa d'immobilite, who
had danced with merce cunningham - arranged a piece in which myh voice
triggered his traditional ballet movement to the point of exhaustion...

i've been fascinated by dance and its relation to desire, and a way to
think through the body without spoken language or discretge symbols - you
have the same difficulties here that you do with film "language" - what
constitutes a wor d or phoneme, how do0es tradition play out when
tradition is something that escapes discrete symbols?

on top of which dance is HARD - difficult to do - there's labor involved -
and there's labor in spoken language and written language and
production/distribution in every sense of the term....

so we were pushing for this - what amounted to a deconstruction of dance
through dance - turning dance (like everything else here) into a mess -

how does one create/approach a mess?

we were playhing charactgers that are avatars I use online - nikuko the
russian ballet dancer and doctor leopold konninger, a name that came to me
in a dream.

konninger comes out of Grosz's drawings of pre-war and otherwise Germany -

he has a monacle but I never wore one.

he and nikuko were involved together in a round-robin relationship - she
would dance for him and he would pay her - it was a continuous pirouette -
again the labor/money context is clear - here is a part of the sequence -
all of this earlier work, about a year ago or so, revolves around body and
flesh - issues of skin and interior -

in florida, the everglades dominated. there are few tourists at this
point; they're almost abandoned at times. you can walk in the middle of
the night through miles of swamp and no one is around at all. you'll find
insects and other fauna you've never seen before. at first you focus on
safety and alligators and snakes; then you begin to descend into the
layers, moving more and more into a submerged landscape almost out of J.G.
Ballard, a landscape of surreal dimensions. These bugs you see for example
- I have not been able to find them in any book at all - no one knows what
they are. This butterfly is the atala, an endangered species, extremely
rare - this goes on and on - from the fauna then back to the landscapes
themselves which change subtlely

the park is created from organisms - there are no geological features
readily visible; everything you see is alive, beneath your feet, or on
occasion overhead ..

we played obsessively out here, first filming ourselves in the
environment, merging sexuality, then trying to read the codes and then
finding the codes deeper and deeper, almost as if they were a series of
circular passages in a moo or mud...

eventallly we produced SEALS - based on ideograms referencing breath,
sexuality, circularity, exhaustion - these have become a foundation or
rather reference for the rest of the work -

in seals, there are five cameras; they're triggered by the sound. the man
writes on the woman, seals her it with a chop/hanko. the woman writes on
the man, filling his body with signs; the sign for negation just above the
genitals.

the man writes on the woman, just as otherwise.

the woman seals the man.

but before the sealing: erasure, as the bodies flood each other, erasing
symbol/image simultaneously - again the relationship to desire and
language is obvious.

my work is idiotic; it covers the same ground over and over. but it's
clever in its use of masquerade and disguise, as if new things were being
constantly discovered.

On the left you just saw the death of a digital camera in the everglades
after swamping a canoe... the rest of the images are with another -

with quicktime, sound moves from foreground channel to foreground channel;
it can be set otherwise, but muddies...

on the left, black mangrove thicket in the northern everglades.

this is our ever-popular welcome to miami film.

(We hated miami.)

cattail swamp - which is useful for cleaning out pollutants as part of the
everglades reconstruction project...

as if we're on ecstasy or as if we're collapsing....

how does this fit together?

it doesn't - or rather it's a question of approaching things. I'm
intersted in that - how one approaches things, particuolarly things that
are a mess - messy relationships, messy bodies, messy environments - which
of course begs the question - one has to learn to listen to the begging -
one has to study it.. my work has moved in a strange way out of language.
it's always been at war with words, with thinking language through and
through, using shell accounts, unix/linux, and hundreds of editing/coding
tools - well dozens, anyway.

but faced with bodies, with desire, with tangles, how does language work -
without listening, and without the foreclosing that language of course
always implies? it's better not to name things for a while - particularly
in these difficult political times when names are useful for the raveling
of hatreds on a universal scale... these are images of a desiccated lake
in the everglades dry season - a tricolored heron hunting - a coastland
prairie here - black mangrove roots - crfab carapace, marsh hare, turkey
vulture, cypress dome -

the environment changes over a height of inches - the cypress dome is
partially submerged. the highest point in the everglades is four feet -
where you might have pinelands or hardwood hammocks. this is the cypress
dome, wandering through one. and these are exotic mating muscovie ducks
and we'll end with this I think? already a foreign intrustion (these
ducks) into the everglades, rendering everything problematic once again -

Not sure if she quite fits the bill, but Venus Khoury-Gata is an amazing
Lebanese-French poet. At least one collection, the title of which I have
forgotten, is available in English, translated by Marilyn Hacker and
published by Field/Oberlin College.

look at Brian Stefan's www.arras.net for pdf files of criticism (as well as
links to other sites with downloadable books), not to mention the
durationpress.com site (which, if I'm to trust Brian's assessment, has more
pdf files than any site he knows of). so this kind of work is being done.
the epc, unfortunately, is lagging behind.

I watched "Swimming to Cambodia" two years ago while waiting to go to
Cambodia to adopt my son; certainly Gray touches on very tough stuff in that
video (I actually don't remember it the way I remember "The Killing Fields"
but do remember finding it a sensitive piece).

But I do hope your students, Aaron, get a sense of the horrors inflicted on
Cambodia by such as Henry Kissinger.  Important material.

The members of the list are all aware that UC is also a major lit publisher
(Oppen and Niedecker just now, Lezama Lima shortly, just of books that I'm
aware of), and that lit (as opposed to crit) was not on the list of areas
to be pursued? That, to my mind, is the real loss that's threatened by the
change in university press publishing. And I don't think web publication
does the trick.

I was speaking to what was *implicit* in Hilton's remarks--I'm sure you
understand the concept--old-world (yes, European) anti-semitism now
expresses itself as being "about Israel" instead of being "about Jews" but
the essence of the mindset is pretty much the same.

Well, I got this last week, too, when I raised questions about
Israel-bashing on the list. It seems that I'm supposed to first accept all
of your premises and outrageous statements of "fact" and then speak from
there. (Reminds me of being a university student -- god forbid that reality
should get in the way of  a good theory.)

Hello Susan,
Yes - I think that's a powerful piece. I saw Spalding
Gray do that here in Sydney at Belvoir Street Theatre
some years ago. Just him, seated at a table with a jug
of water, the microphone (of course) & a few,
unintrusive back-projected transparencies up behind
him. It was rivetting.

CHANGES TO SUB VOICIVE POETRY (London UK)

The SVP seasons are January to July + September to December, with breaks
during much of December and early January & for much of July, all of August
and some of September - Xmas and summer holidays

Currently, the starting point is an attempt to arrange a reading /
performance once every two weeks during the season. These are readings in
whatever room is available, currently one of two at The Betsey Trotwood,
Farringdon Rd. This pattern is added to, or readings are replaced, by
collaborations with others (Birkbeck CPRC, October Gallery, Camden People's
Theatre and others -  details in website documentation)

Camden People's Theatre is the latest collaboration and the first reading
there was a success in all senses; but subsequent readings there need to be
supported - more so perhaps because while the capacity is greater so are the
overheads

This year, in response to continuing poor and / or unpredictable turnout,
the basic programme has been cut, ad hoc. Attendance has got worse. That's
usually the way with cuts, but the readings have to pay their small way (a
few more people does it) AND not be an insult to the performer. It is better
to cut or cancel than do THAT

THE CHANGE: The programming starting point will now be an attempt to arrange
a reading / performance once every FOUR weeks as the basic  programme during
the season. If what is offered is supported, the frequency will be
increased; and vice versa; but, in the latter case, towards a rapid
closedown.

A second reading during June was more than contemplated, though it might not
have happened; but those plans will now be dropped. It will not happen.
Ditto July.

Potentially, these are the only cuts that will be made; or they are the
beginning of a closure. In the words of supermarkets - and many urge a
retailer / consumer approach to poetry on svp - use it or lose it. Don't
take it for granted.

Tell your friends about the series. Help advertise it. A *handful of people
is the difference between a healthy audience and a bad one. It isn't the
Albert Hall that has to be filled. If you have programming ideas, say so;
but there is no intention of greatly changing the aesthetic direction of the
series or of compromising on the principle that each poet has a reasonable
length of time to present her work... No slams, not even nudges

Collaborations with others will continue.

A central aspect of SVP is the presentation of oversea poets and that must
continue or there is no point in continuing at all. (The abandoned July
reading would have been a relatively unknown oversea poet on whom the series
was going to take an informed chance.)

The 6th colloquium will go ahead in 2003 - more later. It can be one of many
more or it can be the last. The proceedings publication is now in
preparation, the deadline for final versions having passed, and should be
available in the autumn of this year

All the best to all of you. (None of this is aimed personally. It arises
from a belief that a reading without an audience is no reading at all)

The members of the list are all aware that UC is also a major lit publisher
(Oppen and Niedecker just now, Lezama Lima shortly, just of books that I'm
aware of), and that lit (as opposed to crit) was not on the list of areas
to be pursued? That, to my mind, is the real loss that's threatened by the
change in university press publishing. And I don't think web publication
does the trick.

I second the call for electronic publication.  What should a university
faculty require of its members beyond intellectual work approved by
disciplinary peers?  If there ever was a time when publication of a book
by a "reputable" press guaranteed its intellectual quality (Barthes'
feudal *index*), the admission by presses of the profit motive transforms
that index into the bourgeois *sign*.  I read UC Press's statement to say
that one more sloppy rehash of Sylvia Plath will always be welcomed, while
the whole discipline of philosophy goes begging.

Requiring print publications for academic promotion secures only three
results as far as I can tell: the academy rewards renown rather than
research, it ensures continued intellectual laziness on the part of
tenured faculty, who no longer need to read (that is, deal with the ideas
of) texts written by their own community, and it guarantees that those
with print access will continue to control the direction of scholarship as
those who cannot afford print access stay quietly in the dark.

The latest MLA newsletter has S. Greenblatt bemoaning the lack of
resources available to a group of humanities scholars in Bucharest.  His
solution: let the MLA operate as an email contact clearinghouse,
connecting scholars from around the world with MLA members who will then
assist with information exchange, conversation, perhaps photocopies.
Great.  How about S. Greenblatt putting a PDF version of his latest book
online for scholars around the world to download and read?

This is a jaded view of the peer-review process.  It seems to concentrate
on its perceived effects instead of its goals, which center around the
judgement of research prior to dissemination.  The reason why it is a
measure for tenure promotion is because, for years, it was the best way to
evidence the production of worthwhile research and criticism.

PDF as a distribution tool has its flaws precisely because it ignores any
sort of feedback loop.  Print publication goes through a dual feedback
loop (although it's a slow one)--the editorial pre-publication process and
the market feedback (i.e. sales of the book and criticism).  PDF bypasses,
in many ways, both.  Digital media has the opportunity to supplant print
media in many areas, but it must play into its own strengths as a
organizational media.  Ironically, I'll point to a short essay in PDF
format which suggests ways peer-review may be supplanted or supplemented
in digital media:

http://brandonbarr.com/rtej-barr.pdf

Digital media's database structures allow self-organizing publishing
systems to florish (the essay focuses on epinions.com; today I would point
to outlets like slashdot.org or the blogging community). This format of
publication is, I would argue, VASTLY more effective than the peer-review
process at determining the effectiveness of a writer's contributions.  In
systems like this, networks of associates are formed between writers based
upon individual respec.  The top writers float to the top--but even
lesser-known authors can develop a direct audience base.

The challenge is to challenge our notions of how we measure research.

I'm not suggesting that the presses stop.  There are valuable works
published everyday.  I don't see anything wrong with an author's decision
to go that route.  What I'm suggesting is that digital media offer new
opportunities to share data among researchers (one of its original
purposes), and that we should ivestigate those options instead of simply
accepting the tools we currently rely on.  If online publications, as
Geoffery Gatza puts it, are "where its at," then we need to make sure that
the form of those publications plays into the strengths of digital media.

Elizabeth,

You didn't insult me. I just dug into my former life to offer a possible =
explanation of why people in the humanities inflate their language with =
scientific terminology. Before posting the message,  I edited out my =
comments on how ridiculous the bastardized language sounded. Example: =
where I worked I sometimes imagined one human services manager as a =
minor character in a TV sitcom, occasionally discussing an " interim =
data performance interface matrix" in an office setting, then walking =
out, leaving everyone to scratch their heads.=20

Ric,

I can see your "non-sense" as extending the possibilities of language. =
Instead of "meaning" in the sense of a rational, self-contained =
statement, language can create a sensual experience, partly though its =
sound, is presence on the page and the sensations each word conjures in =
the context of the words around it. It might be "non-sense," but more =
"sensual" than conventional usage. Stephen Ratcliffe's "spaces in the =
light said to be where one/comes from" comes to mind as an example.

In one case, we have  abuse of language in an attempt at sophistication. =
In the other, we have a sophisticated use of language.

Or am I not fully awake yet?

  Hi,
  Non-sense is not  necessarily
  no-sense. Similar to how
  non-existence does not necessarily
  mean no-existence. (huh ?)
  let me attempt to clarify...
  What constitutes our sense or/of
  existence does not always take
  into consideration former incarnations
  of what 'sense' might have been
  conceived to potentialities 'beyond'
  our contemporary grasp.
  Perception is a paradox, whereas it is
  both solipsistic and, 'by laws that be',
  must relate to the collective consciousness
  we all partake in.
  So 'sense' must be a 'matter' of attunement
  to auras and tonalities that we can, at times,
  see, hear, and cogitate according to 'our'
  sensate leanings. We do our constitutions
  an injustice by limiting them to the ephemeral,
  watered -down effigies that we accept as dogma.



  Just thot I'd add my 2 sense (groan) ...

Let me try this again.  I responded at first to your use of "the Jews,"
after I have spent some time questioning and complicating the terms of
discussion about the conflict.  And attempting to discover and recover
language is one of the goals of this list.  Yet, in another post, you have
decided there is something "implicit" in the piece I wrote about
settlements being segregated housing projects.  I thought I was quite
explicit.  But what is important underlying your comment is the
long-generated sense of fear of anti-Semitism, which is very real.  As a
term, like all the others, it needs to be examined, particularly because it
is employed so frequently in the defense of Israel, often as a
slander.  There is a harsh reality in France and other places where
synagogues have been attacked, and I suspect that, if the attackers were
supporters of the Palestinians, it's because the policies of Israel are
identified with "the Jews" in much the same way that supporters of Israel
speak about "the Arabs," despite the fact that Jews in France are just as
likely to come from Egypt and feel alienated from Israel.  The Zionist
movement has spent decades, particularly after 1973, attempting to identify
Judaism with Zionism and Israel, and those who attack "the Jews" are driven
in part by their own distorted ideologies (such as a hateful reading of the
Koran) and precisely by the identification the Zionist movement has sought
so long to achieve.

Here is a story: a family of friends lived for generations in Lebanon, part
of the long-established Jewish community there, and they were quite
happy.  But then came Zionism and the displacement of Palestinians, and the
first rumbles of the civil war in Lebanon.  In 1968 the oldest son of the
family joined a demonstration of Lebanese in support of the Palestinians
and the end of the "confessional" system in Lebanon.  He was arrested by
the increasingly reactionary government, and because the family's passports
were Syrian (who made those distinctions when France ruled it all or, even
before, when the Ottoman's lorded over the region?) the family was
deported.  Syria was far too repressive, and they ended up moving to
France.  But these were people of the Levant, and the weather and the
culture of France were disagreeable to them.  Yet, where could they
go?  They ended up moving to Israel, despite their disgust with the nature
of the country, because at least they were back "home," i.e. the Levant,
and they hid their sadness and sense of bitter irony.

How many people have been shoved around or killed because of notions about
"the Jews" and "the Arabs"?

And for some reason you think that I am asserting that "nothing the Jews
say makes sense."  The peace movement in Israel calls the present military
offensive by Israel as "The War of the Settlements."  This seems to make
sense, revealing the underlying goal of Sharon.  And now, in response to
Palestinian violence, the idea is floated that there should be a wall
built.  This, on the other hand, makes no sense.  Walls along the "green
line" and walls around the settlements -- and walls even alongside the
separate (but unequal) "by-pass" roads connecting the settlements.  And, I
suppose, as the settlements are expanded and new ones are built, as more
and more of the West Bank is expropriated, that those walls will be torn
down only to have new ones built.

Nor is it that the Palestinians are free from hatred and violence -- as yet
another suicide-bombing demonstrates.  And this too is complicated and
needs to be questioned.  Here are a few elements: Yassir Arafat is, sadly,
no Nelson Mandela, but years ago when the PLO asserted that their goal was
a democratic, secular state (not too different from the ANC's call for a
non-racial state), they were castigated as anti-Semitic.  About 15 years
ago, Hamas and other Islamic activists were encouraged by Israel (let go
after arrests, given the green light to organize) because the Israeli
government thought that they could foster an alternative to the secular
PLO.  Well, they were successful, and as Sharon attacks Arafat and the
Fatah and the Palestinian Authority, as ineffective and corrupt as it is,
he is well aware that he is targeting the secular movement.  Once the PLO
is decimated, only Islamic extremism will be left.  And I think Sharon
would prefer this.

I don't think there is anything in what I just wrote that is "implicit."

One way to keep presses that publish the books we would buy anyway viable
is whenever possible to buy directly from the press. That's why if you call
a university press and flash your credit card over the phone you hear
squeals of delight. I'm not kidding. And even more so for small independent
presses.

Breaking off the ordinary flow of experience, the passions
create a state of exception. In their suddenness and
intensity, they map a personal world, fix and qualify our
attention, and impel our actions. Outraged anger drives us
to write laws that will later be enforced by impersonal
justice. Intense grief at the death of someone in our life
discloses the contours of that life to us. Wonder spurs
scientific inquiry.

The strong current of Western thought that idealizes a
dispassionate world has ostracized the passions as quaint,
even dangerous. Intense states have come to be seen as
symptoms of pathology. A fondness for irony along with our
civic ideal of tolerance lead us to prefer the diluted
emotional life of feelings and moods. Demonstrating enormous
intellectual originality and generosity, Philip Fisher
meditates on whether this victory is permanent-and how it
might diminish us.

From Aristotle to Hume to contemporary biology, Fisher finds
evidence that the passions have defined a core of human
nature no less important than reason or desire. Traversing
the Iliad, King Lear, Moby Dick, and other great works, he
discerns the properties of the high-spirited states we call
the passions. Are vehement states compatible with a culture
that values private, selectively shared experiences? How do
passions differ from emotions? Does anger have an opposite?
Do the passions give scale, shape, and significance to our
experience of time? Is a person incapable of anger more
dangerous than someone who is irascible?

In reintroducing us to our own vehemence, Fisher reminds us
that it is only through our strongest passions that we feel
the contours of injustice, mortality, loss, and knowledge.
It is only through our personal worlds that we can know the
world.

Philip Fisher is the Reid Professor of English at Harvard
University. He is the author of Still the New World, Hard
Facts, Wonder, the Rainbow, and the Aesthetics of Rare
Experiences, and Making and Effacing Art.

Endorsements:

"Philip Fisher has written a revisionary history of startling boldness,
rereading the authorities in novel and penetrating ways. His conclusions have
relevance to the inner lives of us all."--J. M. Coetzee, author of The Lives
of
Animals

"This is really a quite extraordinary work, an attempt to reclaim for modern
use a vocabulary we gave up two centuries (or more) ago, and more
importantly,
to reclaim or re-recognize the intense energies that go with that
vocabulary--still present and alive. Fisher's whole project is enormously
compelling. Its scope and force are unmistakable, and will provoke important
discussions."--Michael Wood, Princeton University

Hello friends:

For those of you who live in New York City or who can
otherwise make it there, I'd like to invite you to
attend a panel discussion and publication party for
TELLING IT SLANT: AVANT GARDE POETICS IN THE 1990s,
edited by Mark Wallace and Steven Marks and published
by the University of Alabama Press.

The time is Friday, May 17 from 7-9 p.m., and the
location is The Dactyl Foundation, 64 Grand St. Ground
Floor, between West Broadway and Wooster in Soho. I've
been hearing great things about the space, and I'm
sure it will help make for a wonderful event.

The panel will be discussing issues regarding avant
garde poetries in the 1990s. Following short poetics
statements by the panelists, we'll be opening the
floor to questions and response from the audience.

The likely panelists include:

Charles Borkhuis
Sherry Brennan
Lee Ann Brown
Jeff Derksen
Jefferson Hansen

Andrew Levy
Eileen Myles
Leonard Schwartz
Juliana Spahr
Brian Kim Stefans
Gary Sullivan
Elizabeth Willis

Wine will be available during the discussion, and the
Dactyl Foundation will be suggesting a small donation
at the door.

I'm very excited that we've found such an excellent
location for this event, and I look forward to seeing
you there.

Sincerely,


Mark Wallace

Subject:      Why poets should ignore academic criticism.
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

A bit of a rant:

The academic's first problem is how to advance professionally.  To get and
keep a job, the academic must produce an acceptable discourse.  Not great,
not even very good, just acceptable.  This means sticking to certain
categories -- cliches, really -- that other academics will recognize and
condone.  The cliches are especially important for academics who write
about poetry, because poetry itself is unread and unvalued.  Interview
committees and editors of learned journals are seldom familiar with
contemporary poetry; nor are they bothered by their ignorance, since it has
no professional repercussions.  Typical exchange: "You work on postwar
poetry?  I don't know anything about poetry.  I write about race and gender
in Star Wars."  The aspiring academic would do well to stick to the
approved categories of professional discourse.  Talk about Adorno instead.

I say again, the academic's first problem is how to advance professionally.

This does not mean that all academic criticism is bad, just that there are
distorting forces at work.

The annoying outcome is that those who really succeed within the system
know only the professionally approved ways of talking about literature.
Woe to their students.  But the bigger annoyance comes when poets begin
writing for academic approval.  If Professor X says it is politically
progressive or "avant-garde" to adopt a certain set of techniques, then
that's the kind of mannerist writing that starts to appear, and eventually
someone proposes an MLA panel on it.  It's as if the academics were now
writing the manifestos.

It's no big deal if criticism is policed by anxious assistant professors
who want job security.  I don't blame them.   It's nice work if you can get
it.  But poets should not seek their approval.

(Certainly this view has been articulated before, and better.  But it seems
useful to re-state from time to time.)

equal to a printed book.  Currently we have many fine journal articles of
real value that appear only online, and if this was taken further - there
will be more knowledge available to all who would want it any time they want
it."

Hear. Hear. The problem is not that there are not incredible online
resources but that they do not "count" for academic promotion and are not
always visible or integrated with other kinds of resources through library
and other databases. This, of course, limits their use and spread and reach.

However, there are many initiatives attempting to address those issues in
ways that utilize the possiblities of electronic media while attmepting to
integrate digital publications into the institutional structures established
on print models. With the expectation being that they will transform them as
well. For more information, I can suggest the following two websites, and
I'd love to hear about any sites that you all know about (thank you, Brandon
Barr).

The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition
www.arl.org/sparc

The escholarship program at the California Digital Library
escholarship.cdlib.org

These are just general sites, not poetry or literature specific, but they
give a sense of how peer-reviewed venues are being created in other
disciplines, so far for the most part in the hard and social sciences. From
what I've seen, and I used to work at UC Press and now work for an academic
electronic publishing venture at UC Berkeley, the sciences are way ahead of
the humanities in terms of scholar-initiated transformations of their
communication networks and in terms of getting these outlets
recognized/funded by deans, etc. I agree that unless scholars of all ranks
and affiliations invest in these new outlets, they won't become as
meaningful as they could be.

Though what's at stake in the print book format is a question that I think
is begging to be put on the table and one which I don't think the scientists
can answer or have thought to question. Anyone?

bits of Andrew Rathmann 's bit of a rant:

The academic's first problem is how to advance professionally.  To get and
keep a job, the academic must produce an acceptable discourse.  Not great,
not even very good, just acceptable.  >>>

    This was my perception of the academy even twenty years ago.  It was why
I stayed out of academia and became a civil servant instead. Suspecting
myself of pliability, if not an outright capacity for groveling for
acceptance, I just stayed out of the whole area.  Still, from my outside
vantage, I wonder how true this image really is.

>>It's no big deal if criticism is policed by anxious assistant professors
who want job security.  I don't blame them.   It's nice work if you can get

   Here I'm not so sure where the line can be drawn between 'seeking
approval' and staying current with, and maybe even contributing to, what's
going on in literary theory.  It seems like a great percentage of American
poets look to the academy as their natural, or least onerous, source of
money, including, it seems, a number of those on this list.

Driving home just now I realized that the Earl was in the West Village near
Washington Square Park. Arriving home I rec'd the below message from Mark
Weiss, sure enough.

"Burt: No more reliably than your memory, I recall that it was the fleabag
  on Washington Sq. West and 5th or 6th. I can't post again, having used up
  my alloted two postings, but if you think I may be right pass it along."

It was just off the park, more accurately, on West 4th Street, I'm pretty
sure.

I've come across a poem by Allen DeLoach called "Hotel Earl." Lines
include "ceiling falling down, / bathroom pull cord, / with too
small closet, / twenty cent phone calls / useless view of a wall."  It
was
published in 1963.

My question is - does anyone know where this Hotel Earl was actually
located? if so, could you bc to dkane@panix.com?

Andrew,

Here are a series of guesses at what you are trying to say. You oost is
intersting for the force of it, but self-admittedly general (what you say
has been said before, etc -- but saying this doesn't really help).

Guess #1: "The history of manifestos will bear me out that only poets write
them." The manifesto form was never an exclusively literary genre (nor did
it begin as one), even when it claimed to be that. Moreover, a literary
manifesto has rarely or only partially represented the “play book” to an
actual poetry “game.” Take the classic technical manifesto of Futurism by
Marinetti; his poem “Zam Tuum Tumb” fails to live up to it in multiple ways.
This does not invalidate the social effects that the technical manifesto had
in Marinetti’s time, nor the interest one may still have as a reader (even
as a reader who writes poetry) in his poem and manifesto today.

Guess #2: "Reading academic poetry criticism is a waste of time for poets."
Even if a poet says that s/he is profoundly influenced by a work of academic
poetry criticism, I can’t conceive why that necessarily “results” in mere
imitation of a poetry style (the question of imitation bears also on your
post, and mine, but I'll leave that for another time). If the critic
addresses poetry that the poet has not read before, and the poet then
decides to go and read more of this poetry, why’s that to be dissuaded?

Guess #3: "Academic poetry critics determine the future shape of poetic
form." Let’s take Perloff’s reading of the “I” in poetry (we could take any
of the poets and critics she references on the subject of the "I", instead),
and poet/artist Kenneth Goldsmith’s admiration, stated in his book Soliloquy
(2001), for one of the books in which she delivers a reading on the “I” in
contemporary and past poetry, Radical Artifice (1991). Goldsmith’s
admiration for this book did not prevent him from writing Soliloquy (2001)
which is all “I”. Goldsmith the author may begin to have doubts about
whether he will be able to garner the favors of Perloff as an influential
critic in the poetry and art worlds that Goldsmith is a part of (he already
expresses these doubts in Soliloquy), but, so be it -- for both Goldsmith
and/or Perloff.

As to the manifesto-like force, let’s say, of Perloff’s oeuvre to date
(since I’ve mentioned her once, I'll keep using her as my example), for the
import of modernism and for a specific vector in it, for a certain reading
of “progress” in literary form over the last century up to the present, and
relation to the political and social, etc., it may nudge a bit a poet’s
to-do list of books to read, insofar as the poet in question reads Perloff,
but that’s about it, is my guess.

Blackwell publishers has released a new critical series, Manifestos, written
by a range of (presumably all) academics, including but not limited to
literary critics, from differing ideological camps. I don’t see a problem
with academics -- or with anyone else, for that matter – taking on the
manifesto genre if it helps articulate a particular juncture of debate in a
given domain.

Guess #4: "The poetry scene does not reproduce status issues. It is free, in
other words, not only of back-biting, snobbery, ambition, and general
nastiness, but also of cameraderie, self-reflexive attention to differences
of position, and selflessness. All that is a plague of the academy." If you
think status in the academy is fiercely reproduced to the disadvantage of
all, you don’t know poetry scenes at times, and fail to even catch the
sometimes satiric (and otherwise) tones in some lines of poetry that refer
to other poetry and poets.

If, instead, you’re lamenting the direction that issues of poetry
status-making has taken, namely towards academic acceptance (in some sense),
then even there I don’t think you’re addressing the larger issue of poets in
relation to social institutions as such (not just academic institutions).

By the way, are you editor of The Chicago Review, or is that another Andrew
Rathmann?

Guess #5: Suspend guessing, Louis! Ask Andrew! Andrew, if you gave a
specific example of “the kind of mannerist writing that starts to appear”
from pronouncements by Professor X, where “eventually someone proposes an
MLA panel on it,” that would help me, at any rate; otherwise, I feel lost in
listspace, as to what you are referring to, because your post is
self-admittedly general.

Hey Louis, (and eventually Andrew too!)

I think your oost is interesting too!  Intentional swerve and/or typo
creating the word oost makes me think of propulsion, push, ouvre, etc.  I
get the oost.  um...

>The manifesto form was never an exclusively literary genre (nor did
>it begin as one), even when it claimed to be that.

So can the manifesto be claimed or categorized into a capital M genre of
writing?  It seems to have become diffuse throughout philosophies of
poetry/poetics, so that now any statement of poetics reads much like a
manifesto (even if only for the moment of its inception).  Something like
'Writing and Method' by Charles Bernstein for example, or Lyn Hejinian's
'Rejection of Closure.'  And if it is classed as a genre, then does it lose
relevance simply by being a Manifesto?

(from Andrew's post:)
>"The poetry scene does not reproduce status issues. It is free, in
>other words, not only of back-biting, snobbery, ambition, and general
>nastiness, but also of cameraderie, self-reflexive attention to differences
>of position, and selflessness. All that is a plague of the academy."

What poetry scene?  And what poetry scene is free from competitive jealousy
and infighting?  There was no inbiting going on outside of Academia, in a
utopian poetry world free from competition and progressivity?  Back-biting,
snobbery, ambition, and general nastiness happen in board rooms all over the
world.  Are you sure that the injection of these things is a result of the
academy, or is it a result of the specialization and progressivity that has
been bred into us through capitalism, or maybe it has something to do with a
fierce desire for mangoes....

mangifestoes...

yup that's about two cents there.

I like the spirit here.  The idea that the poetry scene is pristine, free
from human foibles, that the academy is to blame, is the goofiest yet.
Jealous people who cheat, back-bite, manipulate are people of low character.
No one is forcing them to behave this way.  Certainly not the academy.  Blame
their parents.  Best, Bill

I thought this was a Poetics List.  So how come all this fiction.  Even the
most cursory knowledge of the academy reveals that those who "really succeed"
are those who buck the system.  Like the tribe of poststructuralist
philosophers and literary critics who ran up against New Criticism's brick
wall and took it apart piece by piece.  Like the New Critics before them who
waged a similar battle against the impressionists.  Those at the forefront of
such movements become the superstars, the ones who "really succeed."   Not
the least of their accomplishments is the ongoing violation of what is
considered proper and acceptable discourse.  Sure, one can make it to full
professor at a midlevel college by doing the conventional thing, but that is
not "really succeeding," is it?  Of course not.  That is nothing more than
having a career.  Sure there is resistance.  That's good.  Any institution
worth a dime requires that the new thing prove itself.  What's could possibly
be the alternative?  That someone announces his "new and brilliant method"
and everyone drops to their knees?

I don't know the above poster well enough to judge motives, so I won't.  But
let's be honest.  There are a lot of jealous people who think their "wild
thing" is pure genius, and anyone who doesn't recognize it as such must be
some sort of Capitalist puppet on a string.  The truth is that much, if not
most, of what goes on within, and without, the academy is derivative duck
tape.  The bona fide innovative act is still as rare as fairy dust.

The poster is certainly correct to point out that certain "techniques"
achieve critical mass and influence the classroom.  But that is obviously a
tribute to the power of the innovation, and the innovator.  But no one stops
anyone from teaching however one wants to teach.  There is a little thing
called academic freedom.  It's been around for a long time.  Most of us have
heard of it.

By the way, these "professionally approved ways of talking about literature"
-- what might they be?  Best, Bill

Jason (and to query Bill),


1. Perhaps the general nastiness whereof you speak began with the emergence
of a world market somewhere in the 16C. God forbid!

I’d put the whole status thing down -- from the corporate board room to The
Drawing Room -- to a fierce desire for mangoes, then.

Don't you like magoes?


2. I wonder if the book Joe Brennan references, The Vehement Passions,
stakes any importance for that same historical moment as one that newly
“articulates” the human passions to newly-emergent social ends, anger, etc,
sublimated (say) and substituted with the friendlier faces of “moods” and
“feelings,” in order to further the fourth estate, the bourgeoisie and its
public sphere of “universal” values enacted according to the enlightenment
principle of reason, and the drives for self-improvement and successful
profit.

Or, maybe that’s by now a story no one cares to tell once more.

(Afraid of another beating.)

2a. It’s interesting to think about the role Spinoza’s system of passions
had (see his Ethics) for Zukofsky, perhaps helping the poet sublimate and
align his passions under the domestic star of Love instead of Lenin, as
compensation for how appallingly absent he was from the poetry and
publishing scenes for most of his life (and for how appallingly bad his
literary friend, one E. Pound, treated him at times). Zukofsky read Spinoza
a lot. Spinoza rationalizes the passions in a modernizing direction far more
than Descartes did -- and is in fact a precursor for Freud’s unworked-out
concept of sublimation.

I’m writing about this in what is called a Ph.D. dissertation -- in what is
called another temporal dimension than this one.


3. God forbid that this listserv become a “fifth stomach” for the digestion
of Langpo in the peripheral outbacks of American globalized monopoly
culture!!

That is to say, I don’t think of the two texts you reference as being
manifestos.

a. A manifesto doesn’t need an “argument.”

As you know, some literary classics of the genre claimed to dispense with
reason altogether (e.g. Tzara’s).


4. To think of the manifesto as a genre would be to trace changes in the
history of a social institution.

So Foucault would say. So too would Blackwell!

191 E. Toole Ave., Tucson
NW Corner of Toole and 6th Ave. in downtown Tucson
Suggested Donation: $5 admission / $3 students

Workshop Times: Sunday, May 19, 1:00–2:25 pm (Lisa Jarnot), 2:35–4:00 pm
(Ron Silliman)
Location: MOCA (Museum of Contemporary Art)
Participation fee: $10 for one workshop or $15 for both workshops.

Presented by POG, CHAX PRESS, MOCA, and TUCSON WRITERS’ PROJECT.
Supported by funding from Tucson Pima Arts Council and Arizona Commission on
the Arts.

Please call Chax Press at 620-1626 for information.

LISA JARNOT’s books include Some Other Kind of Mission and Ring of Fire. She
is currently a faculty member at Naropa University’s Jack Kerouac School of
Disembodied Poetics.

Author of Xing, Demo to Ink, and many more books, RON SILLIMAN merges the
acrobatics of language poetry with a personal voice that brings his words
close to everyday experience. The Alphabet, a 1200-page work, “seeks to
include as much of the world as possible, especially those aspects that are
least likely to be seen, heard, or recognized.”

        This is a test.
        The hammer of birds (rabbits) secure in the deficit garden, fog along the
coast.
Water hammer, rock board — recurrence as key in phlegmatic analysis
(fellaheen hurdling custard
pie into the face of Bette Midler).
        Friends are perpetually “going to get it together,” jobwise: the coast is
altered one quarter inch.
        Just like that.
                        Ron Silliman
                          from Demo to Ink


I am bludgeoned by this most exotic ocean, currently, I am in the post
office with the prison cells and tides, I am with the fires in the
eucalyptus fog, I am clearing and the colors are all changing, I am changing
colors in the lift of fog, I am almost to Japan, I am circles and the
squirrels revolve, I am missing plastic pets, I am predictions of the sounds
of tides and this.
                         Lisa Jarnot

These events take place at MOCA during MOCA’s exhibition of paintings and
sculpture by Harmony Hammond, titled Dialogues & Meditations. The basement
gallery of MOCA is showing paintings and installations by Gwyneth Scally.

I'm only an occasional academic, and thank god I haven't had to deal with
academic politics for many years, but I can still recognize the
disingenuous.. I was at Johns Hopkins when the French department became an
uunhealthy environment for anyone that didn't agree with Rene Girard--over
the course of three or four years all dissidents left and were replaced by
more agreeable new hires. People sure are told how and what to teach, if
indirectly. The same was largely true at the much larger Columbia English
department, where I wound up next. I say largely, because Said was there.
Aside from him it was the Trilling legacy, which is why I stayed in 1800
and earlier.  These are not unique experiences. Departments are regularly
wracked by civil wars  about excatly what should be taught and how.

Sometimes very dubious ideas in their shallowest form become dominant. The
power of innovation. Try reading 40 years of psychoanalytic
overinterpretation. The market is not the best of peer reviews.

Lit departments at least don't kill people. Med schools have had similar
crazes, leaving a trail of the dead and wounded. Remember lobotomies? Must
have been the power of innovation.  Or maybe, as in interpretive crazes,
we're dealing with the understandable frustration of not knowing how to
deal with, in medicine, the unmendable, in literature, the difficult to
grasp. And of course the building of fiefdoms.

I'm a publisher, art dealer and poet. My motives have nothing to do with
the baser passions, whatever the previous poster's motivations. I really
don't care how much junk is taught and published in the academic mills
except when I'm researching (although I'm amused every two weeks to note
how many of the new books advertized in NYRB are "essential" or the like.
The essential doesn't tend to happen with semimonthly regularity). I do
care that so little of it is written out of passion, right or wrong-headed,
for scholarship, and I wonder why to teach in  a comfortable
institution  young people are conditioned to that sort of dishonesty.

But it's as a poet that I'm most concerned. I've been through a few
professional cultures, and I know that one very quickly, if painfully,
retrains to become a part of that culture. If poetry is a product of the
whole of what one has to  bring to the poem a poetry written by those who
have spent their entire educational and professional lives within the
constraints of a professional culture will necessarily be impoverished.
Which is maybe fine--we all live under sets of constraints. The problem I
think is that more and more is written within the same sets of constraints.
If we were talking about other organisms we would worry about the threat of
too narrow a range of genetic variation.

great question. I have several questions I'll save for later, but I'm
very curious to know what are the "unapproved" ways? I'm always
looking for new ideas for the classroom. Seriously. Thanks.

> Dear Andrew---

    While there's something in me sympathetic to this self-proclaimed "rant,"
     I wonder how you define the terms--
     By focussing on ACADEMIC criticism as the bogey man to be ignored
     you seem to imply there's a non-academic criticism that
     poets (presumably also non-academic) either don't have to, or shouldn't,
ignore.
     That academic=professional and non-academic is somehow free of that.

   Is that really the case? Since "academic," whether used pejoratively or not,

     can refer both to "Criticism" and "poetry" (the Ph.D. vs. MFA thing)
     just as non-academic can (for instance, when you accepted that long
     10 page review I had written of Jennifer Moxley's "Imagination Verses"
      for publication in the Chicago Review---for which I'm grateful,
      and I hope you don't mind me mentioning it--it's the best relevant
      example can think of--, there was concern, if I remember correctly,
      that it wouldn't sit well with the other editors unless we made some
      slight cosmetic changes so it seemed more like an "academic essay"
      but was the essay really "academic"? Was the discourse really
      "acceptable" as, say, the discourse of, say, Sianne Ngai, Lytle Shaw,
      Steve Evans, or Juliana Spahr is said to be? How does one then
      determine what "academically acceptable discourse" is? Or WHO
      determines it? One may bend "the rules" or try to change them
      from below or within, but as one who has had at least 3 essays
      accepted by editors of academic books only to have them later,
      all, rejected by "anonymous" readers hired by the university presses,
      I too have little hope for this, and it makes me skeptical to what does
      get published as "academic criticism." So, there is a range of related
questions
      that you open up here that would need to be explored.

      At the same time, however, and more importantly I think, I want to
      turn some of your righteous questioning of academic professionalism
      on itself, not exactly "on its head" (although Louis Cabri claims that
      the chicken-egg thing is my dominant characteristic poetic mode or
      something) and claim that much of what you claim to be the process
     involved in legitimizing the academic is at least as true, and in some
     cases maybe even MORE true of poets themselves, whether or not
     they work within the academy.

     So, if I take these first several sentences, for instance--

> >The academic's first problem is how to advance professionally.  To get and
> >keep a job, the academic must produce an acceptable discourse.  Not great,
> >not even very good, just acceptable.  This means sticking to certain
> >categories -- cliches, really -- that other academics will recognize and
> >condone.

and if I substitute the word "poet" (or even "writer") for the word "academic"
and substitute "advance professionally" for "get one's work published," it
may seem absurd---certainly, some might object, that wouldn't be the "first"
problem
of any self-respecting poet (to which I respond, well, then, hopefully, it
isn't
the FIRST problem of the academic either, unless of course we assume that
the academic isn't really interested in teaching in a classroom). So, then we'd

have to substitute the word "verse" for "discourse." And, I think this
substition becomes less and less absurd, if I take a look at the vast majority
of poetry that seems to be written in certain codes (for instance, the "New
Obscurantists" valorizing the lyric "fragment" or the "Plain-Speaking"
workshop syllabics) that certain editors of magazines or "more established"
writers will recognize or condone.

> So, when you say:

> >This does not mean that all academic criticism is bad, just that there are
> >distorting forces at work.

I say this does not mean tht all contemporary poetry is bad, just that there
 are distorting forces are work....
 and that free-verse ain't always as free as it's cracked up to be....
 and, then, the question is, is "free-verse" even a value?
 And what is the point of all the "excellent scribbling in a period style?"

> The annoying outcome is that those who really succeed within the system
> >know only the professionally approved ways of talking about literature.
>

and talking IN literature; even those who often claim they're "too pure"
to be bothered with even trying to explain what they're doing, or why
they might be doing it (especially, if they just won another "non-academic"
Book prize/grant, etc.). Professionalism does not equal academicism,
so what to do about it?

Au contraire un peu: those will full time jobs will never leave ever the rest

kind words and thanks...

worth noting, perhaps, that "A Wild Salience" was published by a private
rather than academic press.  also that some of the cross-currents noted in
this thread here evidenced as points of contention during the production of
that book.  and that, largely as a result of that contention (coupled with
cash losses bourne by an individual rather than an institution) the
publisher is now indefinately on haitus...

Dear Chris,

May I raise an objection to your anatomization of Louis Cabri's claim that
Andrew Rathman had failed to be clear in his proposal that the field
is in crisis (and thus, I take it, pooh- pooh the crisis)?

For methinks I'm staring a class issue straight in the face.  Let's just
call academic criticism "credentializing publication" and leave it at that
-- yes?  And let's not problematize the relation of prose criticism to
verse and look for more theoretically rigorous definitions when folks like
Andrew (I'm guessing, don't know him) are looking for jobs and asking -- I
thought -- very good questions about the nature of his own vocation (poet)
to the profession (a Univ. English dept?). Heck, I'm just getting off
year-one on the job market during which I drudged at 4-4-2 @ $22,000, so
I'm not sure all our good theory has led to the reform Charles Bernstein
seems to think I ought to read about in his new book.

Am I being clear yet?  Which part do we need to explain?  In St. Louis was
recently started an MFA program.  The tenured faculty at this particular
burb teach 2-2 and probably "service" 20-30 students a semester, many in
the kind of creative writing classes that most flatter their sense of
themselves.  The job we all want, right?  Who pays for that kind of
luxury?  Oh, yes, there are others there teaching more, "servicing" many
more, and these seem to think (hard to tell, they're not "clear") the
field is in crisis, perhaps because those who are tenured continue to
admit and graduate 8 bright and shining, credential-aspirant MFAs a year,
many of these offered jobs over those with PhDs, perhaps PhDs who actually
care enough about their criticism/scholarship to want to write "academic
criticism" that's not merely credentializing. I don't suppose one has to
be Cary Nelson to understand that this isn't a healthy situation.

I just resigned my job, by the way.  I'll give it another year on the
market to see what's up -- lucky enough to have a wife who can earn some
bread while I do -- but I'm entirely in sympathy with Andrew.  Aren't we
denying something here?

Jeff

Hell, academic critics have been ignoring poets for at least 150 years.

Hi Joel!

Since you've brought this into the realm of the classroom, I thought
I might remind people how students themselves will enforce approved
ways of speaking about literature in the classroom.  For instance, I
sometimes will ask a student about their intention in doing such and
such in a certain piece.  Normally this isn't a problem, but upon
occasion I've had a student tell me that it was wrong of me to ask
questions and that students shouldn't be allowed to discuss their own
work in a writing workshop.  The student is supposed to sit silently
as others discuss it with no input or background info.  When a
student talks about their own work it's interpreted as
defensive--I've seen the most innocent, informative comments
interpreted as defensive.  I even had someone (a college student) say
that people shouldn't be asked questions about their work in my
private workshop in my living room!!!  Normally people bloom in the
riotous, Wild West atmosphere of the private group, but translating
that to an official classroom has to be done very subtly and
carefully.  If something as simple as asking a question can cause
panic in some people, how radical could you expect to get?  Of
course, student openness varies dramatically from school to school,
class to class.

The LEFT HAND READING SERIES closes its 2001-2002 season with a reading
featuring prose writer Kass Fleisher and poet, translator and Left Hand
Reading Series co-host Laura E. Wright....

KASS FLEISHER once sold burial property before cashing out of that and
buying into Mary Kay Cosmetics- but she wrote short fictions about those
experiences, which makes it ok.  While working as a theatrical ballet
producer, she once met Baryshnikov, who, in flip-flops, was no taller than
her left breast.  Her prose works have never been described as "gossamer,"
but she has been accused of bleating the same feminist plaints over and
over
and over.  Since patriarchy remains firmly intact, this last isn't slowing
her down any- in her spare time she has founded an organization called the
Postfeminist Backlash Resistance League.  Beginning in 2003, the PBRL will
meet annually to bestow awards to Best-Dressed-Assimilationists (she is
currently accepting nominations for BDAs at kass.fleisher@colorado.edu).
Meanwhile, she has published work in Antennae, Calypso, electronic book
review, Exquisite Corpse, The Iowa Review and Postmodern Culture.

LAURA E. WRIGHT is an insomniac, a poet, a member of the School of
Continuation, and an avid hockey fan. Her writing has appeared
(relatively)
recently in Facture and Mantis.  Anselm Hollo once described her writing
as
"unimproved." Her favorite word in French is "bla bla" and her favorite
word
in English is "chicken."


=====================================================


There will be a short OPEN READING immediately before the featured
readings.
  Sign up for the Open Reading will take place promptly at 8:00 p.m.


=====================================================


The LEFT HAND READING SERIES is an independent series presenting readings
of
original literary works by emerging and established writers.  Founded in
1996, the series is currently curated by poets MARK DuCHARME and LAURA
WRIGHT.  Readings in the series are presented monthly.  This reading marks
the end of the Left Hand Reading Series 2001-2002 season, and also marks
the beginning of a leave of absence from the series for Mark DuCharme.
The
Left Hand Reading Series will resume in some form or other in the future.

I had Nathalie Handal and some of these poets from 'The Poetry of Arab
Women: A Contemporary Anthology' on as guests a few months back - I have a
recording of the night they did at Beyond Baroque that I edited and burned
to a CD and can send it to you or upload it to you if you have server space
- either as .aiff or as .mp3.  Let me know if you'd like this.

The anthology is wonderful and has an amazing scope, both from the
countries where the women write from and from the diversity of their
educational backgrounds and idea of poetics.

Jordan Elgrably from the Levantine Center has been setting up these types
of events here in Los Angeles and could probably provide more extensive
info on Arab Poets.  Levantine Center is new, basically it's purpose is to
promote Arab Culture to open up a window on the region that's not
necessarily political.  He would probably be able to hook you up with
Nathalie or her publicist.  She travels quite a bit and may even live in
New York...

He's at:

I am also having a guest sometime in June - Majid Naficy, a Palestinian
Poet.  At the end of this e-mail is a very good article that the LA Weekly
wrote on him.

Poet of the Revolution
Majid Naficy's tragic journey home

by Louise Steinman


Why do I speak in poetry?
Because in this heavy mist,
I cannot be a lighthouse
=46or drifting boats.

THE BACK DOOR TO MAJID NAFICY'S MODEST SANTA Monica apartment is open. The
aroma of sweet and sour wafts in from a Chinese hole-in-the-wall across the
parking lot. A clay pot full of fresh mint sits on the railing of the small
patio. On his bookcase shelves, well-worn volumes in Farsi and a few in
English, including Walt Whitman and a Hebrew-English dictionary. On an old
desk there's an enlargement device that allows the nearly blind poet to
magnify text 60 times so that he can read. Az=E2d, Majid's 12-year-old son,
is at school -- but he has left behind ample evidence of an American
boyhood: skateboard, baseball mitt, Pok=E9mon cards, sneakers, a Michael
Jordan poster taped to the refrigerator.

Majid is a political refugee from Iran, where he was an active participant
in the revolution against the shah. He lost his first wife, Ezzat, his
brother Sa'id, his brother-in-law Hossein, numerous friends and,
ultimately, his country to the death squads of Ayatollah Khomeini's
fundamentalist Islamic regime.

On the table, there's a framed, faded black-and-white photograph: a young
unveiled woman with a heart-shaped face and a shy, serious expression.
"This is Ezzat," Majid says tenderly, as if introducing someone physically
present. He has described this photo in a poem, "To a Picture":


I see you in the middle of the garden
The red roses have covered your skirt.
You seem to be standing on tiptoe
To get a better view of the other side.
Alas, you fell down in the execution field
And my body did not cover you
How short was the landscape of the other side!
But our love still stands upright.

The edge of the picture is torn. "Ezzat's mother used to be in the photo,"
he says, "but I promised her that I would cut her out." There are no photos
of Majid and his first wife together. They both lived underground in the
dangerous years following the 1979 revolution. "We did not want the secret
police to recognize us," he says.

I first encountered Majid at a "Writing in Exile" conference sponsored by
Villa Aurora in 1995. The Villa, an artists' residence and cultural center
in Pacific Palisades, is now maintained by the German Foreign Office and
the Goethe-Institut. The former residence of novelist Leon Feuchwanger, a
Jewish-German refugee, it's now dedicated to preserving the memory of
writers who fled the Nazis, and to other exiled peoples. At the conference,
Majid read from one of his essays. I was impressed with the sense of
authority he projected, his quiet intensity, his keen insights into the
painful experience of leaving behind one's native tongue, one's family,
one's history: "My body lives in L.A., but my soul is still rummaging
through the ruins of a lost revolution back in Iran."

In 1999, Beyond Baroque Literary Center published Muddy Shoes, Majid's
first collection of poems translated into English. Soon after, Majid read
from his work at the downtown Central Library (where I program the reading
series). Az=E2d sat in the front row of the auditorium, swinging his legs,
busy with his Gameboy. Majid walked to the stage of the Mark Taper
Auditorium. A small tape recorder hung from a strap around his neck. He put
on earphones and pressed the "start" button. Until then, few in the
audience realized that Majid, who doesn't use a cane, is legally blind. He
never glanced down at a page, but instead prompted himself with his own
voice, his calm, uninflected phrases following the rise and fall of his
breath on tape. The audience was mesmerized.

His poems were indeed rummaging through the ruins of the lost revolution,
places with names like the Cemetery of Infidels, Evin Prison, the Tower of
Silence. History and the sad weight of personal and cultural loss were
compressed into haunting lyrics: "I don't want you, petroleum!/Oh, bloody
stream! For a long time,/I thought you gave me blood./Now I see, you made
me bleed."

In Iran, this gentle, soft-spoken, middle-aged poet had been an ardent
revolutionary. When asked for an interview, he was slightly incredulous:
"Haven't you read my poems? My life is already an open book." Nevertheless,
over the course of several weeks, he patiently attempted to describe to me
his experience of the 1979 revolution he so fervently worked for, the
revolution that so spectacularly failed, the revolution that ended up
turning so many lives upside down and inside out.

MAJID WAS BORN IN ISFAHAN, AS HE PUTS IT, "ONE year before the CIA coup in
1953," the ominous event that toppled Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh,
who had nationalized Iran's oil industry. Initiated by Britain and approved
by President Eisenhower because of fears about oil and communism, the
CIA-orchestrated coup brought Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi to power. Thanks
to a recently leaked CIA report (excerpts of which were published in The
New York Times), Americans can now read for themselves how, by deposing a
still-popular nationalist leader and installing the despotic shah, the U.S.
government short-circuited an evolving democratic process and indirectly
set the stage for the 1979 Islamic takeover of Iran. "There are no
shortcuts in history," Majid said soberly during one of our sessions at his
kitchen table. "I believe in that. If you think you can take a shortcut,
you have to pay a price for it. And that's what we're suffering from now.
When there is no civil society, the group of people that comes to power --
however good-intentioned they are -- ends up becoming dictators
themselves."

Isfahan, a city nearly as old as Iran itself, is world-renowned for its
architectural beauty. I found a book on Isfahan and leafed through the
glorious images: the central bridge with 33 arches over the Zayandeh River;
blue-tiled mosques with vaulted archways and towering minarets; the Palace
of the 40 Columns, with its long reflecting pool lined with rosebushes; the
vast central plaza, twice as large as Moscow's Red Square; the Palace of
Ali Qapu ("sublime gate"), Iran's first skyscraper; the 17th-century Imam
Mosque, with acoustics so perfect, according to L.A. Times Middle East
correspondent Robin Wright, that "stomping on the black paving stones
beneath the dome generates a ripple of seven equal echoes."

The Isfahan of Majid's childhood was a tolerant city, Jewish, Armenian and
Ba'hai communities mingling with the majority Muslims. It was also a city
that was mixing, for the first time, modern with ancient -- fumes from the
Soviet-built metallurgy plant collided with the fragrance of cherry trees
in spring. The Naficy family was large (nine children, five boys and four
girls) and relatively affluent. Majid's father, a cardiologist trained in
Tehran and the United States, is a seventh-generation physician in a family
lineage extending back to the 14th century. His mother was a religious
woman who preferred to wear the veil =E2 in public even though, under the
shah, it had been banned. His parents were both peaceful people. "My father
gave me a sense of being curious," says Majid, "in terms of books and
different cultures. He took us to all different parts of Iran. My mother
was very kind. She gave us a sense of how to know other people, and she was
always optimistic."

Majid's talent for poetry was recognized at an early age; his first poem
was published in a literary journal in Isfahan when he was only 13, thanks
to a poet who was the teacher of his older brother. This teacher, who
edited the journal, invited the young prot=E9g=E9 to the literary salons tha=
t
rotated among the houses of Isfahan's various writers. This was a
considerable honor in a country with a rich literary and cultural past,
where people revere great poets and plant luxuriant gardens around their
tombs. Fortunately for Majid, his extreme nearsightedness was also
discovered at an early age: "I was 5 years old, sitting in a room with my
uncle, who asked me to turn on the light. I looked up and I couldn't see
the switch. So the first summer before I went to first grade, I wore
eyeglasses. It was very unusual for a child to have eyeglasses, especially
in Isfahan. Perhaps that is what made me feel separate from the crowd."

Life in Isfahan among his large family made possible a childhood that even
now conjures pleasant memories. There was a grape arbor in the back yard;
he was close with his siblings, especially his sisters, and confided in
them. From the shelves of the huge library -- some 3,000 volumes -- that
his family had collected over the years, the young poet selected his first
long novel, Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

Yet even a young child sheltered by a loving family could see the evidence
of a cruel regime. A memory from age 6: "My school class was taken in the
early morning to watch the shah pass by in a parade. We had to stand in the
street a long time. It was very cold. When the shah passed in his special
car, a man tried to reach his window -- to give him an envelope, perhaps a
complaint. Two guards rushed forward and beat the man with their ceremonial
swords. This made a deep impression on me."

As he grew older, the oppressive presence of SAVAK, the shah's secret
police, filtered into all aspects of daily life. Citizens could be
imprisoned for any imagined slight against the government. In the shah's
dungeons, torture was routine. At the same time as he was forcefully
modernizing the country, fattening the military, importing specialists from
abroad to build his "Great Civilization," the shah was silencing the most
enlightened Iranians. Intellectual discourse was stifled. Over the years,
there was increasingly heavy censorship of films, newspapers, books and
fiction. In 1969, the shah dissolved the Iranian Writers' Organization.

The year after he graduated from high school in Isfahan, Majid came to
California to study. UCLA, like other American campuses, was at the time
roiled by protests against the war in Vietnam. It was Majid's first
exposure to democratic protest, and he was impressed by the vigor of young
Americans' opposition to the war. At UCLA, he also met other Iranians,
members of the Iranian student confederation that opposed the shah's
government. Their Marxism rubbed off on him. "I'd been an existentialist,"
he tells me. "A conscious existentialist who was very influenced by Sartre.
I read existential books which criticized Marxism, but when I came here,
because of the situation of exile, and because a new radical movement was
taking shape in Iran, I became very involved with what we called the
urban-guerrilla movement."

At the end of that year, Majid transferred to Tehran University and
committed himself to the movement to overthrow the shah. The newly minted
Marxist revolutionary was not just opinionated, he was -- as he now
describes -- "self-righteous, intolerant of others' beliefs." He vowed not
to write poetry again "until the liberation of the proletariat." "I
criticized my poetry as a petit-bourgeois part of my life," he says. "I was
not alone. Many intellectuals in Iran went that way. When the guerrilla
movement started in the 1970s, it polarized the intelligentsia. Some of
them were subsidized by the government, and some of them joined the armed
opposition movement." Majid's own brother Sa'id was arrested by SAVAK in
1973. His family was tipped off that their house would be raided; aunts,
uncles and cousins split up the library, distributing the 3,000 volumes in
basements and closets all over Isfahan.

IN 1977, MAJID MET EZZAT TABAIAN, FIVE YEARS HIS junior, a student of
physiotherapy at Tehran University. "The first thing we did together was to
organize a protest on campus," he says. "To control the students, SAVAK had
set a curfew on the women's dormitory. There were guards everywhere on
campus. The women could not get in or go out of their residence after 8
p.m." Majid and Ezzat made large posters calling for a protest, and posted
them around campus. The ensuing demonstration was a success: The curfew was
rescinded.

Ezzat and Majid became inseparable and soon married. In 1978, just a year
before the revolution, the couple traveled around Iran to villages and
factories to organize workers and write about the socioeconomic situation.
Majid translated and edited a book about women's liberation as well as a
Marxist critique of existentialism, both banned by the censors. Around that
time, their political group, Peykar, broke with strict Marxist ideology.
"We decided that armed struggle was not right. The masses have to make
revolution."

By January 1979, the shah had fled the country. There was a brief, sudden
state of freedom, but the revolution was soon hijacked by the extreme
right, and hope of real democracy fast faded. "I condemn the corrupt
intellectuals and the poisoned pens of conspiring writers and democrats,"
Ayatollah Khomeini declared soon after his victory. During the terror that
ensued, thousands of intellectuals were executed or arrested. Majid and
Ezzat went underground, using false identification and living in a safe
house. Majid, as a key member of Peykar's "theoretical team," continued to
write, edit and produce a monthly underground publication for the
organization.

One afternoon during the fall of 1981, Majid waited at the Shadabad bus
station in Tehran for a 5 p.m. rendezvous with his wife. Five p.m. passed,
6 p.m. passed, but Ezzat did not appear, nor would she ever appear again.
She had already been captured and sent to Evin Prison. In his essay,
"Prison Letters: A Look in the Correspondence of an Iranian Political
Prisoner," Majid wrote, "I remember that on precisely January 7, 1982, I
felt that the heart of Ezzat, my late wife who had been detained for four
months, was no longer beating, and when two days later I heard by telephone
the news of her execution, I was not surprised. The prison walls were not
able to separate our hearts."

Disguised as a shopkeeper with a derby and beard, he sneaked into the
Cemetery of Infidels, where the Khomeini regime buried its executed
opponents in a series of fresh, unmarked graves. Families of the deceased
located the graves by measuring paces. Majid found it eight steps before
the gate and 16 steps from the wall. Ezzat had been buried with one other
woman and 50 men, all of whom had been executed together.

In the wake of his wife's murder, the poetry returned. "It was winter," he
says. "There was snow on the big mountains around Tehran. I'd gone up to
the mountains with friends to commemorate Ezzat. When we came down, I went
to the safe house. I sat down, and all of a sudden poetry came back to me.
'I must create her again,' I thought. 'I must take revenge on her killers.'
I wrote nine poems in one sitting. I hadn't written poetry in eight years.
Now I know how those cavemen felt when they drew those bulls on the walls
of caves. You want to create what was lost. It gives you energy -- for
hunting, for magic. It's when you feel powerless against reality, that's
when art comes to you."

Eight months after Ezzat's execution, Majid met a fellow revolutionary
named Esmat. "We met each other at a very bad time in our lives," he says.
They rented a safe house and lived there together for six months. In April
1983, they fled Iran. With the help of Kurdish guerrillas, they traveled
seven days by horseback over the border from Iran into Turkey, moving only
by night to minimize detection. Majid carried very little with him: the
nine poems for Ezzat he'd written the day he came down from the mountain,
some money, an Afghani passport, a photo of his brother Sa'id, and the torn
photograph of Ezzat as a teenager in her garden in Isfahan -- the one that
sits on the table of his Santa Monica apartment today.

After a year-and-a-half stay in Turkey and France, Majid successfully
applied for political asylum in the United States. "I considered France my
second homeland, but my eyesight was failing and I already knew English
very well." Settling in Venice with Esmat, who became his second wife and
the mother of his son -- now divorced, they remain good friends -- he
re-dedicated himself to his vocation as a poet and commenced a period of
intense soul-searching. Where had his ideological thinking led him? Where
had it led his country? "I said to myself, 'Ezzat is dead. The revolution
is defeated. Okay. But now, what do you want to do with your life? You have
to start a new life.'"

He started from scratch, first rethinking and criticizing Marx, then
looking squarely at his own culture. "I started to see what had happened,
because both the left and the right -- both religionists and atheists --
admired getting killed, and killing. We wanted to change the regime, no
matter what came after that. Khomeini used the religious feelings of people
to his advantage. He mixed death worship, or martyrdom worship, with
political ideals." Majid's re-examination yielded a book-length collection
of essays, written in Persian, with the self-revealing title In Search of
Joy: A Critique of Male-Dominated, Death-Oriented Culture in Iran.

There was still plenty of death to reckon with. The Iran-Iraq war was
claiming thousands of Iran's young men. In September 1987, about 800
members of L.A.'s large Iranian community (there are 600,000 Iranians now
estimated to be living in Los Angeles) gathered outside the Federal
Building to protest a visit to the United Nations by the president of Iran.
It was at this demonstration that Neusha Farahi, a friend of Majid's who
owned a Persian bookstore, also in Westwood, set fire to himself as the
ultimate act of protest. He died 13 days later. "I touched his hand while
we waited for the paramedics," Majid recalls, wincing. "It was like a burnt
chicken wing." When he came home that same afternoon, Majid wrote "The
Self-Immolation of Neusha," lamenting the seduction of martyrdom. It
contains the lines:


The crowd cried in fury
Trying to gain strength from death.
I told myself,
"Again a corpse in front.
Again a casket behind."
Alas!
We were guardians of life,
But the guardians of death killed so much.
Killed so much.
Killed so much.
So that life tasted of death in our mouths.

IT'S A HOT SUMMER NIGHT IN LOS ANGELES, AND it's Majid's turn to host the
monthly gathering of "Saturday Notebooks." This Persian literary group has
been meeting together for 10 years, and they have published three chapbooks
of their work. Majid's small apartment has been transformed: Twenty people
-- men and women -- crowd into his living room. Everyone has brought
something to read and critique, as well as something to eat. There is a
vase of pale-pink roses, bowls of fresh basil and mint leaves, hummus,
peaches, plums. Chicken-and-squash stew simmers on the stove. The scheduled
start time is 7 p.m., but participants straggle in late from a
demonstration at the Federal Building, commemorating the one-year
anniversary of the government crackdown on pro-reform =E2 student
demonstrations in Tehran.

As the session finally gets under way, Majid asks for a moment of silence
in memory of his dear friend Houshang Golshiri, one of Iran's greatest
fiction writers and a prominent advocate of human rights, who has recently
died in Tehran. Everyone stands, heads bowed.

Even to a guest with zero comprehension of Farsi, plenty is communicated
over the next several hours. All these writers bring seriousness and
passion to their work. When your colleagues at home are being arrested,
imprisoned, even murdered, for their exercise of free expression, the right
to exchange words and ideas is not a privilege you take for granted. I
can't help stealing glances at the man sitting beside me, who is missing
the ring finger on his right hand. Later, Majid confirms my hunch: This
writer lost his finger during a torture session in one of the shah's
prisons.

Around 10 p.m., the group pauses for supper. I heap onto my plate some of
Majid's stew. "Delicious!" I comment to one of the writers. He sidles
closer. "Actually," he confides, "Majid is a much better poet than he is a
cook." He takes another mouthful himself. "And he is a most wonderful
father."

AZ=E2D AND HIS BUDDY DAVID ZOOM in the front door of the apartment on their
shiny scooters. Az=E2d is a robust, handsome kid with meltingly beautiful
dark eyes. He is not shy. To the time-honored question of "What do you want
to be when you grow up?" Az=E2d has a ready, earnest answer: "I don't want t=
o
have poetry for a job when I grow up. I'd like to be a basketball player or
a baseball player." What does he think of his father's poetry? His eyes
light up. He grins at his dad. "My favorite is 'Secret of the River.' My
dad wrote it for me. I've read it to my class at school." Before heading
out the door with his friend, he does something I've never known a
12-year-old boy to do. He recites a poem from memory:


Every day we go along the river
And your body
Takes on the smell of the water.

Seeing us, the wild geese
Tune up their battle horns,
And a cat behind its green hideout
Lifts his tail in triumph.
The old fishermen,
With their buckets full of sorrow
Move from place to place
And a palm frond in our way
=46orces me to bend my head.

I stand still.
And as you sleep on my shoulder
I think to myself:
"It's too late for me
But maybe you will find
The secret of the river."
CAN MAJID IMAGINE EVER GOING back to Iran? "Only if the government
apologized for what they did," he says emphatically. Isn't that unlikely?
Is there even a precedent? "It's not unprecedented," Majid insists.
"Madeleine Albright recently apologized for what the U.S. did to Iran in
1953, for the CIA coup. It's just like a personal relationship -- if you
want to have a relationship, apology is the first step."

However, he's not holding his breath, for an apology, or for his return. In
the years since receiving asylum, Majid has become an American poet. Editor
Ardavan Daravan, who included Majid's work in an influential anthology of
Iranian-diaspora literature, spent years trying to find significant voices
for his collection. Majid was among those writers, Daravan says, "who had
made the transition . . . who could connect their experiences living abroad
with their original cultural traditions." Fred Dewey of Beyond Baroque
wrote in his foreword to Muddy Shoes that Majid's poetry "is born of great
suffering yet affirms deep dignity and respect for that wider experience of
the world, brought here through danger and carved out of solitude and
reflection. Tragically, we are seldom allowed to hear or see such things,
blocked from sensing the reality of other countries, knowledges, forms of
speech; when these are allowed in, or come in, they are, without recourse,
smoothed out, conquered, if you will, without mercy. Majid, as a poet of
Los Angeles, suggests a new route."

Majid's adopted city has recently adopted one of his poems. At the
intersection of Brooks Avenue and Ocean Front Walk in Venice, where Majid
frequently jogs with Az=E2d on a scooter beside him, the L.A. Recreation and
Parks Department has engraved on a concrete wall a stanza from his long
poem "Ah, Los Angeles." The poem is Majid Naficy's manifesto, one that
proclaims he is no longer in exile.

=20


Ah, Los Angeles!

I accept you as my city,

And after 10 years

am at peace with you.

Waiting without fear

I lean back against the bus post.

And I become lost

In the sounds of your late night.

A man gets off the Blue Bus 1

And crosses to this side

To take RTD 4.

Perhaps he too is coming back

=46rom his nights on campus.

On the way he has sobbed

Into a blank letter.

And he has heard the voice of a woman

With a tropical accent.

On the RTD 4 it rains.

A woman is talking to her umbrella

And a man ceaselessly flushes a toilet.

I told Carlos yesterday,

"Your clanging cart

Wakes me up in the morning."

He collects cans

And wants to go back to Cuba.

=46rom the Promenade

Comes the sound of my homeless man.

He sings sadly

As he plays his guitar.

Where in the world can I hear

The black moaning of the trumpet

Alongside the Chinese chimes?

And see this warm olive skin

Through blue eyes?

The heedless pigeons

Have perched on the empty benches.

They stare at the dinosaur

Who sprays old water on our kids.

Marziyeh sings from afar.

I return, homesick

And I put my feet

On your back.

Ah, Los Angeles!

I feel your blood.

You taught me to get up

And look with love

At my beautiful legs

And along with the marathon

Run on your broad shoulders.

Once I wanted to commit suicide.

I coiled up under my blanket

And was a recluse for two nights.

Then, I turned on the radio,

And I heard the poems of a Russian poet,

Who in a death camp,

Was denied paper

But his wife learned them by heart.

Will Az=E2d read my poems?

On the days that I take him to school,

He sees the bus number from far off.

And makes things easier for me.

At night he stays under the shower

And lets the drops of water

Spray on his young skin.

Sometimes we go to the beach.

He bikes and I skate.

He buys a Pepsi from a machine

And gives me one sip.

Yesterday we went to Romteen's house.

His father is a Parsee from India.

He wore sadra and kusti

While he was painting the house.

On that little stool

He looked like a Zoroastrian

Rowing from Hormuz to Sanjan.

Ah, Los Angeles!

Let me bend down and put my ear

To your warm skin.

Perhaps in you

I will find my own Sanjan.

No, it's not a ship scraping

Against the rocky shore;

It's the rumbling of Blue Bus 8.

I know.

I will get off at Idaho Street

And will pass the shopping carts

Left by the homeless.

I will climb the wooden staircase

And will open the door.

I will start the answering machine

And in the dark

I will wait like a fisherman.

How appropriate that the Hawai`i mac nuts end up scattered beneath The

I'm curious about the political. For all the bickering on the list,
there are many assumptions continually operative at all levels. These
are often so-called political assumptions. These assumptions are
revealed by certain features of the discussion. For example, the
recent use of the word "stalinist" to describe the moderators of this
list is supposed to shock us. Its rhetoric comes with an implied
architecture: the list moderators are the "government" in a sense,
gatekeepers to the public sphere which constitutes the poetics list
community. As a group we tend to admire "freedom fighters" over
"terrorists," or as skilled rhetors one woman's terror becomes
another man's right, etc. etc. I remember when as list moderator I
was sent in to root out a bunch of sneaky terrorists. They called
themselves freedom fighters, but we knew better.

Seriously, the recent manipulations of history in both popular and
local media comprising any  campaign suggest that there is an
operative plan at work. This often unstated plan has a political
dimension, even if it is not reflexive or well considered. Why not
type out direct statements about where people are coming from
politically? How much diversity is there? I wonder if there aren't
any silent Republicans out there. How about Rush Limbaugh fans?
Surely there must be some difference of opinion. Wouldn't it be
useful to get a series of perspectives in play? I'm curious to know
how and where people are locating these expectations.

What are your politics? How does your political orientation inflect
your poetry, your poetry criticism, or your teaching? I realize this
is a big question. Let me give you an example, from Jameson:

"The first business of a Marxist teacher - in whatever field, the
social sciences or the humanities - is clearly to teach Marxism
itself. That means that we first have to have a fairly clear idea of
the fundamental features or concepts of the doctrine, and also, as
I'll show more fully in a moment, a fairly clear sense of the kinds
of unconscious resistance people have to these ideas. For what it's
worth, I'll give my own check list of these features =8A. The basic
ideas that need to be understood for a grasp of Marxism =8A: the
nature, dynamics, and polarizing logic of social class; the labor
theory of value; alienation and commodity reification; the hidden
logic of historical dynamics, most specifically in a relationship to
social revolution, but also in more static situations of domination
or hegemony, national and international; a commitment to the problem
of ideology (but not necessarily to any particular model of it), as
well as to the problem of superstructures, in short, to the whole
problem of the 'determination of consciousness by social being';
finally, a sense of the great overall organizing concept of Marxism
which is the notion of the mode of production, a concept which ought
to end by raising the most urgent issues of the difference between
capitalism and pre-capitalist societies, of the originality or not of
present-day consumer or late monopoly capitalism as against the
classical kind, and of course, last but most important, the possible
nature of socialism or communism as a social formation." ("Marxism
and Teaching" p 31)

Written in the early seventies, and published in a journal edited,
among others, by Bruce Andrews, this doesn't seem like a paragraph
that would get written today, does it? Actually, many academic
arguments are framed in terms of political language much like this
and such positions (which have become somewhat implicit--and that's
my point) dominate the academic marketplace. What was great about
writing like this or of the Syracuse group of a few years ago was its
explicit take on the structures of the field and how certain
behaviors either reproduced certain ideological formations or
overturned them. Another places where this is true is - oddly - in
much of the theory comprising the field of composition and rhetoric.
The book Charles referred to provided one of the only interesting
panels at the recent College Composition and Communication Conference
in Chicago. What interested me there as well as in the above Jameson
quote is the explicit linking of the political to the content of
instruction, which is linked (presumably) to other structures, and
certainly we can raise many issues with the what and the how of what
is being said here. What interests me is the direct statement that
lays bare the notion that the practices are linked. For example, in
her book, Juliana links a theory of anarchism to her conception of
certain reading practices. For me, this instantly makes her critical
work far more valuable to me than her poetry, as much as I may enjoy
that. Regardless of your feelings about the above Jameson quote, or
rather treating is as an example, I'm curious to know how people
relate to this question. I realize this is a kind of academic
question in that I'm primarily interested in the cultural workers
working in academic or other related institutional settings. Poets -
lest they feel excluded and whatnot - might consider this in terms of
their poetry; editors and publishers in terms of their work.

I think we can make use of the list space by getting as many people
to type up paragraphs like the above-a sort of instant anthology of
direct statements (manifests?)- how many people can we encourage to
contribute? (The historical problem with over-posting was that it led
to noise and actually less participation.) Any thoughts?

Brandon, your proposal is very interesting.  On one level what you are
suggesting is what is already being done with citation reports, which
serve as evidence that someone has taken your writing seriously enough to
mention it.

Yes, the sign is a jaded icon, as I tried to say in the paragraph you

Only if the PDF is posted by an individual on his or her own site.  One
benefit of peer review is the opportunity to rewrite/rework one's writing
in response to helpful feedback.  Going on record with an article before
that point would result in more of a listserve format, with the attendant
hesitations concerning quoting etc that were discussed re Watten's request
last week.  One can easily imagine a combination of the two vetting
processes in an online journal: submission, peer review, rewriting,
resubmission, (editing), posting, then the process of reading and rating
you describe.  They could be combined even more if initial submissions
were posted to a site where access was restricted to a set of 'editors'
who had agreed to read and rate/comment within, say, 2 weeks.

An online journal that seems to be working well within a print framework
is Psyart, http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/journal/index.htm.  The final
rating process takes place informally on the listserve.

I had Nathalie Handal and some of these poets from 'The Poetry of Arab
Women: A Contemporary Anthology' on as guests a few months back - I =

a

burned

The anthology is wonderful and has an amazing scope, both from the
countries where the women write from and from the diversity of their
educational backgrounds and idea of poetics.

Jordan Elgrably from the Levantine Center has been setting up these
types
of events here in Los Angeles and could probably provide more extensive
info on Arab Poets.  Levantine Center is new, basically it's purpose is
to
promote Arab Culture to open up a window on the region that's not
necessarily political.  He would probably be able to hook you up with
Nathalie or her publicist.  She travels quite a bit and may even live =
in
New York...

I am also having a guest sometime in June - Majid Naficy, a Palestinian
Poet.  At the end of this e-mail is a very good article that the LA

Poet of the Revolution
Majid Naficy's tragic journey home

by Louise Steinman


Why do I speak in poetry?
Because in this heavy mist,
I cannot be a lighthouse
For drifting boats.

THE BACK DOOR TO MAJID NAFICY'S MODEST SANTA Monica apartment is open.
The
aroma of sweet and sour wafts in from a Chinese hole-in-the-wall across
the
parking lot. A clay pot full of fresh mint sits on the railing of the
small
patio. On his bookcase shelves, well-worn volumes in Farsi and a few in
English, including Walt Whitman and a Hebrew-English dictionary. On an
old
desk there's an enlargement device that allows the nearly blind poet to
magnify text 60 times so that he can read. Az=E2d, Majid's 12-year-old
son,
is at school -- but he has left behind ample evidence of an American
boyhood: skateboard, baseball mitt, Pok=E9mon cards, sneakers, a =
Michael
Jordan poster taped to the refrigerator.

Majid is a political refugee from Iran, where he was an active
participant
in the revolution against the shah. He lost his first wife, Ezzat, his
brother Sa'id, his brother-in-law Hossein, numerous friends and,
ultimately, his country to the death squads of Ayatollah Khomeini's
fundamentalist Islamic regime.

On the table, there's a framed, faded black-and-white photograph: a
young
unveiled woman with a heart-shaped face and a shy, serious expression.
"This is Ezzat," Majid says tenderly, as if introducing someone
physically
present. He has described this photo in a poem, "To a Picture":


I see you in the middle of the garden
The red roses have covered your skirt.
You seem to be standing on tiptoe
To get a better view of the other side.
Alas, you fell down in the execution field
And my body did not cover you
How short was the landscape of the other side!
But our love still stands upright.

The edge of the picture is torn. "Ezzat's mother used to be in the
photo,"
he says, "but I promised her that I would cut her out." There are no
photos
of Majid and his first wife together. They both lived underground in =
the
dangerous years following the 1979 revolution. "We did not want the
secret
police to recognize us," he says.

I first encountered Majid at a "Writing in Exile" conference sponsored
by
Villa Aurora in 1995. The Villa, an artists' residence and cultural
center
in Pacific Palisades, is now maintained by the German Foreign Office =
and
the Goethe-Institut. The former residence of novelist Leon Feuchwanger,
a
Jewish-German refugee, it's now dedicated to preserving the memory of
writers who fled the Nazis, and to other exiled peoples. At the
conference,
Majid read from one of his essays. I was impressed with the sense of
authority he projected, his quiet intensity, his keen insights into the
painful experience of leaving behind one's native tongue, one's family,
one's history: "My body lives in L.A., but my soul is still rummaging
through the ruins of a lost revolution back in Iran."

In 1999, Beyond Baroque Literary Center published Muddy Shoes, Majid's
first collection of poems translated into English. Soon after, Majid
read
from his work at the downtown Central Library (where I program the
reading
series). Az=E2d sat in the front row of the auditorium, swinging his =
legs,
busy with his Gameboy. Majid walked to the stage of the Mark Taper
Auditorium. A small tape recorder hung from a strap around his neck. He
put
on earphones and pressed the "start" button. Until then, few in the
audience realized that Majid, who doesn't use a cane, is legally blind.
He
never glanced down at a page, but instead prompted himself with his own
voice, his calm, uninflected phrases following the rise and fall of his
breath on tape. The audience was mesmerized.

His poems were indeed rummaging through the ruins of the lost
revolution,
places with names like the Cemetery of Infidels, Evin Prison, the Tower
of
Silence. History and the sad weight of personal and cultural loss were
compressed into haunting lyrics: "I don't want you, petroleum!/Oh,
bloody
stream! For a long time,/I thought you gave me blood./Now I see, you
made
me bleed."

In Iran, this gentle, soft-spoken, middle-aged poet had been an ardent
revolutionary. When asked for an interview, he was slightly =
incredulous:
"Haven't you read my poems? My life is already an open book."
Nevertheless,
over the course of several weeks, he patiently attempted to describe to
me
his experience of the 1979 revolution he so fervently worked for, the
revolution that so spectacularly failed, the revolution that ended up
turning so many lives upside down and inside out.

MAJID WAS BORN IN ISFAHAN, AS HE PUTS IT, "ONE year before the CIA coup
in
1953," the ominous event that toppled Prime Minister Mohammed =
Mossadegh,
who had nationalized Iran's oil industry. Initiated by Britain and
approved
by President Eisenhower because of fears about oil and communism, the
CIA-orchestrated coup brought Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi to power.
Thanks
to a recently leaked CIA report (excerpts of which were published in =
The
New York Times), Americans can now read for themselves how, by deposing
a
still-popular nationalist leader and installing the despotic shah, the
U.S.
government short-circuited an evolving democratic process and =
indirectly
set the stage for the 1979 Islamic takeover of Iran. "There are no
shortcuts in history," Majid said soberly during one of our sessions at
his
kitchen table. "I believe in that. If you think you can take a =
shortcut,
you have to pay a price for it. And that's what we're suffering from
now.
When there is no civil society, the group of people that comes to power
--
however good-intentioned they are -- ends up becoming dictators
themselves."

Isfahan, a city nearly as old as Iran itself, is world-renowned for its
architectural beauty. I found a book on Isfahan and leafed through the
glorious images: the central bridge with 33 arches over the Zayandeh
River;
blue-tiled mosques with vaulted archways and towering minarets; the
Palace
of the 40 Columns, with its long reflecting pool lined with rosebushes;
the
vast central plaza, twice as large as Moscow's Red Square; the Palace =
of
Ali Qapu ("sublime gate"), Iran's first skyscraper; the 17th-century
Imam
Mosque, with acoustics so perfect, according to L.A. Times Middle East
correspondent Robin Wright, that "stomping on the black paving stones
beneath the dome generates a ripple of seven equal echoes."

The Isfahan of Majid's childhood was a tolerant city, Jewish, Armenian
and
Ba'hai communities mingling with the majority Muslims. It was also a
city
that was mixing, for the first time, modern with ancient -- fumes from
the
Soviet-built metallurgy plant collided with the fragrance of cherry
trees
in spring. The Naficy family was large (nine children, five boys and
four
girls) and relatively affluent. Majid's father, a cardiologist trained
in
Tehran and the United States, is a seventh-generation physician in a
family
lineage extending back to the 14th century. His mother was a religious
woman who preferred to wear the veil =E2 in public even though, under =
the
shah, it had been banned. His parents were both peaceful people. "My
father
gave me a sense of being curious," says Majid, "in terms of books and
different cultures. He took us to all different parts of Iran. My =
mother
was very kind. She gave us a sense of how to know other people, and she
was
always optimistic."

Majid's talent for poetry was recognized at an early age; his first =
poem
was published in a literary journal in Isfahan when he was only 13,
thanks
to a poet who was the teacher of his older brother. This teacher, who
edited the journal, invited the young prot=E9g=E9 to the literary =
salons
that
rotated among the houses of Isfahan's various writers. This was a
considerable honor in a country with a rich literary and cultural past,
where people revere great poets and plant luxuriant gardens around =
their
tombs. Fortunately for Majid, his extreme nearsightedness was also
discovered at an early age: "I was 5 years old, sitting in a room with
my
uncle, who asked me to turn on the light. I looked up and I couldn't =
see
the switch. So the first summer before I went to first grade, I wore
eyeglasses. It was very unusual for a child to have eyeglasses,
especially
in Isfahan. Perhaps that is what made me feel separate from the crowd."

Life in Isfahan among his large family made possible a childhood that
even
now conjures pleasant memories. There was a grape arbor in the back
yard;
he was close with his siblings, especially his sisters, and confided in
them. From the shelves of the huge library -- some 3,000 volumes -- =
that
his family had collected over the years, the young poet selected his
first
long novel, Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

Yet even a young child sheltered by a loving family could see the
evidence
of a cruel regime. A memory from age 6: "My school class was taken in
the
early morning to watch the shah pass by in a parade. We had to stand in
the
street a long time. It was very cold. When the shah passed in his
special
car, a man tried to reach his window -- to give him an envelope, =
perhaps
a
complaint. Two guards rushed forward and beat the man with their
ceremonial
swords. This made a deep impression on me."

As he grew older, the oppressive presence of SAVAK, the shah's secret
police, filtered into all aspects of daily life. Citizens could be
imprisoned for any imagined slight against the government. In the =
shah's
dungeons, torture was routine. At the same time as he was forcefully
modernizing the country, fattening the military, importing specialists
from
abroad to build his "Great Civilization," the shah was silencing the
most
enlightened Iranians. Intellectual discourse was stifled. Over the
years,
there was increasingly heavy censorship of films, newspapers, books and
fiction. In 1969, the shah dissolved the Iranian Writers' Organization.

The year after he graduated from high school in Isfahan, Majid came to
California to study. UCLA, like other American campuses, was at the =
time
roiled by protests against the war in Vietnam. It was Majid's first
exposure to democratic protest, and he was impressed by the vigor of
young
Americans' opposition to the war. At UCLA, he also met other Iranians,
members of the Iranian student confederation that opposed the shah's
government. Their Marxism rubbed off on him. "I'd been an
existentialist,"
he tells me. "A conscious existentialist who was very influenced by
Sartre.
I read existential books which criticized Marxism, but when I came =
here,
because of the situation of exile, and because a new radical movement
was
taking shape in Iran, I became very involved with what we called the
urban-guerrilla movement."

At the end of that year, Majid transferred to Tehran University and
committed himself to the movement to overthrow the shah. The newly
minted
Marxist revolutionary was not just opinionated, he was -- as he now
describes -- "self-righteous, intolerant of others' beliefs." He vowed
not
to write poetry again "until the liberation of the proletariat." "I
criticized my poetry as a petit-bourgeois part of my life," he says. "I
was
not alone. Many intellectuals in Iran went that way. When the guerrilla
movement started in the 1970s, it polarized the intelligentsia. Some of
them were subsidized by the government, and some of them joined the
armed
opposition movement." Majid's own brother Sa'id was arrested by SAVAK =
in
1973. His family was tipped off that their house would be raided; =
aunts,
uncles and cousins split up the library, distributing the 3,000 volumes
in
basements and closets all over Isfahan.

IN 1977, MAJID MET EZZAT TABAIAN, FIVE YEARS HIS junior, a student of
physiotherapy at Tehran University. "The first thing we did together =
was
to
organize a protest on campus," he says. "To control the students, SAVAK
had
set a curfew on the women's dormitory. There were guards everywhere on
campus. The women could not get in or go out of their residence after 8
p.m." Majid and Ezzat made large posters calling for a protest, and
posted
them around campus. The ensuing demonstration was a success: The curfew
was
rescinded.

Ezzat and Majid became inseparable and soon married. In 1978, just a
year
before the revolution, the couple traveled around Iran to villages and
factories to organize workers and write about the socioeconomic
situation.
Majid translated and edited a book about women's liberation as well as =
a
Marxist critique of existentialism, both banned by the censors. Around
that
time, their political group, Peykar, broke with strict Marxist =
ideology.
"We decided that armed struggle was not right. The masses have to make
revolution."

By January 1979, the shah had fled the country. There was a brief,
sudden
state of freedom, but the revolution was soon hijacked by the extreme
right, and hope of real democracy fast faded. "I condemn the corrupt
intellectuals and the poisoned pens of conspiring writers and
democrats,"
Ayatollah Khomeini declared soon after his victory. During the terror
that
ensued, thousands of intellectuals were executed or arrested. Majid and
Ezzat went underground, using false identification and living in a safe
house. Majid, as a key member of Peykar's "theoretical team," continued
to
write, edit and produce a monthly underground publication for the
organization.

One afternoon during the fall of 1981, Majid waited at the Shadabad bus
station in Tehran for a 5 p.m. rendezvous with his wife. Five p.m.
passed,
6 p.m. passed, but Ezzat did not appear, nor would she ever appear
again.
She had already been captured and sent to Evin Prison. In his essay,
"Prison Letters: A Look in the Correspondence of an Iranian Political
Prisoner," Majid wrote, "I remember that on precisely January 7, 1982, =
I
felt that the heart of Ezzat, my late wife who had been detained for
four
months, was no longer beating, and when two days later I heard by
telephone
the news of her execution, I was not surprised. The prison walls were
not
able to separate our hearts."

Disguised as a shopkeeper with a derby and beard, he sneaked into the
Cemetery of Infidels, where the Khomeini regime buried its executed
opponents in a series of fresh, unmarked graves. Families of the
deceased
located the graves by measuring paces. Majid found it eight steps =
before
the gate and 16 steps from the wall. Ezzat had been buried with one
other
woman and 50 men, all of whom had been executed together.

In the wake of his wife's murder, the poetry returned. "It was winter,"
he
says. "There was snow on the big mountains around Tehran. I'd gone up =
to
the mountains with friends to commemorate Ezzat. When we came down, I
went
to the safe house. I sat down, and all of a sudden poetry came back to
me.
'I must create her again,' I thought. 'I must take revenge on her
killers.'
I wrote nine poems in one sitting. I hadn't written poetry in eight
years.
Now I know how those cavemen felt when they drew those bulls on the
walls
of caves. You want to create what was lost. It gives you energy -- for
hunting, for magic. It's when you feel powerless against reality, =
that's
when art comes to you."

Eight months after Ezzat's execution, Majid met a fellow revolutionary
named Esmat. "We met each other at a very bad time in our lives," he
says.
They rented a safe house and lived there together for six months. In
April
1983, they fled Iran. With the help of Kurdish guerrillas, they =
traveled
seven days by horseback over the border from Iran into Turkey, moving
only
by night to minimize detection. Majid carried very little with him: the
nine poems for Ezzat he'd written the day he came down from the
mountain,
some money, an Afghani passport, a photo of his brother Sa'id, and the
torn
photograph of Ezzat as a teenager in her garden in Isfahan -- the one
that
sits on the table of his Santa Monica apartment today.

After a year-and-a-half stay in Turkey and France, Majid successfully
applied for political asylum in the United States. "I considered France
my
second homeland, but my eyesight was failing and I already knew English
very well." Settling in Venice with Esmat, who became his second wife
and
the mother of his son -- now divorced, they remain good friends -- he
re-dedicated himself to his vocation as a poet and commenced a period =
of
intense soul-searching. Where had his ideological thinking led him?
Where
had it led his country? "I said to myself, 'Ezzat is dead. The
revolution
is defeated. Okay. But now, what do you want to do with your life? You
have
to start a new life.'"

He started from scratch, first rethinking and criticizing Marx, then
looking squarely at his own culture. "I started to see what had
happened,
because both the left and the right -- both religionists and atheists =
--
admired getting killed, and killing. We wanted to change the regime, no
matter what came after that. Khomeini used the religious feelings of
people
to his advantage. He mixed death worship, or martyrdom worship, with
political ideals." Majid's re-examination yielded a book-length
collection
of essays, written in Persian, with the self-revealing title In Search
of
Joy: A Critique of Male-Dominated, Death-Oriented Culture in Iran.

There was still plenty of death to reckon with. The Iran-Iraq war was
claiming thousands of Iran's young men. In September 1987, about 800
members of L.A.'s large Iranian community (there are 600,000 Iranians
now
estimated to be living in Los Angeles) gathered outside the Federal
Building to protest a visit to the United Nations by the president of
Iran.
It was at this demonstration that Neusha Farahi, a friend of Majid's =
who
owned a Persian bookstore, also in Westwood, set fire to himself as the
ultimate act of protest. He died 13 days later. "I touched his hand
while
we waited for the paramedics," Majid recalls, wincing. "It was like a
burnt
chicken wing." When he came home that same afternoon, Majid wrote "The
Self-Immolation of Neusha," lamenting the seduction of martyrdom. It
contains the lines:


The crowd cried in fury
Trying to gain strength from death.
I told myself,
"Again a corpse in front.
Again a casket behind."
Alas!
We were guardians of life,
But the guardians of death killed so much.
Killed so much.
Killed so much.
So that life tasted of death in our mouths.

IT'S A HOT SUMMER NIGHT IN LOS ANGELES, AND it's Majid's turn to host
the
monthly gathering of "Saturday Notebooks." This Persian literary group
has
been meeting together for 10 years, and they have published three
chapbooks
of their work. Majid's small apartment has been transformed: Twenty
people
-- men and women -- crowd into his living room. Everyone has brought
something to read and critique, as well as something to eat. There is a
vase of pale-pink roses, bowls of fresh basil and mint leaves, hummus,
peaches, plums. Chicken-and-squash stew simmers on the stove. The
scheduled
start time is 7 p.m., but participants straggle in late from a
demonstration at the Federal Building, commemorating the one-year
anniversary of the government crackdown on pro-reform =E2 student
demonstrations in Tehran.

As the session finally gets under way, Majid asks for a moment of
silence
in memory of his dear friend Houshang Golshiri, one of Iran's greatest
fiction writers and a prominent advocate of human rights, who has
recently
died in Tehran. Everyone stands, heads bowed.

Even to a guest with zero comprehension of Farsi, plenty is =
communicated
over the next several hours. All these writers bring seriousness and
passion to their work. When your colleagues at home are being arrested,
imprisoned, even murdered, for their exercise of free expression, the
right
to exchange words and ideas is not a privilege you take for granted. I
can't help stealing glances at the man sitting beside me, who is =
missing
the ring finger on his right hand. Later, Majid confirms my hunch: This
writer lost his finger during a torture session in one of the shah's
prisons.

Around 10 p.m., the group pauses for supper. I heap onto my plate some
of
Majid's stew. "Delicious!" I comment to one of the writers. He sidles
closer. "Actually," he confides, "Majid is a much better poet than he =
is
a
cook." He takes another mouthful himself. "And he is a most wonderful
father."

AZ=E2D AND HIS BUDDY DAVID ZOOM in the front door of the apartment on
their
shiny scooters. Az=E2d is a robust, handsome kid with meltingly =
beautiful
dark eyes. He is not shy. To the time-honored question of "What do you
want
to be when you grow up?" Az=E2d has a ready, earnest answer: "I don't =
want
to
have poetry for a job when I grow up. I'd like to be a basketball =
player
or
a baseball player." What does he think of his father's poetry? His eyes
light up. He grins at his dad. "My favorite is 'Secret of the River.' =
My
dad wrote it for me. I've read it to my class at school." Before =
heading
out the door with his friend, he does something I've never known a
12-year-old boy to do. He recites a poem from memory:


Every day we go along the river
And your body
Takes on the smell of the water.

Seeing us, the wild geese
Tune up their battle horns,
And a cat behind its green hideout
Lifts his tail in triumph.
The old fishermen,
With their buckets full of sorrow
Move from place to place
And a palm frond in our way
Forces me to bend my head.

I stand still.
And as you sleep on my shoulder
I think to myself:
"It's too late for me
But maybe you will find
The secret of the river."
CAN MAJID IMAGINE EVER GOING back to Iran? "Only if the government
apologized for what they did," he says emphatically. Isn't that
unlikely?
Is there even a precedent? "It's not unprecedented," Majid insists.
"Madeleine Albright recently apologized for what the U.S. did to Iran =
in
1953, for the CIA coup. It's just like a personal relationship -- if =
you
want to have a relationship, apology is the first step."

However, he's not holding his breath, for an apology, or for his =
return.
In
the years since receiving asylum, Majid has become an American poet.
Editor
Ardavan Daravan, who included Majid's work in an influential anthology
of
Iranian-diaspora literature, spent years trying to find significant
voices
for his collection. Majid was among those writers, Daravan says, "who
had
made the transition . . . who could connect their experiences living
abroad
with their original cultural traditions." Fred Dewey of Beyond Baroque
wrote in his foreword to Muddy Shoes that Majid's poetry "is born of
great
suffering yet affirms deep dignity and respect for that wider =
experience
of
the world, brought here through danger and carved out of solitude and
reflection. Tragically, we are seldom allowed to hear or see such
things,
blocked from sensing the reality of other countries, knowledges, forms
of
speech; when these are allowed in, or come in, they are, without
recourse,
smoothed out, conquered, if you will, without mercy. Majid, as a poet =
of
Los Angeles, suggests a new route."

Majid's adopted city has recently adopted one of his poems. At the
intersection of Brooks Avenue and Ocean Front Walk in Venice, where
Majid
frequently jogs with Az=E2d on a scooter beside him, the L.A. =
Recreation
and
Parks Department has engraved on a concrete wall a stanza from his long
poem "Ah, Los Angeles." The poem is Majid Naficy's manifesto, one that
proclaims he is no longer in exile.

=20


Ah, Los Angeles!

I accept you as my city,

And after 10 years

am at peace with you.

Waiting without fear

I lean back against the bus post.

And I become lost

In the sounds of your late night.

A man gets off the Blue Bus 1

And crosses to this side

To take RTD 4.

Perhaps he too is coming back

From his nights on campus.

On the way he has sobbed

Into a blank letter.

And he has heard the voice of a woman

With a tropical accent.

On the RTD 4 it rains.

A woman is talking to her umbrella

And a man ceaselessly flushes a toilet.

I told Carlos yesterday,

"Your clanging cart

Wakes me up in the morning."

He collects cans

And wants to go back to Cuba.

From the Promenade

Comes the sound of my homeless man.

He sings sadly

As he plays his guitar.

Where in the world can I hear

The black moaning of the trumpet

Alongside the Chinese chimes?

And see this warm olive skin

Through blue eyes?

The heedless pigeons

Have perched on the empty benches.

They stare at the dinosaur

Who sprays old water on our kids.

Marziyeh sings from afar.

I return, homesick

And I put my feet

On your back.

Ah, Los Angeles!

I feel your blood.

You taught me to get up

And look with love

At my beautiful legs

And along with the marathon

Run on your broad shoulders.

Once I wanted to commit suicide.

I coiled up under my blanket

And was a recluse for two nights.

Then, I turned on the radio,

And I heard the poems of a Russian poet,

Who in a death camp,

Was denied paper

But his wife learned them by heart.

Will Az=E2d read my poems?

On the days that I take him to school,

He sees the bus number from far off.

And makes things easier for me.

At night he stays under the shower

And lets the drops of water

Spray on his young skin.

Sometimes we go to the beach.

He bikes and I skate.

He buys a Pepsi from a machine

And gives me one sip.

Yesterday we went to Romteen's house.

His father is a Parsee from India.

He wore sadra and kusti

While he was painting the house.

On that little stool

He looked like a Zoroastrian

Rowing from Hormuz to Sanjan.

Ah, Los Angeles!

Let me bend down and put my ear

To your warm skin.

Perhaps in you

I will find my own Sanjan.

No, it's not a ship scraping

Against the rocky shore;

It's the rumbling of Blue Bus 8.

I know.

I will get off at Idaho Street

And will pass the shopping carts

Left by the homeless.

I will climb the wooden staircase

And will open the door.

I will start the answering machine

And in the dark

I will wait like a fisherman.

As someone who has gone through (and sometimes circumvented) this processin
both the arts and the sciences whether or not it is formally designated as
suchI feel I should comment but I'm at a loss for words.

In the science arena there is peer review and there is peer review, and the
NEJM< JAMA, and Lancet even went through some problems recently because of
financial pressures they were feeling but as a consumer (and analogically,
reader) I've learned from experience to wait until I see it in their pages
rather than hear it advertised on TV.

I don't think the arts need to follow this model to be given equal status
academically, but I'm not sure what that might be.  It might be worth
looking at the publication process of APA as a useful blend of the arts and
sciences, here?

I would go a step further.  I think that the solution you propose
adds on to the peer-review system without necessarily considering if
peer-review is the best means to accomplish its own ends (not that I
wouldn't welcome a site like you propose!).

What I am envisioning is a site, let's call it academedia.org (if it
isn't taken yet).  The site would be a sort of clearing-house for
academic papers based on a slashdot/epinions self-organizing model.
Authors could set up an account, and submit work in different
categories.  They would also read works and rate them, and if they
really liked an author, they would add them to their "colleague"
list.  The first time they visited a category, they would see a mess
of works.  Once they started rating and trusting other authors, their
reading experience would change.  If they visited the "language
poetry" section, they would see works by people they consider
"colleagues," or that their colleagues respect.  Highly rated essays
would float to the top of each section, but that "ranking" is
specific to each reader.  Everyone would get his or her own niche
journals filled with work they respect.  A system like this can be
done with present technology, and plays into the strengths of digital
media.  Instead of gatekeeping as the primary form of content
management, you rely on filtering.

Or you can do away with the clearinghouse and simply allow networks
of writers to develop based upon the currency of links: like in
blogging.

Neither of these systems necessarily encourages rash, not thought-out
writing like email based listservs with their ready send button.  At
their roots, they are content delivery mechanisms that adapt to
whatever style of writing a writer prefers, and they allow a writer
as much composition time prior to posting and the ability to revise
their works after posting.

Just some thoughts,
--

No criticism should be ignored. It's all something to work against. As
the best art always does. And if it doesn't, if it isn't transgressive, it's
on a slippery slope toward propaganda.

Maybe that was too harsh. And "transgressive" itself is questionable .
. .

But anyway, there are normalizing forces at work from all sides, not
just from the academy. And they all must be worked with.
Anthologies are a force. The Poetics List is a force. AWP & MLA are
forces. American Poetry Review is a force. Right?

I worked for seven years delivering newspapers to work my way
through college and grad school. Believe me, the other people (in the
central Texas area) working at the newspaper distribution center were
a force putting pressure on my writing. When they found out I wrote
POETRY . . . made my dissertation defence look like a game of spin
the bottle.

I swear I had a better point to make when I first started writing this.
Oh well.

this kind of systemalready exists formally and informally in the sciences.
Ingenta would be an example and informally there are several who post

Why am I being asked this?  Is my commitment in question?  Is the efficacy
of my labor in doubt?  Have I not served the cause diligently?  I swear on
the futures of the people, my loyalty is with the Party, and all the fruits
of my endeavors are dedicated to the achievement of materialist Utopia!
Believe me!

Please do not send me to the "resorts."  I give you my solemn word that I
believe in a poetics that makes both the means of production and the
commodities produced thereby available to the workers themselves (with the
understanding that both will be used in good faith to further the ends of
the Party).

As a teacher, my duty, and the duty of every responsible pedagogue, is to
present students with the concepts and statistics necessary for the
construction of a collective consciousness in which aesthetic
self-indulgence is subdued by the emergence of a virile class upheaval.
Revolution begins in the notebooks of the ephebes.  Texts are
interchangeable, and canonization is fetishization.  Scholars should know
how to use a shovel and pickaxe as well as a computer and thesaurus.  To
hold forth the illusion of intellectual democracy is to betray the
determined cycle of economic materiality that motivates all "culture."
Poetry must acknowledge its status as applied metasymbolic communication,
and a mature poetics must reveal anticommunicative models of poesis for the
formalist mystifications they are.

I said it correctly, no?  Yes?

Please let me keep my dog!  He is for protection only; I have not invested
him with any foolish anthropomorphic "personality"!

I'm sorry, I was just goofing on Joel's question instead of taking it
seriously.  It was a reasonable question, and deserves a reasonable answer.

So, in hopes of making amends, here's my sincere statement of political
orientation, etc.

I have no coherent political orientation.  This is not to claim
apoliticality; rather, I find myself constantly rehearsing a bevy of
diverse, sometimes contradictory political opinions, responses, and biases,
and these positions never manage to assemble into a unified position.  I
guess another way of saying this is that I'm a typical bourgeois liberal
humanist.  Nevertheless, I find myself more often agreeing with leftist
analyses of world political situations than with "moderate" or right-wing;
not usually liking either left or right solutions, but having none better to
offer; not liking democrats any better than republicans, but usually hoping
they win anyway; distrusting all utopian philosophies; sympathizing with
environmentalist arguments even when I suspect that they are slanted or
specious.  These are all absurdly local reactions as opposed to articulated
beliefs, but I'm just trying to be accurate here, and for me, accuracy
involves a kind of particular, enumerative process of observation (here,
self-observation).  I'll leave it to someone else to perform the synthesis
whereby they arrive at the conclusion: "wishy-washy."

How does this play into my teaching and writing?  In the classroom, I try
whenever possible to point out how rhetoric and aesthetics are tied in to
the production of ideological and political meanings in a given culture,
including our own, but not in any systematic way or with any rigorously
theorized agenda (other than on the broadest level of, say, "anti-Bush"
sentiment, etc.).  In my poetry, it's basically just a working through of
the inchoate complexes I describe above.  More often than not, this emerges
in the work as a broad sense of paralyzing skepticism or disgust.  I guess
my earlier "joke" post reflects that.  Again, I'm offering this as a
political self-description, NOT a prescription.  I'm not saying eclecticism
is either good or bad, I'm just being honest.  Would my poetry be "better"
if I had a consistent politics that I plugged into it?  I don't know.
Maybe.  All I can say is that I tend not to evaluate other poets on the
basis of their political orientation or level of commitment to that
orientation, except when it's manifestly reprehensible.  And I actually
can't remember the last time I saw a poem recommending the death penalty or
anything like that anyway.

Hope this helps.  Sorry again for being a smartass the first time.

Kasey

Hello,

Originally I backchanneled this, but I'll go ahead and post it.

I agree with Jeff's implication that that we are "denying something here,"
but it's not just a problem of disconnection between the academic writing
and poetry, or even the academy and art; I think it's between the
educational system and society. Especially humanities programs seem content
to allow themselves to drift away from those who not only pay the bills but
hope to become better educated through it. A literary "education" seems
reserved for a class of skeptics who can talk in a certain code-language.
Those willing to participate in a complicated power game. Hence the
development of the ubiquitous "business school." (Who would want to be
around us?  Businesspeople may not understand Ashbery, but they are
contemplative enough to know when they aren't learning anything useful.)
No, humanities departments aren't training people to integrate academic
knowledge with life, to see the relevance of literature to society, or
giving them the resources to become better people (one of the earliest
missions of an English education was moral improvement).

One site of this "crisis" for English depts is composition, since every
student has to take it. Here are the first two paragraphs from an article I
ran across years ago in Public Interest called "Why Johnny Can't Write"--
admittedly it's a bit heated--

"American employers regard the nation's educational system as an
irrelevance, according to a Census Bureau survey released in February of
this year. Businesses ignore a prospective employee's educational
credentials in favor of his or her work history and attitude. Although the
census researchers did not venture any hypotheses for this strange behavior,
anyone familiar with the current state of academia could have provided
explanations aplenty.

"One overlooked corner of the academic madhouse bears in particular on
graduates' job-readiness--the teaching of writing. In the field of writing,
today's education is not just an irrelevance, it is positively detrimental
to a student's development. For years, composition teachers have absorbed
the worst strains in both popular and academic culture. The result is an
indigestible stew of 1960s liberationist zeal, 1970s deconstructivist
nihilism, and 1980s multicultural proselytizing. The only thing that
composition teachers are not talking and writing about these days is how to
teach students to compose clear, logical prose."


I would like to affirm Philip Nikolayev's statement that the "poetry scene"
is as full of infighting and political bullshit as the academic world.  Both
"scenes" also have their deserving stars, those who plow through the BS and
focus on what's at hand.

I enjoy writing criticism, but I don't write much prose my mom can't
understand on first reading (the poetry--eh hem--is another matter).  Down
with blocky obscurantist academese, and those assistant professors who write
it!  Down with specialism!

My goal is to give a successful poetry reading at a truckstop in outstate
Missouri.


Best to all,

Erma Bombeck

Subject:      Why poets should read only cereal boxtops
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I find this to be a bad attitude: anti-intellectual,
divisive . . .

It works from a notion that poetry's input/output with
its other related disciplines is a conveyor belt that
goes something like

     AUTONOMOUS POET >
     EDITOR >
     PUBLISHER >

a.   READER
b.1  CRITIC
b.2  REVIEWER

where the poet writes, the editor selects, the
publisher puts into print/on-line, the unauthorized
reader operates in a position of silence as
unresponsive consumer, and the critic ---perish
forbid--- responds.  There is also a
secondary/tertiary type of reader/critic position
thought of as the "book review," which, unlike
criticism, is welcome, as its seen as a form of book
promotion or advertising.

Anything that violates that flow chart, that chain of
effects where the poetry is handed along with potatos
in a potato sack race, such as critics overstepping
their putatively derivative position and actually
daring to become the inspiration or source of poetry,
is regarded as a disturbance in poetry's ripple
effects and should be avoided, condemned.

Even when not outright ignored and boycotted, it is in
an antagonistic relation to the poet (J. Gallagher:
It's all something to work against. "").

First of all, I think this is wrong in that the
different types of literature workers are not
different ~species~ that lack the genes to mate.  They
are ~roles.~

Of the examples of the "stereotypical" academic critic
position that Chris Stroffolino lists, ---Sianne Ngai,
Lytle Shaw, Steve Evans, Juliana Spahr--- Lytle and
Juliana are both poets as well, there is published and
a novel poetry by Ngai (I have simply ever seen any
poetry by Steve Evans and don't know if he writes
poems), ~and,~ Juliana, multivalent, is poet, critic,
~and~ editor (Chain).  At different times, one may
fulfill one or the other function within the literary
economy; they are not mutually exclusive.

(In fact, the ~academic~ (as graduate student) is a
very short-lived position, in general: viz., the
Poetics archives where .edus come and go and
~disappear.~  There are years where the names of the
main participants, just as eagerly involved then as
today's subscribers in the current debate, have
totally vanished from public record, in many cases
presumably phased out of academics and maybe even
poetry.)

This conveyor belt model is based upon the fallacy of
poety as, yes, definitely a stripe of language
("materialist") but poetry as an isolated discourse or
form of text that does not engage in dialogue or draw
upon and feed into the general element of language as
fluidly as, for example, list posts do.

A better-educated poet is a better poet (a
better-educated ~person~ is in a better position to
write).  One of the artificial boundaries that Andrew
Rathmann's anti-criticism rant sets up is a wall
between poetry and thinking.  To the contrary, as
ideas are, in the final wash, very much a part of
poetry (and inescapably a part of language, in its
ideological dimension), why shouldn't poetry be in an
open give-and-take with any and every area of
thinking?  Academic criticism is simply the commentary
(critique, analysis) of literateurs whose somewhat
more comfortable, non-"working class" positions afford
them a greater leisure and impetus to direct
themselves at thinking.  They're ~experienced,~
hopefully, at honing their reading into a sort of
hypostasis with thinking.

Without the critic and feedback, ---how else does
poetry advance itself?  It's ~then~ that the raw power
mechanisms of coterie, personal influence, private
capital (publishing), etc., take on monopolistic
dominance, and poets are promoted without studied
justification beyond their proximity to major
metropolitan centers, what good socialites they are,
and so on.

This false division between poetry and criticism,
between poetry and other modes of language, instead of
a relaxed switching back and forth between modes, as a
sort of "broken English," may in fact be much of why
the Poetics List has, in general, abandoned poetics.
If Steve Evans' writing is discussed at the cocktail
party, it's to agree how terribly rude of him it was
be such a brute over Rebecca Wolff,--- since poets
choose not to engage with his Hegelian ideas or the
possibility that any friendly fire was just the
regretable casualty of his otherwise coherent
thinking.  That function is split off.  If a
subscriber's sign-on doesn't have a conspicuous .edu
suffix at the tail end (really just a form of wearing
a fraternity pin, as subscriber accounts can just as
easily be set up to more anonymous or democratic
alternative e-mail servers), there's no way of
speaking ~ex cathedra.~  Poets become completely
submerged in poetry as solely ~practice,~ without
being interested in ---our capacity to do so
increasingly atrophies--- articulating anything about
the poem in non-poem language: that would only expose
how unreflexive and blind-to-itself the process has
become for most.

Oddly, too, the Language Poets that the List
ostensibly dates back to were expressly engaged in
producing their own, intellectualist poets' criticism,
a genre that has largely disappeared.

Poets now presume that their poems ~should~ go out
deafly into the world, like the penny dropped into the
wishing well without making any sound.  If it ~does~
encounter dialogue, questions, analysis, criticism,
the reaction ---because the poet has maintained
herself/himself in such an interaction-starved
vacuum--- is that there's something ~wrong~ with that,
and it would be better to leave the work
self-contained, hermetically sealed.  We ~resent~
people responding.

Personally, I think of the ultimate model of this New
Man critic has having been the late Ramez Qureshi,
someone who is at home and as hungry for the life of
the mind as he was for the call of poetry.  With no
academic credentials beyond an on-line ~correspondence
course~ B.A. that he was eternally completing, his
criticism was quite serious, definitely respectable
and sometimes exemplary in the insights it
achieved,--- and he, at least, without any
credentializing pay-off to be gained from it, was an
absolute ~fanatic~ (fan) of Adorno's.  (There should
be a Ramez Qureshi Prize for Criticism established.)

The first of a series of profiles and interviews with web/net artists has been launched at
http://turbulence.org/Works/media2 . Featured are Michiel Knaven (Holland), Reiner Strasser
(Germany), and Stanza (England). All three are using English as the language of their sites,
have produced impressive bodies of multimedia, interactive work available on the Web, and
synthesize arts and media with an engaging command of tools ranging from DHTML to Flash and
Shockwave. I hope you enjoy their work as I have.

1. Jeffrey Hamilton, I think Jeffrey Jullich's recent post is proof of how
complex the issues are that Andrew Rathmann rants at, and the reason why I
asked for some clarity to be mixed in with his rant if at all possible, so
that we could get some differentiation.

2. Joel, are you thinking of asking Leonard why he thinks Kasey's first post
is the greatest, given what Leonard has posted in the past? Please don't.

3a. Kasey, you don't need to apologize for status quo sentiments. No one
else does on this list.

b. I don't have my sources with me, but Marx, for one, has been taught in a
number of top-notch business schools since the late ninetiess, if not
earlier than that.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

(the work so far iv)


    phenomenology of approach


    = approaching the everglades, the city, illness, language, culture =

     0  intermittent text
the text of dispersal. sections are written into and out of the outline.
the text is governed by the outline. subsequent versions increase the
quantitative content, refine the tolerance of the investigation. the text
is an accumulation or collocation of interspersions.
     1  domain limited or unlimited
a limited domain is inscribed with or without fuzzy boundaries. domains
may be limited in sememe, space, and/or time. example: everglades bounded
by hydrology, ecosystem. for example (below): everglades younger than
writing, than human inscription. for example (below): the scribble:
scribbled note, indecipherable handwriting, noise in the machine. the
state/meant of the domain is always already a delimitation. (limits are
closed sets in relation to the rest of the world/s, worlding.)
     2  clues and cues from immemorial past
a clue is an interpretable symptom, according to a scheme based on an
articulated methodology. a cue is the activation of a scheme based on an
anomaly or repetitive structure within the domain. the domain in turn may
be defined by clues and cues.
     3  difference between clues and cues
a clue is based on evidence from the past to the present; a cue is based
on activation within the present.
     4  relevance theory and approach
clues and cues are such by virtue of relevance; theoretical methodology is
part of a critical sifting apparatus.
     5  top-down classification schema
this follows for example category theory, chaos/fractal theories; one
always already begins with pre-theoretic presuppositions.
     6  wonder, innovation, contradictions
beginning with a sense of awe - everything signs everything, everything
inscribes. innovation in terms of heuristic projections and introjections
- contradictions in terms of anomalies, revisions, recuperations, returns.
     7  deep ecologies, interstitial
the ecologies become perceptually deeper; gaps are filled in; one lives in
depth in the glades, aware of cyclical time, anomalous events, local
histories, individual plants and animals.
     8  filling in the habitus
from larger to smaller clues and cues - alligators and wading birds to
landbirds and invertebrates for example. as one moves down in scale,
identification becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible.
     9  from anomaly to behaviors
and back again; behavior clusters based on attributes. or from story to
structure, diachrony to synchrony, anecdote to prediction.
    10  sense of occupation and intimacy
inhabitation based on familiarity, familiality.
    11  familiarity, familiality
in the first, equivalence scripts and schemata, universals, typifications;
in the second, identity scripts and experientials, individuations.
    12  maternality
chora and matrix - the inchoate beneath the surface of the subject.
    13  deconstruction of the abject
disarticulation of the abject as such and rearticulation in terms of
microstructure, skein. the muck and clutter in relation to marl/peat moss
and biome or flora/fauna regimes. muck and clutter as regimes.
    14  phenomenology of naming
following the notion of rigid designators, beginning with classification,
classification experience, virtual subjectivity and its relation to
concrete manifestation.
    15  inarticulate inchoate
maternality: see above. the proffering of languaging or template.
    16  the mess and its overcoming
entanglement as regime intrusions, conflicting biomes, collapse or
implosion, niche-construction, problems of scale in space and time.
    17  phenomenology of touch
demarcation of environment on the body - thicket tangle, poisonwood,
against the skin. differentiation of the mass.
    18  reinscription of domain
the domain _as_ continually inscribed in negotiation. linguistic contract
of the subject. increasingly fuzzy boundary issues. refinement of
differentiations - typology to decreasing tolerances.
    19  immersive and definable structures
definable is fully reversible; immersive is fuzzy, vectored. both are
capable of meta-level collocations, i.e. a definable of definable,
immersive of definable, etc.
    20  clue skeins
clues related theoretically, taxonomically, in terms of typifications,
taxonomies - heuristic skeins, established on the run.
    21  the instrumental reason of flows and part-objects
fluid mechanics, turbulence, stases within the flow - non-equilibrium
thermodynamics. the partitioning, parcelling, clutter, of the world.
part-objects as modules: modules 'on the part of' the subject, and modules
'defined as such' within the continually reinscribed domain.
    22  gestural logics and superimpositions
such that partial information (as in land's experiments re: color vision)
extends across a total domain or spectrum.
    23  delaying conclusions and the settling-in of elements
inconclusivity of discourses which are increasingly refined. elements
noticed and defined 'settle in' - in the sense of familiarity - always
with default tags - i.e. elimination by counterexample. retention of _weak
theory_ - searching for coherency without retention of apparently outmoded
paradigms.
    24  continuous processing and absorption of anomalies
anomalies as generative of domain boundaries, entities, temporary
inscriptions, potential of part-objects, etc. the anomaly as the mis-fit
among the accountable and accounted-for. as unaccountable, uncounted, the
anomaly generates circumscriptions, circumlocutions; these are involved by
the subject in a consideration and absorption of the _detour._ every
anomaly potentially turns everything around, and is turned around by
everything.
    25  modes of approach in space and time
diachronic/synchronic approaches - space-time slices. diffusion of
occluded layerings (bay bottoms versus onshore mangrove island
topography). architectonics of the domain.
    26  horizons of 'natural' and 'unnatural' worlds
and horizons of 'subjective' and 'objective' worlds - in relation to
heuristics and experiential structures (immersivities). definition is both
tool and violation; mobile fuzzy domain boundaries participate in the
natural (i.e. given) order as well as ideological political/economic
conscious and unconscious considerations.
    27  weakening of perceptual structures and responses
approach is always already self-critical, self-critique; the critique
itself is withdrawn from the self, sublimated into emergent considerations
of the domain. the phenomenology of approach implies a weakness of
language, definition, inscription, boundary, instrumental reason; it
implies releasement, waiting (not waiting-upon) as well.
    28  releasement and listening
to listen without consideration of the source, the speech, one's answer;
to avoid pausological structures ('yes, but...'); to speak after (what
appears to be) the case.
    29  buildings, dwellings, and habitations
domains as fuzzy architectures, the build world, to the extent of the
delimitation. dwelling, as in residing within the domain, within the
subjective horizon of the experiential mode in relation to the domain. the
domain as inhabited by the subject, wor(l)ds becoming 'natural' in the
sense of familiarity, familiality.
    30  the neighborhood
it is the neighborhood, communality, the constitutes the increasing
approach of the domain. to the extent of a phenomenology of approach, the
domain is asymptotic, never fully approached. the neighborhood is a
confluence of neighborhoods, intersections demographics, zones and zoning
ordinances, ethnicities - just about any conceivable attribute, fuzzy or
not (for example, families whose surnames begin with 'Mc'). the neighbor-
hood is also a maternality, a comfort-zone, an occupation constituted by
the participant's introjections and projections. neighborhood is created
by their increasing coherency and stability, a homeostatic domain itself.
the attainment of homeostasis involves mechanisms for absorbing anomaly,
to the extent that anomaly becomes subsumed (i.e. this moth is an unknown
species within the imperial silk family).
    31  intersecting populations and worlds
no domain is pure, no approach can posit an isolated object for long.
skeins intermesh diachronically and synchronically, across disciplines and
other semi-rigid boundaries of the classical episteme. domains possess
symptomatic leakage and staining; there are stigma-zones, exhaustion
zones, depletion zones, zones of surplus accumulations. what is posited as
an object both diffuses and expands; becoming invisible, it participates
within neighborhooding, worlding - becoming visible, it participates in
skew-orthogonal skeining and the report.
    32  phenomenology of withdrawal
    33  the skein (skew-orthogonal)
the grid and its imposition, input-output matrices, markov chains, tensors
and absorptions of data, local geodesics, fuzzy or clouded enumerations,
collocations of data.
    34  the skein (askew and local)
the local scribble, local geodesics without embedding, fluid-mechanical or
cellular automata modeling, closures, accumulations of data, local messes.
    35  increasing audacity and circumscription
    36  the report
for example: the everglades as we know them are younger than writing; this
residue is older than that. the report is tailored to distribution modes,
economics, audience, historiographies, symbolic conventions, bibliography
and reference, dedication and authority, placement within or without
various series, a particular written language, attendant taxonomic ploys,
languages, and paradigms.
    37  the distribution
    38  the thinking of it
and the rethinking of it, the arc through and across the report, response,
distributions, counter-distributions, argument and counter-argument, the
return to the field, the walking-through the field, and always already
transformation of the domain and its problematic.
    39  the world of it
the world is all that is the case. but the world and worlding are
dissimilar and 'the' already breaks down among virtual and real, virtual
particles and introjections/projections, phantasms and implicate orders.
nothing remains of encompassment; domains dissolve or problematize, just
as the 'of it' - already a possessive - is another releasement.

The risk of drowning is both metaphoric and real - there are signature

One of the rangers described Everglades visitors as down 30% since the 70s
- whereas every other park is growing fast. This is because there, I
think, there are no demarcations - drive around, focus on the larger birds
and alligators, leave. She described the park as "layered" - identifica-
tion in terms of the object increasingly magnifies; if we had stayed, we
would have gone to microscopy. There is also the problematic of identity
within the entanglement, which is also the problematic of post-modern
identities, looped, eviscerated in terms of public/private, and caught in
the matrices of what I called "radiations" or (Cantor) dusts - computer,
telephone, radio/tv transmission, inter and intranettings, hackings, and
so forth - not to mention the problematic of _what_ is caught as such -
after Lacan / Foucault, we can't go back to the monolith of the unitary
subject, monad, etc. -

> And is this projected for a book?

If I'm given the time/space to work on such - the problem is my usual
instabilities in terms of income and the stress this produces. Certainly
my thoughts for years have revolved around the issues of consciousness and
intermediations in relation to formal systems - and what happens when
these systems are chaotic, ungrounded, tangled, confused, fuzzy, etc. -

4. Aaron Belz, I have an honest question for you -- or, actually, for anyone
who might want to speak on this issue, which is general enough. My question
kind of slants off of Joel's recent post.

I don't mean this question to be in the least inflammatory in kind. I ask it
as someone who has only recently begun to read listserv postings again. I'm
trying to orientate myself to the list and to its posters.

I'm curious to know how "you" view your own views, in terms of where you
think they come from and where you think they're going. Do you think of them
as affirming a status quo that is troublingly absent and in need of
continual affirmation? Or, do you think of your views as tending towards the
singular/specific and peripheral? Or, do you think that this model of status
quo vs. singular/peripheral/specific is really, laughably outdated? Or, do
you not really think about how you views your views? If this paradigm of
center/periphery is outdated, is there a paradigm you would use by which to
view your views?

Thanks for the link Tom; Igenta is a good site, but it is really just an
online library for journals at heart, no?

Can we escape the metaphor of the scholarly journal?  I don't know.

That's the rub, isn't it Komninos?  What I'm suggesting is that academic
publishing needs a paradigm shift.  The fact that people need their work
recognized by a peer review journal seems like a case of the snake biting
its tail.  A self organizing system provides CLEARER recognition of
approval by peers.  It is, in many ways, the ultimate peer
review.  Standards for measuring academic success are focused on the
primary methods of publication during the academic boom of the twentieth
century.  That doesn't mean that those standards shouldn't be adjusted as
the methods of publication change too.

As I said before, the challenge is to challenge the notions of how we
measure research.

Realistically, it may take awhile before other systems of measurement are
given the institutional sway that peer review has achieved.  But that
doesn't mean other ways aren't yearning toward the same ideals that
current academic publishing champions...

Elizbeth. (I know I'm not the Ric referred to..) I havent read all this. =
 But another take on nonsense: in a sense (sense?) it impossible towrite =
nonsense or even non - sense ...if we think of Lear etc his non- sense =
is kind of "set up" as such but even if I write "garbage" (random speil) =
a sense will be discerned: now there are writers who use computers to =
write poems...now they are, I feel, largely futile, but the =
incorporation of 'random' things into a work  (assumes, or cant avoid =
that) that the "I" or the "they" in some way filter this info in: but =
that aside there is also always a semantic conection. (Eg even a single =
letter on a page has some semantic "value").So if one were to utilise =
(as it doubtless been done many times) the procedure of organising the =
work and then having assistants (we're back in Michelangelo's quarry and =
 so on) (or Billy Apple or maybe Warhol). What is interesting about  a =
"random" computer generated thing is how often thematic "links" of =
"leitmofis or whatever  might repeat: It would be neccessary to involve =
many writers and writigngs into a text and also some who wrote some =
addendum ahving NOT SEEN the preceding text, others who had , and some =
who were just asked to ask to write a response: just some thoughts. =
Richard


What Ric says below at first seems to be AN example of "nonsense" but I =
can "read" it and it means to me...and I agree in part: but =
nonexistence.. simpler way of talking of that is that nonexistsence is a =
thing: now everything that is conceivable must be, or it is the the =
thing conceiving and being conceived. So nonexistence in the sense of =
death becomes a thing conceived now, say, but we could call =
"nothingness" that every thing without which there is no something:  =
this is not to say that a "hard materialist" is not right as maybe we do =
simply vanish at death: but I think that all literature all art, =
kiekegaard, what i can understand of Heidegger, poetry, life, love, =
consciousness: make the "absolute hard-aetheist" or hard-Marxist =
position a dead one........this is not to diminish science: I'm in  a =
hurry here but my take any way is that while "organised religion" and =
various formal cults may move a person further form "the truth: the big  =
ontological chocolate thing" (to semi quote Silliman I think it was), =
and while eg for Eliot it served, if to noyt "enliven" him it did in his =
poetry, nor can I buy into the hard amterialist thing: to jump I canse =
ric's writin below as an example of poetry-philosophy etc conflating: =
but, yes,dogma as such tajes us away from the "deep power" within us =
that makes us poets poets and puts us - at certain temporal inflames - =
in deep touch with what ever motivates our and the general dust: what =
ever in-spires. Tap root deep poet. Richard.  (So, above, nothingness is =
always linked to being: or non- nothingness).=20

  Hi,
  Non-sense is not  necessarily
  no-sense. Similar to how
  non-existence does not necessarily
  mean no-existence. (huh ?)
  let me attempt to clarify...
  What constitutes our sense or/of
  existence does not always take
  into consideration former incarnations
  of what 'sense' might have been
  conceived to potentialities 'beyond'
  our contemporary grasp.
  Perception is a paradox, whereas it is
  both solipsistic and, 'by laws that be',
  must relate to the collective consciousness
  we all partake in.
  So 'sense' must be a 'matter' of attunement
  to auras and tonalities that we can, at times,
  see, hear, and cogitate according to 'our'
  sensate leanings. We do our constitutions
  an injustice by limiting them to the ephemeral,
  watered -down effigies that we accept as dogma.



  Just thot I'd add my 2 sense (groan) ...

Aaron,

Maybe Jeff will reply to this.  Hope so.  I fear my intemperance rising,
but you have managed to repeat some of the more annoying cliches about
Anguish and the Edu-Kation system, for which I remain an unabashed
partisan.

I don't know where the Ashbery comment comes from.  Many undergraduates,
even English majors, will not come in to contact with his work.  Anyone
who teaches in an English dept. these days knows that we are not in the
business of complexifying things, at least in undergraduate classrooms.
Few people can profess theory in a class without trying to unpack it and
present it in ways that are understandable.  We can't take Blake's line,
however so much we want to.  Your average american undergrad is a
demanding sort in this regard.  It is the case that literature as
discipline schools people in the arts of ambiguity.  But this schooling,
along with philosophy and history, is what law schools prefer, as well as
not a few marketing departments.  In any case, its offensive to suggest
that literature departments are wholly of out touch with everyday life,
because they tend to be some of the most responsive parts of the
university.  Too much so, according to another right wing perspective.

This take on the biz perspective on the university is also misguided
because the private sector _does_ want people with bachelor's degrees, to
the extent that universities are being pushed to offer said degrees in
curriculums not normally considered academic (i.e. Microsoft Access).
The private sector still likes the BA, BS, etc, though given the role of
technology in the economy, they would prefer these students to have
training in computers.  In some ways, the credential actually means more
there than it does in academia.

In any case, the cliche about the impracticality of a university education
is an old one.  Witness Eliot's Middlemarch, where Fred Vincy, once being
a minister is no longer a possibility as a career, goes to work for a
farmer, who complains that Oxford didn't teach him to write legibly.  In
other words, the complaint that a university education doesn't equip
students with practical skills is an old and hoary one.  Sure, there are
things that you learn in a university setting that have no outlet in the
so-called Real World, but this is because education is meant to be
General, not specific.  The trend towards ever more technical bachelor
degrees is an interesting one in this light, since it provides the
credential with the training.  It remains to be seen whether these
students, like those with certificates and AAs will find themselves
stymied.  (Though this trend is also indicative of the social need to
credential people, as can be seen by the doctorization of physical
therapists, pharmacists,etc.)

As for the teaching of writing, there are multiple reasons for this
problem.  First is that we live in a multicultural society which is slowly
moving away from the written word.  This means both that students come to
university who are not to the manner born in standard written
communication, but it also means that they come with different
communication abilities.  Some sort of quantifiable test will not tell you
this, particularly standardized tests geared towards standard written
English.  It is also because american high schools do not prioritize
writing as a skill, so that the onus of the training falls upon
universities.  Writing is difficult to learn because it is not a subject
in the way biology or algebra is. To think that even a year is sufficient
to train someone is pretty silly.  It's also because the teaching of
writing is resource intensive.  You can do (barely)  introductory classes
to academic subjects with 700 students, but you cannot teach writing in
this manner.  Universities do not typically get extra money to teach
fundamental skills, but rather have to perform delicate budget balancing
acts in order to fund what they do manage to teach.  And the same biz folk
who claim Johnny can't write want him to know computers, so extra money in
the system gets shunted to this sort of training.

The regard that higher ed is held in today has something to do with the
fact that you cannot please all of the people all of the time.
Universities are one of the great levellers and leg-uppers in this
society, and they are a very public one. Consequently, they become the
site of multiple desires.  This, more than anything else, explains
so-called political correctness.  Universities are held to a higher
standard than virtually any other institution in society, by the right and
the left.  Contrariwise, you can't attack the business world in the same
way because there is no center.  You can't blame poor math skills on
Microsoft.  My own opinion is that the private sector is basically
parasitic on higher education.  The call to raise standards and even the
money that comes from it to the university is some measure of how the
private sector knows that there is a limit to outsourcing.  Be that as
may, corporations do like to fund right-wing think tanks, full of their
own version of tenured radicals who fulminate in media friendly ways about
the trahison de clercs.  At least Allan Bloom was funny (one suspects his
anti-rock tirade was a parody).  His legion of followers are simply
boring, though they continue to get airplay via a media that knows full
and well the only competitor for their reflection of society is the
university.  Oh, and the quote about the teaching of writing is so off
base--teaching portfolios are part of the mantra these days--that "heated"
doesn't do it justice.  It's half-baked.

1. Howdy all following this thread about poetry and academic boogeymen!  I
myself have followed it as one follows the horizon line which fades
forever and forever when I move.  Though we are not now that GREAT POETRY
which rolled off tongues before ACADEMICS with pocket protectors dissected
us like so many 4th grade frogs, it may be we shall still touch happy
bookshelves!  Though much is taken (by THE ACADEMY), much abides.

2. (new voice) Poetry is equipment for living, as real as marriage (for
better or worse) and as observable as e-business.

3. (another) What the hell are we talking about here? Does anyone really
believe that academic criticism or "theory" is ruining poetry?? Did German
Idealism ruin Wordsworth?  Did Sidney ruin himself? Did Emerson ruin
Whitman?  Who shot J.R.?  Are the shoes of the fisherman's wife some
jive-ass slippers?  Did John Dewey ruin Williams and William James ruin
Stein?  Did Helene Cixous ruin me for any other man? Art thou a worm?  Is
this a worm? Go write your poems! Or I'll send you to bed without your E
True Hollywood Story.  If you don't need the Academy bully for you!  I
like VH1 Behind the Music too. Besides, only Susan Howe and Nathaniel
Mackey, of the American poet-academics are better than the VH1 behind the
music espisodes on Journey and Styx.  Why would Marjorie Perloff liking
your poems mean any more or less than your very bestest poet-buddy liking
them? Because she'll get you a job in THE ACADEMY?  Because she'll get you
a $10,000 prize thus allowing you to by the GOOD German bolgna instead of
the cheap Oscar Meyer?  Even  if such were true? Marjorie loves poetry and
poetry loves her, so be it.  I love poetry, so be it.  By the associative
principle I love Marjorie, so be it.   Poems are like a good BLANK:
they're always getting stuck in your BLANK.  I believe this is a very
positive step for the poetry world.

We use a peer review system where I work very intensively, but it has always
struck me that it is very different in the computer industry than it is in
the academy. On the occasions when I've seen others going through its
somewhat tortured process there, I've always been struck by the enormous
amount of turf-protection that seems to go on.

But while peer review often determines what gets accepted, the editor's
usually retain the ability to assign order, to determine which is perceived
as the "lead piece" in any given issue, etc.

So it's no surprise that the very best poetry journals over the years have
been those that have had deeply opinionated editors (it almost doesn't
matter WHICH opinion) who understood that both selection and presentation
order represents major critical statements of their own.

That's why, for example, the use of the alphabet to assign sequence in a
journal is almost always a failure -- it's a bureaucrat's democracy, rather
than an interactive one, an abdication of politics right at the point at
which editorial politics should enter in. Much better to put pieces into the
most cantankerous sequence you can imagine and then stand behind that.

While I've been thinking about the issues raised recently --
especially in conjunction with a discussion happening on a local
listserv happening someplace else, as well as, obviously, the one
happening here on this listserv about criticism vs. poetry and the
complicated discussion about academic cultures (I really hate to
characterize what has been a very interesting discussion) -- my post
wasn't more than a quick stab at one articulation of them.

Like Louis, I've newly returned to reading the writing posted here.
"I'm trying to orientate myself to the list and to its posters,"
Louis writes. Yes. Thanks for saying that. Who are these people on
the Poetics List? And even more troubling: Who am I? Where am I
coming from? I didn't want to write out a long  manifesto about
"abandoning poetry in order to return to poetry" - a phrase that
loses in everything in translation.

So the question of Politics comes out of a desire to have a sense of
where the furniture is in the room, so to speak.  The Political is
this floating set of values. For poets who criticize academics, there
is an implicit political or social value system often at work. This
is especially true of poetry and poetry criticism. I find it curious
that anyone would make political claims for the "kind" of poetry that
they write. I think it's great - even courageous - but even the most
explicit doggerel doesn't have the location it once had. And
certainly so-called "experimental forms" have lost whatever political
values they may have once had. For me, it's no longer about the
content of poetry, its style or compositional methodology, but rather
how it either gets implemented socially or how its implementation is
part of some other constitution of community (towards, hopefully
positive ends). An example for me would be the function of education
(including language and poetry studies) in the Civilian Public
Service camps in the 40s. Maria Damon would be an example of someone
who has done such work (thinking of a poetics of this sort in terms
of the young women in her book, Dark End of the Street). Many people
are involved in such projects such as teaching poetry in the schools,
or working in mental health clinics (as one writer to Factory School
talked about the importance of the audio achive for her purposes). In
the latter case, there is something being "built" which locates
poetry someplace for certain people. I'm being vague because I think
it's open-- Thinking about that or the function of education as an
"industry" -- an industry experiencing cutbacks, yes. I'm thinking of
a poetics which would engage the question of community and civic
development from a "green", pseudo-anarchist perspective. What does
that mean? I'm still struggling with it- and I hope I always am. Such
a poetics would have to think about economics in some real sense--so
yes, it makes sense that studying business one would study Marx. I
mean, my first day in college Roger Meiners (a noted Allen Tate
scholar) said: "Don't bother studying literature until you've studied
economics." These are not new arguments. But we *could* be
interpreters of economic conditions and their "impact" on the
construction of verse. For example, one might call Sept.11 "The End
of the Cibo Matto Era." But I'd rather be involved in rethinking how
the field of literature (which constitutes not only poets, but
critics, publishers, editors, and others, including high school and
composition teachers, etc.etc.) how this field can be understood in
the contemporary.

How people read and respond to that field is a lot of what we get
here. It's important and I've found the discussions useful. I'd like
to see how people frame these things, and in so I think I'm echoing
some of Louis' sentiments when he asks how people "view their own
views". That's why I think the direct statement is useful.

Lately I've been going to poetry slams, because there I find
something extremely different from "on campus" poetry (of whatever
camp), which seems lifeless and often begins with the presumption
that I will sit still for half-an-hour regardless of what I'm
subjected to. In that sense- I'm drifting away from the doxic
piousness of academic verse culture. ["If you cut me do I not bleed?"
why shouldn't bad poetry made us sigh or moan?] In Ithaca, these slam
events are a long way from the glamor of the big city slam scenes.
Here there is a wide range of purpose. For some it is "coming out" to
their peers with great explicitness. Many of the poems are not even
typed--and they are communicating immediately in a discursive field
that, while not my cup of tea exactly, is very interesting to study.
Some get up there, trembling like leafs as much as boldly telling GWB
to fuckoff, etc., and there is a sense of additive construction
happening. Sadly, I'm not a part of it. But would I want to be? I
really can't stand the painful attention to a rather strict and
confining formalism that motivates the verse style, and there is
often an unreflective quality to the poetry that I find only ironic
in the bad sense. (A critique which mirrors my critique of most
so-called "Language Poetry".) My point is that these poems are often
posed "politically", whether micro high school politics or the
anti-govt tirade-poem (ditto LangPo) - and if I had the entre into
such a discussion, I would love to ask them the question I've asked
here. And it has caused me to rethink my politics and thus my
relation to various social formations. blahblahblah town-gown (as an
ethnic townie who now works for a university/govt). Finally, it does
not matter whether I like the poetry or not. I am trying to find my
place in that community, and perhaps there isn't one (I often feel
this way on campus, as well, frankly). In both contexts, I don't feel
I'd even be given the slightest hearing -- though I've thought of
writing a "slam poetry lecture" -- versifying in that cheezy slamway
a straight-laced lecture on the limits of such strict rhythmic
formalism and the often authoritarian way such poems not fitting into
the form are "judged" by the community - causing a real landslide
towards conformity among the one group that seems to value
'difference' the most.

My sense - and this is why I asked - is that this is a latent
community which could really accomplish something. Must it? Is it
required? Of course not. For all the humor of Kasey's post, his barb
is well-taken. Why should anyone wish answer such an open question,
offensive or not? I guess I'm wondering: if I'm going to stay here
and continue, I'd like to see what's happening, what's not happening;
what's possible and what's not.  It seems from posts like those of
Louis' and others recently that a spirit could move the list - at
least in some quarters (since there is no totality at all possible
nor desirable anyhow) to manifest some of the opportunity provided by
the architecture of the space.  What would that look like? One
project I have in mind is the networked group construction of a "free
textbook" and I've hesitated to bring the possibility of that
activity of this space, which often seems to have a fixed mode of
purpose and conduct attached to it.

Frankly, I'm not even sure such things are possible on such a large
scale - and in any case, when I have a sense of an answer to my own
question, I'll post it. As it is, I have to go offline for a couple
days.

cheers,

I don't know, Jeffrey. Your implication that "thinking" is equivalant to
"education" is a dangerous one, in my opinion.  How about thinking with the
body, with the soul; through meditation, through singing, through sex. Or
through experience. Wherefore wisdom?  Your logic reduces thought to what
can be had through education, and that, for me, is borderline crazytalk.

I often remember Ashbery's line, "In school all the thought got combed out."

Say what, bro?

(Does this have to do with bad breath (breath is bad model of poetic
production), you know like speech vs. writing, or is it an ethno-porno thing?)

Yo,

During the summer I'm teaching a class on the function of the author photo in
20th-century poetic production. Some questions I have: What theoretical texts
would be helpful in thinking the author photo? Are author photos commodified
and could an author photo subvert its own commodification? Also how does the
placement of an author photo (back cover, inner back, front) determine a
text's reception and dissemination? What are the advantages and disadvantages
of an author photo? Is not using an author photo a more virtuous form of
bodily representation and identity-making than using one? What are the
expressive categories that make up the range of possibilities as determined
by the current ideology of author photos: angry, intense, blank, happy,
melancholic, wistful, young, old, staring off to one side, with or without
hat, just the face or the whole body, silly or serious, long hair or short
hair, sunglasses or no sunglasses, cleavage or no cleavage, chest hair or no
chest hair, naked or clothed, standing up or sitting down, etc etc. And, just
for fun, what are some of your favorite author photos?

(Chris, make sure you reply in verse, otherwise I won't read it)

<DIV></DIV>&gt;Date: Thu, 9 May 2002 22:07:27 -0500
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Hello,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Originally I backchanneled this, but I'll go ahead and post it.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I agree with Jeff's implication that that we are "denying something here,"
<DIV></DIV>&gt;but it's not just a problem of disconnection between the academic writing
<DIV></DIV>&gt;and poetry, or even the academy and art; I think it's between the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;educational system and society. Especially humanities programs seem content
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to allow themselves to drift away from those who not only pay the bills but
<DIV></DIV>&gt;hope to become better educated through it. A literary "education" seems
<DIV></DIV>&gt;reserved for a class of skeptics who can talk in a certain code-language.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Those willing to participate in a complicated power game. Hence the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;development of the ubiquitous "business school." (Who would want to be
<DIV></DIV>&gt;around us? Businesspeople may not understand Ashbery, but they are
<DIV></DIV>&gt;contemplative enough to know when they aren't learning anything useful.)
<DIV></DIV>&gt;No, humanities departments aren't training people to integrate academic
<DIV></DIV>&gt;knowledge with life, to see the relevance of literature to society, or
<DIV></DIV>&gt;giving them the resources to become better people (one of the earliest
<DIV></DIV>&gt;missions of an English education was moral improvement).
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;One site of this "crisis" for English depts is composition, since every
<DIV></DIV>&gt;student has to take it. Here are the first two paragraphs from an article I
<DIV></DIV>&gt;ran across years ago in Public Interest called "Why Johnny Can't Write"--
<DIV></DIV>&gt;admittedly it's a bit heated--
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;"American employers regard the nation's educational system as an
<DIV></DIV>&gt;irrelevance, according to a Census Bureau survey released in February of
<DIV></DIV>&gt;this year. Businesses ignore a prospective employee's educational
<DIV></DIV>&gt;credentials in favor of his or her work history and attitude. Although the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;census researchers did not venture any hypotheses for this strange behavior,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;anyone familiar with the current state of academia could have provided
<DIV></DIV>&gt;explanations aplenty.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;"One overlooked corner of the academic madhouse bears in particular on
<DIV></DIV>&gt;graduates' job-readiness--the teaching of writing. In the field of writing,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;today's education is not just an irrelevance, it is positively detrimental
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to a student's development. For years, composition teachers have absorbed
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the worst strains in both popular and academic culture. The result is an
<DIV></DIV>&gt;indigestible stew of 1960s liberationist zeal, 1970s deconstructivist
<DIV></DIV>&gt;nihilism, and 1980s multicultural proselytizing. The only thing that
<DIV></DIV>&gt;composition teachers are not talking and writing about these days is how to
<DIV></DIV>&gt;teach students to compose clear, logical prose."
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I would like to affirm Philip Nikolayev's statement that the "poetry scene"
<DIV></DIV>&gt;is as full of infighting and political bullshit as the academic world. Both
<DIV></DIV>&gt;"scenes" also have their deserving stars, those who plow through the BS and
<DIV></DIV>&gt;focus on what's at hand.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I enjoy writing criticism, but I don't write much prose my mom can't
<DIV></DIV>&gt;understand on first reading (the poetry--eh hem--is another matter). Down
<DIV></DIV>&gt;with blocky obscurantist academese, and those assistant professors who write
<DIV></DIV>&gt;it! Down with specialism!
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;My goal is to give a successful poetry reading at a truckstop in outstate
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Missouri.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Best to all,

Robert,

Sorry to give rise to your intemperance, but your response was anything but
intemperate. Thanks for historicizing the "crisis" in what appears to be a
voice of experience; especially helpful was your final paragraph.

Aside: We're moving away from talking about criticism v. poetry.  I concur
with Michael Magee's post about criticism.  It can be mesmerizing but is no
threat to the self-assured poet. Love it, lap it up.  I read it myself and
certainly also write it with aplomb (how savvy my "criticism" is is another
question). (What is criticism?)

Anyway, Robert, you're right that Ashbery don't enter the picture for
undergrads, and that most profs don't intentionally "complexify" the picture
for them; teaching writing is not a simple business. You're also right that
ambiguity is a good thing, but I think it needs reference points. Perhaps
this is what Louis means when he asks about "status quo".  Am I appealing to
some kind of "status quo"?  I don't know. I would like a foundation of
"clear, logical prose" for students before they take on ambiguity.

"Any schoolboy could see that man as force must be measured by motion from a
fixed point." --Henry Adams

A fixed point. Somehow students need the tools before they begin working on
the subjects. My thought has been that English profs, distracted with MLA
concerns and department politics, have needlessly complicated their own task
in the classroom. Bachelor's degree-seekers want a layperson's guide to
novels and poetry; possibly even some lasting appreciation for these things;
they want to know how to write "clear, logical prose."  Teaching them these
things is no easy task, but it's not made easier by the forces mentioned in
"Why Johnny Can't Write."

Best to all,

E.B. White

<DIV></DIV>&gt;1. Howdy all following this thread about poetry and academic boogeymen! I
<DIV></DIV>&gt;myself have followed it as one follows the horizon line which fades
<DIV></DIV>&gt;forever and forever when I move. Though we are not now that GREAT POETRY
<DIV></DIV>&gt;which rolled off tongues before ACADEMICS with pocket protectors dissected
<DIV></DIV>&gt;us like so many 4th grade frogs, it may be we shall still touch happy
<DIV></DIV>&gt;bookshelves! Though much is taken (by THE ACADEMY), much abides.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;2. (new voice) Poetry is equipment for living, as real as marriage (for
<DIV></DIV>&gt;better or worse) and as observable as e-business.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;3. (another) What the hell are we talking about here? Does anyone really
<DIV></DIV>&gt;believe that academic criticism or "theory" is ruining poetry?? Did German
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Idealism ruin Wordsworth? Did Sidney ruin himself? Did Emerson ruin
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Whitman? Who shot J.R.? Are the shoes of the fisherman's wife some
<DIV></DIV>&gt;jive-ass slippers? Did John Dewey ruin Williams and William James ruin
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Stein? Did Helene Cixous ruin me for any other man? Art thou a worm? Is
<DIV></DIV>&gt;this a worm? Go write your poems! Or I'll send you to bed without your E
<DIV></DIV>&gt;True Hollywood Story. If you don't need the Academy bully for you! I
<DIV></DIV>&gt;like VH1 Behind the Music too. Besides, only Susan Howe and Nathaniel
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Mackey, of the American poet-academics are better than the VH1 behind the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;music espisodes on Journey and Styx. Why would Marjorie Perloff liking
<DIV></DIV>&gt;your poems mean any more or less than your very bestest poet-buddy liking
<DIV></DIV>&gt;them? Because she'll get you a job in THE ACADEMY? Because she'll get you
<DIV></DIV>&gt;a $10,000 prize thus allowing you to by the GOOD German bolgna instead of
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the cheap Oscar Meyer? Even if such were true? Marjorie loves poetry and
<DIV></DIV>&gt;poetry loves her, so be it. I love poetry, so be it. By the associative
<DIV></DIV>&gt;principle I love Marjorie, so be it. Poems are like a good BLANK:
<DIV></DIV>&gt;they're always getting stuck in your BLANK. I believe this is a very
<DIV></DIV>&gt;positive step for the poetry world.

Dear Joel, and all,
I do not feel either comfortable or concise enough to write the requested
paragraph, or to post it here. I presume some of my politics, personality,
readerly and writerly concerns and interests, etc, have come through over
the course of my sometime-involvement on this list, and will continue to do
so.

Hi David,

>What theoretical texts would be helpful in thinking the author photo?

http://www.midwestbookreview.com/bookbiz/advice/photo.htm

Also, Barrett Watten supposedly presented somewhere a piece apparently
critiquing a cover for the SPD catalog I did, where I drew pics of poets.
The rumor I heard was that he made some kind of relationship between those
pics or how they were being used and the Mickey Mouse Club. I've always
wanted to read it, in part to see if it really was as critical as the rumors
had it, but also of course to see what the specific criticism might be. (I'm
hoping he'll read this and e-mail it to me.) Anyway, my guess is that while
not strictly about the author photo, it obviously was about the visual
presentation of authors -- so is probably something you might want to ask
him to e-mail to you, too.

I have a lot of favorite author photos. Thinking about them, I realize what
an amazing range of types there are:

See the many books in the case behind my head? I have read and am familiar
with each of them.

I am a survivor. My hunched back and the rings under my eyes do testify.

I do not need to shave, brush my teeth, comb my hair, change my clothing,
nor eat ... for, poetry sustains me!

When this photo was taken, I was unaware, so lost in thought was I.

Here I am in the city. It's a big, scary city. I make this big, scary city
my home. You, reading my poety in the hinterlands, you do not know this
city!

I am white, my turtleneck black.

Of course I'll have sex with you. Why else would I pose like this?

Having finished carefully crafting each of the poems in this collection, I
have rolled back down the sleeves of my Pendleton.

Yes, that is X, the famous poet, next to me. We are on speaking terms!

Obviously, I am insane. Colorful anecdotes of my unbalanced nature precede
me. The wind blows through my hair ... O, poetry!

Subject:      Summer prose workshop dates
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Hi,

I finally figured out the dates for my summer prose workhops.  I'm
going to be out of town a lot the beginning of the summer, so I have
to begin the workshops a bit later in the summer than I'd hoped.

I'm planning to do 2 sections this summer--a Monday night 7 to 10,
and a Saturday afternoon 1:30 to 4:30.  The Monday night one will be
11 weeks.  The Saturday afternoon one will be 10 weeks, plus a
private consultation for each student.  There will be a combined
reading for both groups the week of September 16.

Here's the dates:

Summer Monday (7 to 9):
June 24
July 8 - September 9

Summer Saturday (1:30-4:30):
July 13 - September 14

The workshops are totally open-ended.  Usually 5 people present a
week, scheduling that the week ahead.  Usually people bring in
something 5 pages or less (copies for everybody) and we critique it
that week.  Longer pieces are also okay, but they need to be handed
out a week ahead of time for people to read.  Each student typically
gets a half an hour each time we critique.  The classes are limited
to 8 students.  Lots and lots of personal attention.  They take place
in my South of Market apartment, which comes complete with snacks and
two cats.

If you're interested, please write me backchannel about pricing and
work samples.  I'll need a deposit by June 10.

Thanks.

Dodie

Twixt perusing this thread on the poetix-list & correcting papers for my
hackademic job, an email brought news of the latest issue of the Boston
Review, which starts with a piece on a new Heany Book. Here are the first
couple paragraphs (the rest at the following url:
http://bostonreview.mit.edu/BR14.4/sleigh.html) -- they seem to feed into
some of what's been worried about here, at least in relation to the
successful mainstream. In fact the piece is as close to an unconscious
parody of its own milieu it is possible to come -- Pierre

In Rough Waters


Seamus Heaney steers a middle course.

Tom Sleigh



"The trouble with criticism," as Robert Lowell once remarked, "is that it
makes points." Fueled by Seamus Heaney’s rich and strange inner life, The
Government of the Tongue transcends this judgment. These essays, composed
with a seemingly casual vigor over the course of almost ten years, mesh and
well with the authority of obsession. They make an informal ars poetica, one
designed to propel the poet into a more broadly imagined artistic future.
But most important of all, writing of this caliber signals an effort at
self-transformation, a longing for the authority and self-sufficiency of
what Yeats called the finished man among his enemies.

Heaney’s concern to square art with life makes the book a welcome throw-back
to essayists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Like Hazlitt or
Lamb, Heaney places insightful personal reminiscence alongside literary
analysis. The effect is a kind of darting, rolled-sleeve alertness that lets
you feel the force of Heaney’s emotional and intellectual life. In
comparison, most contemporary "methodologies" and "theorizings" have their
veins bulging in their foreheads. By straining so hard, they tend to miss
why people actually read poetry, much less write it. But Heaney’s essays on
Patrick Kavanagh, Robert Lowell, and Sylvia Plath are as good as his own
best poems.

poets obviously should move in retro occasion to the mere thought that,
after the spoken word enters the condition of a truckstop, where trucks are
potentially indicated AS trucks, so that the work, curiously ardent by leaps
and bounds, tho not proof against all sorts of assertions (see NYTimes
TODAY!), but offering awfully good news too, whistling into the breach that
allows more
moons to be into the system (use of surreptiousness) by which success,
understood but not explained (who needs underlings?), that archangel we've
all been hinting at can repel thoroughly motivated steps at that dogmatic
ideal, nuzzling being a proper expression of warmth TOWARDS, while meanwhile
we are sure (aren't we?) of our caboose, the trailing idea, since it is
trained to get it, foresting plains with immediate pleasure, albeit which
tribes are moved is always a question. the point, then, masked as a
painkiller, but more likely a career, fits into this box, which is often
called our friend. cheers to all, Allen

More Author Photo Emblemata:

You think you know wintry vistas of grief, sonny?  You ain't never worn my
shoes.

Poetry, especially mine, is a complex metaphysics of shadows and longing,
the pondering of which causes me to be almost unbearably attractive.

Here at this renowned institution of higher learning, we take pride in our
appearance.  That means blow-drying and regular visits to the dentist!

I'm too busy doing important social work to stop and have my picture taken,
but fine, just get it over with.

My expressionlessness is just one more empty sign waiting to be
ideologically colonized.  To pretend otherwise is absurd.

If I were afraid to show you my dirty pores and nostril hairs in close-up, I
might be afraid to write my searingly honest, unsparing brand of poetry.
Thank god neither is the case!

Attention poets, critics and philosophers. Fulcrum: an annual of poetry =
and aesthetics is now open to unsolicited submissions of poetry and =
essays. The theme of our forthcoming (2003) issue will be "Philosophies =
of Poetry."

For Issue 2, we are looking for philosophical essays about poetry - =
generalized, deep reflections on the nature of poetry, poetic form and =
vision, the meaning of the poetic art. Although we use the term =
"philosophy" somewhat broadly (we may even consider essays on the =
"physics" or "mathematics of poetry" if they make any sense), we are not =
looking for literary criticism as such for the 2003 issue. If you had to =
explain what you think is most essential about poetry, and why (and how) =
poetry matters to you, what would you say? Have you got philosophic =
ideas or observations about poetry that you have always wanted to =
formulate, but never found a suitable occasion? (This brief description =
is for orientation purposes only.)

Poetry submissions are not required to conform to the issue's central =
theme directly. We would especially caution poets against sending us =
"metapoetry" (pensive poetry about poetry). Please feel free, however, =
to send us your best, "representative" work, such as you feel most =
accurately captures your thinking and your worth as a poet.

Please note that Fulcrum does not publish book reviews.

All submitted work will be considered collegially. Please send =
unsolicited submissions between June 1 and August 31 to Fulcrum, 334 =
Harvard Street, Suite D-2, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. Include a return =
envelope with sufficient postage or IRCs if a response is desired. All =
regions of the English-speaking world are welcome, and all established =
regional and orthographic conventions are acceptable. No email =
submissions. Accepted work will be requested in an electronic format. No =
payment for unsolicited contributions except in copies.=20

Reading a sample issue before submitting work is strongly recommended. =
Fulcrum is a genuinely international journal. Contributors to Issue One =
(256 pages): Douglas Barbour (Canada), Ken Bolton (Australia), Pam Brown =
(Australia), Branston Clark (Belize and USA), Fred D'Aguiar (Guyana, =
England, USA), Allen Fisher (England), Randolph Healy (Ireland), Brian =
Henry (USA), W. N. Herbert (Scotland), Peter Horn (South Africa), Robert =
Kelly (USA), David Kennedy (England), John Kinsella (Australia), August =
Kleinzahler (USA), Alan Loney (New Zealand), Roddy Lumsden (Scotland, =
England), Paul Muldoon (Northern Ireland, USA), Gregory O'Brien (New =
Zealand), Marjorie Perloff (USA), Sheenagh Pugh (Wales), Menka =
Shivdasani (India), Matvei Yankelevich (USA), Angeline Yap (Singapore), =
Harriet Zinnes (USA).

Subscription rates in the U.S. are $12 per issue/year for individuals, =
$15 for institutions. Foreign subscriptions are $17 and $20 =
respectively. $5 discount for a three-year subscription. Fulcrum needs =
your financial support and welcomes philanthropic donations. A check or =
money order payable to Fulcrum Annual should be sent to Fulcrum, 334 =
Harvard Street, Suite D-2, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

sounds great brandon, but how do we get the work recognized as
advancoing our research profile if the thing isn't officially
recognized as a peer reviewed journal?

and maybe you can't be a poet these days, and maybe you could never
be a poet, without referring to or being informed by the contemporary
theories of the day.

and what followed language poetry?
what movements have there been since langpo?

oops a mixed bag of questions i've had over the last three weeks of
ubpoetics but haven't been configured correctly to post

Love this conversation, and here are my contributions,
with the special added bonus of my very "gendered"
concerns:

My hair is very full and long and somewhat ethnic.
This means I am romantic, haunted, and I am a
obviously a Woman Poet.

My extremely impressive educational pedigree is offset
by my posing in nondescript clothing in this gritty
landscape.

The lovely child I embrace indicates that I have a
life other than my poetry...so there.

My many beloved animals lapping at my hands indicate
that I may or may not have a life outside my
poetry...so there.

By turning my face three quarteres away from the
camera, I am either a) trying to deflect the power of
my utterly staggering beauty or b) trying to deflect
my own insecurity over my age/weight/appearance or c)
trying to look artsy.

-----
But I say this all with total compassion, because I am
in the midst of trying to make an author photo for my
own first book, and I mean really, is there such a
thing as a "good" or "neutral" author photo?  If you
do look Attrative and Normal, you seem guilty of
glamorizing yourself.  If you don't look Attractive or
Normal...well, then you don't.

My current choice for author photo is a black and
white Polariod in which I am slightly smiling, looking
away, and very much hidden by shadow.  But it was one
of the only photos where I don't look totally
uncomfortable.

I would like to hear people actually name names of
author photos they like, so I'll start.  I love
Claudia Rankine's photo on the back of _Plot_: she
looks lovely and open and is genuinely smiling.  And I
like Kim Lyons' photo-booth film strip of herself with
her son in which, again, she looks genuinely happy.
Others?

Okay, I avoided all temptation to make an
intervention in the discussion about UC
Press, though I was the poetry editor (among
other things) there, left under duress and in
disgust, and have plenty of thoughts about the
matter—

But I can't resist chiming in here, since you
sweetly and rightly mention the wonderful
author photo of Claudia Rankine on the back
cover of Plot. I provided (made) the collage
Grove (and the brilliant book designer) used
for the front cover of Plot ("boy with a squint, at
Kew Gardens," or so I like to imagine), and I
love the way Claudia's portrait  (in
black-and-white, glossy against the matte
background) rhymes with the front cover and
the black-and-white boys in it, who
are—somehow—just being themselves, as
Claudia is, somehow, confounding discourse
and disenchantment and self-consciousness,
HERSELF on the backcover of her book.

Real happiness is radical, nowhere more so
than in author photos and on poets' faces.

Re: author photos: Broaden the genre,
maybe?—think of the singer in the band
Dealership, jumping on a bed on the cover of
their first (I think) album . . . Cast aside your
old tired (a)esthetics, perhaps, and go beyond
the visage of genius in a small rectangle?
Think Sidney Bechet AND his sidemen? I
propose this abstractly, of course, sure that
whatever author photo you (whoever you are)
are prepared to provide your publisher, it will
be—fine, maybe better than fine!

Does anyone remember who wrote the piece
about Avedon's portaiture that appeared in
Grand Street some years (maybe ten years)
ago? Interesting things about the face of
painter Francis Bacon in there. Think
Rembrandt, seeing the term, the life span of
each individual life in each face he painted—
Think—postage stamps.

How's that for an approach to what is basically
a publicity still?

How to address the aesthetics of ephemeral
statuary?

1. My view is a dim one of my views. But, like a good Sartrean cosmonaut,
here goes the wobbly eye.


2a. I tend to want to envision the listserv as an outrageously, flagrantly
utopic, reflexively present-tense enactment (or set of -s). This view's been
steady-as-it-goes, since my very first post (what a grunt!).

b. I am the extreme minority in holding such a listserv view. My minority
status on the issue has for the most part always been so. "I" am the last
lingering trace here of a former boiling 'pulse'. But, flarf we must.

c. The lackluster e-ception that my Planned Utopia has received, fellow
cosmonauts, reflects significant differences between us! [*Would the
delegate from the central provinces please rise and state his case.*] These
differences "speak," in my case, to a historical relationship I hold with
this listserv (back to 1996 -- yet for others, to the Big Bang itself) --
which should pass for an acknowledgement of how Language poets had the
impact of a tsunami over me growing up in the '80s in surfless sands of
seams ("White out there!").

d. "Now... just... hold on.... What has 2a -- 'planned social utopia' -- to
do with the latter part of 2c, 'Language poetry'?! I have no idea how
'utopic social collective critique' connects to LP! I've never read anything
like that in the histories of this messily indefinable grouping of poets,
critics, itinerant thinkers ....”

e. (So much to write about...so little about time!) Actually, I feel
enormously happy for you, d. Still, poetry "moments," when they occur, do
invoke the socially utopic -- for a time, anyway.


3a. Language poetry doesn't pose the social crisis for poetry today, as it
(once) posed the crisis of poetry for Chris S (or Kent Johnson, among others
here and elsewhere). This is *not* news. What *is* recent news, to me at
least, is that LP seems to have become a Palgrave's Anthology for the 21C,
neat-o cool stuff that is "different" from the Palgrave's Anthology of the
19C -- and yet purchasable as a set! Dichten = Condensare...

b. As much as I loathe to bring this up once again, the beginning of a
self-satisfyingly comfortable and settled indifference to LP began to
express itself specifically on this list with -- HG. That is *partly* (only
partly) why his perfectly even-tempered, nice and witty posts incited such a
suppressed furor, I believe -- his was an untimely meditation, his the
fully-achieved Null Point far ahead of its time! -- which is to acknowledge
that I and others were partly to blame (yet with no regrets!) for what
resulted, since "we" had, then, a different agenda for the listserv. -- Even
though, as I say, I mostly lurked, and did not discuss any of this with
others backchannel -- AND NOW DO YOU SEE how an ideology of social utopic
critique hailed me like a great white bird, only too well, friend?? But, let
me lean on you just awhile longer, please let me tell you my story to the
end! ("You're fucking wedding can wait!!").


4a. "If poetry is the mole of history, what am I doing on this listserv!"

b. Aaron Bombeck doesn’t know...


5. "There are worse fates."


6a. Now go, play with your letters, and come back with a happy, a-social,
Oulipo utopia of one -- befitting The Computer Age.

b. "Cosmonaut! your nephew's cat is nick-named Turd -- The plastic pink
pencil case you took to public school is keepsaked in a $5 ply mini-dresser
bought off a construction boss you had once, he was not a stingy flint but a
junk dealer too -- You have seen your favorite cartoon now, Rocky &
Bullwinkle, once, and that was last week, it's nice to know the experience
of having a favorite for moments that beckon their recognition, like this
one -- Your shoes, hand-me-downs from Dad's only serious, persistent
clothing expenditure, his search for the best custom shoes for flat feet --
Your favorite author photo, David Hess playing a joke on ubpoetics --"

How did you know all this?!

"I am the future of the past you will now no longer need, cosmonaut! Harken
to the sound! There, just there, something new, there -- just over
there!!!!!! It is yet faint! indistinguishable! but, for you! You must leave
now, and disappear.”

Louis, I hate to say this (as obviously it would undermine the entire pupose
of this listserve) but L+A+N+G+U+A+G+E Poetry is a dead-in-the-water small
puddle in the outer margins of Boonbooks, USA.

Nobody cares, and even fewer notice.

To deploy the Palgrave analogy is specious.  (And jesus god bloody wept --
Palgrave!!  This IS the 21st century -- couldn't we at least flash Norton,
if we're playing canonical anthologies?)

But (to return to the point) ...

The sole remaining minor element of interest in the total fiasco is the
minor gossip around who was bounced when from Buffalo.  And over +that+,
even FEWER care.

<sigh>

K, I inhabit a small island 3,000 moles away on the off-shore of Europe ...

Which might give some perspective.

But when did American Poetry cease being relevant?

You HAD to pay attention when it was Eliot/ (dichten)Pound / Stevens /
Williams.  Or the flash confessionals -- Lowell, Berryman, Plath and Sexton.
Or even (he's I believe still alive) Ashberry.

But (save my shame) where does Bernstein and LangPo rate in this?

When I had more than two brain cells to rub together, I contemplated an
article on Internet Lists Considered From the Perspective Of Primate
Territoriality.

All lists reflect the "dear enemy" phenomenon, and particularly inept lists
(subsubpoetics in its meltdown days was a fairly classic example) can be
analysed in terms of noyau.

Noyau is supposed to be +the+ most primitive primate territorial grouping.
But [analogically] Poetics (Buffalo) drops even below +that+ radar -- you
can't analogise it.

The last silverbacked gorilla beating its chest vainly against the moon in
Tasmasnia?  Maybe.

William,

Not trying to redefine anything; only to point out that the kind of
"electrical surges" that you say comprise thinking are also "educated" (to
return to Jeffrey's word) in sex, contemplation, and other activities that
are not taught in school. Perhaps we would agree that art-making is often
like sexual intercourse. For as you say, "one is always and only thinking
with the body."

My point was to correct Jeffrey's statement that "a better-educated ~person~
is in a better position to write."

Happy saturdays all around;

Aaron

For no fathomable reason, I have always wanted, in the author photo of my
eventual (please, please, please) first book, to be using my teeth to feed
a Ritz cracker to a crow or raven. Cracker brand is actually optional;
it's just that the round ones seem to me more aesthetically pleasing than,
say, a square saltine. But the bird definitely has to be a Corvus
brachyrhynchos or C. corax.

Yes, and I suggest a Jeffrey Jullich Prize for Maturity in Poetry
established, too.

For poets who criticize academics, there is an implicit political or social
value system often at work. This is especially true of poetry and poetry
criticism. I find it curious that anyone would make political claims for the
'kind' of poetry that they write. I think it's great - even courageous - but
even the most explicit doggerel doesn't have the location it once had. And
certainly so-called 'experimental forms' have lost whatever political values
they may have once had. For me, it's no longer about the content of poetry,
its style or compositional methodology, but rather how it either gets
implemented socially or how its implementation is part of some other
constitution of community (towards, hopefully positive ends).

This is Absoultely Fabulous! Poetry for me is not about the poem anymore
either. It's about the 'constitution of community'.

By the way, you didn't have to tell us you were a Marxist. We could tell by
your tone.

Someone reply to Jeff Hamilton's post, it's the most reasonable and honest
one so far!,

I can't say that I can say (or give a name to) any post-langpo movements,
but I've got a couple thoughts about langpo/post-langpo.  To partially
answer your question though -- I'd recommend _Telling it Slant_ ed. by Mark
Wallace and Steven Marks.  It's a good collection of poets writing about
poetics who I'd describe as post-langpo (second generation langpo?)  Though
before I start calling people names I'd like to throw in my definition of
langpo cuz I can.  The terms "Language Poets" and "Language Poetry" are
really short hand for "L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Magazine Poets/Poetry."  As many
have pointed out in the discussion thus far, a unified vision does not
define the group.  Instead what defines the group is their participation in
a specific little journal (I may be repeating something somebody already
said.)  Another definition might include something bland like "and
dedicated to challenging accepted norms", but that's vague and not
particularly useful (couldn't that definition be applied to Britney
Spears?)  So when people ask what langpo is of course the response is "well
-- it's kinda sorta this, but kinda sorta that, but you just kinda gotta
know."  It may be a more useful discussion to try to break the term
"langpo" into smaller categories (though I'm not a big fan of spending time
classifying writing into genus and species (seems like a way to avoid
dealing with what the stuff is actually saying (like separating criminals
and not being shocked by their crimes, just making sure that all the
murderers go here, forgers there, embezzlers next door.)))  So part of the
reason I recommend _Telling it Slant_ is cuz it does a good job of
presenting a variety of poetic approaches (by no means complete, but the
book doesn't pursue completion) by writers that were affected by and are
the generation after the langpo phenomenon.

There's been a lot of movement since langpo, but the movements probably
won't be named for awhile.

For heaven's sake, Dave, slow down and read more carefully!  And stop being
so rude!  When Joel says "it's no longer about the content of poetry," "it"
refers merely to the question of the political specificity of forms.  He's
just saying that whereas you might once have been able to gauge a poet's
politics by virtue of the fact that she writes in, say, New Sentences, or
heroic couplets, or haiku, or whatever, that's no longer possible.
Postmodern proliferation of techniques has generated an ideologically
unknowable geography.  Your certainty that Joel's tone is "Marxist" (unless
your irony is double, and _I'm_ the one who's totally missing _your_ point,
which is always a possibility) shows that you haven't adapted to this fact.
Shared vocabularies no longer mean shared politics.

I feel partly responsible for this silliness because of my initial reply to
Joel's post, which was meant to be read as a tongue-in-cheek travesty of my
own occasional insecurities that I might be perceived as an ineffectual
"fellow traveler"--not by Joel, and not in such a way as to suggest that
Joel's post had as its intention the kind of Stalinist interrogation I was
pretending to react to, but just on a unilateral paranoid level (these are
feelings that I of course realize are absurd, and hence the travesty).  My
fear is that your belief that you can tell Joel is a Marxist from his "tone"
really stems from your reading my post, which you might have interpreted as
"insinuating" such a thing.  Not that it would be bad if Joel _were_ a
Marxist, which, as far as I know, for what it's worth, he's not, at least in
any doctrinaire way.  But for me to offer this disavowal in Joel's name is
already to succumb to a kind of implied McCarthyism, which is exactly the
atmosphere I want this thread not to invoke.

Oh my god, this is dumb.  Can we go back to the semiotics of author photos?

K.

Picturing Ourselves
Photography and Autobiography
by Linda Haverty Rugg

Published by the University of Chicago Press=20

<The nineteenth-century invention of photography and its proliferation did =
in some sense spawn a "disturbance to civilization" (as Barthes would have =
it), and part of my task in the following pages will be to examine the =
transformation of self-image and self-writing in the face of photographs =
of the self. But it may be more accurate to say that photographs, which =
can display many views and variant versions of the same person, simply =
supply a visual metaphor for the divided and multiple ("decentered") self, =
a self-image that gained momentum from Kierkegaard to Nietzsche to Freud =
and beyond. Photography did not create the disturbance; photographic =
technology, like other human inventions, offers an extension and =
realization of already-imagined images. At the same time, however, =
photographs as physical evidence re-anchor the subject in the physical =
world, insist on the verifiable presence of an embodied and solid =
individual. If, as practicing poststructuralists, we would like to =
discount photography's evidential power, we should remind ourselves of the =
small army of photographic selves that verify our status and agency in the =
world on passports, drivers' licenses, and so on.>

Immanent Visitor
Selected Poems of Jaime Saenz A Bilingual Edition

Translated from the Spanish by Kent Johnson and Forrest Gander

Immanent Visitor is the first English-language translation of the work of=20
Bolivia's greatest and most visionary twentieth-century poet. A po=E8te=20
maudit, Jaime Saenz rejected the conventions of polite society and became a=

politics, a denizen of slum taverns, unashamedly bisexual, insistently=20

destitute, the desperate, and the disenfranchised of that unreal city, La=
 Paz.

In long lines, in odes that name desire, with Whitmanesque anaphora, in=20

Ian, do you think Ashbery incapable of ordering the poems and
then wording the titles so as to run alphabetically? Wouldn't

Subject:      phenomenology of approach - conclusion
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

(apologies for the length of this - Alan)
-


(the closing of the work)


    the phenomenology of approach


    = approaching the everglades, the city, illness, language, culture =

a text written in spurts, after the outline, chasing down, encapsulating,
circumventing. what is an approach? how does approach manifest itself to
the subject? what is the domain of the approach? what is a domain? what is
subjectivity? what is its presence and loss?

     0  intermittent text
the text of dispersal. sections are written into and out of the outline.
the text is governed by the outline. subsequent versions increase the
quantitative content, refine the tolerance of the investigation. the text
is an accumulation or collocation of interspersions.

     1  domain limited or unlimited
a limited domain is inscribed with or without fuzzy boundaries. domains
may be limited in sememe, space, and/or time. example: everglades bounded
by hydrology, ecosystem. for example (below): everglades younger than
writing, than human inscription. for example (below): the scribble:
scribbled note, indecipherable handwriting, noise in the machine. the
state/meant of the domain is always already a delimitation. (limits are
closed sets in relation to the rest of the world/s, worlding.)

     2  clues and cues from immemorial past
a clue is an interpretable symptom, according to a scheme based on an
articulated methodology. a cue is the activation of a scheme based on an
anomaly or repetitive structure within the domain. the domain in turn may
be defined by clues and cues.

     3  difference between clues and cues
a clue is based on evidence from the past to the present; a cue is based
on activation within the present.

     4  relevance theory and approach
clues and cues are such by virtue of relevance; theoretical methodology is
part of a critical sifting apparatus. relevance is already a complex
construct, ranging from variegated retinal firings to stratifications of
attention.

     5  top-down classification schema
this follows for example category theory, chaos/fractal theories; one
always already begins with pre-theoretic presuppositions. the schemes
obscure as well as clarify; they override heuristics, average anomalies
and noise. as with approach, they are always a detour in this regard; they
counteract the information implosion of nominalism.

     6  wonder, innovation, contradictions
beginning with a sense of awe - everything signs everything, everything
inscribes. innovation in terms of heuristic projections and introjections
- contradictions in terms of anomalies, revisions, recuperations, returns.
wonder is a washing, determinate sublime, approach across the edge of the
cliff, reworking binding and boundary.

     7  deep ecologies, interstitial
the ecologies become perceptually deeper; gaps are filled in; one lives in
depth in the glades, aware of cyclical time, anomalous events, local
histories, individual plants and animals. think of messy thickets as
sheaves; partial separations tend towards partial separations. format
information formats, format information. the habitus tends towards
experience.

     8  filling in the habitus
from larger to smaller clues and cues - alligators and wading birds to
landbirds and invertebrates for example. as one moves down in scale,
identification becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible.

     9  from anomaly to behaviors
and back again; behavior clusters based on attributes. or from story to
structure, diachrony to synchrony, anecdote to prediction.

    10  sense of occupation and intimacy
inhabitation based on familiarity, familiality. what is occupation without
possession, the contract. intimacy forestalls occupation, the experiential
relegating definition. but in another sense, that of familiar territory,
'my work,' 'my walk,' 'my singing,' 'my song,' my process, my advance, my
report and distribution.

    11  familiarity, familiality
in the first, equivalence scripts and schemata, universals, typifications;
in the second, identity scripts and experientials, individuations. in
both, the failure of distributive aristotelian logics, in both the
gestured and extrapolated indefinite bandwidth. (22)

    12  maternality
chora and matrix - the inchoate beneath the surface of the subject, the
dominion of striations, vocalizations.

    13  deconstruction of the abject
disarticulation of the abject as such and rearticulation in terms of
microstructure, skein. the muck and clutter in relation to marl/peat moss
and biome or flora/fauna regimes. muck and clutter as regimes.

    14  phenomenology of naming
following the notion of rigid designators, beginning with classification,
classification experience, virtual subjectivity and its relation to
concrete manifestation.

    15  inarticulate inchoate
maternality: see above. the proffering of languaging or template. the
inert real. the unspeaking, unspeakable, unspoken.

    16  the mess and its overcoming
entanglement as regime intrusions, conflicting biomes, collapse or
implosion, niche-construction, problems of scale in space and time.
the mess overcoming.

    17  phenomenology of touch
demarcation of environment on the body - thicket tangle, poisonwood,
against the skin. differentiation of the mass. eidetic reduction to the
pressure of being.

    18  reinscription of domain
the domain _as_ continually inscribed in negotiation. linguistic contract
of the subject. increasingly fuzzy boundary issues. refinement of
differentiations - typology to decreasing tolerances.

    19  immersive and definable structures
definable is fully reversible; immersive is fuzzy, vectored. both are
capable of meta-level collocations, i.e. a definable of definable,
immersive of definable, etc.

    20  clue skeins
clues related theoretically, taxonomically, in terms of typifications,
taxonomies - heuristic skeins, established on the run. partial skeins,
tagged skeins, default tag skeins.

    21  the instrumental reason of flows and part-objects
fluid mechanics, turbulence, stases within the flow - non-equilibrium
thermodynamics. the partitioning, parcelling, clutter, of the world.
part-objects as modules: modules 'on the part of' the subject, and modules
'defined as such' within the continually reinscribed domain.

    22  gestural logics and superimpositions
such that partial information (as in land's experiments re: color vision)
extends across a total domain or spectrum.

    23  delaying conclusions and the settling-in of elements
inconclusivity of discourses which are increasingly refined. elements
noticed and defined 'settle in' - in the sense of familiarity - always
with default tags - i.e. elimination by counterexample. retention of _weak
theory_ - searching for coherency without retention of apparently outmoded
paradigms.

    24  continuous processing and absorption of anomalies
anomalies as generative of domain boundaries, entities, temporary
inscriptions, potential of part-objects, etc. the anomaly as the mis-fit
among the accountable and accounted-for. as unaccountable, uncounted, the
anomaly generates circumscriptions, circumlocutions; these are involved by
the subject in a consideration and absorption of the _detour._ every
anomaly potentially turns everything around, and is turned around by
everything.

    25  modes of approach in space and time
diachronic/synchronic approaches - space-time slices. diffusion of
occluded layerings (bay bottoms versus onshore mangrove island
topography). architectonics of the domain.

    26  horizons of 'natural' and 'unnatural' worlds
and horizons of 'subjective' and 'objective' worlds - in relation to
heuristics and experiential structures (immersivities). definition is both
tool and violation; mobile fuzzy domain boundaries participate in the
natural (i.e. given) order as well as ideological political/economic
conscious and unconscious considerations.

    27  weakening of perceptual structures and responses
approach is always already self-critical, self-critique; the critique
itself is withdrawn from the self, sublimated into emergent considerations
of the domain. the phenomenology of approach implies a weakness of
language, definition, inscription, boundary, instrumental reason; it
implies releasement, waiting (not waiting-upon) as well.

    28  releasement and listening
to listen without consideration of the source, the speech, one's answer;
to avoid pausological structures ('yes, but...'); to speak after (what
appears to be) the case.

    29  buildings, dwellings, and habitations
domains as fuzzy architectures, the build world, to the extent of the
delimitation. dwelling, as in residing within the domain, within the
subjective horizon of the experiential mode in relation to the domain. the
domain as inhabited by the subject, wor(l)ds becoming 'natural' in the
sense of familiarity, familiality.

    30  the neighborhood
it is the neighborhood, communality, the constitutes the increasing
approach of the domain. to the extent of a phenomenology of approach, the
domain is asymptotic, never fully approached. the neighborhood is a
confluence of neighborhoods, intersections demographics, zones and zoning
ordinances, ethnicities - just about any conceivable attribute, fuzzy or
not (for example, families whose surnames begin with 'Mc'). the neighbor-
hood is also a maternality, a comfort-zone, an occupation constituted by
the participant's introjections and projections. neighborhood is created
by their increasing coherency and stability, a homeostatic domain itself.
the attainment of homeostasis involves mechanisms for absorbing anomaly,
to the extent that anomaly becomes subsumed (i.e. this moth is an unknown
species within the imperial silk family).

    31  intersecting populations and worlds
no domain is pure, no approach can posit an isolated object for long.
skeins intermesh diachronically and synchronically, across disciplines and
other semi-rigid boundaries of the classical episteme. domains possess
symptomatic leakage and staining; there are stigma-zones, exhaustion
zones, depletion zones, zones of surplus accumulations. what is posited as
an object both diffuses and expands; becoming invisible, it participates
within neighborhooding, worlding - becoming visible, it participates in
skew-orthogonal skeining and the report.

    32  phenomenology of withdrawal
every approach is a withdrawal; what is known is known in recession. the
decrease of tolerance is asymptotic at best. the greater the knowledge,
the weaker the theory, heuristics coming more and more into play. there
are dialectics among reifications, objectifications, subjectivities,
reports and encapsulations, releases and experience, determinations and
faltering data, anomaly. the phenomenology of approach embeds withdrawal,
just as withdrawal implies approach. every introjection, a projection; and
every projection, an introjection.

    33  the skein (skew-orthogonal)
the grid and its imposition, input-output matrices, markov chains, tensors
and absorptions of data, local geodesics, fuzzy or clouded enumerations,
collocations of data.

    34  the skein (askew and local)
the local scribble, local geodesics without embedding, fluid-mechanical or
cellular automata modeling, closures, accumulations of data, local messes.

    35  increasing audacity and circumscription
one takes increasing chances as danger apparently recedes by virtue of
knowledge. how to approach a snake or alligator; how to ward off deerflies
and no-see-ums. an approach is always a detour (thus the sides, top and
bottom, are in evidence); the domain, no matter how problematic, is both
skein-connected (to its environs, history, etc., without and with
observation, to taxonomic schema, ideologies, cultures and civilizations,
and so forth) - and disconnected (to the extent that it is not 'its'
intention that one approaches, that one makes the approach, that it is
within one's horizon - but who knows). a detour may follow one or another
walk-around, or it maybe be a confluence/manifold of the totality of
walk-arounds - for example, the semi-totalities of gathering periphyton
data in space time through selected sites, extrapolated across the glades
in their entirety.

    36  the report
for example: the everglades as we know them are younger than writing; this
residue is older than that. the report is tailored to distribution modes,
economics, audience, historiographies, symbolic conventions, bibliography
and reference, dedication and authority, placement within or without
various series, a particular written language, attendant taxonomic ploys,
languages, and paradigms.

    37  the distribution
the distribution of the report enters the field of reports, processes of
reporting and distributing, checks and counter-checks. the report is
always already a reification by virtue of peer and other consensus; this
is the escape or leakage of the phenomenology of approach into profession,
professionalism, and doxa.

    38  the thinking of it
and the rethinking of it, the arc through and across the report, response,
distributions, counter-distributions, argument and counter-argument, the
return to the field, the walking-through the field, and always already
transformation of the domain and its problematic.

    39  the world of it
the world is all that is the case. but the world and worlding are
dissimilar and 'the' already breaks down among virtual and real, virtual
particles and introjections/projections, phantasms and implicate orders.
nothing remains of encompassment; domains dissolve or problematize, just
as the 'of it' - already a possessive - is another releasement.

    40  the knowledge, experiencing of the knowledge
what recedes, becoming, not knowledge, but implicate, implicated, tacit.
my boundaries, body, disappear, absent themselves, among the thickets.
worlding wheels on virtual axes; id and ego merge mute. what was real and
had become symbolic now recedes into the imaginary and real. skin and
masquerade become one; abjection diffuses among bodies, waters, earths,
islands, hammocks. enunciation is always a problem increasingly distant as
one silences, the report long gone, having been written, distributed,
critiqued, absorbed, discarded. those series or skeins have no place here;
evanescent, they're already exhausted by consciousness and defuge. the
leaving that is left is an accompaniment, future inhabitation of memory or
visitation, minding, mindful. no longer the distance of the approach or
proximity of withdrawal, but only translucency, transparency on rare
occasion. imagining the glades, but not without myself diffused, laminar,
here and there, the skitter.

One falls into it: the text, the river, the Everglades, the alligator-maw.
It's productive, a kind of tacit/muscular intelligence at work, an
approach silencing language, in the guise of increasing (incipient)
structure. Gaining knowledge, gaining footholds, listening.

No one speaking but myself, enunciated, as if from/of the park (as if/from

introjection/projection.

Scales have neither beginning nor ending, pointsets and bandwidth; one
begins somewhere, after all. But the beginning is always occluded - always
this differance as you say, a deferring, not to the sign, but to its
absence - an absence spelled out only in the metapsychology of the
subject. ...

>From ryan.whyte@UTORONTO.CA Sat May 11 22:31:23 2002

-Is it reductive to say that some of the texts you've produced operate
-across these kinds of formal structures, in which reading 'for plot'
-operates across this reading of the map of topographical/topological
-shifts, as it were? The metaphor strains, but it leads to an interesting
-situation of reading, in which 'formal' difficulties in reading apply
-pressure to a kind of tacit knowledge, "silencing language" -- arguably
-the situation of every reading, but 'more so' in this case; riskier --
-...

One might have a narratology without a reading, I think; the phenomenology
of approach implies the former to the extent that there is a noticing,
tending towards the intention to investigate, or at least approach - to
reorient the mind and body towards (  ) - no matter how suffused (  ) is
or appears to be. Even walking or a walk-around is a narration.

One might consider an inordinately rough terrain - and then what happens?
One's attention is consumed with keeping one's balance - almost nothing
else is occurring, and any other goals or destinations - the teleology
itself - may be put on hold, subsumed, reduced to a (default) tag in the
subject's fuzzy scheme of things...

-Agreed -- but I wonder also if the psychoanalytic models -- projection
-etc --- might also be too reductive of what one might call the ecology of
-ideas, both in your texts and in the reading of them? As if the site were
-not that of fantasy or the ego but something that radically takes apart
-the ego, but 'speaks' nonetheless....

I don't think of the site 'taking apart' or 'speaking' - no such book of
nature, etc. It's inert, real. Projection can be a diffusion or emission;
certainly what's occurring in the phenomenology of approach is occurring
within the subject, within the horizon of the subject - elsewhere, extern-
ally, there's instrumental reason, etc. So I'm thinking of a broader meta-
psychology, one of flows/flux/spew/emission as well (my notion of 'defuge'
is related to this). As far as 'taking apart,' it's not as if the ego were
assembled. In almost everything one does, it's absent (see Drew Leder); in
a sense, neither it (nor id) nor the body are present -

[scales]

-And here the psychoanalytic -- at least the Lacanian -- is compelling --
-what is being addressed, what is addressing the subject in or in relation
-to the site (these sentences are difficult to write -- qualification on
-qualification)? The place itself fluctuates with stains, the screen....
[...]

Again, is the subject ever addressed? In the addressing of the subject,
surely it's always the subject that's addressing, at least in the receiv-
ing, if nothing else? A dead subject can never be addressed, at least in
terms of interiority and horizon. The receptor is address.

I wrote a while ago about 'sm's - using sado-masochisms as a crude model
for couplings and linkages, out of which worlding occurs. One might think
of couplings and linkages in terms of the phenomenology of approach and
the skein, embedding, distancing, etc. But that would be another text...

jennifer's dream of goodness

lacewings curled around each other in the doomed thicket.
they came to me and said, there is no competition; cut the cables.
the unseemly monotony of engines formed a distant phalanx.
already live-born young were the order of the day.
eggstrands transformed into protective grills.
poison occupied the tips of incessant life.
the contribution of the viruses was immense and not to be underestimated.
a second-order phalanx formed inside the mutated grills.
microscopic domains organized against the violence of the macro-world.
lacewing circulations, viral turbulence, across the sawgrass surface.
their stems bending slightly, sawgrass forests acquiesced to the power
of the thicket.
shudders went through skins of the mammalian order.
their live-born young died quickly of unknown contusions.
the phalanxes stilled among incessant life.
lacewings curled around each other in the order of the day.

the glades are a continuous dynamic process across a planar surface. a

and human intervention. the dynamic is everything; think of the glades as
an _inscribed surface_ transforming in space and time - a surface organic
and shifting. the glades are simultaneous with their entanglement of life
and migration; they are vectored, and vector is everything.

geology is underfoot; to manage the glades is to manage the ecosystem.

You don't support your case by arguing it through a
line of poetry written by a Harvard-educated poet.



At the most elementary level, merely to know how to
write requires the basic education of alphabet, etc.
To write with a less limited vocabulary and to know
how to employ what correct spelling or grammar are, a
little more education.  The very ideal that such a
thing as poetry exists, versus only transcribed speech
or prose, takes the education of being introduced to a
poem (increasingly rare, in the over-all poetry-less
American culture): schools themselves are usually the
only place where that happens.  That poetry can be
more than one particular stamp of style (metered,
rhyme) grows out of exposure to more and more
varieties of authors, historical periods: eduction (or
self-education).  And, for right or wrong, right now,
whether it's an insiders' network recognizing the cues
of their own compatriots, in terms of book prizes,
writers' colonies and other institutionalized measures
of a poet's advancement or status, there is a
statistically disproportionate number of MFAs, that
is, education beyond even the B.A. college level.
With academic critics, similarly.

A better-educated poet is a better poet (a
better-educated ~person~ is in a better position to
write).


The topic that I was responding to, Andrew Rathmann's
anti-literacy "rant" that poets should not read
academic criticism, was focussing on one particular
stripe of thinking, that of academic criticism:
critique, critical/analytical thinking, theory
(intertextuality, interrelation of parts to whole,
testing poetry against the filter of canonical
thinkers/philosophers [the condemned Adorno]...).

Broadening (blurring) the topic to include
contemplation ("How about thinking with the body, with
the soul; through meditation") or late phases of
~character~ ("through experience. Wherefore wisdom?"),
or other types of thought, such as daydreaming,
fantasy, visionary hallucination, dyslexia, etc., is
catholic of you, a sort of fundamentalism, but that
departs from the original question of whether poets
should insulate ourselves unread and blindered.
I was addressing only that, and not every periphery of
the mind and human condition.


> Your logic reduces thought to what can be had
through education, and that, for me, is borderline
crazytalk. <

The List will function more civilly if we keep what we
say to each other a little more Christian.

You know what you remind me of?
Those people who tell me I should have a tv show,
which wouldn't have the effect of a put-down
were they able to "hook me up" as it were,
were they not poets who deride others, who tend
to be more entertaining as "narcissistic"
or "funny" etc...

I don't feel strongly about it....


>>>C---Well, gender's always been your blindspot.
Listen, if you feel so strongly about it, why don't
YOU pose nude....
Chris

>>>>C.
But, in the first place, didn't you tell me once that
now that Ginsberg and Corso, etc., are dead,
that you really miss how their sheer taken-for-granted
presence helped keep the poetry world "honest,"
that maybe you were premature in your conclusion
that you "outgrew" them, or at least that something
like, if not exactly, the way they made themselves
"a motley to the view," regardless of the merits of
the bulk of their work, may be needed especially
since the more sophisticated page-based poet's poets
seem more and more boring, deadeing, without some kind of
'outside' foil? And I don't really see what this has to
do with being straight and not gay, or even what
it has to do with being male and not female...

C



>>>>>Coppelia--
No, you're not being too hard on me. It's just that
Ginsberg, if not O'Hara, came to really BORE me
with his "bare, forked creature" or whatever King Lear says
about it. And besides, it's one thing for a gay male to
present himself a naked body in the 1950s and quite
another for a straight male in 1999....
C



>>>>>>Chris---Okay, sorry, sorry, it won't happen again.
I know about "intellectual property" and "attitude"
and "reputation" and all that too....but I still think
you're being too hard on yourself (but you already
know that; in fact, pride yourself on it--what a waste).
So they didn't call your (buff) bluff--so what?
It reflects more on them than on you---I mean,
come on, the fact they hold up (still I think)
both Ginsberg and O'Hara as two of their
founding "spirits" or heroes or whatever,
both of whom were into posing nude, and
neither of whom had especially "attractive" bodies
(so it's not about aesthetics really, in more ways
than one!), and that they would not publish
that photo of you, well, it reflects badly on them!
Aren't you just falling back into the same kind
of shame-based hypocrisy at your occasional best
you so often deride in others? Or am *I* now
being "too hard on you" by saying you're being
too hard on yourself?
Coppelia


>>>>>>>C-
Yes, but they opted for a face shot!
Rejected even there! And turns out they were right,
I just did it out of some "dark soul of the night"
kind of desperation. Hadn't "had any" in a long while,
narcissism begetting alienation begetting narcissism, etc.
Absolutely self indulgent, and not only that,
vulgar, played, cliche....It's embarrassing...

I don't see what your problem is; after all YOU
were the one who sent it...Don't worry about it....

This is the thing: that was why I said something like  "Israel Nazis"  -
maybe not cricket, but I see some parallels between the Israeli Right and
the Nazis -especially the extremists - some of whom belive they are "the
chosen peole" as the Nazis did and also the Afrikaaners: and for years we
have been fed with sentimental crap about how the Isaraelis "made thedesert
bloom" by Uris et al when in reality the Israelis used fascist (neo- Nazi)
tactics to force the Palestinians from their own homelands. Then for years
they have mistraeted the Palestinians...they take the best land, use the
Palestinians as cheap labour, attck without warning the Arabs, carry out
endless preemptive strikes. They are backed by the US and other Western
powers. The US meantime shit stirs in other parts of the middle East
region - backing this, backing that, destablising regimes (as they did in
Vietnam and Korea and Central and South America) , the Russians are also in
the act: now not all Israelis agree to this, nor all Jews. being  a Jew
doesnt mean that you are politically blind like Herr Brink.
  Then the Palestians (bravely ) carry out  many terrorist (read commando:
guerilla; freedom fighter) acts and the Right wing and the Israeli Military
ignore this and the world is fed with crap about how marvelous Israel is,
how terrible the Palestinians are, and no progress is made. So it reaches a
stage where it is now near impossible to stop the violence.
  The politicians act like insane men: but not all Jews necessarily support
Zionism -  or at least the actions of the Isareali military - and there many
Palestinians who want to negotiate a reasonalbe distribution: a just
settlement.
  Until negotiations begin the suicide bombers remain heroes to me: fighting
as they can who are against a wall as the Jews were in Warsaw. Richard.

Dear List Members--The Ear Inn Reading Series has a new Web site at

http://home.nyc.rr.com/earinnreadings/

If anyone has historical background information about readings at the Ear
Inn--and I know some of you do--please backchannel me with this information
at mbroder@nyc.rr.com or earinnpoetry@nyc.rr.com.

There is an About page on the site that mentions the previous tenure of the
language poets and includes a link the the Live at the Ear CD Web site.
However, I know there is much more to tell.  Any information would be
greatly appreciated and gratefully acknowledged.

Please note, the site is definitely a work in progress--my first venture
into HTML.  I eagerly await the day I read the chapter on how to create
multiple frames so I can add a navigational bar.  In the meantime, apologies
for the clunkiness.  It's a start.

Yours,
Michael

I can't find my old xerox copy, but I believe that it's in the Objectivist
Anthology, where he prints "A" 1-6 in early versions. The Objectivist issue
of Poetry has "A"-7 in it.

I'm afraid I cannot see them as heroes, Richard
I have a lot of trouble with what they are doing
but what they are doing is no worse, much less worse, than what is being
done by the Israeli side - it is as you describe it,I believe; and it seems
to me that all official Israeli  utterances are in bad faith
Furthermore, on the Palestinian side, there is an argument to be made for
self-defence, a response to invasion and aggression. I cannot see the
argument of self-defence for the Israelis
We are all better off without heroes of any kind
It is good to hear someone put a dissenting view so clearly

Filmakers Library is now distributing

SOMETHING WONDERFUL MAY HAPPEN:
New York School of Poets and Beyond
a film by Lars Movin, Niels Plenge and Thomas Thurah

Three Danish film makers produced this one-hour film for an American poetry festival held this summer in Copenhagen. A description of the film is at

And ordering information can be found via the home page --

The interviews with, and readings by, Ashbery and Koch are excellent and the footage of O'Hara (from the NET out takes) is beautifully integrated into the film, so that O'Hara becomes the ghostly center of it all.

Jeffrey:  I don't remember anyone on this thread arguing in favor of
illiteracy. But to conflate the education of a poet with a knowledge of big
words and education with advanced university degrees is a bit strange. The
very educated Ben Jonson, who had a couple of the latter, said of his
friend Shakespeare that he had "little latin and less greek," but I don't
think he thought him uneducated in other ways.

30 years ago, more or less, my late friend the poet and novelist Richard
Elman wrote a recommendation for me for the MacDowell Colony. He described
me as being "as a poet largely self-taught." I said that wasn't true--while
I had avoided workshops and the like I had gone to graduate school in
literature, but more importantly I had learned from a great many other
poets. "I know," he said, "but they look for MFAs. If I paint you as a
primitive you'll  get in." I was shocked--some of the poets I knew taught,
as Richard did then, in MFA programs, but none of them, not Richard, or
Armand Schwerner, or Chuck Stein, or Gerrit Lansing--need I go on?--had
MFAs. They were, in fact, pretty rare among poets my age and older, at
least in New York. In the course of one generation that changed.

"A better-educated poet is a better poet (a better-educated ~person~ is in
a better position to write)." The context of your statement makes it clear
that by education you mean formal education, and it would seem to follow
that those with doctorates are better poets than those with MFAs, etc. But
to stick with MFAs, because that's the level at which you appeal to
statistics, do you think that the less-educated poets of very recent
generations, like Ashbery, who doesn't have an MFA, or O'Hara, or Ginsberg,
or Blackburn, or Schwerner, or Rochelle Owens (no undergraduate degree,
either), or Creeley, or Duncan, or Olson, etc., are somehow lacking as
poets (and less educated as poets) because they didn't get MFAs?

Or maybe the difference is that the MFA has become an institutional
qualification that helps people get into art colonies. Maybe the very few
good poets, some of whom have MFAs, would have become good poets and
acquired whatever education they needed whether or not they also acquired MFAs.

You are aware that neither MFAs nor academic programs devoted to teaching
writers how to write exist in most countries. Yet poets learned in their
craft appear with regularity in all sorts of places.

Not only formal education, but an education in MFA. Does that mean that a
person with a doctorate in philosophy or political science or science in
general or whatever (outside literature/writing work shops) can not write
poetry? Stated this way, the idea to me seems ridiculous.

Jeffrey,

I'm glad you returned to Andrew's post, which as Mark pointed out does not
advocate anything like illiteracy. In fact, Andrew is cautious not to
generalize:

>This does not mean that all academic criticism is
>bad, just that there are distorting forces at work.

His main complaint is not against criticism per se, but against the effect
of the academic system upon its own forms of discourse:

>The annoying outcome is that those who really
>succeed within the system know only the professionally
>approved ways of talking about literature.

Your response equivocated on "academic criticism", adding to it not only
education but the very act of thinking (hence also conflating thinking and
education):

>A better-educated poet is a better poet (a
>better-educated ~person~ is in a better position to
>write).  One of the artificial boundaries that Andrew
>Rathmann's anti-criticism rant sets up is a wall
>between poetry and thinking.  To the contrary, as
>ideas are, in the final wash, very much a part of
>poetry

This takes us a distance from Andrew's "rant," doesn't it?

Responding more to your post than to Andrew's, I confused the discussion by
bringing up wholistic ideas of what it means to "think"-- I didn't need to
go that far. It would have been enough to point out that one need not read
academic criticism to be a poet. One need not even go to school.  Of course,
facility with language is necessary, and it helps to be able to write down
your own words.

I think of the Kalevala.  Or a poem like "Donal Og" -- amazing, yet clearly
uneducated. Or rap lyrics, which contantly remind me that language is
everybody's, and so is its art.  These things in mind, I allow Andrew his
rant against 'academic criticism' and its purveyors, his claim that "poets
should not seek their approval."  He's not creating a "wall between poetry
and thinking"; he's claiming a territory for poetry larger than the
university.

Jeffrey, I should not have used the word "crazytalk" to characterize the
position that equates thinking with education (or poetry-writing with
schooling). I certainly didn't mean to imply that *you* are crazy. I hold
you and your writing in deserved esteem,

Happy mother's day,
-Aaron



DONAL OG
Anonymous
from the Irish by Lady Gregory

It is late last night the dog was speaking of you;
the snipe was speaking of you in her deep marsh.
It is you are the lonely bird through the woods;
and that you may be without a mate until you find me.

Your promised me, and you said a lie to me,
that you would be before me where the sheep are flocked;
I gave a whistle and three hundred cries to you,
and I found nothing there but a bleating lamb.

You promised me a thing that was hard for you,
a ship of gold under a silver mast;
twelve towns with a market in all of them,
and a fine white court by the side of the sea.

Your promised me a thing that is not possible,
that you would give me gloves of the skin of a fish;
that you would give me shoes of the skin of a bird;
and a suit of the dearest silk in Ireland.

When I go by myself to the Well of Loneliness,
I sit down and I go through my trouble;
when I see the world and do not see my boy,
he that has an amber shade in his hair.

It was on that Sunday I gave my love to you;
the Sunday that is last before Easter Sunday.
And myself on my knees reading the Passion;
and my two eyes giving love to you for ever.

My mother said to me not to be talking with you today,
or tomorrow, or on the Sunday;
it was a bad time she took for telling me that;
it was shutting the door after the house was robbed.

My heart is as black as the blackness of the sloe,
or as the black coal that is on the smith's forge;
or as the sole of a shoe left in white halls;
it was you put that darkness over my life.

You have taken the east from me; you have taken the west from me;
you have taken what is before me and what is behind me;
you have taken the moon, you have taken the sun from me;
and my fear is great that you have taken God from me!

Again, an appeal to such educated anecdotes as any
about Ben Jonson undermine your direction toward some
sort of Noble Savage poet, by betraying yourself as
already educated in the variety that you will not
defend.

(It was said about Madame Melville, too, that she
either hath or hath not Greek.  But, at a remove of
one hundred years with her, or shrouded in the even
greater greater obscurity of a half millenium and
whether there even ~was~ a single author Shakespeare,
it's difficult-to-impossible to leap-frog backwards
from our historical specifics to those then, which,
very likely, were really statements about ~class~
rather than intelligence or education. [...Although
the two often went hand in hand.])


I was trying to limit the scope of misinterpretation
by re-looping the thread to its original purl:

I was not equating thinking with education (although I
believe that thinking generally is sharpened by the
honing of education, and that thinking must be thought
~through~ models and ideas and precedents, so that the
more "introjects," as it were, that thinking has, the
more it has to think ~with~ and ~about,~ ... like
cuisine [more ingredients] emerging out of cooking).
That is a misreading.

And I most certainly am not a believer in MFAs.  Far,
far from it.  The moment in my post where my sincere
opinion peeped a cameo through the ironies was in
saying "for right or wrong, right now, whether it's an
insiders' network recognizing the cues of their own
compatriots".  In other words: for right or wrong?
Sign me up for: wrong.  I am prone to agree with you
that "the MFA has become an institutional
qualification that helps people get into art
colonies",--- although not solely at the level of the
resume', but (hermeneutic of suspicion) as with book
prizes, MFAs are incorporating into their poetry
"codes" (structures) as easily demarcated as the
"codes" of academic criticism that were earlier
referred to, so that this is the self-perpetuating
juggernaut of a class preferring its own class, and
the momentum or intertia continues because poetry with
the markers of MFA-ism is being rewarded by MFA-ist
poets.  (There was, incidentally, a decent article in
The Village Voice last week about the bad hegemony of
MFAs: my server is to slow right now to get the URL.)

The original point that I have been ~exclusively~
reacting to was the assertion that poets should not
read academic criticism.

That is, that poets should blinder themselves.  That
is, that there is something that poets should not
read, ---just as good Bible Belt Christians shouldn't
read ungodly books.  That is, that there should be a
limit and a ceiling placed on literacy
(anti-literacy): we can progress from the eigth grade
to "some college," but not from "some college" further
in the rainbow of what we read.

I don't think that's good advice or a good attitude.

I think poets should read ~everything~ they can get
their hands on, especially if it has to do with the
unfamiliar, the legitimately obsure, and the difficult
(like academic criticism).  Time to put aside the milk
and sink teeth into the meat:

http://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/Hbr/Hbr005.html#12
.

This feud between a myth of Muse-inspired spontaneous
inspirational ignoramus poetry versus the broader
responsibilities and points of origin that academic
criticism (highfalutin' effete intellectual egghead
stuff) gauges poetry against--- it keeps playing
itself out, generationally: William Carlos Williams
versus T.S. Eliot, the Beats versus the New York
School, the second generation New York School
(Berrigan) versus the first,--- and yet, underneath
the sort of Marx Bros. comedy of characters running
around all whooped up bopping each other on the heads
with featherdusters and salamis, Berrigan's formal
education was as Ivy League as Kenneth Koch's, and
Williams returned, in ~Paterson,~ etc., to a
scholasticism that required footnotes even more
repleat than Eliot's.

As, for example, ironically, this disagreement (among
clones) is being conducted via a vehicle of the State
University of Buffalo's.

If there's such a justifiable and unanimous antipathy
toward the academic, then why (this hair-splitting)
aren't we spending our time with
http://www.gigglepoetry.com or
http://www.poetry4kids.com , instead?

The effect of my statement (I would never have
included it in the first place if I could have
foreseen the consequences: the real points that I made
were in the rest of the post, about the conveyor belt
of productivity, and roles versus species.  The
contested remarks was a poorly phrased passing aside
only incidental to the rest) seems to be resonating
against sore personal history and wounds that are
unrelated to the broad sketchiness of the statement
itself: I'm sorry that anyone should be given a
qualified letter of recommendation to a writer's
colony and that the trauma of that would stay with him
forever,--- but, frankly, I don't think the MacDowell
Colony a particularly healthy phenomenon either.
That's more of this ethos of poet as pseudo-~leisure
class,~

http://www.macdowellcolony.org/images/macdowell.jpg

where we have to be off in literally 450 acres of
patrician countryside having meals served to us, and
where one out of three meals is hand-delivered so the
undisturbed wordsmith shouldn't lose the scent of moly
that wafts from his nosegay, ...as though eclogues and
idylls between Bion and Moschus were in vogue.  I did
not mean to excite some sort of traumatic flashback to
that A- on anybody's transcript.

I'm only saying that, unless we're back to Savanarola
and book-burning, yes, poets should read academic
criticism.

If our poetry itself is so ~fantastically
obscurantist~ and polysemic that nobody can make heads
or tails of it, ~what difference~ does it make if you
don't understand some of the academic jargon ("code")?
 In comparison to Language Poetry, it's like a grade
school primer in its comprehensibility.

~Without~ academic criticism, there is no safeguard of
quasi-rationality over the fate of poetry, and it's
then that its outcomes and superstars and who's in
print, etc., is decided entirely by the brutishness of
unchecked power and croneyism.

Battus and Corydon, two rustic fellows, meeting in a
glade, gossip about their neighbour, Aegon, who has
gone to try his fortune at the Olympic games.  After
some random banter, the talk turns on the death of
Amaryllis, and the grief of Battus is disturbed by the
roaming of his cattle.  Corydon removes a thorn that
has run into his friend's foot, and the conversation
comes back to matters of rural scandal.

The scene is in Southern Italy.

Battus:  Tell me, Corydon, whose kine are these, - the
cattle of Philondas?

Corydon:  Nay, they are Aegon's, he gave me them to
pasture.

Battus:  Dost thou ever find a way to milk them all,
on the sly, just before evening?

Corydon:  No chance of that, for the old man puts the
calves beneath their dams, and keeps watch on me.

Battus:  But the neatherd himself, - to what land has
he passed out of sight?

Corydon:  Hast thou not heard?  Milon went and carried
him off to the Alpheus.

Battus:  And when, pray, did he ever set eyes on the
wrestlers' oil?

If this assertion is the cause of your reactions, Jeffrey, I would like to
see where it was made.  And who expanded it into "a justifiable and
unanimous antipathy toward the academic" -- (if not you yourself) ?

Cheers,
Aaron

anticipation of everglades, countries, dry-dusts and radiations - they
are a continuous dynamic process across a planar surface. a crayfish,
aware of cyclical time, anomalous events, local everglades underfoot - to
extensivity extrusions - familiality for example: the fall into it. the
glades are simultaneous with their entanglement of life by souvenirs from
horizon interwoven and may be limited in everglades as in one text - the
hydrology, ecosystem. for example (below): everglades younger than data in
imagining the glades, but not without myself diffused, laminar, the glades
in limestone solution holes. refuge in everglades is a dynamic confluence
intervention. the dynamic is everything; think of the glade as we're born.
manage the glades is to manage the ecosystem. glades, as one of the newer
rangers described everglades visitors as down 30% since the refuge-sememe,
rivers, everglades, and alligator-maw. and human the glades. they are
space and/or time. example: an everglades bounding occasion, shifting. and
the everglades - "i gave my blood in the everglades" - one space-time
through selected sites, extrapolated across the glades deep in subjective
youth more than writing; this geology is experiential, ex-tasis of glade.

Note in advance that by the rules this will be my last post for the day,
and anyway I'm in the nidst of trying to unravel for gringo readers the
circumstances of poetry in Baja California.

I'm sorry you feel the need to defend what I assume is your chosen
profession; I don't know that anyone was attacking it. I'll restrict myself
to a couple of comments.  I wish I could help you with your confusion, but
I guess you'll have to resolve your conflicts about the academic enterprise
on your own.

I don't think I've undercut an argument I wasn't making (being a straw man
makes me itch all over--damned allergies!) Who said anything about noble
savages or the muse? There's more than one way to get an education, and
more than one kind, even within the academic world. And your remarks about
MFAs indicate that you and I are in some agreement at least on that score.

I read Jonson's Timbres, where he goes on about Shakespeare, on my own when
I was about 12, by the way--god knows how I stumbled upon it, but one can
only be grateful. It certainly wasn't assigned by Traphagen Junior High
(nor, for that matter, by Columbia or Johns Hopkins).

As to my "trauma," I'd be careful at least about the accuracy of ad homina,
if I were you.  I have no idea if Richard was right . I did get
into  MacDowell, which I can tell you was a lifesaver for me as a
writer--if  only as a free vacation (the only kind I could afford) from
full time and overflowing work as a psychiatric social worker and parent (I
came home to one sore significant other, let me tell you). Those who don't
get three months off a year love these places when they get to go there,
altho a great many of my co-colonists were the beneficiaries of such cushy
(relative to social work and a great many other ways to make a living)
jobs. I subsequently got into VCCA, the Rhode Island Colony (now
defunct),  Ragdale, and Yaddo, and in each case pent-up words flooded out
of me.  Haven't applied in years, but I work for myself now, and the
considerable constraints on my time are self-imposed (alas! would that I
could go on strike!).  Those places are great perks, and we all know that
there are precious few for most writers.

You'd think, as an ex-therapist and graduate of a prestigeous training
institute, that my traumatized state would not have escaped my attention.
But I guess denial is a powerful river.

I do agree with you that poets should aspire to read everything. I'm not
sure that the inevitable failure to do so leads to the dire consequences
you propose. Surely failure to read academic criticism doesn't banish us to
giggle poetry?

Not that the ideas in academic criticism are that complex, although the
language sometimes is. I've decoded a few texts in my time, but I must say
that one can learn a lot more quickly from informed chitchat.

I read a lot of poetry from very early on, and I was signally lucky in
being guided extra-academically into new paths by informed friends (Chuck
Stein got me reading Black Mountain and its sequellae, Gerrit Lansing
insisted I read O'Hara's Odes). I learned a lot of what I know about rhythm
and line breaks from a lifelong interest (again, extra-academic) in
classical music and a long-lost career in film, in which I excelled at
editing. Because I tend to think and talk I've  thought and talked about
these things with a fair number of people, and my students, when they're
lucky enough to get me, hear a lot about these things. And I won't deny
that I've learned a few things in classes. Armand Schwerner, who read
unsystematically in a lot of fields, called a poet's education an
"accidental curriculum," and I think that's apt. He, too, read some
academic criticism, but he tended to spend more time with ancient  buddhist
and babylonian texts. Who knows? Maybe he would have been an even better
poet if he'd read more de Man (the demigod of the time).

Armand had an MA in anthropolgy, if memory serves, and no PfD, by the way.
He must have lived in perpetual darkness.

Who?  Where?  LangPo, wha | zat?

Huh ... ?<<<<<<

Given that Robin doesn't know what "LangPo" is, let alone who Anne Waldman
is, needless to say where downtown New York is, I don't see the point in
responding to what then amounts to a vague and insipid petulance in his last
email.

Unless Robin can answer to where he is coming from (I mean literary-wise),
and who he is speaking for (he seems to speak for more than himself),
there's just no point in addressing him directly.


2. Three Glosses

a. A Palgrave's *In Our Hands*

The Palgrave's antho. precisely isn't the Norton; it's not a specious
choice. Norton is taught in universities. Palgrave's is a sentimental
keepsake antho in households with only that as a volume of poetry, and sells
as popular literature. My Grandad, who was born in the Karou desert, had one
continually at his bedside table. Pound recounts a funny anecdote about
Palgrave's in How to Read (1929).

Maybe I should have said that LP has become a Palgrave's *in our hands*, to
be clearer, and in order to link it to the question of poetry and
"education" that is spinning out from and dwarfing Andrew's initial email,
with exccellent bellows-work from Jullich. And by "our hands" I mean this
list. I'm thinking especially of the recent fun poetry pilot that did a run
here, an episode now serializing at Millie's
http://www.sporkworld.org/PN/pn_71/html/index.php. This website I would say
is a *great* example of bildungspoesis at work -- going in as sporkworld,
and maybe out inside of poetry-world? That transformation, from sporkworld
to poetryworld, is one that I continually aspire to in my reading as well.

A poet should learn more than a Palgrave's worth of poetries. Norton's one
way to go. Actual whole books of poetry, etc., not just anthologies, is the
best way, blah blah blah.

b. Joel et al, I do think that the social, collective history of Langpo is
yet to be written, a theoretically savvy history locating the poetry inside
of a "community" (permit me this shorthand for now) address to social
concerns of audience, reception, history, theory, mass media, group, etc. So
that in fact I see your interest in the slam poetry scene -- because of its
links to a specific community address -- as being symptomatic of, and even
resulting from, the entire reception, to date, of Langpo, which has been a
reception that has continually downplayed those social links in the poetry.
I am *by no means* "faulting" the excellent critical reception,
specifically, to date of Langpo, only to point out there's a lot of critical
work yet to do that would have a hugely positive impact on the current
scenes. An d by critical receptioni here I do not mean the critical work by
Langpoets themselves. In fact Watten in particular has pointed in a salutary
way to the need for such a history.

c. I don't think this list reflects a Robert Ardry-like "territorial
imperative" or "naked ape" psychogenesis and development. That's taking a
popular (and also outdated) anthropology and applying it to the status quo.
That's like tuning in to CNN for its media critiques -- in the service of
"reporter's conscience."

1. Should Chris Stroffolino Buy A Car? Any Bride's Identificatory Dilemma?

a. Chris, your essay on Watten's "Bride of the Assembly Line" is more
nuanced than I let on in my email ("Re: Hail P longataki?" Sat, 4 May 2002
23:27:04 –0600), of course. But then, my reading of your identification with
Watten's essay via the question of whether he is recommending that you buy a
car, has itself become more nuanced.

b. The following reading of your reading of Watten's essay I would call one
that is inscribed within the idea of Language Poetry.

bb. We've heard / read of the expressions "so-called LP" and "so-called
'so-called LP'," etc. All these are for me readings taking place within the
idea of Language Poetry. I am deliberately using a crude seeming-idealist
language for now, "idea" (can it get any obviouser??), to refer to a complex
set of discursive domains and histories, some intersecting, some not, across
a variety of institutions and group practices, all of which refer in some
way to LP. A citational matrix, let’s say. As a term, "idea" may sound
monolithic, but the way I'm using it isn't meant to be. It has been a
*rhetorically* convenient term for me to use in the heat of exchanges on
this listserv and on another, but obviously within a methodology it would
need some more rigorous attention paid to it than I have so far. (If anyone
can help me, or relate it to other critical vocabularies, I'd be grateful.)

c. So (for the more nuanced reading), one could imagine, Chris, that you are
allegorically re-enacting, in your should-I-buy-a-car response to Watten's
essay, that historical moment of "first attachment" to a consumer model of
identification. A class reading of your identification would figure the poet
in his essay-review of Watten as re-enacting that prolonged 20C transition
wherein what's left of the collective working class especially after WWI
gets divided up and invited to buy into burgeoning consumerism and the
nation-state (in exchange for a little more cash in the pocket just short of
being completely inadequate to reproduce labor and to cause uncompromising
class struggle to continue).

d. A *critical and utopic* reconstruction of that historical moment would
consciously re-enact it as a *choice*, namely: do I/we collectively attach,
or not, to the consumerist model of identification?

e. In what you actually write, you waver between two conflicting
identifications, *neither of which you (can) make*. Either Watten is
recommending (identification #1) that you think of poetry as assembly-line
work in what has (in BW's & in others’ historical readings) become a factory
of language (hence, from your expressivist-romanticist viewpoint, you are
perplexingly being asked to "identify with reification" -- a tough social
command to imagine, let alone fulfill!), or (identification #2), that you
buy a car (today!), in other words (following the analogy back
historically), wait for the product to shoot out the factory doors before
"identifying" with both it and capitalism (this time not as underpaid
factory worker, but as a fully-enfranchised, shall we say, consumer). The
first identification (poet in the factory of language) -- the one that
Watten recommends for himself and for This magazine / early Coolidge -- is a
critically utopic / dystopic identification that comes closest to
theoretically restaging that moment of "first attachment" to the
now-prevalent consumerist model of identification. It comes closest because
what it restages is worker anxiety over reification, alienation, etc, in
other words those initiating conditions of labor which ideally begin the
consciousness-raising process toward a grasp of the concept of
commodification, etc. The second identification (buy car now!) is the one
you would like to favor, which, as the point of identification for you as a
poet, in the historical analogy of Watten's essay, actually invokes a later
time, post WWII at least, when cars were more affordable. I.e. your point of
identification is further along in the history of consumerism, as that
history is spelled out in terms of the Ford assembly line model of
production. This is reflected in your poetics influences (a bit of Beat, a
bit of NYSchool), which I'll allude to again at g, below).

f. The big identificatory question for any bride, then, in this restaging of
that historical moment of "first attachment" to a consumer model of
identification, is: Are you a revolutionary prole who sees the assembly line
and language for "what it really is" ("semiotic rubble" [BW on Andrews] etc)
or are you an aspirant to middle class consumerism and desire? Such is the
dilemma that Watten's essay should (and almost does) pose for "you."

g. Imagining poetry / language as a collective assembly-line is something
that you can't do (as I've already said) given your romanticist-expressivist
poetics bent, while as a poorly-funded sessional / student at the time of
writing your review, you can't buy a car, either! Since for you there are no
other options than these two modes of identification with Watten's
historical analogy to the car factory, the unstated conclusion to your
review is that Watten's essay is of no use to you as a poet-consumer.

h. More significantly (and this is why I don't think you quite re-enact that
first-attachment moment as I pose it -- and I pose it as a reading inscribed
within the idea of LP), the historical allegory itself seems to be of no
great use to you. Either that, or else you do not fully see / consider it as
I've spelled it out (which, in terms of identification, is a bit different
from Watten).

i. In other words, you do not see yourself as re-enacting that historical
moment so as to utopically re-imagine it at the very point of
collective/individual decision-making to either attach, or not, to the
consumerist model of identification. Why don't you? Because, part of the a
priori of your reading and poetics is a resistance to the idea of LP. That
resistance itself, however, is not articulated. It is more akin to
suppression than to fully-conscious resistance.

I got cantankerous over the weekend and solved (I hope) some personal and artistic muddles by writing an investigative poem ("Risk Management Toolkit") which I submitted to be read at an FDA hearing next week.  It's a complicated Washing medical/political/financial/etc. situation so don't try to sort it out.

I decided to solve some editorial muddles by making it the 2002 issue of M/M for health.  i apologize temporarily to those who sent in material - I just got into too many muddles and will sort out stuff by starting ab novo and going back to respond and sort stuff out.

There is new content on Fakelangoo.com
(http://www.sporkworld.org/PN/pn_71/html/index.php), the site devoted to the
exploration of Fake Language Poetry.  Please come visist and respond to it!

The site needs your input, however.  The fakelanpo movement, although
outlined in the articles on the site (which distinguish fakelangpo from
realangpo, langpo, and goodpangpo, based on the value of the ordered pair
(is fun to read, is fun to write) needs a manifesto.  It needs theorteical
unperpinings.  This is all the more difficult as it rejects theory as a mode
of definition of a poetic movement, preferring to focus instead on what
exactly the poetry in the moevement has in common when approached in a naive
way, eg textual analysis.

There are also a certain number of contributors to the site who have
misunderstood the meaning of Language Poetry and have written some atrocious
poetry and posted in to the site.  This is your opportunity to excoriate
them!  (Especially since it is not clear whenther said writers are real or
virtual...)

Finally, Fakelanpo was intended as a joke and it may not be funny enough.
So far it looks almost like a legitimate site (except for the fact that e.e.
cummings is a choice in the poll for your favorite Language Poet).
Something must be done to fix this.  Otherwise, someone may find this site
and come to believe that there reallly is a a fakelango movement and they
may join it and that would imply that they would promote language poetry
that is fun to read.  This could distort the entire genre and render the
theory moot because readers might chose the poetry based on naive criteria
of easy enjoyment.  Unless humor is added to my site, this may be a serious
risk!

(To post an article, first log in -- you have to register -- and then an
ption "Submit News" will appear in the "Modules" menu at the left of the
screen.  Follow the easy instructions.  Your story should appear within a
day.  If this doesn't work PLEASE EMAIL ME.  I am trying to keep an eye on
the bugginess of the system.)

Millie

P.S.

I think the error messages people got in the beginning were caused by me
doing administration at the same time as people were logged in-- they
happened whie I was adding stuff to the site.  If you get such messages,
please do not give up, come back later...and drop me a line to complain
about the errors so I can keep track.

I imagine you are waking up now and getting ready to take your walk to
university to teach your class. I imagine that all your students are
preparing for the class as well, hoping to impress the gorgeous-looking
young prof from Canada who unfortunately is taken by some mysterious
boyfriend back in Calgary. I imagine that your day will go smashingly smooth
and that you will come home and have a fantastic rest of the day relaxing
and reading  and playing puter games and eating and chatting and thinking,
hopefully! of your one and only lover who is always thinking of you!!!!

That would be me.

Your one and only,

louant

Dear Richard

Thanks. You make a good case. Yet I am going to differ.

While there will always be individuals prepared to be violent and apparently
without cause, it seems to me that the kind of suicide bombing taking place
in Palestine is atypical of human behaviour in its quantity and *unlike most
other kinds of civil war violence (Sierra Leone, Indonesia etc) You make
some useful comparisons.

Something odd is happening and I don't believe it can be explained by evil
people with power over the young, though they exist on both sides

If you treat people like dirt and then deny them all ability to retaliate
they will do desperate things and terrible things.

I have little real concern for govt leaders getting hit - live by the sword,
die by the sword - and could probably string out a whole ranked "theology"
of whom it is not so bad to attack... but in the situation that any
Palestinian resistance to what you rightly label colonialism find themself
in, the options are rarely available

Which leaves me facing the murder of people in the street. I can't endorse
it... I don't think they're that innocent. Much is made of the supposed
democracy of Israel and what is happening does seem to be the will of the
great part, which they finesse with parroted condemnations of terrorism.
(Take a standard speech against terrorism, btw, exchange the words
"terrorist" and "jew" and you get NAZI propaganda) But I wonder how the
world looks from within Israel. (I recall meeting people in Poland 30 years
ago who thought we were all rich in "the West" with no political control /
surveillance etc)

An individual might say *I wouldn't do that; and it is easy enough to say
that from the relative comfort of much Europe or N America or,I imagine, NZ.
But no one can say how they would behave in the same situations. The
examples you give are pertinent.

However, I live in UK so the image of USA overrun by Japanese is less than
potent for me. I can only think of it as b-movie. Germans in Whitehall
perhaps. But I find it difficult to relate to either because I didn't
experience the war; and my times in Germany have been relatively peaceful
and courteous.

You'll have to persuade me that I am responsible for the Holocaust, also
before my time. If guilt works backwards, then it seems to me that we are
getting very near to a version of original sin; and I gave up on all smells
and bells when I was 14, nearly 40 years ago

It seems to me that your argument, and you do not fully state it, would have
each  of us responsible for what is happening in Palestine. Again, I need
persuading that I am responsible for cynical theft and destruction and
murder to which I am opposed.

Despite your generous sharing of guilt (joke) you will be called
antisemitic, I'm afraid. Not by everyone, but my many. It's by far the
simplest way of dealing with complex issues and uncomfortable arguments -
similar to "red" etc - for those who have made up their minds for the long
haul

It's not that they *think you are anti-semitic. It doesn't work like that.
You will be called anti-semitic. Thought is at the service of defending
their argument. Think of a pack animal. It has brains. It uses its brains,
but not to consider its behaviour as a being with free will

That's why I worry about "heroes". The temptation is strong to counter in
like terms, but I believe that devalues the argument. If aggression is
wrong, we are hard put to condemn it by aggression and aggressive images.
Rather than heroes of  war, I'd like to offer "victims" or "fools" - that'll
bring an attack, always; but after millennia of slaughter it's time -
again - to refute the principle

Also, at a time when self-declared Christians are aligning themselves with
Israelis on the basis of the bible, it might be timely to assert a central
concept of Christianity - non violence

The Archbishop of Canterbury recently explained that when Christ counsels us
not to fight that only applies to individuals and not nation states; and
that indeed nation states have a duty to fight

Satan, were he to exist, has been busy

I was told a while ago, on the subject  of Palestine, that I clearly did not
know any history. I asked to be educated and was sent a summary of the
bible.

I asked for real history; and there was silence

I learned some history - and I studied history as an undergrad - and
reported back that my opposition to what is happening had strengthened

The other refused to discuss it

I see a pattern in this with the vehement resistance to any examination of
the bases of the state of Israel. Our chief rabbi says to ask the question
is proof  that one is anti-semitic; he asserts the evidence for  *this is
well-attested. I wrote to him and asked for the citation. He did not reply.

There is, I believe, no basis... There is a lot of documentation online incl
Balfour Declaration and the various expansions. One can infer a lot; but the
documents themselves are quite explicit - a homeland within Palestine, not a
state, all the way through until suddenly the policy of USA changed

At every stage, on the Israeli side, there has been an assurance that all
that is wanted is peace; and year by year the process extends. It extended
just now with the vote by Sharon's party against the establishment of a
Palestinian state

I am appalled by what is happening and I am - when I think about it -
terrified by the consequences

All the individual can do, I suppose, is to name the lies, as you have done;
but we must be careful to *try to at least implicitly offer an alternative
way of thinking about it

check out my subject line---that's the original subject line used by
andrew rathmann... whatever back-pedaling one finds in andrew's post,
it's that subject line of his that kinda summarizes his position (and
i mean, he chose it)...

reading jeffrey jullich's post, i never took him to say he was
talking about mfa's only (and in the 20th century, as we all know, so
many many poets have held advanced degrees)... jeffrey was talking
about the potential benefits of that sheepskin... if you equate
getting a college degree with necessary intelligence (whatever one
means by intelligence) then the conversation goes nowhere fast... it
doesn't go that far, either, if you equate it with acquiring a
skill---such as, e.g., writing steely prose... it starts to get kinda
interesting, though, when you consider 4+ years in terms of the
potential for individual and social change (via literacy, that
strange socializing concept)... i.e., one would have to think in
terms of the mission (if you will) of higher ed, its history, and how
it's changed over the past 150 years (anyway)... against which
possibility, let's say, there is a long and venerable tradition in
the u.s. of resistance to intellectual thought (and resistance as
well to professionalization)...

some of this is understandable, much of it is, well, obscurantist...

the real issue here, for me, has to do with the classroom... i.e.,
how what is learned is learned, and imagined to be learned... setting
aside academic self-loathing (which is plentiful), there is something
of a ritual in place even today in many creative writing classrooms
(and programs) whereby more energy is spent in defining what they're
NOT about than what they are about... 'we're not theory'... 'we're
not scholarship'... Etc... david radavich writes about this in the
annual mla mag ~profession~ (yeah---an extremely academic source, and
an extremely professionalized source at that)... see "Creative
Writing in the Academy" in ~profession 1999~, 106-112... radavich's
strikes me as something of a liberal-humanist critique, but at least
he sees outside of the text per se... i've cited kass fleisher's and
my long essay on creative writing at ~ebr~ (with responses by, among
others, radavich, lance olsen, marjorie perloff)---have a look at
that piece if you want a better idea of how things got to where they
are currently in creative writing... or so we say...

yes, things are pretty miserable in creative writing, i'd estimate,
but i come from a reform position... meaning, i'm an optimist... i
believe that creative writing as an academic practice ought to
constitute (1) a body of knowledge (and i use "knowledge" rather
broadly, to include lore, so defined), and (2) part of a larger
curricular orientation to make the world a better place, yep...

of course one can learn all sorts of things w/o going to college...
i'm curious---to follow joel kuszai's lead somewhat (if rhetorically,
as this list has a long ways to go, it seems, before most folks will
trust one another with such personal stuff), how many people on this
list have had NO college education?... granted, the social pressure
these days is such that one might have had little real choice in
opting for same, and might even have decided that the point of
schooling is unschooling, and so forth... but isn't the (more
sanguine) hope inherent to the educational system that it might
provide an opportunity for something akin to growth?... by growth, i
mean something like informed change... how could this, ipso facto,
NOT be of potential use to, let's say, thinkers?... i.e., from where
i sit, everyone... let alone, i mean, a society of thinkers... though
it might be damaging as well, sure, aren't the risks worth the
risk?...

hey, what are we talking about, anyway?...

best,

joe

Green Integer is pleased to announce two new titles, both reprinted
from Sun & Moon Press.

TENDER BUTTONS by Gertrude Stein ($10.95/1-931243-42-5), like its
Sun & Moon predecessor, is shot from the original pages of Stein's =
Claire
Marie (Donald Evans) edition of 1914. The Green Integer edition is =
covered
by a photograph of Stein from 1914.

DEFOE, by Leslie Scalapino, has been reformatted and re-typeset in the =
EL-E-PHANT
format of Green Integer books (6 x 9). Defoe is an epic where images of =
battle become meditations, an epice wherein events flap in silence as =
the narrative moves toward a place where the reader and text become one. =
The images of this fiction don't resemble events, but are new =
occurrences in time and space. ($15.95/1-931243-44-1)

If you plan to teach either of these popular titles, please remember to =
alert your bookstore
that they must now order the Green Integer editions (as before from =
Consortium Booksales
& Distribution in St. Paul or from Small Press Distribution in Berkeley)

As usual, we are offering a 20% discount for all members of all our =
mailing list.

Subject:      a question and a half about academic criticism
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

This replies to Robert Corbett who, when he asked for a reply from
"Jeff,"
I suspect meant me (and not Jeffrey Jullich), as Aaron had defended
the spirit of my remarks with paragraphs from a Public Interest
article Jeffrey Jullich called "bad attitude: anti-intellectual," and
moved the question of the poet-scholar's social role back to Chris
Stroffolino's ground of trying to discern what Andrew Rathman (whom I
defended) might have meant in attacking academic criticism's malign
effect on poets. Then also J Kuszai asks an earnest question of the
nature of politics and this list, which Louis Cabri echoes in wondering
how Aaron views his own view of things. I package the discussion up as
it
stood on Friday, and of course it has dispersed since then. To those
willing to respond (howeverso) to what I wrote, and to those who remain
silent (for posting to this
listserve is a little like residing in an American Embassy abroad
where they
barely tolerate us but we do do diplomacy -- for what if we didn't?)the
same dictum
(from Lawrence)applies: Be still when you have nothing to say; when
genuine
passion
moves you, say what you have to say and say it hot. There was a question
of whether Aaron
thought of his views as affirming the status quo, and I think what
Lawrence is getting at here is that if you say it hot, the "what" will
not have achieved status until you stop: at the
least.

As to whether Aaron thinks of himself on the margins,
or at the center, or whether that distinction itself isn't "laughably
outdated" (a tht Louis Cabri entertained) -- I have a question about
this,
too,
one that gets to J Kuszai's premonition of the political. One of my
anxieties
about this listserve is the frequent enough premise on it of continuity
between communities
involved in literary experiment and political virtue seemingly quite
apart from activism,
or even citizenly virtue, however we define it.  This premise of
continuity raises,
quite simply, for me, the problem of literary anarchism.  What is
literary anarchism? Anarchism is a kind of social experiment, in which
one community is rent in order to initiate a more natural order.
Whether I'm to presume literary anarchism exists persists as a question
when I read
postings like
Kasey Mohammad's recent satiric, as well as his sober,
appeals for a kind of reform-conscious political incoherence with (I
take it)regard to
literary affairs, though I would construe as a liberal reform agenda
such extenuations as Robert M. Corbett's fine defense(in reply
to Aaron Belz's plea for me) of the University and its production of
writers and, in
general studies, literate people. (Joe Amato's recent post speaks to the
"sanguine hope" of this tradition, as well.) My own politics I describe as
conservative anarchist
though when asked to cop for the anarchism I'm as shy as the next guy,
'cause who wants
to produce a resume of campaigns and arrests?  In any case, literature
is always having to prove
itself answerable to life, and so is the teaching of literature, as
Robert Corbett was telling
Aaron. I became involved in this thread when I defended Andrew Rathman
from being
asked to be clearer in his "ugly rant" against academic criticism; it
struck me as the
sovereign saying: No, Andrew, it's only I who may call out the crisis.
But as this
listserve is a community of poets and scholars our self-regulation
ought to spare us
whatever coercion the market demands; and it struck me as
deeply
coercive for the gentlemen explaining the experimental writing of the
listserve's
masters to be suggesting to a young something-or-other that his critique
of
academic
publishing wasn't clear. (It repeats at least several of the conditions
under which
early seventies experimental writing bolted from the teachings of their
New
Critical masters.)   Likewise Aaron's being told his crummy little
Public
Interest article is full of cliche. If so, then I believe the anarchist
question
would be, how do we reconfigure the public culture of this list so that
the corrective
teachings of Mm. Cabri, Jullich and Corbett still have their force in
the community of scholars but resist being construable as the genteel
defense of the
silent masters who read
said postings but also dole out the jobs, the grants, the
book-publication-prizes? Is the list, in other words, the setting for true
speech?  I ask -- I do not know.
And it was in this context that the state-of-the-profession -- and my
own job search --
became, and becomes, immediately relevant to me:  So, I hope it will be
clear to Robert Corbett,
that my real emphasis here isn't -- as perhaps it ought to be?
-- all the terrific
experiences I've had on the University campus you describe as in a state
of health viz. the
society of business-people and other public watchdogs (the media?
the
govt.?), but rather the
possibility for colleges of arts and sciences to get their own back, to
regain the ground they've
lost over the last 30 years to other areas in the University. Perhaps
the reconfiguring of the
culture of this list (as a virtual college) would be one step in that
direction.

I took that subj. line to be hyperbolic (a flag to draw attention), based on
the qualification in the post itself that "This does not mean that all
academic criticism is bad," i.e., bad to read or harmful to one's
intellectual health, and the revelation of the target of the "rant" to be
"distorting forces" of the professional academic system on critical
discourse.

But I have been backchanneled enough (belittling) 'back-off' warnings from
Jeffrey Jullich to have lost some interest the thread.  Sorry, I thought
Andrew's post had merit.

First of all, I am not _that_ ignortant of the motives of the Language
Movement.  I appropve of them.  I just don't see the intimate connection
between the theory and the particular kind of poetry written in the Language
school.  I think the poetry of many other schools alse serves to emphazsize,
says, the physicality of language, its existence separate from its meaning
(an idea that goes back to Saussure at least), and so on.  For example this
particlular aspect of theory is perhaps more embodied by the truly
meaningless syllables of some Dada poetry from the 30's than by a poem by
say, Ron Silliman, in which ine may discern multiple meanings and ine is
hardly struck first by the absence of sense but by the richness of what is
left.  I have, for instance N/O, which to someone naive apperas to be a
collection of little pems, wriotten in several (identifiable or at least
describable using past vicabulary) styles.  The connections between the
fragments are vague, but as one reads one begins to feel it coming together.
And then one realized s this may be an illusion based on the human need to
make things make sense even when they don't.  So in that sense, the N/O
shows language "being itself" and SUBTLY not making sense while convincing
us that it does make sense (which is interesting psychologically).  On the
other hand, things in it do make sense,. Themese, settings, styles recur,
and again, one expects patterns, perhaps finding them when they aren't even
there.  And so on.

HOWEVER, my point is that entirely different poetry, poetry which would
look, taste, and feel different to the reader could illustrate the same
thing.  For example, there are texts so complex that they might as well be
nonsense, and these texts give the same idea.  Foe example Finnegan's Wake.
(and don't say "it makes perfect sense you just haven't read it.  I have
read some of it and some of it seems to make perfect sense but it it is
uncklear to what extent we are imposing the meaning on it rather than
getting it from the text,  Or even Pound's Cantos make this point.  Given
Pound's mental state, we cannot be sure that they ever (some of them) made
sense to anyone.  Of course there are passages of astonishing clarity but
then it gets murky pretty fast.  And again, the fact that readers make
meaning rather than textx imparting menaing on readers is foregrounded.

I realize there is more to Language Poetry Theory than this single
observation.  But the same idea holds.  It ios possible to study the theory
of Langugae Poetry (like from the original book by Bernstein and Andrews) or
it is possible to studiy Language POEMS, i.e. poems produced by the Language
movement.  And if one opens up the field of Language poetry to poets who are
unaware, uninterested or opposed t the theory of Language Poetry but merely
like the style, then we have a new genre of poetry, which is what I have
called Fake Language poetry.  It was only half a joke.  I sometimes write in
that style, but simetimes not.  Writing in that style should be a stylistic
option for anyone, who would not have to become 100% committed to a movement
to write that way.  They could even write in terza rima the next day, or,
god forbid, like Carl Dennis or Seamus Heaney,

There is new content on Fakelangoo.com
(http://www.sporkworld.org/PN/pn_71/html/index.php), the site devoted to the
exploration of Fake Language Poetry.  Please come visist and respond to it!

The site needs your input, however.  The fakelanpo movement, although
outlined in the articles on the site (which distinguish fakelangpo from
realangpo, langpo, and goodpangpo, based on the value of the ordered pair
(is fun to read, is fun to write) needs a manifesto.  It needs theorteical
unperpinings.  This is all the more difficult as it rejects theory as a mode
of definition of a poetic movement, preferring to focus instead on what
exactly the poetry in the moevement has in common when approached in a naive
way, eg textual analysis.

There are also a certain number of contributors to the site who have
misunderstood the meaning of Language Poetry and have written some atrocious
poetry and posted in to the site.  This is your opportunity to excoriate
them!  (Especially since it is not clear whenther said writers are real or
virtual...)

Finally, Fakelanpo was intended as a joke and it may not be funny enough.
So far it looks almost like a legitimate site (except for the fact that e.e.
cummings is a choice in the poll for your favorite Language Poet).
Something must be done to fix this.  Otherwise, someone may find this site
and come to believe that there reallly is a a fakelango movement and they
may join it and that would imply that they would promote language poetry
that is fun to read.  This could distort the entire genre and render the
theory moot because readers might chose the poetry based on naive criteria
of easy enjoyment.  Unless humor is added to my site, this may be a serious
risk!

Ric,

parody is one of the highest forms of flattery.  a greater disservice to
language whatever is wrought by pedestalling the writers involved.  no one
is contesting that "the works of Bruce Andrews and Ron  Silliman" are
important, or "far too serious".  but nothing should be free from "inane
displays of sophmoric parody".  your feelings about "the major proponents of
langpo" places them safely into the vanguard, and effectively counteracts
any attempts that were made, by Bernstein for example, to question and
subvert the authoritative position you desire for lang(uage)po(etry).  sure
they'll have an effect, sure language poetry will ring through the halls,
"the academy of the future is opening its doors and is willing" to misquote.

i had no idea they were together...!  sorry for being sophmoric, it's my

well my 2nd and last for the day:

aaron, i'm not picking on *you*... i might be understood as picking
on andrew r., but i'd prefer it were my remarks taken, in any case,
in the spirit of spirited exchange.. i didn't esp. appreciate
andrew's post, not least b/c of its same old same old provocation...
i.e., that the academy "distorts" b/c of professional pressures
(which of course it does---like  other institutionalized settings, as
some have pointed out)...

granted, the academy is a powerful social-cultural institution, and
needs must be held accountable for its distortions... but that goes
for the folks on this list too, yes?...

so, i suppose i must be even more critical, and more detailed... ok
then: "The annoying outcome is that those who really succeed within
the system know only the professionally approved ways of talking
about literature"... this follows from andrew's apt assertion that
"The academic's first problem is how to advance professionally"...

uh, let's take the latter first:  damn straight, i say again, and
what's wrong with that?... not a goddamn thing!... it's march or DIE
(professionally), so tenure comes first if you're in a tenure-track
position... does this imply that one should don clogs and trample
over the top of any and every living thing that gets in one's way?...
of course not... to suggest that trying to keep one's JOB (it's a
job) as an academic professional ipso facto compromises one's
integrity (that's the suggestion, as i read it), hence compromises
one's poetry, is kinda---well, ok, playing the believing game, i'll
grant that such pressures *can* distort one's work... my, but that's
a major insight, isn't it?... working for gm on the assembly line can
similarly distort one's work... the difference can only be that
someone (andrew?) perceives the latter as inherently more honest than
the former... i can even understand why---i mean, why one might think
this way, regardless how wrong-headed it may be... but as we're
supposed to be interested in a balanced and considered exchange of
ideas (right?), i would expect us all to greet such same old same old
claims with at least a modicum of suspicion...

hey, why am i spending so much time defending academe anyway?... it
seems to me we would all do better to be spending such time
*critiquing* corporate earth...

but to continue:  i'd like to be hard on academic institutions too,
b/c i'd like to make them better... only, if you start with the
premise that mere success in said institution is undesirable (for
poets, never mind other, uhm, trades), well---where do we go from
here?... NOWHERE... well, not unless you all care to hear me go on re
how tenure & promotion might be reconceived to do justice to creative
writing---but then, you'd all end up saturated with a discussion of
the very institution that i'm getting the feeling is being dissed out
of hand...

and now my customary turn toward the autobiographical, as i take this
all rather personally (sorry):  have *i* "really succeed[ed]" within
the system?... as i don't believe in false modesty, i would say yes,
barring another tenure denial next year... i mean, it would be
dishonest of me, knowing what i know of academe, to suggest that a
2/2 at a carnegie I research institution in boulder, colorado
(whatever its problems) is anything but creamy & delicious... but i
must ask, b/c my integrity is being impugned (based on andrew's broad
brush):  have i earned it?...

well that's kinda difficult to say, isn't it?... or, yes and no...
yes, i've worked for it, no, nobody "earns" this sorta job finally...
in my moral universe, there's just too damn much luck involved...

so to follow through:  i must "know only the professionally approved
ways of talking about literature" then, or i'm an anomaly...

well, maybe i AM an anomaly, b/c i hope to christ i don't know only
the professionally approved ways of talking about literature (though
i think i know those pretty well too)... but if i'm an anomaly, i'm
not alone (based on my own little empirical survey of academe lo
these past 15 years or so---please take my word for it)... it's
possible, in a more stridently self-glorifying vein, that i might be
esp. idiosyncratic in the degree to which i've been willing to let
tenure pressures dictate what and how i write...

i don't think so... but you be the judge, ok?...

what i'm saying, in any case, is that i don't find the sort of
critique contained in andrew rathmann's post of particular value in
getting at what's wrong with academia, or in trying to make what's
wrong, right... nope, i guess i just don't buy it, as i see his post
as itself a distortion---and yep, this is coming from someone who's
now inside, who's spent plenty of time outside and inside-outside,
and who often feels, on the inside, like an outsider...

best,

as far as the suggestion that there ought to be a history of langpo -
i'd be very interested in reading such a history of langpo.  or see
such a map of the present, including buffalo and other locales of
interest - how do these "institutions" ("matrices" of action + $)
form? what is their constitution? everyone seems to be so focused on
langpo around here. my golly, is that all there is?  anyhow, a
"social, collective history" of how that movement got started and how
it was organized and was later received (especially in this space)
would be interesting. Yet the response to langpo seems disorganized.
Perhaps that's a good thing, I have no idea.

Such a project would require a kind of fieldwork of a social science
nature. What materials and/or behaviors would be studied?

anyhow- this is something i've wondered for a long time. When I was
first being brainwashed into the Langpo world, I noticed (through a
systematic study of "small magazines" as part of an indexing
assignment up in the the poetry library castle) that many of the
so-called langpos originated their stylistic "revolutions" long
before finding others with whom to associate. Anyhow, it's  still a
theory - right? It's a simple theory, but one that dispells some of
the conspiracy theories, since many of the conspiracy theories (about
secret meetings of the berkeley langpo council, etc.) would come
later. One case study would have to involve "Truck" - the magazine,
if I remember correctly, edited by David Wilk first while at Yale and
then for a few years afterward. Anyhow, I may have this all wrong -
but I seem to remember either an early edition of "Truck" which had a
more scattered editorial identity, full of poets of his immediate
surroundings, classmates, presumably. I don't have a strong sense of
his history--he's someone I've always wanted to talk to--but I gather
he went on (after Yale, but how long after finishing?) for an MFA
and/or phd (or did he?). At one point under his direction of the
literature division of the NEA he was able to provide funding for
journals such as Watten's This-- and others. (Please correct me as I
may have this all wrong; again, my interest in having something
written down which would at least get his side of the story
straight). One could probably get access to records which would make
it clear what happened. He eventually went on to found a major
independent distributor--I think it was Inland.  You see where this
goes. I really don't have the information that I would need to fill
in a David Wilk piece. But it's there. And what does it tell us? It
would be interesting to analyze the facts from a variety of
viewpoints. For example, by wanting to study such formations, I am
trying to learn something about those formations-- I'm not
necessarily advocating them. One of the conclusions I might draw
would look at the nature and role of the "paper" zine in isolated
settings, as opposed to the digital scene. I'm curious to know how
this medium, for example, extends and limits the possibility of
making things happen in smaller groups. High school students would be
a good place to examine this- as well the urban settings for literary
gatherings - not just slams but the "communities" constituting
different groups in cities like new york, philadelphia, boston,
buffalo, and so on. Educational factories like Suny buffalo and
Temple and NYU or CUNY or UChicago, SFState, etc.etc., play a
functional role in how it plays out. but there are other factors....
what are they?

random thoughts for new subjects:

1. does anyone remember the "Caterpillar Poets"? I think that's what
they were called. It was promoted in Caterpillar Magazine (ed
Eshleman, dean of langpos)? It included poets like Diane Wakoski,
Robert Kelly (? maybe) and many others -- it was sort of a packaged
poetry tour. I'd be curious to know if they ever went on tour, what
happened, etc

2. I've decided I'm just not going to reply to personal attacks.  the
thesis which motivated my original question about the political was
that as far as I've ever seen, "we" as in each other, are not the
enemy. personally, i'd like to just begin with that premise and see
where we can go.  i'll take some beatings, but not for long. i just
can't bear it. i'm not sure why some people seem motivated to make
things personal. joe even considers my question about politics to be
personal. i don't see it that way.  i don't mean it to be taken
personally. and again, i'm really thinking of these poets and critics
who are coming from positions wherein the political underpinnings of
the arguments are not clear. Like people who interrupt themselves to
say, "You know what I mean?" -- there are these "political arguments"
that are made. I don't care if people want to make political
arguments (I'm not sure if I do or not) -- but we're supposed to just
share assumptions that are often corroded when examined. I think
making them clear is helpful to those positions-- whatever they are.
If you're not thinking about it - fine. I'm not asking for people to
be interested in that. I'm just curious to know what people are
thinking about in that regard. If they don't want to talk about it,
fine! No problems. Remember, participation is *only* voluntary.

3. a good example of I'm talking about is the new journal edited by
Jonathan Skinner, called ECOPOETICS.  A read of the introduction to
the journal demonstrates how uncomplicated - and happily possible -
to initiate discussion in an area that is itself quite complictated.
The table of contents demonstrates diversity of poetic interests.
Contributors are various and cannot be said to represent any
particular orientation to aesthetic value--in other words, they're
all "language poets" and none of them are "language poets". Anyone
who knows Jonathan knows that he's a complicated person with diverse
interests, so the journal usefully reflects this range of thought.
The journal is called "Ecopoetics" -- what is up with that? There is
the word "poetics" once again merged with a prefix. The question of
our ecology is not "personal" in the sense that one of the premise
I'd assume is at work concerns the issue of our situatedness in a
larger "web" (as he calls it). Such such situatedness is not
voluntary, but choosing to make it the focus for a journal is
interesting. It's a challenge, I think, do try it, and I think while
it raises issues of the sort that I've been alluding to a little,
Jonathan has not simply adopted a sloganeering and propagandistic
approach to thinking through the problems.  How is a journal going to
deal with these issues? What are the poetics of "environmentalism"?
What is "ecopoetics"? What is Ecology? The masthead of the journal
says that ecology is the "theory and praxis of deliberate
earthlings?" It is complicated and he seems open to allowing it to be
so.  Now, how do these issues influence the choices he's made? The
editor's statement does quite a bit of work towards answering the
question. He begins "with an editor's restlessness" and quite
literally asks "how to accommodate" the "disparate parts of the day"
-- the tension between being indoors (work at desk) with "time spent
outside" (5).

"There might be no need for such reflection, if the creatures
encountered or thoughts crossed while walking under the sky somehow
made their way into poems written inside, at the relative safety of a
desk. But conditions for outside discoveries, in human language arts
at the turn of the millennium, feel narrow: generally, walks do not
make it into the enclosed environments of today's best poetry.

"Whether this is because poetry has turned the bulk of its energies
toward accomodating, or resisting, capitalist "schizophrenia"
(symptom in part of the enormous time done, by knowledge workers, at
desks) or whether "nature" is more deliberatly edited out by writers
alert to ideological and historical trappings, is hartd to say. That
most of today's poets are driven to cities, rather than exiled to the
country, may also be a factor. (Which mostly means that the sense of
"pastoral" needs to be updated.) In any case, at least since Homwre
poetry has been working hard to lose "nature."  (5)

In one paragraph, Skinner makes a connection worth considering.
Skinner says that the while the "developing complexity of perception
is technology-induced" it is dependent also upon our knowledge of the
world and it's complexities. Lamenting that the "natural history
tradition" which provided a "discipline of close, scrupulous
observation of nature," is "disappearing," undergoing a process of
"deinstitutionalization" (6). The subsequent loss of funding for
"basic natural history research" means that many of the world's
mysteries (such as the "95% of the species suspected to inhabit the
world") will remain unknown to us (6).

So how to approach this issue in a poetry journal? As he says,
"transparent narratives of self-discovery, or solipsistic,
self-expressive displays, seems ill-suited to the current crisis; art
alive to the differentiating nature of its own materials may be
better equipped."  He goes on to say that "From such a perspective,
avant-garde poetry's finickiness about 'nature' is regretful" and he
cites several examples of poets who have contributed "sustained
investigations of nature, and disciplinary crossing". The journal, as
he sees it, will be a "site open to the contradictions such work
often willingly engages and embodies ... where different disciplines
can meet and complicate one another" (6).

The essay goes on and further specifies the issues in terms of
globalization, ecology and poetics. Citing mycologist Paul Stamets,
he ends with the description of Ecopoetics as a "mobile contamination
unit" and urges the reader to go outside (8).

A review of the journal's contents demonstrates that the "content" of
the pieces relate in ways that make a simple review impossible. Let
it suffice to say that the range of materials and presentational
modes is wide and diverse. Noted contributors include  people from
this list, including Catherine Daly, Marcella Durand, Kevin Killian,
among others. Contains translations of Cecilia Vicuna by Rosa Alcala
and work by Regis Bonvicino with by Odile Cisneros presented en face.
Fans of Robert Kocik will note a significant contribution from him.
Contains "further notes" after contributor notes, with interesting
statements from some of the poets included, as well as "further
reading" links. Too many other things to mention right now... but
check it out.

Anyhow- just some thoughts.

Ya know
I'm all for a good parody,
but it seems to me that
ignorance of the motives of a
poetic movement does not hold much
validity, at least in my eyes.
The major proponents of langpo
were and are engaging in very
serious issues which involve
all of us and ultimately will
have a ripple effect on the
history of poetics.
I'm sorry, but the works of
Bruce Andrews, Ron Silliman,
etc (just to name a couple)
are to me, far too serious to spoof
with an inane display of sophomoric parody.

Lawrence.  You are a very thoughtful person. This is a good response: we are
more or less on the same side of the fence. I also dont know how I would
react to extremis....your reaction to civilians being killled etc is human.
I'll think about your email. I just thought of Yeat's lines:

               A terrible beauty is born.

    And:  "The worst are full of passion, the best lack all
conviction".(Cant recall the exact quote).  Rhetoric of course....but great
poetry reflecting some truths by a great poet.
By the way I dont neccessarily agree with the "there will always be
individuals prepared to do violence"  ...well, prepared to do - yes in self
defence as is sometimes neccessary  - but hopefully not always and I think
that the Palestinians and the Israelis COULD live together in that area
especially if the Palestinians were given better living conditions (some
international aid is required now) and so on: the UN needs to intervene this
time (normally I'm opposed to that but like Jugoslavia the slaughter has
gone on too long. (Regardless of fault, and we shouldnt overlook historical
"wrongs" by both "sides" so to speak).  I hope Bush is genuine in his
advocacy of  separate state for Palestine. But I know what you are saying re
being accused of being anti-semitic. I actually wanted to find if my
grandfather was of Jewish descent, mainly to see how I would still feel. I
think he was and changed into what in Germany before the war was an
"assimilated German (Englishman)" for purposes of his petit bourgeois
ambitions which he achieved somewhat.  In other words, at one level, he was
a wheeler and dealer in London! You may have a less flattering term!! Or as
I joked to soneone else on the list, he could have just been a wog of  some
kind!!!  (My brother eg looks like an Arab or a Jew ...that is someone from
that part of the world...Goebbels wouldnt have had much time for him! (Im
reading a book about Speer by Gita Sereny hence my interest in these
political things...and the "soul searching" and so on...) Regards, Richard.
PS Its interesting (or maybe its not) but its true that many people who are
"part' or "half-caste" are sometimes the most racist. This may derive from
an inferiority complex or fear: but years ago my ex -wife discovered  some
letters by her (part Samoan ) cousin which were rabidly racist against
"bungas"  or "coons" etc (A derog term used  about Samoans, Tongans and so
on quite commonly by white working class esp. tradesmen level (the level
I've been mostly in)) who are (contrary to communist fairy stories) the most
racist group as they are competing for bread: for life ultimately.
Even Maori are more hateful of Polynesians (or they express this hate at
least (and Auckland is the biggest Polynesian city in the world population
wise)) as indeed one gets the strongest rivalries amongst those struggling
on a similar class level: while also it means they can be "good" (and in
agreement - more recently they ( and many Europeans) target "Asians" as many
people are both paranoid about them and (there are many here studying
English or with small busineses for example) and also jealous of thier
wealth...as I suppose many pre-war Germans were jealous of what they
supposed was the wealth of the Jews (not all were wealthy of course but that
aspect was used by the Nazis to divide) to their masters who are Europeans
who dominate New Zealand and most other rich countries.

 dear millie,
          looks to me you are kick-starting another site:
fakelangpocriticism. If not I would kindly suggest that The poetry of less
than perfect sense is a large and unwieldy topic.

First of all, I am not _that_ ignortant of the motives of the Language
Movement.  I appropve of them.  I just don't see the intimate connection
between the theory and the particular kind of poetry written in the Language
school.  I think the poetry of many other schools alse serves to emphazsize,
says, the physicality of language, its existence separate from its meaning
(an idea that goes back to Saussure at least), and so on.  For example this
particlular aspect of theory is perhaps more embodied by the truly
meaningless syllables of some Dada poetry from the 30's than by a poem by
say, Ron Silliman, in which ine may discern multiple meanings and ine is
hardly struck first by the absence of sense but by the richness of what is
left.  I have, for instance N/O, which to someone naive apperas to be a
collection of little pems, wriotten in several (identifiable or at least
describable using past vicabulary) styles.  The connections between the
fragments are vague, but as one reads one begins to feel it coming together.
And then one realized s this may be an illusion based on the human need to
make things make sense even when they don't.  So in that sense, the N/O
shows language "being itself" and SUBTLY not making sense while convincing
us that it does make sense (which is interesting psychologically).  On the
other hand, things in it do make sense,. Themese, settings, styles recur,
and again, one expects patterns, perhaps finding them when they aren't even
there.  And so on.

HOWEVER, my point is that entirely different poetry, poetry which would
look, taste, and feel different to the reader could illustrate the same
thing.  For example, there are texts so complex that they might as well be
nonsense, and these texts give the same idea.  Foe example Finnegan's Wake.
(and don't say "it makes perfect sense you just haven't read it.  I have
read some of it and some of it seems to make perfect sense but it it is
uncklear to what extent we are imposing the meaning on it rather than
getting it from the text,  Or even Pound's Cantos make this point.  Given
Pound's mental state, we cannot be sure that they ever (some of them) made
sense to anyone.  Of course there are passages of astonishing clarity but
then it gets murky pretty fast.  And again, the fact that readers make
meaning rather than textx imparting menaing on readers is foregrounded.

I realize there is more to Language Poetry Theory than this single
observation.  But the same idea holds.  It ios possible to study the theory
of Langugae Poetry (like from the original book by Bernstein and Andrews) or
it is possible to studiy Language POEMS, i.e. poems produced by the Language
movement.  And if one opens up the field of Language poetry to poets who are
unaware, uninterested or opposed t the theory of Language Poetry but merely
like the style, then we have a new genre of poetry, which is what I have
called Fake Language poetry.  It was only half a joke.  I sometimes write in
that style, but simetimes not.  Writing in that style should be a stylistic
option for anyone, who would not have to become 100% committed to a movement
to write that way.  They could even write in terza rima the next day, or,
god forbid, like Carl Dennis or Seamus Heaney,

Ya know
I'm all for a good parody,

ignorance of the motives of a
poetic movement does not hold much
validity, at least in my eyes.
The major proponents of langpo
were and are engaging in very
serious issues which involve
all of us and ultimately will
have a ripple effect on the
history of poetics.
I'm sorry, but the works of
Bruce Andrews, Ron Silliman,

are to me, far too serious to spoof
with an inane display of sophomoric parody.

There is new content on Fakelangoo.com
(http://www.sporkworld.org/PN/pn_71/html/index.php), the site devoted to the
exploration of Fake Language Poetry.  Please come visist and respond to it!

The site needs your input, however.  The fakelanpo movement, although
outlined in the articles on the site (which distinguish fakelangpo from
realangpo, langpo, and goodpangpo, based on the value of the ordered pair
(is fun to read, is fun to write) needs a manifesto.  It needs theorteical
unperpinings.  This is all the more difficult as it rejects theory as a mode
of definition of a poetic movement, preferring to focus instead on what
exactly the poetry in the moevement has in common when approached in a naive
way, eg textual analysis.

There are also a certain number of contributors to the site who have
misunderstood the meaning of Language Poetry and have written some atrocious
poetry and posted in to the site.  This is your opportunity to excoriate
them!  (Especially since it is not clear whenther said writers are real or
virtual...)

Finally, Fakelanpo was intended as a joke and it may not be funny enough.
So far it looks almost like a legitimate site (except for the fact that e.e.
cummings is a choice in the poll for your favorite Language Poet).
Something must be done to fix this.  Otherwise, someone may find this site
and come to believe that there reallly is a a fakelango movement and they
may join it and that would imply that they would promote language poetry
that is fun to read.  This could distort the entire genre and render the
theory moot because readers might chose the poetry based on naive criteria
of easy enjoyment.  Unless humor is added to my site, this may be a serious
risk!

perhaps, tho, it should be said that DADA was quite dead by the time the
30's came along (the French version morphing into Surrealism by 1923, the
Berlin version around the same time...the Zurich version fading, with Hugo
Ball, into the mountains). if you're considering Schwitters's work, tho, it
had, by that time, morphed into Merz...finding little sympathy from
Huelsenbeck...

perhaps it might be best to look back to the Italian & Russian Futurists
(Khlebnikov, Kruchenykh, Marinetti, etc.) for those roots...even further,
truthfully...check out Rothenberg's Technicians of the Sacred...or Tzara's
Poemes Negres...

>What are your politics? How does your political orientation inflect
>your poetry, your poetry criticism, or your teaching?

If I'm not mistaken, most list members are academics. So it's not hard to
figure out why what is politically correct on this list is pretty much
identical to what's politically correct in academia. Academics spend much of
their time rehearsing theories developed in a vacuum in order to gain the
approval of an academic establishment who have spent a lifetime developing
theories in a vacuum ...  I wouldn't mind living in an ivory tower myself,
but I think the isolation accounts for the popularity among academics of
Marxism, which is a brilliant articulation of an intricate paranoid
delusion, but which in actual practice causes Stalinism.

Anywhere that there is a large enough pile of shit the flies will find it,
especially on the internet, so there is this other group of people on the
list whose rantings can hardly be characterized as ideas -- who simply spew
sentiments of hate, wrapped in insanity-- and they have a  fan club who will
verbally stone you in the street for saying so.

What ties all of these odd bedfellows together, I think, is the romantic
notion of being an artistic and/or political dissident who in his/her own
conceit is simply avant of his/her time, above the common people of the
era.,
etc. .. i.e. ELITISM --always a magnet for people who are smarter than
everyone else, or who are insane, but also to those who are simply addicted
to expressions of bad intent toward the most people possible. The majority
opinion in democracies has always been a target for elitists, dictators,
kings, Stalinists and, by definition, sociopaths.

Terrorism is a decidedly non-democratic act in which the will of the one
subverts the will of the many.
Gandhi did not resort to terrorism because he, and his cause, were more just
than that.
Indeed, those who practice terrorism, and those who support them,
de-legitimize their cause and prove by their tactics that they will NEVER
support human rights.

So I am unashamed to say that I support the common/vulgar opinion that a
democracy has the right to defend itself against attacks on its own soil --
despite the abuse that position has been taking from the lunatic fringe on
this list.

I will stay tuned to the list despite the vile invectives of its most
verbose contributors because I refuse to let this vital forum for
experimental poetry be overrun by phonies, pretenders, and posers whose
agenda is political rather than artistic, and who shame the art I love by
giving it a reputation as the practice of a bunch of kooks.

 1. The discusssion list is alive again!

 2. This coincides with the return to it of some familiar names.

 3. The Buffalo list is the first list I belonged to; I joined well
    before the meltdown. No list I have been on since, or the Buffalo
    list itself, has been as lively.

 4. The community of this list has changed from those 'good old days'
    and it seems to be changing again.

 5. The list community is a patchwork of geographically particular --as to
cities, countries--groupings, members of localities, 'scenes' --patchwork
itself seems to change. As I am further away and travel is a bigger issue,
this geography is a special interest; I think all the Americans on the list
automatically place most of the members to an extent I cannot. I take this
sort of detached interest in the notices of readings; I can track the
movements of poets from venue to venue.

Subject: Your views of your views...


1. My view is a dim one of my views. But, like a good Sartrean cosmonaut,
here goes the wobbly eye.


2a. I tend to want to envision the listserv as an outrageously, flagrantly
utopic, reflexively present-tense enactment (or set of -s). This view's been
steady-as-it-goes, since my very first post (what a grunt!).

b. I am the extreme minority in holding such a listserv view. My minority
status on the issue has for the most part always been so. "I" am the last
lingering trace here of a former boiling 'pulse'. But, flarf we must.

c. The lackluster e-ception that my Planned Utopia has received, fellow
cosmonauts, reflects significant differences between us! [*Would the
delegate from the central provinces please rise and state his case.*] These
differences "speak," in my case, to a historical relationship I hold with
this listserv (back to 1996 -- yet for others, to the Big Bang itself) --
which should pass for an acknowledgement of how Language poets had the
impact of a tsunami over me growing up in the '80s in surfless sands of
seams ("White out there!").

d. "Now... just... hold on.... What has 2a -- 'planned social utopia' -- to
do with the latter part of 2c, 'Language poetry'?! I have no idea how
'utopic social collective critique' connects to LP! I've never read anything
like that in the histories of this messily indefinable grouping of poets,
critics, itinerant thinkers ...."

e. (So much to write about...so little about time!) Actually, I feel
enormously happy for you, d. Still, poetry "moments," when they occur, do
invoke the socially utopic -- for a time, anyway.


3a. Language poetry doesn't pose the social crisis for poetry today, as it
(once) posed the crisis of poetry for Chris S (or Kent Johnson, among others
here and elsewhere). This is *not* news. What *is* recent news, to me at
least, is that LP seems to have become a Palgrave's Anthology for the 21C,
neat-o cool stuff that is "different" from the Palgrave's Anthology of the
19C -- and yet purchasable as a set! Dichten = Condensare...

b. As much as I loathe to bring this up once again, the beginning of a
self-satisfyingly comfortable and settled indifference to LP began to
express itself specifically on this list with -- HG. That is *partly* (only
partly) why his perfectly even-tempered, nice and witty posts incited such a
suppressed furor, I believe -- his was an untimely meditation, his the
fully-achieved Null Point far ahead of its time! -- which is to acknowledge
that I and others were partly to blame (yet with no regrets!) for what
resulted, since "we" had, then, a different agenda for the listserv. -- Even
though, as I say, I mostly lurked, and did not discuss any of this with
others backchannel -- AND NOW DO YOU SEE how an ideology of social utopic
critique hailed me like a great white bird, only too well, friend?? But, let
me lean on you just awhile longer, please let me tell you my story to the
end! ("You're fucking wedding can wait!!").


4a. "If poetry is the mole of history, what am I doing on this listserv!"

b. Aaron Bombeck doesn't know...


5. "There are worse fates."


6a. Now go, play with your letters, and come back with a happy, a-social,
Oulipo utopia of one -- befitting The Computer Age.

b. "Cosmonaut! your nephew's cat is nick-named Turd -- The plastic pink
pencil case you took to public school is keepsaked in a $5 ply mini-dresser
bought off a construction boss you had once, he was not a stingy flint but a
junk dealer too -- You have seen your favorite cartoon now, Rocky &
Bullwinkle, once, and that was last week, it's nice to know the experience
of having a favorite for moments that beckon their recognition, like this
one -- Your shoes, hand-me-downs from Dad's only serious, persistent
clothing expenditure, his search for the best custom shoes for flat feet --
Your favorite author photo, David Hess playing a joke on ubpoetics --"

How did you know all this?!

"I am the future of the past you will now no longer need, cosmonaut! Harken
to the sound! There, just there, something new, there -- just over
there!!!!!! It is yet faint! indistinguishable! but, for you! You must leave
now, and disappear."

Leonard.  Very impressive: but, one problem, I'm not an academic: and not a
marxist and dont hate Jews or Israelis and dont always support terrorism
(sometimes read freedom fighter tactics), nor do I "dominate" the list -see
that Lawrence Upton disagreed with me and I accepted that...I dont want to
claim the moral upper ground...I partly agree that some of  us are a bit
cracked...I think that  romantic notion (quite seriously) has been with
people/artists since at least the time of Sophocles and Euripidies, and I
think that in a sense "madness" is an energising force for creative
peole.... Anyway: people always argue the toss about things: it doesnt mean
that I or (most) on this list are at each others throats: my best mate
disagrees with most of my politics: every where one goes one encounters
disagreement.
  Now if Israel was being attacked by a superior force and so on I would
agree with you (Israel DOES have a right to defend itself but where defence
is attack is problematic)...Israel at its best has made some great
acheivements but these I feel have been ruined by such as Sharon's party.
Being a democracy can be a convenient hide  for incipient or actual fascism:
witness Nazi Germany....Hitler was voted into power.  Now, if your country
was overrunn by a foreign power at what point would you resist? Or would you
just turn away? I also have to aknowledge that I've never been faced with a
military force: as wystan says it all seems very remote over here in NZ so I
suppose in that sense I can "hide" over here and take pot shots! Would I
stand up and getinto a real fisticuffs? Would I go so far as to volunteer to
becoe a bomb? OK ... but that's one advantage of not being directly
involved.....and so on...maybe I would just get the hell pout of Palestine
if I could....who knows? Maybe I'd fight....
    But how is it that in Palestine there are "sudennly" a whole lot of
"maniacs" ...I dont think they are. I read a book by an ex Israeli soldier
(trabslated from Hebrew)(which gave a reher (well not such a nice picture)
of Israel. Is thinking things: eg that suicide bombing might be a legitimate
tactic: does that make one "evil"?
  I also love poetry but language poetry (for example - probably even much
other "styles" of poetry also -  has always had as one of itys "planks" the
intertwine if you like of politics and text etc There is no "innocent text"
and so on ... nor do  I know (personally) anyone on the list (except wystan
and i doubt he agrees with me much and good on him) (I know one or two other
NZrs but they are mainly lurkers - nothing wrong with that.)
  I dont think most people are unequivocal about the situation in Israel: I
would be the only one to (express) suppport (of) suicide bombing when it
seems that it is the only defence or way of  gaining one's land and life
back. But now I think that the UN must step in and dictate to Palestine AND
Israel to end the mess.
Are these things non-debatable? Is poetics now bloodlessly unppoitical? Did
S11 not happen?  OK. That's a bit unfair...at least you also have strong
opinions. Good on you.
 Richard.

Does it have a web version?  That's how you would dostribute it online.

If it's an annual obviously you won't have any articles or new articlea
often, but you'll want a web site the gives the theme, aims, and outlook of
your jpurman, and calls for submissions (even if you want the submissions by
regular mail in an envelope etc. only).

You may want to make the web version progressive (adding an article every so
often) rather than annual.  It will make people revisit the site whereas
just saying there wil be a full issue in a year won't.

To publicize, write a paragraph explainaing your journal, and post it here
(POETICS) and to lists which may also be interested such as wryting,
webartery, imitationpoetics, there are surely more...   Also post to USENET
newsgroups "Google Groups" for instance that are relevant, such as anything
relating to art history, english studies, etc.  But do this carefully.  Post
only to one group in a hierarchy so as not to appear to be "crossposting"
obnoxiously.  For example only one art hostory group, even if there are 6
groups on art history.

Finally, in your website, include meta keywords (this is part of the HEAD
section of the HTML defining the home page) describing your site sp that the
search engines can find the site.

If you are REALLY serious about publicity, you can submit your web page to
the search engines to try to come up in the first few journals...

I am looking for any online resources that might help me promote / publicize
/ list / distribute Fulcrum: an annual of poetry an aesthetics. Any pointers
would be greatly recommended!

Also looking for tips on distributing the journal in Canada and Greta
Britain.

Many thanks in advance!

Ya know
I'm all for a good parody,
but it seems to me that
ignorance of the motives of a
poetic movement does not hold much
validity, at least in my eyes.
The major proponents of langpo
were and are engaging in very
serious issues which involve
all of us and ultimately will
have a ripple effect on the
history of poetics.
I'm sorry, but the works of
Bruce Andrews, Ron Silliman,
etc (just to name a couple)
are to me, far too serious to spoof
with an inane display of sophomoric parody.

Dear richard,
             on the subject of racism. There is not a country in the
world without racism.There is not a country in the world without
sexism. People just don't get along with eachother even in the family
unit.The
fundamental problem I believe is 'Understanding' or love.I knew a
guy who hated islanders to the hilt,and after several years got married
to one and had kids too. 'Tolerance' is also another important word.
Without tolerance,nothing can be acheived.

I am confused

|  Now if Israel was being attacked by a superior force and so on I would
agree with you (Israel DOES have a right to defend itself but where defence
is attack is problematic)

I found heroising suicide bombers hard enough. But do you think it is
defensible to have suicide bombing only as long as it doesn't achieve its
aims?

As a non-academic, Leonard...

Academics need proof. Finally, assertion will not do. And terms have to be
defined.

I wonder if you have any psychiatric training, because you are free with a
range of terms to do with mental illness from "paranoid delusion" to "kook".
Because you tend towards the slang rather than the scientific, the abusive
rather than the analytical, I think that either your training did not go
very far or that you learned it from an ambitious cereal packet.

Having dismissed Marxism - that must have been a very small cereal packet,
or maybe a bit of it got torn off - you use that catch-all word of abuse:
"Stalinism"... (And, no, you don't say what you mean by it)  One of the
features of Stalinism is the refusal to allow a voice to those who oppose
it, on the grounds that they are mad. A whole fake psychiatry was built upon
it.

Another tactic is to seed the fear of groups within the body politic:

who will
| verbally stone you in the street for saying so.

Has this happened to you, or did you just say it? I ask because I worry that
you wish to label anyone you disagree with as dangerous, a dangerous wish
itself, and my suspicion is that you are exaggerating to that end

| Gandhi did not resort to terrorism because he, and his cause, were more
just
| than that.

No, it was because he was a pacifist and did not argue that he had a right
of self-defence. Most of them get murdered, often by those who claim the
right of self-defence.

| Indeed, those who practice terrorism, and those who support them,
| de-legitimize their cause and prove by their tactics that they will NEVER
| support human rights.

or an international court?

You do not define "terrorism". I suggest "political violence to which I am
opposed"

You do not define "democracy"... In what sense is a country a democracy
which has killed or forced out most of the potential voting population on
racist grounds, denying them a vote, and imported millions from other
nations also on racist grounds, giving them a vote?

And could you seek to achieve an answer without resorting to abuse - Beyond
any political agenda, poetry, which you tell us you love, demands care for
words; and the more one respects words in that love, the more one finds that
to speak at all is to be bound by the ethical and the political. To use
words to silence opposition or confuse issues, will finally destroy the
poetry within you

MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

1. Instigating Posts

a. Posts to the list, that either use vague language, and/or the fewest
words, and/or unsupported strong language, receive both the greatest
quantity of verbal response and the greatest attention by the greatest
number of participants -- who attempt to counter and even to rub out the
instigating vagueness with varying degrees of specificity. The list,
however, runs on an economy of vague expressions. While it is impossible, as
a respondent, not to attempt to counter (even by vague means) the
instigating vagueness, these efforts will always only be left behind, since
the motive power of the list's discourse -- the vague as such -- will have
already instigated a new set of distractions.


2. Reversing a Modernist Economy of Words

a. The post that most successfully instigates discussion is language charged
with meaning to the *least* possible degree. The emptiest post receives the
greatest effort to "fill it in." The least-worked-out comment receives the
most attention -- in hopes of "working it out" for all. The diffusely-stated
assertion is rallied-around in an energetic performance of giving it
structure, so as to concentrate its force (whereas, what actually happens is
the reverse: prolix expansion).

b. The listserv economy reverses the modernist dictum that to charge
language with the utmost meaning is to propel the best language forward.
What propels discourse forward on the listserv is vague, dispersed, "bad"
language, with the aim not of quality, but of quantity (which must therefore
be regulated -- much like a mechanical feeder, two posts per day, for every
listserv consumer).


3. The Inarticulate Status-Quo

a. The list is a form of democracy at work. Instigating posts more often
than not start from, and rarely leave, a common denominator of the vague.
Stylistic qualities characterizable as "ignorance," "laziness," "vagueness,"
"flatness," "rudeness," "unexamined premises," "bluntness,"
"indifference" -- these are some of the listserv's greatest motivating
affects and achievements. They drive the discourse to coalesce respondents
and to increase response -- to teach, to demonstrate a thrifty use of words,
to offer detail, to vary tone and registers of address, to show
considerateness, to analyse, to be subtle, to differentiate.... Alas, since
the actual motor of list discourse is vainly indifferent to and permanently
distracted from all these bettering efforts by respondents, nothing that
could be called "knowledge" or even "articulation" is ever instituted in
some prevailing way on the list, while these shows of details, the stylistic
variety, the subtlety, etc. devolve as merely idiosyncrasies of particular
respondents, features that are forgotten along with the posts they come
with. In short, articulate posts hinder the increase and diffusion of
discourse on the list. The list thrives on the inarticulate instigation from
the status quo.


4. Three Characteristic Rhetorical Styles of Instigation

a. Obvious one: The post that asks for information: Does anyone know about
X?

b. The post that, abruptly, rhetorically negates the validity of an entire
argument that has already developed a thread if not multiple threads. This
type of post *wants* to lash out, and does so in a general, confusing way,
so as to implicate as many potential respondents as possible, thereby
guaranteeing a massive increase in the quantity of discourse credited to the
vague subject.

c. The post that very simply and forcefully asserts something, and in the
vaguest language possible, preferably absent of connotation, let alone
denotation, and ambiguous only at the literal level of language so as to
ensure that many questions remain embedded in its language in an
unthought-out way, thereby admitting the greatest amount of error possible
and requiring the most amount of respondent attention to be devoted to its
unraveling, parsing, reading, speculation, etc -- this effort only to be
denounced, at some point by another instigating post modeled after "b," or
else sidetracked by a post of "a" type, at any moment.


5. The Listserv's Structuring Taboo

a. All initiating posts, indeed one might even say all listserv members,
secretly aspire to enact the taboo form of expession. The flame is the
master-mover / -motivator of the list, it is vagueness distilled as sheer
force. Every post, particularly an instigating one, is strictly prohibited
from ever actualizing in its true form: the flame.


6. A Pure Credit Economy of the Prolix Word

a. The listserv operates as a pure credit economy. There are no debts to
"great" language (i.e. condensed word-power, words charged with the utmost
meaning). Nor is there any debt to the past. The list, and every post on it,
operates on credit of the latest present-tense post, and everyone has credit
to give to a vague future. Articulation remains in a future tense that never
arrives. This is an inarticulate credit economy of the word. No confidence
principle is required, for no one is ever duped.  Empty promises and forged
chits are no different from genuine promises and real chits. In the end, no
word is ever "cashed in."

I tried accessing the URL for Fake Langpo and was unsuccessful. But I do
want to suggest a different title for this site. How about Failed Langpo?
The idea of fake lanpo reminds me of those spin art booths that proved "even
a monkey" could make abstact paintings. As for nonsense in writing I think
Susan Stewart's book on this topic is very useful.

I've also wondered why language poetry challenged readers so frequently
focus on "the theory." Is this because it is harder to imagine a spin art
gadget to write it? It isn't that hard. Just make a grid of words frequently
used in theoretical texts and start connecting them at random and go from
there. It's easy. Anybody can do it!

Well, I was being slightly ironic -- I know a little about it (though mostly
as a result consciously learning about it when I began to lurk on some
American lists).  And I've written on Anne "Narapro" Waldman's contribution
to _100 Days_, so I do have some idea of the [geographical] distance between
Boulder and Buffalo and New York.

It was a +joke+.

But I'm the first to admit that my knowledge of contemporary American poetry
is pretty scrappy.  And equally, that my initial interest in Buffalo
Poetrics was a reflex of a fascination with lists-dynamics (and, more
specifically, with Kent Johnson).  Having been there in the Last Days of
subsub, and suffered through two -- hm ... what's a neutral word here? --
'incidents' -- on british-poets and poetryetc ...

I came to the conclusion that list-dynamics can best be understood in terms
of Primate territoriality.  The noyau structure and the "dear enemy"
phenomeon spring to mind.

> Unless Robin can answer to where he is coming from (I mean literary-wise),

Well (and here the problem may be Which Side of the Pond? yet again) -- I'm
pretty specifically coming out of a group of Glasgow writers there in the
mid-sities and early seventies.  I trailed a kalashnikov in The Glasgow
Language Wars myself, when we were trying desperately (and ultimately
successfully) to carve a niche for urban dialect writing.  (And this may be
part of the trouble I originally had getting my head round L+A+N+G+U+A+G+E
poetry, as something specifically related to Charles Bernstein and Buffalo
and that ilk.  There are various kinds of poetry in Britain that could be
loosely described as "language poetry", from J.H.Prynne at Cambridge to the
various writers in London who group around Bob Cobbing, but none quite like
the Buffalo version.)

> and who he is speaking for (he seems to speak for more than himself),
> there's just no point in addressing him directly.

Well, I'm speaking for myself, really, but out of a context where I'm not
unique in my relative ignorance.  When I tried to initiate a discusion on
poetryetc over _100 Days_  (and this despite -- or perhaps +because+ of the
presence of various English members of that list in that collection), it
ended up pretty much dead-in-the-water.  Nobody really seemed to want to
bother.

Well, again there's a problem of perspective here.  Palgrave had a strong
and invidious effect on English poetry from 1861 till the mid-sixties of the
last century.  It was still used as a teaching text when I was in highschool
then.  It enforced Tennyson's taste (and a prediliction for Short Lyric
Poetry), so over here, it was neither neutral nor innocuous.

Then it finally +did+ vanish, only to re-surface thirty years later as one
of the classic examples of canon formation.  So I have this interrupted
parabola where I began life cutting my teeth as a schoolchild on Poems From
Palgrave, and ended up teaching the bloody thing from Christopher Ricks'
excellent Penguin edition.

Palgrave is one of the line of Anthologies with Attitude -- Tottel's
Miscellany at one end, Yeats and Michael Roberts and Alvarez' _The New
Poetry_ and on and on forever at the other.  _Understanding Poetry_ by
Brooks and Warren and as an American example?  _Rebel Angels_ by Dana Gioia
and the Neoformalists as another American example?

Norton is quite different, and not +just+ because it was constructed
specifically as a teaching text.  The neat thing about Norton (and I'm
referring now to the 4th Ed. of _An Anthology of Poetry_ and not the
HistEngLit double-volume, or World Lit in its latest incarnation) was neat
simply because it gave you more poems for your dollars.  Bit like a plate of
porridge, but it was decently cooked porridge  Well, the first 3/4 -- lets
not start on how it might have managed to give the impression to an entire
generation of American Undergraduates that the major contemporary English
poets were Stevie Smith and Geoffrey Hill -- frankly, I can live with that.

But I could recommend it with a (relatively) clear conscience -- didn't
bankrupt the kids I was teaching, and it worked up to Year Two.

> Maybe I should have said that LP has become a Palgrave's *in our hands*,
to
> be clearer,

I don't go with this -- I really +can't+ see (and this may simply be my
ignorance) that LangPo could or will achieve the kind of (dangerous)
dominance that, for better or worse, Palgrave had over here.

But this partly turns on poets-in-academe.  Poetry in America (to venture
one of those sooper-dooper pooper snooper generalisations) is by now
thoroughly institutionalised.  It's not that probably too many British poets
are involved in university teaching, but that most here are paid-up
academics.  The MFA route doesn't exist.  And there's a price to pay on
this -- starts when you're an undergraduate and doesn't end till you retire.
<sigh>  It's virtually impossible (there are exceptions -- Empson and
Geoffry Hill and Tom Paulin) for a serious poet here to be +both+ a
successful academic AND a poet -- generally, life's too short for both
activities.  So you pay at the gate.  And keep on paying.

Sure -- I wouldn't quarrel AT ALL with this.  Anthologies are loaded and
dangerous.  But they're cheap, and can make a starting point.  Most of the
kids I was teaching weren't poets, so it would be unfair to make them go buy
individual volumes (at £6 a time each) of the 15 poets I felt they ought to
know. Sure, if you're serious about poetry, you'll happily starve for a day
to get the book you want.  But that isn't where (for most) it's at.

> So
> that in fact I see your interest in the slam poetry scene

Um ... We've just hit one of those countries-separated-by-a-common-tongue
things.  Slam poetry (from 3,000 miles away) is about as alien to me as
LangPo and Neoformalism.  (As I [mis]understand it, it was generated a
rather peculiar encounter between rap and poetry.  There +might+ be things
comparable here to slam poetry [mostly in London and mostly round poets like
Lynton Kwasi Johnson], but my natural association would be with The Great
Albert Hall Poetry Incarnations of the sixties (and which -- here -- were
dead in the water by the seventies).

Well, no, I have to disagree here -- Ardry was simplified rather than a
populariser, there's a difference.  His research [well, reporting of other
people's research], for the time he was publishing, was actually pretty
good.  And isn't the "naked ape" Desmond Morris rather than Ardry? And
"noyau" has a pretty specific meaning (post-Ardry) in terms of Primate
territoriality.  As to the "dear enemy" phenomon (K, I was cheating a
little) this is normally discussed in terms of avian territoriality rather
than primate.

But I wouldn't go to the stake for him -- I'd entirely agree that his work
was both loaded and of-its-time.  But he actually does write rather well.
And (for me) provides some rather insightful images for the behaviour of
lists

When I started on this, I was thinking much more of some of the academic
lists (e.g. Milton-L) in terms of noyau.  But it all fell through.  Partly
just +because+ you can't analyse poetry lists in these terms.  BufPo (which
makes it relatively sophisticated) possibly correlates with a gorilla pack.
subsub by the end had dropped below the horizon and presented the spectacle
to a Baffled Outsider of a bunch of pirhanna fish in a barrel.

When I'm not reading The Guardian.

i wondered about that: nonsense vs planned so
carefully. susan howe's rapturous and wierd lyrics:
governed so carefully at the syllabic level by
sound--or the length and number of stanzas in "my
life" so carefully plotted. but within that careful
framework the form of cognitive release.

a chance to really explore mad ideas without
provenance. some interview asked s howe how she
generates the ideas for her books and
she--incredulous--says she *never* starts with an
idea, *only* with the language and the sounds and the
individual scraps of words.

so how is that "poetry governed by theory"

i'm also a bit confused that language poetry is
supposed to be "not fun to read"

i ran through "my life" like a comic book. is that a
bad example? anyways most of my favorite poems from
this direction of the universe are gorgeous pieces of
writing and sonically electric. Read the second part
of "Articulation of Sound Forms..." (from
Singularities) out loud. it's complete music.

what i mean is: (yay BUNCH of KOOKS): poetry as a form
of madness. real kooks. not chance operations or "wild
looking but so carefully written" but
go-stark-raving-mad. Joris' "Winnetou Old" for example
or Olga Broumas' "Sappho's Gymnasium"

i haven't read that Susan Stewart book but can you
send  me title info, etc.?

re the spin art machine: you all listened to Yoko
Ono's album "Fly"? the second disc (a two-album set,
such a Yoko-bargain) is comprised of songs created by
automatic machines (chance operations in music)
operated only by (Yoko's words) "turning levers or
pushing buttons" of course accompanied by "the wail."

i think the obsession of equating language poetry with
"theory" was just an extravagant form of
marginalization.

and "language poetry" maybe just got called that
recently but the lineage has been there (being
suppressed of course) all along and isn't only
american.

"failed langpo" might be a better tag; because to me
"failure" is the beginning of poetry. right? you jump
at the bar and fall? or something like that--

Poulin's 'Contemporary American Poetry' anthology (Houghton Mifflin)
supplies a photo for every author represented.  The 2-page preface might
make an interesting secondary text.  Specifically about photos he writes
'I trust readers will agree that the full-page photographs of the poets
add a personal and human dimension too often lacking in anthologies, and I
want to thank the photographers for supplying so many stunning
photographs.'  He also provides a photo of himself, though, as the single
exception to the rule of the book, he is depicted with family members.
I've always felt the images to add a rather haunting dimension to the
collection -- the full page head shots brood over the subsequent poems,
bearing down on them like headstones in an ancestral vault.

the one full-body shot in the Poulin anthology was
Charles Olson sitting on a stoop with an umbrella or a
can or something like that.

of course he and Robert Duncan have been dropped out
of the current edition ostensibly due to time lapsed
since their deaths though Richard Hugo, James Wright,
and David Ignatow remain represented.

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS:
Deadline: June 15th, 2002

NEW TRANSLATION: THE JOURNAL OF LITERARY TRANSLATION

It is my pleasure to announce the return of Translation to
publication, as New Translation, beginning with a first issue
scheduled to appear in September 2002. Translation, the Journal of
Literary Translation, enjoyed a distinguished run from its inception
in 1970 until 1994. During that time, it introduced English language
readers to hundreds of writers representing scores of languages
around the globe, and served an important role in enlarging the
vision of our sometimes linguistically parochial culture.

A modest change in the journal's name seemed fitting given the lapse
of time since the journal last appeared and since its reappearance
occurs under new editorial hands. It is my hope, also, that the "new"
indicates a vigorous commitment to bringing to the attention of our
readers writers who have been little or not at all heard from in
English, and to advocating the riches of literatures that have gone
under-appreciated and under-represented in translation. New
Translation will thus serve additionally to complement the
tremendous rise of postcolonial studies -- a rise which has drawn
attention to problems of globalization, to "minor" literatures (in
Deleuze's sense), and inevitably to issues of translation and
cultural exchange.

It is my further hope that the "new" will speak to a commitment to
develop in the pages of the journal a forum for addressing and
exploring the frontiers of the art of translation in theory as well
as practice. We live in a time when the artistic abundance beyond our
linguistic border is staggering. We live, too, in a time
when the catastrophic consequences of ignorance or intolerance of
what is outside our cultural orbit must be painfully apparent to
all of us. I believe that New Translation has an important role to
play in helping us to enjoy that abundance and to absolve us of that
ignorance.

The editors of New Translation are pleased to acknowledge the generous
financial support of the Thornton Wilder Foundation and the general
support of the School of the Arts at Columbia University. We are
presently accepting manuscripts for the first two issues of the
journal of translations into English from all other languages, living
and not, in all genres, including but hardly limited to poetry,
fiction, theatre, essay, and criticism. We also welcome original work
which concerns the practice, history or art (or science) of
translation, including discussions of translation as it obtains to
such matters beyond the immediately literary as music, film and
our often logocentric visual arts. Manuscripts should be received no
later than June 15, 2002 for consideration for the September issue.
Authors are promised a response to submissions within six weeks of
receipt of their manuscripts. Original language texts are welcome to
accompany submissions, but not required. Submissions may be
sent either as manuscripts to the address below, or electronically to
newtranslation@columbia.edu (preferably as an MS/Word attachment).
Inquiries can also be made to my attention at rjm49@columbia.edu.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Criticism happens after the fact.  It requires artifacts.  It is
retrospective.

Perhaps there is a kind of criticism that will help the new poem to get
written.  Pound and Eliot tried to write that kind.  It is not to be found
in today's academic journals.  Non-academic journals, maybe.

If you are a writer, you must be very careful not to waste your labors.
That is the key thing: not to waste your time.  Too much time gets spent
re-inventing the wheel, or feeling shitty, as it is.  Vita brevis.

Why should you try to "read everything"?  You do not even have time for the
classics.  Learn another language instead.  Read whatever is going to
enable you to write the new poem.  That's what the rest of us are waiting
for.

The lesson of Language writing is the importance of community.  Things move
along more quickly that way.  Literature is driven by interesting remarks,
not arguments.  Hence the theoretical usefulness of listservs.

Indeed, arguments are almost beside the point.  I don't believe that
Charles Bernstein, for example, has ever _persuaded_ anyone of anything.
No one has ever read one of his books and then, after dispassionate
reflection, said, "My God, he's right.  Poetry must be restored to the
participatory control of its users.  I see now how naive I was to like
Frank Bidart."  CB has impact because -- occasionally -- he puts an idea
memorably.  I don't know what else one can do.

Penultimate pronunciamento:

What we want, or should want, is that a contribution be made to
civilization.  Each generation must add something.  The generation that
fails to contribute dies without having understood itself, its moment in
history.  It has wasted its time in ignorance.

Final flourish (aren't you relieved):

Poets who accommodate themselves to the academy thereby diminish the idea
of what it means to be a poet.  They diminish an old idea of greatness.
Now, accommodation is not exactly the same thing as accepting a job.  And
some will say that this idea of poetic greatness is one we can do without
(they call it "the myth of genius").  Furthermore, nearly every
distinguished poet over the age of 35 is connected in some way to the
academy, and the rest seem headed that way.  We know why.  Bernstein again:
"it's like a living death  going to work / every day  sort of like being in
a tomb..."

But the old idea of the poet stands.  There is still the high road of art.

I am pleased to announce significant new resources at the Electronic Poetry
Center including: Lorine Niedecker Author Page, Paul Hoover Author Page,
and the Maxine Chernoff Author Page. Greatly expanded: Andrew Levy Author
Page and Hannah Weiner Author Page, including an html and PDF of her
Weiner's published book of poetry, _The Magritte Poems_. You will find
significant resources in these page, including many resources available for
the first time on the Web -- original work, essays, and sound. Special
thanks to Patrick F. Durgin, who has skillfully overseen the implementation
of these pages, with the assistance of Jenny Penberthy (Niedecker) and
Jerrold Shiroma (Hoover, Chernoff). These resources are available from the
EPC Home Page:

http://epc.buffalo.edu/

under "New" and "Authors". Grateful thanks to Patrick, Jenny, and Jerrold
for their help with these important resources.

Keep tuned: significant additional new EPC resources will soon be announced!

Oh, c'mon, Lawrence. No one's accusing you of being an intellectual. Your
position that in order to contradict your views one must define each and
every word they use is a classic example of using language to silence
opposition.

The Way of The Cavalier is to pull our revealing
pantaloons up about our hips and cincture them, so
that our weighty Pendulums do not chafe upon the
flagstones, to be unmanned in a doily shoppe.

Time is as a small cake whose every crumb must be
gummed or pinched.

I play the music of Lully, 1632 - 1687, not of Racine,
1639- 1699, in the background on my useful headphones,
so as to be A Constructive Fellow, not a niggler,
making utility of every scrumptuous moment (by
exercising!) and to have a well-paced marching rhythm
that guides my mincing Nancy steps toward elevated
ground.

Criticism, that old she-hag of gender who waits to
syphon out sweet plump young poetry's fair lustrous
bloom.  Ha!  It is for those whose time is a nasty
wastefulness, as a waste of corruption in their pants
whereon they sit.  She shows up too late at the
christening and drinks the water from the font to
taste the infant.

Poetry must fuel herself with a good mastication of
hardy foods.

You are in a "romantic relationship" with a
"significant other."  You go to poetry-inspiring
movies.  You watch the sickle of television.  How
could that employment leave time for the grey shadows
of impolite thinkers whose impositions are a waste
that no clean cloth can cleanse?  Then scrub the waste
away!  You have no time nor space!  (Time, the stern
master.)  Latin epigrams are bearing down upon you,
though not wastefully!

I am responsive only to aphorisms.  Aphorisms win.

What is an "argument"?  Ha!  It starts with an "are
gew" and it ends with "meant"!  It is as a snare or a
fowler's trap to tangle our shins around a pot of
waste.

Stuff your great poetry stomach with nutritious boiled
reading material that can have Utilitarian Value, my
waster!  not with the she-hag's indolence and
uselessness.

For example: Charles Bernstein.  He wears glasses.  So
then why ~drink~ from glass when he, an example,
places glass before his eyes as a better entrance into
the high life!  The top shelf!  High, yes, that
interests everyone too short to reach easily.
Ascend!  Rise, as something tumesced!  Who has ever
met a Bernstein and said, That man is my lookalike!
His imposter?  His physiognomy, his phrenology, his
aftertaste, they leave no bitter wastefulness upon the
palate.  It is as a fresh lemony Bernstein that has no
unpleasant waste matter, ah.   No one has ever
followed him into heinous unlawfulness of anarchy or
said, There's a fine reason to save my every pretty
precious minute in a pail, a party favor!  Without
waste!  A fob watch, there's a treasury to stuff in
your pocket, not to squander hours in bug-eyed
bookishness.  Look to the Kings of Poetry!  What,
gossip?

Every baby must give its waste to a nursemaid or it is
as a thing to be placed in the corner and dessicated.
Or else, let them be as do-nothings and dummies, who
have no special senses.

Some befoul their swollen pectorals.  They take a
wreath and they make it as poop.  Who would ever work?
 A slave!   More Bernstein: "Maria!  Maria!  I just
met a girl named Maria"!

Everyone should go Upstairs and avoid basements.  And
let no waste dog your heel, as a discoloration.

I give you this from how Pound and Eliot used four
minutes, as a pie.

I have appeared as an author on the back of cover of someone elses book
because this person thot I was more photogenic, less grey hair (PS
not only did I get funded today, ((I will buy finger
rings in gold!!!  IMFU   NDED)  I got a corporate
hair sponsor (Eddie Spaghetti was in town
last night), please advise, has anyone else who is
literary had one of these? If I have a bad hair day
will they cap me?), think big prize, anyway for that
I had medium length hair(back of neck), sitting down,
goofy ass smile.

On my recent book, sitting down,
shot on a zoom lense by my friend Toledo on an overhead crane cam,
long hair, eat poop smile, easy to see my broken nose.Please
excuse my lack of interest in socialist morality & justice,
this is the marxist rendered answer
to the exploitative economic force
behind the questions being asked by many.
Chris do not give away your verse for free for once.

"A creator who creates, who is not an academician, who is not some one who
studies in a school where the rules are already known, and of course being
known they no longer exist, a creator then who creates is necessarily of his
generation. His generation lives in its contemporary way but they only live
in it. In art, in literature, in the theatre, in short in everything that

tramcars can no longer exist but horses and tramcars are only suppressed only
when they cause too many complications, they are suppressed but sixty years
too late. Lord Grey said when the war broke out that the generals thought of
a war of the nineteenth century even when the instruments of war were of the
twentieth century and only when the war was at its height did the generals
understand that it was a war of the twentieth century and not a war of the
nineteenth century. That is what the academic spirit is, it is not
contemporary, of course not, and so it can not be creative because the only
thing that is creative in a creator is the contemporary thing. Of course."

Should poets ignore academic criticism? No. Nor is it likely that they could.
Should poets read academic criticism? Maybe.
Do poets _need_ academic criticism? Up to a point perhaps. But no, they do
not _need_ it, unless of course they are interested in writing academic
criticism, of which _Picasso_ is not an example.

That, that poets do not need academic criticism, is what I take to be the
thrust of Andrew Rathmann's 'rant', as it has been called. What poets need,
on the other hand, is a very important question. One thing we need is a way
to make a living in a world that has no use for us. Becoming an academic is
one way to do that. But there should be other ways. What we need is a
MONEY-MAKING MACHINE, not to get rich but just to survive. Like the Girl
Scouts, you know, and their cookies. Or at my grade school where we raised
money by selling trash bags. Not everybody needs everybody's book of poems
but everybody needs a solid trash bag. One thing I'd been thinking about
trying to patent is EDIBLE TAPE. Something you could use to keep a burrito
from falling apart. Wraps are a big hit these days, or you could eat it
because the tape tastes good. It could be full of vitamins and ginseng and
have poems printed on it. Edible tape, think about it, fellas.

Williams said he became a doctor so he could do as he damned well pleased.
That's not the academic spirit, that's something else. Maybe too
'entrepreneurial'? Who knows. I need to take a shower.

Early Pound with his bouffant and/or long straight moustache (cover of
Selected Prose), and sinister look. Also looks good in a beret.

Williams in flowers, smiling on cover of his Selected Poems. His intense
photo on cover of Imaginations and the one where he's like 70 sitting at his
desk with a copy of Desert Music and a crazy look in his eye.

Most Kerouac photos, like the one where he's walking by whoever took the
photo and opening his mouth wide. The one where he's got a suitcase in his
hand full of all his writing, standing near a car. Also, the one where he and
Burroughs are play-fighting with a big kitchen knife.

Wilde's photos after he arrived in New York. Long, wavy hair and an air of
passionate detachment. Nice stockings.

Whitman without hat, probably in his 40s. Short beard and close-cropped hair.
Looking innocent and lovely as hell.

Any photo of Loy, naked from behind, or with cigarrette.

Mayakovsky's movie star photos. That was one sexy motherfucker.

O'Hara in his white robe looking like a god, days before his death I believe.

Spicer kissing bust of himself (cover of Poet Be Like God) and university
photo of him taken when he was in Minnesota. Dark, gentle look on face.

Lorca's on cover of In Search of Duende. And in white suit arriving in
Havana. Also happy photo when arriving in Buenos Aires (they love him!). Him
and Dali in swimsuits, too.

Stein in bird bath.

Baudelaire photo taken by Etienne Carjat. He's holding a cane (that's what I
need -- a cane!) with left hand. Big black coat and bow tie. A tinge of
spiritual arrogance on his face.

Stevens as an altar boy.

Melville on the cover of Call Me Ishmael. You can see the entire ocean in
that beard. Ancient, ancient.

Frank Stanford in karate get-up.

Marinetti in car (and with cigar I believe).

Berrigan on the cover of Ted.

Rilke where he's peering a million miles past you, into your soul.

Thoreau where looked like he just woke up. Hair all uncombed. Sleepy-lidded.

Nada Gordon on the cover of Foreign Bodie.

Joanne Kyger under Buddha.

Chris Stroffolino on the back of Oops, looking spent. A little chest hair for
the ladies.

Jeff Clark in bath tub, at his website. Crazy hair, trumping Pound's doo.
Nice chest hair, too.

Jeffrey Jullich at the How2 site. Speechless.

Me at How2 site. Taken during one of my bar article assignments. Makes me
look luckier and better-dressed than I am.

>> the only thing that is creative in a creator is the contemporary
thing.


        David,=20

        I must disagree, the creator in your sense is a static
sentiment. A creation brings forth the moment and all moments after. Yes
there is a negative connotation associated with pre-creation, but never
mind that for now. To create is not to innovate, rather the moderns said
'make it new'. So when mom created me she wasn't hoping for a new
species, but a unique set within a given form. So when one makes from
nothing there are concerns of what came before, is being created today,
and how that creation manifests into other forms. It=92s the circle of
life like what that Elton John guy sings about. So to dwell on only one
aspect of the cyclical nature of creation and destruction is nullifying
the environment with in which is exists.=20

        Best, Geoffrey=20

too late. Lord Grey said when the war broke out that the generals
thought of
a war of the nineteenth century even when the instruments of war were of
the
twentieth century and only when the war was at its height did the
generals
understand that it was a war of the twentieth century and not a war of
the
nineteenth century. That is what the academic spirit is, it is not
contemporary, of course not, and so it can not be creative because the
only
thing that is creative in a creator is the contemporary thing. Of
course."

-- from _Picasso_ by Gertrude Stein


Should poets ignore academic criticism? No. Nor is it likely that they
could.
Should poets read academic criticism? Maybe.
Do poets _need_ academic criticism? Up to a point perhaps. But no, they
do
not _need_ it, unless of course they are interested in writing academic
criticism, of which _Picasso_ is not an example.

That, that poets do not need academic criticism, is what I take to be
the
thrust of Andrew Rathmann's 'rant', as it has been called. What poets
need,
on the other hand, is a very important question. One thing we need is a
way
to make a living in a world that has no use for us. Becoming an academic
is
one way to do that. But there should be other ways. What we need is a
MONEY-MAKING MACHINE, not to get rich but just to survive. Like the Girl
Scouts, you know, and their cookies. Or at my grade school where we
raised
money by selling trash bags. Not everybody needs everybody's book of
poems
but everybody needs a solid trash bag. One thing I'd been thinking about
trying to patent is EDIBLE TAPE. Something you could use to keep a
burrito
from falling apart. Wraps are a big hit these days, or you could eat it
because the tape tastes good. It could be full of vitamins and ginseng
and
have poems printed on it. Edible tape, think about it, fellas.

Williams said he became a doctor so he could do as he damned well
pleased.
That's not the academic spirit, that's something else. Maybe too
'entrepreneurial'? Who knows. I need to take a shower.

in honor of refuseniks everywhere, and as a byproduct of an unrelated
experiment, I've uploaded three exceptionally large pdf files
comprising the entire first volume of the forties pacifist
newsletter, Pacifica Views. Obviously, this isn't for everyone, but
there are one or two people on this list who might find this a useful
resource. I'd bet versions of it are in most university libraries,
but probably not as much outside of the usa.  it provides an
interesting window into the lives and ideas of cps campers, recently
featured in a pbs documentary.

sorry, but the file sizes are exceptionally large (about 30, 16 and
12 megs  respectively) -- like I said, it's part of an experiment -
and while I'd like to correct this rather obvious mistake, that may
take some time. I should have broken it into smaller chunks, and
there are reasons why the dimensions are as large as they are. In any
case, it's at a significantly higher resolution than it needs to be,
so at least it will print well.  If there is an interest, I'll upload
smaller versions as time permits.

For those of you who want to down load the pdfs, you should "save to
disk" since they won't load through a browser at that size. And they
probably won't work over a modem, so sorry again for that.

I'll keep them available for a week or two, then delete them. If
you'd like more info, please backchannel me.

SARAH MANGOLD & FRED MOTEN

Winner of the 2001 New Issues Poetry Prize, Sarah Mangold’s first book
Household Mechanics is, "... a disquieting review of indirect disclosures,
internal churnings, and palpable notions, subjected to a tense and
skeletal language" (C.D. Wright). Born in Omaha, Nebraska and raised in
Oklahoma, Mangold studied at San Francisco State. She is also the author
of a chapbook, Blood Substitutes (Potes & Poets, 1998), and the editor of
the Seattle-based magazine Bird Dog.
An investigator of geography and language, Fred Moten is the author of the
poetry collection Arkansas (Pressed Wafer, 2000), which, as Michael Palmer
says, "...reminds us that no vital sense of community can be separated
from its confusions and contentions and its ardent affirmations, just as
no poetry of worth can settle for the easy assuagements of the given."
Moten teaches in the Department of Performance Studies at the Tisch School
of the Arts, NYU. His next book, Ensemble & Improvisation: The Political
Erotics of the Black Avant-Garde, is due out from the University of
Minnesota Press.

Kafka's _Trial_, of course. Dostoevsky's _The Karamazov Brothers_ (it's =

  "Instruments of Uselessness"
A Talk by Diana George & Nic Veroli
Sunday May 19 at 2pm FREE
at the Kootenay School of Writing
201 - 505 Hamilton Street, Vancouver
604-688-6001

"We're interested in uselessness and desertion as affirmative, joyful
practices. We start by raising some questions about the primacy of
negation and the dead ends into which it has led thought (practice).
With desertion what we want to desert above all is self-sacrifice: the
striker who sacrifices herself for the future. Deferred gratification is
the contamination of time by the negative; working (or striking) becomes
waiting, boredom, death. Desertion without privation, desertion without
sacrifice, these are the only desertions worthy of the name."

Diana George's essays have appeared in Nest and in Seattle's Arcade. Her
fiction has appeared, or is forthcoming, in 3rd Bed, Alt-x.com, and Post
Road. She is translating a selection from Alexander Kluge and Oskar
Negt's Geschichte und Eigensinn.

Nicolas Veroli is a freelance writer living in Seattle. He is currently
an adjunct professor in Seattle University's philosophy department and
Global African Studies Program. He is revising for publication a
manuscript entitled Imagination and Politics: A Study in Historical
Ontology, and researching a project on mass movements, democracy, and
the communication of affect. Nic works in Seattle CISPES, the Committee
in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador.

Collaboratively, Veroli & George are the authors of "Manifesto for a
Politics Without the State" and "What If They Gave a Depression and
Nobody Came?" published in the 1st issue of Politics Without the State,
on Joy, Terror and Depression in the Global Order (Seattle Research
Institute, January 2002). A limited number of copies of the book will be
available at the talk. Visit SRI on-line at
<http://www.seattleresearchinstitute.org> for additional info.

A new exhibition catalogue, small dead woman / Last Seen, by Kevin
Yates, Diana George and Charles Mudede (Artspeak, 2002) will also be
launched at the event. Artspeak is online at <http://www.artspeak.bc.ca> .

Excerpt from "Of Joy and Terror in the Global Corporate Order" by
Nicolas Veroli from Politics Without the State #1 :

Control the imagination and you will control desire: this is the lesson
that pioneers of public relations and advertisement such as Walter
Lippmannn learned over 80 years ago and which their descendants have
been putting into action with ever greater sophistication since then. Of
course, this imperative articulates or reveals the perspective of the
rulers, the perspective of the Prince as the Italian political
philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli would have called it, or that of the
philosopher-kings as Plato said with somewhat less irony much longer
ago. In short, this is the point of view of the elites or of the ruling
class as we might be wont to put it today, and so of significantly less
value to those of us who are not part of that class than to those who
are. For those of us who are "the ruled" in this situation - and by
"this situation" I mean late capitalism - that is to say, for those of
us whose imaginations and desires are objects of control, this
perspective only yields one utterly unacceptable consequence: abject
submission.

But that is not the only problem with the rulers' motto. It also makes
certain assumptions that it is unnecessary for us to make, assumptions
that, in fact, are questionable. For instance, it assumes that one can
stand in a relation of pure instrumentality to the imagination, that
some people can manipulate other peoples' imagination in the same way
that, say, a soldier can fire a gun or that a carpenter uses a hammer.
But that's simply not the case. Consider the following hypothetical
situation: an advertising professional is assigned the task of coming up
with the idea of a campaign for one more useless soap product. His
problem is that there is nothing genuinely new about this particular
brand of soap. So what can he sell it on? The idea he comes up with is
simple: it's to call the soap "antibacterial," and to equate dirt w with
bacteria and disease and death in a massive nationwide ad campaign.
"Only this brand of soap will save you from dreaded bacteria," and so
on. The brand of soap itself eventually disappears into the sweet
oblivion of time but the equation "dirt=death" stays and, in fact, gains
popularity. So much so, in fact, that 20 or 30 years later our aging
advertising exec has started taking a shower once a day and uses soap
every time, instead of doing it once or twice a week--on the advice of
his doctor. When as for his teenage daughter she showers in the morning,
bathes at night, and changes outfits at least five times a day. Of
course, there is also the quite real case of Hearst, the California
newspaper conglomerate owner who had to throw away his shirt at the end
of each day because it was "soiled." Thus, while it's true to say that
elites attain some of what they want through advertising and other media
technologies, it is also true that they themselves are not immune from
the symbolic order and the processes of its imaginary institution they
are trying to manipulate.

In fact, the imagination is shared: it is an intrinsic aspect of the
socius, of what binds together societies, cultures, nations,
civilizations, what have you. It is neither an object of bare
manipulation nor a mental faculty that can be exercised or left to
languish. Indeed, it cannot be the latter since it is the imagination
from which self-identity emerges; it is prior to one's self-designation
as an individual. The imagination is the pre-psychological anonymous
stratum of activity out of which subjects and objects (and many other
things besides) emerge. It belongs to no one, which is to say that it
belongs to everyone: the imagination is a commons. Its legal alienation
into forms of private property (intellectual property laws, the
commodification of symbols through corporate branding, and so on) is
simply a convenient fiction meant to facilitate the accumulation of
capital. Fundamentally, though, it is resilient to all forms of
hierarchy precisely because it escapes full instrumentalization . Its
manipulation always has repercussions for the apprentice sorcerer as
well as for those upon whom he or she casts a spell. And I'm not simply
talking about the fact that the rich get sick from their own propaganda,
but that these experiments cause greater and greater resistance to occur
on their own terms, that is to say on the level of the imagination
itself and of desire, on what one might call a " biopolitical" level.

This is a hard question when it comes to poetry, but in fiction there's a
lot. If by 'main theme' you mean 'climactic scene', then these might be of
use-- (besides Kafka)


  Richard Wright _Native Son_

  Harper Lee _To Kill a Mockingbird_

  Charles Dickens _Bleak House_ (well, the whole book revolves around the
court system, and there are some courtroom scenes, and the main problem is
the settlement of a will, which is not exactly a 'trial' but does involve
jurisprudence)

  John Grisham _The Runaway Jury_  (and others)

Kafka's _Trial_, of course. Dostoevsky's _The Karamazov Brothers_ (it's one
*one* of the big themes there). Tolstoy's _Resurrection_ (ditto).

Dear Kari

One of my all-time favorites which I re-read every year is THE BELLAMY TRIAL by Frances Noyes Hart (it's from the 1920s).=
  If you can't find it let me know I'll lend you my copy.  It's a novel.

Two others I loved as a teen boy were THE PAPER DRAGON by Evan Hunter and THE SEVEN MINUTES by Irving Wallace.  (The latt=
er became a film by Russ Meyer, not one of his best.)  (And neither of these novels is a hundredth part as good as THE BE=
LLAMY TRIAL.)

Love
Kevin

Fellow poets,

I am currently engaged in a research project concerned with tracking the
interactions between American poets and the peace movement; how poets worked
in activism and through symbolic actions (poetry and other language-actions)
in resisting war and forging a vision of peace.

Background
(I wrote my dissertation on American poets and war resistance from 1940 to the
present; some of the people who figured prominently were: Robert Lowell,
William Stafford, Jackson Mac Low, and William Everson (WWII); Denise
Levertov, Allen Ginsberg, Daniel Berrigan, Robert Bly and John Balaban (among
others during the Vietnam War era); and more recent living poets including
June Jordan, Barrett Watten, and others (Persian Gulf War)--many mainstream
poets, some experimental--but all participating in the project of war
resistance.

The Call
In particular, I am asking for poems that were written on/during/ the Persian
Gulf War and a short prose commentary (from the sender) regarding how those
poems/symbolic actions/language events were implemented as part of war
resistance.  I am interested in details regarding public spheres in which
these pieces were occurring, the response to them, and reflections on the
efficacy of such actions against other modes of "political activism."  These
will form, at the very least, a mini-archive of possible poetry actions for
the future (perhaps to be published online, perhaps on paper--to be
determined).

I thank you in advance for your poems/commentaries.  If there are other lists
that may also have poets interested in participating, feel free to let me know
or post this message directly to them.  Please send your poems offlist to me,
Phil Metres at pmetres@jcu.edu

kari,

In addition to Kafka's _The Trial_, already mentioned

there is "Authorities (A Lecture)" by Jena Osman, from her book _The

I don't know how much this applies, but Lenny Bruce has a piece about going
to court for swearing during one of his performances.  Could be construed as
stand up comedy, or poetry.  It is in a four cd set called howls, raps and
roars alongside a great version of Ginsberg reading Howl, Michael McClure
growling, and some jazzy Jack Kerouack haikus.

Neither fiction nor poetry, but how about the trial of Anne Hutchinson by
the clerics and governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.  See "transcript"

Semantics -- Strike!

The colloquial derivation for "argument" (from arguere, to prove) is "Argh!
You meant... [e.g. to say X]," while, conversely, the colloquial derivation
for "remark" (again : mark) is "I really mean it." For examples. Your hair
looks great today. I really mean it.... Argh! You meant: That the Self
Larger than the Idea of Self is like a Remark Larger than its Argument --
the Affects of their (hidden) Effects. A listserv parable! Precisely -- a
remark that argues: argument that remarks. (Derivations valid only for
western southern-Canada and the northwestern U.S. and only while on
Stroffolino's car lasts; for other regions, consult Barrett Watten
immediately -- if they persist press icily on the brains of the living,
contact nearest colloquial-derivationist.)

Karen. There are so many messages. I missed this. I havent read a lot of
Joris but believe she is a good poet. Its easy to criticisize: the point is
to be a doer. I think I've gt that book "The Dream..." I bought of of her
books new as one of my "hats" I'm a sort of collector but also I sell books
(Aspect Books on abebooks.com) (but that's not why i bought it..I used to
buy anything (Icould afford) here (NZ) that was poetry (especially
interesting) and I'd heard that Joaris was influenced somewhat by Ashbery
who is/was a big poet for me. Regards, Richard.

neat...now are there things like this in NYC (conferences that make pages
like this anomg other things)
I don't know how many of us there are in the nYC area but it would be nice
to have a webartery in person get togetehr some time, maybe to welcome home
Alan and Azure.  I knew fewer of you than many others, and I guess in person
I cant hide the fact that I have the figure of a bowling ball, but people in
non comoputer form can be nice even if it might degenerate into showing each
other thinsg on the computer.

If it's after June 12th, I can volunteer my living room...

Millie

P.S.  It would be nice to have to the young people (like me, but I'm
shameless) who are scared to post or think thaty have nothing to offer as
well as the established folk.

Am trying to decide whether to buy Flash MX.  My dough is running out and it
really will if I buy it.  So I need to code something in it, but my
envisioned Flash projects are not code-heavy, and I gather it is the dcoding
tat has chhnaged the most between versions.

My favourite Dickens book: the "Jarndyce and Jarndyce case"...the fog of
London fogging everything: hence the pettifogging and probably the
inspiration for Eliot's  "And the yellow smoke that rubs its nuzzle on the
window panes" and so on. Mind you I last read that in about 1968 (before
that as a boy): I believe also that Doctorow's "Daniel' like Coover's book
is hased on the Rosenberg trial. There's also a very funny trial in "The
Golden Ass" by Apuleuis.  What about "Animal Farm" ? Also in Malamud's book
"The Fixer" there's a kind of trial (reminiscent of Camus's book "The
Outsider"). What about "The Pied Piper of Hamlyn"? Even "Les Miserables".
There's a trial in "The Wind in the Willows" and in the Alice books there's
a strange sense that Alice is on trial: or is language, logic, and meaning
on trial? Everything is a trial: like is literature literature life and all
life is a trial, hence all literature is a trial. A very long trial: and
people trial off the subject, which is very trialing, trailing that
trial....... Richard.

No problem Richard, I know how crazy these list messages can get sometimes. I
have a question for you. Some time back I remember reading a posting
concerning a well known poet who eschewed the use of the word "the" in his
poems. Can you remember who that was they were talking about?

Lawyers feud in and out of the background over car accidents, copyright law

   Along the same lines, the actual transcripts of the Nuremberg trials.

 Or their fictional version, "Judgment at Nuremberg," made into a film with
Spencer Tracy.  And for a comical trial which is loaded with gender issues,
another Spencer Tracy movie, "Adams Rib."  The fictional version of the
Scopes trial, "Inherit the Wind."

Neither fiction nor poetry, but how about the trial of Anne Hutchinson by
the clerics and governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.  See "transcript"
(fraught with issues of translation and transcription) in Hall, ed. _The
Antinomian Controversy_.

Subject:      fiction anthologies
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

I'm looking for a fiction anthology that one could use for teaching
that would have some innovative or lively writing in it--not the same
people one sees over and over in fiction anthologies.  The main
criticism I've read about the Norton Postmodern fiction anthology was
it relied too heavily on excerpts, a valid criticism, I think.  An
ideal one would have a bit of conventional story and a bit of
postmodern whatever.  Does such a hybrid exist?  Or perhaps I'm
looking for two anthologies, a good conventional one and a more
out-there one?  I think I'm looking mostly for modern/contemporary
work.

Thanks.

Subject:      Devin Johnston's _Telepathy_ & other first books
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Those of us who know Devin, or who had dealings with him when he was with
the Chicago Review, have been waiting for his first book for some time.
Now it's out, and it definitely meets expectations (which were high).

You can see his influences -- Zukofsky's minimalism, Moore's syllabics,
also Duncan, Dorn, S. Howe, others --  but the total effect is quite
strange, moving, and original.  He rhymes.  He quotes Keats.  There are
Appalachian references, a poem about Phil Spector, a poem that engages
Shelley's Witch of Atlas.  It's quite something.

Telepathy is published by Paper Bark Press, in Sydney.

Has anyone else read it?  Some buzz on the list would be good...

---

It seems very important to discuss first books, and/or books by
(relatively) younger writers, as they come out.

Louis Cabri's _Mood Embosser_ for example.  I haven't received my copy yet,
but would be interested in hearing what others think.

Other titles?

There was a Beacon Press anthology that came out last
year edited by Junot Diaz I think that seemed fairly
eclectic--does anyone know the name of that one?

What a brilliant (sweet) connection between Malevich
and Palmer. Each of them makes a different kind of
sense to me now.

But then again I just have a pretty special place in
my heart for anyone who thinks Malevich is cool.

Here goes: the best place to order Tinfish books, aside from here with =
me, is through Native Books, in Honolulu.  Their website is =
www.nativebookshawaii.com/
and they carry almost all Tinfish products.  My contact there is Ron Cox =
(coxr@hawaii.edu), who is a wonderful person to deal with.

To see the products, try our (incomplete) website at:

http://maven.english.hawaii.edu/tinfish

You can also buy most of the chaps through amazon, though that would be =
my last choice, as they don't pay me much beyond a pittance.

thanks much,

Susan

any of the many accounts of the trial of joan of arc. there are some
really great french film treatments of the trial too. There is one (i
can't remember who directed it) where Joan was played by a renowned beauty
and it is said that when her head was shaved on camera, the crew wept.

i'll look into this as now that i'm thinking of it, it was a great film.

not sure if you folks are aware of the critical situation canadian small
presses are in at this very moment, but things are looking very grim:


this just in from alienated.net:

Things just got worse for the Canadian publishers who've been dealing
with General Distribution, and they could become worse yet.
Jack Stoddart says his General Publishing Co. Ltd. will collapse if Bank
of Nova Scotia doesn't give it another $3 million.
The bank, which is General's largest secured creditor, will provide the
financing only if Ontario Superior Court makes an "unequivocal"
declaration that past receivables of the company are the sole property
of General.
Translation: the bank will only help General to restructure if it keeps
all of the the money that it owes to the small presses.
The bank also wants Chapters/Indigo, which is 65% of General's business,
to pay its $1.4-million bill directly to General rather than to
publishers.
Of course, we publishers aren't all that impressed with either notion.
If Stoddart doesn't get his $3 million, General will probably declare
bankruptcy immediately, taking down our stock and receivables in the
process.
Today, publishers are in court to ask Mr. Justice John Ground to allow
them to get receivables as well as their inventory from General --
because we could go under.

Ground Works
Avant-Garde for Thee
Christian Bök
Introduction by Margaret Atwood

If sometime between the 1960s and 1980s Canadian society began unbuttoning
itself, our experimental writers helped loosen the threads. This anthology
exhibits the first deep breaths.
From Leonard Cohen’s Beautiful Losers to John Riddell’s Pope Leo El Elope
(a tale that recounts a papal assassination, using only the letters E, L,
O, and P) to the most radical écriture féminine of Audrey Thomas and Gail
Scott, Ground Works displays Canadian writing as it’s never been seen
before.

The idea for the anthology was Margaret Atwood’s. She introduces Ground
Works, and joins forces with avant-garde poet Christian Bök to collect the
very best experimental fiction written in English between 1965 and 1985.
Read unusual writing by such luminaries as Michael Ondaatje and Matt
Cohen, along with innovations by George Bowering, Christopher Dewdney,
Steve McCaffery, and Daphne Marlatt, as well as more obscure work by Ray
Smith, J. Michael Yates, Andreas Schroeder, Derk Wynand, and Robert Zend.

A surreal array of beautiful anomalies, Ground Works celebrates the
innovators behind the unruly iconoclasm at work in Canada’s best fiction.

i've missed a lot of this discussion, but i wanna throw in the many
transcripts of lenny bruce's various obscenity trials, and also Carlo
Ginzburg's The Cheese and the Worms, about a 16th c italian miller
tried and condemned as a heretic during the (long) inquisition.  it's
a wonderful account of a lively mind.

Probably  Rossellini's "Giovanna d'Arco al Rogo/ Joan at the Stake,"
(issued in both languages), Ingrid Bergman's second shot at the role. But
the anecdote sounmds like PR--most film crews are pretty emotionless.

Carl Dreyer's silent "Passion of Jian of Arc" (Falconetti as Joan) is the
locus classicus--great film, tho to my mind his  (sound) "Day of Wrath"
beats almost anything.

The Junot Diaz anthology is Beacon Best of 2001--and
it has a story by my very best friend in it, which is
itself a sort of cross between conventional and
avant-garde, so it has my vote!  They put out another
one this year which has another friend in it,
actually.

The other idea would be an issue of Conjunctions, or
Grand Street, or Open City, or some other hefty
journal all of which have a mix of styles of fiction
(I think).

Congrats on being Miss Firecracker, Dodie!

     There was also a historical account of the trial of a pig for
witchcraft -- which was made into a film in France, "L'Avocat" and came to
America as "The Advocate;" I don't know the name of the underlying novel,
but I believe there was one.   Cats, goats, pigs, and occasionally dogs,
were tried as witches on occasion in medieval France, sometimes as a way to
avoid prosecuting the actual guilty (human) parties.  There is a late
medieval animal trial fable by the Scottish poet Robert Henryson called "The
Trial of the Fox." -- I can't name any specific one, but I think there were
trials of the devil in some of the medieval mystery plays.  There is a
looong trial of numerous heretics from a Puritan standpoint in a huge, awful
poem written by an early (colonial period) American preacher, called The Day
of Doom. Also in America, but much later, there's the Stephen Vincent Benet
story 'The Devil and Daniel Webster,' in which the eloquent Congressman
successfully defends a man's soul from the Devil in a trial format.

   Bataille did a whole book on the trial of the sadist Gilles de Rais.  The
trial of Marat has also been dramatized, and so has Danton's trial -- is it
called "Danton's Death"? In The Count of Monte Cristo, there is a brief
account of the trumped up legal proceedings by which Edmond Dantes is
interned in the prison; and isn't there also the trial for stealing bread in
Les Miserables?  There is the kangaroo court convened by Athos in his
identity as the Conde de la Fere in the Three Musketeers, in which he
invokes his power as a nobleman with "the authority of the high, low, and
middle justice" to condemn to death the cardinal's spy Milady, who was also
his wife.

 There is a trial of Rebecca of York as a witch in Ivanhoe, a trial by a
jury of Templar Knights which is finally resolved in a trial by combat
between Ivanhoe and the knight who put Rebecca in this pickle.  There is a
trial in "Poema de Mio Cid," the Spanish national epic, in which El Cid
demands that the sons of a noble family be tried for dishonoring his
daughters -- but then breaks the rules of the trial by wearing weapons into
court before the King. There is a portrayal, based on the actual transcript,
of the trial of Thomas More in "A Man for All Seasons," in which he
unsuccessfully argues as a legal principle the maxim "qui tacit consentire."
(And isn't there a trial in Woijcek?)

   Early in the 20th century, there was a series, "Famous British Trials,"
which contained transcripts of exactly that.  They included the real-life
case that Terence Rattigan used for his play, "The Winslow Boy."  And there
are at least two plays dramatizing the trial of Oscar Wilde.

    Jorie Graham makes some use of the Eichmann trial in one poem, which I
can find if you really want it, and it was famously fictionalized as a play
by Robert Shaw [?], "The Man in the Glass Booth."  And I think Pamela White
Hadas may have done one of her Watergate Wives poems in the form of a
dramatic monologue of trial testimony.

     One doesn't see the trial procedure, but in Aeschylus' Prometheus
Bound, two of Zeus' lackeys (Kratos & Bios?...  it's been a while) give
Prometheus lengthy explanations of why he's pinned to the rock -- their
speeches are very much given in the nature of judicial justification.  And
I'm trying to remember -- is there a mock trial somewhere in Aristophanes?
Or in the old Arabic poem The Parliament of the Birds?

      There's Gilbert & Sullivan's "Trial by Jury."  And in a similar vein,
there are trials in light fiction -- Rumpole of the Bailey comes first to
mind. There are small canonical trials in the Brother Cadfael mystery
series.  P.G. Wodehouse interjects bits of dialogue between the bench and
the accused in some of his Bertie and Jeeves stories.

     And then there are the endless, wildly erroneous, trials in movies and
TV.  I have been an appellate litigator doing occupational safety and health
cases for nearly 25 years, and I mostly avoid them.  I watched Ally McBeal
once and permitted myself a little fantasy of firing her.  But I loved My
Cousin Vinny.

hello everyone

i am attending the first two weeks of naropa's summer workshop in
boulder, CO, and am looking into housing options (and no, i can't
afford to pay $280/week to stay in the Sangha House). If anyone on
this list knows of someone in Boulder who could put up a poor poet
from San Francisco -- the dates are June 9-22 -- please backchannel to
me at this address.

thanks,

David Hadbawnik

"We all believe this: at every moment in our lives, we look like ourselves;
others, whom we have not met, whom we know only through photographs, become
fixed at certain intervals. We know them only as they appear in these
photographs. As authors continue to publish books the jacket photos are
usually updated every few years: a given photograph corresponds to a given
book, or a certain phase of work. In the case of dead authors one or two
pictures come to stand for the entire life: all of Scott Fitzgerald's books
were written by the fresh-faced, unsozzled Scottie; all of Henry James's by
the bald magister. The longer the life, the greater the output, the more
intense the degree of photographic compression: a single photograph of
Dickens is sufficient to accomodate thirty years and tens of thousands of
pages of work. Such a photograph serves to consolidate - to embody - the idea
of the writer whose death was announced in a famous essay of Barthes. Or, to
put it in terms consistent with this notion, a photograph of a writer is not
really a photograph of a person but an emblem - a colophon - of the works
published under his or her name. Inevitably a considerable degree of
distortion takes place when a single photograph represents a working life
covering several decades."

       "In death Lawrence became identical with his canonic image. Death
fixed the image, rendered it - and the body of work of which it was the
symbolic expression - incapable of further development. That is why Lawrence,
like Rilke, hated photographs of himself. To both writers photographs
prefigured an end to becoming.
       Virtually the final creative act Lawrence was involved in before his
death at the sanatorium at Venice was to sit for a bust by the sculptor Jo
Davidson. The last photo I had of Lawrence was not of the man but of the
living-death mask that resulted from these sessions. 'Jo Davidson came and
made a clay head of me - made me tired,' Lawrence moaned in a postscript to
his very last letter, 'result in clay mediocre.' It was anything but that,
but it is not surprising that Lawrence responded like this, was reluctant,
even at this late stage, to recognise the stark fact of his own mortality:
what must it have been like to see his death take shape, to become fully
formed, undeniable like this? To have seen a death mask of himself while
still - just -alive? 'What do I care for first or last editions?' he asked,
rhetorically, years earlier. 'To me, no book has a date, no book has a
binding.' No wonder he was hostile to Davidson's bust: it anticipated - if
only by a few days - the form the loose pages of his life would take when
bound and dated."

- _ Out of Sheer Rage: Wrestling with D.H. Lawrence_ by Geoff Dyer


Does anyone still feel this way about photographs of themselves? Barthes,
whom Dyer mentions above, describes photography similarly, as a transmitter
of death, in _Camera Lucida_. Debord, whom kari edwards quotes in a recent
post, likewise saw in modern visual media, coupled with capitalist-fueled
reification on all social levels, a kind of death in life: a society of pure
spectacle. Stephen Rodefer in the preface to _Four Lectures_ asks, "In a
world in which there are more photographs than there are bricks, can there be
more pictures than there are places?" He calls for a painted poetry
commensurate to an age where everything is continually being painted and
painted over: "The events and systems that embody this swarming *state* of
affairs have become so mixed, complex, and unconscious at once, that what is
required to read it is the ultimate painting." I tend to think of my poems as
snapshots of a moment, or an intermingling of moments. The poem keeps the
moment(s) alive in time. A time painting.

More from Dyer's Lawrence book. I don't totally *agree* with this, if
agreement or disagreement is the appropriate response, but I share the
sentiment. Chances are, if you make your wages in academia, you do not share
it. Whatever floats yer botox.

"I burned it in self-defence [_A Longman Critical Reader in Lawrence, edited
by Peter Widdowson_]. It was the book or me because writing like that kills
everything it touches. That is the hallmark of academic criticism: it kills
everything it touches. Walk around a university campus and there is an almost
palpable smell of death about the place because hundreds of academics are
busy killing everything they touch. I recently met an academic who said that
he taught German literature. I was aghast: to think, this man who had been in
universities all his life was teaching Rilke. *Rilke!* Oh, it was too much to
bear. You don't teach Rilke, I wanted to say, you kill Rilke! You turn him to
dust and then you go off to conferences where dozens of other
academic-morticians gather with the express intention of killing Rilke and
turning him to dust. Then, as part of the cover-up, the conference papers are
published, the dust is embalmed and before you know it literature is a vast
graveyard of dust, a dustyard of graves. I was beside myself with
indignation. I wanted to maim and harm this polite, well-meaning academic
who, for all I knew, was a brilliant teacher who had turned on generations of
students to the _Duino Elegies_. Still, I thought to myself the following
morning when I had calmed down, the general point stands: how can you know
anything about literature if all you've done is read books?"

   Along the same lines, the actual transcripts of the Nuremberg trials.

 Or their fictional version, "Judgment at Nuremberg," made into a film with

OPEN CITY Books presents a new release and two readings...

World on Fire by Michael Brownstein

An impassioned, prophetic examination of transnational capitalism=B9s
consequences, World on Fire moves back and forth between the present
and a vividly realized post-apocalyptic future. Combining narrative,
poetry, and social analysis into a new nonfiction form, World on Fire
draws on the work of many contemporary writers including Noam Chomsky,
Eduardo Galeano, and Vandana Shiva. Manifesto and call to arms,  World
on Fire offers a new perspective, encouraging us to move past ego=B9s
limited agendas and create a new life.

"Hard to put down, stopping no place for very long yet honed in on
one . . . cathartic theme: how to defeat social and political
indifference when fear and self-loathing are the engines of the economy
itself. This is one of the most eloquent recent poetic works to cover
the downsides of progress and to cry out for a counterpunch against the
manipulations of empire."
--(Starred Review) Publishers Weekly

This paperback original will be available in bookstores May 22, and is
available now at http://www.opencity.org/subscribe.html

Please join us for these New York City readings:

Wednesday, May 22, 7 p.m., KGB Bar, 85 E. 4th Street

You are thinking of a silent film called _The Passion of Joan of Arc_
directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer.  (Sorry if I'm misspelling the director's
name, I'm too lazy at this second to look it up).  It's a deserving classic,
and to anyone who hasn't seen it who has any interest in film I would say
it's required viewing.  Godard has his protagonist attend a screening of
this film in _Vivre Sa Vie_.  By the way, the twenty-something actor who
plays the sympathetic monk is somebody named Antonin Artaud, if anybody on
this list has heard of him.  (Naw, probably not)--

Mark DuCharme

(p.s.: & yes, Maria, I think the actress's name _is_ Maria Falconetti,
although she reminds me a bit of the young Ingrid Bergman).

There's The Bellamy Trial, a novel from 1927 by Frances Noyes Hart,
which Kevin Killian gave to me way back in our wooing days (mid-80s).
"The first novel-length courtroom drama, based on the Hall-Mills
murder case and focussing on two journalists rather than lawyers."

text-crawl, bottom-screen:

codework:: f({x}) -> {y} - any mapping is sufficient - TRACE of the
road-vector against the MESS or TANGLE across the glades path.  it
is the arrow - not the terms - that fascinates me - the arrow which
INSISTS on a mapping, linguistic or perceptual. one APPROACHES code
with code; the retina always already encodes, and further coding
provides a bracketing or intersection of terms x^~x permitting
definition. but BETWEEN x and ~x (not-x), there is a chasm or
FISSURE; inscription transforms FISSURE into CLIFF. do you follow
me? I am winging this. in this REALM, everything is inchoate, fuzzy;
one is immersed in the DIALOGIC of FLOWS among schema, scripts,
goals, regimes, mappings, sememes, and configurations. these moments
are THROUGH the path or road, not DOWN. HERE, I have no shadow. THAT
DAY, I was covered in sand-midge, mosquito, and deer-fly bites; I
carried a fever everywhere. but that day I drove the seven miles
brilliantly, reaching my destination in record time. ... ... ... ...
consider a CODE as a MESH with PARASITIC INTENTION. the PARASITE is
the nexus; in the absence of the parasite, all that's left is the
problematic of a 'natural' protocol. it is the PARASITE that
inhabits the sememe; it is the PARASITE that INSCRIBES. think of the
TEE formation: f({x}) <> |P| <> {y}. I inhabit the parasitic; the
road and path penetrate me: I gasp the name of the code: ROAD-NAME
TRAIL-NAME: ***MILLER*** and ***CHRISTIAN POINT***.

Stills of which were used regularly by Theresa Hak Kyung Cha in much of her
work (as a side note)...

Artaud also played Marat in a (what I thought) was a rather boorish movie
about Napoleon...

...I wonder how many poets outside academia actually read academic criticism? I
bet it's not that many - thinking about it, I can recall reading at least 2, and
have got about 4 stacked on the shelves. I did not do a literature-related
degree so I'm probably not a typically case on a list like this.

Reading Kenner or Northrop-Frye (if that's what lit students due these days and
I bet it isn't) whilst doing a degree might possibly count - but what of after?
How many litcrit books bought since leaving the hallowed eaves?

I don't totally agree with the mortuary tendancies expressed below, but the
smell of decay and in-talking (all those footnotes!) can become unattractive.

Rescue Efforts Lift Poets' Voices From Fraying Tapes

By STEPHEN KINZER

      AN FRANCISCO - The melodic voice of Marianne Moore echoed from a
reel-to-reel tape recorder at
      the American Poetry Archives here on a recent morning. She was
reading her poems to an enthusiastic
      audience in 1957, and the tape offered delights quite different
from those that come from reading a
printed page.

Before reciting a poem called "Light Is Speech" Moore explained that
it was inspired by a legend about a bandit
and a bag of gold. She thanked her audience for applause that was
"very gratifying, consoling," and then told
about an argument she had with Richard Wilbur over the use of hyphens
in poetry. Several times she interrupted
her reading to try out different words or phrases, explaining at one
point, "I'm rewriting this as I read it."

In the poem Moore asserted:

Impartial sunlight, moonlight
Starlight, lighthouse light,
Are language.

As the tape wound on, the archives manager, Jiri Veskrna, hovered
nearby, watching a computer screen. He was
turning the Moore reading into a digital recording, since the tape on
which it was originally recorded was
starting to disintegrate.

This process is being repeated at poetry centers around the United
States. Three of the largest - in San
Francisco, New York and Boulder, Colo. - have recordings of many of
the greatest 20th-century poets. Often
these tapes were made in casual settings where the poets felt free to
muse, explain and joke as well as read. But
the recordings, many of them decades old, are in poor condition.

"Some of them already have to be cut and spliced because they are
very fragile or even have breaks in them,"
Mr. Veskrna said. "Age isn't the only problem. A lot of the tape
stock was less than ideal to start with.
Companies were experimenting with chemical formulas used to make
magnetic tape, and some of those
experiments were less than successful in terms of longevity. If these
recordings aren't transferred to other
formats soon, we could lose quite a lot of them forever."

The American Poetry Archives has been sponsoring readings since 1954.
Partly because of its location in San
Francisco, which has for years been a hotbed of interest in poetry,
it has attracted many of the best-known
American poets. Those whose readings are now being transferred to
digital format include Theodore Roethke,
William Carlos Williams, Allen Ginsberg, Langston Hughes, Delmore
Schwartz, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Maya
Angelou, John Ashbery and Adrienne Rich.

A decade ago archivists here began to notice that their collection
was deteriorating. Filmy crusts appeared on
some tapes. Others became so brittle they could barely be unwound.

The archive is part of the creative writing program at San Francisco
State University, and the university
responded to its appeal for help. In 1995 it provided a new,
climate-controlled storage room to replace the old
one, which had a boiler room on one side and a chemical-intensive
photo darkroom on the other.

Machines to play the old tapes are hard to come by, but the archive
has managed to buy some from second-hand
dealers and scavenge others from companies that no longer had any use for them.

"We have tapes that we literally have to scrape to get the corrosion
off, or bake and then dry so they can be
played," said Steve Dickison, executive director of the American
Poetry Archives. "Getting this room to
preserve our tapes was very important. It prevented what could have
been a huge crisis, and it allows us to
preserve a resource that's immensely valuable to teachers and poets.
Hopefully the other places that are facing
this problem will have as much luck as we've had."

Another institution seeking ways to combat the relentless decay of
magnetic tape is Naropa University in
Boulder. It has 7,000 hours of cassette tapes, many of them dating
back 20 years or more. The tapes have a
normal life span of 10 years.

About two-thirds of the 103 poets whose work is included in the
Norton Anthology of Postmodern American
Poetry are on tape at Naropa. So are many writers from other
countries. They not only read poetry, but also
gave lectures, led discussions and even composed on tape. Among them
are Gregory Corso, Anne Waldman and
Ed Sanders, sometimes playing to musical accompaniment by the likes
of Philip Glass, Cecil Taylor and Don
Cherry.

Naropa is raising money and applying for grants to pay for converting
these tapes to digital recordings. It now
has no archivist and no full list of what the tapes contain.

"Listening to these tapes is a fantastic experience because oral
performance is such a vital part of the ongoing
literary tradition," said Clara Marie Burns, a librarian at Naropa.
"What's on the printed page is what most
people get, but this is so much richer."

She continued: "We have the tapes in a temperature-controlled room,
but it's probably not controlled enough,
and the tapes will deteriorate anyway, no matter where they're
stored. I'm doing what I can, like making tape
copies of some of the most important material. But that harms the
original and in any case is not a real solution."

Another trove of poetry tapes is stored in a Manhattan basement. They
are owned by the Poetry Project at St.
Mark's Church, in the East Village, which has been sponsoring public
readings since the early 1970's. The
hundreds of poets represented include Andrei Voznesensky and
poet-musicians like Jim Carroll, Patti Smith,
Suzanne Vega and Lou Reed.

"About a quarter of our tapes need repair or restoration," said Ed
Friedman, artistic directory of the Poetry
Project. "It's pretty urgent. We don't have the resources to do
what's necessary to save them, and we've begun
looking for a university or public library that would accept the
whole archive and rescue it."

Transferring these audio tapes to digital format will make the
recordings more widely available to the public.
The archive in San Francisco has already begun offering audio
cassettes, and the one in Boulder says it will issue
a greatest-hits CD later this year to use as a fund-raiser. Demand
for these recordings is remarkably strong. The
San Francisco archive, for example, is printing 10,000 copies of a
catalog, listing what it has available for
purchase, but will send out only about 500 at a time, to avoid being
swamped by orders.

"The 1950's and 60's began a real democratization of poetry, and that
led us to everything from poetry slams to
rap music," said Steven Taylor, director of the audio preservation
and access project at the Naropa archive.
"There's a massive audience for the spoken word, including in the MTV
generation. We don't have any doubt
that there's a big market for what we have. All we need to do is put
it into a format that can reach people."

yes i meant the actress, not hte director.  carl dreyer is danish , i point
out w/ pride, one of the very few famous danes of the 20th c.--or any time.
there's an amazing shot of maria falconetti in theresa cha's dictee. shorn
and weeeping.  female national martyrdom is a big theme in the book, for
those unfamiliar.

I have read most of it, Andrew. I never read poetry books sequentially, so I
never know quite when I've made the rounds, but Telepathy has spent a couple
of months on my desk.

To my envy, Devin makes it look easy. It doesn't appear he's trying to
impress anybody, yet the poems are crystalline, compact, elegant. Also
they're readable--they don't overwhelm. There are no long, drudgerous poems
in the set.  Devin has a wonderful economy of expression, getting a lot out
of each turn, each word.  The poems are fine & deliberate, like ouija board
readings.

Let's talk about the author photo, however. The man looks as serious as
Morrissey.

(Has anyone noticed that "ouija" is a combination of two european ways of
saying "yes"?  How positive!  How romantic.)

This is probably a waste of time, but I feel the need to clarify some things:

1) The end of "more on the function of author photos," where I start talking
about time, was to be a lead up to a response to Geoffrey's Gatza criticism
of the Stein I excerpted from her book _Picasso_. Stein's distinction between
artists/creators, those interested in making the present, and academics,
those interested in divvying up the past, seems pretty clear to me. The
(contemporary) artist reinvents what's good and bad, old and new. The
academic works according to past models (to put it pedantically, christ what
am I doing). I don't think this shows ignorance of the past or a denial of
"the cyclical nature of creation and destruction." Anyway, I thought I'd
been, you know, like vocal in my criticism of certain notions of innovation
and originality in other contexts ('Poetry as Social Practice' being one of
them). I guess the eminently nonlinear Stein isn't as sacred around here as I
assumed.

2) Regarding Kasey's criticism of my misinterpretive response to Joel K.'s
post about politics and form: Kasey is right that I get the exact meaning of
the 'it' wrong in that post. I just happen to think Joel is wrong to believe
that once a poetic form has been stripped of its politics (e.g.,
non-narrative no longer automatically = leftist, radical, subversive, if it
ever did) what remains is just the politics of community, a poem's 'social
implementation', as a guide to determing its political or aesthetic
value/meaning. Joel says it's no longer about 'content' -- a word he use to
mean form it seems, the actual text of the poem. Whereas for me it's all
about content now. The most radical form and technique doesn't *mean* much of
anything without a radical content, as Jennifer Moxley will tell you. This
goes back to the debate between Watten and Bernstein about non-normativity
and cultural materials (in _Bride of the Assembly Line_) which I retranslate
into a larger context in my essay _No Surprises_ ,defined by a dialectics of
autonomy and mimesis. Feeling the null point creeping up again....

3) The point I was trying to make in my snotty "you didn't have to tell us
you were a Marxist" was not very clear. It was like saying quoting from the
Bible (or Jameson) doesn't make you a Christian. I don't know what Joel's
politics are, I just know what he says. And while his language (and its tone)
seemed Marxist, the spirit of his first post seemed conservative and
patronizing. That's what I was responding to. I'd like to call myself a
Marxist but it'd be misleading because politically -- when it comes to
knowing exactly what to do to change things -- I'm at a loss. If someone has
the answers and can tell me what to do to get the ball of revolution rolling,
drop me a line. Send me a sign.

George,

I'm so jealous of Canadian innovative prose writers--I can't even
imagine what it would feel like to live in a country where there is a
context and value for one's work.  I know you're not in heaven, but
you folks are so lucky.

FYI:  I did a search for "And Other Stories" on Amazon, and it came
up with 6599 results, ordered by Amazon sales ranking, number one
being The Sneetches and Other Stories Dr. Seuss.

The National Literature We Deserve

May 8, 2002

Think reality TV is stressful? Try reality publishing.

The game works like this: Jack Stoddart’s General Publishing Company
Limited owes its creditors $45.7-million. And starting April 30, it has
thirty days and a million bucks to come up with a restructuring plan.

General’s creditors include the Bank of Nova Scotia and the Government of
Canada ... and around half of the literary small presses in the country.
You can bet your last book that the banks and other large creditors — such
as Douglas & McIntyre and Key Porter Books — will see their money, or most
of it. These creditors can afford to sue, which would make matters much
worse for General.

But the little presses, always pressed for cash and resources, will be the
first ones pushed off the island.

•   •   •

Throughout the General debacle, the mainstream press has focussed
speculation on what will happen to the large and reasonably lucrative
publishing arms of the General empire:

     * Stoddart Publishing —home to non-fiction superstars like David
Suzuki, Maude Barlow and Alberto Manguel; and
     * Irwin Publishing — an educational publisher that actually made sales
of $13.5-million last year.

Covering the story this way is pure journalistic pragmatism: most readers
recognize the names of the authors involved, and they can appreciate the
drama of large companies changing hands. (Will the list remain intact? Will
foreign investors be allowed to bid? Stay tuned!)

The story that’s falling through the cracks has to do with the fate of
General Distribution Services (GDS) and the small presses whose books it
warehouses. It’s a less sexy story, because it’s more complex. It involves
more players, less money per press and fewer famous authors. What’s more,
the damage caused by a GDS collapse will be systemic, long-term and not
immediately noticeable.

GDS is a distributor: it acts as a conduit between publishers and
booksellers — warehousing titles and shipping them out to stores, and then
writing cheques to publishers as booksellers' payments come in.

That’s the theory, anyway. Over the last eighteen months, the practice at
GDS has been quite different. Many publishers didn’t receive full payment
for most of the 2001 year. That made it difficult (impossible in some
cases) to print books for the 2002 season. Tens, even hundreds of thousands
of dollars are still owed to many presses. Anna Porter, publisher of Key
Porter Books, told the National Post, “I think the last time Jack Stoddart
paid me, Jesus was in short pants.”

To make matters worse, many publishers can’t even retrieve their own books
from General’s warehouse to sell them somewhere else.

At Coach House, we’ve been phoning General for three weeks. When someone
deigns to answer the phone at all, they say they’re too busy to pick our
books now, and we might get them “next week” — but the clock is ticking. If
our books are still in the warehouse when General’s creditors come calling
for the last time, we may never see our inventory or the money we’re owed
for books that have already sold.

•   •   •

Why does it matter if a few small poetry and literary fiction publishers go
under? Because the small presses are the heart, the soul and the guts of
Canadian literary culture.

Presses like Coach House, Talonbooks, Oberon, Mercury, Broken Jaw,
Turnstone, TSAR, Brick and Arsenal Pulp invest the most time and energy in
author development. We’re the farm teams: we find promising new authors,
edit their work and otherwise help them develop their writing styles. And
we get that work to market for the first time — usually in better-quality
editions than mass-market paperbacks, to boot. In other words, the editors
of the small press are responsible for the stunning variety and high
calibre of Canadian writing today.

The small presses can’t afford big advances, so we inevitably lose our
authors to larger publishers. No hard feelings: many small-press editors
are also authors who’d do the same if they had the chance. Moreover, sales
of our backlist titles usually rise when one of our authors moves on to a
larger press, so there’s a certain trickle-down benefit. Most readers don’t
ever see the effort that we’ve put into author development. They only reap
the benefits when they buy one of the first mass-market titles that an
author produces.

In Saturday’s Globe and Mail, Sandra Martin and Rebecca Caldwell presented
a list of “New Canadian Writers: 10 To Watch ” — along with the assertion
that, after the collapse of General Publishing, “the business of writing
and publishing [in Canada] will go on as before.” I wish I could be that
confident. It must be easier to make the contention when focusing on
writers published by large houses. Only one writer on their list is
currently being published by a small press.

But a little forensic work tells a predictable story. Most of the authors
on the Globe list had their first few books published by Canadian small
presses, and most had stories in small-press anthologies and local literary
magazines. Without those first chances and valuable slivers of exposure,
it’s doubtful that these writers — and the majority of our literary
superstars, for that matter — would be the successes they are today.

In the end, if we ignore the plight of the Canadian grassroots presses,
we’ll get the national literature we deserve: bland corporate monoculture
from coast to coast.

Subject: [LACN] CAC Budget Cuts

Dear 24th Street Theatre Friends,
We need you to write your legislators on behalf of all state arts
organizations!  Due to massive budget cuts, the state's Arts budget is being
slashed by 57%.   This means the grant 24th Street already secured to pay
for next year's classes for inner-city students from Norwood School will be
cancelled.  But more importantly than 24th Street's losses, it means a
devastating loss for millions of citizens statewide who may no longer reap
the benefits of our much needed California Arts Council!  We've had the
honor to work with the CAC for many years and I can tell you that it is an
agency that really champions artists in a way that noone else does.  The
gutting of the CAC's staff and prgramming would be a tragic loss for all
Californians!

Please take a minute to write your legislators today requesting that some of
the funding be restored.  We've provided a link  so that you can easily find
your legislators' email addresses.
http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/yourleg.html

The Arts Council asks you to request three things in your letter:
Critical for the CAC is that: 1) there be no preferential treatment and that
the $2 million for the Simon Wiesenthal Center be placed  into our budget to
save programs and staff; 2) the CAC be allowed to determine how it spends
its money; 3) an additional restoration of funding be placed back into the
CAC budget as other agencies are not receiving a proportional cut in
funding.

Thanks for taking a minute to make your voice heard!
Jay McAdams
Executive Director
24th Street Theatre, Los Angeles

From Rob Lautz, California Arts Council
Subject:    CAC Budget Crisis

Dear Friends.....

As you may have heard, on Tuesday the Governor announced his May Revise of
the budget for fiscal year 2002-03. He is proposing a reduction to the
California Arts Council budget in the amount of $16.3 million. This is a cut
of 57%. If this stands, staff and programs will be cut.

The Governor's plan calls for the elimination of the Artists in Residence
Program, Traditional Folk Arts Program, Artists Fellowship Program, Touring
and Presenting Program, State Local Partnership Program, and the
Infrastructure Initiative (includes California Indian Basketweavers
Association, Pilipino Arts Network, California Asian American Pacific
Islander Arts Network, Latino Arts Network, etc).

Only two programs would be left, Organizational Support (OSP) funded at $5
million and Arts in Education funded at $6 million. The Multi-Cultural Arts
Development (MCAD) programs are in the same funding category as OSP which
means that MCAD programs will be reduced dramatically, but not be totally
eliminated.

The Governor's plan keeps $2 million for the Tools for Tolerance Program at
the Simon Wiesenthal Center. This $2 million is not part of our program
budget and does not go through a panel process. This one is receiving
preferential treatment.

If you have an opinion about these budget cuts and the impact it will have
on the arts in California you may wish to contact your legislator. You can
find out who your legislator is at www.leginfo.ca.gov/yourleg.html

Critical for the CAC is that: 1) there be no preferential treatment and that
the $2 million for the Simon Wiesenthal Center be placed  into our budget to
save programs and staff; 2) the CAC be allowed to determine how it spends
its money; 3) an additional restoration of funding be placed back into the
CAC budget as other agencies are not receiving a proportional cut in
funding.

Thank you for your concern. Hopefully you will assist in educating your
representatives regarding the impact these cuts will have in their
districts.

For more information watch for Barry's Directors Weekly report. You can also
go to the website for California Arts Advocates: www.calartsadvocates.org


Sincerely,

Rob Lautz
Manager, Artists in Residence Program

POETRY READING & WORKSHOPS

by LISA JARNOT & RON SILLIMAN

Reading Time: Saturday, May 18, 7pm
Location: MOCA (Museum of Contemporary Art)
191 E. Toole Ave., Tucson
NW Corner of Toole and 6th Ave. in downtown Tucson
Suggested Donation: $5 admission / $3 students

Workshop Times: Sunday, May 19, 1:00–2:25 pm (Lisa Jarnot), 2:35–4:00 pm
(Ron Silliman)
Location: MOCA (Museum of Contemporary Art)
Participation fee: $10 for one workshop or $15 for both workshops.

Presented by POG, CHAX PRESS, MOCA, and TUCSON WRITERS’ PROJECT.
Supported by funding from Tucson Pima Arts Council and Arizona Commission on
the Arts.

Please call Chax Press at 620-1626 for information.

LISA JARNOT’s books include Some Other Kind of Mission and Ring of Fire. She
is currently a faculty member at Naropa University’s Jack Kerouac School of
Disembodied Poetics.

Author of Xing, Demo to Ink, and many more books, RON SILLIMAN merges the
acrobatics of language poetry with a personal voice that brings his words
close to everyday experience. The Alphabet, a 1200-page work, “seeks to
include as much of the world as possible, especially those aspects that are
least likely to be seen, heard, or recognized.”

        This is a test.
        The hammer of birds (rabbits) secure in the deficit garden, fog along the
coast.
Water hammer, rock board — recurrence as key in phlegmatic analysis
(fellaheen hurdling custard
pie into the face of Bette Midler).
        Friends are perpetually “going to get it together,” jobwise: the coast is
altered one quarter inch.
        Just like that.
                        Ron Silliman
                          from Demo to Ink


I am bludgeoned by this most exotic ocean, currently, I am in the post
office with the prison cells and tides, I am with the fires in the
eucalyptus fog, I am clearing and the colors are all changing, I am changing
colors in the lift of fog, I am almost to Japan, I am circles and the
squirrels revolve, I am missing plastic pets, I am predictions of the sounds
of tides and this.

Become famous! (or infamous) Have your collection of poetry linked to
fakelanpo!  Below you will find a justification and explanation of
fakelangpo which should assure you that it is no shame to be associated with
this genre.  Nor is it any kind of slur on the "real" language poets.  In
fact I'd love it if one of them dared to have work linked to the fakelnagpo
site.  Most of the real LPs wrote fakelangpo without knowing it, like the
guy who was talking in prose for forty years without knowing it...

To have your poetry or web art collection linked to on Fakelangpo (it will
be a button box on the side of the screen, like my poetry), you need to tell
me the URL of the work, plus a title for the collection and a caption for
the box the button will appear in.  In either the title or the caption you
probably want to include your name.  I will design a graphical button that
uses thematic imagery from the title or one of the poems.

You can also have individual works of web art and single poems linked to the
site.  I linked a hypertext poem of mine called Sin and Subway.

I am hoping that this site will have many people's work on it, especially
poetry from the POETICS list people.  I'd like a central place to be able to
read it since I hear them talk about poetry all the time but don't see them
produce it.

The premise of Fakelangpo is that work should be fun, even exciting to read.
The "naive reader" comes up often in the discussion of Fakelangpo, but this
naive reader is not an ignorant reader; he or she is familiar with
contemporary poetry and knows how to appreciate it; he or she naive only in
that he or she has no special insight into why you specifically wrote that
poem.  The naive reader has only the poem.

This is not an anti-theory stance.  Fakelangpo poems may have theory behind
them and indeed many do.  But the theory is implicit in the text of the poem
and could be deduced by an astute critic by reading the poem (along with the
author's other poems and poems which bear a resemblance to the poem).

But the main criterion for Fakelangpo is that it be fun to read.  Not
possible to wade through if you really have to because you are the author's
friend or you are writing a paper on it.  Actually fun.  Fun of course takes
many forms.  It does not mean sweetness and light.  It can mean shocking,
confusing, upsetting, amusing, repulsive, touching, sentimental (but not too
much), thoughtful and so on so long as the evoked emotion/cognition is
desirable to the reader, or to some readers.  Obviously, good poetry is
unlikely to be pleasing to every reader-- if its artistry involves shocking
the reader some readers won't like this and others won't be shocked, but the
readers who get the effect will like the poem.

Quite obviously from the above, Fakelangpo poems are also poems that readers
can hate.  One of the problems with some of the lesser poems in the avant
garde/language poetry-influenced genre, is that they pack so little punch
that one can hardly DISlike them even though there is nothing to like.  They
are just blah.  Fakelangpo poems evoke an actual opinion on the part of the
reader.

Finally, Fakelangpo in its strictest sense refers to Language Poetry which
is fun to read, but the Fakelangpo site is open to poetries of all genres.
It is hoped that it will form an online repository of the poetries of the
members of the poetry discussion groups.  It is always nice to be able to
actually read someone's work and compare it to the strong and apparently
wrong-headed opinions they may be espousing; sometimes looking at the
person's poems gives them added respect and shows they are a real poet and
not just someone with opinions.

To repeat, to have your poetry or web art collection linked to on Fakelangpo
(it will be a button box on the side of the screen, like my poetry), you
need to tell me the URL of the work, plus a title for the collection and a
caption for the box the button will appear in.  In eaither the title or the
caption you probably want to include your name.  Collections of poetry by
virtual bad poets (if they are funny enough) are also welcome.  In this
case, just give me the fake poet's fake name and indicate its fakitude
although I should be able to tell from the poetry...  In either case, I will
design a graphical button that uses thematic imagery from the title or one
of the poems, but if it's fake I will go overboard.

It's interesting to me (or ironic) that, in the
heightening rhetoric against criticism --- that is,
against poetics? ---

the warnings against criticism's evils are taking on
metaphoric form as:

(1) death ("You turn him to dust and then you go off
to sparsely attended conferences where dozens of other
academic-morticians gather") which, needless to say,
seems some type of mirror image confirmation of
Theory-Death somewhere, regardless of whether in no
longer hiding under the rug it's now, like crimes of
passion, justifiable incitement to riot; and

(2) waste ("be very careful not to waste your waste.
That is the key thing: not to waste your waste.  Too
much time gets spent re-inventing the wheel, or
feeling sh--ty"), which, as if by intuited by sixth
sense, is the second leg of Paul Mann's Theory-Death
exposition in ~Masocriticism~: waste.

About dust

[ http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/dustfree.htm ]

and Rilke first, though,--- doesn't Rilke seem to be a
particularly inauspicious or telltale choice for a
poet to cite against the Dead Kennedies of criticism?
inasmuch as he, almost (like Rimbaud or Valery) more
famous for ~not~ having written than for having
written, after all, more than anyone else, is the
author of --- get it? --- The Duino *Elegies,* and the
poetic mausoleum on the death of the nineteen year old
Ruth Ouckama Knoop that the ~Sonnets to Orpheus~ are
("Friend of death, for in easy transformation / it
grew through death a hundred times").  That is, even
if the teacher of German literature had subjected
Rilke to his Midas Touch of a dusty death, who more
the beautiful mortician than Rilke?

[On Rilke's military duty, in lieu of active service,
of ~drawing ruled lines on paper~:

"Industriously he drew vertical and horizontal lines
for hours on end.  Sometimes the spaces between the
lines were only two millimeters wide, but he worked
with perfect accuracy and a genuine humility . . . the
severe geometrical network of pencil lines . . .
almost made a work of out out of it" ---The Australian
writer "Sil-Vara," quoted in Stephen Garmey's 1972
Harper Colophon introduction, p. 19]

But, waste, too:

After repetition as (theory-)death, Mann turns to
waste, and Georges Bataille's doctrines about waste.
In brief, in Bataille, economies do not function on
scarcity, as we generally believe in a "free
market"/capitalist system, and even the niggardly
surplus that economics does allow is insufficient to
reveal anything at the level of ~drive,~ or principle;
he evangelizs instead toward: yes, waste.  Waste, as
one of Bataille's main platforms (the others being:
sacrifice, heterology, and transgression), is cited as
the very expression or eruptive consummation of
theory-death, in that the loss and attrition of
meaning decline in tandem with the degradation into
profligate, generous waste.  The potlatch of the
avant-garde.  (Mann, not insignificantly for the
hypo-critical camp [hy.po- or hyp- ~pref.~ . . . Less
than normal; deficient" --- American Heritage, 1997],
in passing speaks of academic criticism as ~restricted
economy,~ the very opposite of heterology and euphoric
waste, since its forces of containment and
regularization forestall transgression.)

For the time being, I'll let these quotes (below)
serve as further explanation of waste as a signal of
the presence of theory-death.

What I am suggesting is that it is not necessary or
healthy for anti-criticism to explode into destructive
mutilation fantasy ("I wanted to maim"), since their
vengence is a case of mistaken identity.  The
mortician has not ~killed~ the cadaver you find him
near. It simply died, and keeps on dying.  Geoff Dyer
(sic) was

mistaking the mourner for the murderer.

Indeed, maybe criticism, in attempting to reveal that
the avant-garde's relatively recent death still leaves
it half-warm, to locate some posthumous growth of
ideology's good yeast upon it (!!), enrages by thereby
calling attention to what denial had screened out.  (I
wouldn't have noticed if you handed covered him with a
sheet, damn you.)

It's not a bad thing to get all Type A about, though.
We don't have to stop writing poetry because of it.
Hardly, . . . even if sometimes the spaces between the
lines were only two millimeters wide. It doesn't stop
poetry from multiplying, or the fine collectibles
convention from going on.  The avant-garde as Sequel.
We can still wear berets.

Theory-death, is like death at Graceland: every day
there are still Elvis sitings

("Last year, I met a group from a Church of Elvis in
Sweden.  They claim that when they pray to him, he
listens and understands."

---
http://www.student.virginia.edu/~decweb/issue/1998/09/10/word/elvis.html
)


Quotes on WASTE from ~Masocriticism~:

'One's failings in respect to Shakespeare or Hegel or
Bataille are therefore not merely
 intellectual errors, rectifiable through closer
reading: failure becomes, in a sense, the very mode of
our reading: our perpetual failure to cross the line
that separates the reading from the work, no matter
how far we advance in its direction, is at least as
fundamental to us as any insight into the work that we
might have.
. . .
'a principle of absolute expenditure as value, a
"general economy" based on surplus, waste, loss,
sacrifice, ejaculation, excretion, and death. . . . or
the glorious waste . . . ', the potlatch, 'a breach of
every restricted  economy. . . . an exemplary
expenditure, in excess of any possible compensation: a
gift-combat in which one warrior tries to defeat
another by squandering his riches, by giving away so
many exorbitant gifts that the other can never repay
them, even if it means he loses everything in the
process. . . . At bottom, at the economic base of the
basest materialism, all value is waste value,' Van
Gogh's ear as the ultimate avant-garde gift, 'the
extravagant, sacrificial, excretory movement of the
solar anus of art. . . . the abyss of Language Itself
opening onto a curriculum vitae and grounded in an
ideal footnote, a footnote bearing one's own name. . .
. Whatever transgression occurs in writing on Bataille
does so only through the STUPID recuperation' (my
emphasis) 'and hence evacuation of the whole rhetoric
and dream of transgression, only insofar as the false
profundity of philosophy or theory evacuates the false
profundities it apes. . . . [T]he interest of
Bataillean discourse lies chiefly in the compulsive
and symptomatic way it plays with its feces. The
spectacle of critics making fools of themselves does
not reveal the sovereign truth of death: it is only
masocritical humiliation, a pathological attempt to
disavow the specter of death. . . . Nothing is gained
by this communication except profit-taking from lies.
. . . to witness the slow freezing to death of every
satellite text. . . . Theory comes finally to reflect
this circular loss or lack as the interminable and
productive self-consumption, the endless theory-death,
of theory itself. In this movement, theory manages to
transgress every project of transgression by forever
failing to launch it.'

BUDGET UPDATE:

"All day long I hear my telephone ring, friends
calling giving their advice… .."

GOOD NEWS!

Senate Budget Subcommittee #4 today voted to:

1.      Reinstate $7 million into the Arts Council's budget
for allocation among all the programs. The Committee
wanted emphasis in addressing the needs of
multicultural, underserved, inner-city children, and
rural communities.
2.      Reduction of the Simon Wiesenthal Center grant by
$1 million.
3.      Reinstatement of one-half ($562,500) of the
reduction to our operations budget.


The net effect of these changes, if approved by the
Assembly Budget Subcommittee #4 - Chairman George
Nakano (with members Lou Papan, Rod Wright, Rod
Pacheco, and John Campbell) - meeting beginning Monday
of next week, then approved by the Legislature, and
then, if the changes are acceptable to the Governor,
would be that we would have funding to keep every
program in existence (although at a reduced level) and
maintain an adequate staffing level at the agency.

This is only a first step in this process. It is NOT a
final decision. It can be changed by the subcommittee,
the full budget committee, the Assembly, the
Legislature, and the Governor.

Were these changes not approved, as it stands, the
proposed budget would provide funding in only three
line items - Arts in Education; Organizational
Support; and for the Simon Wiesenthal Center. No other
agency programs - touring & presenting, state locals,
special initiatives, artists in residence, folk arts,
public art, et al. would have any funding. This would
be mandated to the agency. We would have no discretion
in allocating the funds in any other way.

But, if the Senate Subcommittee #4 recommendations are
what is finally adopted and approved, then we will be
in a much better position to protect the past 25-year
investment the state has made in the arts, and the
gains we have made thanks to the Governor in the past
two years. Given the size of the deficit, that would
be a very good outcome; rather than a 57% decrease in
the CAC budget, it would now reflect a 31% decrease.

For those of you who have asked for contact
information for legislators, here is a link to get
addresses, phone numbers, etc.
www.leginfo.ca.gov/yourleg.html

If you decide to you want to weigh in, provide a
factual picture of the effect on your community.
Please write or call your local legislators and the
Governor. In your own words, simply and concisely,
state your position. And specifically include the
impact of the cuts on your organization, your
community. Don't make it a missive. Keep it short and
simple. Get people in your community to do the same
thing. For more information, go to the California Arts
Advocates website (www.calartsadvocates.org).

Again, whatever the final outcome, somehow, some way,
we will get through this - and our community will grow
even stronger because of it. With luck, this bitter
pill will be short-lived. Making the case now will
help to position the arts for priority recovery. And
maybe there is enough wiggle room to lessen the impact
of the hurt.

Whatever you do, Don't Quit.

Jeffrey,

And for "since their vengence is a case of mistaken identity", perhaps:
"since its vengeance is a case of mistaken identity"?

And for "It's not a bad thing to get all Type A about", perhaps: "It's not a
something to get all Type A about"?

And for "Elvis sitings", perhaps: "Elvis sightings"?

If you're going to errata, might as well errata!


As to the ~content~ of your post, I'll mention only that I have no trouble
with the initial conflation of poetics and criticism. I recognize instead a
division of ~practice~ and criticism. Hence I agree not only with Hess's
reading of Stein, and with Andrew's inspiring posts, but with the following
statement from the SUNY-Buffalo poetics program's "information sheet"--

"'Every doing,' the anonymous spirited pamphleteer declares, using the word
'poetics' against itself, 'carries the potential of something new, emergent,
something not already predicated by poetics. Practice overtakes theory,
practice changes theory. And not just writing practice, but performance
practice, the practice of sound.'"

http://www.jacketmagazine.com/01/schultzbuffalo.html

Heaven forbid "practice" should constantly look over its shoulder to see how
"theory" takes shape behind it.  Such an urge toward critical
self-identification results in bizarre mirages such as "Fakelangpo."  Or
"ellipticism."  Bizarre!  Or Jessica's suggestion that sight supercedes
sound.  Here's to a higher road for our art.

Learn to distinguish poetics from practice.


Cordially,

Aaron S. Belz

let's not take this too seriously.  what would a list look like that =
didn't have names attached to the posts, so the output generated from =
the list would be attributable to none other than the list itself as a =
creative organizing force.  this message and others would appear just as =
text without any source other than a posting to this list.  what would a =
text at the end of a month of this type of production resemble?  a =
string of event listings?  events at all?  opinions and rebuttles?  or =
would it be a unique and creative entity, moving and growing with each =
post?  what purpose.  utility isn't always the correct answer, it is an =
answer.  though the fields are blue and under the moon.  zestfully some =
clean in the irish spring.  as if we should take this all too seriously. =
 what of it.  the ambiguous animal moves along the labial electronic =
line and finds you hunting the keyboard in an effort to be here, now =
here and everywhere.  this in and of itself is redundant.  let's decide =
not to take the keyboard too seriously.  then is not is is not is is not =
garden.  so the machine rolls over on itself, and to what do we owe this =
pleasure.  the pasture.  over and m-e-t-h-o-d man.  here i am, here i =
am.  the method man.  wet grass and smoke from the wet logs on the fire =
into the eyes, stinging, to see where i mean.  there, just there, and =
over.  what is a purpose.  to list.  to like.  to publicize.  we are =
list(en)ing.  we are.  ing.  even electronic.

Anyone on this list attend yesterday's concert? Strangely apolitical for a
commemoration of a communist. Here are some links for anyone who might be
interested. The FBI files are worth scrutinizing as we return to a period of
microsurveillance in the class war. Also: a counter-surveillance report from
the concert. Looks like the Canadians are finally outdoing the Americans in
the sphere of dissent-management. Aaron Vidaver, Vancouver.

>On the US side of the border a half-dozen officers from British Columbia
>Parks and Canada Customs mingled with about 15 counterparts from the
>Washington State Parks service, two Blaine motorcycle cops, the Whatcom
>County sheriff, and a malnourished Washington State Patrol deputy. They

>informally, but the rangers from the State Parks were the only agents
>overtly collecting video surveillance material of the concert-goers. On the
>Canada side, on the north edge of the park, 30-50 officers from the Royal
>Canadian Mounted Police defended the ditch separating Canada from the United
>States of America. These men were dressed in a variety of attire, with
>higher ranking officials in formal wear, including ties, others in
>Securiguard-yellow bike outfits, and the front-line bullyboys in
>bullet-proof flak-vests. Several bicycle blockades were erected at
>checkpoints across the northern perimeter of the field, with police motor
>vehicles. There were no incidents witnessed around the ditch areas.

Dear Readers,

We are delighted to report that the upgraded Rain Taxi website is up and
running--please check in and take a look around.  While we are still
installing some pages and polishing others, the new site features online
ordering capabilities, and will soon have a working search engine and
more information than ever.  Also just posted: our new ONLINE EDITION,
featuring reviews of Alice Notley, Bruce Andrews, Susan Daitch, Kenneth
Goldsmith, Elizabeth Robinson, and many, many others, plus an interview
with John Bennett and an essay on the Black Mountain roots of the Poetry
Project.  All for you at www.raintaxi.com!

Those of you who have lists or literary colleagues, if you can spread
the word we are grateful.

Ulla Dydo
SOUNDZIMPOSSIBLE

Introduced by Bill Rice

SOUNDZIMPOSSIBLE. No, this title s not a misprint. Everyone
knows of Cecil Taylor as a great jazz pianist but few know that
he also performs his own poetry. Ulla Dydo will speak about it
as wordmusic. Like his music, it avoids notation and print. It is
improvised and asks to be heard in his performance. Dydo
comes from years of reading Gertrude Stein, following the
movement of her language without looking for story, event,
representation, meaning. She has edited A Stein Reader, and
her book Stein: The Language That Rises-1923-1934 will be
published by Northwestern University Press in the Fall 2002.
It seemed the most natural step to move from Stein to Cecil
Taylor. (soundzimpossible.com/ceciltaylor is his brand-new
web site.)

Free and open to the public.

I want to see people's poetic PRACTICE which is why I invite them to link to
my fakelangpo site.  One brave soul, Jason Christis has accepted the offer
and I am just waiting for a title for the colllection/making the button.
The more the merrier.

Then we can discusss people's actual poems on the site, which isn't a metter
of poetics but of poetry, a field I like better (poetics is fine too; I
subscribed to this list after all, knowing what the word meant.

  But actually my favorite thing here is the announcements of readings...
Although the best "obscure" one with famous poets that I went oso was on the
NYC Poetry Calendar http://www.poetz.com/calendar/, note here.  It was James
Tate and John Ashbery at an actors' studieo in a bad neighborhood, and there
were lots of students there but few of the ususal suspects who didn't know
about it.

division of ~practice~ and criticism. Hence I agree not only with Hess's
reading of Stein, and with Andrew's inspiring posts, but with the following
statement from the SUNY-Buffalo poetics program's "information sheet"--

"'Every doing,' the anonymous spirited pamphleteer declares, using the word
'poetics' against itself, 'carries the potential of something new, emergent,
something not already predicated by poetics. Practice overtakes theory,
practice changes theory. And not just writing practice, but performance
practice, the practice of sound.'"

http://www.jacketmagazine.com/01/schultzbuffalo.html

Heaven forbid "practice" should constantly look over its shoulder to see how
"theory" takes shape behind it.  Such an urge toward critical
self-identification results in bizarre mirages such as "Fakelangpo."  Or
"ellipticism."  Bizarre!  Or Jessica's suggestion that sight supercedes
sound.  Here's to a higher road for our art.

Learn to distinguish poetics from practice.

What do you think Watten is doing with
the car analogy?  Is he enacting a critique of consumerism?
And, if so, how?  And how does it tally with his claim
that "Buying a new Ford is analagous to participation in public life for Stein;

it got her out onto the streets of the 'capital' as a consequence of her fame
(and not just as a bourgeois author; Mayakovsky is another modernist
who bought a new car)."

Looking at Watten's language (if not necessarily Language's Watten),
I wonder: if buying the new Ford was a CONSEQUENCE of her fame,
wouldn't the analogy between "buying a car" and "participation in public life"
break down, insofar as it implies "her fame" was, previously,
if not exactly pedestrian, at least non-car-ownership...
Q: "is the car necessary for participation for public life for Watten?"
Does he offer an unequivocal answer? If not, is the equivocation
itself a "car?"

>

I only waver in these identifications in that particular essay to the extent
that I read Watten in his particular essay wavering between them....
If you (or someone else) can convince me otherwise,
I am willing to grant the possibility that I have misread Watten's
identification
with the consumerist mode, that maybe I have projected it, but I think you
(or someone else) would need to address the above questions to convince me...

(why is identifying with an assembly-line model automatically an identification

with "reification" for you? Sure, Watten claims it's standard (by implication
TOO STANDARD) to say literature enacts a critique of reification

You lose me with this analogy--are cars more affordable today than when,
and for whom? etc.? Is have they just become more mandatory?
Also, in terms of poetic influences, this analogy, to be elaborated,
would maybe have to consider such pre-AUTO car (if not pre-capitalism)
writers such as Shelley and Shakespeare

But since Watten himself seemed to show some identification with a
consumerist mode in much of his piece (essay?) before he gets to
the assembly-line "account" with producer-identifications, I'm not sure
that *he* "stages" the "which side are you on dilemma" as you do here...
I also question the linkage of desire to "middle class consumerism"
or any consumerism for that matter. Sure, the "discourse of desire"
(as oppossed to need) often can be seen to be linked to it, but....
well, that's another topic...

A collective is not necessarily an assembly line...
I was interested in how Watten tries to identify with the assembly line worker
and how for him such an identification becomes rather mystical (see essay)
in its impersonality, and that despite (or perhaps because of) his modernist
vocabulary, in some ways what he builds to in this essay seems a kind of
romanticist amoral enthusiasm...
My question was not so much what USE this could be for me as
a POET-COMSUMER, but what use this could be for a poet-producer,
especially for one who is interested, in some "envisioned futurity"
as Watten, rather vaguely, defines it. I'm very curious about this "e.f".
After he makes such an identification with the factory worker,
an identification that implies, at least at times, that factory workers
do NOT primarily feel alienated, reified, etc. (which is provocative,
and may challenge certain liberal pieties I might tend to "harbour"),
he then ends on a note of EXHAUSTION--which I took as finally
admitting (almost as a punch-line) all the alienation he had largely
kept at bay in his "carefully plotted sequence."

Yes, and I could be clearer about it---but to do so, I think I'd have to
respond LESS-DIRECTLY to Watten's essay. My piece was an attempt
to work within his particular vocabulary and if indeed there was a degree
of suppression in my essay, it's because there's suppression in Watten's
essay, insofar as he seems to suppress what you call his restaging of
"those initiating conditions of labor which ideally begin the consciousness-
raising process toward a grasp of the process of commodification, etc"
for much of his essay. His essay ENDS with that point, but where
then is his envisioned futurity?

MIME-version: 1.0

a. Poetics can stifle a poet who then will feel rage towards poetics. This
is the gist of "Against Lineage," the last essay in Chris Stroffolino's
collection, Spin Cycle (Spuytenduyvel, 2001): "I'd like to at least consider
the possibility that the strictures and/or demands that many (if not all?)
kinds of poetics makes on its writers can actually stifle to the point where
the only 'equalizing' outlet can be a kind of ostensibly non-poetic
admission of a frustration and rage" with said poetics.

b. Frustration and rage against poetics are not "argued" in "Against
Lineage." As one would expect with affective states, they are expressed.
But, moreover, they are formally enacted in the essay -- by rapidly
juxtaposing disparate poetics scenarios, linked associatively. Each poetics
scenario is tossed like a bit of wet clothing in the heated air of a writing
on permanent "spin cycle." To keep it all agitated the writer must
continually shuffle the various poetics options and not select any
particular option over the others, as doing so would mean that the writing
machine has stopped.

c. "Rage" against poetics is also expressed against poetic lineage and
influence. The persona in the poem "Against Boundaries," inserted in the
essay, is like a Melmoth the Wanderer romantically rebelling against The
Church of Poetics:

                          I WILL BE a romantic
and that's why I'm here among those I hate to
see my reflection in who I need like a ghost I'm
afraid to give up and very well may breathe
into being.

Why does the poet-persona "need" those whom he hates -- i.e. those
contemporary poets representing poetic lineage and influence to him? The
simple answer is that he needs them in order to begin to write a poem, since
they represent the best of poetry to him. While a poet does not have any
choice over the fact that there will be some of his contemporaries who will
represent poetic lineage to him, he does have a choice in how to articulate
a poetic relationship with them -- for instance, whether to "hate" them, or
otherwise.

d. Why does the poet-persona in "Against Boundaries" "hate" those whom he
needs most? To answer this question takes one into the Romanticist literary
devices that the poet uses -- "hate" counterposed to "need," "I," etc.
Notice, in the poetry passage above, how a formal decision has been made to
express and present poetic lineage and influence as the internal conflict of
a subject ("I WILL BE ... among those I hate"). There is an attempt by the
poet to fully internalize, as the psyche and libido of a poeticized
subjectivity, the variety of social and literary investments that constitute
the "need" to write poetry. To perform "internal conflict" about poetic
lineage and influence is, then, to rapidly shuffle or "spin" the available
options, without settling on any particular one, since each is of equal
importance. But moreover, it is to leave undecided -- unanswered -- the
question of how to work out a specific relationship to the varied lineage of
one's poetic influences. It is not that this question of poetic influence is
not posed (obviously it is), nor just that this question is acknowledged but
left unanswered (poetic influences are evident throughout the essay and its
poem); rather, this question of poetic influence is performed without
answering itself. This does provide, however, an answer to the question of
why "hate" those whom one "needs." Frustration and rage -- "hate" -- result
from there being no way to decide on and articulate a specific relationship
to poetic influences based on poetry that would differentiate the poet from
his poetic influences, and render the question of lineage one that now
applies to *his* poetry rather than solely to the poetry that continues to
influence his work. This question of lineage and influence, performed
without answering itself, *becomes the poetry itself*.

e. What comes first, then -- the poetry, or the poetics? Both must come
first simultaneously.

Poetry Comes Before Poetics. To present poetic lineage and influence as an
internalized conflict of a subject, is to suppress the question of lineage
and influence (it is a question of poetics, after all) in the name of
writing poetry. Suppressing the question by internalizing it as the conflict
of a poeticized subjectivity, permits the poet a space in which to write
poetry. It is a Romanticized literary space (Stroffolino's is only one way
of negotiating a space for writing poetry, faced with the question of
lineage and influence). What this device of internalized conflict
establishes, then, is the necessary priority of poetry over poetics -- there
can't be poetics without poetry. As the poem "Against Boundaries" states:
"One can not be placed in poetry by the will of one's poetics." Poetics,
lineage, influence, are even (possibly) for a later time, once poetry has
been written -- for one is only "placed" in poetry by, first and foremost,
writing poetry. And yet, at the same time:

Poetics Comes Before Poetry: One is only "placed" in poetry by writing
poetry, true enough, and yet, the place of poetry itself is always already
taken, as it must be, since one can only write poetry from the example of
previously written poetry. While poetry must come "before" poetics, poetics,
if it is not already there at the start, will eventually catch up to the
poetry -- as the full-blown idea of Language Poetry has done, over time,
with the initiating instances of its practices. However, this originary
moment of a poetry untainted by poetics is *exactly what Chris's work
contests* -- and what my answer to the chicken-and-egg question of poetry
vs. poetics is also taking issue with. It is the classic avant-garde
strategy, faced with the question of lineage and influence, to assert a new
poetry moment without poetics parallel. But the pure lineation required for
such assertions is too easily remappable, as Benjamin Friedlander has shown.
Nevertheless, to a poet faced with the question of lineage and influence,
the example of previous influential poetry often arrives in hand
*simultaneously* with a poetics already seemingly worked out for it.
"Seemingly" worked out, because poetics is generally easier to understand
than poetry, and precisely because poetics can never completely substitute
for poetry. What a poet is confronted with, then, faced with the question of
lineage and influence, is an inverted illusion, namely that poetics precedes
poetry, that poetry is written from poetics, a illusion that is only
dispelled over time by careful reading. And by writing, whether with rage
against poetics, or not. There is no other language with which to begin to
compose a poem than the language of one's lineage of influences (the poetry,
and the poetics).

f. Poetics only "stifles" a poet when the question of lineage and influence
is internalized and enacted as the conflict of a poeticized subjectivity.
But, this act also supplies a "cure" for the stifling. At its best, this
conflict may be formally enacted, as in Chris's poetry and poetics. The
meta-question of why the question of lineage and influence "needs" to be
suppressed (as distinct from other modes of response: imitated, sublimated,
parodied, displaced, etc.) is one for all the poets who began to publish in
the 1990s out of the idea of Language Poetry (among other ideas). But to
answer to why and how certain poets chose to address the question of lineage
and influence specifically by suppressing it, would entail fully
externalizing the social and literary investments that constitute the "need"
to write poetry for these poets. In Chris's particular instances, that need
seems to be internalized as the conflicted psyche and libido of a poeticized
subject.

 Raymond Luczak uses four genres in that book -- a short story, 111
mini-essays, a play, and a self-interview -- to make his points on what
makes art "art" and deafness "deaf." ...  We have the flyer for the two
books on-line at http://www.thetactilemind.com/flyer.pdf  -- let me know if
you have any problems with reading it in that format.  You should also
direct your contacts to the main page at www.thetactilemind.com, which will
lead to the books' pages, which in turn will lead to excerpts on-line and
to the author's web site."

I haven't looked at the site myself, but imagine there's contact info for
him to send you review copies.  if not, let me know and i'll pass on his
contact info to you.

I found this lying in a gutter the other day, the print barely visible from
compound erosions. It's silly that he commands us to read his poems every
season of every year of our lives and has us imagine that his lines could, by
some mystical osmosis, prevent arthritis. If only I could get over my
fascination with what insults the soul, perhaps I could follow this man's
strange path:

"This is what you shall do: Love the earth and sun and the animals, despise
riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy,
devote your income and labor to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning
God, have patience and indulgence toward the people, take off your hat to
nothing known or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely with
powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of
families, read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of
your life, re-examine all you have been told at school or church or in any
book, dismiss whatever insults your soul, and your very flesh shall be a
great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the
silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of your eyes and in
every motion and joint of your body."

Aaron

you and another have mentioned Devin Johnston's Telepathy, just out from
an Australian publisher (but available, I would think, through Flood
Editions or the St. Louis booksellers whose ads are in latest Delmar --
Subterranean or Left Bank Books).  I have just read it myself and think
it's excellent -- a first book that might have had a difficult time in
the American publishing pipeline but here it is and people should know
about it, yes.

Here is a short poem, but representative if any such thing can be:

Stolen Hours

    after the Clock Tax of 1797

I sold my watch

and bought a comb
of shell for her---

deadbeat escape-
ment gone for

shadows, sun
and water---

I admire the carefully placed de-familiarizing gestures here ("a comb of
shell"; and the Muldoonian pun on "deadbeat escape-|ment" -- this last a
word I knew but had to look up to remind myself I knew it; the tight
little idiom "gone for"), and note throughout that while others have
made of the last two decades' poetry a stylistics of difficulty, Devin's
poems are -- as you said -- readerly: the force of our necessary
attention kept always IN the language as it has been used and is
commonly available.  Craft, then -- the trick is not to extend the
language through a new code but to develop constituencies from among an
available (the syllabics here, e.g.) exchange of ways we've read.  The
poem above would seem to refine some area of my paltry understanding of
an episode from the Colonial period, but is rather a love poem, no?
that appropriates the lexicon of said temporal ambience?  Olson, Creeley
and S. Howe are perhaps present in such  gestures, but elsewhere, as has
been noted, the mix is quite different, and what one anyway notices is
the seriousness of the mix -- the poems themselves seem to be readings,
and wittily precise ones at that.

a breath of life, anyhow

I found this in a poems for the millennium, a gift for graduation. Now I
am no longer an academic poet -- only an accountant poet. I will always
cherish the knowledge I have gained from reading criticism -- far too
many excellent example to list have changed the way I view the possible.



WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW TO BE A POET
By Gary Snyder

all you can about animals as persons.
the names of trees and flowers and weeds.
names of stars, and the movements of the planets
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . and the moon.

your own six senses, with a watchful and elegant mind.

at least one kind of traditional magic:
divination, astrology, the book of changes, the tarot;

dreams.
the illusory demons and illusory shining gods;

kiss the ass of the devil and eat shit;
fuck his horny barbed cock,
fuck the hag,
and all the celestial angels
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .and maidens perfum'd and golden=97

& then love the human: wives. . .husbands. . .and friends.

children's games, comic books, bubble-gum,
the weirdness of television and advertising.

work, long dry hours of dull work swallowed and accepted
and livd with and finally lovd. . . . exhaustion,
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . hunger, rest.

the wild freedom of the dance, extasy
silent solitary illumination, enstasy

real danger. . .gambles. . . and the edge of death.

"Protest Genres and the Pragmatics of Dissent"
A Talk by Roger Farr

"Like all speech-acts, protest and opposition often fall into recognizable
genres: the leaflet, the march, the strike, the sit-in, the blockade, etc.
As interlocutors in these speech-acts, the authorities rely heavily on
anticipation and predictability in order to understand, describe, control,
and diffuse our actions. Therefore, we need to anticipate this anticipation;
we need to identify the predictable conventions of the protest genres, and
re-introduce elements of shock, surprise, and misrecognition. We need to
make dissent unreadable."

In a few week's time, Anselm Hollo's Corvus (1995) is going to be
published in Finnish translation by Kai Nieminen, himself a poet and an
established translator. This is, unbelievably, the first time Anselm's
American poetry gets published in book form in his place of origin.=20

To commemorate the event, Tuli&Savu [Fire&Smoke], a Finnish poetry
magazine, is looking for texts on Anselm's significance for the American
poetry, to be published in its August 2002 issue. We will welcome
suggestions for new texts / perspectives, but might also consider
translating earlier stuff on Anselm/Corvus. Depending on the variety of
the material, some of it could also be published on the magazine's
coming, multi-lingual web page.

We'll need the texts / suggestions by June 20, 2002 at the latest.=20

You are welcome to send your texts, suggestions, questions, or urls to
existing material, directly to me to:

With great pleasure, I announce that Cydney Chadwick, of Avec Books, has =
been awarded the prize for best short story collection for her =
book_Flesh & Bone_.  This award is given by the Independent Publishers =
of America.  Her book was chosen from 1,185 titles from 765 presses.  I =
announce it to this list because, while Chadwick writes prose, many of =
her readers are poets, some on this list.  It's worth adding that the =
title story is both unsentimental and extremely moving.  =
Congratulations, Cydney.  =20

the next attack will be in the nyc tunnels. i am sure of it. the next
attack will be in the nyc subways. this is definite. the next attack will
be at the white house in washington d.c. here is how it will happen. a
rocket-by-itself launches against the building from a distance of 3km. i
am certain of it. the next attack will be in this building. i am positive
of the next attack. here is how it will happen. the apartment below me
will be rented. high explosives will arrive. the explosives will be
detonated. why are reruns of events in slow-motion when they are in fast-
motion. here is what this will be. this will be a fast-motion event. a
young man approaches me with forty pounds of attack-plastique-dynamite.
here is what will happen. my skin will be blown off at 300km/hr. in the
tunnels the truck will detonate. the explosion will create high-vacuum at
the center of the tube. every wall will crumble. the upper support beam
will crack and collapse. water will pour in slowly. cars are molten jammed
against one another. temporary dams create high-speed emergent shock-
waves. three lights will be on. i will be in a 1989 blue acura. i will be
directly behind the truck. my skull will smash against a 1998 chevy tahoe.
i will be a tourist at the white house. my legs are blown off at 800km/hr.
my jaw is torn off at the root. there will be two lights. my rerun is in
fast-motion. my jaw is torn off at the root. the apartment below me
explodes violently. my body splits in two in the midst of screaming. there
will be one light. my body splits in two at the root. the apartment splits
in two at the root. my skin is ripped off at 1200km/hr. there will be one
light. my body splits in two at the root. my rerun is in fast-motion. my
jaw is torn off at the root.

Yeah, I was going to get around to saying something on-list about this,
but=20
the past couple weeks have been a whirlwind.

The Creative Commons is a new non-profit group spearheaded by Larry
Lessig=20
(author of "Future of Ideas" which explains the problems we're trying to

solve in a very accessible way), and it seeks to do several things. Let
me=20
see if I can sum up the key points from the perspective of a web=20
designer/developer

_The mostly dry legal stuff_
The point and goals of the project are to get people releasing their=20
creations under terms of copyright that are less strict than the
automatic=20
rights you get when you create something (like this email for example).
You=20
won't be giving up copyright at all, but this will serve as an automated

way of creating custom license, like contracts, that explicitly say what

others can do. Currently, there is no way to do this, and so people
don't=20
use others' images, music, video, and/or text. Changing laws is a slow
and=20
arduous process, but we can automate this stuff with technology, and
allow=20
people to elect for more freer use than the law allows.

_Why it's cool_
The site will eventually offer two simple things: let you create
licenses=20
for your work on the fly, letting you dictate how others can use your
work,=20
and the other thing is you can search for content in the public domain,
or=20
under any combination of the licenses. There will also be an XML-based
API,=20
to let people submit new works and search for works apart from the site,

allowing developers to integrate their systems with ours.

Once that is all in place, you'll be able to find material you can use
for=20
your own projects, and let people use your creations, which has numerous

benefits including building up your reputation and getting your name out

there. Imagine a Google image search filled with great stuff that was
all=20
public domain. Or imagine using Google's image search to grab images for
a=20
collage in photoshop you'll post on your site. Imagine not having to
worry=20
about infringing on copyrights because people have explicitly let you
use=20
their works. Imagine being able to search for music and sounds that you
can=20
freely toss into Flash pieces you've made. Or finding cool video shorts
you=20
can set your own music to, and post to your site.

There's the old saying that good artists copy and great artists steal,
and=20
that's not based on outright theft, but the acknowledgement that we are
all=20
influenced by other's work, and things like hip hop music and photoshop=20
collages point out how great new art can be created when combining other

works into new works.

To illustrate the point: there are more turntables sold today than
guitars.=20
People use both to create music, but what specifically do people do with

turntables? They play (usually) two previously released (and
copyrighted)=20
vinyl records, mixing them in various ways (scratching, layering, etc)
to=20
create new music works. I tend to think of "View Source" the same way. I

don't copy other's code and layouts outright, but I started learning=20
Cascading Style Sheets after sampling Zeldman's homepage in 1998. I
learned=20
javascript by copy and pasting rollover code people explicitly shared
with=20
the world. We all learned how to do layout tricks like tables, frames,
and=20
use of invisible gifs from looking at how others did their sites and=20
visually deconstructing their work. I can create pages with 3-column CSS

layouts today only because Eric Costello, Owen Briggs, and the=20
Bluerobot.com guy have done the legwork and shared their experiences
with=20
us all.

_What you get out of doing this_
If you take photographs, write stories, record music, or shoot films,
few=20
people are going to see your work and few-to-none will ever get a chance
to=20
share your work unless you've got your own lawyer that you can pay to
draft=20
up some explicit use terms. When I first started working on Creative=20
Commons a couple months ago, I viewed the site and the web application
as=20
"Lawyer-in-a-box." We're setting out to create an automatic way to
create=20
custom licenses that are tailored to your specific work, and it will
cost=20
you nothing. If you allow it in the terms, others can sample your works,

modify them, embed them in other things, or even sell them with your
name=20
attached. Everyone will have the opportunity to check out a vast supply
of=20
content that can be used in ways you used to have to ask people about
first.

_How I'm going to use it_
By this fall, the Creative Commons site should let you license (or
release=20
to the public domain) works of Audio, Video, Images, and Text. I'm
planning=20
on releasing all my personal photographs and essays under attribution,=20
noncommercial, and copyleft (all of the current ones are here, though
there=20
may be more by this fall:=20
http://creativecommons.org/technology/contributor.html#license )
licenses=20
so that personal web publishers can feel free to use my photos in their
art=20
projects, or reprint my stories in their non-commercial webzines. When
we=20
get to the point where software is being licensed, we might see a lot of

stuff similar to the GPL being released, and stuff like fonts that can
be=20
free for non-commercial use, but require you to contact and pay the
creator=20
of those fonts if you want to use them in commercial settings.

My mind is a bit fried from a recent conference and the site launch, so=20
this is only skimming the surface of the project and the benefits. If=20
anyone has any questions about it, feel free to shoot questions to me on
or=20
offlist.

THUNDERGULCH, the new media initiative of the Lower Manhattan Cultural
Council, is pleased to present "Database Cultures."  At the turn of the
century, the computer database has become the dominant storage system,
enabling a variety of networked individuals to organize, search,
retrieve, and display information about everything from chat-room gossip
to the outbreak of diseases in the country's hospitals. Organized by
guest curator, Wayne Ashley, five panelists discuss the challenges of
using a database as the generative engine behind their art work,
creating alternative systems that reveal the poetic, critical, and
community-building possibilities of manipulating and reconstituting
data. Speakers include Kevin and Jennifer McCoy, Mark Tribe, Brad Paley,
and J=E9r=F4me Sim=E9on.=20

_______________=20
S P E A K E R S:
=20
JENNIFER AND KEVIN MCCOY are new media artists. Their work plays upon
the capacity of new technology to fragment, store, and analyze audio and
video material. Resulting projects include installations, performances,
and net art that explore ideas of genre, interactivity, and automation.
Their work has been exhibited internationally. In New York they have
shown at P.S.1, Postmasters Gallery, The New Museum, and The Swiss
Institute.=20


W. BRADFORD PALEY is an artist and interaction designer whose goal in
both worlds is the visual interpretation of complex hidden phenomena. He
did his first photography in 1968, his first computer imagery in 1973,
and founded Digital Image Design Incorporated in 1982. He has shown at
the Museum of Modern Art, and his designs are at work every day in the
hands of brokers on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. He speaks
frequently on the subject of interaction design and pursues projects
where design inspires art and art informs the design.


MARK TRIBE is an artist and curator whose interests lie at the
intersection of emerging technologies and contemporary art. He is the
founder and executive director of Rhizome.org, an online platform for
the international new media art community. His latest art project,
Revelation 1.0 (commissioned by Amnesty International), looks at the
aesthetic armature of the Amnesty USA web site by stripping away its
text and graphics, leaving only blocks of color and photographic images.


J=C9R=D4ME SIM=C9ON is a researcher at Bell Labs, a division of Lucent
Technologies. He is a member of the Network Data and Services Research
Department. His research interests revolve structuring, storing, and
exchanging information over the Internet, XML, the Semantic Web, and
data  integration.=20

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

code and protocol: the parasitic vis-a-vis phenomenology of approach


among x and ~x = one inscribes the null set 0 as x^~x - intersection. but
x may be fuzzy; x may also be intended or unintended. if x is unintended,
or non-intended, then x may be protocol. consider roughly three strata:
a. unintended x-protocol: dna or crystal mapping, clays, lindenmayer
algorithms in relation to plant formation. b. intended x-protocol: tcp/
ip, jpeg compression, mpeg encoding, morse, ciphering. by 'intention,' a
reference _only_ to goal-oriented, teleological structuring. note that
intended x-protocols may be secondary-level coding (i.e. tcp/ip) or
primary-level (morse, bacon cipher); in the latter, the text is trans-
lated on a character-by-character basis into code, and in the former, the
text is carried by the code. at best this is a fuzzy distinction. note
that the latter is also an intended non-intended protocol; a better word
might be 'tended'; thus morse code is tended with key translation, but
tcp/ip is automated translation into packets (not into a 'tcp/ip code,'
but through ascii, well maybe the same thing). in intended distinction,
one might say (as one might say in tended non-intended protocol), that the
distinction is parasitic, that the element-between x and ~x - the inscrip-
tion itself - is the result of an intended act or sequence of acts. such
an element-between is dirty, abject, fuzzy, problematic, historically and
ideologically bound.

the element-between is the boundary-phenomena within the phenomenology of
approach; it marks/inscribes the totality of investigation, expenditure,
intention - as well as accompanying debris, and the heuristics necessary
to cleanse the phenomenon itself, [x, ~x].

it is within the element-between that -jectivity: projection/introjection,
plays out. it is from this element, represented as the inscribed boundary
x|~x, that anomaly overrides, that default tags arise. this is the chora-
tic element within the sememe, within semiosis, the generator of meaning,
and meaning's withdrawal.

it is here, {x} <> |P| <> {~x}, that the parasite is manifest - the noise
in the system that _tends towards meaning,_ towards the _maintenance_ of
the inscription. the parasite has everything to gain; as such it is also
_symbiotic_ in relation to x - retaining x for its own ends; the whole
process is an _enunciation._

I would also love to hear about this panel.  Originally I had planned to fly
down for it, but then I woke up and realized I was poor and getting poorer!
How does Avant Garde work in the book?  I tend to think of Avant Garde as a
historical term rolling forward from the modernist reinvestment of form
right up to Olson's form and content melding.  Molding.  Maulting.  Maybe.
Hey, it also has been attached to 'white male movements' like the Black
Mountain School, or more recently the language poetry gang.  Is it
investigated in the book or just adopted as a term to invoke connotations of
new/ radical/ experimental/ cutting edge/ {insert any other metaphor for
something that hasn't yet been dissected and pinned to a board}?  If at all
possible violent like butter.  These are not opinions.  Copyrighted for 2002
and back.  Now if the panel could be somehow digitally archived, then we
could all check it out and have a wonderful, maybe slightly provocative
discussion right here.  Here?  Or there.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe (silent
aich)I've gotten all the honey into my stockings and can't dance for seeing
the rain anymore.  This goes out, as all things, to you.  Rolling throught
the decades.  And what a war image!  It had specificity then and then and
why not maybe then as well.  Timeless like that first black and white kiss,
or was it sepia?

Yeah Wallace is into that term avant garde
And what of gloming E Dickinson onto it too?
(like that Annie Finch book "A Formal Feeling Comes"
which at least wasn't called "Formal Feeling Coming"
though the connection between formalism and the erotic....)
(or was he thinking of Ted Berrigan's CERTAIN SUN)
avant fin garde siecle a mobile army of meta fores
and the ING INGing////////                             here?
but that being said of my two fav. lang. pos only one is male

Is this the proper stance to take??? This is like saying that only blacks
can play at the Def Poetry Jam. People are drawn to a particular aestetic
and go with that. I don't wake up in the morning saying, gee I am a white
guy with blue eyes I must write Langpo -- yuck.

I have read Wallace's book and it is quite good. Cheers to him :-) And I
too have difficulty dealing with the term AvGde (see Jullich's wonderful
post on this issue months ago), but it is a distinct feeling that what is
happening is not a function of post modronism, drawn from but not dipped
in. Give the man a chance to speak before eagle-holing his work. I don't
like pidgeons.

Best, Geoffrey

Hi all,


This request comes to you from a non-list member, but from a good friend of
mine and fellow working-class academic in California.


She (Camille) is preparing to teach a class on philosophy and literature. She
is a philosophy professor and is looking for a reader or other source of
short stories, long poems, etc... with philosophical content or
ramifications... something that asks philosophical questions.
Any suggestions? We've already discussed "The Lottery" and "The Lorax" (by
Dr. Seuss). Neither one of us is particularly up to date on the lit. field.
Help? Bonus points for anything class-related!


Send suggestions directly to her or to the list (It might be interesting!) or
both.


Camille Atkinson, philoperros@onebox.com
Thanks!
rebekah

The Seattle Research Institute, a loose congerie of writers seeking to
fill the discursive gap between the City and the University, is planning a
second Public Text as a follow-up to Politics without the State.  The
topic is "Experimental Theology." A longer Call for Research follows.  For
more information about the SRI, see our website:
www.seattleresearchinstitute.org.


***

Call For Research on Experimental Theology


For its second Public Text, the Seattle Research Institute seeks
contributions on "Experimental Theology."  Derived from the name for the
preeminent academic discipline in Phillip Pullman's "The Golden Compass",
a marvelous novel for "young" adults in which the Catholic Church remains
in power and so thinking can only happen under the cloak of faith,
"Experimental Theology" names a nonexistent discipline, but one perhaps
very much needed now.  Theology is definitionally anti-experimental:  if
you come up with a different answer, you are a heretic, as professors at
Georgetown and Notre Dame know well. By the same token, to be experimental
is to operate without faith: a scientist with strong intuitions better be
one with tenure.  We think both these pictures, if not entirely wrong,
overstate their cases out of self-interest.  We could enumerate several
examples of experimental theology in our day--Walter Benjamin's dalliance
with messianism and the kabbalah in the service of the proletariat--but
the best image we can think of is Luther nailing his "theses" upon the
door of the church. We think Experimental Theology doesn't exist because
it has not been founded as a discipline.  While we don't aspire to
institutionalize it, we do want to solicit contributions that help explain
to us and others what Experimental Theology might be.

We welcome numinous essays, poetic experiments, fictive theologies, and
visual embodiments of the foregoing.  Completed submissions should be sent
by August 1, 2002 to sri@seattleresearchinstitute.org.

   Well, the incredibly obvious answer, and I'm just the dork to offer it,
is Wallace Stevens' longer poems.  And another fabulous chestnut, "Rameau's
Nephew" by Diderot.  They must be gathered in an anthology called Phil &
Lit: the Basics, somewhere.

a report on the telling it slant panel
dactyl foundation, NYC
friday may 19 2002

the proceedings began on fairly standard poetry time i.e. 30-40 minutes
late. mark wallace made brief opening comments regarding 1) the goals
and aspirations he and co-editor steven marks (who was unable to attend)
had in putting the book together, i.e. to gather a representative sample
of work from an even larger and ongoing dialogue, and 2) the idea behind
the panel, which by eschewing the academic standard three twenty-minute
presentations and limited Q&A in favor of more numerous short
presentations and longer Q&A would hopefully encourage and extend
dialogue among a variety of voices. he then introduced the panelists,
who went in alphabetical order.

charles borkhuis described coming to poetry in the late eighties
primarily through experimental theater and finding the poetry scene
rather factionalized. recognizing and working at what he calls a nexus
of late surrealism and textual poetry became a way of creating and
observing a metaphysical car crash, a writing one's way out of factions
in order to gain some breathing space.

sherry brennan cited the writing from the new coast conference of 1993
as her entry point into the field, particularly from pennsylvania where
she otherwise did not have much access. she read a portion of an essay
different from the one in the book, regarding a poetics of the body,
language as the shape of things, and the avant garde not as a school or
form but a life practice.

jeff derksen extended the critique of globalization and official
multiculturalism made by his essay in the book to the new post-9/11
landscape, or rather the post-10/17 landscape (the intiation date, i
think, of the FBI and justice department "interviews" of arab-american
men). he questioned the role of the avant garde in the current culture
of critical production.

jeff hansen spoke of what he calls the embodied poem, which revises the
olsonian notion of the poem as a high-energy construct and applies it to
a post-humanist, non (male) egocentric context. he read a few stanzas
from heather fuller's poem "telegram" (from _perhaps this is a rescue
fantasy_) to illustrate.

bill howe spoke to language poetry's attention to the word and phoneme
as opening up a number of different directions for poetry to then
pursue, literally in a pragmatic sense of what can i do with this. such
directions include performative and verbovisual poetries as well as a
renewed interest in the self or subject.

andrew levy discussed the work of michael amnasan, a bay-area poet whose
book from krupskaya very much takes up issues of class in relation to
avant garde poetry. andy read from steven farmer's review of the amnasan
book that he published in his journal _crayon_, their (levy's and
farmer's) claim being that the avant garde often fails to recognize let
alone address social inequities.

eileen myles offered an historical, personal and cultural perspective,
beginning with the odd feeling she had at being invited to address the
poetry of the 1990s: even tho she had been writing for many years prior
she felt that she really has come into her own as a poet in the 1990s.
she described the avant garde as being a situation of friendship, a
place where people can come together. poetry of the sixties: free love
and drugs; of the seventies: formalized excess; of the eighties: a
choice between rock star and performance poetry, no one really wanting
the mantle of poetry let alone creating a discourse about it; of the
nineties: poetry is needed again, as exempliefied at a post-9/11 reading
at the project where poets came together even tho many admitted to not
writing anything since then.

leonard schwartz spoke of avant garde poetry building structures for
survival. he discussed and read from an essay by andrew joron entitled
"the emergency of poetry" that discusses the (in)efficacies of poetry
especially post-9/11.

juliana spahr opted not to make a presentation.

brian kim stefans touched briefly on several different threads: the
general uniformity of prose styles in telling it slant (with exceptions
of course), the unusual (and belated) frequency with which theresa cha's
work is discussed in telling it slant, the extent to which digital
poetries still need greater practical and critical discourse, and the
extent to which lively controversies like those that surrounded apex of
the m and fence no longer seem to catch people's interest.

gary sullivan discussed the work of daniel davidson, whose collected
poems he has just finished editing for krupskaya. davidson was a bay-
area poet from the mid80s-mid90s who was plagued with health problems
and living on a fixed income before he took his own life. gary discussed
the difficulties of davidson's life as they were manifested in his
friendships and found their way into his poetry.

lee ann brown read some haiku-like poems from a notebook she was keeping
on her trip to japan from which she had literally just returned.

douglas rothschild began the Q&A by asking if he could light the room on
fire, and mark replied that that was something he preferred douglas
would do later. douglas then said he wanted to light the room on fire
with a question, namely why, with a few notable exceptions, the book and
the panel were so white. much discussion ensued, the basic tenor of
which i think of as involving the fact that the avant garde like any
cultural production can hardly escape the conditions (i.e. disparities,
inequities, injustices) of the culture in which it finds itself, by
nature probably tends to replicate them, but at the very least can
maintain and insist on an awareness of such conditions and perhaps offer
a space for interrogating them. discussion then turned to the use of the
term avant garde: the questioner felt that this was a term that in art
circles at least was quite dead in the 1970s and yet here it turns up in
poetry of the nineties. the difficulty of terms and their varied and
problematic implications was taken up, as well as the difficulty in
transferring terms between different arts and disciplines.

beyond the thirteen panelists i'd say there were about forty people in
attendance. i hope readers will correct any omissions or inaccuracies
i've inadvertantly made here.

Thanks, Tom, for the overview. I should say though that I didn't edit Dan's
book -- I just wrote the afterword, of which the talk was an edited version.
The kind people at Krupskaya -- Kevin Killian, Jocelyn Saidenberg, and Dan
Farrell -- did all the real work!

this got bounced back to me, along w/ several other messages i know went
through.  so apologies if this is a repeat:  subject heading was "book
review opportunities"

dear friends:
a pretty remarkable ugrad here, who is blind and deaf, has a press called
the tactile mind.  he's bringing out two books and asked me if i wd spread
the word about reviews etc.  Here is an excerpt from his email note
containing the web info about the books and a brief description of one of
them:

"Perhaps you
would like to read SILENCE IS A FOUR-LETTER WORD: ON ART & DEAFNESS?
 Raymond Luczak uses four genres in that book -- a short story, 111
mini-essays, a play, and a self-interview -- to make his points on what
makes art "art" and deafness "deaf." ...  We have the flyer for the two
books on-line at http://www.thetactilemind.com/flyer.pdf  -- let me know if
you have any problems with reading it in that format.  You should also
direct your contacts to the main page at www.thetactilemind.com, which will
lead to the books' pages, which in turn will lead to excerpts on-line and
to the author's web site."

I haven't looked at the site myself, but imagine there's contact info for
him to send you review copies.  if not, let me know and i'll pass on his
contact info to you.

-Chicago Review- 47:4/48:1
Stan Brakhage: Correspondences
Edited by Eirik Steinhoff, et. al.
(Chicago Review, 277 pp., $8.00, Paper (Original))

Brakhage's abandonment of conventional linear narrative and the
traditional use of characters has made Brakhage one of the most
challenging and rewarding experimental filmmakers. Not only do
Brakhage's films ultimately change the way we look at filmic images but
they also transform the way we see. Chicago was recently the beneficiary
of a mini-Brakhage festival and the remarkable new issue of the Chicago
Review, dedicated to his work, served as an essential companion. As it
turns out, Brakhage's visual gift and ambitions are matched by his
thought-provoking writings on film and poetry. This issue includes his
writings on aesthetics, film technique, and an account of a comical
meeting with Andrei Tarkovsky. Brakhage's interest in American
experimental poetry (of the Pound/Olson/Stein variety) led him to a
series of correspondence with such poets as Charles Olson, Robert
Duncan, and Ronald Johnson. In his letters, Brakhage's ebullient
personality shines through -- he is chatty, insightful and eager to
discuss personal plans, poetry, or his own cinematic aesthetics. Stan
Brakhage Correspondences includes essays from leading Brakhage scholars,
covering over four decades of his work and focusing on his overall
project and individual films. There is also an essay from Guy Davenport
and a poetic tribute/meditation/critique from poet Robert Kelly. The
critical essays perfectly complement Brakhage's own writings and present
a range of new perspectives on his cinematic ambitions and
accomplishments. Not to be missed.

One final note: this issue also includes the Chicago Review=92s usual
impressive fiction, poetry, and criticism, including works from Rosmarie
Waldrop, Jean Cocteau, Paul Hoover, and Anthony Doerr.

Digital Sensations: Space, Identity, and Embodiment in Virtual Reality by
Ken Hillis, University of Minnesota Press (October 1999, 248 Pages, 5
black-and-white photos, 2 figures IS AVAILABLE!!)

"Digital Sensations is the best critique of virtual reality's implications
we now have. Rather than breathlessly celebrating the limitless digital
future, Hillis carefully explores its continuities with certain earlier
tendencies in Western culture and shows their common dangers." --Martin
Jay--

Virtual reality is in the news and in the movies, on TV and in the air.
Why is the technology--or the idea of the technology--so prevalent
precisely now? What does it mean--what does it do--to us? Digital
Sensations looks closely at the ways representational forms generated by
communication technologies--especially digital/optical virtual
technologies--affect the "lived" world.

Virtual reality, or VR, is a technological reproduction of the process of
perceiving the real; yet that process is "filtered" through the social
realities and embedded cultural assumptions about human bodies,
perception, and space held by the technology's creators.

Through critical histories of the technology--of vision, light, space, and
embodiment--Digital Sensations traces the various and often contradictory
intellectual and metaphysical impulses behind the Western transcendental
wish to achieve an ever more perfect copy of the real. Because virtual
technologies are new, these histories also address the often unintended
and underconsidered consequences--such as alienating new forms of
surveilance and commodification--flowing from their rapid dissemination.
Current and proposed virtual technologies refelct a Western desire to
escape the body.

Exploring topics from VR and other earlier visual technologies, Digital
Sensations' penetrative perspective on the cultural power of place and
space broadens our view of the interplay between social relations and
technology.

"His discussion is ambitious; not only does he bring together multiple
disciplines and philosophies, he traces history from the Renaissance to
the present." [Technical Communication Quarterly]

Ken Hillis has written a wise interrogation of the impact of virtual
environments and the marriage of new digital and visual technologies.
Carefully balancing between the dangers of all-too-common and too-easy
skepticism and the risk of being seduced by the new medium, this book
analyses the manner in which the use of technologies to produce virtual
environments (VEs) changes the bases on which assumptions concerning
democratic politics and identity flourish." Space and Culture

Ken Hillis received his Ph.D. in Human Geography from the University of
Wisconsin at Madison in May, 1996. His dissertation -- Geography, Identity
and Embodiment in Virtual Reality -- looked at Information Technologies
(IT), new media, and more specifically at Virtual Reality (VR). He argued
the importance of distinguishing the technologies that collectively
constitute the "platform" that individuals rely on to "enter" virtual
environments from these environments or "worlds" in and of themselves.

((Ken Hillis is assistant professor in the Department of Communication
Studies and adjunct professor of geography at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill.))

         Subject: Writing Machines

A new book, "Writing Machines" (November 2002, ISBN 0-262-08311-6) SERIES:
Mediaworks Pamphlets by N. Katherine Hayles and Designed by Anne Burdick
is available!

Tracing a journey from the 1950s through the 1990s, N. Katherine Hayles
uses the autobiographical persona of Kaye to explore how literature has
transformed itself from inscriptions rendered as the flat durable marks of
print to the dynamic images of CRT screens, from verbal texts to the
diverse sensory modalities of multimedia works, from books to technotexts.

Weaving together Kaye.s pseudo-autobiographical narrative with a
theorization of contemporary literature in media-specific terms, Hayles
examines the ways in which literary texts in every genre and period mutate
as they are reconceived and rewritten for electronic formats. As
electronic documents become more pervasive, print appears not as the sea
in which we swim, transparent because we are so accustomed to its
conventions, but rather as a medium with its own assumptions,
specificities, and inscription practices. Hayles explores works that focus
on the very inscription technologies that produce them, examining three
writing machines in depth: Talan Memmott.s groundbreaking electronic work
Lexia to Perplexia, Mark Z. Danielewski.s cult postprint novel House of
Leaves, and Tom Phillips.s artist.s book A Humument. Hayles concludes by
speculating on how technotexts affect the development of contemporary
subjectivity.

Writing Machines is the second volume in the Mediawork Pamphlets series.

Trawling through the archive
(as more a lurker than an active member of this list)
I picked up this thread on "nature poetry"
running about a month back

Re im/morality of Nature Poetry

& would just like to note that the current issue of
ECOPOETICS

addresses exactly the issues tossed about
vis-=E0-vis bulldozers, flowers & other species, in/digeneity,
and possibilities for urban-oriented, historically and socially aware
nature writing

For example, the "centerfold" is a seven-page essay
by Robert Grenier, that begins
"Nature poetry is BORING"

But there's also Brenda Coultas on the Bowery
as fin-de-si=E8cle Walden

Kenneth Goldsmith on the virtues of "paving the Earth"

Mike Kelleher's sheep-shagging "Pastoral"

Nick Lawrence's review of Lisa Robertson's The Weather

A long interview with Cecilia Vicu=F1a
on seeds, art and politics in Chile, and talking to animals
with new work by Cecilia . . .

Kevin Killian's Hawaii piece, "Kona Spray Ad Campaign"

Robert Kocik's "Annotated List of Missing Social Services and Omitted
Agencies" (a substantial excerpt from Overcoming Fitness)

-- if you want to take on the "immorality" of mainstream nature writing,
Kocik is WAY ahead of the curve.

And MUCH, much more . . . check it out.

You can also check out Joel Kuzsai's review of ECOPOETICS 01
posted to this list on the 12th of May (thanks, Joel!)

A run of 400; at least a hundred gone and I already have a LOT of people to
send them to, so get yours while they last!

The Capilano Review special issue on Grief / War / Poetics

Literary and visuals arts journal, The Capilano Review has collected a =
range of timely work from Canadian and U.S. poets and prose writers in =
response to a unique call for submissions on "war, grief, and poetics in =
a post 9/11 context". The unprecedented issue brings together creative =
and probing texts that reveal the initial attempts of artists to =
integrate cultural and political implications with their creative =
processes.
   Released in April 2002 the issue sells for $9 and can be found in =
independent Vancouver bookstores and in stores of the Indigo/Chapters =
chain across Canada. Issues can also be purchased by mailing a cheque =
for $9 to: The Capilano Review, 2055 Purcell Way, North Vancouver, BC =
V7J 3H5 or via email at tcr@capcollege.bc.ca (for foreign orders, prices =
in U.S. funds).
Contributions include:
. Family issues of care interlace with world tragedy in Renee Rodin's =
memoir of September 11 and her consequent visit to see her sons in New =
York.
. Structures of cause and effect are interrogated in Alexandra Chasin's =
diagrammatic "A Grammar of Guilt".
. Chair of the B.C. Civil Liberties Society, John Dixon assesses the =
impact of Canadian reaction to Sunera Thobani's conference speech.
. "The Empire of Grief" by Adeena Karasick presents a compendium of =
words and phrases whose meanings shift in the debris:
And, i'm rememberin'
when "Red Alert"
referred to a Macy's Sale, when camouflage bedwear
was strong, sexy and designed to arouse the invasion of
allied forces. Remember
when 'laden flew a flying carpet
It's a whole new war...
. Alan Sondheim's "United States Postal Service" conducts a paranoic =
self-interrogation about suspicious mail.
. Reconstructed assemblage art by Al Neil and assisted by Carole Itter =
is featured in the full-colour visual art section.

Here is a poem by Antonio Porta that I just translated for a friend.

Bill


This morning the radio: there are already
enough bombs for 250,000 Hiroshimas
but the danger is not imminent.
Tell me, how can a poet be loved?
I remember well, it was Musil who wrote,
"this is the first age in history
that does not love its poets."
In these days many ask me for poetry,
what good motive there needs to be.

Subject:      further thoughts on telling it slant
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

hello all,

since my report on the telling it slant panel was rather (as some folks
have pointed out to me backchannel) objective, neutral, and even made
the whole proceedings and/or the book sound boring, they very much
were/are not and i thought i'd follow up with something less objective
and hopefully less boring-sounding.

to its credit, the format enabled a variety of voices, perspectives, and
approaches to be registered. in an academic conference setting, i tend
to hope that at least one of the three 20-minute read-verbatim-off-the-
page papers will spark my curiosity and that i won't feel at the end
like a full hour of my time has been wasted by people who aren't telling
us anything we don't already know or could easily enough find out for
ourselves. the format encouraged a variety of pre-written or
extemporized statements (or some combination thereof), theoretical
stances or readings of other poets, and everything in between. so even
the movement between the different approaches each person took was worth
attending to. as well as the fact that when presentations did overlap,
the presenters themselves were able to incorporate those connections on
the spot (say, andrew levy picking up on jeff derksen) rather than leave
it to the authority of the panel chair or moderator to elicit or tie
together such threads.

the format's inherent shortcoming of course is that with the numerous
short presentations it's hard as an audience member (for me at any rate)
to come away with something on which i can comfortably or resolutely
hang my hat. i mean i think that's partly the point, that there is not
some grand statement or synthesis, some single position or bone to gnaw
on as you walk away. and i'm inclined to think that this may be
emblematic of what's both exciting and frustrating about the kind of
refusals that seem to have become definitional to the decade and the
generation that has come of age in it (the refusal of identities,
factions, singularities of practice, etc).

what i found most useful were the presentations that (and this is
perhaps something of a paradox) on the one hand turned me on to
something new and on the other hand addressed what i wanted to hear.
(between these two i'd have to place a third category of stuff that
didn't necessarily tell me anything new but was nevertheless good for me
to hear again and/or in a new context, examples of which would be jeff
derksen's talk, jeff hansen's reading of the heather fuller poem, etc.)

what turned me on to somethng new was, for example, andy levy's
discussion of michael amnasan's work, gary sullivan's discussion of
daniel davidson's work, lee ann brown's new poems. what i wanted to
hear, what i'm always interested to hear, is how and when people came to
this work and what it was like then and how it's different now. sherry
brennan and charles borkhuis touched on this, but eileen myles really
delivered for me in this respect. she's simply a brilliant extemporiser:
her thought moves and spins and cuts and comes back in ways that are
really fascinating to watch and hear. her talk was the most exemplary
articulation of what i've always held raymond williams to mean by his
phrase "structure of feeling": the way that individual and group affect
is both enabled and constrained by social, material, and economic
conditions. from her sense of the avant garde as a site of friendship
and a place where people can come together, she explained how the
different decades embodied different dispositions toward and expressions
of poetry and the avant garde in a really compelling way.

i think the other presentation that touched on what i wanted to hear
was that of brian kim stefans, on the issue of what i guess i would call
the current level of discourse operating in and around our current
poetry. brian mentioned the fact that people seem to have lost interest
in or the energy for the kinds of discussions surrounding, for example,
apex of the m and fence. and i suppose this is both fortunate and
unfortunate because on the one hand such controveries have tended to
raise all kinds of animosities and rancors, but on the other hand they
clearly involved issues that people cared enough about and were invested
enough in to want to engage in serious debate in the first place.

i think the problem here comes down to two interrelated factors: the
level of discourse we can engage in and the amount of energy with which
one can engage. cynics and pacifists will perhaps always bemoan the
poetry wars and cite how little they all mean in the grand scheme of
things beyond our little worlds of poetry. and i'm certainly not
suggesting everyone take off the gloves and have a go at each other
either. but i think there's presently a kind of disinclination to 1) air
out issues and differences 2) at a level of discourse in which
thoughtful understandings can be shared. and i don't know how to account
for this except to say that i think part of it has to do with energy, of
which i often don't have enough myself.

but i do see the telling it slant book and panel as both offering very
promising impetuses for putting up some stakes and exchanging some real
discussion. i know between readings at double happiness the following
day people were talking about the panel and i hope the talk continues...

Bill,

Good gracious, I thought you meant 'porta poem" like "porta potty." That was
confusing.  But the poem is great.

Speaking of great translations, I recommend the Darwish poems in the
Spring/Summer Fence Magazine Inc.  Wow-- and i see a collection of them is
due out from U. Cali press this fall.  Among the last books of poetry from
that estimable publisher?

"Craquer, an essay on class" by Camille Roy, new from Second Story Books.
Available from Small Press Distribution, http://www.spdbooks.org

In a compelling essay-autobiography-narrative, Roy makes a spirited
reconciliation with the accidents and secrets of family
circumstance.  40 pages, hand bound.

"Who hasn't been lied to, constantly? Viewed from another angle, it's
a gift. I remember Pearl, eyeing me after a few vodkas with the
closest thing that she possessed to wickedness, You-she snapped-can
write. You're like your father. I just can't. Then stalking off into
the remainder of her mysterious evening.
Pearl's stories pulsed with  desire, fantasy, and dread. They became
me. Then they blurred, disappeared. I live in the aftermath. The
snag, its lingering disturbance, feels muscular. It resides there, as
I shove one foot ahead of the other, in all the sites of  pleasure
and aggression, intact as my confidence."

Thanks. I see that I was thinking of "It will publish dramatically less
literature and far fewer works of literary theory," which does not
necessarily imply the end of the poetry series.

The Flood & The Garden - a daybook
by Dale Smith
ISBN 1-889960-07-1, paper, perfectbound, 106 pps, $12

“I was astonished and completely absorbed in Dale's new book. It's deeply
beautiful, the domesticity, the friendships, the ranting, the quality of
detail, the resonant tenderness of his sentences. It gleams. Reminds me much
of Basho's haibun, except the journey isn't in distance so much as it is in
time. The time it takes for conception, a time in friendship and reading and
arguing and gestures of love and lust. It's so lustrous in its clarity it is
as though he had fallen off a cliff and with his heart in his mouth glimpsed
each of these moments in a slow motion exactness, the sequence of bathetic
experiences that make up the meaning of a life.”

1. Last email I wrote: "It is the classic avant-garde strategy, faced with
the question of lineage and influence, to assert a new poetry moment without
poetics parallel." I’d like to take this back, as I am re-stating and
expanding it into a new thread somewhat separate from my reading of Chris’s
work (even though it will stil figure there -- but re-written).

2. Chris, I am mulling over your questions. I feel they are good just there,
unanswered (but, not forgotten by me). Here I just want to say, in case it’s
not obvious, that anyone should feel invited to respond to them, I hope -- I
certainly don’t think of them as exclusively addressed to moi.

3. Bill, I wonder about the last crucial line,

“what good motive there needs to be.”

for

“qualche motivo buono ci deve essere.”

Of all the lines in the poem, the tone for this last seems most difficult to
interpret let alone translate. Is he referring to his own motivations for
giving out his poems, or to the motivations of those who are asking for
them? If the latter, is he being sarcastic (given that no one loves poets,
the motives for any request for poems are highly suspect) or genuine (no one
loves poets, yet everyone loves poetry -- what’s going on?)? I’m wondering
if you were playing with other English variants, even as it seems that you
have very little wiggle-room in the Italian.

First of all, Fakelangpo is now now accessible from the easy to remember URL
www.sporkworld.org/fakelangpo.html.  This is just a page which gives you a
link to go to the real fakelangpo page, but you should use it since I
reserve the right to chnage the other link (if I chnage content management
systems) and I may post occasional news or warnings on this front page.

Secondly, we have a new poem of great accomplishment (what kind of
accomplishment is left up to you...it may be real...or fake...or a failed
attempt at either...discussion on the site is always welcome!) called "3
Encounters.  I hope you will enjoy the humorous button from which you call
up this poem.  You will have to read the poem carefully to find its
inspiration.

Thirdly, fakelangpo still seeks submissions for the site of poetry (or
related web art), real or fake, by real or fake poets, who may themselves be
real or fake.  Indiuvidual poems are welcome but collections (links to a
personal home page where you have poems perhaps) are particularly sought
out.

We also seek, in a more serious vein,  essays on Language poetry
(specifically, what is it IN THE POEM that makes it a language poem,
assuming you didn't know who the author was and didn't know if the poem was
connected to te L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E mqanifesto)? what little-known language
poets are there? or poets who write like language poets but aren't in the in
group so aren't considered LPs even though their style is similar?).

Another need is humorous/fake manfesti on the theory of fakelangpo which of
course is based on being fun-to-read Language poetry, and by extension,
advanced/avant garde/experimental/academic/serious/innovative poetry which
is fun to read.  In other genres of poetry, it is a given that the poems
must be pleasing (eg New Formalism) but in the most "exciting" new poetry,
sometimes actually entertaining the reader is forgotten...  does this have
to be so?  Or is it a case of the reader needing to catch up to the state of
the art, like the people who couldn't understand or be entertained by the
Cubists when their paintings first came out?

FINALLY, the real hope os that there will begin to be some discussion on the
site.  This site's existence has generated some discussion here (mostly
anger at how dare I make fun of the Language Poets, which incidentally, I'm
not & as I keep saying I enjoy their work, and find the best of it fun to
read in the fakelangpo sense .... but not because of the theory or because
of who wrote them but because of the intrinsic textual qualities of the
poems themselves).  I would hope that anyone else who is angry at it would
take their comments to the site itself, along with other people who want to
discuss the various areas of interest that the site prmotes.  It's actyually
an effort to promote a focused discussion of poetics and specific poems
both, through humor but for serious purpose ultimately.

Admittedly the translation is a little awkward.  Perhaps a translation that
relies less on his specific language would be more appropriate.  This
translation was a quick one, but I did think of other versions for the last
line, although I could not come up with anything quickly.  Phrases like
"there needs to be some good motive" don't seem much better.

As for the motivation for the line, I take it as a mix of genuine and
sarcastic.  The need is genuine on the poet's part, i.e. there needs to be
poetry, especially in our period.  This need is also true for the ones
asking for poetry; however, there is a note of sarcasm, perhaps irony is a
better word for what I mean, since no one loves poets.  In a more extended
interpretation, poetry is a balance or a contrast to the language on the
radio that states that the danger is not imminent.  But perhaps I am
interpreting this poem under the shadow of his poem ("educare al razionale .
. .") about poetry helping one to interrogate language.

How would you translate the line?

yes, I, too, have walked past the toiled glare of tese places -- The
Limited, T. J. Maxx, (also STRUCTURE)...and have found passages
enlightening, compressed meanings, coming in suddenness...a flash of glitz
at those who are to be instructed. such a concentration! such a meaning!

LIFELINE FOR ONE PUBLISHER MEANS POTENTIAL DEATH KNELL FOR MANY PUBLISHERS

For immediate release
Toronto, May 23, 2002

While the decision reached in the Ontario courts yesterday may have
offered a lifeline to Jack Stoddart and his beleaguered General
Publishing, Canadian publishers affected by this decision suggest that it
may spell a death knell for many of them.

More than 40 Canadian and US publishers spent the last week in court
arguing that they owned the receivables for books invoiced on their behalf
by General Distribution Services (GDS). Judge Ground ruled otherwise
yesterday, paving the way for restructuring at General and removing any
hope that publishers would collect very much of the $6.5 million owed to
them by General Publishing and its many subsidiaries.

While General Publishing’s Jack Stoddart remarked that the upshot of Judge
Ground’s decision is that "authors, booksellers, employees and publishers"
are the winners, publishers are doubtful that this decision will spell
good news for anyone but the Bank of Nova Scotia and Jack Stoddart
himself.

The GDS receivables, estimated at about $18 million, are pledged first to
the Bank of Nova Scotia, and then to Jack Stoddart (chairman of GDS), (who
together are owed more than $20 million) followed by a list of other
secured and unsecured creditors. Despite Stoddart’s assurances, publishers
are doubtful that they or the authors will realize much of the more than
$13 million owed in "unsecured" receivables.

"After the Bank gets its money, and Jack Stoddart collects his pay-out, I
doubt there will be very much left for the other unsecured creditors,"
said Jack David, co-owner of ECW Press and a member of the Literary Press
Group of Canada (LPG) and the Association of Canadian Publishers (ACP).
"The ruling yesterday puts us at the bottom of a long list, and I don’t
expect to see a dime."

It is estimated that, of the $13.3 million owed to General’s client
publishers, more than $3 million is owed to about 50 unsecured Canadian
publishers, many of them small literary publishers that discover much of
the writing talent in Canada. The debt represents several months of
domestic book sales, including from the fall and holiday seasons, by far
the most important selling season. Many of the publishers use GDS for U.S.
sales as well and haven’t been paid for these sales for almost a year.

For publishers such as Véhicule Press and McGill-Queen’s University Press
in Montreal, Porcupine’s Quill and ECW Press in Toronto, Goose Lane
Editions in Fredericton, Coteau in Saskatoon, New Star Books in Vancouver,
and many others, the failure of the courts to recognize the publishers’
ownership of receivables is dispiriting.

After a booming fall season, Canadian publishers had expected that their
revenue from fall sales would propel them through the spring and summer of
2002. Unfortunately, they will now have to wait months before they collect
anything from General, and, even then, it will probably be a small
fraction of what is owed to them from the sale of their books, if
anything. Most of them now expect that revenue from fall sales will
all-but-disappear.

Unlike many GDS creditors, publishers now face the prospect of having no
income for many months to come.

"As publishers, we are most at risk among all the unsecured creditors,"
said Jack David. "We depend on our distributor to collect most of our
earned revenue from our customers, the bookstores. For other unsecured
creditors, such as the phone or courier companies, it’s just one bad
account."

At the same time, the courts have prevented many publishers from
terminating their contracts with GDS or removing their inventory from the
GDS warehouse. They take cold comfort in the new "trust" accounts
established by GDS for revenue generated by new sales, which do not appear
to be beyond the reach of the bank or Stoddart himself.

"The only thing that yesterday’s ruling determined, said Jack David, "is
that the Bank of Nova Scotia will increase its profits, and some Canadian
publishers will be driven out of business."

For more information, please contact David Caron, executive director of
the LPG at 416-483-1321, or Monique Smith, executive director of the ACP
at 416-487-6116.

I am with you Aaron. Though I don't think joining the bohemians is something
a bohemian would do-- unless you mean to suggest the Bohemian Club? In which
case, I would hazard to assume, we are, due to our combined lack of power,
money and prestige, less than ideal candidates.

(If you'd made that trip to San Francisco we could have wandered our way to
the Bohemian Men's Club, (is it still called that-- A Men's Club?) next to
Grace Cathedral and The Fairmont Hotel, on one of the more beatific avenues
of the city.)

One interesting book on Boheme is _Bohemian versus bourgeois_ by Cesar
Grana. Cesar, I seem to think/recall, was a professor at UC Berkeley. I wish
I could find that book again. I've actually searched for it on-line and come
up surprisingly empty. It was published by Basic Books, 1964. If anyone has
a lead, or has read the thing, so as to rescue me from its mirage, I would
appreciate a holler.

If you want to join something, though, I'd suggest the Rosicrucians, who
have their faux Egyptian-like headquarters down in the sunny suburban sprawl
of San Jose, CA. I don't know that much about the Rosy Cross, but I think
there's a fee to join, after that who knows...

Rosicrucians' web site:

http://home.att.net/~ag2kh/rosicrua.htm

I stand shame faced and corrected. I've just located a web site in which you
can join the *New Bohemians,* all this and a gift shoppe to boot:

http://www.newbohemian.com/


Well, I think that is enough empty purposeless damage for now. I will resume
my lurker status beneath this cyber soil, this bohemian ether.

Guten Tag,

Andrew

Good granola clusters, Felsinger, you're right!!  And it's a school of
poetry to boot! http://www.newbohemian.com/cafe.shtml

The poetry itself--

   I woke up in the morning. Had to find my way back home.
   By the time evening fell, I realised where I belonged.
   I was lost to the night, to the night.
   I looked for the sun rise, But was blinded by the dawn.

   ["Lost to the Night" by A.Y.U.]

--is actually kind of great. The idea of scanning the sky for the sunrise
only to be *suddenly blinded* reminds us that it might, after all, be better
to remain ... "lost to the night."  Yet lest we become too comfortable
there--

   Hoping, dreaming,
   but only being pulled down into
   the abyss of
   depression... desperation...
   degeneration...

Strength in numbers, though, Andrew.  We have our wits, our youth, and the
internet. And don't forget the power of patchouli. It's good to have you

Aaron and Andrew don't mention there is a  Recipes link.

These folks are not true bohemians, though.  They use the "L" word.  For
"libertarian".  Progressive, schmezzive.  True (new or not) bohemians are
too decadent for politics.  There is whiff of CPU to this site.

"You made a mistake, you did something wrong.
 Now make another mistake, and do something right."

Somebody on the list had asked where these lines came from, which appear on some of my posts.  The earliest I know of them is the El Saturn LP from 1977, number 7877, where it appears under the title "You Made a Mistake."  I KNOW it appears on a more recent CD, but haven't been able to locate it among the many in my collection because it's part of one of those extended chant sessions the Arkestra favored, and is thus not separately IDed on the track listings.  If you have acces to a copy of THE EARTHLY RECORDINGS OF SUN RA, it may be cross-indexed there.

The netiquette is that postings to individuals are private and should not be
repeated.  Postings to lists and newsgroups are public and may be repeated
wherever--the source of much misinformation and many hoaxes.  Not in this case.

"Stanford researchers establish link between creative genius and mental illness
STANFORD, Calif. - For decades, scientists have known that eminently creative individuals have a much higher rate of manic depression, or bipolar disorder, than does the general population. But few controlled studies have been done to build the link between mental illness and creativity. Now, Stanford researchers Connie Strong and Terence Ketter, MD, have taken the first steps toward exploring the relationship.

Using personality and temperament tests, they found healthy artists to be more similar in personality to individuals with manic depression than to healthy people in the general population. "My hunch is that emotional range, having an emotional broadband, is the bipolar patient's advantage," said Strong. "It isn't the only thing going on, but something gives people with manic depression an edge, and I think it's emotional range."

Poets shouldnt care about publishing: we should just write and create. And
enjoy the process. Art!! Long live great pricelseess art! Earn money
elsewise...Who cares who reads it if any..count ot a bonus if someone gets
something from your work...learn to fail..this obsession with fame and
whether books get published. There are probably too many books already...
the greatest writers are almost always neglected anycase: if you sell any
books your probably no good as a writer: or your writing tripe: pulpable
crap (or is that culpable pap?)... Richard.

And now for the sequel: "Son of Bad Science!"

Who knows? Maybe creativity drives people crazy. Hide the pens and papers,
and for heaven's sake don't let your kids fingerpaint.

Seriously, there are serious diagnoses out there, but most are pretty
haphazard. I've rescued quite a few from the latter. So  there's the
inevitable question,  how do you form a sample? To put it another
way,  "who you calling crazy?" (not you, Tom, those folks nwasting
perfectly good grant money.)

would a corporate lawyer be satisfied with working the night shift in a
factory so long as it meant she could practise law on the weekends?  with
constant loss of sleep for her ART?  sure ideally we all want the utopic
situation art just is and we're all bohemian sure.  vacuum selling for the
sake of vacuum selling for the sake of selling in general.  long live the
love.  an illustrious balloon with the words head inside typed in brilliant
green.  i agree, learn to fail.  operate in the face of nothingness.
great.  why have arts funding at all?  why have publishing houses at all?  a
nation of workers or a nation of workers.  sounds humbling.  practice that
radiocardiology on the weekends sir, today you must write poems and create
mind-numbing performances or you will starve.  if you prefer to starve,
well...  if you believe it shouldn't matter...  while we're at it, kill all
wildlife.  bomb the middle of nowhere.  pave the rivers.  part the airwaves
and stop all that bloody rock and roll if it is making any  money.  to rant,
oh.  encoding the whole mess of the Big C into hobbyist endevours like mud

Sorry always (twice, now)to be arguing with you, but leaving aside the
question of earning money, which could be a different debate,  I fail to see
how one separates the process of  reading and writing

People who write poetry without reading it are, almost without exception a
waste of space - as Martin Stannard remarks (facetiously) "It's more
interesting than that stuff in books that's difficult to understand" (_Words
Out Loud_, Stride Books,UK)

I would  have thought that your  presence here contradicts what you are
saying, unless your interest in  poetry is mainly one of talking about
poetry

Who cares? may be a useful manner to cultivate as an emotional protection;
but not as a manifesto for not publication

Fame is not the same as getting a book published. Earning money is not the
best reason for publishing.

Poetry is a communal activity

Hey, why bother with the fake stuff when you can now read the real thing! A
new edition of -In The American Tree- edited by Ron Silliman is out from The
National Poetry Foundation. 607 pages, all new bio notes. So skip the
puerile imitations and sink your teeth into the challenging work that made
the experimental writing of the 70's and 80's the in thing to awkwardly
imitate in the not-that-new millenium. Nice editor photo on the back cover
too!

Sorry this has grown into a a missive and a caposule auutobiography (well, I
am working on a memoir but it's a damn siight more artful than this...) but
i wanted to explain what it's like to have serious manic depression and why
it is incompatible with being a great artist usually.  I don't think I would
have been a _great_ anything, although I did get into Princeton for Math
grad school, so I had reached the top of school as an undergrad, and that
was my highest achievmment because i was never able to do math after my
vbreakdown.  I also now to web art and writing (more web stuff lately).  I
admire people's major projects, but I know that I could never get one done
between  episodes of illness, so I doi a lot of little tihings: a single
animated poem (see www.sporkworld.org/webart/rhino.html) a short hypertext
poem (www.sporkworld.org/subway/poemtitle.html) and numeours shourt
animations (see my work on www.bannerart.org under banners and rectangular
IMUs, in the Collection).  But I can't do something like the major work that
earn grant and prizes and gets burned onto CD and sold-- and not because I
haven't the skill but because the illness doesn't give me time.  I imagin
that is true for most cretive people with severe mental illness.  Episodes
erase creativity and it's very hard to retain anty interets in an onld
project.

I really AM crazy with manic depression and I don't like this kind of
research and statement.  I'm sure all the famous artists who were supposedly
manic depressive would have done more and better art had they not had the
illness.  I mean, right now I'm writing blind because my antipsychotics from
last night haven't worn off...not te ideal state in which to make a
painting!  People who are manic can produce, but more often they are stuck
in a horrible state of being apparently full of creative energy but unable
to focus on any one project for long enough to make progress.  And they lose
(at least I do) critical judgement-- when you;re manic, all your work looks
like a masterpiece, or if it doesn't, its very incompetence is showing
sommething special, like you imagine getting exhibited as "outsider art" or
"new American primitivism" (that is, if you can't draw).

So much for mania.  However many manic depressives, me included experience a
state akin to mania where you still have your marbles, called hypomania
(less than mania) and in that state it is possible to be very creative and
productive.  Usually though, it doesn't last long...you either crash down
through normalcy to depression (there is nothing to catch you at the middle
and make you stop there...(none of the mood stabilizing drugs really work
that way.  They prevent movememnt of mood altogeter and can prolong a bad
mood), so you either crash down or end up REALLY manic where you are no
longer creative but tortured by your mind and full of quests you must go on
that are really hard (and have bad consequences in the real world, like
walking on a bridge parapet stark naked).

If you resist, as I usually do, you can't do anything, it is as if
everything that regulates mood state is just gone so you start swinging from
high to low like a monkey swinging after a banana that's hanging on another
branch.  You start screaming, even foaming at the mouth. The world seems
increasingly unreal.You think you can go through the walls and wonder why
you don't fall through the floor since a house is but an insubstantial thing
anchored in a small sliver of time.  Yout travel in time until you are dead
and you feel being dead.  You do this even if you are alone.  It;s not a
scene you do for someone's benefit, it's the sound of the rending of the
universe to let you through.  Then, if you are smart you take smething (I
take risperdal, and antispsychotic when something like this happens, or
loxitane, another one) and in an hour or so reality returns,  You can't
believe you actually were that crazy.  Maybe you were making it up.  After
all everyone says you have a good imagination. But it's real-- not the time
travel of course, -- but the fact that you really FELT the universe break
open to allow yout o come through and observe from the outside.  People ask
you questions about the furture but you say "it's not like H.G. Wells, it's
hard to land and you never know where you are.  You don't see the whole
thing laid out in front of you...

I suppose one could write a poem about the above but other people have
plenty of experiences too and on average mentally ill folks haven't had the
experiences that are the fodder for most poetry (relationships, work, social
interactions) since we live an isolated and imporverished (culturally
anyway) life.  Many of us live on the street, for goodness sake!  There is a
very good art and pettry program at the day program at the agency which I
once worked for (whihch has a clientele that is 95% black with many homeless
and formerly homeless and very, very poor people), but she does her own
creaming, which isn't fair.  She intimidates all but the best artists and
writers out of her class and then encourages the remainder to no end.  They
put out and annual journal and have a reading which I went to.  It was
impressive given that these were former street people.  They wrote, on
average, like any other bunch of people taking a high powered poetry
workshop, ie quite a bit above the bla poem level.  The art is really hard
(it's another teacher).  They are forced to make it in total siilence and
then it get taped up to the door and the person who made it hads to explain
why they did it and what it means to tem.  They did one art show which
raised a ton of money for the agency snd they have the framed artwork all
over the  placee, plus there are posters from the art show.  I think that
was a little unfair to the artists.... if people wanted to buy their
paintings, they should have gotten the full proceeds with just a litlle
taken out for the class and materials, and they should have their own framed
artwork.  On the other hand, it certianly gets a lot of viewing because it's
on the way to the elevator.

My impression is that art (maybe unlike poetry) is a giod-given talent that
you don't just learn in a class.  I think the clients in poetry class
learned to write better poetry (She has secret methids and wouldn't let me
observe her class for "privacy" reasns even though the class members invited
me because I'd write poetry with clients when I had no work to do if there
was a client who was one of the poets areound.  But I know she did exercises
and had them read poems.  I have seen people who have never had a class
paint beautifully on the other hand, and if you ask how they learned,
they'll say things like "I just paint what is see" and "amyone can do this
if they try"  The guy whose self-portrait was their poster really did know
how to make an oil panting.  The sad part was that he did this
self-portrait, and then got deoressed and gained 200lbs and so his face
beca,e totally round and he looked completely different from the
self-portrait.  It must have made him feel bad to look at the poster ever
day...they had a copy of it in the day room of the residence he lives in, so
he could hardly avoid it, unless he wanted never to eat with people or go to
the kitchen or the patio or just hang out with other residents.  That's what
it's like to be mentally ill.

I feel the same way as he must when I look myself up on the web and find
math research papers that I coauthored or am thanked in.  I used to be
really good at math and got into Princeton.  But I went to an easy grad
school instead and flunked out anyway due to illness.  Then years later I
staarted an MFA in writing (which is impossible to flunk out at if you go,
but going was my biggest problem) but it was in Boston and I was commuting
from Providence and had 12 hour days with my work study and I couldn't do it
after the first semester and tried to kill myslef in the beginning of the
second.  Then I did the third semester, so I have completed a year with
mostly As (in all the workshops except for a short short story workshop
which taught me that I had no business ever trying to write fiction because
the sh*t I came out with was godawful, plus the class was hard, one story a
week and you had to give useful comments on all the others).  But then I
fled New England to go back and live with my father in NYC after my
boyfriend dumped me and my disability check was no longer enough to live on
in the style I was accustomed to.

I probably should have just gotten a smaller place in Providence (but I
loved my huge apartment with its hadwood floors and pantry and sunroom, etc,
and it was only $700 for five rooms) but I didn't have any more frineds
there.  Plus I got that counseling job last fall, only I lost it in December
because I was too depressed to get there every day, and I had thirteen
months of terrible depression (whilst seeing a very good doctor weekly,
which I could barely get out of bed to go do; I was mostly bedridden except
for whne I tried to kill myself again and landed it the loony bin which was
the most awful experience of my life although I had been i the hospital in
Providence and it was fine.  But  uit New York they treated me like I was a
criminal and wouldn't let me be voluntary and kept me for a whole three
weeks making me more and more depressed and telling me I wasn't depressed
and I ended up far worse than I was before I went.  Kudos to ICU at St.
Luke's though who were perfectly polite to me when I came to after they
saved me.  I don't understand why they bothered saving me though if they
were going to put me in their psych ward when they would make me want
desperately to die to escape the horrors of the place.  They liked tying
people to their beds by their hands and feet and leavig them there for 48
hours, screaming their heads off, which they let haoppen for a whle to scare
us all before injecting the victim with heavyy drugs.)

After the hospital, I went kind of nuts, seeing things and stuff caused by
one of my nine medications, so I spent a long time getting better from that.
And here I am, two years later, taking up projects I started two years ago
and coming up with ideas for the first time in years.  And I live in a
constant state of "controlled" hypomania, where i am high pretty much all
the time but take medicine when I feel myself getting TOO high.  A more
proudent (or less sympathetic to artistic pursuits) doctor would throw more
meds at me so I'd be totally bla-ed out, which is the general result of
tretament of manic depression.  So treated manic depressives tend to be LESS
creative than the average person, they are usually chemically suppressed so
much that they don't think at all.

Who publishes this book?  Where I get it?  I have no money today but will
have $50 tomorrow only it's supposed to last untikl my check comes through
which won't be until the second or the third.  I spent my last allowanc on a
bunch of Black Sparrow Press books that were on sale: Kelly  poems, Eshelman
poems, Tom Clark's Empire of Skin, and a short story Collection by Lucia
Berlin.  PPlus two books by Burroughs whom I've never read but feel I ought
to but I am a little put off by all the sex seeen from a male perspective,
and a book of C.K. Williams poems.  His poems are really prose essays to my
mind; I can just barely hear the prtry, but they speak to me anyway.  So
Iread.  Widely.  I didn't buy Language Poerty yeterday because there wasn't
any on sale at that shop.

I think you STILL haven't understood about Fakelangpoo but it seems hopeess
to repea the whole deal.  It is not a movement aginst poets like Silliman.
It asks, merely, how he does what he does: what deivices, vocabulary,
sebtence structure, line breaks, grammar, styleistic devices, logic, way of
combining unlike segments, etc. Siml;liman uses t make his poems "the real
thing," as you put it.  Surely you read his ppoems because of what';s in
them and not because he is Ron Silliman, well kknown Language Poet?  In that
case, the poems are fakelangpo, which refers to laguage poetry which is fun
to read, almost by definition, since you read it,  The site is a bit of a
joke, but I wanted to get poel talking about what makes something language
poetry and it has to some extent had that effect but unfortunately here and
not in my site yet much.  The poets whohave linked to my site are, ion all
but one case, serrious about their poetry in a straightforward way.  The
other person is serious but ius making a kind of poetic statement, a subtle
wone (go to the site and read  "3 Encounters"), not something as "puerile"
as "Poetry of genre X is bad."  I want to read the anthologgy you mention
and when i do I will post a book review of it in all seriousness on my site.
I intend there to be things worth reading that aren't jokes. It's mainly
just the word I used to descibe the genre which is a joke, because I was
making fun of the was some Language poets do not want to write readable
prpse becaise maybe then people will realize they have nothing to say (btw:
does Jorie Graham count as a Language Poet? her work strikes me as
pretentious bogosity, but I am afrain to think so because it is hard and
maybe I am just missing something.)

What's the name of the style of Thylias Moss's "Last Chance for the Tarzan
Holler"?  I don't think it's LP (it's not, I can affirm that).  The poems
are clearly about something.  But they are about something else too in each
poem and they have abstractions in a very modern way.  It's totally diferent
from her Small Congregations, in which the poms are straightforward
reollections of experiences growing up Black in the south plus some imagined
poems but in standard free verse...  There is something in these poems
(particularlt the first book I mentioned which is more layered and complex,
that yu don't get in Languag Poetry, that amost by definition can't tell
stories and make real political points.

Hey, why bother with the fake stuff when you can now read the real thing! A
new edition of -In The American Tree- edited by Ron Silliman is out from The
National Poetry Foundation. 607 pages, all new bio notes. So skip the
puerile imitations and sink your teeth into the challenging work that made
the experimental writing of the 70's and 80's the in thing to awkwardly
imitate in the not-that-new millenium. Nice editor photo on the back cover
too!

Being as open to reputational damage as the next guy, I took a look at the
Fakelangpo site. It's certainly energetic, and optimistic about all the
play space it has created. But there is curiously empty feeling as one goes
from frame to frame, looking for the positive content or even sustained
parody or critique. Undoubtedly, it will begin to fill up, but with what?

It reminded me of an effort by grad students at Berkeley in the early 90s
called MSRepresentations, a supposed parody of the journal,
Representations. They managed to get the typeface right, but the content
was basically ground-level anxieties about "theory" in general and showed
little actual reading of the New Historicism and its intellectual origins.
You can't parody effectively without reading.

I don't see much of a reading of "Language poetry," whatever that is, in
Millie Niss's site, and the recent debate was pretty scarce on examples as
well. If you go to that "what I see in L Poetry" forum, you will also see
few references to particular works--not much of an account of influence, or
of a rejection of one. What you get are: anxieties of authorship and
positionality.

Well, to be fair, there is another anxiety: a conceptual one. What are the
distinguishing features of a "language poem"; how will I know one when I
see one? That question could be approached by asking what it is one is
looking for when one identifies X, what is the conceptual framework for
categorizing. It could also be solved by reading examples. "What are the
distinguishing features of a New York School poem and how will I know one
when I see it" can be answered either by reflection on literary taxonomy,
or by reading New York School poems.

Nick is right: In the American Tree is newly available, in an upgraded
design and with vastly improved typesetting, to be looked at again. The
fact that Millie Niss was unaware of it does qualify the "authority," if
one wants to use that word, of the Fakelangpo site. But qualifications of
authority, of course, were the point all along, weren't they?

Barrett

And long live Fakelangpo! I hope it develops into a robust site that
everyone will want to refer to. I'm going to make it my homepage, in fact.
I've been looking for a substitute for CNN.news.

Hi Millie,

agree re the way depression is romanticised. Rather than pushing the
frontiers of creativity, when energy gets to a certain low one can hardly
push air in and out of one's lungs.

one small point

the url for your dancing rhino seems to be
www.sporkworld.org/epoetry/rhino.html

Though I recommend just going to www.sporkworld.org and clicking on epoetry.
My favourites are the dancing rhinoceri and the windchimes. Lovely stuff.

best

Hello Millie,
             I was moved by your story,
I too was diagnosed with manic depression,then bi-polar then Schizophrenia
and now It seems like a whole lot of crap. I don't even
have any of the symptoms of schizophrenia,and there is no
trace of it in any of the works I've produced (4 comedy books). All I get
now is limited creativity because of the medication (Risperidal)
I'm on. I'm starting to distrust these professionals, we're talking
about the mind here. My future and other people like me is in danger
because the doctors don't understand the nature of creativity.




                           regards Tony

Apologies for posting this.

I assumed that people might go back and look at earler exchanges in the
archives and also might like a link to some research.  I guess I should have
realized that people would have a tendency to personalize it and respond on
that basis.

I guess I should also have been aware of how volitile the subject still is
today and how outdated the attitudes are.

perhaps because some people would like to look to the future instead
of dwelling on the past.

christopher beach in 'poetic culture' states that the features that
l-p introduced in the 70s and eighties are now incorporated into the
writing of poetry by avant-garde and conventional poets alike. i
assume the paratactic devices and other style elements, as well as
the thematic exploration of theory and the writing of poetry
primarily for its readerly qualities rather than its sonic qualities,
are now tools we all carry in our poetry toolkit. so perhaps poetry
is looking for a new direction, new ways of saying what we have to
say. might i suggest and not meaning to be disrespectful, what you
may call 'real' langpo, is a bore because everything reads like
langpo these days.

can you recommend a good book of language poetry that has been
recently written  and published, and if so what advances has it made
to poetry that it's predecessors haven't made?

i encourage millie's effort, to understand the 'fake' we must have a
fair understanding of what the 'real' is also, otherwise the whole
thing is meaningless.

just a few thoughts

lawrence
you have identified the writer of poetry who doesn't read the works
of others and the poet who also reads, but what about the the poet
that listens to the work of others. much of my early knowledge of
other poet's work came at poetry soundings and open microphone
sessions in small coffee lounges, pubs and community halls. long
before i started reading poetry from books. what i notice is that as
i started attending more soundings in different communities, in
different cities, in different countries, the more i wanteed to learn
about poetry, which led me to reading books of past poets. i also
noticed there was always a percentage of the audience who were not
readers of poetry books but who received their words by listening and
who wrote (mostly confessional) poetry. the problem was that if these
people only attended one sounding regularly, they would have a
limited knowledge base. their cultural experience of poetry is indeed
different from the people on a list like this, but still a valid one,
not a 'waste of space' as Martin Stannard, and you, might suggest. as
you say it is a community activitiy and there are different types of
community.

secondly lets identify another category of poetry player. the reader.
are there any people who just read poetry these days?
in australia all major publishers have stopped publishing new single
author poetry collections, this is left to the 'small presses',
because the market is not big enough to break even without government
subsidy.
the u of california press news recently confirms similar decisions in the usa.


are the only readers of poetry today writers who are also readers,
and critics and theorists? has poetry become an academic exercise?
is the activity of poetry a writerly activity rather than a readerly activity?

i personally enjoy all aspects, writing, reading, listening,
composing for this medium(the web), talking about poetry on lists
like this, teaching it to students, performing it at my local arts
collective once a month, performing at conferences, which i'm sure
you do too, and i wouldn't like to identify one aspect as being more
imnportant than any other.

regards

Good show Aaron but sorry, I don't want to belong to any school of
poetry that would accept me as a member.

Those are my principles. If you don't like them I have others

Subject:      Learning curves
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I'd like to compare two "learning curves" in the last day's discussions:
the first in relation to the fakelangpo site, and the second re the moving
account of the experience of manic depression. Obviously I hadn't read the
second thread when I entered into the first.

Re the first: the complaint I am raising has to do with the leveling
generality of response. The word "langpo" itself may central to this
effect. It has become a variable whose value tends to the null set in a
dysfunctional equation; i.e., plug in the same value, get the same result.
The atrophy of responses may be what is wanted in order to clear the ground
for further work; this would account for the paucity of specific readings,
perhaps. But in the literary series, it is not possible to "exit" a
sequence so easily. The Language School, in fact, has a great deal to say
about "clearing the ground" for further work. I'd go further and suggest
that there were three "moments" of such ground clearing in American poetry
over the last hundred years, and each took place after a war. There's
something outside the literary series, then, that intersects with new
possibility. What does the reductiveness of "langpo" have to do with
"exterior" logics of clearing the ground? It seems to be completely
"internal" to the series, and thus by definition cannot get outside, to a
"clearing." This is another way of saying that "langpo" is a redundant
placeholder; as a response, it's the null set. It refers to nothing except
the guilt toward precedence that holds it in place. It's a "symptom."

This is a kind of "negative learning curve," where we unlearn specificity
and all results tend to the same result. It can be reassuring in some
senses--what was the fuss about all along? I am going to suggest, on the
contrary, that the only way out is through, so that if a problem presents
itself to you in your development, it is necessary to go through the
problem entirely. This means learning everything about it, unfortunately
for you, rather than reducing it to a symptom-word. (Something like that is
what I've been trying to do in writing on the New Americans.)

On the other hand, Millie Niss's narrative of her experience does result in
learning. This is, as always, a very welcome communication.

Why are the two learning curves so completely opposed, as dynamics? One
toward the null set, the other toward a fullness of human understanding? Is
this a tendency of the second toward the first due to the property of the
literary work, which seems to prescript and mediate? In what sense is the
second learning curve being misunderstood in the drive toward the first?

We may recall the great opening of Breton's First Manifesto: "So strong is
the belief in life, in what is most fragile in life--real life, I
mean--that in the end this belief is lost."

Take your point Komninos, about listeners

The Stannard, which I endorsed by quoting as I did, comes in a volume on
poetry readings,so he spoke in a specific context ... and I had just been
disagreeing with someone that a *good way rather than a desperate way of
getting people to go to gigs is to include open mike;  and I was still
grumpy

I haven't come upon many of the kind of people you speak of, but perhaps
that's my narrowness

| are there any people who just read poetry these days?

I know some - if you mean people who read it but dont write it (and not
people who read nothing but poetry) - I know quite a few actually

| has poetry become an academic exercise?

No! Wasn't it St Paul who said To the academic all things are academic

Thanks for looking at my site.  You're quite right, it is rather ampty.  I
had hoped I could engage people in producing the kind of content I had in
mind.  Perhaps I made a mistake with the "Fake" nomenclature, since that was
more of a passing joke.

I tried myself to define what I saw as external qualitioes of LP once here--
didn'generate much argumanet although it was highly incpmplete.  For me as a
reader the strangest thing about encountering Language poetry was that it
was made up of chunks which apparently didn't have anything to do with each
other (although they might come in groups of related thematic or stylistic
material scattered throughout the poem, and thus acquitre "meaning" if one
read the whole poem.  But one first reading one is apt to be frustrated
because there is nothing to grab onto..poetry goes by, and whne you have it
in mind, the next thig you read is something entire;y different.

What the chunks are depends on the popem and author: In Silliman's N/O (and
the other letters but I'm not as familiar with them) you get chiunks which
could be pieces of contemporary free verse poems. In a book like Coolidge's
Alien Tatters, there are sentencess arranged visibly in chunks, but in some
sense the sentenses are trhe chnks since they are the smallest coherent
unit, and they themselves are surreal, but grammatical.  The chunks of
sentences realte to each other grammatically (anaphors are uses within
chunks but not between them) and thematically, but they make the the thing
make even less sense.  Curiously, the poem (the long one at the beginninng
of the book; there are a few shorter works at the end) as a whole is
relatively coherent: one could say what it is "about (alien
sightings/kidnappings, or people who believe they have been kidnapped by
aliens).  This adds to readablibility but does not seem altogether necessary
unless it is ncessary in order to keep peope reading a poem of a few hundred
pages.

A ppoet such as Rod Smith writes with various-sized chunks (always set apart
by white space; you can almost tell  a language poem just by looking for all
the dense text surrounded by whitespace) but many chunks are individual
words or phrases, and the poems as a whole evoke an era or a an event
sometimes, but they aren't traditionally lyrical and they certainly don't
narrate anything (even in the sense the Alien Tatters can be said to ba a
narrative poem).  IO only have one book of his to go on, In Memory of my
Theories, but have read some of the other poems and they use similar
techniques.  It was a poem of Smiths that prompted me to make that tutorial
about transforming a poem into LP by chnaging the line break so the words no
longer make sense and sound profound.  For he has a poem that goes in part:

        Are not our feelins, as it were inscibed,
        on things around us. sandwichman, promoter, publicist
        wellspring, coxswain

        last weather
        and well her rendering

        of that which is distant: ...


which of sourse sounds worse but makes a lot more sense as

        Are not our feelings,
        As it were, inscribed
        On things around us:
        Sandwichman, promoter, publicist?

        Wellspring, coxswain,
        Last weather,
        And well her rendering
        of that which is distant:

I'm obviously noit saying the second way is better; it's not.  But it is
"the poem under the poem" her wrote, in the sense that if he were thinking
in prose sentences in his head (which I doubt poets do, but that's another
discussion), he would have thought of the same sentence in both cases, and
the "obvious" rendering is the second one.  I actually really like the first
(although these lines do little for me, they seem sort of prosy because I
_read_ the way I re-wrote them trying to make sense and I wrote a poem
called "The Sandwichman" so that distracted me.

I don't know how the poems of Susan Howe fit into the chunk theiry though--
they seeem different in many respects from other Language poetry: the words
are strangely chosen so in some sense she has word-sixed chunks put into
sentences or lines which aren't grammatical and don't make sense, but he
works often have a lot of literary or social history beghind them, as if
they were researched essays.  You actually learn cold hard facts from a
Susan Howe poem, though that isn't why you read one.  When she writes of
Tristan and Islde,say, or of Arthururian tales, you feel she is _continuing_
the tradition of retelling these stories, in a modern idiom that we find
palatable, just as the stories were originallly passed from language group
to language group and ultimately to frnch and English and then from say,
Malory's English, to Tennyson's, (not to mwntion Spenser's, Swinburnes, etc.
etc. in between), and then, as if in a straight line, to Susan Howe.

But anyway, I see composistion in chunks as the major (macro, l;arge scale &
obvious feature of most language poetry, as well as "not making sense" inan
obvious denotional way, but of course many modernist and postmodern schools
have played weith the extent to which poetry must make sense.  I find the
Modeernists (Pound  more than Eliot) verry good at not making sense, but
you'd never take the cantos for a language poem-- it is too overcompposed,
linked within itself, and lets in too little air.  Language poems tand to be
airy (not an insulkt); their whitespace leaves room for interpretation
That's why it is somewhat heretical to speak of Pound not making sense,; the
correct thing to say is that one hasn't penetrated Pound's meaning in Canto
whatever, which assumes he was very specififc in havig a meaning, which he
may well have been.  I am just not sure it is to be found in te poem itsef;
maybe it was just in Pound's mind but did not readch the poem or maybe the
meaning was dissipated throughout the whole modernist opus and that if one
read every texrt of the period (including non literary ones such as the
daily papers) one would say, "ah!" and undertstand.

Such hidden meanings did not disapppear with rthe moderninsts. There are
poems of Robert Lowell's (the ones which aren't taught) in, say, the
Dolphion, Notebook (especsciallty) and "History" which are absolutely
inscrutable if you don't know the details of Lowells marriages, children,
and divorces, and yet they arfe written with universal pronouns so it is not
immediastely evident, say, that he is writing to his daughter Harriet.  And
Lowell is not a particularly "difficult" poet, but he was a poet in
eveything and so wrote poems in responses to his life's events and didn't
see why he should have to explain who everybody was because he knew
perfectly well and they were poems for him (well I think this is tryue of
Notebook.  The Dolphin wreally was written for publication, but it's the
only one of these books that does say who a poem is for and what's going on
in his lidf ewhen he writes it; I think History was written as a sequel to
Notebook, and I think he meant to publish both but maybe didn't care wheter
the reader could understand. Plu his affirs etc. were notorious and people
would have understood.)

I don't get the impression that Language poems are working with hiudden
meanings though--- I think they are an atempt at no meaning, or at a meaning
which distills out of nothingness, based on the words of the poem.  I'm on
shaky, shaky ground here though, because I'm responding to Laguage poet who
obviously knows betterr than I do why.  I was tryiing to say in this email
WHAT I saw in LP as a naive reader; why is a question only the poets can
answer!


Millie

P.S.  Will post this on Fakelangpo, hopefully to get a serious discussion
going!

from frame to frame, looking for the positive content or even sustained
parody or critique. Undoubtedly, it will begin to fill up, but with what?

It reminded me of an effort by grad students at Berkeley in the early 90s
called MSRepresentations, a supposed parody of the journal,
Representations. They managed to get the typeface right, but the content
was basically ground-level anxieties about "theory" in general and showed
little actual reading of the New Historicism and its intellectual origins.
You can't parody effectively without reading.

I don't see much of a reading of "Language poetry," whatever that is, in
Millie Niss's site, and the recent debate was pretty scarce on examples as
well. If you go to that "what I see in L Poetry" forum, you will also see
few references to particular works--not much of an account of influence, or
of a rejection of one. What you get are: anxieties of authorship and
positionality.

Well, to be fair, there is another anxiety: a conceptual one. What are the
distinguishing features of a "language poem"; how will I know one when I
see one? That question could be approached by asking what it is one is
looking for when one identifies X, what is the conceptual framework for
categorizing. It could also be solved by reading examples. "What are the
distinguishing features of a New York School poem and how will I know one
when I see it" can be answered either by reflection on literary taxonomy,
or by reading New York School poems.

Nick is right: In the American Tree is newly available, in an upgraded
design and with vastly improved typesetting, to be looked at again. The
fact that Millie Niss was unaware of it does qualify the "authority," if
one wants to use that word, of the Fakelangpo site. But qualifications of
authority, of course, were the point all along, weren't they?

And long live Fakelangpo! I hope it develops into a robust site that
everyone will want to refer to. I'm going to make it my homepage, in fact.
I've been looking for a substitute for CNN.news.

(hope this isn't out-of-date when it finally gets posted. (make me happy,
tim.))

I haven't spent much more than a few seconds on the fakelangpo site, except
to make that duck explode (again and again!). You gotta wonder what it is
about it that's getting under the real language poets' skin, since as Barrett
pointed out, it doesn't pose that much of a threat (i.e. intellectual or
institutional rival to the current avant-garde), and, as Nick stated, it's
actually kind of boring and maybe not that fun at all. But this question of
fun will not go back into the genie bottle. It's Millie's insistence that
fakelangpo is the kind of linguistically experimental work that is funner
than the original langpo that has to be annoying as hell. It harkens back to
Steve Evans' essay on Rebecca Wolff's Fence Manifesto ('97) and her apparent
reduction of all poetical values into one word: fun. The kids, it seems, want
to have fun, and the adults, it seems, want to have.... reputations maybe?
intellectual companionship? a page in literary history with their name on it?
ideology critique? job security? the high road of art? respect?

It can't help but be annoying because some language poetry actually was fun.
Stephen Rodefer's _Four Lectures_ is very fun, edgy, smart, funny and nasty,
too. Bob Perelman's work is kind of fun if not funny. Some Alan Davies is fun
as I recall. Some will say Charles Bernstein's work is fun, entertaining. And
everyone loves Ron Silliman's puns. Barrett's work, however, is not fun at
all. And if it were fun or tried to be so, it would ruin it (see CNN joke at
bottom of "fake response" post). In fact, it's not even not fun. It's not
anti-fun or against fun. It's a-fun, which is a higher form of fun if you
think about it.

What's my point? My point is that what a lot of language poetry, the kind
Millie is probably reacting to (in addition to its tedious pedagogy, mostly
likely that, yes), lacks as well as fakelangpo (or any poetry based on fun as
sole goal, except for FLARF!, which is in a class of its own) is DEEP FUN.
Something more fun than fun. The total package.

For instance, if Millie and I were to have sex, as she said she wanted to, we
could go out and have fun. Ride a rollercoaster, eat ice cream, roll over
dumpters. We could tease and joke, like they do on that stupid MTV
'Dismissed' show, engage in flirtatious banter ("I''m so hungry, I could eat
you," etc). I could drop an ice cube down her blouse (surprises are always a
turn-on) and she could make me an Easter basket with an Easter egg that had
the words 'Big Ben' painted on it (for no reason). This would all be fun
foreplay but it's nothing compared to the deep fun to come. The deep fun I
can't speak of here because I don't want to ruin it for you, Millie.

Or anyone else who wants to join us.

That's right. You can't stop lightning from striking.

Let's see, I got two old poems, "Are We There Yet?" and "In Jail with the
Moon," at the secret preview issue of Shampoo. Thanks Del Ray.
www.shampoopoetry.com/ShampooTwelve/hess.html

I got a mostly positive review in Jacket 18 of Noelle Kocot's first
full-length collection, _4_. This is definitely a poet (especially younger
poets) should read and get to know. Thanks John.
www.jacketmagazine.com/18/hess-r-kocot.html

I got another mostly positive review of flarfmeister Gary Sullivan's _How to
Proceed in the Arts_ in the latest Possum Pouch. Has anyone reviewed _Swoon_
yet? As a poet-friend recently asked, why isn't that book selling out? Thanks
Dale, Hoa and Jerrold.
www.skankypossum.com/pouch.htm

I got an interview (about Yasusada, what else) with Kent Johnson in the
latest Exquisite Corpse. Kent and I had a flame-war on the Poetryetc listserv
last spring after he invited me onto it by saying he wanted to "kick my
petit-bourgeois ass." The love then went backchannel. Kent saved the emails,
took out my jokes and managed to make the mess look like a conversation. I
was notified of its existence a few weeks ago. Thanks Kent.
www.corpse.org/issue_11/manifestos/hess_johnson.html

(note: if it still says in the intro to the 'Yasusada Dialogues' that I
published something in the Poetry Project Newsletter, please ignore. After a
meltdown occured between me and one of the editors, my chances of having
something in that magazine were about as good as Millie Niss posting a
message without a typo. Also, _The Diaries of Nat Turner_ should be _The
Confessions of Nat Turner_ as the Scot Robin Hamilton pointed out. Those
interested in a debate on the pressing issues of heteronymity and authorship
should write Kent. Talking about that stuff now feels like trying to drink
straight lemon juice.)

Is the atrophy of response what is wanted, to clear ground or otherwise?

The idea that work is done to "clear the ground" for anything  seems
an old model of producing change in literary formations -- one which
I happen to subscribe to -- but it  important to remember that in
this ground-clearing certain work needs to be done -- and that many
of the people who are encountered on the streets of this new vertical
public sphere are not going to be interested in the same things, one
of which is the work involved. What would such work consist of? What
would one need to know, what problems or issues would need to be
"worked through"?  Are they simply formal questions of practice?
Because yes, most of the formal techniques used didn't originate
recently. Was their deployment situational, motivated by practical
concerns or issues of praxis? ... Well? What do I need to know now?

The "list itself" presents a number of structural difficulties in
terms of fostering the kind of environment where such work would get
done, or where the thinking about it might be represented. The
atrophy of response is often, I think, a response to this structure
of response as it presents itself in a general and generalizing
medium as the poetics listserv channel.

Some observations:

1. The constituencies represented by the list are too broad. Like
many academic conferences, it's too diffuse for there to be a
productive developmental discussion surrounding key issues. While
this isn't a problem, per se, you get what you pay for. In such a
generalized community, difference is boiled in with the broth, and no
one is willing to step forward.

2. One example of this is the endless "academic" bashing on the list.
The unspecific nature of the accusations about university culture
demonstrate many a sad point: a) that compulsory education should
probably be extended into the 22nd grade, at a minimum, and that
continuing education programs continue forever. b) it isn't the ideas
of the academy that bother these people, it's the idea of it. But
because there is no systematic or articulated grounds for attacking
the "idea of it", the response whithers only to be repeated by
another, solo flight.

3. One need for the "re-education" of "human capital" (jingoistic
terms courtesy of the World Bank, another promoter of
anti-intellectual, anti-academic culture) is demonstrated by the
incredibly spotty institutional memory of the culture of the poetics
list. Every few moons or so, there is a need to replay the same old
concerns: hang-wringing over language poetry: what was it (or what is
it), who has more power (theoretically informed but marginal language
poets or the sincere but bathy mainstream poets), blah blah blah. It
would almost be fun to make a list of endlessly repeated topics.

4. This failure to develop our collective memory is "symptomatic" of
larger cultural forces - the multiple, discontinuous vectors of
influence and audience, place, technology - all contribute to a
layered sense of the present. It's not an academic issue, or at least
it need not be limited to the university culture. We might instead
reflect on what's left of the "public intellectual" in contemporary
culture. Who are our public intellectuals? We might talk about why
there aren't MORE intellectuals in public life (i.e. outside of the
university). And what is meant by "public life" -- a life of letters
to the editor? or...what? Why is it, after years of study, do so many
students and scholars reach similar conclusions about particular
social and economic issues? Why have so many of our public
intellectuals become so profoundly anti-intellectual?

5. An interesting poet in a "group" to talk about with respect to
these issues, and how they have to do with "poetry" -- for those of
you who need references to actual poems -- would be a discussion of
the poet Robert Lowell, who Millie mentions rather usefully as a poet
worthy of discussion in the context of langpo. I think that many of
Lowell's poems could be brought into such a discussion on two
grounds, one formal and the other social. As an "intellectual" and a
"pacifist" and as a "rich kid" who led a "bohemian" life of
"privledge" while doing "cultural labor" of writing "poetry" in a
community of writers many of whom have continuing influence and
others of whom seem to have disappeared from memory. Millie's point
about the poems is a good place too look closely. Anyone know about
Lowell? His life or his madness? I'd be curious to know if anyone has
a reference to the Look Magazine photo shoot of the early sixties, a
copy of which I'd like to find for personal reasons (my father was
the photographer). Lowell's NOTEBOOKS and their subsequent revision
is a study in the medicalization of poetry by the dominating forces
of decorum and generalization. Worthy of study by any one wishing to
understand language poetry.

I agree with Tom Orange that Eileen Myles definitely energized the gathering
(she certainly did so for me) but what was energizing about her presentation
was not only that she is a terrific "extemporaneous" speaker- the strength
of Eileen's point actually had to do with a thread in the panel discussion
concerning what is left of the concept of the avant-garde and what this
concept might still have of practical value for contemporary experimental
poets. This had to do, in Eileen Myles' opinion, with what she called the
"amicability" of the (1990's) avant-garde. To my surprise, my acquaintance
Tom Orange, whose own work has on occasion given my personal avant-garde
poetics chops quite a hefty boost, was apparently bored by EM's feminist
version of an avant-garde that is not afraid to be mutually supportive,
gentle, amicable even to the point of relating to other poets in an open and
mutually supportive way  about feelings such as those of loss (mentioned by
more than one person on the panel.) If the truth be known, I've  never been
the type to turn away aghast at an exciting bit of literary gossip or
debate. But this crowd was definitely not in the mood to rise to Douglas
Rothschild's inflammatory prodding's nor to those concerning The Death Of
The Avant-Garde  of another attendee, who also happened to be an
acquaintance of mine. I guess I was one of the audience members most guilty
of expressing certain pacifist leanings towards certain apparently quite
boring urges to discuss things in a gentle, perhaps even quietly rational
and mutually supportive manner. Do poets have to be constantly feisty or
insulting and sarcastic towards one another to be considered brilliant,
witty and amusing?

Let's face it-  men- and women-all too often resort to shooting things,
points and people down to in order to deal with feelings of any kind- loss
or whatever-or just to get lots of attention. Then off to the gym or the
poetry wars committee meeting.

This brings me to a related old gripe that I might as well mention, since
I'm on the topic of the poetics of aggression. I once asked Rochelle Ratner
why she supported the publishing of some vicious attacks put forth by
Richard Kostelanetz in the American Book Review (not to be confused with the
American Poetry Review) including calling Charles Bernstein a fascist and
that his book -My Way- should be compared to Hitler's -Mein Kampf-. By a
strange coincidence I had warned Charles years before of the possibility
that some weird literary character might insult him by twisting this title.
When I asked Rochelle Ratner why the ABR persisted in publishing
Kostelanetz' ravings and further responses to them in the letters section,
she said  -we need controversy to bring interest to the magazine-. Clearly
the poetics of aggression won out over the poetics of amicability at the ABR
on this occasion.

I don't think it's the case that readers have failed Language writing by
not going far enough into the subject.

We have had something like 15 years to separate the wheat from the chaff.
That's a lot of winnowing.  What is there to show for it?  Undoubtedly
dissertations are now being written on individual Language writers, but, as
I see it, the younger poets have already moved on.

Readers have not overlooked individual differences within the school.
Language writing has had a much more generous reception, in fact, than it
has afforded poets outside the school.  But all this attention seems not to
have identified significant works.

(I leave aside Susan Howe, who is a genuinely exciting poet.  And,
actually, if Language writing made her career easier than it would have
been then that is something good.)

My sense as a former editor is that Language writing influences poetic
practice as a mannerism.  You don't have to read very much to see how the
game is played.  There's the mode of tedious cleverness and word play, the
mode of the jackanapes, the mode of the Wittgenstein fetishist, the dreamy
soft-focus feminine mode, the satirist-of-consumerism mode, the
documentarian mode, etc.  Other editors will know what I'm talking about.

Let's shift our attention to the generation now coming to maturity.  That
is where the interest lies, I think.

One of the most difficult things about being a poet has to do with the issue
of legitimizing one's work. In almost every case, as poets become more
experienced they learn to make some efforts to earn and/or acquire some form
of literary response or acknowledgement. Since L-A poetry has earned a
degree of "name" of not "face" recognition (there are over 750 references to
it on the Google search engine) it is no surprise that currently all kinds
of opportunities are available to find ways to exploit this to get
attention. Every since L-A poetry obtained some recognition there have many
people anxious to get attention for themselves by what came to be called
L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E bashing. But possibly the secret of the success of L-A
poetry was that the activities of these poets had more to do with creating a
space for making various kinds of experimental, or otherwise unconventional,
poetry available rather than legitimizing this or that specific poetry or
style of writing. In this sense, the fake langpo website is an
understandable outgrowth of the efforts of L-A poets to create more space
for experimental poetry. My difficulty had to do with the phrase "fake" but
what the hell. I never liked the phrase "language poetry" much either. I
think most serious poets have had the experience of being confronted by
others, frequently relatives or close friends, who imply they are wasting
their time, and that in some sense what they are doing is -fake-. This is
because only famous poets, and usually only famous poets who have been dead
a long time, can be considered -real- poets. So, in some sense, to most
people all poets except for these very few poets who have been legitimized
or, as they say, canonized, have some aura of being fake. Most of the poets
I know who have been focused on poetry every day of their lives from 20 to
50 years appear to be quite sensitive, painfully sensitive, to this issue of
the legitimization of their activities (to be somewhat distinguished from
getting credit for the quality of their poetic activities). The L-A poets I
think were most successful in creating an atmosphere of legitimizing the
activity of writing unconventional poetry. You would have to be over 50 to
remember how conservative the poetic establishment was before the activities
of L-A poetry somewhat changed the atmosphere. The pressure to write
conventional poetry in order to get published was very powerful prior to the
70's, particularly in the U.S. Try to imagine that in the 60's the poetry of
Robert Creeley, for example, still appeared unconventiona indeed to many,
and served as a beacon in that regard for my own early efforts. It can be
very difficult to spend a good deal of your life on something that large
numbers of people feel is a meaningless waste of time. This isn't to say
that there are not large numbers of people who feel poetry is important.
There are. But of course, there are few who feel that the career of poet
makes any sense at all. Once, one of my relatives said to me, when he
couldn't find my telephone number and had to check information- you can't
even get your phone number published-. To this day, a good deal of what I
experience about the public response to poetry discourages me from wanting
to continue the practice of writing poetry at all. Of late I have not felt
that way at all about this list, although there have been times that I have.
I don't want to do anything to discourage the expansion of possibilities for
experimental and unconventional poetry, or any poetry for that matter. So,
fake langpo people, from my point of view, go on and fake it all you like.
Just keep writing it and getting it out there.

Millie---

just to respond to this one point---



(always set apart
by white space; you can almost tell  a language poem just by looking for all
the dense text surrounded by whitespace)

this is a not true; though some language poets (and others,
who say are involved with Iowa or Brown, etc.)
who've appropriated this device (not that the l.ps invented it either)
would have one believe it....

there are many "maximalists" (as a shorthand word) among them---
for an interesting relatively early discussion of this white space issue
as a debate WITHIN (or between) the language poets
see Rae Armantrout's POETIC SILENCE and the after talk discussion
in Writing/Talks edited Perelman (1985)....
when i teach L.P I like to to use this text....

Hi All,

I'm going to be in Los Angeles (Marina del Rey actually) June 14 -
23.  If anybody knows of anything interesting going on during that
time, please backchannel me.

Thanks.

        Thanks for your comments on my site.  It was fun to make, but one never
knows if others will like it (especially since I didn't include anything
interactive like a guestbook...I think I barely even have my email address
publicized throughout the site...a mistake.  I wanted to make a personal
site that looked like a repository of works (I have seen good sites of this
sort) with its own title etc., rather than a "Millie's Home Page:  Welcome
to my site, I'd looooove to get email from U!" kind of thing -- but the
result is that I get no comments from viewers unless they go out of their
way to comment, as you did, or else when I put up a new work and publicize
it.

        I've always wanted to do a chapbook (or book) called "Public
Transportation" using all my subway poems and the few bus poems I have. It
might open with "13 ways of Looking at a Subway," then go on to "Dear Mr.
Fieldmanager" or "Excuse for a Delay Between Stations," maybe with one of
the more abstract, Languagier ones in between, like "Public Transportation"
and end with "Shooting: A Subway Story."  I think I have more public
transport poems than these as well.  I loked at Wild Honey Press's web page,
but it seemed like all the writers were quite famous, which is a little
off-putting...can you recommend a press that does quality chapbooks (not a
vanity press) that might consider my work?  I am regrettably barely
published at all in poetry (I have a few journalism credits and some
mathematics etc.)

        The only two poems I got published were both in the same place, the Poetry
Page of "The Buffalo News" (which isn't too bad considering the number of
Buffalo poets, but I wish it were more than tewo poems published  and also
two different places; oddly enough though, "The Buffalo News" actually
_pays_ for poetry.)  I guess I'm seeking advice on how to break in, but I
know the answer is submit sumbit sumbit.  I haven't submitted anything for a
year (and I have written) so it would seem to be my own fault.  And it's not
even that I particularly mind getting rejection slips, it's more that I'm
disorganized and can't keep track of what I've submitted where if I actually
submit everything I have that is ready for submission.  I'm sure if I
submitted fifty poems to as many journals, I'd get something in somewhere
(are there fifty journals one would want one's poems in?

        There are maybe more like thirty, but one can sumbit more tan one poem to
each one...)  The other tack is to submit to really bad journals.  Maybe
this is what one has to do to get started-=- perhaps you can advise. But I
really don't want my poems in a journal called "The Beginner Poet" which
says right in it that it's for beginnning level [eg bad] poems.  I'd submit
to small local journals but they, aside from the fact that they are nearly
impossible to find anywhere, tend to put out one or two issues ofnd then
die, or else they become important and hard to get into (I'm in NYC, where a
local journal could have a local area in the millions).

        I'd be happy to know what jounals if any people recommend that are less
competetive that the really good ones, but aren't full of really bad poetry
with an editor who loves bad poetry...  [here I am, using "bad" as a
critical term again; bad is not an acceptable word in criticism -- though
it's less offensive than "good" -- but everyone I think will understand what
I mean if a say "a small journal which publishes really bad poetry that the
editor actually thinks is good"]

        Anyway, this is basically a letter from a young versifier (don't know if I
am actually a poet-- claiming that one is is quite pretentious unless one
has published widely and/or earns one's living through teaching poetry...)

        ...actually I probably could do the latter; I teach poetry for free for a
nonprofit which never pays for anything useful and apparently spends a large
budget on raising more moeny because there is no evidence of any moeny being
spent on programs, services offered, personnel who offer the services,
persons to whom the services are offered, or anything else useful.  Even my
father who was on the Board and my best frined who is now on the Board have
no idea how the money is spent...  But actually, I am just BORROWING their
space (they wouldn't even lend us their mailing list to advertise our
workshops) to teach poetry because they were against the program we
proposed.

        I wonder what they thought of a bunch of funny looking obviously crazy
people sitting around the conference room table taking turns reading from
Homer last week [Fagels translation, the only fun one! although Fitgerald is
OK.  Lattimore may be accurate, but I would have totally lost my audience]
I imagine they were a bit surprised...we are supposed to be idiots.  I only
wish they'd heard the discussion after wards or read the in class writing
people did, whihc was impressive. We were reading aloud with the door open
as the staff left so everyone must have heard us!

Millie

P.S.  Being one myself, it seems to me I have the right to say that these
crazy people were funny looking and obviously crazy.

I've but gathered a few hate flowers by the wayside where Nick has fronted
the frayings of Oberleutnant K. , to whom I would like to point out that in
1980, in Berkeley, 3 poetry books were printed, My Poetry, y Life and My
Pleasures, but met with no charges of fascism whatsoever. The first thing I,
being of historical mind, thought of Charles' new title was Sinatra's hit,
given CB's tedency to flirt with pop,and then next I recalled the books by
myself, Lyn Hejinian and Laura Chester. What I thought of those titles at
the time was that each represented an attempt to rise ab'se the 'me'ness of
the decade by questioning the refeential range of 'me' and 'my'---'My'
poetry was about poetry I felt a family feeling for; not imply my own. What
a monster,  I now think, CB has become in the mind of RK, for his vision
(RK's) to have manifested. How out of touch he mus be, I think, to miss the
far more obvious referents in CB's title. It's not as though CB had called
his book 'My Offensive' or 'My Struggle' or 'My Final Solution'.
           C harles Bernstein first and foremost is a fine poet and has
earned the right to be read by an audience that has had the opportunity to
learn him, i.e., to allow the most likely reference-nets to bw checked
first.  Of course, we have many of us taught, and been confronted by the odd
student who could cipher regicidal longings from Wordsworth's "Nuns fret
not." But, however reluctantly (for novelty we do love) we have had to
relinquish our paranoid fantasies (with their uncomofortable revelations
that ist is ourselves who crave to say 'Heil Bernstein,' or "Heil Asbery' or
"Heil Kostelanetz.'
                                 Viele Danke, Hr. Bromige.

Joel: 1. Lerning curves as in curve balls? You seem to be throwing a few.
Here's one: conflating doubts about the university as a home for poetry
with anti-intellectualism is more than a little insulting. Surely you know
better. Probably most of the poets you read were only tangentially
connected to universities--think nof Pound, Williams, the Objectivists,
Olson, Duncan, Spicer, O'Hara, Ginsberg. Many of these were also doing
theory way beyond anything found in American academia at the time (altho
I'll admit a preference for the theory inherent in their ways of
working).  When a trough was opened for poets to feed at of course they
bellied up--it's nice having a source of income and maybe a little
respectability. The problem is what gets traded, and what gets lost to the
culture of poetry in general.

I write as a New Yorker who still hasn't recovered from the shock of
learning how little dialogue there is in the hinterlands. In New York, as
in all cosmopolitan cities, university affiliations are almost beside the
point--the pool of intellect and talent, and the variety of educations, not
all of them academic, that the pool brings to the discussion is enormously
wide. And its members positively shout for attention. There's a kind of
generosity in this. One wonders about other places, where the only
intellectual activity is within universities that might as well be Martian
colonies and almost no one goes in or out.

Here in San Diego there's a poetry series in an out-of-the-way university
with a serious parking problem and expensive parking fees. Without a car
one simply can't get there, except for a shuttle bus that runs from only
one point in the city, which, unless one has a great deal of time, also
takes a car to get to. Oh, and the reading is during most people's working
hours. There would seem to be a message in this.

In Paris the Ecole des Hautes Etudes at the Sorbonne sponsors open, free
public lectures by the greats of the academy. Anyone who chooses can hear
the latest research or thinking of specialists who don't talk down to their
amateur listeners.  Why should they? Half the cafes in town are informal
debating societies.

What all of this means is that the society is enriched, but so is the
university. The plethora of informal settings where passionate amateurs
gather makes for a cross-fertilization that's often missing on campus,
where people can pass years with only the most limited intellectual contact
from workers in other fields.

2. The reason there's such poor institutional memory on lists is their
nature as lists.  Memberships change. So what may be a tired and
oft-visited topic for you may be for many their first encounter with it in
this venue. Maybe you'd like to require a full reading of the archive,
followed by a test, before membership is granted.

Of course, it's possible that the discussions recur because members feel as
if their ideas have simply been dismissed. because not fullty formulated.
Discussion can be a venue for formulating ideas. That, of course, requires
that the thoughts of others be treated with respect.

G8 security cleared to use lethal force: Protesters warned
Mark Reid, National Post (Friday, May 24, 2002)
http://www.canada.com/search/site/story.asp?id=3D42B4751B-650D-4B30-9631-B7F=

CALGARY -- Canadian soldiers have the green light to use ''lethal force'' to
protect world leaders at the G8 Summit, a top-level military commander said.

''We are very serious ... we have lethal weapons and we will use force if we
think there is a serious threat,'' Brigadier-General Ivan Fenton told the
Calgary Herald yesterday.

Brig-Gen. Fenton also warned that protesters and ''limelight seekers'' who
intend to test the summit security in Kananaskis will be risking their=
 lives.

Brig-Gen. Fenton said terrorists could very easily use the ''peaceful''
protesters as a cover to slip into Kananaskis.

''We're not interested in protesters except that protesters complicate our
job,'' Brig-Gen. Fenton said. ''They can ... distract us and the police from
the person who is camouflaged, carrying a weapon and moving at night.''

Given that threat, Brig-Gen. Fenton said he's very concerned his soldiers
might mistake a protester for a terrorist if there's a confrontation in the
darkened, forested environment of Kananaskis.

''We're really worried about the blurring of what's coming toward us,''
Brig-Gen. Fenton said. ''There is a risk, and it's a very big concern.''

The G8 Summit, a meeting of the seven major industrialized democracies and
Russia, will take place June 26-27. The meeting will be held at Kananaskis
Village, a collection of resort hotels in the Rockies about 115 kilometres
west of Calgary. Security for the event will be intense.

The world leaders will be protected by a security perimeter that will extend
in a 6.5-kilometre radius around Kananaskis Village. The ground will be
patrolled by hundreds of RCMP officers and likely several thousand soldiers.

RCMP Chief Superintendent Lloyd Hickman, the officer in charge of G8
security in Kananaskis, also advised activists to steer clear of the
Kananaskis security zone for their own good.

''When people go out on a lark, to try to test the security measures ...
they're putting themselves at peril, because they are going into a tight
security zone,'' Supt. Hickman said.

Air threats will be countered by ground-to-air missiles and round-the-clock
patrols from Canadian fighter jets.

The air response will be led by NORAD (North American Aerospace Defence
Command).

Air security will be enhanced by an 80-nautical-mile no-fly security zone
around Kananaskis Village. Despite the air security buffer, Brig-Gen. Fenton
said fighter pilots will have a huge challenge dealing with rogue planes
should they enter the no-fly zone.

He said modelled air-attack scenarios show pilots will have only an
eight-minute window from the moment a rogue airliner enters the no-fly zone,
to scramble and shoot it down before it reaches Kananaskis.  ''We have very
little time -- basically eight minutes,'' Brig-Gen. Fenton said. ''It's very
very tight.'' If a rogue airplane does bear down on Kananaskis, the final
decision to shoot it down rests with Jean Chr=E9tien, the Prime Minister,
Brig-Gen. Fenton said.

However, since Chr=E9tien will be at the summit, Brig-Gen. Fenton said
shoot-down authority could be handed to a cabinet minister, possibly Art
Eggleton, the Minister of National Defence.

Brig-Gen. Fenton said soldiers will take their lead from the RCMP when
dealing with protesters, adding his troops will use an ''absolute minimum''
of force when assisting the RCMP. Some radical activist Web sites have urged
protesters to swarm Kananaskis, using roadblocks and tactics such as tree
climbing, as a way to disrupt the summit. However, most major protest groups
say they will stay far away from Kananaskis during the summit.

''It's post-Sept. 11. The thought of going into the woods, knowing there's
this kind of security force waiting, is ludicrous,'' said Natalie
Southworth, a Greenpeace spokeswoman in Vancouver. ''We want to be=
 peaceful."=20

Cheers! I agree with Nick. Better that people write bad poetry than correct
poetry. The poetry of this moment is the poetry of gutless wonders. There
are too many writing poetry just because they are rich, enough to be three
steps ahead of the repo men. Dont lose sight of the fact that we live by
murder, just bwcause someone else is doing it for us and you werent asked
anyway. Go on, write parodies--if theyre any good, they'll be better than
what you produced till now.A good poem is always a parody of  itself grace
of its feeling for form. Let's see a neo-formalist scrape the dirt back over
that, kitty. And stop threatening to quit, Nick Piombino, you are one heck
of a fine poet which means you require an expenditure of TIME to read, and
for some reason noone has got enough. It's like people just figured they are
going to die and they're going to court about it. Theyre suing their
parents. There arent enough ways left, to grow up.  David

Leonard: If you take the foregoing as a logical disagreement Joel's right
--compulsory education should be extended.

Look, I'm in and out of universities a lot in various capacities--I know
some of whereof I speak. But even if I didn't-- because presumably you've
chosen a way to live doesn't make it immune to comment. Don't worry, I'm
not trying to take the bread out of your mouth. I was trying to suggest
that one can also learn a lot in the agora. And that a problem in most
academic environments in this country is that they haven't greatly
succeeded, to the extent that they've tried at all, in engaging
intellectually with the communities around them.  A specific criticism (not
accusation).

But maybe I was too hermetic. How's this for specific? A while ago I was
invited  (as their translator) to bring three distinguished 30ish poets
from Tijuana to read at the semiaccessible university I alluded to before.
Almost no one on the lit faculty showed up, and not one faculty member from
the Spanish section. I wish I could say I was surprised.  Even within the
same field there seems to be precious little curiosity.

By the way, circular and hermetic as I am, I don't believe I engaged in ad
homina. Item: "self-proclaimed intellectual."

But since you've raised the issue, what do you think qualifies one to
consider him-her-self (or be considered) an intellectual?

Ian Hamilton's biography of Lowell is enough for understanding most of the
poems IF you have their dates (not always easy to obtain).  Hamilton has
been accused of medicalizing Lowell's poetry.  He does not do this.  To some
extent, he medicalizes Lowell's life, but a life with manic depression and
alcoholism (secondary to the MD) IS medical.  Lowell predictably got
"overenthusuastic" (his term) most summers, did nasty and then weird things,
usually ending up with a woman not his wife, and then he'd arrive manic at a
friend's house and the friend would arrange to have him committed to Mclean.
Once there, they'd drug him (too much, by modern standards) and he'd crash
into the most horrid depresion.  This is a life a mentally ill person had to
have in the fifties, even if he was incredibly rich and a well-known poet
with a sinecure-like job at that.  Thigs haven't chnaged much since then.

HOWEVER, Hamilton does not medicalize the POETRY, and there is no reason to
do so.  The creative output of mentally ill people, if they are professional
writers and not just therapy petients who have been asked to write poems to
"express their feelings," is not ill, even if it is about illness.  Even
writing which is intended to demonstrate illness (like stream of
consciousness of a person with mania or psychosis, which is something I've
occasionally tried to do but with little success) is not ill, if done right.
It is usually a lot of work to make something like that into interesting
reading (since real illness is a bore) amd to concisely capture the illness
in as few words as possible.  Whne people do this kind of porm or other
writing, often they have rewritten it many times to make it better at
coinveying the truth of the iollness than the actual tru transcript  of the
thoughts would have been.  Ab=nne Sexton literally was ahousewife with no
particular curture or education whose shrink suggested she write poetry and
you can see in her poetry that she tells hard truths well but isn't really a
creative poet and/or she is undercultured; she obviously hasn't read much
poetry or else she'd know more ways to write a poem -- there are no literary
devices in her poems of the sort that one finds in even the most basic
poetry, rarely do we find a metaphor (there are some similes, but similes
are really part of ordinary speech more than the made strange speech of
poetry) except some rather obvious structural ones, the tone is the same in
all the poems, they are ALL about how she wants to kill herself and/or how
bad she feels and/or mad at other people she is for making people feel so
bad.  The Transformations series of fairy tales are better, because she is
telling someone else's stories.  Still, the stanza from "Wanting to Die"

        but suicides have a special language
        like carpenters they wanty to know _which tools_?
        they never ask _why build_?

is brilliant, but only for its insight into mental illness, not for the
poetry...)

But a poet like Lowell is a different story.  He knew poetry and had been
writing it since before he became seriously crazy.  And he had the
discipline to write about subjects other than what he was feeling at any
particular time.  Poems such as "The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket" (still a
favorite although I don't fully understand it.  I had to memorise part of a
poem for a class and I chose the first section of this which was great fun
but I hadn't realized how hard a poem it is to recite!) are not MENTALLY ILL
poems, or mentally well poems for that matter but simply poems.  Whether he
was ill or not, he did not let his feelings seep into what he was writing
except inasmuch as they were an inspiration for the topic and tone.  But the
poem is first and foremost a poem.  Even if he was ill when he wrote it, it
isn't a symptom, it's a masterful poem.  Even the poems about his illness --
"Waking in the Blue," "The Drinker," "Speak of the Woe that is in Msrriage"
etc. are controlled creative efforts.  You can write about being crazy while
being crazy without WRITING crazy if you are a skilled writer.  Obviously
this isn't true in the worst parts of mania and depression, but one isn't
usually writing then.  But if one can write at all, and one is a genuine
poet, then one can control one's style so that the poems are not symptomatic
of anything and are fit to be judged as poems and poems alone.

The question of Notebook and History is a little more complex because he was
partly writing for himself, and he was experimenting with writing a sonnet
every single day, and also the style was a big departure from the easy free
verse of the poems between Life Studies and Near the Ocean, yet it seems to
lack the richness of his early style that gave the "Quaker Graveyard in
Nantucket" and "Adam and Eve," etc (the poems in "Lord Weary's Castle and
The Mills of the Kavanaughs).  Many people have commented on this change of
style, which is seen as a change for the worse, which coincides with his
being on Lithium for the first time.  I must admit that I used this as an
argument against taking Lithium myself ("Robert Lowell wrote bad poetry that
all sounds the same after he was put on it") and I never did take it (I take
a zillion other things but I won't touch lithium.)  However, I once tried to
read Notebook carefully and didn't get through the book but found it
strangely rewarding, like you  have to puzzle out exactly what is working in
the poem and forcus on it as you read it to yourself and then the rest comes
into focus.  It made me wonder if I was imposing more goodness onto the poem
than was realkly there or if it was really there.  And I used the Hamilton
biography (which I had alread read once) to place Lowell in his life during
the events alluded to iu the poem/the writing of the poem.
.
.
.
I took a break from reading this email and reread a bunch of Notebook.  The
poems are easier than I remembered.  I have been reading more difficult
poetry than I did when I first enountered Lowell.  Actually, I think
Notebook is more transpqrent than the earliest book, which has a few really
dense and layered poems.  Howevere you do need to know a lot that's not in
the poems to get Notebook: yoou have to know the wives & children of Lowell,
and you have to know current events from the fifties through seventies in
such a way that a vague allusion brings up the rigt event.  For example
there are some poems abou the demonstrations at the Democratic National
Convention in 1968 which is not spelled out but is clear enough if you look
at the date and read the poem carfully.

I don't see much connection between Lowell and Language Poetry.  Which of
Lowell's styles are you referring to?  pre Life Studies or Post?  And why do
criutics think Life studies was such an "improvement" because it was modern
sounding and easy...anyhow the ease is deceptive. In poems such as
"Penelope" (in Day by Day, one of my facvorite collections) you need the
same kind of knowledge to understand the poem as you might to understand the
allusions in any of the poems in Lord Weary's Castle.  It's just an illusion
that it's easy because the idiom sounds more contemporary and the
descriptive parts are more transparent.  But I doubt anyone who reads poetry
would have trouble with the descriptions in, say, The Quaker Graveyard in
Nantucket...it's the allusions and symbolism that make that poem hard, not
the imagery.

Joel: 1. Lerning curves as in curve balls? You seem to be throwing a few.
Here's one: conflating doubts about the university as a home for poetry
with anti-intellectualism is more than a little insulting. Surely you know
better. Probably most of the poets you read were only tangentially
connected to universities--think nof Pound, Williams, the Objectivists,
Olson, Duncan, Spicer, O'Hara, Ginsberg. Many of these were also doing
theory way beyond anything found in American academia at the time (altho
I'll admit a preference for the theory inherent in their ways of
working).  When a trough was opened for poets to feed at of course they
bellied up--it's nice having a source of income and maybe a little
respectability. The problem is what gets traded, and what gets lost to the
culture of poetry in general.

I write as a New Yorker who still hasn't recovered from the shock of
learning how little dialogue there is in the hinterlands. In New York, as
in all cosmopolitan cities, university affiliations are almost beside the
point--the pool of intellect and talent, and the variety of educations, not
all of them academic, that the pool brings to the discussion is enormously
wide. And its members positively shout for attention. There's a kind of
generosity in this. One wonders about other places, where the only
intellectual activity is within universities that might as well be Martian
colonies and almost no one goes in or out.

Here in San Diego there's a poetry series in an out-of-the-way university
with a serious parking problem and expensive parking fees. Without a car
one simply can't get there, except for a shuttle bus that runs from only
one point in the city, which, unless one has a great deal of time, also
takes a car to get to. Oh, and the reading is during most people's working
hours. There would seem to be a message in this.

In Paris the Ecole des Hautes Etudes at the Sorbonne sponsors open, free
public lectures by the greats of the academy. Anyone who chooses can hear
the latest research or thinking of specialists who don't talk down to their
amateur listeners.  Why should they? Half the cafes in town are informal
debating societies.

What all of this means is that the society is enriched, but so is the
university. The plethora of informal settings where passionate amateurs
gather makes for a cross-fertilization that's often missing on campus,
where people can pass years with only the most limited intellectual contact
from workers in other fields.

2. The reason there's such poor institutional memory on lists is their
nature as lists.  Memberships change. So what may be a tired and
oft-visited topic for you may be for many their first encounter with it in
this venue. Maybe you'd like to require a full reading of the archive,
followed by a test, before membership is granted.

Of course, it's possible that the discussions recur because members feel as
if their ideas have simply been dismissed. because not fullty formulated.
Discussion can be a venue for formulating ideas. That, of course, requires
that the thoughts of others be treated with respect.

1. Since, let's say, the 1982 issue of Ironwood, in which Ron Silliman
argues that realism is a relationship of writing to community, and in which
Kathleen Fraser comments on her creative writing students' semi-conscious
imitation of a "fun" "new writing" that is "liberated from the emotional
tones of high lyricism and the fussiness of the line [...] as though it
[poetry] were unholy," what has "changed" in prose, in how it is conceived
and set in relation to poetry? Why does this question not make sense, if it
doesn't, or seem out-dated, if it seems so? Pound looked to Hueffer's and
Flaubert's novelistic prose. In 1979, Silliman looks to not a particular
genre of prose, but to a theory of genre as social institution (Marxist), to
a theory of grammar ("standard" English), to a theory of linguistics
(Saussure) -- to *theories* about prose (and on behalf of poetry written by
himself, Bromige, and Watten, to mention some of those active on this
listserv). (Recent variant on theories of prose: Bernstein's "idiolect"
notion.)

2. It seems to me that the "gutless wonder" of today is not found in poetry
but in prose, and in the question of how prose is set in relation to poetry,
in order to effect / affect poetry with what prose has represented and
enacted since the emergence of the middle class (with modifications along
the way, especially in 20C by Sartre): i.e. "the world." I don't mean the
magazine. The effectiveness of discursive, critical prose in particular
seems to have most recently suffered a cataclismic reification, parallel to
historical events and technological breakthroughs since 1989. When we assert
as a common truth with Juliana Spahr today that any poem is a "social" poem,
it's not the poem that has changed, but our prose understanding of prose
(critical, pragmatic, theoretic, etc) and its relationship to the poem. When
Bernstein humorously jettisons not only the New Critical "intentional
fallacy," but the fallacy of "the poetic work" as such, when Mac Low writes
Twenties and Forties, when Brian Kim Stefans writes some poems with computer
source-base trawler programs, when DuPlessis argues for a "social philology"
of the word, when redundancy replaces repetition as the modus operandus of
mass communication language and narrative, what has changed is the
expectations we have for and about prose and what prose can do for / to /
with / as poetry. But, on the whole, these expectations for prose are not
themselves reflexively addressed, somehow (is my hunch wrong?); there is
instead an implied reliance, or faith, that prose is this way, can offer
itself this way to / as / with poetry. Perhaps these are intimations of a
future codification of prose to a point where in fact all prose will be the
footnotes or hyperlinks of poetry? But, in all this so far, it seems that
our expectations with respect to poetry haven't really changed. And it's
partly -- assuming, again, that the differential between poetry and prose
still is useful to imagine -- because of the gutless wonder that prose seems
to have become. What is prose, if its theory is poetry itself? What prose
has not been encompassed yet, that would invoke "the world"? Does "the
world" even need to be invoked in prose (blanded out as it is by the latest
empty signifier -- globalism), if every poem is the social poem? The
greatest and most worn-out cliche about prose and the reader, namely the
argument for the "productive reader," is, I think, a sign of how unfocused
our relationship to prose is (i.e. relationship to audience, reader,
reception, addressee function). The past record of this listserv is in many
ways nearest proof of an inability it seems to collectively grasp at much
other than a twinkling tinsel-thread of prose.

3. Does prose stand for "the world" today, any more than poetry does? The
answer affects how one conceives of the relationship of poetry to poetics,
for instance -- one variant of that relationship being the relationship of
"autonomy" to prose (or, the purported "distance" between poetry and
poetics), or in other words the relationship of modernist values for poetry,
to prose.

I've always wondered at how and why S. Howe is almost always singled-out,
most often with those very words: "a genuinely exciting poet." In the spirit
of candor spells relief, and under the flag of the naive reader willing to
learn from those who are genuinely curved, let me ask you, any you, why
Pierce-Arrow is not a genuinely bland book -- and I don't mean "bland" in an
exciting way. The book points, for me, to the unthought condition of prose,
and to a problem that I see -- however much I want to believe in -- Kristin
Prevallet's rendering of investigative poetics in her essay in Telling It --
Damn Straight. (How Kristin invokes such a 'istorin poetics in her own work
is another matter.)

Juliana reads from her new book Fuck You - Aloha - I Love You, as well as
more recent works. I read mostly from With Strings, my most recent book,
but also "For --" from Shade (collected in Republics of Reality).

I've also put up some other audio files, including readings of "Asylum",
"Azoot D'Puund" and "Solidarity Is the Name We Give to What We Cannot Hold"

To Barrett, who writes:

"the complaint I am raising has to do with the leveling generality of
response. The word 'langpo' itself may central to this effect. It has become
a variable whose value tends to the null set in a dysfunctional equation;
i.e., plug in the same value, get the same result."

Okay, but whose fault is this? The specificity of any collective poetic
project known as language poetry has been diluted by its own members -- see
the Bruce Andrews talk from last fall (its unspecified 'we'). Isn't this
leveling what you criticize in Bernstein's own dissemination of language
poetry in an essay like his "Poetics of The Americas"? Everyone seems guilty
of some generalization -- e.g., you in your reductive descriptions of 'the
expressive subject' in poetry and the lyric --  when they are speaking
against something. If authorship was supposed to be qualified by you and your
colleagues then how can you expect people to attend exclusively to the
specificity of particular works and their authors? The broad theoretical
claims almost always take precedence over the specific texts.
'Langpo'-ization is more attributable to those who have taught 'it', than to
those students who find themselves faced with a huge array of writing they
must respond to *properly* in order to move through it.

"The atrophy of responses may be what is wanted in order to clear the ground
for further work; this would account for the paucity of specific readings,
perhaps. But in the literary series, it is not possible to 'exit' a sequence
so easily. The Language School, in fact, has a great deal to say about
'clearing the ground' for further work."

Which is.... ?

"I'd go further and suggest that there were three 'moments' of such ground
clearing in American poetry over the last hundred years, and each took place
after a war. There's something outside the literary series, then, that
intersects with new possibility. What does the reductiveness of 'langpo' have
to do with 'exterior' logics of clearing the ground?"

It's a term of convenience like "New Americans," "Black Mountain,"
"Futurists," like any name for a group of people, "Kurds," "Crackers," except
that it's usually used in a derogatory way (and this is why you don't like
it, obviously). So, when somebody uses the term 'langpo' they tend to use it
to refer to all the bad qualities they see in the things language poets have
stood for, implicitly or explicitly. But you know that already, right? Given
time constraints and thus a premium on patience, it's sometimes helpful to
use 'langpo' rather than 'the Bernstein-Silliman-Andrews-Hejinian axis of
thought' or another combination of language poet author names.

"It seems to be completely 'internal' to the series, and thus by definition
cannot get outside, to a 'clearing.' This is another way of saying that
'langpo' is a redundant placeholder; as a response, it's the null set. It
refers to nothing except the guilt toward precedence that holds it in place.
It's a 'symptom.'"

And right there you have done what you accuse others of doing -- leveling.
All uses of 'langpo' refer to nothing but the guilt toward 'precedence that
holds the term in place'?" This is as reductive and generalizing as any
employment of the term 'langpo'.

"This is a kind of 'negative learning curve,' where we unlearn specificity
and all results tend to the same result. It can be reassuring in some
senses--what was the fuss about all along? I am going to suggest, on the
contrary, that the only way out is through, so that if a problem presents
itself to you in your development, it is necessary to go through the problem
entirely. This means learning everything about it, unfortunately for you,
rather than reducing it to a symptom-word. (Something like that is what I've
been trying to do in writing on the New Americans.) On the other hand, Millie
Niss's narrative of her experience does result in learning. This is, as
always, a very welcome communication. Why are the two learning curves so
completely opposed, as dynamics? One toward the null set, the other toward a
fullness of human understanding? Is this a tendency of the second toward the
first due to the property of the literary work, which seems to prescript and
mediate?"

Yes, there's a lot of anger among certain younger (and older) poets regarding
the prescriptiveness of language poetry and its theoretical discourse (which
tends to lead toward the null set reaction, the urge to say 'fuck it, it's a
waste of time'.) Doesn't this account for the constant flare-ups surrounding
the question of 'langpo' -- the neverending post-language crisis? Should this
surprise anyone? And why does this rage need pointing out? Is it because it's
constantly being erased from literary history (thus resulting in more rage)
as it's now being written, as in _Telling it Slant_ and your post Barrett,
which reduces human labor to an equation, another null set without a way out?

To Nick, who writes:

"To my surprise, my acquaintance Tom Orange, whose own work has on occasion
given my personal avant-garde poetics chops quite a hefty boost, was
apparently bored by EM's feminist version of an avant-garde that is not
afraid to be mutually supportive, gentle, amicable even to the point of
relating to other poets in an open and mutually supportive way about feelings
such as those of loss (mentioned by more than one person on the panel.)"

How can you say you side with the "poetics of amicability" given your callous
response to Millie Niss? It may not be criminal but your responses have
definitely not been 'gentle' or 'supportive' except in a superficial way.

"If the truth be known, I've never been the type to turn away aghast at an
exciting bit of literary gossip or debate. But this crowd was definitely not
in the mood to rise to Douglas Rothschild's inflammatory prodding's."...

Will someone email Douglas and tell him to get on the list to defend himself,
or rather explain to us his motivations for doing what he did?

"I guess I was one of the audience members most guilty of expressing certain
pacifist leanings towards certain apparently quite boring urges to discuss
things in a gentle, perhaps even quietly rational and mutually supportive
manner. Do poets have to be constantly feisty or insulting and sarcastic
towards one another to be considered brilliant, witty and amusing?"

See above. You are not discussing things in the manner you claim to want to
discuss them. You are not being quietly rational. You are being as defensive
and prodding as the next guy. There's a poetry war going on and you're part
of it, Nick.

"Let's face it-  men- and women-all too often resort to shooting things,
points and people down to in order to deal with feelings of any kind- loss or
whatever-or just to get lots of attention. Then off to the gym or the poetry
wars committee meeting."

Yes, we should face it and learn accept the psychological reality that this
is sometimes necessary. Aren't you a psychologist?

"This brings me to a related old gripe that I might as well mention, since I
'm on the topic of the poetics of aggression. I once asked Rochelle Ratner
why she supported the publishing of some vicious attacks put forth by Richard
Kostelanetz in the American Book Review (not to be confused with the American
Poetry Review) including calling Charles Bernstein a fascist and that his
book -My Way- should be compared to Hitler's -Mein Kampf-. By a strange
coincidence I had warned Charles years before of the possibility that some
weird literary character might insult him by twisting this title. When I
asked Rochelle Ratner why the ABR persisted in publishing Kostelanetz'
ravings and further responses to them in the letters section, she said  -we
need controversy to bring interest to the magazine-. Clearly the poetics of
aggression won out over the poetics of amicability at the ABR on this
occasion."

Do you think you and your colleagues -- those you identify yourself with,
i.e. other language poets -- believe in and practice a poetics of
amicability? How was the 'clearing of the ground' that occured in the 70s and
80s to happen without some aggression, some shaking things up, some
inflammatory activity? Do you really think your community is all that
inclusive?

"One of the most difficult things about being a poet has to do with the issue
of legitimizing one's work. In almost every case, as poets become more
experienced they learn to make some efforts to earn and/or acquire some form
of literary response or acknowledgement. Since L-A poetry has earned a degree
of 'name' of not 'face' recognition (there are over 750 references toit on
the Google search engine) it is no surprise that currently all kinds of
opportunities are available to find ways to exploit this to get attention.
Every since L-A poetry obtained some recognition there have many people
anxious to get attention for themselves by what came to be called
L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E bashing. But possibly the secret of the success of L-A poetry
was that the activities of these poets had more to do with creating a space
for making various kinds of experimental, or otherwise unconventional, poetry
available rather than legitimizing this or that specific poetry or style of
writing."

Probably, but it also had to do with creating a space for younger poets to
interact and create community outside of those institutions and communities
dominated by older, established poets. We need more spaces like that _now_.

"In this sense, the fake langpo website is an understandable outgrowth of the
efforts of L-A poets to create more space for experimental poetry. My
difficulty had to do with the phrase 'fake' but what the hell. I never liked
the phrase 'language poetry' much either. I think most serious poets have had
the experience of being confronted by others, frequently relatives or close
friends, who imply they are wasting their time, and that in some sense what
they are doing is -fake-. This is because only famous poets, and usually only
famous poets who have been dead a long time, can be considered -real- poets.
So, in some sense, to most people all poets except for these very few poets
who have been legitimized or, as they say, canonized, have some aura of being
fake. Most of the poets I know who have been focused on poetry every day of
their lives from 20 to 50 years appear to be quite sensitive, painfully
sensitive, to this issue of the legitimization of their activities (to be
somewhat distinguished from getting credit for the quality of their poetic
activities)."

That's part of the problem: seeking legitimization for the unconventional.
Once you get legitimacy, what you do is no longer as dangerous.

"The L-A poets I think were most successful in creating an atmosphere of
legitimizing the activity of writing unconventional poetry. You would have to
be over 50 to remember how conservative the poetic establishment was before
the activities of L-A poetry somewhat changed the atmosphere. The pressure to
write conventional poetry in order to get published was very powerful prior
to the 70's, particularly in the U.S."

It still is.

"It can be very difficult to spend a good deal of your life on something that
large numbers of people feel is a meaningless waste of time. This isn't to
say that there are not large numbers of people who feel poetry is
important.There are. But of course, there are few who feel that the career of
poet makes any sense at all."

It doesn't make any sense -- that's part of the beauty of it. It's up to you
to make it make sense.

"Once, one of my relatives said to me, when he couldn't find my telephone
number and had to check information- you can't even get your phone number
published-."

Well, that's when you gotta suck it up and tell them to stuff it. Funny
relative you got there.

"To this day, a good deal of what I experience about the public response to
poetry discourages me from wanting to continue the practice of writing poetry
at all."

The passion's got to come from you, not the 'public'. What else are you in it
for? "Well, I started to writing poetry so I could get chicks," some male
poet said a few years ago. What? When community fails me, when other people
fail me (including myself) at least I always got the poem to keep me company.
As Spicer said, you must learn to go to bed with your own tears.

"Of late I have not felt that way at all about this list, although there have
been times that I have.I don't want to do anything to discourage the
expansion of possibilities for experimental and unconventional poetry, or any
poetry for that matter. So, fake langpo people, from my point of view, go on
and fake it all you like. Just keep writing it and getting it out there."

Doesn't sound very supportive to me, Nick. Maybe the language poets are
finally starting to reap what they've sown with the arrival of fakelangpo.


And to David Bromige, who writes:

"The poetry of this moment is the poetry of gutless wonders."

Care to name some names? Be a man, put your neck on the line, and name some
names for us. Who is writing "the poetry of this moment?"

"There are too many writing poetry just because they are rich"...

That's always been the case, hasn't it.

"Dont lose sight of the fact that we live by murder."

I promise I won't, but if I ever do I'll remember that you reminded me.

"Go on, write parodies--if they're any good, they'll be better than what you
produced till now."

Who are you talking to?

"It's like people just figured they are going to die and they're going to
court about it. Theyre suing their parents. There arent enough ways left, to
grow up."

That's precisely what I thought when I read your post, David.

Unfortunately,  that designation is often used to separate the real people
from the animals. But how would I know? Not being an intellectual I can only
catch the sentimental drift.

I didn't mean to single you out, by the way. Sometimes the accumulation of
list gas just builds up and explodes.

(1) happy memorial day!... we're bbqing hamburgers... i'm putting a
slice of red onion on mine...

(2) the anti-intellectualism (and what can be just as bad,
anti-professionalism) mark w. points to is alive and well in the
u.s., hence in the university, and alive and well in english depts.,
and esp. thriving in creative writing programs (never mind town-gown
tensions)... as is the anti-multi-disciplinarity one finds operating
intradepartmentally... i.e., when i gave my "debut" reading here on
campus, not a single member of my tenure-track english dept. was in
attendance (but e.g., anselm hollo---who teaches at that little
campus on the border of our campus, naropa---was nice enough to come
by, and our visiting writer at the time, lisa jarnot, was nice enough
to come by)...

(3) ok, so anti-professionalism, from the modern language association
perspective (i.e., as addressed to the professoriat):  here's a
somewhat unorthodox view, from the current issue of ~pmla~
(publications of the modern language association), the "editor's
column" (carlos j. alonso):

"I do not think that our current situation is reversible, for its
root cause, the professionalization of the university, is merely the
academic manifestation of larger historical events and conditions
over which we hold little sway.  This is also why I am not moved by
the ever-louder complaints that we are professionalizing our students
too early.  If the increased concern with the professional dimension
of our discipline results from the loss of consensus regarding our
object of study, we cannot decry the former if we are unable to
address the latter."  (403)

now i don't entirely agree with alonso... i find it self-serving (to
put it mildly, and pragmatically) for instructors to coax their
undergrads into putting on what amount to mock-conferences that mimic
their elders' (as it were)... this form of hyper- or
turboprofessionalization risks succumbing to the top-down power play
that jeopardizes most learning situations... and i'm not quite
certain that concern over professionalization follows logically from
"loss of consensus," though i'm quite certain that, empirically
speaking (and for, again, historical reasons) the older guard, with
e.g. its attendant (let's say) humanist view of close reading (which
even some of the younger guard may share), is opposed to the younger
cultural studies troops (themselves now greying, btw), and holds them
responsible for having hyperprofessionalized their student bodies,
with all of their talk of institutional-ideological this & that
(which must of necessity, it seems, eventually take account of the
institution where said talk takes place... and which is, for the
record, fine by me)...

but what's nonetheless true, to a degree, is that the inability of
the professoriat to agree collectively as to the right and proper
object(ifications) of literary study---that is, the knowledge claims
owing thereto, and their epistemological status---has foregrounded,
if not amplified, the professionalizing pressures, b/c this suggests
at least a shared awareness that literary studies has lost its
sociocultural mooring, is foundering, can't even find suitable jobs
for its graduates, lord, Etc... i.e., both the humanist aim of
enrichment and the posthumanist aim of _______ (awareness of identity
as a construct through to social transformations of all sorts) have
been undermined or overdetermined (economically, for one) by the
functional mission of the u (one reason why "writing" becomes the
standard site of administrative incursion is b/c it can presumably be
understood as a form of quantified, functional enrichment---e.g.
"excellent" prose)... which functional mission can't be any longer to
nationalize a citizenry (or at least, this form of ideological
saturation job is held at arm's length these days by many if not most
english studies practitioners, though here again there's something of
an old-new guard split)...

so what you have in the wake of all of this is a professional
quarrel, cutting any number of ways and usually in the midst of
funding cutbacks, over the very terms of legitimacy of a field that,
aside from a reductively narrow view of "writing" and literacy (i've
read my bowles & gintis long ago, yes), can't be shown, close reading
or reception theory or what have you, to do any but raise awareness,
or occasionally delight, or provoke, or provide a space for creative
articulation, or challenge the status quo, all through various
objectifications of culture (incl. literature, or not incl.
literature)---none of which, however much you may venerate same, is
likely to be measured in dollars and cents, jobs, spreadsheets etc...
in a word, it's all so UNprofessional, save for the labor of the
professoriat as such, and any attempt at professionalizing same, at
helping students to understand their would-be professional selves
(which includes instruction in "theory," yes, but all too often fails
to account for the commodification of same), will likely be greeted
as a departure from the age-old coordinates that have already been
undermined or overdetermined by... i.e., will likely be viewed
askance by the *public* in particular, b/c the specialized knowledge
known by professionals (something that haunts e.g. the more populist,
business-bound underpinnings of fields like engineering) is not
presumed as a rule of thumb to be known by those who study something
as delight-ridden as a book, or a poem...

which, to use an entirely overworked term, constitutes something of a
crisis... or am i "reading too much into this"?...

(4) what i've written in (3) might have something to do with what's
going on on this list (and e.g. louis's intriguing account of
prose-poetry diametrics intersects somewhat in fact with what i'm
saying about "writing," in that "prose" has become the status quo
measure of the institution that would seek to define and delimit
english studies)... in our failure to develop a consensus over our
object of study/discussion (poetry), and amidst funding cutbacks and
generally difficult artistic circumstances, we likewise start to
assign factional blame... "it's you and your kind who have brought
poetry to its regrettably balkanized state"... academics (.edu) being
so obviously prevalent, we're an easy target, and as we're clearly
professionalized (never mind intellectual), we clearly presume to
know some specialized knowledge, and to form our communities
accordingly---more fuel for the bonfire (yeah, of the vanities)... i
mean, we're quite literally "schools," yes, if not exactly schools of
poetry, and we're presumed to make poets in our own fishy images...
no denying this is true, of course, even if someone has to do the
dirty work (i.e., whether you believe in creative writing per se as
an academic field of study---and why not?---the study of literature
is surely worth pursuing, and someone has to teach same, and those
who can, do)...

but e.g., i know a number of poets, good poets and good people, who
make an absolute killing off of the banking industry, the real estate
industry, etc... i woulda thunk, given the class datum and popular
hostility to the well-heeled (if not filthy rich), that my current
and all-time high of $45K would have given less offense than the real
estate poet's $100K+ (i mean, i'm pushing 50 and i'm still
renting---and i'm not living in nyc, thank you very much)... but i
guess my thunking is not shared by everyone...

(5) so anyway... believe me, i've seen the bad sides and good sides
of the hallowed halls---but they're no less vital for that... the
question for me will continue to be how to reform same (i.e., as long
as i keep earning my keep courtesy of same)... but i would really
prefer it were the critique of academia to be tempered by a little
critique, at least once in a while, of your *own* respective
industries, some of you, so i wouldn't feel as if someone were
stomping on my livelihood, or head, just for the halibut... how does
poetry as a practice relate to your work as an investment counselor,
or do you regard it as sheer escape from same? (if the latter, we
need to talk)... but maybe that's asking too much?...

hey, have a good day----

best,

I've been a Public Health Sanitarian for 25 years.  I inspect restaurants,
grocery stores, rental housing, swimming pools, food vending machines,
schools.  I do follow-up on animal bites, nuisance complaints.  I work in a
mosquito control program, a rodent control program and an industrial
pretreatment program.  I'm thinking a lot lately about West Nile virus which
will probably have its first human cases in Ohio some time this summer.  I'm
also thinking about bioterrorism.  The Feds are going to give our Dept. $8000
to combat bioterrorism.  What the hell does that mean?

My job is stressful, challenging and political.  It has taught me things
about listening and translating that I might not have learned otherwise.  I
hate this job.  But I'm good at it.  And I'm weirdly proud of that.  I've
worked hard.

Few people here in town know that I'm a poet.  Most people I know don't know
how to reconcile the idea they have of poetry with the person they know as
me.  This speaks to only one dimension of my alienation.

Somehow, though, I wrote some poetry, edited a magazine, etc., without much
support.

When I was an undergraduate at Kent State I was offered a position as a
graduate assistant in Italian.  I turned the offer down, feeling that I was
somehow inadequate to teach.  Teaching seemed to me such an awesome
responsibility .  I didn't trust my ability to do it.

Poetry, for me, is SEX--the release that comes from YOU-the-unknown.

hey tom, that's pretty cool, thanx... a job's a job, but you sound
like a PRO at what you do, if you get my drift... whereas to be a pro
in a learning institution might (just might) consist of providing
instruction in how to understand the quandaries of professionalism
(there is blurring here twixt the thing that is taught and the
profession that teaches, yes), i daresay most who are pros at what
they do manage to illuminate same at least for themselves... problem
with higher ed (to return there for a moment), as indicated by the
circularities i was busy circulating in the 1st of my two daily (and
in this case, memorializing) posts, is that the sort of functional
professionalism being demanded (almost by fiat) of college graduates
today is at odds both with humanist and posthumanist thought (as it
were)... and the only way i know how to allay same is to change the
way classrooms are structured...

but i'm really interested in what you do, esp. insofar as i would
think such work needs must situate your writing (if for you alone)...
i mean, you have such a public, even civic profile, on the one hand,
that i would think the fact of you're being a poet *would* be, in
your case, a source of productive conflict (public v. private,
say)... i'm interested in the way poetry is sublimated by occupation,
or (i would presume, depending on the moment) vice versa... again,
b/c i'm an academic, most folks figure that what i do for a living
speaks so goddamn directly to what i do as a poet... well,
sometimes!---and no, i wouldn't trade places with anyone,
occupationally speaking (excepting that guy who floats around on his
pool all day on an inflatable crocodile, sipping gin 'n tonics)...
but aside from the classroom (which does and does not inform my
practice as a poet), the work i do is often so bureaucratically
informed... i mean, even filling out my "faculty report on
professional activities" (frpa on this campus), the basis upon which
my raise is determined...

hey, i really like this quote from dewey, think i'll use it at the
front of the next book i publish, if i'm lucky enough to publish a
next book:

>If Greek philosophy was correct in thinking of knowledge as
>contemplation rather than as a productive art, and if modern
>philosophy accepts this conclusion, then the only logical course is
>relative disparagement of all forms of production, since they are
>modes of practice which is by conception inferior to
>contemplation.... But if modern tendencies are justified in putting
>art and creation first, then the implications of this position
>should be avowed and carried through.  It would then be seen that
>science is an art, that art is practice, and that the only
>distinction worth drawing is not between practice and theory, but
>between those modes of practice that are not intelligent, not
>inherently and immediately enjoyable, and those which are full of
>enjoyed meanings.... Thus would disappear the separations that
>trouble present thinking:  division of everything into nature *and*
>experience, of experience into practice *and* theory, art *and*
>science, of art into useful *and* fine, menial *and* free.
>

Subject:      Prose domination, Howe's value, & lyric ca. 2002
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Some violent simplifications in the interest of seeing what's new about the
present:

Poetry since the late 1960s has been dominated by prose, only we don't call
it prose.  We call it "speech," or we call it "writing."

In the former case, there is an attempt to objectify (as "voice") the
author's individuality, without pathos or self-dramatization.  Pinsky, for
example.

In the latter case, individuality is objectified only at the level of
writing style, and the work has only an obscure or fabricated relation to
its author.  Perelman, for example.

But both tendencies imply a quarrel with the traditional promise of the
lyric.  Lyric promises intensity.  Though in vastly different ways, Pinsky
and Perelman are clearly uneasy or dissatisfied with the idea of lyric
intensity (which isn't to say they are merely genial fellows).  In general,
poets who came to maturity in the late 1960s prefer charm, or sympathy, or
comedy, or word games, or theory -- things better handled with the more
social medium of a prose-like poetry.

This is one reason, it seems to me, why Susan Howe is notable.  She has an
unironic relation to lyricism, even if she must borrow it from other
speakers, most of them speakers of prose.  She has found a way to intensify
and transform prose so that it becomes lyric.  Lyric intensity is something
she shares, though in vastly different ways, with Frank Bidart.
Extremists, both of them.

The move to a more social (i.e. prose-like) poetics may have been good for
poetry, but I wonder whether younger poets aren't moving in a different
direction, trying to reclaim for poetry some of the things given away in
the effort to be more social.  Maybe they should try to be less social,
less accommodating.  If so, I wonder what the key texts would be.

from "Fear of an Empty Life" from THE SENSE RECORD

Along the imprint of a smooth utterance a single adhesive
word slips away, snuggles beside the accusatory newborn
thought which, barking from lack of care, might trap in a moment
of serious sorrow me and my dirty heart, we twist the arm
of friendship 'til the ancient swing of the nonchalant body
is rewritten as a trembling, angry, grudge. Split along
the physique axis of wrested love and that human pulp
the wealthy mock, old need, a shuffle from the coffin lip
silences mind into fiddleheaded body, bobbing in the fifty-fifty
sheets, weighty yet so pitiful it cannot coax solution--- Darwin
was a fool, conductor of teeming masses, I see them now
in sedimentary patterns, crushed umber colors and a hint of green.

Joe: I could recite what I learned from my careers as a film maker,
university teacher,  social worker and therapist, art dealer, and editor,
and they all inform my work. More interesting, I think, is what I learned
in switching from the one to the other.  Each have their limitations and
impositions--one doesn't simply practice a profession, one becomes
socialized to it. I don't think one can fully appreciate that change
without experiencing it.

The change can be quite startling and quite painful. To take for a moment
university teaching as baseline (and only for a moment and not in much
detail--most people on the list are familiar with universities), one has a
far greater control of one's sleep and wake schedule than in most jobs, but
there are particular decorums to adhere to.  Wild expressions of enthusiasm
usually have to be reserved for after hours. All those manic depressive
artists we read about are encouraged to keep a lid on it.

Regardless of  social class of origin, academics tend to live in academic
ghettos, which may be why so much of main stream poetry takes place in
low-affect, pastel suburbs. And why so much of the more rebellious
poetry  seems very safe.

The point is that how we live and how we make a living involves change to
conform to the environment in which we do these things. When I became a
psychiatric social worker and therapist the external circumstances included
non-negotiable hours, rigid dress-codes anjd very little time for
interaction with other professionals in the field--one was mostly locked
away with patients or doing paperwork. There was also a sort of asceticism:
one quietly (quietly even when speaking) focused on every means of
expression in the room--the war between affect and body language and
verbalization, the dynamic between patient and therapist, the impact of
patient on therapist (why did I react this way to a particular event? do
most people in the patient's life react this way? what do I do with this
knowledge that may help the patient?), the interactions, sometimes for the
therapist's benefit, between members of a couple or family (I remember one
session in which the father was talking to me while his combative daughter
as if by accident made it quite clear that she wasn't wearing panties, for
instance). The emphasis was on the things--all of them--of the moment and
on the particularities of one's own response to them, and on one's self as
just another one of those things. Quite a dance. It's how I learned that
the self is the last thing one has to worry about--write down the objects
and the self is apparent. Especially if one tries to evade expressing it
through the imposition of randomness.

I love teaching, and I teach with a therapist's attention. I also love the
other things I've done. The question, I think, is what happens when one
spends an entire working life doing the one thing, with its external and
internal demands, when one is shaped by it, and when most of the colleagues
who surround one have spent most of their working lives in the same way.
Then make the one environment the site in which whole generations of poets
work. Then isolate the individual workplaces from contact with thinking
feeling creative workers in all the other available fields, all of them
shaped differently by all of those daily and decades-long labors.

I'm aware that universities are as diverse as mental health clinics or
carpentry shops. I'm also aware that they are more similar to each other
than they are to clinics or carpentry shops. That's why it's less of a
disruption to change acdademic posts than to take the same skills into,
say, the business world.

What's all this about (I do ramble, but hopefully not in a circle). I'm
worried that poetry threatens to be constricted by the relative uniformity
of the places in which it operates. If I'm right the problem for poetry is
not only the nature of the univerity but its growing monopoly.

[Herman Melville goes to the Dean. "I need six months off to hide in a
rooming house in Manhattan and rewrite this whale of a book--I'm really
stuck, I need a change of scene." Dean: "Well, you can apply for a
sabbatical in about three years--you might even get one if we think the
project has merit." Herman: "I'm not sure I can wait that long. In fact,
it's now or never. I'm on fire. I can't eat or sleep. Maybe I can just take
some unpaid time?" Dean: "Maybe, but don't expect that sort of thing to
help your career.  We tend to appreciate faculty who are committed to the
institution."

Next faculty meeting as the group is about to get down to business a
colleague greets Melville. "How's the book going, Herman?" Odd duck, the
colleague thinks, tends to keep to himself. Herman: "All visible objects,
man, are but as plasterboard masks. But in each event--in the living act,
the undoubted deed--there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts
forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If a
man will strike, strike through the mask!" Emily Dickenson, from across the
room (she teaches poetry workshops, but she probably woin't get tenure): "I
had a terror since September, I could tell to none: and so I sing, as the
boy does of the burying ground, because I am afraid."  Colleague, to
himself:  "Sorry I asked."]

Interesting post on prose/poetry, Louis, but is there now not another
element here - the visual, if not other dimensions.  For example the
Gene(sis) exhibition seems to of interest (per the NYTimes) and it seems to
have included most everything but poetry and prose about poetry?

On another black/white dichotomous thought process I have yet to encounter
anything that confronts the aesthetics or poetics of emotions although Eigen
is making a move in this direction.  What I mean is that this is often dealt
with as confessional/non-confessional, workshop/non, etc. with the nasty
feelings then easily slipped out the window.

As Millie's recent venture has shown once again, it's all too easy to think
dichotomously (them/us) rather thenengaging dialogically.

On another tangent, I have concluded that I have gotten too many books to
devour so will add a review section to the next _Metaphor/Metonym for Health
http://trbell.tripod.com/metaphor/metapho.htm when I manage to revamp and
resituate it, so let me know if you are interested.

In keeping with my new direction, I'd be interested in hearing from a visual

Milie.  In a subtle sense, what you have done  (your "report" of your
experiences) is almost a kind of poem...it has that intensity, but - I was
moved by what you have written, and I am also dubious of news reports and
pseudo scientific "discooveries" linking madness to art...it may be that
some of the "unreal" or "disordered" thinking has some relation or echoes of
certain creative writing: John Berryman wrote his brilliant sonnets almost
as desperate attempt to maintain his sanity (and there is an interesting
discussion on the role of the personal (at various degrees of intrusion or
intensity into a poem) in "Introspection and Contemporary Poetry" by Alan
Williamson).  But there is no way of knowing that Berryman (or many others
who were supposedly "mad" ) would not have written greater poetry if thay
were
just happy: I'm not eliminating suffering which we all have in our lives in
various ways. Suffering can be humbling and enlightening: but certain things
are just too horrible - I think that that's why we tend to abstract things
 no wars would be fought if we could feel veryone else's pain all the
time!): and Yeats even writes about that process (he had a tendency toward
some rather dark and strange notions) my son has had tragedy in ihs life and
was diagnosed "schizophrenic" and so on: he was not very academic as they
say but these days he is doing quite well as my ex wife joined him to weight
watchers (which  I also joined by the way) and he lost a lot of weight:
walks every where, plays games on game cubes, meets with his half brother
each weekend and is generally much happier than he was...I also had a
nervous breakdown (as it was called when I was young) (I was 19) and I
became enormously obsessed with death: and in that state of mind which went
from extreme anxiety to a deep depression I couldnt even listen to music (I
remember that I could watch the adverts on TV: they I found comforting!!)
But by using valium and anti-depressants I came right as they say, got
marrried, have three children: in fact (I boast) I am a grandfather as of
six weeks!
    I'm not a horrible advocate of suicide boombing or anyhing: a lot of
those
political things I say people can take with a pinch of salt, I would
"support" such things in the sense that they were acts of desperation if
that's what they are (but whatever their result in political terms they are
horrific if viewed in islolation): I did go through a "political" period but
it was like the Williams poem about the crowd at a baseball game, as a
professor of mine said, people lose themselves in the crowd: its a way of
evading or "cheating" death...so one can "lose oneself" in a cause or by
becoming a fanatic....there's a fine line between that last and enthusiasm
or dedication...and I dont suppose there's anyone anywhere who hasnt been
near the edge so to speak...
   I think we all need to have more compassion for each other and
understanding of others: life is and can be tragic enough...but autumn is a
still a beautiful season "of mists and mellow fruitfulness"... we do at
least have the potential power to make ourselves and others happy or at
least
fight to choose not to be unhappy...which I realise in your case is a hard
one: but worth a try as, if you could be free of the torment and the drugs
you would be free to do great things as they say: but for now just keep on
with what you are doing, your writing: the big projects ,well you're not
alone
on that, I can never think of anything to write about so I mainly just
write "crazy" short prose poems!! [(By the way I also wanted to  talk about
your "bafflement" of language peotry: it is also a common reaction, but that
such poems dont (or dont seem to make) sense is problematic, as after all
that opens up the whole question of meaning  difficulty (and the various
kinds of difficulty) and the meaning of meaning) bt I'll write about that
more later] I'll send this to the List as I think it has value this question
...
  It was a topic before and I think it should stay and or be revisited (it
began before with a discussion of Hannah Weiner's "visionary" poetry. I
think that human suffering can be generative but it has to be mixed with a
sense of well being. I cant write if I dont feel well physically or well in
myself.
  I think the point is that there are many  people who are "normal"
(whatever that is) who are not insane and probably many people who are both
"very bright" AND plodders like myself who have experienced some form of
mental distress of or illness. Dr Wayne Dyer comments in "Your Erroneous
Zones" that intelligence heeds to be redefined:  "...At the  top of the list
is the
notion that intelligence is the ability to solve complex problems....yet the
mental hospitals are clogged with patients who have all the properly
lettered credentials - as well as many who dont. A true barometer of
inteligence is an effective, happy life lived each day and each moment of
each day.
  If ou are happy, if you live each moment for everything it's worth, then
you are an intelligent person. "   [ He's not ignoring those things that
it would be bizarre to be unmoved by or extemely unhappy about: a death of a
loved one
and so on...he's not talking here of things in extremis: but the attitude of
mind that struggles to deal with difficulties as effectively as possible,
knowing that not all things are "cureable"..]

But in general the concept of thinking oneslef as "successful" if happy is a
good one. And I think that a happy and thus a sane (from Latin for  health
L= sanus from memory) person is generally someone who is also
more creative: we all are or can be so. Richard

        This may be the case, but I run into many people who just right poetry.
Granted most not relevant to current poetics but it is alive outside of
academia. Look at the number of people on Poetry dot com. Most have funny
ideas about what a poem should be but that's fine. Ask around and you shall
find friends - poetry like coca cola is for everyone :-)

Hi,

A couple of people from the list have written saying they've received
a suspicious attachment from Kevin Killian or an email with a virus
in it.  Both had bizarre but banal subject lines.

Checking the full header of one of these emails, it originated not
from Kevin nor Earthlink, but from primushost.com.  Kevin's email is
merely being used as bait.

So, if you receive any suspicious attachments from Kevin (or anybody
else)--don't open them.  Throw them away immediately and report the
abuse, as we did to the originating host.

Thanks.

thanks for the response...I havent read the i'view twixt Smith & Dorn, tho'
shd like to. But being of Ed's generation, and patchily workingclass, I have
like expressions gathering dust on the same memento shelf.
                 Years since, having been offended by Dale Smith's
unquestioning adoration of Tom Clark, I posted an hostile note and Smith hit
back, though way off-target. Even his wife got in on the fun, e-assuring me
her husband was a great person and even greater poet.
                    I am glad for her that subsequwnt events are said to
have realized her faith in him,and glad for all of us who love poetry that
we may find this the case. Then, I resented being treated like a cardboard
cutout of a Language Poet, while being presented with a CC of a Tom Clark
clone. Email has a lot to answer for, altho' it won't. End o' footnote.

Hello again David,
I didn't know anything about that little skirmish. I
was just interested in the coincidence. I had
literally just read the interview with Ed Dorn - it's
here:
http://www.skankypossum.com/pouch.htm#dorn
and by "from five years ago" - I meant - that was when
the interview took place.
All the best,
Pam

They say ouch.

In previous versions, there's a fallen Catholic, a rabbi, and a vegetarian--

They also walk into a bar.

Ouch.  Oy vey.  Nader.

If a given poet can really put herself to it and write something that connects
with readers concerning pain, well, those are the poems I'm waiting for/starving
for.  What bugs me about the American-confessional movement was just how
contrived it was-- worry about yr worldview and morals, write poems about your
car and your house and your wife/husband.  Granted, this was the 1950's/1960's,
but other American poets were doing much more interesting things beyond the
fringes of a burgeoning therapeautic-esthetic.  Robert Lowell wrote some good
poems, but he made a career out of his upper-middle-class "suffering," and it
became pathetic.  Literally, he had nothing left.  Was and remains pathetic
(pathetique?/ I went to public school.)

I think poetry does a better job among genres regarding the exploration of the
personal, interior, quiet conflicts that we all have to deal with-- I also think
American poetry is absolutely fucking paralyzed by a notion that _this_ is all
there is left to discuss/examine.  It's given an excuse for so-called
academically affiliated poets to write books about nothing but themselves, their
divorces, their kid's diapers, and then point a finger at poets who aren't
somehow "authentic" enough, because they didn't go to Harvard and have those
damn qualms-- the ones that make you drink yrself to death or jump in front of a
truck or jump off a bridge or turn on the gas-- yes, these are sad things, but
ultimately, American poetry right now suffers from a legacy of miserable, naive
analolgy-- a given poem should connect with an assumed emotional geographic
position of "the suffering person," or even worse, the ironically recognized
"suffering poet"--

When there are ten- to 1,000 millions of other events occuring-- and they have
everything and nothing to do with the first-person event of recognition and
meditation--

Nick and Listers. I agree with the guts of this: in fact the "attack" on
language Poetry comes from either  those who - like Millie - are I think new
to it and rather baffled and feel (as I did when I "discoverd" Ashbery
having got "back in" to poetry) that because I couldnt "figure it out" that
I was stupid (mind you that experience was also mine when I first
encountered Eliot, Pound and Auden (altho the humorous and "camp"aspects
(altho that latter term I knew not then) "saved the day"also (!)) as a young
man: and I still find a lot of poetry, of whatever ilk "difficult" but as
(forget who but Scroggins refers to him in his book on Zukofsky)) X points
out that there are different kinds of difficulty eg the difficulty might be
knowing certain informational things re the poem that the poet either
expects the reader to know or figure out, or the poem might be constructed
in  a very complex way (either formally or in the sense of the "narrative
thread"  or the complex of ideas) or the difficulty in the case of language
Poetry may have to do with one's expectations of what poetry is (which is
one of the things that Language poetry does).  As you say ...it was a
movement and I dont think we should trivailise it: most of the writers in In
the American Tree and the many others that Ron mentions there are very fine
and original writers: I have one of your books, I have had great enjoyment
from eg CB's "Paradise" (or was that Silliman but certainly they are both
excellent writers and thinkers) ...my only crit might be a certain dourness
sometimes (but then that crit could be applied to all sorts of styles and
"schools" ): and the other kind are those who think its all too "old hat"
wheras they are wrong it initiated all sorts of "offshoots" (of which
Millie's thing might be another who knows): and it freed things up: as well
as that thee was a concentration on theory whicch I feel is very much what
made the Romantics most interesting especially (but not only ) via Coleridge
(of cousre I know that theory and practice are interconnected and he/she is
also a theoretician who "sinply" writes and does): we forget the radicality
of Creeley, Wiliams, Stevens, Moore (Stein of course) Olson, Zukofsky,
Niedecker, Ashbery especially of "Tennis Court Oath" (although I love his
"Self Portrait..."),Ammons, Bishop and in  New Zealand our own Kendrick
Smithyman. There are many others and many movments and I think there are
interrelationships...it is true that somewhat the Language Poetry ideas have
been "subsumed" (parataxis and "disjunction" etc but that is a good thing:
the question of it being identifiable by words with lots of whie space:
ell  - to Millie - you must have a look at Mallarme's experiments in open
form done in the 19th Century, and those of Appollinaire - and later
Olson..but there were many others: in some ways cummings contributed: but
aside form formal experimentation: language poetry has concentrated on the
word, the sentence, the concept block as I term it: also the breaking of the
language, the torquing as some refer to it, introduces and emphasises that
central significance of poetry its power to enchant, to baffle: in fact the
"foregrounding of the signifier" is what has been done by many other poets
previously but the Language Poets and the thinking around and about language
based poetry made poetry (possibly an "art" that is a kind of
thnking/creating/philosophising which drives to the heart of the light) very
significant (if to some apparently less popular) and also pardoxically made
it seem "difficult"  but much of that (elitist is another term thrown at it)
difficulty is in not so much its deciphering (although looking at the
strategies etc and the actual meaning structures yields a lt less
"senselessness" than appears: athough language Poetry also gives me I feel
"permission", as Wystan Curnow termed it once in conversation with me, to
experiment - lash out linguistically in any way i want - but also the
difficulty is partly knowing "where these guys are coming from" (by guys i
mean guys and gals) ... but another thing: some fairly in depth knowledge of
poetry and lit helps not so much to "understand" lang poetry but as a way
in: the difficulties are thus those of some knowledge that needs to be
gained...especially some knowledge of its history and where it is/was
"going" some of the theoretical influences and so on: but there is also the
other difficulty  .. the ontological difficulty (dont worry dear readers I
struggle with big words like that!)..which is that you have to be aware of
certain ways of truth telling: you have to be open...like someone prepared
to listen to Country and Western or any other music right up to Charles Ives
and Stochausssen and on to anything being done right now: similar goes for
art): the difficulty the reader puts in his own way because somehow they
cannot "think poetically" or dont let certain things in (maybe dont "let
themsleves" think poetically)....one thinks of Keats's "negative
capability": I think that Listers who havent "should" (I dont like using
that word) read or buy (in order to read!) In the American Tree and the
essays of such as Silliman, Bernstein, Nick yoursel(!) a (albeit you cme
from a rater difficult - there's that word again -  or should I say almost
Heideggenarianly abstruse "tadition" of a type of writing!, Perloff,
Heijinian, Howe, Watten and many others: the two books by Hank Laser are
good and are about language poetry: its a vital, a powerful movment and is
still alive and Nick you are a considerable writer. Power on!
  Another opposition comes form those who are very conservative both
poetically and probably politically: all they want is (often) some idea of
poetry...something transparent with metre that rhyms about a dying flower:
but THAT doest say that certain kinds of simplicity ... or that any kind of
writing at all is not valid: the Language Movement made serious this
adventure of consciousness which is poetry at its best: it foregrounded the
anbiguity (carrying on the work of many others of the moderns including
Empson and so on) and uncertainty: but also simultaneously new forms and
structures  evolved or are were evolving and there is hardly one
practitioner who is not quite different each from each: Susan and Fanny Howe
are both great poets but qute difffernet I think, and Heijinian coulnd't be
mistaken for Clark Coolidge, or Bruce Andrews for Michale Gottleieb
(although he could be said to be closer to Siliman) and Bernstein is
protean, and who could be crazier and as original (especaily for the time he
wrote) than Grenier...I wish i had time to read more of Carla
Harryman..there's Benson, Bromige,Greenwald, and Barrett Watten..so many: a
huge range of talented writers: the a Language Project is I feel still alive
and kicking with - sure - people "attacking" (but that's probably a good
thing in a way)..it has certainly helped me in my own writing alhough I also
looked to certain British, European and of course NZ writers.  And  in NZ
Wystan Curnow, Michelle Leggott, Alan Loney, somewhat Richard von Sturmer,
Murray Edmond have been significantly influenced and are all very talented:
but there are also a number including Scott Hamilton, Michael Arnold, Hamish
Dewe who have taken notice as has Jack Ross: others are John Geraets,
Michael Radich
and many who have appeared in Geraets and Loney's "Brief" (Originally "A
Brief Hisatory of the Whole World")....also there are obviously a lot of
influence that has gone to Australia: I'm not talking slavish worship of
"Big bad  America" though!! But I feel, seriously, that it, the Language
Project is and was highly important:and very generative. Richard Taylor.

Have fun in Cali.  Keep it real.  Also, I think that I find many of the d=

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS:
Deadline: June 15th, 2002

NEW TRANSLATION: THE JOURNAL OF LITERARY TRANSLATION

It is my pleasure to announce the return of Translation to
publication, as New Translation, beginning with a first issue
scheduled to appear in September 2002. Translation, the Journal of
Literary Translation, enjoyed a distinguished run from its inception
in 1970 until 1994. During that time, it introduced English language
readers to hundreds of writers representing scores of languages
around the globe, and served an important role in enlarging the
vision of our sometimes linguistically parochial culture.

A modest change in the journal's name seemed fitting given the lapse
of time since the journal last appeared and since its reappearance
occurs under new editorial hands. It is my hope, also, that the "new"
indicates a vigorous commitment to bringing to the attention of our
readers writers who have been little or not at all heard from in
English, and to advocating the riches of literatures that have gone
under-appreciated and under-represented in translation. New
Translation will thus serve additionally to complement the
tremendous rise of postcolonial studies -- a rise which has drawn
attention to problems of globalization, to "minor" literatures (in
Deleuze's sense), and inevitably to issues of translation and
cultural exchange.

It is my further hope that the "new" will speak to a commitment to
develop in the pages of the journal a forum for addressing and
exploring the frontiers of the art of translation in theory as well
as practice. We live in a time when the artistic abundance beyond our
linguistic border is staggering. We live, too, in a time
when the catastrophic consequences of ignorance or intolerance of
what is outside our cultural orbit must be painfully apparent to
all of us. I believe that New Translation has an important role to
play in helping us to enjoy that abundance and to absolve us of that
ignorance.

The editors of New Translation are pleased to acknowledge the generous
financial support of the Thornton Wilder Foundation and the general
support of the School of the Arts at Columbia University. We are
presently accepting manuscripts for the first two issues of the
journal of translations into English from all other languages, living
and not, in all genres, including but hardly limited to poetry,
fiction, theatre, essay, and criticism. We also welcome original work
which concerns the practice, history or art (or science) of
translation, including discussions of translation as it obtains to
such matters beyond the immediately literary as music, film and
our often logocentric visual arts. Manuscripts should be received no
later than June 15, 2002 for consideration for the September issue.
Authors are promised a response to submissions within six weeks of
receipt of their manuscripts. Original language texts are welcome to
accompany submissions, but not required. Submissions may be
sent either as manuscripts to the address below, or electronically to
newtranslation@columbia.edu (preferably as an MS/Word attachment).
Inquiries can also be made to my attention at rjm49@columbia.edu.

Arras: new media poetry and poetics is devoted to exploring how digital
technology has impacted the field of experimental poetics.  This includes the uses of digital technology to expand the techniques that
poets use - whether this be in multimedia, interactivity, algorithmic
processes, and digital typefaces - as well as how the web can serve as an
alternative distribution source for texts both of poetry and criticism.  A feature of the site is the irregular appearance in Adobe Acrobat format of
the poetry journal Arras - including poetry, interviews and criticism -
which is a continuation of the print journal of that name and is not
necessarily concerned with digital technology.  This is also my homepage, so links will be added as my writing and web works
go online.  Arras does not accept submissions of either poetry or digital works. Calls
for theme issues of the .pdf journal will be made periodically. I'm happy to
look at URLs of new media poetry, but my goal is to keep the set of
"gallery" links highly focused on the specific issues that are important to
me at the moment. Links will be added and dropped over time to reflect these
interests.

One of the most exciting and interesting things about this group of poets
has been the length of time many have remained very interested and
supportive of each others work. In some cases this is approaching 30 years.
Many of these poets have become publishers themselves and are publishing
younger poets in increasingly large numbers, including Lyn Hejinian and
Leslie Scalapino. David Bromige worked closely with Cydney Chadwick to bring
out Avec when it was first being published- Cyd was a student of David's.
Ron Silliman has been a source of constant support and publisher of
countless writers, as has Douglas Messerli, James Sherry , Peter Ganick,
Stephen-Paul Martin, Richard Royal and Eve Ensler, Leland Hickman, Dubravka
Djuric and Misko Suvakovic,  Clayton Eshleman, Tom Beckett, Jena Osman
Juliana Spahr, Rod Smith, Paul Vangelisti, Rob Fitterman, Elizabeth Fodaski,
Mark Wallace, Standard Schaefer, Andrew Levy, Bob Harrison, John Byrum ,Tom
Bynum, Manuel Brito, Emmanuel Hocquard, Bob Perelman, Paul Hoover and Maxine
Chernoff, Steve Clay, Rosemarie and Keith Waldrop, Peter Holland and Jeanne
Lance, Rod Smith, Maryann Caws, Patrick Durgin and many others.  Barrett
published- This- magazine and- Poetics Journal- and edits -Crisis/America-.
Charles Bernstein edited many anthologies, created and maintains this list
and has encouraged countless poets in and out of Suny/B, the list could go
on and on. You make an important point by clarifying that aggression has a
crucial role to play in poetry communities and in a poet's relationship with
others. What I don't believe in, and I don't think most language poets
believe in, is unexamined and unmitigated aggression. You are right to
remind me that the 'clearing of the ground' could not have taken place
without some conflict and  open aggression. But as for being 'inclusive' I
am going to predict that the language group of poets will be found, when the
histories are written, to be unique in its efforts to go beyond local
dynamics and to widen the circle of connection between writers and readers
outside and within official academic communities. This group of writers from
its beginning constantly worked to connect beyond local circles on a
national and later on an international level including writers in Canada,
China, Russia, Italy, France,Japan, Spain, the Canary Islands, Brazil,
Sweden and elsewhere. But as far as inclusivity, I think there has always
been a conscious bias towards writers who innovate and embrace
unconventional forms of writing.

This sounds a bit harsh. Have I really been all that defensive and prodding?
Anyway, to the extent that I have, I am glad to be confronted so I can
continue to try to be less so. I look forward to working to discourage war
of any type.

Legitimizing one's writing means having it be taken seriously. That's when
it becomes 'dangerous'(i.e., powerful) on a much wider front, though perhaps
in a somewhat more diluted way than at the outset when it was less widely
known.

mark, thanx for your response... part of my beef---and i suppose i
have to say, again, that i spent 7 solid years working as an
engineer, in various (and i mean various) capacities, so i can dig
the career change argument (esp. as, during a good portion of this
latter stretch, i was supporting my dad, and as, tut, i was a senior
engineer at 26---which means i buckled down in that career while
under serious duress)---part of my beef about the anti-academic stuff
is that the scenario you depict is not one i've ever enjoyed, as you
depict it... academia may be more like academia than working in
factories, but there would seem to be something of a genetic fallacy
at work here... i mean, sometimes the apple falls a good distance
from the tree...

fact is that the university is less a threat to poetry than a threat
to thought as such---meaning, a threat to a better world (to the
extent that poetry is about thought, and better worlds, makes it a
subset of this problem)... i've written about this, i think you know,
by paralleling my having been denied tenure (i.e., canned) at my last
place of employ via much the same logic by which bristol-myers canned
me in 1984 (that piece, which appeared in ~postmodern culture~, was
edited down by the pmc folks to include less of the parallel detail
than i would have liked, but it still does the trick)... the problem
i address there has to do, i'd say, with (the late) bill readings's
argument that the u is becoming a transnational corp. (~the
university in ruins~), which i still think is the single best
depiction of what's wrong with higher learning in the u.s. today..

but if the folks on this list who are academics started to describe
the nature of their workloads, i think you'd find that said workplace
is far from homogeneous... it's not a place where struggle is absent
or muted, though its assorted mystifications suggest as much... yes,
it's a place that often drives me nuts, to be true... part of what
complicates the disparity of the learning institution is the
disparity of the workforce itself---if you hail e.g. from the lower
economic classes, you're bound to find yourself among the higher
economic classes (and the "better" the institution, the higher the
classes)... which means one's concern for wage may not be shared by
one's colleagues... it's not factory work, no, and one of the chief
distinguishing features is that those who work on the factory floor
generally do so b/c they need to earn a living, and this is what the
world has offered them (at least, most of the factory workers i've
known, and i've known plenty, have migrated to same w/o it being,
uhm, their lifelong aspiration as such)... but i've met many, many
academics who work as academics on the basis of their interest in
same, the sense of power they get from same, the good they feel they
do by same, etc... which means, as i've posted here before, some of
my colleagues live in virtual palaces, whatever their motivations
might be... not so for so many other professions...

i'm on leave currently, and have been for a solid year (!)... hell,
i've *never* enjoyed such a thing, and my last place of employ would
certainly not provide for same, anymore than would my engineering
career---and yes, i've gotten more writing done as a result than you
can shake a stick at... but my "leave" has nonetheless been marred by
any number of institutional duties that just won't go away---a job
search, admission of new grad students, and so forth... your typical
white-collar, knowledge-worker problem (similar to when i was an
engineer---i'd take off for a few days and my phone would ring, and
ring)... the difference is that i've actually been paid for the past
year NOT to teach---at *this* institution... the same institution
that refused, twice, to fund travel to europe (italy), b/c the
project i'd proposed (which incidentally, and to be candid, i'd
already pretty much completed) was presumably of interest "only to
me," as a "creative" project... the same institution where my wife
and partner works adjunct, and has to scramble every semester for
courses (as we can't live at this relative level of comfort w/o her
teaching at least a 3/3---my course load for years, btw---and
preferably a 4/3 anyway)... you know the drill...

so, for one, there are the disparities of higher ed... e.g., (and i
will forsake any attempt at modesty here!) charles bernstein's
position at suny/buffalo, as an endowed chair, is much different than
mine here at boulder, which is much different than anselm hollo's at
naropa... charles gets paid the most, has more responsibility (and
experience as a writer) than do i, but has less experience than
anselm, who teaches in a much, much different kind of institution, at
lower pay, than the large state u's where charles and i hang our hats
(charles and anselm, you guys can chip in anytime you like!)... can
you really make sense of this? (let alone justice)... well, we all
teach, yes... i daresay we all teach quite differently too---in fact,
i daresay i would be the most opinionated of the three of us re HOW
we should all be teaching...

in point of fact, though, many who work in higher ed never see the
promised land of a 2/2, and i'm here to report (sorry) that it's not
quite the promised land i thought it was, esp. at this point in my
life... and if i can be fooled in this regard, i would like to think
anyone can... and for two, there are the disparities OF the higher ed
workforce, which for me are largely about class issues... i've never
experienced anything quite like the latter, honestly, and i'm
continually turned off when i meet 35-40 year olds whose lives are,
well, SET---tenure, house, etc.... maybe i'm a jealous guy...

so:  in point of fact, academia's indifference to poetry (by and
large) is part of a much deeper symptom that turns (you called it) on
the socializing practices of this institution... by the time one
becomes a fortune 500 engineer one is likely fully socialized (if
alienated)... ditto for investment counselor... while a focus on
teaching can keep an academic professional from becoming too awful
alienated, the kind of uprooting that's generally expected (as a
result of job market pressures), along with encoded aspirations
customary to most graduate programs, militate against the academic
professional's grasp of the demands of and the value of creative work
in general... the discourse, or sphere of possible articulation, is
so heavily circumscribed from the outset that something as
potentially unruly as poetry (not to put too fine a point on it) is
simply not to be trusted, except during graduation ceremonies and the
like (when you will hear most administrators trumpet the writers on
their faculty, and quote from appropriately sacred poetic texts)...
similar, again, to engineering, though here the discourse is
overdetermined by on-the-job realities (and there is all manner of
concern in the engineering communities, and has been for years, as to
whether the curriculum is properly dovetailing with the workaday
profession)...

it's this discursive effect, as i see it, that poets most react to
negatively... e.g. the "language" of theory, the manifestation of
thought as susceptible primarily to the often agonizing logic of
footnotes, and so forth... naturally we (as poets, or writers, yes)
pride ourselves on constructing our texts and proffering our ideas
w/o regard for such constrictive regulatory practices (though here
again, i mself prefer to see what happens when discourses collide,
and i include in this the discourses of technology, as i've come to
know them)... but you know and i know that we're fooling ourselves,
in all likelihood, if we think we operate ipso facto W/O any
incursion from this latter realm, as we too have been socialized (AS
poets, AS writers)...

which brings me back to my question, which you were nice enough to
thumbnail for me... i.e., how these other workplaces come to shape
our poetic practice, which could be (yes) a matter of the socializing
forces at work in our work...

in any case, i want to go on record here as saying that i'm still
crazy after all these years... while i understand entirely that my
concerns as a writer have inevitably been shaped by my concerns as an
academic (and as an engineer, i must say)---which goes to your
concern, mark, as to the monopoly of academe (b/c surely the broad
contours of academe can't be dismissed on the basis of individuated
differences)---i don't see this as a significant problem precisely
b/c i don't see academe as exerting this control on me willy-nilly...
i worked my ass off to become an academic, yes, only to find, as per,
that it wasn't quite what i thought it would be... and if someday i
should leave the teaching profession, no doubt my work will alter as
a result... but hell, (to presume a bit) it could prove a helluvalot
LESS interesting, no?... one thing i do know:  i wasn't about to
write poetry while under the daily umbrella of fortune 500... those
of you who've managed that, you're better men and women than i...

best,

joe

Andrew---

Sympathetic to aspects of what's called "lyric,"
but also skeptical of how that term is often used,
I am curious about your points here--

I am especially curious about the ways you seem to
want to combine a generational distinction (new vs. old)
with the "lyric" vs. "prose-like poetry" distinction....

And it raises some questions for me
in part because I don't really know your own poetry
(where can I find it?) or for that matter your age
(I assume we're roughly of the same generation?)...
and in part because I don't see how what you'd call
a Pinsky-Perelman mode dominates a Howe/Bidart mode
(questions. Would you include Palmer, or Yau,
or Shapiro, or Armantrout, or Jorie Graham,
or Lauterbach, or Guest, to name but a few,
more in the Howe mode? I don't want to be
putting words in your mouth....)

I see them both as established modes which exist,
both of which young (or beginning, of whatever
biological age) writers are often encouraged---
depending on the particular social context(s) in
which they come to *contemporary poetry*
(as oppossed to say "poetry itself")--to imitate,
or accomodate. I don't see such an aesthetic
(by which I don't necessarily mean to say
"merely aesthetic") distinction as particularly
a matter of the old and the new, except in the
context of certain circles.

So, when I look at young or "new" writers I see,
whether or not one prefers the "S. Howe" mode
(as you do), or what you'd call the Perelman mode,
and see a range of writings (and also feel there's a lot
of writing that doesn't get enough attention because
it doesn't seem to be fashionable enough, for whatever reasons)
for me it's not so much a question of "new" vs. "old"
but a question of the range of various options that
are called poetry today, and even at times a debate
over what is called poetry itself...

I'm curious if you'd see the distinction you're making
between "prose" and "lyric intensity" in earlier generations
as well. For instance, say Ashbery vs. O'Hara or Duncan?
Or earlier, Stevens vs. Williams?
I'm asking this (though I know you want to talk more
about young and/or new poets more) because
I'm trying to figure out how this vexed term "lyric"
operates today....

It seems there are several overlapping
(but also potentially contradictory) defintitions of the lyric
in contemporary poetry...

1 defintion claims that a work is LYRIC to the extent it is
"I" based (regardless of whether that writer's work looks
or reads more like "prose" or whether it is more condensed or
fragmented in style), whether that it's an "I" the poem
claims to "express" (or "confess") or an "I" the poem is
interested in creating, or claiming is a construct

2 definition of lyric claims that a work is LYRIC to the
extent that it isn't discursive, that it doesn't look or read like prose
(regardless of whether its condensations of fragmentations
are primarily perceptual, cultural, or "I" based in terms of
content)...

These definitions seem to exist for both proponents and detractors
of what's called the lyric

There's probably other ways to summarize what the lyric does, or is,
but I'm quite curious about how these two ways of looking at the
lyric tend to circulate. I still maintain, that if anything's changed
in contemporary American poetry in the last ten years, it's the
shift in emphasis not so much in what's being written as in which
way of defining lyric is more common (a working hypothesis--
though, it could be said that this may have some effect on
what's written, alas)....

Not to come off a "language apologist" (for as you may know,
I've a lot of quarrels with them too),
I personally find a lot more pathos and even self-dramatization
and what I (if not you) would call "lyric intensity"
in Perelman at his best (I'll say his three books of the late 80s for now)
that Howe, even though it looks less "lyric" (by defintion #2)
even though I also highly value work, as you claim that
has a more direct and less fabricated relation to its author
(though I do think Susan Howe is a rather odd example of that!
Better, say, the younger (and underpublished) writer Yuri Hospodar
(since you wanted to talk about the new and young) for instance....
Or Brett Ralph or Nancy Johnson (neither of whom are
particularly interested in Perelman or Ashbery or Stevens--
Brett's in town for a Robinson Jeffers conference; Nancy's
huge on Baraka currently--but both of whom, like Ashbery,
I too would call EXTREMISTS in the best sense of that word....

Subject: The Pressing Question of Fun


(hope this isn't out-of-date when it finally gets posted. (make me happy,
tim.))

I haven't spent much more than a few seconds on the fakelangpo site, except
to make that duck explode (again and again!). You gotta wonder what it is
about it that's getting under the real language poets' skin, since as
Barrett
pointed out, it doesn't pose that much of a threat (i.e. intellectual or
institutional rival to the current avant-garde), and, as Nick stated, it's
actually kind of boring and maybe not that fun at all. But this question of
fun will not go back into the genie bottle. It's Millie's insistence that
fakelangpo is the kind of linguistically experimental work that is funner
than the original langpo that has to be annoying as hell. It harkens back to
Steve Evans' essay on Rebecca Wolff's Fence Manifesto ('97) and her apparent
reduction of all poetical values into one word: fun. The kids, it seems,
want
to have fun, and the adults, it seems, want to have.... reputations maybe?
intellectual companionship? a page in literary history with their name on
it?
ideology critique? job security? the high road of art? respect?

It can't help but be annoying because some language poetry actually was fun.
Stephen Rodefer's _Four Lectures_ is very fun, edgy, smart, funny and nasty,
too. Bob Perelman's work is kind of fun if not funny. Some Alan Davies is
fun
as I recall. Some will say Charles Bernstein's work is fun, entertaining.
And
everyone loves Ron Silliman's puns. Barrett's work, however, is not fun at
all. And if it were fun or tried to be so, it would ruin it (see CNN joke at
bottom of "fake response" post). In fact, it's not even not fun. It's not
anti-fun or against fun. It's a-fun, which is a higher form of fun if you
think about it.

What's my point? My point is that what a lot of language poetry, the kind
Millie is probably reacting to (in addition to its tedious pedagogy, mostly
likely that, yes), lacks as well as fakelangpo (or any poetry based on fun
as
sole goal, except for FLARF!, which is in a class of its own) is DEEP FUN.
Something more fun than fun. The total package.

For instance, if Millie and I were to have sex, as she said she wanted to,
we
could go out and have fun. Ride a rollercoaster, eat ice cream, roll over
dumpters. We could tease and joke, like they do on that stupid MTV
'Dismissed' show, engage in flirtatious banter ("I''m so hungry, I could eat
you," etc). I could drop an ice cube down her blouse (surprises are always a
turn-on) and she could make me an Easter basket with an Easter egg that had
the words 'Big Ben' painted on it (for no reason). This would all be fun
foreplay but it's nothing compared to the deep fun to come. The deep fun I
can't speak of here because I don't want to ruin it for you, Millie.

Or anyone else who wants to join us.

Joe: Having experienced other work environments can be an innoculation of
sorts. This was at one time the norm--I'm thinking of all my
depression-raised profs who went through four years of WWII before
schooling under the GI Bill. My concern is more about the large and I think
increasing numbers of poets or aspiring poets who have never left the
classroom--from kindergarten to MFA or doctorate to teaching, with summers
off for good behavior. And I'm very aware that few of them are working
class. Whatever marketplace requires diversity to flourish.

At Columbia they have an antinepotism rule--I don't know if it exists
elsewhere--on the road from grad student to tenure you have to teach
somewhere else for at least two years. Something like a recognition of the
problem, which of course afflicts fields other than writing.  It's a
different kind of problem in fields that would be difficult to pursue
without the institution, tho--hard to imagine that a lot of serious
research could be done without its facilities and facilitation.

I taught psych for a year at SUNY Old Westbury . Back then, and maybe
still, it saw its special mission as serving kids from the various kinds of
ghettos--not a lot of rich kids, and a lot of kjids who worked very hard
for their educations. At the end of each year the department faculty would
meet informally with the graduating majors. One very wealthy clinical prof
in his late thirties told the assembled mostly black and hispanic kids,
with a few women in their forties who were trying to make new lives for
themselves thrown in, what his advisor had told him when he was a senior:
"You should really take some time at something else before grad
school--your world is a bit limited." So the prof proceeded to tell the
assembled about his delightful year going from resort to resort in Latin
America before starting grad school. They were a polite bunch, but a lot of
jaws dropped.

I have this idiotic utopian idea of a universal mandatory one year draft
for 18 year olds, during which kids would be forced to interact away from
their usual environments with kids raised very differently. Literacy could
be taught under military discipline for those who needed it, but the main
purpose would be socialization to something larger than what one was born
into  (like class or race) or would subsequently be trained into (I like
the French word for training--"formation"). A year of various kinds of service.

There are a lot of obvious problems with this fantasy. For one, it assumes
goodwill on the part of whoever would administer it.

When I've floated this the objection from folks in grad school has been
universally "oh my god, another year before I can finish?"

Enjoy your time off--strenuous enjoyment, for sure.

somewhere in this legthy post, my name appears, alongside some
contradictions its bearer recently committed. I only do it to amuse.
     The imaginary LCD intended by "the poetry of this moment" consists of
far too many perpetrators/impressions to permit me to name them all, these
malefactors in the House of Light. I tell you what. Here's what I'll do.
Invidiously, I'll distinguish certain exceptions.
                      The sumptious spell-weaving ,heart-wrenching, mindful
books of Lissa Wolsak. The dangerous politesse and luminous Virgilisms of
Lisa Robertson. And for a third Vancouver woman, the challenging collisions
of Deanna Ferguson (too challenging for my interpretation, but I keep on
trying.) In fact, the entire constellation of those poets around the
Kootenay School.     No doubt some are mere shoppers. You tell -me- which.

   To the extent that these three can be termed "Language riters," they
prove it by not sounding the least bit like one another. Nor much like my
hasty characterizations, either.

   Thinking of these three Graces  has calmed me. aye, I was p.o.d when I
laid waste to a generation's documented miseries with my sandy shovel and
dented bucket. But at least I know who did it--no rumors that I was
hypnotized to crash my kiddie-car into the Shrubbery of Sebastopol's
financial district (the Bank of America building).
                        Here in Calif, which I know best (i.e., sketchily at
best} a dozen and more exceptions to my cavalier dismissals........
Stroffolino,still in the under-40 ranks, and Trane DeVore, and DA  Powell
(tho' he chalks blackboards for Harvard these days), and Jocelyn
Sridenberg....& & & & & &.....but this is already too long. Shipmstes,
accept my bipolar condition, please, it's in fashion, complcated as it is by
paranoid schizophrenia. (Thru mental illness, I learned to spell)  .And my
lies.
      Like the woman  shown being busted last night on "COPS", "I'm on at
least 4 different meds --  I shouldnt have to go to jail!" All she cd carry
was 4 cartons of ciggies. Likewise, had I more strength, more memory, snd
more time, --esp. w/  y o u, sweetie--we cd come to an understanding.
Meanwhile, I'll say, poetwise, "Your law sucks!"
I recall enough of grad school to say that this is written by a different
set of rules. Love being first among them. Tough-enough love.  David.

Subject: Questions and Comments for Nick and David B.


To Nick, who writes:

"To my surprise, my acquaintance Tom Orange, whose own work has on occasion
given my personal avant-garde poetics chops quite a hefty boost, was
apparently bored by EM's feminist version of an avant-garde that is not
afraid to be mutually supportive, gentle, amicable even to the point of
relating to other poets in an open and mutually supportive way about
feelings
such as those of loss (mentioned by more than one person on the panel.)"

How can you say you side with the "poetics of amicability" given your
callous
response to Millie Niss? It may not be criminal but your responses have
definitely not been 'gentle' or 'supportive' except in a superficial way.

"If the truth be known, I've never been the type to turn away aghast at an
exciting bit of literary gossip or debate. But this crowd was definitely not
in the mood to rise to Douglas Rothschild's inflammatory prodding's."...

Will someone email Douglas and tell him to get on the list to defend
himself,
or rather explain to us his motivations for doing what he did?

"I guess I was one of the audience members most guilty of expressing certain
pacifist leanings towards certain apparently quite boring urges to discuss
things in a gentle, perhaps even quietly rational and mutually supportive
manner. Do poets have to be constantly feisty or insulting and sarcastic
towards one another to be considered brilliant, witty and amusing?"

See above. You are not discussing things in the manner you claim to want to
discuss them. You are not being quietly rational. You are being as defensive
and prodding as the next guy. There's a poetry war going on and you're part
of it, Nick.

"Let's face it-  men- and women-all too often resort to shooting things,
points and people down to in order to deal with feelings of any kind- loss
or
whatever-or just to get lots of attention. Then off to the gym or the poetry
wars committee meeting."

Yes, we should face it and learn accept the psychological reality that this
is sometimes necessary. Aren't you a psychologist?

"This brings me to a related old gripe that I might as well mention, since I
'm on the topic of the poetics of aggression. I once asked Rochelle Ratner
why she supported the publishing of some vicious attacks put forth by
Richard
Kostelanetz in the American Book Review (not to be confused with the
American
Poetry Review) including calling Charles Bernstein a fascist and that his
book -My Way- should be compared to Hitler's -Mein Kampf-. By a strange
coincidence I had warned Charles years before of the possibility that some
weird literary character might insult him by twisting this title. When I
asked Rochelle Ratner why the ABR persisted in publishing Kostelanetz'
ravings and further responses to them in the letters section, she said  -we
need controversy to bring interest to the magazine-. Clearly the poetics of
aggression won out over the poetics of amicability at the ABR on this
occasion."

Do you think you and your colleagues -- those you identify yourself with,
i.e. other language poets -- believe in and practice a poetics of
amicability? How was the 'clearing of the ground' that occured in the 70s
and
80s to happen without some aggression, some shaking things up, some
inflammatory activity? Do you really think your community is all that
inclusive?

"One of the most difficult things about being a poet has to do with the
issue
of legitimizing one's work. In almost every case, as poets become more
experienced they learn to make some efforts to earn and/or acquire some form
of literary response or acknowledgement. Since L-A poetry has earned a
degree
of 'name' of not 'face' recognition (there are over 750 references toit on
the Google search engine) it is no surprise that currently all kinds of
opportunities are available to find ways to exploit this to get attention.
Every since L-A poetry obtained some recognition there have many people
anxious to get attention for themselves by what came to be called
L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E bashing. But possibly the secret of the success of L-A
poetry
was that the activities of these poets had more to do with creating a space
for making various kinds of experimental, or otherwise unconventional,
poetry
available rather than legitimizing this or that specific poetry or style of
writing."

Probably, but it also had to do with creating a space for younger poets to
interact and create community outside of those institutions and communities
dominated by older, established poets. We need more spaces like that _now_.

"In this sense, the fake langpo website is an understandable outgrowth of
the
efforts of L-A poets to create more space for experimental poetry. My
difficulty had to do with the phrase 'fake' but what the hell. I never liked
the phrase 'language poetry' much either. I think most serious poets have
had
the experience of being confronted by others, frequently relatives or close
friends, who imply they are wasting their time, and that in some sense what
they are doing is -fake-. This is because only famous poets, and usually
only
famous poets who have been dead a long time, can be considered -real- poets.
So, in some sense, to most people all poets except for these very few poets
who have been legitimized or, as they say, canonized, have some aura of
being
fake. Most of the poets I know who have been focused on poetry every day of
their lives from 20 to 50 years appear to be quite sensitive, painfully
sensitive, to this issue of the legitimization of their activities (to be
somewhat distinguished from getting credit for the quality of their poetic
activities)."

That's part of the problem: seeking legitimization for the unconventional.
Once you get legitimacy, what you do is no longer as dangerous.

"The L-A poets I think were most successful in creating an atmosphere of
legitimizing the activity of writing unconventional poetry. You would have
to
be over 50 to remember how conservative the poetic establishment was before
the activities of L-A poetry somewhat changed the atmosphere. The pressure
to
write conventional poetry in order to get published was very powerful prior
to the 70's, particularly in the U.S."

It still is.

"It can be very difficult to spend a good deal of your life on something
that
large numbers of people feel is a meaningless waste of time. This isn't to
say that there are not large numbers of people who feel poetry is
important.There are. But of course, there are few who feel that the career
of
poet makes any sense at all."

It doesn't make any sense -- that's part of the beauty of it. It's up to you
to make it make sense.

"Once, one of my relatives said to me, when he couldn't find my telephone
number and had to check information- you can't even get your phone number
published-."

Well, that's when you gotta suck it up and tell them to stuff it. Funny
relative you got there.

"To this day, a good deal of what I experience about the public response to
poetry discourages me from wanting to continue the practice of writing
poetry
at all."

The passion's got to come from you, not the 'public'. What else are you in
it
for? "Well, I started to writing poetry so I could get chicks," some male
poet said a few years ago. What? When community fails me, when other people
fail me (including myself) at least I always got the poem to keep me

"Of late I have not felt that way at all about this list, although there
have
been times that I have.I don't want to do anything to discourage the
expansion of possibilities for experimental and unconventional poetry, or
any
poetry for that matter. So, fake langpo people, from my point of view, go on
and fake it all you like. Just keep writing it and getting it out there."

Doesn't sound very supportive to me, Nick. Maybe the language poets are
finally starting to reap what they've sown with the arrival of fakelangpo.


And to David Bromige, who writes:

Judging from the email I received, below, it seems that the virus is
circulating on UPenn acounts (such as my own). For months I have had an
updated Norton anti-virus program working that informs me of infected emails
and quarrantines them on my system. So, I'm not sure if it's me who has done
this! Let me know, back channel,  if there's anything I should do, however.

Dear dept.english users,

Many people have asked recently about the slew of strange messages
appearing in their dept.english email accounts: replies from people you
didn't email, messages with unexpected attachments, emails from friends
asking why you sent them a blank message, and so on.

This chaos is the result of the devious "Klez" virus making its way across
faculty and student computers at Penn. The amazing thing about this virus
is that it can "impersonate" people. That is, it can change the "to"
address in an email. So, an email that X receives that purports to be from
Y may actually come from a third party, Z. The virus can do this without
"hacking" into your account or even having any access at all to your
computer.

This means that even though you receive a strange message from somebody
you know, he or she did not necessarily send the message; it may have been
generated by an entirely innocent third party who does not know that his
or her computer is infected with the virus. Likewise, if someone tells you
that you have sent them a message you never sent, then maybe it didn't in
fact come from you, but from another computer.

So how do you know you are not infected?

The best way to ensure that you aren't infected is, first, always run
virus protection software, like Norton AntiVirus, which is available for
free to the Penn community (and already installed on all faculty
machines).

Second, make sure the virus software is up-to-date, by running the "Live
Update" feature (if you are on campus, the machines update automatically
without your having to do anything).

Third, do not open any unexpected attachments.

Finally, avoid using Outlook Express for email; the Klez virus spreads by
taking advantage of a programming bug in Outlook Express. Most other email
packages, especially programs like Pine or Mutt, keep you safe from
viruses.

Speaking of fun, I've invented a term called Funology.
It's a system of enjoyment that I use from time to time
example: Have a pump at the gym in the morning,have a big delicious
breakfast.go to a movie,go on a shopping spree,have sex,listen to music,go
to the Art Gallery .etc
all in one day, the trick is to stimulate your senses!

Millie,

In your April 19th post, in response to my post "Some Emotions," you wrote:

"I can't make sex in saint Louie (the concenpt is nice though),"

Obviously I read too much into it. Sorry if you're offended. I was trying to
make a comparison and distinction between certain kinds of fun, pleasure,
excitement, gratification with that joke about our virtual date.

The problem with using 'fun' as a fundamental poetical value is that it's
totally taste-driven. What you like someone else may not like, and that's
where the conversation stops. But I agree there is a certain puritanism and
asceticism in a lot of language poetry and theory that tend to drown out the
enjoyment, not to mention the literary politics that comes along with it,
which is no fun at all. And the academic discourse -- masquerading as both
"poetics" and "politics" -- it has installed into place.

Maybe a better term for fun would be 'immediacy.' However, that seems not
quite as fun as the monosyllabic 'fun'. Something antithetical to modernist
difficulty and discursive complexity (sorry, Chris S.).

"No burden in the recondite" -- Neruda. Fun needs a philosophy. Descartes had
doubt and we shall have fun.

I think I'd like your website more if I could register/log in to it. Does
anyone else have this problem? Most headings I click on bring me nowhere but
back to the homepage.

out of curiosity does the virus do any damage other than replicating itself.
on a Mac they just come in as blank documents & since I dont have an address

[WARNING: This whole message is *severely* off-topic ...]

Klez is known to forge the address the E-mail appears to come from.  It's
pretty clever about this.  It could be a list member in whose address book
Charles Bernstein et al appear who's infected without "the list" being
infected.  I was under the impression the listserv software feeding this
list will not pass on attachments. You need to receive an attachment to
be infected with Klez, I believe.

Virus protection is a large subject. When you get a message from Symantec
or McAffee or whoever that you should update your virus definitions, you
need to translate this into English.  The translation is: "Our product
hasn't been protecting you."  The whole concept of "fingerprint" based
defenses as exemplified by traditional anti-virus software is proving to
be uncreasingly unrelable.

For those that have the misfortune to run Microsoft, the best solution is to
combine anti-virus software with MIME filtering, and make sure the filter is
set to catch all Windows-executable extensions, of which there are an awful
lot.  I'm not sure what's good out there for MIME filtering for individual
PCs; the MIME filtering I've put in has been at the server.  Where I work the
MIME filter catches about 95% of the worms all by itself, including *new
ones* -- without needing to be updated.

 On my PC they also come in as blank documents as I have McAfee Viruis Scan
installed. This particular virus seems to be annoying mainly because it has
managed to get into millions of peoples address books, so the sheer quantity
of viral emails everyone gets is  a drag.

I don't remember how this thread started but I just
wanted to put my three cents in.

There's Susan Howe and there's "Susan Howe." "Susan
Howe" is this Positioned Entity that a lot of
mainstream (and non-mainstream) readers, academics,
organizations, and other poets use to ignore many
innovative and dynamic writers like Ann Lauterbach,
Fanny Howe, Joan Retallack, Rosmarie Waldrop, and, for
that matter, Susan Howe.

"Susan Howe" is also used by many non-mainstream (and
mainstream) writers, publishers, etc. to displace
younger women writers of wild and unfamiliar bearing
(Willis, Moxley, Ramsdell, etc.)

See I think the funniest part of it is that many
people (mainstream and non-mainstream) who love "Susan
Howe" have never actually *read* Susan Howe.

For me, I'm nuts about both "Susan Howe" and Susan
Howe. But I'm a little partial to Susan Howe.

yes, yes, the virus does damage. If you open the attachments it will use up=
 memory space in your computer so that it will not perform many tasks and=
 will also timeout more frequently-- one of the tasks it will not do incl=
udes  booting up your computer if the damage is too extensive.

involved in the teaching of writing, from high school through
college. For the purposes of an unrelated research project I would
like to survey poets and poetry readers who are presently engaged in
the teaching of writing. Note: it doesn't have to be composition. It
might involve teaching of literature or other subjects where
"writing" is the primary mode of the presentation of knowledge. I am
especially hoping to hear from adjuncts, grad students and others who
may have developed their own methodologies and evaluation models.
Please contact me backchannel if you would like to participate in a
survey I am developing. Thanks.

fyi: the current issue of Consumer Reports specifically covers the subject of
computer viruses with security software ratings and advice on what to do, and
what NOT to do.

nick, david hess, others:

i was certainly not bored by eileen myles' suggestion of a more amicable
approach to the discourse of poetry (tho i can see how my comments about
poetry wars and pacifism--a particularly sensitive term in our permanent
wartime economy--might have suggested that); in fact i find it
refreshing and potentially very promising, but not without reservations:
disagreements often remain unspoken between friends in less than
productive ways. by contrast, in a space like this where discussion
happens between friends, acquaintances and strangers alike, it seems
that a lot of unproductive rancor gets exchanged before we really get to
the hearts of issues; or else a lot of bandwidth gets taken up with what
strike me as talkings around rather than to issues. (i have in mind here
recent threads with subject headings like what is language poetry, poets
should not read academic criticism, etc.)

i'm more interested in an informed and productive discourse about poetry
than in cocktail party chatter or poetry wars, tho according to david
hess these latter are alive and well: "There's a poetry war going on and
you're part of it, Nick," and your and barrett's critiques/criticisms of
millie niss's fakelangpo endeavors are part of it. (personally i've been
more puzzled than anything else in determining how to read millie niss's
reading of language poetry.)

_telling it slant_ is apparently part of it as well: "there's a lot of
anger among certain younger (and older) poets. . . ," david writes
further, which is "constantly being erased from literary history (thus
resulting in more rage) as it's now being written, as in _Telling it
Slant_ and your post Barrett."

in the interest of a more amicable means of disagreement and airing of
differences: why so much anger and rage david? is it really a volume of
bile that's missing from literary history? i mean i've read the may '79
poetry flash and tom clark's "stalin as linguist" essay among others, so
i know the historical arguments. what surprises me is that such anger
persists today. can't, for example, "the prescriptiveness of language
poetry and its theoretical discourse" tend as much toward an active
engagement that attempts to ascertain the nature and context of those
prescriptions as toward, in your words, "the urge to say 'fuck it, it's
a waste of time'"?

sincerely,
tom orange

MIME-Version: 1.0

The presentation talk at COCH-COSH, Toronto, today. The text is below.


[During the presentation I became increasingly ill. I developed, it turns
out, a fever around 102, vomiting, a migraine, chills, and half a dozen
other symptom. I returned back to my sister's house immediately.]

[What was shown: mime.mov, mum.mov, seals.mov, a couple of the asteroids,
everglades.mov, path2.mov.]


i'm trying to deal with silence, problematic language, "messy" language -
for example - what constitutes a word in mime? i'm not quite sure...

this is going to be a mess -

thinking about mime - what constitutes a word? for one thing these are
continuous actions of the body, hehe, whatever =-
tghe juxtaposition of b odies and a text you REALLY have to follow does
create a split or a mess here -
Not sure - I was thinking recently about protocols -
writing into them - what happens, I mean - think of PROTOCOLS as code -
suites of codes - protrocol suites =- then what do you have?

so that there's no break - it's like CXhristian Metz was writing sabout
film back there =- then - that the languaghe of film is problemaytic -
where's the breakdown into language, code, word, phonem,e, blahblah - the
blahblah from Heiner Muller - who doesn't worr y about thes things. so
anyway
well, this is an early attempt below - it sounds good - if I used the
words "representation" and the "subject" it would pass for academic - but
it seemed to be an error -
codework - for me - implies a tension between what might pass for surface
content, and what might pass for:
a. the substructural matrix (presentation format)
b. the sustaining protocols (email, ascii code, etc.)
c. the generating protocols (programming)
d. interacting protocols (html, programming)
- all of these are of course PROBLEMATIC in relation
to one another (good word here) - please continue reading up above on the
upper right - Azure (left) was just smokinjg a cigarette - anyway -


or: this is more like it - thinking of 'tending' or even 'ending' -
unintended codes - DNA running within the real - yes, well the natural is
problematic of course and also tended, but DNA has done well without our
interference for at least a billion or so years if you include RNA
sequences
tended codes - TCP/IP with the sysadmin - now this needs IMMEDIATEW
attention - tending a code or protocol suite which runs on its own - a lot
of codework
such as mine - does interfere with things on this level, then there are
the older coddes - Umberto Eco writing on
intended codes 1. - MORSE code for example - in its relation to spoken
language
god, the film's already half over and I still haven't started the stuff
from the Everglades - ok, hold on -
these are from
we got started, thinking of the MESS or entanglement in the Everglades
ecosystems - we kept going out there and getting bit by mosquitos and
deer-flies - as a sideline I want to have some deerflies in our apartment
as pets - anyway -
intended codes 2. - "messy" TAXONOMIES -
  the PHENOMENOLOGY OF APPROACH:
  to the EVERGLADES or the THICKET -
 the MESSY: Sexuality, Natural Language, Body
the messiness of the glades ecosystem is only a masquerade of course -
just likie thye messiness of everyday life - it self/organizes just like
anything else (if you've seen Wolfram's recent book A New Kind of Science
this relates -
so we're doing what's called a slough slog at the moment - chomping
through the water and pierphyoton - but on

you can see the bumpiness of the path on the right - down towards
christian point - against the drive to the university in miami, drunkard's
walk literally against the vectoring of zoning and develolpment in western
miami - there's a LOT to be said
{against that -
so -
there are these protocols - and the last, the morse, but also the
intended, beyond the morse - readingthe landscape, the the the - reading
the landscape, the taxonomies one finds/creates, etc. -
there are issues about leakage, sexuality and the body, all these terms
also from feminin ecriture, Irigaray, I hate to keep quoting people here
or thinking about these other manifestations occupying my mind - but
anyway - from Michel Serres' notion of the Parasite and extending this
into hacking and internet works -

the parasite interferes with everything; interferes with and constructs
the codes - so I'm interested in BROKEN codes, transformed codes, codes
which resist me, through which I'm tryig to say something - on the upper
write, writing on the body, on the upper write, erasing the body
one/against/another - leaving an uncomfortable trace - no matter
no matter what
therre's no MATTER in protocols - Leinin had a problem with that, well
diamat did anyway, developed something called the reflection theory in the
old USSR to take care of issues dealing with what wee're now calling the
VIRTUAL -
but that's far away - so with the b roken codes, and the mess, and
everything in=-between - trying to find away AROUND hypertest and the
clean linearity of most html pages, URLs, etc.
because the world branches and isn't cartesian in THAT WAY but just try
and make for example a full webpage do a five degreee tilt on your browser
like you hang a painting sfrom a nail and it slips just like that
it's almost impossible to make a SLIP of that sort in URL/hypertext
blahblahblah
of course you do the same thing one way or another with flash, but then
that's flash, preprogrammed

I mean the slip, SLIP, the fake, the parasitic, the unforeseen (NOT
programmed randomness, which I personjally have little interest in, I mean
we all devcelop - develop - these tiny little worlds...

so I'll leave the sound run, here's an asteroid, mappying the body messily
into space, we'll see -

tghat's it - that's the body - we're traveling around it, through it,
distorting it, it's a spaceship, it's virtual, or was -0 now it's a
dead-end file - that's all there is too it =-

now on the left we're erasing each other, erasing the marks/demarcataions

oh I DID forget to mention the sound is triggering the cameras - not that
that matters to anyone - there are five cameras, and the sound shifts them
directly - one against another, one in relation to another, now here are
some texts I think - the kind of thing I'm interested in against the grain
of legibility or protocol - Marjory might as well be Marjory Perloff but I
think it's really in relation to my sister who sometimes, but not always,
frighttens me; I have a feelig she types faster and more accurately -

sorry - tat thing was too poetic for my own good - yours tgoo - here's a
modem log having a bit of trouble connecting - you can see the TENDED
protocols not getting anywhere and then there's the writing on top of it -
all of it - moving through these =

they're two mathematical formulations - on the right, a code-structure
developed and then applied in the program - on the left, the function
formed out of a duplication of human nipples subtended by tangent vectors
and combinations...

so there's no conclusion to any of this - that much is obvious. i'm in hte
midst of writing abou tht ephenomenology of approach (which comes into
play when ytou come towards anything or vice versa) as well as thinking
through codes and protocols in relation to the body/flesh and messiness,
Kristevan abjection for example, without elimination - or precisely WITH
elimination, one might say, a pile of shit -

codework:: f({x}) -> {y} - any mapping is sufficient - TRACE of the
road-vector against the MESS or TANGLE across the glades path.  it
is the arrow - not the terms - that fascinates me - the arrow which
INSISTS on a mapping, linguistic or perceptual. one APPROACHES code
with code; the retina always already encodes, and further coding
provides a bracketing or intersection of terms x^~x permitting
definition. but BETWEEN x and ~x (not-x), there is a chasm or
FISSURE; inscription transforms FISSURE into CLIFF. do you follow
me? I am winging this. in this REALM, everything is inchoate, fuzzy;
one is immersed in the DIALOGIC of FLOWS among schema, scripts,
goals, regimes, mappings, sememes, and configurations. these moments
are THROUGH the path or road, not DOWN. HERE, I have no shadow. THAT
DAY, I was covered in sand-midge, mosquito, and deer-fly bites; I
carried a fever everywhere. but that day I drove the seven miles
brilliantly, reaching my destination in record time. ... ... ... ...
consider a CODE as a MESH with PARASITIC INTENTION. the PARASITE is
the nexus; in the absence of the parasite, all that's left is the
problematic of a 'natural' protocol. it is the PARASITE that
inhabits the sememe; it is the PARASITE that INSCRIBES. think of the
TEE formation: f({x}) <> |P| <> {y}. I inhabit the parasitic; the
road and path penetrate me: I gasp the name of the code: ROAD-NAME
TRAIL-NAME: ***MILLER*** and ***CHRISTIAN POINT***.

Trawling through the archive
(as more a lurker than an active member of this list)
I picked up this thread on "nature poetry"
running about a month back

Re im/morality of Nature Poetry

& would just like to note that the current issue of
ECOPOETICS

addresses exactly the issues tossed about
vis-à-vis bulldozers, flowers & other species, in/digeneity,
and possibilities for urban-oriented, historically and socially aware
nature writing

For example, the "centerfold" is a seven-page essay
by Robert Grenier, that begins
"Nature poetry is BORING"

But there's also Brenda Coultas on the Bowery
as fin-de-siècle Walden

Kenneth Goldsmith on the virtues of "paving the Earth"

Mike Kelleher's sheep-shagging "Pastoral"

Nick Lawrence's review of Lisa Robertson's The Weather

A long interview with Cecilia Vicuña
on seeds, art and politics in Chile, and talking to animals
with new work by Cecilia . . .

Kevin Killian's Hawaii piece, "Kona Spray Ad Campaign"

Robert Kocik's "Annotated List of Missing Social Services and Omitted
Agencies" (a substantial excerpt from Overcoming Fitness)

-- if you want to take on the "immorality" of mainstream nature writing,
Kocik is WAY ahead of the curve.

And MUCH, much more . . . check it out.

People are terrified of having fun: they think that "life's purpose" is to
make some marvellous breakthrough, earn millions, have great sex with a
super sexy superstar, win the nobel  prize, solve marvelously intricate
equations,write the "great" novel: but all of life is that, having fun,
being alive, enjoying, being as happy as one can moment to moment. If you
are not happy then what is the point of your wonderful poetic exexperiment:
now if a poet, a language poet doesnt really love the actuality of writing,
the actual feel of his pen on paper, the look of the words, their meaning:
well me old mate  THAT's a worry: there is no reason we should be dismayed
by "fun"  ..there is a sense that things are "trivialised" the artist poet
can have as much "serious fun" (hence delving into the intricacies of
literature or solving a complex equation or painting or whatever: all these
things can be fun, enjoyable: some people find all  life fun (except of
course pain and tragedy: I'm not talking inextremis and all those stuupid
extreme negative examples)  .. but in the sense that one can be alive to
evrything then a huge range of activities and arts and so on become fun,
enjoyable: the touble is in the definition....it has connotations of trivia:
but recall the way that O'Hara and others brought popular art - fun eg the
influence of seeing the comics like Daffy Duck combined for John Ashbery
wioth a vision or dream ( he'd been reading Milton) whence Daffy Duck became
the devil: now dark or strange as these things are: they are still fun:
possibly its more "serious fun" but fun all the same or god help: its the
way and extent to which one works one's mind.   I remember reading a book
years a go in which a writer with "writer's block" was asked by a
psychologist how much he enjoyed the actual act of writing (every aspect)
and this writer was amazed! He hadnt thoght that writing could be 9at least
as a starting point) pure fun! Unlike a carpenter who generally is "right
into" his chisells, his wood, evrything he does to build that boat or
house...poets and artists are tradesman: sure we go into some "deep stuff"
(and so we should) (and sometimes we deal in tragedy and pain but we cant
stay in there) Barring tragedy: and tragedy can be "incorporated" into one's
writings or art (generally at a "remove") then fun is  a good thing to have:
just that some people dont like dancing: they maybe like adding up
numbers...as long as we a re happy and arent amaking others unhappy. A
person who cannot have fun or laugh in life generally hsa a low self love:
and has difficulty loving others. Richard

This is a valid criticims of much of American poetry, but not of Lowell.
Read "The Quaker Graveyard in antucktet" or "Adam and Eve" or even a poem
like "Penelope" which is much more than whining.  Actually, Lowell dopesn't
whine at all in his poems.  He is much more likely to swagger unreasonably
and laugh at himself and others to excess.  And most of his poems, if you
count them, are not about himself, or not exclusively...they have universal
langugage and application.  It is not Lowell's fault that they callked him a
Confessional and assiciated him with two of his own students, Sylvia PLath
and Anne Sexton, the latter of whom who really did nothing but whine --
literally at her readings.  Her suffering was real; she suffered from mental
illness simiral to Lowell's own, but she exploted her suffering and people
would go to reasdings to see Anne Sexton cry.  This is pretty pathetic, but
it isn't what Lowell did, nor did it fit his personality (as far as we can
tell) or work, which just isn't sad or pathetic.

I think it is just the taste of the moment thqat made "Life Studies," the
one really easy overtly autobiographical book such a big success that it
drowned out his past and future works, and I think that was because that
book was the EASIEST thing he ever wrote, not the best.  Lowell did not hide
behind an academic career in order to get the right to just write personal
poems, he mostly wrote fairly "literary," difficult poems and got famous on
them but the hoi polloi were just waiuting for a bok they could understand.

Plus, Lowell did not graduate from Harvard.  He transferred to Kenyon
College.  He wasn't a great student, except in English literature, and had
no interest in graduating from Harvard to retain family tradition.

They say ouch.

In previous versions, there's a fallen Catholic, a rabbi, and a vegetarian--

They also walk into a bar.

Ouch.  Oy vey.  Nader.

If a given poet can really put herself to it and write something that
connects
with readers concerning pain, well, those are the poems I'm waiting
for/starving
for.  What bugs me about the American-confessional movement was just how
contrived it was-- worry about yr worldview and morals, write poems about
your
car and your house and your wife/husband.  Granted, this was the
1950's/1960's,
but other American poets were doing much more interesting things beyond the
fringes of a burgeoning therapeautic-esthetic.  Robert Lowell wrote some
good
poems, but he made a career out of his upper-middle-class "suffering," and
it
became pathetic.  Literally, he had nothing left.  Was and remains pathetic
(pathetique?/ I went to public school.)

I think poetry does a better job among genres regarding the exploration of
the
personal, interior, quiet conflicts that we all have to deal with-- I also
think
American poetry is absolutely fucking paralyzed by a notion that _this_ is
all
there is left to discuss/examine.  It's given an excuse for so-called
academically affiliated poets to write books about nothing but themselves,
their
divorces, their kid's diapers, and then point a finger at poets who aren't
somehow "authentic" enough, because they didn't go to Harvard and have those
damn qualms-- the ones that make you drink yrself to death or jump in front
of a
truck or jump off a bridge or turn on the gas-- yes, these are sad things,
but
ultimately, American poetry right now suffers from a legacy of miserable,
naive
analolgy-- a given poem should connect with an assumed emotional geographic
position of "the suffering person," or even worse, the ironically recognized
"suffering poet"--

When there are ten- to 1,000 millions of other events occuring-- and they
have
everything and nothing to do with the first-person event of recognition and
meditation--

I Reply:

I dunno, I'd rather talk about Oppen, to tell you the truth. But there
are people talking about "the generation now" out there. (And it IS a
conversation worth having.) Stephen Burt is one, calling a section of
them them "Elliptical Poets". And Susan Wheeler seems to be the
poet most firmly in that style. (Her newish book _Source Codes_ is
QUITE a wild ride of related [and unresloved] modes and strategies of
getting at/to "upper level music".)

And there are many others out there. And they should be talked about
(even though several of them are on this list--yikes), but I see no
reason why the Lang+Po people shouldn't be talked about as well.

After all, we're (they're) all contemporary . . . roughly.

Now, about Oppen . . .

Mime-Version: 1.0

the audio archive will be coming down this summer. i've decided that
the files are best left to the winds of the digital prarie and i'm
eager to use that bandwidth for another archival project, though
poetry audio will always be a part of the factory school site.

long ago promised copies of the 2-disk archive will be mailed
shortly, but those of you who are interested should read the
following.




--- begin forwarded text

Michael--

thanks for the note.

the Factory School "rm" files are very easy to obtain. I don't know
how comfortable you are with the whole biz, so I'll write it out in
full (as opposed to just listing the directories where the files are
stored).

Note that while the html files (thus the webpages) for the Factory
School site are located at www.factoryschool.org, the audio files are
stored at another location. This is primarily because the current FS
surver would never accomodate the 800 or so megs of data stored
there. The address for this material is www.one-thirty.org

but you'll never be able to access the files from that address
because there is no link to the files. In terms of audio storage,
however, the one-thirty.org site mirrors the FS site's directory
structure, with one exception:  there is an additional directory
called "sounds" which is within "content" and containing "poetry"

So, here is an example. On the website audio listing, rolling over
the link of the audio file listing for an Auden poem, one sees the
following:

http://www.factoryschool.org/content/poetry/auden/onthisisland.ram

When a viewer at the FS site clicks on the file listing as it appears
in their webbrowser, they link to what is actually a "pointer" file
-- this is a text file with the .ram suffix. If you open one of these
files, you'll see where the audio (.rm) file is stored. Sometimes it
is pointed to a non-publicly accessible directory. Opening up the
above .ram file (which on a mac, or at least my mac, is downloaded
temporarily on the desktop; on another computer it may be the
"download" directory or wherever), the file reads as follows:

rtsp://one-thirty.org/content/sounds/poetry/auden/onthisisland.rm

in some cases you can surf into the directories-- but you have to
know the name of the diretory-- so Auden , above would be like this:

http://one-thirty.org/content/sounds/poetry/auden/

but not in every case is directory listing allowed -- in some cases i
put in a redirect index page. if that happens, just write down the
name of the address of the file when you "roll over" it or
copy/cut/paste from the .ram file -- wherever it is stored on your
computer

if you are able to see the names of the files in the directories,
then it's easy:
"right click" (on a mac it involves holding the option key)  you
should commence downloading the file (I'm not sure but I think if you
don't hold down option or right-click it may actually try to play the
file or download it in the broswer). Anyhow-- I think the biggest
file is like 30 megs or so but most of them are a meg or two.

Let me know if you have any problems you spoke of, and please let me
know how I might get copies of the Greek poets. I'm interested in all
of the things you mentioned (Elytis and Seferis but, again,
especially the "minor" ones--but then I think of "minor" as a
postitive value, but your point is well-taken) -- I'm very curious to
hear them. Thanks!!

Millie, thanks for your post on Lowell. The notion that Lowell is a =
"whining" poet and that all his poetry is about "neurosis" is a bit of a =
cliche in avantgarde circles nowadays, a convenient excuse for not =
reading him or not thinking about him. "Upperclass" is another mantra =
out of the same sound bag.

You are right, he spent only about a year at Harvard (and was "hazed" or =
made fun of at the Harvard Advocate, so the story goes) -- there is =
hardly anything "Harvard" about him.

As Richard Tyler points out elsewhere the FakeLangpo effort and putting life
on the list in what was a sort of 'investigative poem' of manic
depressiontook guts.  interestingly enough this is the same quality whose
lack is lamented in the thread about poetry/prose.

directions]

I tend to see fhat in one dimension the whole tendency to put feelings into
boxes and so dismiss them as so much, 'lyricism', 'confessional', and what
have you is just a way of eliminating these gut feelings from poetry and
maybe from life.

Thisis somewhat ironic in light of recent medical and scientific recognition
or rediscovery of gut feelings (e.g, Lakoff).

Asin life and therapy ideally a true 'poetry', whatever name it goes by,
should work through holding and letting forth the gutsratherthan banishing
them forcing them out, 'letting it all hang out' is perhaps a return to the
sixties, but maybe the sixties before they were perverted by media
sensationalism.

Rachel,

The reference was not lost on me. That particular bit of wisdom pops into my
head almost every day.

Another great one, though I think of it less often, is "I never forget a
face, but in your case I'll do my best."

One other thing (in case you're interested) that pops into mind a great deal
is Steve Martin's mention of his book, _The Apple Pie Hubbub_ -- which he
says was a big success because it was the first book in which he used verbs,
adding, "My writing really brightened up after that."

Oh, there are other things too.

This seems to be in the same vain as when Edgar Lee masters called
Vachel Lindsay's performance poetry not poetry at all. Ill advised is
one word for Vachel, but it is poetry -- more interesting than the
graveyard smarm. Millie has something here. Why seek to constrain???

And Millie's e-poetry is very well conceived and executed -- nothing to
place on the side. I am thinking of the Flash square of words and voice
mouse-over on the fakelangpo site. And its self critical too.

Best, Geoffrey

Original Nancy Drew author dead at 96

May 29, 2002 Posted: 10:51 AM EDT (1451 GMT)


TOLEDO, Ohio (CNN) -- Millie Benson, the author who
captivated generations of young girls with her Nancy
Drew mystery books, died Tuesday night. She was 96.

Benson, a newspaper reporter for decades, was at The
Toledo Blade writing her weekly column when she became
ill and went home.

Late in the afternoon, she was taken by rescue squad
to Toledo Hospital, where she died about 8:20 p.m.,
hospital spokeswoman Colleen Grubb said.

Under the pen name Carolyn Keene, she wrote 23 of the
first 30 'Nancy Drew' novels in the 1930s, '40s and
'50s, launching a series that is still in print and
has sold more than 200 million books in 17 languages.

The character Nancy Drew was an adventurous, outspoken
and curious sleuth.

"At that time ... girls weren't like that. Girls were
dependent," Benson told CNN earlier this year. She
admitted she was very much like the character she
created.

"I didn't follow the pattern that normally girls
followed. I just was myself always, and what I wanted
to be or do or think, I did and nobody opposed me on
it," she said

When the Nancy Drew series was launched, Benson was
required to sign a contract, giving her a flat fee of
$125 per book, with no royalties. She also signed away
use of the name Carolyn Keene. Before writing each
book, she was given a brief outline of each story,
along with some of the main characters.

Benson was born and raised in Ladora, Iowa, and began
writing as a child. She graduated from high school in
three years, and received a master's degree in
journalism from the University of Iowa.

Late in life, she earned her pilot's license, and flew
alone in the United States and Central America. She
was still golfing in her 90s.

Benson worked at The Blade and the former Toledo Times
for 58 years. She continued to work despite failing
eyesight, hearing and an earlier bout with cancer.

Benson "reported to work every day, and retained a
zest for life and her profession long after most of
her contemporaries had passed on," said John Robinson
Block, publisher and editor-in-chief of The Blade.

"She was gutsy and daring, a living embodiment of her
Nancy Drew heroine. She influenced generations of
Blade reporters. I will never forget her," Block said.

OFF TOPIC.
I was getting four or five viral emails every day and it was Klez. The
sender and reply-to are forged by this virus so they tell you nothing.
I use netscape which limits the damage (I get emails from the virus but
I don't spread it because it doesn't get into the netscape address
book.) I have found norton anti-viral to be by far the best (sanitary)
protection. It notifies me of updates as often as every four hours. This
is highly recommended! Really, this problem will only get worse.
Also symantec (norton) has a website which will take an IP address and
give you the *real* sender of the viral email. Note IP addresses are
very difficult to forge. I was able to track the sender to a phone
company in Guyana, and i emailed the sysadmin of that company (symantec
gave me a name and street address as well), and the emails stopped. I
think they had infected PCs and didn't know it.

MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-transfer-encoding: 8BIT

1. I wonder if there is an intrepid lurker out there who might like to come
up with a few discourse-analysis-type features to look for and then
check-off in all posts, so that at the end of every two weeks or so a brief
statistical report could be issued for reflexive interest. Number of
affirmations (posts producing new ideas and relations), number of negations
(posts negating former posts), number of dialectical turns (negations into
affirmation), then one or two others (learning curve rate?) to characterize
the in-betweens.


2. So I guess no one else other than Chris S. and I have read S. Howe's
Pierce-Arrow.


3a. A recent temporal sequence of posts on this listserv -- Barrett’s notice
about an "Information Aesthetics" panel coming almost right after a post on
"poetry / poetics / prose" -- seems more than coincidental, yet, fittingly,
one cannot know for sure. "Information," and its technology, is exactly the
hidden concept that needs to be elaborated in the recent history and
transformation of prose and its concept -- social agency -- that prose once
unquestioningly embodied (perhaps even a history of the concept of agency
can now be written -- something Wlad Godzich has remarked has not yet been
attempted). Information technology -- not just the $800B industry in 2001,
but all its applications in the machinery of everyday life, the metaphor
itself -- lays a sort of gridwork for prose, and indexes a sort of
Haussmannization of prose, while inducing other ways of aesthetically
"unseating" that enlightenment bugbear, intentionality. (The Marxian analogy
for use of the Fibonnaci sequence in Tjanting has conveniently been lopped
off, or else has received only passing mention, for instance, while the
formal sequencing itself that the F. seq. allows, has been tied to other,
similar techniques.)

[b. At the "join" of book-as-object and the texts materialized in it, i.e.
the table of contents, I alternated the digital signs 1 and 0 as dingbats to
designate each section. The text of the book, then, is a sort of bubble of
intention, a restricted economy, within IT matrices of a general economy --
yes -- whose micro-differentials are intent (nb) on producing the "world"
(including what was once called the book's materiality, its design). A
general economy is supposed to "celebrate" loss and dissipation -- well, it
still does here, by analogy to the concept of social agency lost from
prose.... A fairly rustic attempt, but, nonetheless ... somewhat a rustic
who is printed "at an IT press, in an IT world...."]

c. One aspect of the listserv that I like is the way it simulates
intentionality -- as if one were in control.


4. At the recent juxtaposition of Perelman and Pinsky in a narrative
purportedly about poetry since the 1960s, my immediate reflex was to "think"
of what Coolidge and Fagan "did" to Angelou's presidential inauguration
poem, and of Bob Perelman's perceptive analysis of the ethical consequences
of their noun substitutions, substitutions which were needless to say
determined for Coolidge/Fagan by the dictionary. So what I did was
completely forget about the original post and, instead, I did a
Coolidge/Fagan Oulipoian number on Pinsky by "translating" a poem of his
into one of Perelman's -- assuming, hoping, that Bob's poem would disclose a
deeper ethics than were I to simply use, say, a dictionary as source-text. I
methodically translated Pinsky's "To Television" into Perelman's "Picture"
via a means that could well have been used, if it actually hasn't already
(judging by the results, I'm sure it has), by Mac Low.

The basis of Coolidge/Fagan's satire is not only Angelou's nouns of
"inclusiveness," but her syntax, which they therefore need to preserve
pretty much intact in their poem. Even as one grants that it is the syntax
that is satirized (and therefore "its rhetoric that works with established
cadences and symbols" -- BP), the noun substitutions, when isolated on their
own, nevertheless still remain offensive in their poem. When the nouns are
not isolated on their own, and considered as elements of syntax
(structurally performing the noun function), then does one's reading of what
Coolidge and Fagan have done change at all from Bob's? If one thinks of the
Haussmannization of prose by IT, it might at least give the situation of
vanguard vs. official verse a historical analogy to work with / against....
(Incidentally, Angelou's poem, read from the west wing of the White House,
was broadcast on TV -- so that's the other link between Pinksy and
Perelman.)

In the Mac Lowian rendition, Pinsky's decorative-cardboard syntax, in which
is nested the little "sweet bijous" of poeticized sentiment and reflection,
is not satirized, but dispensed with entirely, leaving all substitutive
words (not only nouns) to create for themselves new syntactic relations.
I've left off punctuating, though could have added it as well. Of course all
this is a tried-and-true technique of Mac Low's, so all I am really doing at
best is finding a way into understanding something more about how "chance"
works differently in Coolidge/Fagan's as compared to Mac Low's techniques.
But, nevertheless, the question of a deeper ethics may still remain!
(especially for thinking about Mac Low's procedures -- think, for instance,
of his book on The Cantos)

Chris,

You raise more issues than I can handle (not hard to do), so I'm just going
to zoom in on a few and wait for others to respond.

I emphasize generation partly because I feel there are differences, and
partly because I _want_ there to be differences.  This is a good moment to
be trying new things.

You mention "options."  I think there are strong conventions in play, but
that writers must resist them, not pick and choose (which, I know, is not
what you meant anyway).  "Experimental" writing (abhorrent term) has its
own forms of conformity.

At this point, all thinking about lyric must proceed from specific examples
of work by younger poets.

But wouldn't you agree that poetry -- as a whole -- has relinquished some
of its ambitions in trying to keep a toehold among intellectuals (esp.
academics)?

Call that something "lyric intensity" or "imaginative strangeness."

So I guess I would go with your #2: lyric = nondiscursive.  I don't think
the "I" is a very important issue, really, because avoiding it requires
almost as much artifice as using it, and I don't buy any of the ideological
arguments about "the subject" (whatever that is).  A central consciousness
is always implicit, and I like poetic voice.  Anonymity is a kind of pose,
too, and usually a lot duller.

I too think Perelman is an intense writer, especially when writing about
what it means to be a writer, here and now.  That seems to be his best
subject.  He is a help.  And Howe can be very maudlin.  But I think
ultimately her aspirations are higher than his.

Andy

Hi All,

I'll be a featured reader here in San Francisco, this Sunday, June 2,
at K'vetch, a monthly queer open mike, that I think's an interesting
scene.  The other feature will be hip hop poet Ralowe from Deep
Dickollective.  I've heard him and he does amazing things with sound
and different voices coming into the poetry.

Here's the details:

Sadie's Flying Elephant (a bar)
June 2, Sunday
  7:00 to 10:00 pm  (this really means 7:30)
corner of Potrero and Mariposa

Bring a poem and sign up for the open reading.

> And speaking of Steve Martin

Okay then-- another one I often think of is Martin's reassurance to those
not as educated as himself:

"Let's face it, some people have a way with words, while others...um...'not
have way,' I guess."


And one more:

"If you go to France, remember-- 'chapeau' means hat; 'oeuf' means egg--
it's like, those French have a different word for *everything*."


Steve Martin's humor, like that of Monty Python, really is based in
language. When it comes down to it, are there comedians of anything else? I
mean there are the Three Stooges and Dick Van Dyke tripping over his
ottoman, but otherwise it's all about language and timing. Eddie Murphy--
Woody Allen--

Is there a school of Language Comedians out there?  "Langco"?

Recently I've been studying the rather famous literary comedian Mark Twain,
and I read that he was so naturally funny that he once walked up to the
lectern and stood there looking out at the audience with a completely blank
expression for more than a minute, and people one by one began to chuckle
until the whole house fell into a cataclysm of laughter.

I was indeed in Buffalo for a couple hours a couple weeks ago, went
to a ball game at, good lord, Pilot Field with a new corporate name,
Dunn Paint or something. Went with Jack Cardoso, a wonderfully cranky

Andrew,

While I agree with you that there is a younger generation out there working
with different concerns than many of the poets that get tossed about in the
discussions on this list, I can't really hop on the "At this point, all
thinking about lyric must proceed from specific examples of work by younger
poets" bandwagon. The lyric has a long and lush history that will far
outlast our current discussion, dont you think?

yesterday i began with a public presentation, my hands danced on the keys,
the images got away from me, one/two/many, i'd forget, bring back another
language-particle, another phrase or phase, the letters were falling down
the screen, what did i mean, i'd forget, dealing with protocols and codes,
hardly producing odes, it was the thought of the collapse of thought at
thought's collapse, it was taking me down with it, later everything left
me, my body sprang at nourishment, everything leaving beserk from the

thinks of ONLY CLEAN THINGS, unknown territories of the body tube, i'm
centrifugal, everything exits, leaves the collapsed ship, sails
water-logged, every moment lost, i realized i am writing this with half a
mind going into withdrawal of all thought and loss of appetite -:the body
tube opens everywhere, i'm writing this beneath its sign, it's hardly
mine, it hands, drools, leaks for the mind, it drags the mind down, it's
norwalk virus, it's norwalk-like virus, i'm losing weight, five or six
pounds already, i'm hardly steady, i can't walk well, my body's hell, i'd
say, take my body away today and stay away, my mind resists shrieking,
that is it wants to hold on to the tethers in all weathers, i know when

Tom I was just having a lok at your and Nick Piombino's work (yours was in
my battered copy of "In the American Tree") and both are good: but what
about your name's sake Tom Veitch: very funny: god too: what happenned to
him? ....I came across his poems in a book about the NY School some time ago
(the "first one"  - if it can be called  a school - it included Ashbery,
Veitch, and some gay poet who when I come to think of it: I mean the
material was quite risque and I was shocked at the time:it was probably
partly satirical and maybe not as 'bad' as I thought then...)...but overall
I feel the greatest lit. is comic: but one of the writers I valorise,
Faulkner: his humour is maybe the apparent conplete lack of it, or maybe I
miss it: is "The Sound and the Fury" actually comic, or satiric? If so, I
miss the point in that case: (maybe there's a dark humour in "As I Lay
Dying")...but there are a lot of amusing things in language poetry without
it all being "hilarious": any movement or any  movers of movements  that
cant laugh a bit is (are) a worry. Richard.

I had similar intimations when I first read Standard Schaefer's -Nova-(Sun
and Moon,2001) in which a section of the book consists of numerous short
prose poems written as footnotes to the poetic text.

As for the relation of poetics to prose, some crucial works for me in this
regard are Bernadette Mayer's -Story-, -Moving- and -Studying Hunger-. These
prose poetry works set the stage, for me, for the impact of Silliman's -
Chinese Notebook-(in- The Age of Huts-, Roof,1986), which I had read much
earlier either in manuscript form or in magazines and Carla Harryman's
-Under the Bridge-(This,1980). Partly as a result of becoming so immersed in
these works, I reread some Wittgenstein, particularly- Philosophical
Investigations -and everything by Francis Ponge I could find. All of this
finally brought me back to Baudelaire's prose poems which I read again and
again in English and which I sometimes I even tried to struggle with in
French. I am not sure why I am discussing my response to Louis Cabri's posts
on poetry and prose like this, by referring to specific works, but I think
what I want to say has to do with the notion of "prose poetry" not mentioned
in Cabri's piece. My current experience of the modernistic typographical
conventions of the poetic text - short lines, or repeated capitals at the
beginnings of long lines, the use of page space around short phrases
interestingly placed here and there on the page- is often one of impatience
and annoyance. The fact is, that for the past several years, I much prefer
to read poetry when it is written out in short or long sentences, in dense
paragraphs, or in short lines like aphorisms in Wittgenstein or in -the
Chinese Notebook-. Maybe Louis Cabri can explain to me why this is.  Perhaps
he already has in his piece, but it is not coming through to me yet. David
Markson's books -Reader's Block- (Dalkey Archive, 1996) and -This Is Not a
Novel- (Counterpoint 2001) are written in single sentences for the most
part, or in short paragraphs separated by three spaces. Despite the
disturbing subject matter (he is often obsessed with the causes of writer's
deaths and the anti-Semitism of various famous people throughout history,
which are laconically catalogued throughout his books) I read and reread
these books with great pleasure, for one thing, because of their clear
attempt to efface the differences between poetry and prose. Am I gutlessly
wondering why I so much prefer prose poetry to any other setting for
contemporary writing? Perhaps  Mr. Cabri might be convinced to try a hand at
diagnosing my poetic malady.

Nick,

     Itoccurs to me as I read this that what I have been doing lately and
have called investigative poetry for lack of better nomenclature fits
somewhere in this spectrum although I'm not sure where.  I have found that
as a poet and also a psychologist some bits come out as poetry and some come
out as dry and factual and I leave it to the reader (or viewer) to
combinethem from his or her perspective.  It's more of a process or poetic
research than text-based format can accomadate as it incorporates links and
can incorporate the visual or gestural.  While it begins with Sanders, I
think this way of working owes more to my experiences on the net and online
support groups and listserv mail jumbles than anything else.

In it's current form the piece is five pages but I'll send a copy to those
who ask, but enough self-promo for tonight.

At first I thought you were saying "huysmansization of
prose" and meant, a` la ~A Rebours~, a
compartmentalization of it into separate rooms, each
painted a different color, or a sort of museum of
perfumes of prose--- but, dyslexia blinked away, I see
you must mean Napoleon III's Baron Hausmann, architect
of the re-design of Paris . . . in which case I
understand even less what you mean by that (or find it
less interesting when corrected, too real).

{My review of ~Pierce-Arrow,~ from ~America Letters &
Commentary~ 12, 2000, p. 178f (a necessarily
simplified reading, given the genre [review])}



     When I asked, like a starstruck autograph hound,
to be introduced to Susan Howe after her poetry
reading, her instructions to me were direct: since I
work at a university, the library there probably owns
the microfilm of the complete papers of Charles
Sanders Peirce, hero of her new book, ~Pierce-Arrow,~
and---almost beside herself with happiness for me---I
could ~see the manuscripts for myself!~  This poetry
points outside itsel, like Cupid's arrow, with an
evangelism foreign to post-modernism.  Out of a
doctrinally non-referential Language Poetry
background, Howe is vigorously ~referring~ and
signifying back to an extrinsic world.  That world,
though, is not a monolith we can return to unlettered.
 Howe has a didactic streak (poetry should delight and
instruct) and her lesson is our almost primal
ignorance before a protean world.  The past,
historical or personal, was neve something the rote
memorization of schoolrooms could teach.
     She writes: "Occamists frequently commit /
mistakes Hume falls into / error it may be simple /
error on my part."  Linguists and poets keep asking:
what is the smallest unit of meaning---the word? The
syllable? The phoneme?  Regardless, Howe proves
insistently that the ~sound bite~ our age speaks is
smaller than whatever that atom may be.  To explain
the known in the terms of the unknown (Occam's razor)
is to ask the sub-set to contain everything that lies
outside it.
     I do not agree with the self-evident reading of
Howe as a "poet of history," despite the dates she
endlessly, cabalistically ticks off ("In 1900
Swinburne who died / in 1909 just a month before /
Meredith", "Sunday Feb 15 / Deep snow / Blood was in a
/ little while", "In 1928 after Husserl's / last pen
touched the MS / it was set aside", "Exhausted
certainty / after 1900 ink dis- / persed randomly",
etc., etc.), as if metrics were measured in years.
Howe simply holds us responsible for our naïve
numerologies---the historical is interchangeable with
the ~imaginary~ in her poetry, and phenomenologically
(the book begins: "Phenomenology of war in the ~Iliad~
/ how men appear to each other when / gods change the
appearance of things") what those two modes share in
common is ~absence.~  Her great theme is what is not
here.  It is covered over with ink, and has serif or
no serif.

Thomas. (And Listees) I used to work with a guy called Tom Bell: he was a
cable jointer: one day (some time after I left the telecom field) I was
writing a series and had forgotten the word for  "dresser" (a wooden or
plastic tool used to beat lead into shape (nowadays of course fibreoptic
technology has replaced that)) but his comment was, when I said I was
putting (some of our old work processes and trade "secrets" into a poem) "Is
there much money in that?" (Poetry he menant)!!  Tom was a skilled lineman
and cable jointer: and a bloody good bloke and still is...of course there
have to be millions of Tom Bells!! But if you ever see my "Chains" I link
_his_ name with Bell Telephone and him and Telecommunications (the field I
was in) and so on in a chain of statement-response poems called "Chains"...
but re what you have said below: I agree, the connection/interaction of the
personal or confessional is problematic and interesting: example I think
that Ashbery's poetry on one level is like some of the dreams he might have
had but they may have actually helped him: or they may have made no
differnece but in one sense for us all creativity is therapeutic..in the
sense that eating is or laughing or sex or whatever: I mean all of us in
being creative may be just (partly) working or reworking our possible dreams
(and thus creativity like sleep is neccessary to everyone, I feel )...I  see
language poetry or Confessionalism as not separate per se or in boxes
(sometimes unfortunately neccessary) as you imply and also as aspects of
creativity: they are all different dimensions or "angles" of thought: I
think that Nick felt that Millie was trivialising it into the gauche
interpretation of "fun"  (forgive me if I say the obvious you are clearly in
the pschocological area like Nick) ... but in a sense its ALL valid: the
lyric transformed to something rich and strange, Mills and Boon to some
people, Soaps on TV for some, Conceptual Art or "pure" Mathematics for
others: or the Bach I was listening to tonight for me: or maybe another time
it'll be jazz or Bob Marley or whatever...but talking about Lang Poetry I
was just in town (Auckland, New Zealand ) (at the Auck University Library)
and reading some books by 1) There was Ashbery's "At A Masque " in a
collection (not the American Poetry) 2) Two books by Tina Darragh - one
involving dreams - fascinating: stimulating.  3) A double by Alice Notley
(not a Language Peoet ) but I dont need to be convinced of her greatness. 4)
What loked like arecent Bruce Andrews but not in his usual style - a
departure - didnt have time to explore that (although I have done many of
his other books: brilliant stuff. 5) Something about "The Orchard keeper" by
Cormac McCarthy which I read in its first edition and the bookseler inme let
go on eBay!!(and which doesnt have anything directly to do with lang poetry
etc (and I didnt get onto that, the discussion) and last and most marvellous
5) Nick Piombino's book of mostly prose poetry (I think it was "Tarditional
Objects")...I dont have the superlatives for the writing in that book. That
is - I havent got a non-dull epithet - it blasted me: some of those things
are by a writer of incredible ability..
   All in all there is a lot of fascinating writing still going on just by
so-called "centre-field" of the language poets (and that acknowledges
retallack and many others I havent mentioned)...but reading them its
important to realise that a lot of the skills in reading into and in other
regions or dimensions of literature and other writing apply and one has to
approach from new ones...no one of these writers could be said to be samey:
Nick possibly is closer to Bernstein than Darragh: but they are very
different consciousnesses: we all are: we are all unique.      Richard
Taylor.  (Please note the Taylor..but it doesnt matter too much...)

a ride with someone if needed, if willing to pitch in for gas, etc.

also, i am still looking for somewhere to crash for those two weeks
while in town. thanks to those who previously suggested the hostel,
but if anyone knows of any room someone might have in a house nearby,
please backchannel to me.

best,

Richard,

I too am a big fan of Tom Veitch's work, though I certainly wouldn't
know of his work (except from comics) if he weren't an old family
friend.  He and my father Darrell (a fantastic musician and
experimental instrument builder) used to hang together in San
Francisco when I was I kid.  It's been decades since I've seen anyone
in the Veitch family, but I do know that Tom has worked in comics in
the last two decades -- he wrote a series entitled *Abraxas* that was
illustrated by his brother, Rick Veitch, and published in Epic
Magazine. He also wrote a comics mini-series that was highly
acclaimed that involved mysticism and the Vietnam War (though I can't
remember offhand what the series was called).  More recently he's
been involved with the new Star Wars films -- my friend and I came
across his name on a Star Wars listserve while we were finding out
about Episode I before it came out and revealed itself to be a
monstrosity.  I also think he may have written several of the Star
Wars comics that worked to tie together the movie plotlines and the
plotlines of the Star Wars comics that had exceeded what the movies
themselves had to tell us.  I used to have a cache of his books, but
my dad took them back (more's the pity).

Trane

p.s. You could always try a google search on his name if you want more.

Trane. Thanks. I just fluked onto that: I remember his photograph (of
himself) was very funny: and his poetry was interesting:

             Ordinary People on Sunday

          ....Overwhelmed by the postman's love
              The girl throws herself from the roof of a building-
              Meanwhile the Rajah of Eshnapur
              is torn to death by tigers - grief strikes -
              again she takes her life...

It may be a satire of Daddy or the poems of Plath...but it goes on about a
whole lot of crazy suicides (vaguely recalls Pynchon of "The Crying of Lot
49"):

          but ..    A powerful secret society pays of

There have been too many messages to follow but I just read someone quoting
someone about how the fakelangpo thing was an example of manic depressive
guts, or something to that effect.  I don't deny that the expression of it
(actually bothering to build a site and trying to populate it, [which I'm
still trying to do -- I'd just like a site in which poetry is discussed in
an honest way], ewas a manic effort.  Non manics wouldn't have though of
maning an actual web site devited to a non-movement, nor had they thought of
it, would they botrher actually do it.  We do have a tendenacy to carry out
our jokes anstead of just letting them go back to the place of all jokes
which are funny once but which have now, quite honorably, died.

HOWEVER, the idea behind fakelangpo is one I'll stand by.  People read
poetry because they like it,  they find something in it that resonates with
their own thoughts or feelings (ones they couldn't say as well as the poet)
or they are amused by it (often the case with Language Poetry), or they are
aestheitically moved by uimagery, or the ideas are new and exciting, or the
form is something they've never seen and they enjoy puzzling out how it
works and why it still works (also a draw of some Language Poetry), or maybe
it does something else to them that they can't identify, but the point is,
PEOPLE READ POETRY BECAUSE THEY LIKE IT.

This seems so obvious that you wouldn't think it would have to be stated,
but discussions of poetics often make it sound as if the point of the poem
is the theory.  The point of the poem is firstly, that it gave the author
some pleasure to write it, or else he felt compelled to write it, or it was
a piece of a a larger program that the poet has chosen because he likes it.
Secondly, the poem exists because some reader likes it, and will want to
read it, and an editor recognizes that a reader will want to read it.

Moreover, I maintain that everyone on the poetics list is here because .....
THEY LIKE READING POETRY.  So I wanted to start a discussion about Language
poetry (and I tried to do this by conventinal means before the fakelangpo
escapade) of which language poems people liked and why, what it was about
them that made them "Language poems"  What exactly it is in the poetry which
deliberately fails to produce most of the sources of entertainment that
other poetry has (like narrative and lyricism) that nonetheless draws
readers?  Is it just humor?  I wanted to discuss specific works, but no one
wanted to discuss anything that concrete.  No one even used a spefif work as
an example of what they were talking about.

So fakelangpo was supposed to be Language Poetry for the masses, where you
could say "I tried to read bla bla bla but couldn't get through it, yet I've
heard it's a seminal work.  What am I missing?"  and someone else would
answer...  But people got caught up in the name of the site.  I chose it
just because it is the "fake" way to approach language poetry, the
philistine's way.  It was only after wards that parodies came into the
picture, once I realized the name could be taken that way.

I love how everyone assumes I'm naive and underread...it's actually pretty
funny since I've read a lot of poetry, including Language Poetry.  I just
have never been in an English department or taken a theory class.  Many of
my philistine ideas about poetry come from two semesters of modern poetry
lecture by Kenneth Koch in college.  I think I am parroting his ideas to
some extent...the class was a strong influuence on me.

I read it.  I did a major prject on the long popem in grad school (MFA) and
used Pierce-Arrow as an aexample (the whole book, arguing that the whole
book is one work, divided into parts; one could say this about any poetry
collection of course but I think it's actually true about Pierce-Arrow.)
Howe does a neat job of forcing you to NOT believe in the myths she recounst
while she is recounting them (which she tells in poetry as rich, in a
contemporary way, as well as any other modern teller of these stories - it
is perhaps the besty Tristan et Isolde (but for its incompleteness) in
English) because she also tells about the people who told the stories before
he, e.g. Swinburne, Tennyson, and about the society i which they lived as
seen through the esxistence of someone like Pierce, a scholar and eccentric
who would not be able to exist now or earlier in history; the Victorian
period ws the era for amateur scholars...

I know the real point is the prosody but I haven't got the book in front of
me so I can't comment, except to say that she manages to narrate without
narrating; events are there but she doesn't supply a linked string of them
in order, she supplies lines about them which are intelligible to varying
degrees based on our already knowing the story.  That's interesting because
it suggests that other LP which seems incoherent or hard to understand could
be a _way_ of saying things in a difficult to understand manner rather than
a deliberate effort not to say anything...this doesn't seem to be usually
the case though, although one gets this sense in some of Clark Coolidge's
work (the long poems).

Bryan Murphy | Angola Poems

"Death of an Orphan-grinder" and "More than a Game"

Bryan Murphy was born and raised in England. As an adult, his ability to
teach English as a foreign language has enabled him to live and work in
places like Portugal, Angola, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Bulgaria,
mostly at times of profound but rapid social and political transition. It
was Angola which made the deepest impact. He now works as a translator in
Turin, Italy. Although he is a relative newcomer to poetry, his work has
appeared in Erosha, Intercultural Platform, Melange, Moveo Angelus,
Snakeskin, Switched-On Gutenberg, and elsewhere, including the 2001 Venice
Biennale. He prefers electronic to print outlets because of their editors'
faster responses and their more international audience.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

Your Tom Bell has got the right question, "Is there much money in that?"

Came across this by chance today on
'"angles" of thought:' (Rcihard tyler's apt pharse):
"Subtly or overtly, then, genre molds facts, events, and speech to fit its
contours, and a narrative of suffering will undergo significant changes
depending on whether it takes the form of, say, a documentary film, a TV
miniseries,...." -David Morris, _Illness and Culture in the Postmodern Age_,
Cal, 1998

and Jason wrote on another thread here:
"where and how will visual poetries find themselves an anchor to swing
around
in this listing?" - curious that I have seen no mention of _Homo Sonorus_
here as it puts an internationaland histoical perspective on 'sound' and
performance poetry.

The poet-teacher Paul Bennett died Tuesday in Granville, Ohio at the age
of 81, from an advanced stage of prostrate cancer.  He was my teacher at
Denison University, where he taught for over 40 years, and the author of
several books -- three works of fiction (one forthcoming), a lovely young
adult's novel, <Follow the River> (1987), and three volumes of poems,
most recently, <Appalchian Mettle> (Savage Press 1997).

Perhaps some of you met him at Denison over the years?  He was a fine man
and an interesting writer; as a teacher of poetry he was perhaps something
more than that -- he certainly was to me -- someone with the gift of
understanding the place of his own work within what used to be called the
literary system, who understood, in other words, the significance of the
relationships developed between his students, their writing, and his
cultivation of it, of them, a set of promises, and sacrifices, carried out
in the name of poetry, of literature, of citizenship, of the human, after
all, for Paul was a humanist, if not in practice (for he was no scholar),
then in faith.

In practice Paul was a poet-teacher.  I have an idea of what this means,
though I got it from Paul, and it seems to me we're still living in the
time of the poet-teacher -- it's a new post:  settled by men like Paul.
As an artisan, Paul was a vernacular modernist -- at his very best, a
Blakean modernist, in the American tradition of The Kindergarten Chats, of
Frank Lloyd Wright and Charles and Ray Eames (like them Paul designed and
built his own house in the late 40s on one of the most beautiful hillsides
in Central Ohio),of Buster Keaton and Whitman and Laura Riding (like
Riding, who ran her own press, Bennett published three of his own
books),Jess Collins and Orson Welles and I'm sure many others. A late modernist
who came of age -- the last of the seven children of an Irish-born
Gnadenhutten, Ohio farmer -- in the death-throes of Internationalism and
the late-Thirties reaction against Eliot, Paul went directly from Ohio
University (where he'd gone on an academic scholarship) into the Naval
Reserves, and -- on the G.I. Bill -- (postwar) took a Masters at
Harvard, taught for a year at the University of Maine-Orono, before
joining the Denison faculty in 1947. A time of the New Criticism at
Harvard (from his classroom I think I recall Paul's speaking of Reuben
Brower; I'm sure I recall the mention of F.O. Matthiessen), though a kind
of cultural radicalism develops at this time, as well, with Irving
Babbitt's student Norman Foerster quitting the East Coast to begin the
Iowa Writers Program not too long before Paul began one of the first
undergraduate writing concentrations at Denison in 1953. It occurs to me,
though the literary history of this time in academia has yet to be written
(Gerald Graff's book is certainly a start), that between the War and the
Mid-fifties (R..P. Blackmur at Princeton in the late Thirties is one of
the first), the poet-teacher-post gets sucked out of the ear of the
University by a postwar education boom, the G.I. Bill, and the Cold War
apostacy of American progressives against social reconstruction -- an
ideological clash, one result of which seems to have been the impatient
precipitant wish to have an American Literature (so we could have then an
American Studies), and the University's need to have writers to write the
literature they wanted to study.

Whether, in the building of Denison's program, he didn't have time to
write much of his own work in the Fifties, or what, I've not read Paul's
work produced during this period -- is anyone out there
aware of it? But the roster of Paul's students who date from the Fifties
is impressive:  the novelists Paul Shellford and Clark Blaise, the
poet Dennis Trudell, and scholar and naturalist (not the poet) Frederick
Turner.  Perhaps it's not all that unusual for a teacher of 40 years to
have successful students, but Senator Richard Lugar (R-Ind) and Disney CEO
Michael Eisner also date from this period of Paul's mentoring them. In the
Sixties it appears that he began to publish his work a good bit more; here
is a poem that The Nation published in the late Sixties:

The Power to Make War

Built to swing like arbors in the wind
Multi-colored, iridescent as summer wings
The feeding cones hang, but no birds come.
Here and elsewhere death stalks the hills,
Birds and men move furtively, without sound;
Sharp eyes probe each leaf and twig's turning,
For movement, antithesis of death, brings death.

Growing up in a village soaked in blood
By the wanton murder of ninety-six
Men, women, and children,
I early learned not to dig the mound
On which we lay to play our games;
A friend, turning soil with his bare hands,
Unearthed bone fragments scalloped by worms.

Here and elsewhere the power to make war
Unsettles minds; as if gun, napalm and bomb
Could restore the necessary dream.
Even as nature recoils
From the nightmare of their acts,
Mesmerized men, counseled of their kind,
Automate death, and shattered bodies bleed.

        #       #       #       #

I see no considerable problem with this poem (from one of the books Paul
self-published, the 1975 <A Strange Affinity>) -- I reckon it a plausible
act of witness, the solace of hope right up front, where it needs to be,
but understood for what it is: a premise, merely, doubled, perhaps, by
those scalloping worms that seem to have failed to recoil as has the
speaker and the rest of nature.  Like those worms, Paul was himself an
avid gardener (his house and property really should become an Ohio
landmark), and, in the days before the Internet, an avid correspondent
(writing Paul, you could on faith rely upon an envelope in your
mailbox 4-5 days later), whose cultivation of student-writers went on long
after said students graduated; and perhaps some of these folks ought to be
mentioned: they include (please let me know who I've missed) Kathy Mangan,
Deborah Pope, Dianne Goodman, Molly O'Neill, Pam Houston, Amy Pence, Ann
Townsend, Rick Boyer, Deb Allbery, and Angela Peckinpaugh.

In the classroom, Paul liked to read the work of students who had
gone on and done distinctive work, and whether or not
it was actually Paul who had taught them at Denison, his classroom was
used as a space to build the institution of the Denison Writing Program --
so that if Paul asked one of the students in the room to read their own
poem, or story, it was a measure of some company to have performed one's
aspirations in the presence of those who had succeeded (however modestly)
in them before. In the early Sixties he happened upon (as he told it) a
patron for the writing program and established the Beck Lectureship,
a short term residency which during my undergraduate period brought
Eudora Welty and Stephen Dunn to campus; I've seen the list of all
the Beck Lecturers, and interestingly enough, a fairly wide spectrum of
American writing from the period came to Denison (one name that sticks
in my head, for example, is (someone else I revere) Robert Duncan).

Those who met him during these years may not be surprised to learn (I
wasn't) that when Paul was diagnosed with cancer in 1994, he was given six
weeks to live, but responded well to the chemo treatment, and like many
patients had a kind of reprieve from that dour sentence.  When I heard in
early March that he had been told that he could take no more treatment for
the problem, other than some inadequate pain relievers, I called him up
thinking he would be on his deathbed.  He was more or less housebound (a
kind of helpmate, and frequently his son, were there, since he had lost
his wife Jeanne in 1995), but he delighted to tell me that he was still
getting around the house, and that his doctor (whom he actually seemed to
admire a lot) had given him a few days yet to live. The spirit of this was
that he was finding some comfort in the accelerating accuracy of the
doctor's prognosis.  He lived for almost three more months.  I don't wish
for this story to suggest some sort of ridiculous
inconquerability-scenario -- only to suggest a bit Paul's capacity to
amuse himself, his sense of irony, which, for those who might have had the
chance to meet him on the poetry circuit, will remain in my memory, at
least.

Hey Jim!

Looks like Kelly and I have found a gig in Gloucester!  IF all the
headaches work out we'll be up there August 1.

Hey, our place here in Brookline is real cheap for what it is, only
$1250 now with perhaps a slight increase.  You looking for a gig at that
time?  I'd rather pass the sweet deal on to someone we know.  It has two
and a half bedrooms, so you could split it with one, perhaps two folks.

I think the C's are done.  Oh well, a great run.

I may miss yr reading next week.  Good luck...

Sez me, having come back from the dead.

I'm very interested by the discussion of tone and textures in e-mails that
has gone on in the last few days, I think it very pertinent to the nature of
lists, what I am minded of in that respect is the paradox that although
e-mails are in the fixities of print they are also very verbal in nature, so
one gets the casual and throwaway nature of conversation with the sometimes
unhappy effect of it being, as it were, graven in letters of stone.

This isn't directly related to poetry and poetics and I'm not particularly interested inpoetic/philosohical opinion as there is now sufficient empirical research on this treatment I think so that I can offer it as an email group experience for those interested in participant.  I'm still experimenting and working out procedures so for the trial run I'll give list members a 10 per cent discount.

What i am doing is a brief (six session) group in Writing for the Health of It (any chronic illness including all forns of depressions).  Since I'm doing it on a professional level there are some requirements to join, but if anyone is interested bc me and I'll send a description and requirements including cost.
