LEE ANN BROWN


reading her poetry

Thursday March 4th.


Bachelor Reading Room, Bachelor Hall. Miami University, Oxford. Ohio. 8pm.
Free. ALL welcome.



Lee Ann Brown is a poet and filmmaker. She founded Tender Buttons press in
1989, a press dedicated to publishing experimental women's poetry, with the
publication of Bernadette Mayer's Sonnets. Ten years later, in April 1999,
her own first full-length collection, Polyverse, appeared from Sun & Moon
Press and won the New American Poetry Series Award. Her second book, The
Sleep That Changed Everything, came out in 2003 from Wesleyan and secured
her recognition as an important American woman poet at the turn of the early
Twenty-first century. A renowned workshop leader at the Naropa Institute in
Colorado, she is currently an Assistant Professor at St Johns University in
New York City.

"In the vexed and mainly irrelevant arena of allegiances to teachers and
predecessors, Brown has pioneered a refreshing indifference to the rivalries
between, say, Beats and New York School poets, or New York School poets and
practitioners of projective verse, or for that matter between the language
poets and the rest of the world. Collaging her influences from all these
groups, collaborating with them, trimming her work with declarations that
her attraction's more than textual, she is a central figure to many groups
of younger poets. Born in Japan, raised in North Carolina, taking two
degrees at the school that shares her name, and settling down in New York,
she comes to her rejection of categorization honestly. Among younger poets,
her absolute refusal to accept limits on what is permissible has given her
something like political power."  - Jordan Davis

"Pleasure is the subject of Lee Ann Brown's poetry. Pleasure in the craft
and anti-craft of poem making. Pleasure in the vocalizing and harmonizing of
voice and text--speech and writing. Giddy recombinings. Flirtatious
collaborations. Irreverent anagrams." - Eliane Equi


"Shout, whisper, and strum these mercurial poems, old-time lyrics, and
inventive translations and transpositions. Lee Ann Brown's The Sleep That
Changed Everything is a sprung formalist ode to the 'open possibilities' of
song." - Charles Bernstein

dear Steve:

i noted that you begin with criticizing Silliman's remarks someplace (it wa=
sn't indicated precisely where/when on the blog) of dramatic monologue--is =
this critique re Browning=2C Pound=2C Lowell??--(i gather from your remarks=
 it is most definitely the last named--that is involved)--is it a critique =
of a specific dramatic monologist or dramatic monologists in general=2C  in=
 the English language=2C to be sure=2C it goes without saying---?

i rarely read Silliman's blog=3B my impression is very often that it in its=
elf is a long long ongoing extended and if not necessarily completely/alway=
s a "dramatic" monologue=2C then most certainly an extended rhetorical mono=
logue--

i gather that perhaps the soliloquy is NOT tossed in with the dramatic mono=
logue??--

might David Antin be considered a dramatic monologist?--how about the creat=
or of Swimming to Cambodia?--sections of Jackson MacLow or Lorine Niedecker=
?--Hannah who saw words?--

there is a great deal of Silliman's blog=2C going by what i have read=2C th=
at could be considered basically among the more rhetorical forms of dramati=
c monologue--

are stream of consciousness monologues such as molly Bloom's among the dete=
sted "dramatic monologues?"--

is a specific definition of dramatic monologue given that is being applied?=
--
let me know the particular passages of which you write--

are narrators such as Conrad
's Marlowe types of "dramatic monologists?--"

how about the extended solos taken by Jazz and blues=2C rock'n'roll musicia=
ns-classical artists---are these form of dramatic monologue?  soliloquies?-=
-

are certain Ballad forms "dramatic monologues?"--

are "criticism" and "reviewing" and "literary memoirs" of the Silliman vari=
ety not so much providing "critical=2C essay=2C researched theorizing=2C et=
c" thinking=2C but instead providing the reader with a form of rhetorical d=
ramatic monologue with intentions of being the "final word" rather than the=
 "opening words=2C" opening that is outwo/ard=2C away from the monologue an=
d pointing also away from the author & monologues' themselves towards an ex=
panding area of questions=2C of ways of writing=2C of thinking=2C of encour=
aging DIY (do-it-yourself) in an inspirational/exemplary manner???--

please note i am not trying to start an argument(s) but hoping to open the =
questions and observations up=2C towo/ards more questions and areas--re the=
 topics--

isn't perhaps Silliman's blog also a form of "confessional writing?"--as wi=
th much contemporary avant writing=2C so often concerned with the "confessi=
onal" aspect of writing re one's memories=2C life=2C jobs=2C favorite tv sh=
ows=2C pastimes=2C book lists=2C etc --with "events and behaviors=2C though=
ts=2C attitudes=2C emotions since 9/11???"--

is the blog in itself not a form of confessional writing=2C even when essay=
ing to restrict the blog writings to "literary thoughts?"--as these are bou=
nd up with the personal=2C the subjective=2C "the 'I'"--?? with ethical jud=
gments on Good and Evil--

aren't often things that a particular poet=2C writer=2C is very concerned w=
ith making a critique of from a more or less subjective viewpoint--are not =
these often simply the projections of aspects of ones' self=2C one's  chara=
cter=2C thoughts=2C on to others and their thoughts=2C viewpoints?--is this=
 part of the seemingly endless dividing up of writers=2C poets=2C forms of =
writing in to the US Goverment style of "Good vs Evil"? rhetoric and propag=
anda--and--what and why is this so important=2C this use of ethics as a for=
m of literary criticism=2C in order  to show oneself=2C one's group=2C one'=
s Brand and Rebranded form of writing as the Good and others' as the Bad an=
d the Ugly?--

why is for example "Opacity" in writing so Good--and transparency Bad--whil=
e the same person=2C poet may be crying for the Government to be "more tran=
sparent?"--esp when the nature of governmental rhetoric and ventures=2C pla=
ns are quite distinctly designed often to be of the most opaque nature?

in a sense--what could not be more transparent!! then the desire that one's=
 words be opaque=2C while another's be transparent--

besides monologues=2C aren't there also stereologues=2C digitalogues--linco=
ln logs--blogalogs--logologues--egologues--ideologues--langologues--lingolo=
gues--jingologues--here alogue there a logue hear alogue their alogue . . .=
 everyone everywhere alogues . . . lumberjack ologues..the o'logues of the =
o'paque alogues . . .onan ologues . . .

I=92m pleased to announce the publication
of my second full-length collection of poetry,

Sonnets

(Shearsman Books / Exeter, U.K.)
http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2010/martin.html

=93In her second book of poetry, Camille Martin breathes fresh life into th=
e sonnet in a collection that is at once edgy and lyrical. The word =91sonn=
et=92 comes from =91song,=92 and the musicality of Sonnets is not surprisin=
g, given Martin=92s background as a classical musician.

These poems demonstrate a virtuosic range of approaches and themes; some ar=
e inspired by texts as disparate as nursery rhymes, theories of cognitive s=
cience, a history of street names, and her own dream journals. The chorus o=
f voices in this collection sing confidently and fluently, proving the sonn=
et to be an ideal vehicle for Martin=92s love affair with language.=94
--Shearsman Books

=93Sonnets is a delightful body of work. Even though we wander into the obl=
ique there is never alienation . . . Incredible poetic craft.=94
--Stride Magazine

=93Camille Martin's Sonnets bring the old form into the 21st century. In so=
me ways, they are almost traditional; the speaker addresses a not-so-well b=
eloved, a figure who occupies a =91fraudulent elsewhere,=92 an elusive love=
r or, more likely, another version of the poet herself. Identity theft is a=
n issue here where we find ourselves =91comatose in paradise but happy happ=
y/feet! is this where I want to go? thrust/into an age unfavourable to bein=
g/a guest in one's own home?=92 In these taut, fast-paced, self-aware poems=
, the lyric meets 21st century paranoia and sparks fly.=94
--Rae Armantrout

=93In the tradition of the chansonnier, this collection of sonnets encompas=
ses the sacred and the secular, tracing =91perfection and fear=92 across bo=
rders we may never have known were there or near. Martin, the virtuoso, wel=
comes the unsafe, perpetually-tested beauty, declaring that =91i=92m so/acc=
ustomed to frozen rivulets on rocks/i don=92t see them anymore./now I do.=
=92 These sonnets offer a geography of the possible, invoking questions, ch=
allenges, songs of praise, and fact. The miracle of these songs is a precis=
ion that earns infinity of choice, =91even as we dissolve into the wilderne=
ss of my voice.=92 Camille Martin=92s poems shimmer with repetition deft as=
 sweetest breath mid-spring.=94
--Sheila E. Murphy

=93In Camille Martin=92s Sonnets, the tongue knots the next line or drools =
with anarchists crouched in pentameter. Here language plays instants=97a ca=
reful cadence pounding amok in the metric. In these poems we seep into four=
teen layers of syllabic strata, our tonsils swollen and burlesque with visi=
ons of seducing Martin=92s fluorescent incisions. Each of Martin=92s syllab=
les flood; both in geology and in mouths, and the image of course, that whi=
ch tsunamis our own limits of language=97such a pleasure and fear in the dr=
ench. Here, in this architecture of flood, gardens and grammar, the visitor=
 stumbles and mouths disorient in the pleasure of ripe incoherence. What I =
want to say is that the language here hoards blooms or grips to the minute =
synaptic parasail=92s that still are caught in weather systems when the rea=
ding is over. There is magnificence in these poems, a poetic magnetic, prop=
elling you to turn the page.=94

it was a game for the pucky ages: canada vs slovakia for a berth in the
olympic gold medal game at the vancouver winter olympics of 2010. for the
ages? ya sure. ah but the olympics are storied over ages.

the canadians dominated the first two periods, winning the first period 2-0
and the second period 1-0 with ryan getzlaf's goal, the 3-0 goal, which
would
prove to be the winner. the slovakians were to play a third period like
few others we have seen in hockey before, with such skill and determination
that the outcome of the game was not decided until the final horn blared and
the vancouver audience went bonkers, absolutely bonkers with delight over
the thrilling 3-2 game and its momentous outcome for the beleagured canuck
squad recovered from their earlier loss to the usa and problems against much
lower-rated clubs.

we learned that marian gaborick, the foxy slovak winger who plays for the
new york rangers, makes plays behind his own back that are so clever and
deceptive even he himself is caught by surprise.

we saw ryan getzlaf, the strongly emerging canadian star, execute the best
backhand shot i have ever seen in my life from the slot into the top left
corner of the slovakian net--a net manned like a human spider by jaroslav
halak, the montreal canadiens's goalie. halak pounced like a hairy,
heavily-padded spider around the net. only the truly bona fide unstoppable
shots made it past halak.

we saw marian hossa, another of the wily slovak wingers, cause two canadians
to crash into one another while hossa dipsy doodled past the keystone
canadian defenders. but hossa did not score. while the two crumpled
canadians dusted themselves off and got up quickly, other canadian defenders
mobilized to deal with hossa's magic, and he didn't even get a shot on net,
that time.

the first two canadian goals, in the first period, were both deflections of
screen shots from well inside the blue line. halak stood no chance
whatsoever. halak kept the slovakians in the game with brilliant save after
brilliant save, while roberto luongo, the canadian netminder, was effective
but not challenged to display the arachnoid quicksilver that the slovakian
halak dazzled us with time after time.

the third period. o the third period and the glove from above. the story of
the glove from above.

but, first, recall brodeur's last bat. in the qualification round, three
games earlier, martin brodeur, the canadian national team's netminder since
his brilliant 2002 gold medal performance in salt lake city, perhaps the
most celebrated goaltender of all time, faltered in the canadian goal during
a 5-3 loss to the usa. early in the game, the usamericans blazed past the
center line and dumped the puck in, forcing brodeur to play it with his
stick well out of his crease. brodeur batted the moving puck cricket-style,
attempting to clear the zone. instead, the puck went directly to a
usamerican forward who promptly shot it in the gaping canadian net. this
fate was also to befall mikka kiprusof, the finnish goalkeeper, in the
finnish-usa game, a startling reenactment of what appears to be a
semi-planned play on the part of the usamericans: charge into the zone in
the first minutes of the game, shoot the puck in in such a way as to force
the goalie to come out and play the puck with the stick while the forwards
close in with terrifying deadly speed.  the usamericans have unmanned two of
the best goalies in the game this way by forcing them to make big mistakes
for very big, very bad goals. it rattled brodeur and it rattled kiprusof.
more bad goals followed, in both cases, and the two celebrated goalies were
chased from the net, ultimately and, very likely, from any further
first-string status on their respective national teams. the usa won both
those games against the canadians and the finns. the usa had their miracle
on ice in the 1980 olympics; the game against finland was their massacre on
ice. they clobbered the suddenly hapless and meek finns 6-0 in the first
period and cruised to a 6-1 victory.

this changing of the guard opened up, in the canadian's case, the
opportunity of a lifetime for roberto luongo, the backup canadian goaltender
who had not previously played any key games for the biggest canadian
national team. luongo did well enough in subsequent games with germany and
russia, winning them both, to earn the start against slovakia in the
semi-final. and the games were in vancouver, where luongo plays for the
vancouver canucks in the nhl. in fact he is captain canuck, the only goalie
captain of an nhl team. his rink. his crowd. his country. and what a luongo
crowd. they chant "llllouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu"
every time he makes a save, an awed and appreciative serenade of the
canadian netminder every time he does anything. and they wail it with
fervent devotion when he performs spectacular, sprawling, game-saving
gymnastics on his keister.

the glove from above came with 9 seconds left in the game. the score was
3-2 for the canadians against the deadly slovaks who were pressing like
vlad's overwhelming forces in upon the canadian net for a goal and a chance
to play overtime. luongo's vancouver canuck teammate pavol demitra, now
playing for slovakia, was left with the puck at the side of the net with
lots of open space to smack the puck into the goal. somehow the puck stayed
out and glanced off the crossbar away from the net. several replays showed
that luongo sprawled to place his glove quite close to--and above--the spot
where demitra shot the puck. this forced demitra to shoot high. did the puck
glance off luongo's glove and then the post? commentators said it was so.
the glove from above. they said it was so. let us say the faithful do indeed
believe unto fervent devotion in vancouver and canada where hockey is not a
religion but an obsession totally out of control.

perhaps we shall never know. perhaps unseen video will show it more clearly.
the mysterious glove from above. did luongo touch the puck at all? was it
divine intervention? or a trick of the camera? demitra put his hands over
his head and shook his head in astonishment and shock when the play ended,
the game was over, and utter joyful pandemonium ensued in the vancouver
audience and on the ice for the canadian team.

the glove from above trumped the brilliant performance of jaroslav halak
despite a questionable first goal against luongo where the clever slovaks
squeaked the puck behind luongo's knee via a corner shot from the goal line.
it didn't matter. the glove from above hovers in bright mystery as the
game-saving brilliance of a night full of brilliant plays by both squads.

the glove from above was the exclamation point on a stupendous third-period
performance by luongo. yes except for that first goal. he made timely saves.
he made quite a few of them in the third period when the slovaks outshot the
canadians 12-7 though, over the entire three periods, canada outshot the
slovaks 28-21.

the crowd, in the third period, when it was still 3-0 for canada, began
chanting "we want the usa". but as the slovaks closed in and made it a 3-2
game with 5 minutes left to play, that chant was totally silenced--the
canadians were made to worry very deeply about just hanging on for the last
5 minutes.

it was a thrilling conclusion to a match played so well it will indeed go
down in canadian hockey history as one of the most thrilling, well-played
games of all time. there were only 3 penalties in the entire game. the last
slovak penalty resulted in getzlaf's winning goal, while the slovaks could
not pot one during their one power play opportunity.

the luongo legend deepens as canada moves on to play the usa in the gold
medal game on sunday, two days from now, in a game that more or less every
canadian on the planet will want to watch. and, i imagine, many more
millions of usamericans. the usa has simply been perfect thus far in the
tournament. they have beaten everyone they've played in regulation time.
although they only have 3 olympic veterans on their squad, the young stars
have emerged as the most formidable and impressive team in the tournament.
they easily defeated canada 5-3 earlier in the tournament. and their
goaltender, ryan miller, has been as good as any other. let's hope it's a
beaut of a game.

Call for Papers (international conference, Universit=E9 du Maine, Le =
Mans, France, 14-16 October 2010)

  "Poets and Publishers: Circulating Avant-Garde Poetry (1945-2010)"

In the second half of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st, =
the material conditions of avant-garde poetry's circulation have come to =
the attention of critics. With the development of reader-response =
theory, research about the poets' ways of informing the larger public of =
their experiments has come to encompass technical considerations, =
economic, social and political preoccupations. Small presses-not the =
vanity presses of former times-thus became the laboratories of the =
publishing world, picking up on the latest avant-garde movements.

How do these publishers, and the poets who entrust their works to them, =
contribute to poetic innovation in a publishing context marked by =
commercial decline of the book and the poem alike? To what extent do =
small presses convey aesthetic initiatives that would otherwise remain =
"readerless"? Could one talk, along with American poet Barrett Watten of =
a "systemic de-totalization" bringing about new configurations of the =
poetic landscape into networks and archipelagoes?

We are inviting papers that will risk answers to these questions in the =
context of a wider reflection on the publishing world, its margins and =
its objects, notably poetic texts inspired and shaped by the recent =
advances of sociology, philosophy and cultural studies. The aim is a =
global assessment of the circulation of avant-garde poetry.

Blake Lecture 2:  Published Works

      initial event for a series curated by Eric Gelsinger

talk delivered by Douglas Manson

            with a reading of Blake's work

Sunday, February 28.  4:00 p.m.

99 Sutton Street #204, Greenpoint (Brooklyn)

            in the American Cork Building, please ring the Kevorkian bell
for entry


Blake is cool because he=92s a workshop for the mind of his readers, whethe=
r
they be thinkers, poets or painters.   His many works in text and design
provide a generous supply of ideas for re-thinking artistic practice and
performance.  He came to full maturity in the midst of multiple revolutions=
,
the results of which many would claim created our present social ideal of
harmony as an enlightenment inheritance.  Blake=92s work questions these
assumptions at the level of art and poetry.  The present lecture will focus
on his art: the style, techniques and themes of engravings and books in
which he intertwined language and visual design.  I will be using two
American examples as a way of comparing the kinds of attention viewers and
readers have given him in recent decades: the poetry of Gertrude Stein, and
the stories and graphic work found in titles published by Marvel Comics fro=
m
the early 1970s to the early 1980s.

Douglas Manson is a freelance academic, writer and micropublisher.  In 2004
he took a Ph.D. from U.Buffalo, and soon after started *little scratch pad
press* and *Celery Flute: The Kenneth Patchen Newsletter.*  He worries when
his rice supply is getting low.  Otherwise, he likes to make raucous music,
fly kites and argue about contemporary definitions of *good love* with his
friends in Brooklyn.


hope to see you there,

Doug

The Fifth International Conference on Ecological Discourse
December 16-18, 2010
Tamkang University, Taipei County, Taiwan

CALL FOR PAPERS

Ecocriticism in Asia:
Reorienting Modernity, Reclaiming Nature?

Deadline for submission of abstracts: March 9, 2010
Response to submissions: April 15, 2010

Contributions are invited for Tamkang University=92s Fifth International
Conference on Ecological Discourse. We seek papers that address Asian
interests and contexts in terms of diversely contested approaches to
=93modernity=94 and =93nature.=94 Papers that are cross-disciplinary in
purpose and scope are especially welcome. Such papers would intersect
with a broad range of Asian environmental issues and concerns not
limited to texts treated by scholars in the arts and humanities,
including ecocritical projects and initiatives that intersect with
biology, chemistry, economics, government policy, industry and
technology, the social sciences, and the natural sciences. The
conference aims to be representative of the many arguments emerging in
ecocritical discourse, including debates within specialized fields of
study as well as larger issues engendered by the crisis of
human-caused climate change affecting various places in Asia. In
addressing issues of modernity and nature in Asia, what can we gain by
reassessing the conceptual tools=97in the arts, literature and
philosophy=97that have been abandoned during centuries of colonialism
and modernization? Are there places and communities in Asia that
provide new models for development that could release the earth from
the expanding hegemony of global capital?

TOPICS

We welcome proposals which reconsider modernity and nature in
ecocriticism from an Asian-centered perspective. Possible topics
include (but are not limited to) the following:

 - ecocritical readings of Asian art, literature and film
 - literature, philosophy and religion and Asian ecologies
 - ecofeminism in Asia
 - ecology (Asian ecosystems, invasive species/native species, toxicity, et=
c.)
 - the impact of global warming in Asia
 - economic and demographic studies addressing climate change, food,
and species loss in Asia
 - animal trafficking and animal rights in Asia
 - bio/ecocentric public policy and political action in Asia
 - ecocomposition and writing ecologies
 - environmental justice/social justice/ecomarxism in Asia
 - space, place, and globalisation
 - biosemiotics
 - ecotourism and ecopornography in Asia
 - posthumanist readings of Asian art, literature and film including
the applications of cyborg theory.

The conference is organized by the English Department at Tamkang
University with the support of the Chemistry Department and the
recently formed Association of the Study of Literature and Environment
of Taiwan (ASLE-Taiwan).

ABSTRACT SUBMISSIONS

Proposals for individual papers and proposals for panels are both
invited. Presenters are asked to prepare 20-minute (3,000-word)

NO press is pleased to announce the publication of=20

Peter Jaeger's SEMINAR XVII

20 pages, sewn binding.
published in an edition of 40 copies (20 of which are for sale)
$5 each.

SEMINAR XVII is based on Lacan's seminar XVII, which has only recently =
been published in English for the first time. In this seminar, Lacan =
speaks about four discourses (master, university, hysteric, analyst). =
The master discourse is the underlying signifier that organizes all the =
others, and is taken either as the unified subject "I" or later, as =
impersonal bureaucracy. The university discourse bolsters up this sense =
of "I." The hysteric begins to question the master, and the analyst =
"coughs up" a new master signifier, in opposition to the"I."=20

just a reminder - this tuesday, March 2, at 6:00 pm, Katrinka Moore, Bob Heman, and Moira T. Smith will be joining together at the Cornelia St. Cafe to celebrate Katrinka's new book, Thief, just published by BlazeVOX Books - please come and join us for a memorable event - all the information follows
(the Cornelia St. Cafe is located at 29 Cornelia St., between Bleecker and West 4th, just around the corner from the West 4th St. A, C, E, B, D, and F station)


Come celebrate Thief with a reading/performance
by Katrinka Moore, Bob Heman & Moira T. Smith
at
Cornelia St. Café
29 Cornelia St., NYC
http://www.corneliastreetcafe.com/home.asp
Tuesday, March 2, 6:00 pm
Katrinka Moore’s book Thief was recently released by BlazeVOX [books]. She is a member of the One O’clock Poets, which published an anthology, The Full Green Hour, in 2008. Moore’s chapbook, This is Not a Story, won the New Women’s Voices prize and was published by Finishing Line Press in 2003.
Bob Heman has edited CLWN WR and its predecessor Clown War since 1971. His newest collection, Demographics, or, The Hats They Are Allowed to Wear, is available as a free download from Quale Press. His collages have been exhibited recently in group shows in Chelsea, D.U.M.B.O, and Williamsburg.
Moira T. Smith is a singer/song-writer/poet/bookworm/show-off who likes to get all dressed up and confront herself before a semi-captive audience. (That could be YOU!) She is "hilarious, disturbing, tender and mojo-rific!", or so says her deeply biased, but not inaccurate ego. Come on down and decide for yourself!

dear Steve:

i noted that you begin with criticizing
Silliman's remarks someplace (it wasn't indicated precisely where/when
on the blog) of dramatic monologue--is this critique re Browning=2C
Pound=2C Lowell??--(i gather from your remarks it is most definitely the
last named--that is involved)--is it a critique of a specific dramatic
monologist or dramatic monologists in general=2C  in the English
language=2C to be sure=2C it goes without saying---?

i rarely read
Silliman's blog=3B my impression is very often that it in itself is a
long long ongoing extended and if not necessarily completely/always a
"dramatic" monologue=2C then most certainly an extended rhetorical
monologue--

i gather that perhaps the soliloquy is NOT tossed in with the dramatic mono=
logue??--

might
David Antin be considered a dramatic monologist?--how about the creator
of Swimming to Cambodia?--sections of Jackson MacLow or Lorine
Niedecker?--Hannah who saw words?--

there is a great deal of
Silliman's blog=2C going by what i have read=2C that could be considered
basically among the more rhetorical forms of dramatic monologue--

are stream of consciousness monologues such as molly Bloom's among the dete=
sted "dramatic monologues?"--

is a specific definition of dramatic monologue given that is being applied?=
--
let me know the particular passages of which you write--

are narrators such as Conrad
's Marlowe types of "dramatic monologists?--"

how
about the extended solos taken by Jazz and blues=2C rock'n'roll
musicians-classical artists---are these form of dramatic monologue?=20
soliloquies?--

are certain Ballad forms "dramatic monologues?"--

are
"criticism" and "reviewing" and "literary memoirs" of the Silliman
variety not so much providing "critical=2C essay=2C researched theorizing=
=2C
etc" thinking=2C but instead providing the reader with a form of
rhetorical dramatic monologue with intentions of being the "final word"
rather than the "opening words=2C" opening that is outwo/ard=2C away from
the monologue and pointing also away from the author & monologues'
themselves towards an expanding area of questions=2C of ways of writing=2C
of thinking=2C of encouraging DIY (do-it-yourself) in an
inspirational/exemplary manner???--

please note i am not trying
to start an argument(s) but hoping to open the questions and
observations up=2C towo/ards more questions and areas--re the topics--

isn't
perhaps Silliman's blog also a form of "confessional writing?"--as with
much contemporary avant writing=2C so often concerned with the
"confessional" aspect of writing re one's memories=2C life=2C jobs=2C

behaviors=2C thoughts=2C attitudes=2C emotions since 9/11???"--

to restrict the blog writings to "literary thoughts?"--as these are
bound up with the personal=2C the subjective=2C "the 'I'"--?? with ethical

Um, I don't think that's what RS meant by "dramatic monologue." The term has a specific sense in poetry, associated primarily with Robert Browning. It has nothing to do with literal monologues in stage dramas like Beckett's.

I think of Silliman's work all the time, and have even bothered to learn to spell his name.

Dear Friends,

It is with great sadness that we share the news of the passing of our
friend, colleague, and East Village neighbor David Nolan. David suffered
from a heart attack last Thursday, February 25. He had just turned 47 on
Valentine=B9s Day.=20

David has been involved with the Poetry Project for many years as our much
cherished audio-technical consultant. He worked with John Fisk, and as
recently as this past New Year=B9s Day, with David Vogen. Many of you probabl=
y
noticed him assisting at the sound table for twelve hours straight,
photographing each performer and live-posting portraits to his Facebook pag=
e
throughout the event!

David was a friend to many people in our community, and his wife, Joy
Linscheid, would like to extend an invitation to his memorial service to
anyone who has known him over the years.

The funeral will be held on Wednesday, March 3, here at St. Mark=B9s Church
(131 E. 10th St. at 2nd Ave). The service will run from 4PM to 5:30PM. A
reception will follow in the Parish Hall from 5:30PM to 7PM.

David worked with a number of community and arts organizations during his
life; in lieu of flowers his family would appreciate that donations be made
in David=B9s name to one of the charities listed below, or to one of your
choosing.

Our deepest condolences go out to David=B9s family and friends.

Love,

The Poetry Project

Political scientist, Ashok Karra, continues to support poetry (something he doesn't write) by putting his thoughts out there about specific poems (for his mostly non-poetry-reading audience!) -- pretty daring if you ask someone who rarely critiques poetry (me!).

If you feel so moved, please visit and even post a note on his latest response to my poem, "State of a Nation" - thanks in advance!

I don't know if I sent this here, but I sent it to a women's poetry listserv and have now second guessed myself:  why shouldn't I send it to an "everyone" listserv?

Disappointments (BlazeVOX).

Thanks, everyone, for making this project a success. To see former titles

Chirot's post was dead on.

Um, I don't think that's what RS meant by "dramatic monologue." The term has a specific sense in poetry, associated primarily with Robert Browning. It has nothing to do with literal monologues in stage dramas like Beckett's.

I think of Silliman's work all the time, and have even bothered to learn to spell his name.

Marsh Hawk Press (New York) has teamed up with Meritage Press (San Francisc=
o
& St. Helena) to provide a poetry fundraiser for Haiti Relief.

Those who order five or more "Hay(na)ku for Haiti" booklets from Meritage
Press' Open Palm Press will also receive a complimentary copy of Eileen
R. Tabios' latest Marsh Hawk Press book, *THE THORN ROSARY: Selected Prose
Poems & New*, edited by Thomas Fink (more information about *THE THORN
ROSARY* at http://marshhawkpress.org/tabios4.htm ).

As five booklets are available for $15 and Ms. Tabios' book retails for
$19.95, we hope poetry lovers will find this offer an attractive way to
contribute to Haiti relief. The following provides details on this Haiti
fundraiser:

*Open Palm Press*
*(an imprint of Meritage Press)*
*is pleased to announce the series:*
**
*Hay(na)ku for Haiti*

-- a fundraiser for Haiti, edited by Eileen R. Tabios and blessed by suppor=
t
from chapbookpublisher.com.

Poets who write in the hay(na)ku form (about which more information is
available at http://haynakupoetry.blogspot.com) have consented to create
hay(na)ku for helping Haiti's recovery efforts. The results are to be
released as "pocket poem booklets" by Open Palm Press. Each will be sold fo=
r
$3.00, reflecting the hay(na)ku's three lines, with all proceeds to be
donated for Haiti relief.

The first eight of the series are:

#1: *PARTICLE AND WAVE and FROM THE CHAIR*, two hay(na)ku sequences by Jean
Vengua
#2: *On A Pyre: An Ars Poetica* by Eileen R. Tabios
#3: *Hay(na)ku for Haiti* by Tom Beckett
#4: *when the earth moves* by Lars Palm
#5: *After Ren=E9 Depestre=92s =93My Definition of Poetry=94, as translated=
 by
Edwidge Danticat, with lines at the end by Lafcadio Hearn* by John
Bloomberg-Rissman
 #6: *Mrs. Quake* by Nicole Mauro
#7: *Through Having Been, Vol. 1* by William Allegrezza
#8: *Through Having Been, Vol. 2* by William Allegrezza

Over time, more releases will occur as it is anticipated that Haiti's relie=
f
requirements will be prolonged and deep. Poets interested in exploring the
hay(na)ku through this fundraising effort may contact the series editor at
MeritagePress@aol.com

"H for H" booklets are lovingly produced by chapbookpublisher.com (

To all who knew David Nolan,

This is indeed shocking news.David was one of a kind, a gentle man who had not a vindictive bone in his body. As a friend for nearly 30 years, I will miss him as a brother. Rest in peace Dave, may you bump into Jerry up there, and sing the Morning Dew together.

Goodbye, dear friend.

Subject: Service for David Nolan

Dear Friends,

It is with great sadness that we share the news of the passing of our
friend, colleague, and East Village neighbor David Nolan. David suffered
from a heart attack last Thursday, February 25. He had just turned 47 on
Valentine=B9s Day.=20

David has been involved with the Poetry Project for many years as our much
cherished audio-technical consultant. He worked with John Fisk, and as
recently as this past New Year=B9s Day, with David Vogen. Many of you probabl=
y
noticed him assisting at the sound table for twelve hours straight,
photographing each performer and live-posting portraits to his Facebook pag=
e
throughout the event!

David was a friend to many people in our community, and his wife, Joy
Linscheid, would like to extend an invitation to his memorial service to
anyone who has known him over the years.

The funeral will be held on Wednesday, March 3, here at St. Mark=B9s Church
(131 E. 10th St. at 2nd Ave). The service will run from 4PM to 5:30PM. A
reception will follow in the Parish Hall from 5:30PM to 7PM.

David worked with a number of community and arts organizations during his
life; in lieu of flowers his family would appreciate that donations be made
in David=B9s name to one of the charities listed below, or to one of your
choosing.

Our deepest condolences go out to David=B9s family and friends.

Love,

The Poetry Project

*Genji Monogatari* is a sequence of 54 poems, each keyed to one of the
chapters of the 11th century Japanese classic by Murasaki Shikibu. The
result is a complex and beautiful palimpsest, wherein we are privileged,
simultaneously and sequentially, to look upon worlds within worlds within
worlds. Mark Young opens the book on the processes of the composition of th=
e
sequence itself so that, along with his reading of *The Tale of Genji*, we
are also given the progress of the writing of that reading. His technique,
foregrounded here, demonstrates a fidelity to stochastics allied with a
profound knowledge of, and respect for, tradition: *replaying** / **our
cached millennium**.* All the characteristics of Young=92s recent

s
if, in the drawing back of screen after screen after screen, what is
revealed is the nakedness of all enclosure, the silence inside both world
and word.*=97**Martin Edmond*



*Genji Monogatari* will be launched by Michele Leggott in Auckland, New
Zealand, on 31 March, at the Home & Away
Symposium<http://www.nzepc.auckland.ac.nz/features/home&away/index.asp>orga=

Dear all,


"AlphaAlpha, an animated netbook of letters"

I am glad to say that it is ready at: http://arteonline.arq.br/a/ .

The concept of this netbook is the proper "history of writing, which is, in
a way, the history of the human race, since in it are bound up, severally
and together, the development of thought, of expression, of art, of
intercommunication, and of mechanical invention."

"AlphaAlpha" is composed of 365 instances of the letter "A" plus one more
for the leap year. The letters are collected in groups of about ten.
"AlphaAlpha" is a collaborative work and includes participants =E2=94=80 ar=
tists &
poets =E2=94=80 from several places around the world. "AlphaAlpha" is a goo=
d example
of the possibilities of net art.

 Very cool, Tod!  Please let me know what you think, if you have time!

I think we're going to get a showing of it up here too.  That is, we're going to try to get one...  as anyone in any town can attempt - ask your local art gallery or school.

Best,
Amy

I don't know if I sent this here, but I sent it to a women's poetry listserv and have now second guessed myself:  why shouldn't I send it to an "everyone" listserv?

Looks great --- take a gander at the short trailer here - http://www.whodoesshethinksheis.net/

So I commissioned a female artist not long ago to make some dolls of my partner-in-crime, Ana, and myself.  I can't tell you how thrilled I was when they arrived today -- so much so that I posted a note and photos here --http://amyking.wordpress.com/2010/03/04/strange-dolls/

But this got me to thinking, especially in relation to the film, "Who Does She Think She Is?" (http://www.whodoesshethinksheis.net/) -- how many of us are ever commissioned to sell our own art?  How often do we support artists who are making a go of doing such?  Is it possible to write poems for pay?  Is there a way to start a trend, especially in the face of current economic climate, that gets back to supporting the little artist toiling away at her craft?  Are you one of those artists who would be willing to give it a whirl?

I realize this raises a whole host of loaded issues (i.e. can creativity be prompted by pay?  Can a poet actually sell poems? Is this a call to pull your dusty mimeograph and letterpress machines from the attics and basements?), but I ask after finding out a poet I know has done as much, and he's something of a name... and I'd like to open a discussion about such the business of making a life as an artist in this country. Or are we all just supplementing our lives with side art / "hobbies"?

Best,

Amy

I feel this is quite a good article on digital poetry: "Digital Duende:
Reading the Rasp in E-Poetry" by Amanda G. Michaels (
http://www.shiftjournal.org/articles/2009/michaels.htm ). She explains Lorca's
use of the term duende, concerning art, in his lecture "Play and Theory of
the Duende".  And moves on to look at work by Ken Goldsmith, Craig Dworkin,
Simon Biggs, Mez, Alan Sondheim, and myself in relation to duende. And she
discusses critical writing by Chris Funkhouser, Nathaniel Mackey, Michael
Davidson, and Landow.

I have two new appearances of work in magazines (online and off) that =
may be of interest to some here:
=20

(1) All of the translation-derived versions of Navajo horse-songs (five =
in all) in the current issue of Bombay Gin out of Naropa.  These have =
never appeared together except in an artist's version back in the 1970s =
and are presented here, along with my "total translation" essay, through =
the good offices of Andrew Schelling and Amy Catanzano. =20

(Copies can be ordered by checking their web site: =
http://www.naropa.edu/bombaygin/about.cfm)

=20

(2) A new interview conducted by Mark Weiss and presently posted on =
Aryanil Mukherjee's Kaurab magazine =
(http://www.kaurab.com/english/interviews/rothenberg.html).  This gives =
me a particular chance to speak for an international school of poetry =
and poetics, plus some other things.

Hi folks;

my most recent book of visual poetry - CHAINS - is nearing the end of =
its print run, so if you are at all interested in picking up a copy, i =
recommend scooping it up relatively soon...

92 pages of visual poetry. $15 + postage.=20

http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9780979847035/chains.aspx?rf=3D1

**

With CHAINS, derek beaulieu once again turns his attention to how =
"language regards itself, stalks itself, begins, slowly, to eat itself" =
(Canadian Literature) in a series of graceful abstractions made entirely =
from antiquated dry-transfer lettering. In chains, letters gather in =
elegant arrangements, architectural constructions and sinews of meaning. =
derek beaulieu is the author of 8 books of poetry and conceptual =
writing. In 2005 he co-authored, with Gary Barwin, fragments from the =
frag pool: haiku after basho, a book of playful translations. In 2006 he =
co-edited Shift & Switch: new Canadian poetry to wide acclaim. Alberta =
Views recently referred to beaulieu as a "mad scientist of visual =
poetry", and FFWD referred to his 2006 volume fractal economies as =
having "the potential to be like Miles Davis' Kind of Blue, which taps =
the veins of jazz for many listeners and musicians. Never read a book of =
concrete poetry before? This might be the one to hook you."

Flarf, the American long poem and native Hawaiian poetry, rhyme in
Paul Muldoon and textual variability in New Media poetry, Susan Howe
and Lucinda Roy, jazz and Asian American poetics, and much more.
Featuring Marilyn Hacker, Patricia Smith, Tyler Hoffman, and Stefania
deKenessey. Presented by the Center for the Humanities and the GC
Poetics Group. Moderated by Corey Frost.

I've done this at a punk-rock flea market. A member of the local
roller-derby team was one of my patrons; while "My Wheels, Your Ass" will
never rank among my finest contributions to litrachoor, it got me a little
money and a big hug from the roller diva. And, of course, a silly story to
tell.

Recently I've noticed some advertisements that appear to be in poem-y
format.

For example:

http://www.qf.org.qa/think/Think.pdf

And it's pretty kind of good!

Maybe the way to get commissioned to write poems is to think about things
they could be *used* for.  Though I'm aware this idea of use is maybe taboo
or incompatible with our for-its-own-sake mentality.

If for-its-own-sake is what poetry is, then it's not commissionable.

If for-a-commission is what we would like it to be, then we must think in
terms of identifying, inspiring, and inventing market demand.

Lars,

You are my hero!

Amy, I remember when I was a kid in SFR Yugoslavia, poets (bad, of
course, but not only poets, writers of all kinds) would tour schools
and community centers all over the country, read, sell and sign books,
and I believe they were getting paid for that either by their
state-owned publisher or some state agency. Then they'd get drunk at
the local "bohemian" bar/restaurant with the provincial amateur
literati, sleep in some dingy hotel room, and then hit the road again
in the morning. Or they wouldn't get drunk, that depends.

Also growing up, I saw all kinds of grave commemorations of the
anti-fascist struggle and workers revolution in Yugoslavia that
regularly featured poems written especially for the occasion, and read
by famous actors. It was always televised. But I'm talking about
ancient history in a non-existent land, maybe I'm just weaving a myth
out of my unreliable memories. Go figure!

But poets in the US even nowadays get commissioned to write occasional
poems, don't they? Not just Elizabeth Alexander. Although I don't know
if they get paid for it. I remember (and this is not a myth) when a
new chancellor was inaugurated at UNC Wilmington in the early 2000s,
they commissioned a poem by a UNC Greensboro professor of creative
writing. He read an ode that heavily utilized various words that
end-rhyme with WilmINGTON. You'd be surprised how many words he came
up with. I attended the inauguration because my role was to walk with
other international students, each one of us carrying a flag of a
foreign country to show off how cosmopolitan the school was.

I think there is a very long history of artists working on commission-- and=
 making great art.=A0 This is certainly true for visual arts and music, why=
 not for poetry?=A0 I think the only danger would be if a writer doesn't do=
 any writing at all outside the commission/ pay format.=A0 But to a large e=
xtent we want people to read and appreciate our work, it is why we try to p=
ublish, so why not have some of that appreciation be in the form of pay.=A0=
 "I like your poetry, can you write more for me and I will pay you?"=A0 I'd=
 love that-- especially if there were few or no strings attached...

So I commissioned a female artist not long ago to make some dolls of my par=
tner-in-crime, Ana, and myself.=A0 I can't tell you how thrilled I was when=
 they arrived today -- so much so that I posted a note and photos here --ht=
tp://amyking.wordpress.com/2010/03/04/strange-dolls/

But this got me to thinking, especially in relation to the film, "Who Does =
She Think She Is?" (http://www.whodoesshethinksheis.net/) -- how many of us=
 are ever commissioned to sell our own art?=A0 How often do we support arti=
sts who are making a go of doing such?=A0 Is it possible to write poems for=
 pay?=A0 Is there a way to start a trend, especially in the face of current=
 economic climate, that gets back to supporting the little artist toiling a=
way at her craft?=A0 Are you one of those artists who would be willing to g=
ive it a whirl?

I realize this raises a whole host of loaded issues (i.e. can creativity be=
 prompted by pay?=A0 Can a poet actually sell poems? Is this a call to pull=
 your dusty mimeograph and letterpress machines from the attics and basemen=
ts?), but I ask after finding out a poet I know has done as much, and he's =
something of a name... and I'd like to open a discussion about such the bus=
iness of making a life as an artist in this country. Or are we all just sup=
plementing our lives with side art / "hobbies"?

Best,

Amy

enormous accomplishment that is officially unveiled on a freezing
Satur(n)/day here in the Alps and a  terribly hot day in Nigeria, with an

epileptic electricity supply that forces people to seek refuge under the
trees outside:

brings us a gut-punch orb of truth where only the names have been
changed, though the innocent remain unprotected. An excerpt:

*Poppycock*

Leave your common sense
outside the door
do not speculate
what I say is not evidence
the judge will instruct you on the law
when I shout at the murder victim's mother
do not hold it against me
or take it out on my client sitting here
in prison pallor, gray suit and tie
so you will not know he is in custody
I am only doing my job
even a dead child’s mother can lie
wouldn't you agree and her lies
could put my client behind bars
his freedom is at stake his innocence
so important I will tell you what to think
which facts you should ignore
do not speculate I say
leave your common sense
outside the door

Point system

We are all the same is the moral of the story.
All men are the same is the moral of the story,
but it is not good news. Strangers should never
be encouraged is the moral of the story. Lose

and forfeit your job is the moral of the story.
Come off hard is the moral of the story.
The wolf lives and probably will get you
is the moral of the story. Resistance
is justified is the moral of the story.

Your but Google is the moral of the story
is the complete opposite of the truth. Think
before you act is the moral of the story. The last
line of the play is, The moral of the story isnt
get along; its get to know your neighbor.

A polite note of warning to those rushing off to the China: Bookworm =
International Literary Festival. Jacket magazine has been banned in =
China for a decade. If you're discussing poetry in public or in private, =
it might be best not to bring up Jacket as a topic: something harmless =
like macrame, gardening or finger-painting would be a safer choice.=20

Oh, and don't admit you have HIV/AIDS if you have HIV/AIDS; Australian =
writer Robert Dessaix was denied a visa last week after he had admitted =
on his visa applicaiton form that he had HIV/AIDS.=20

Yours democratically,=20

I hate to admit that this situation was perceived, at least by myself & the=
 male poets I knew, as =E2=80=9Cnormal=E2=80=9D back in the 1960s, but it w=
as...=0A=0A=0ASo that when Kathleen Fraser =E2=80=93 that name again =E2=80=
=93 joined with some like-minded friends in 1983 to create HOW(ever), the t=
iming was perfect: it proved to be an epoch-making event...=0A=0A=0AStill, =
nothing has done more to change =E2=80=93 blur, to some degree even erase =
=E2=80=93 the faultlines for poetry in my lifetime than the mass emergence =
of women writing. For all of the problems that I have with the concept of h=
ybridity in poetry, I can=E2=80=99t escape the fact that for many writers, =
especially those younger than myself, the bifurcation of poetry into two co=
unter-posing traditions is experienced as a quarrel among men (white men at=
 that), and that the landscape of poetry in the English language now looks =
entirely different.=0A=0ANot that all is perfect. Far from it. It is still =
possible to have a major award shortlist that consists entirely of men, eve=
n though everyone now seems to concede that the absolute majority of poets =
writing in English are women. Further, this disparity continues to turn up =
in some of the ways women writers express themselves. Of the 1192 active bl=
ogs on my blogroll, 392 are written by women, slightly under 33 percent. Fo=
r the next week, the top list on my new links page will consist of nothing =
but these women (and, knowing Blogger, that may be the only list visible). =
Now, it=E2=80=99s conceivable that one of the reasons for this disparity is=
 me =E2=80=93 if I=E2=80=99m missing anyone, send me an email and let me kn=
ow. It=E2=80=99s also true that not all of the collective blogs are exclusi=
vely by men =E2=80=93 Give a Fig missed this list because one of its 13 con=
tributors is male. But the distance between the 25 percent figure that mark=
ed the participation by women in In the American
 Tree in 1986 and the 32.9 percent in my blogroll 24 years later is not the=
 sign of a successful revolution so much as it is of one still very much in=
 process.=0AWomen who blog about poetry, poetics & the arts=0A=0ACONT -- ht=

"As a context for sharing ideas, online resources, information, etc,
listserv is, nevertheless, immensely useful to its subscribers. It is a
context of education and consciousness-raising. A listserv that has specific
professional commitments helps its members in their professional development
a great deal and thus becomes indispensable as the imagined place to meet
with those who know "the way."

These days that education in a country like Nigeria is in great travail,
having access to the Internet and subscribing to a listserv where sound
professional sharing goes on could be one way of maintaining one's
intellectual wellbeing. Everyday one reads listserv postings and the
resources shared, one has truly answered "present" in a classroom with
little or no tuition paid."

I'm always disappointed by these "buck-a-poem" projects. Is poetry
worthless? Does it not require time, dedication, hours, days, weeks? I will
write anybody a poem for $1000.

Yes, I often wonder how many poets go into advertising.  And if that gig takes the poetry out of people...

As for the latter bit on "for-a-commission" - is that even possible?  Seems like there is something of that market, or the seeds of it, via those contests.  Maybe.

 Recently I've noticed some advertisements that appear to be in poem-y
format.

For example:

http://www.qf.org.qa/think/Think.pdf

And it's pretty kind of good!

Maybe the way to get commissioned to write poems is to think about things
they could be *used* for.  Though I'm aware this idea of use is maybe taboo
or incompatible with our for-its-own-sake mentality.

If for-its-own-sake is what poetry is, then it's not commissionable.

If for-a-commission is what we would like it to be, then we must think in
terms of identifying, inspiring, and inventing market demand.

I just got into this conversation...one of my master's thesis was on advert=
ising and poetry. I was looking at very old ads from the Lady's Home Journa=
l. Some of the language was quite interesting, and well, poetic. I do think=
, though, that a poet would become quite ill writing copy for advertisments=
. I also wrote copy for radio ads and that was very boring. I do remember h=
aving to figure out how to get as many words into a 30 or 60 second ad.

Amy,

So true about AWP "bohemian" poets. The world and its poets are the
same everywhere, the differences are cosmetic.

Ex- or post-Yugo poets wrote a lot about the war while it was going
on, as well as before it started, from all points of view and with all
possible agendas. Fucking Radovan Karad=C5=BEi=C4=87 was a published bad po=
et
before he became a warlord. (At a Democratic Party Christmas reception
in Richmond, VA, in the early 2000s, some drunken democrat told me,
upon learning that I was from Croatia and that I was a poet, "You
know, Karad=C5=BEi=C4=87 was also a poet." I should have retorted, "You kno=
w,
Hitler was also a politician." Too bad my comebacks are perennially
late, so I get to play them only in my head. In my head, the drunken
democrat's jaw hits the floor and I triumphantly walk away.)

Dubravka =C4=90uri=C4=87 is on this Poetics list (ciao!), she wrote awesome
anti-war poems. Just check out Dubravka:
http://writing.upenn.edu/library/Djuric-Dubravka_poems.html

Generally speaking (and as Dubravka's poems attest), you write against
the war and oppression, but you want the poems to apply not just to
today's news, but to a larger context, right? Just like nowadays in
the US with the current wars. I love (ciao!) Juliana Spahr's "This
Connection of Everyone with Lungs," that's a long anti-war poem, among
other things. Also, a genius poet like Rosmarie Waldrop (ciao!) can
write something more obvious and still kick ass, like the poem in
"Love, Like Pronouns," the last poem in the book, I believe. (I don't
have the book here with me, I'm visiting in Croatia, otherwise I'd
look up the title.)

As for post-Yugo poets getting commissioned nowadays, maybe Dubravka
will know? I left the Balkans a long time ago and I know less and less
about the area.

BTW, in 1990s, Dubravka would "commission" poems and essays from my
poet friends and me, but if we brought some texts she liked, she
wouldn't pay us with money, only with her friendship and a publication
in ProFemina etc. Haha.

as ever
adz aver

I don't know. Advertising might not be so soul-killing, at least in =
comparison to many other careers.

What about writing, again and again, "quotations of four or more lines =
should be indented one inch from the left margin" -- or the equivalent?

Both advertising and teaching are in their own way attempts to =
interpolate the subject into a society, to make them fit for it, fit =
into it. Both can be drudgery, and both can be creative, inspiring and =
inspired. I'm assuming there are some institutions worth an effort to =
write ad copy for them.

(I wonder if the person who came up with "Change" got paid by the word?)

The Economy of the Unlost by Anne Carson offers an interesting take on =
the idea of patronage. She suggests that poetry does have a social role =
that should be reimbursed. And that its role is, as Stephen Ellis =
suggested, apocalyptic, preserving what is by proposing its extinction. =
(Of course that "what is" is polemic; you can imagine that the act of =
being-for-itself is an apocalyptic gesture aimed at revealing the atomic =
structure of society.)

But now I must get back to grading.

Yes, but the Raid company offered him a boatload of money to appropriate the poem the phrase appeared in; he was later accused of selling out...

Teaching the MLA format is quite frustrating and exhausting, also. I think =
that I would rather do that than write copy, though. I don't think that I w=
ould have the heart to write poetry in my spare time if worked in advertisi=
ng.=20

I don't know. Advertising might not be so soul-killing, at least in compari=
son to many other careers.

What about writing, again and again, "quotations of four or more lines shou=
ld be indented one inch from the left margin" -- or the equivalent?

Both advertising and teaching are in their own way attempts to interpolate =
the subject into a society, to make them fit for it, fit into it. Both can =
be drudgery, and both can be creative, inspiring and inspired. I'm assuming=
 there are some institutions worth an effort to write ad copy for them.

(I wonder if the person who came up with "Change" got paid by the word?)

The Economy of the Unlost by Anne Carson offers an interesting take on the =
idea of patronage. She suggests that poetry does have a social role that sh=
ould be reimbursed. And that its role is, as Stephen Ellis suggested, apoca=
lyptic, preserving what is by proposing its extinction. (Of course that "wh=
at is" is polemic; you can imagine that the act of being-for-itself is an a=
pocalyptic gesture aimed at revealing the atomic structure of society.)

But now I must get back to grading.

Adeena Karasick is a poet, media-artist and the award-winning author of sev=

The Empress Has No Closure (Talonbooks, 1992). Marked with an urban, Jewish=
, feminist aesthetic that continually challenges normative modes of meaning=
 production, and engaged with the art of combination and turbulence of thou=
ght, her work is a testament to the creative and regenerative power of lang=
uage and its infinite possibilities for pushing meaning to the limits of it=
s semantic boundaries. Karasick has lectured and performed worldwide and re=
gularly publishes articles, reviews and dialogues on contemporary poetry, p=
oetics and cultural/semiotic theory. She is Professor of Global Literature =

So true.

I've never worked in advertising, but I've seen some old ads by Ranjan
Adiga, a fiction writer now, and those were very inspired. He
explained to me that people creating ads get to come up with a lot of
very creative campaigns that never get picked up. There are
conferences and awards out there given to those phantom, but super
creative campaigns. I wish Ranjan was on this list to tell us more
about that. But basically, an ad team may come up with a brilliant
campaign for, say, laundry soap, they'll come up with clever words and
and unexpected visuals, they'll win awards, but then that campaign
would never actually get used by the soap company, because everyone
knows that the only people who do laundry are wholesome, cute,
preferably blond and blue-eyed, middle-class mothers of
shenanigans-prone small brats. And so on.

Taking a page from David Hilbert's well-known list of 23 "Paris =
Problems" (1900), and, likewise,=20

Beyond the issue of what constitutes genre, canon, and "best," not to
mention "current" or "poet": there is also the question of judgment.
Is a poem written to be judged, any more than an experience is judged?
How does one judge anything that has no possibility either of quantifiable
results or verification procedures (not to mention falsifiability)?
How would you compare a contemporary poet to the poetry of Sumer?
One might think immediately that the habitus of each is fundamentally
unknowable to that of the other.
The same might be true, say, of Swinburne and Sondheim.
What about Sondheim and Damon? Does the synchronic necessarily lend itself
to judgment and comparison?
On the other hand, let's say that judgment has a pragmatics: of grant,
job, publication. Then judgment also implies an ecology and competition:
writing is now a contestation, which implies as well a curlicue or
diacritical marking beyond the ostensible 'content' of the text, no matter
how defined. In other words: Here is my poem; rate it; act accordingly.
The poem is now a function.
It's a function within a potentially limited space-time event or attention
economy.
There is nothing right or wrong with this approach, either.
Nor of the other approach.
It becomes a matter of taste, connoisseurship: Of who is judging, and who
is being judged. And, like pretty much anything in poetry/poetics, this is
also something that's basically - i.e. ontologically, epistemologically,
unanswerable, because the question, just like the "Should" in the question
above, is problematic, self-deconstructing upon closer examination.

Jon Cotner and Andy Fitch are the authors of Ten Walks/Two Talks (Ugly
Duckling Presse, 2010). In 2009 they co-edited Interdisciplinary
Transcriptions -- a 1,036-page digital anthology containing poets, critics,
anthropologists and visual artists. Other publications include 1913,
Brooklyn Rail, Denver Quarterly, Electric Literature, Hotel Amerika, LIT and
UbuWeb. Cotner and Fitch have performed their dialogic improvisations at
festivals and conferences across the United States, as well as in Toronto
and Berlin. Cotner lives in New York City, where he is completing his Ph.D.
for SUNY Buffalo's Poetics Program. Fitch is an assistant professor in the
University of Wyoming's MFA Program.

John Harkey, hailing from Georgia but currently living cozily in Sunnyside,
Queens, is a PhD student at the CUNY Graduate Center. His dissertation, on
"small poems" (small, not short, nota bene), devotes itself principally to
Lorine Niedecker, George Oppen, Susan Howe, and the philosophy of Charles S.
Peirce. Some of John's own small poems have appeared in EOAGH and The
Solitary Plover, and he recently started Creature Press, a vehicle for
hand-made chapbooks. He begs your pardon and thanks you, in advance, for
your kind attentions, when- and wherever you may have occasion to bestow
them.

POET PIRATE NETBOT
Ruminations on the Undertaking of Excess Information
by Kedrick James
http://vispo.com/guests/kedrick/poetpiratebot

An essay by the Vancouver poet, musician, scholar, and visual artist Kedrick
James. With 13 of his intriguing visual collages (click these for bigger
versions).

Kedrick finished his doctorate last year. It is one of the few readable and
interesting doctoral dissertations I've encountered. It's titled "Writing
Post-Person: Poetics, Literacy and Sustainability in the Age of Disposable
Discourse". One of the things he looked at was spam as a literary
phenomenon. In POET PIRATE NETBOT, he looks at that and related things: how
writing and education are and will continue to change in light of the
geometricly increasing avalanches of writing and media occassioned by the
net and the digital, not just by the wide access the world's population has
to publishing tools, but by the presence of bots that write.

It's quite a hopeful look, really, at what sometimes appears to be a
devastating change to the literary, artistic, and educational landscapes.
For although we see this continuing avalanche of writing and media changing
the literary landscape, we also see people using the tools and bots to both
sift through the deluge and create works of art that begin to sort through
what we have.

The visual images in the essay relate to this topic via their being made
from google image search images (they're not made with dbCinema).

There's more work on vispo.com by Kedrick :
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kedrick is something I did in dbCinema on
Kedrick's thesis "Writing Post-Person: Poetics, Literacy and Sustainability
in the Age of Disposable Discourse".

Kedrick teaches English teachers at the University of British Columbia in
Vancouver.

Your world is based on mutual relief at your common corruption. Maybe some cultures
are based on even worse. But that wouldn't change the bad faith of it and as years
go by, you wake at night in terror of your whole life being an act of bad faith,
where everything is self-interest and nothing more, where every human interaction is
driven by a silent, even subconscious calculation of some ulterior motive, to the
point that a sea of bad faith has taken over your whole life, there's no small
island left from which you can even try to build a bridge of good faith, because
even that effort becomes suspect, even good faith is nothing but self-interested,
even altruism is nothing but solipsistic, even your professed agonizing right here
right now is nothing but a gesture, made to the conscience in order to assure it
that it exists.

Thank you for your posting Setphen--this is indeed a very stunning and
fascinating journal--i sure hope to contribute to a future issue from just
reading many of the pieces inside--

Something that has always struck me in the designation of your works and
that of others as "haptic" is that itis not the haptic at al that one is
writing of nor seeing, looking at, but the "touching"--that is the touching
as in the sentimental, the recording of sentiments, rather than the actual
physical touching, which is what the haptic really is. There is even a
formof engineering now devoted to creating "haptic robots," which are able
to discern the differences in touch between various textures which the robo=
t
is directed to touch and compare--to indicate that it does have a sense of
touch developed enough to "feel the difference" between the different
textures.

I find that in discussing these differences between the actual haptic act o=
f
the touch and the removed, distanced, as it were "narratives and
sentimentalized" 'touching" response is that one is encountering a kind of
gulf, a chasm, between what is considered being literally in touch with the
world and one in which an experience in which an after the fact recording o=
f
a preconceived set of sensations as a form of =93record=94 do not as it wer=
e
=93touch.=94

Instead, there is a kind of gulf, a chasm, and it often gives me to wonder
what it is that one might sense this.  Perhaps a bit further on here I may
express a few thoughts which have occurred to one through time--
Mind you, I do not mean this as a kind of put down of the kinds of works
Stephen and other=92s do, not at all, and especially not of dear friend men=
tor
Bob Cobbing=92s =93allegorical haptic,=94 --what i find instead is a form o=
f field
of investigation into the meaning of what it is to touch and "to be touched=
"
("move") in encountering the visual records which are those of  the
encounter with the materials.

What I mean is a difference between actual direct physical touching and the
emotionally =93touching,=94 the recording of =93sensations=94 of the mental=
 and
visual variety.  Which is also not the same as the putting down on canvas  =
of
 =93mes petites sensations devant la Nature=94 as Cezanne wrote of his work=
s.
(=93My little sensations before/in facing Nature.=94)


     A person wrote of my rubBeings that they proved that what Nerval calle=
d
the impossibility of the ground itself speaking was made suddenly not
impossible, for in these works it is the ground itself which is speaking,
emerging in its own notations on the page, rather than an imposition of my
own views on the nature of the ground or myself either one of us =93speakin=
g."


     It is perhaps the difference between direct physical contact with an
"Outside," and the "sentimentalized" (sentiment in the sense of feelings
rather than feeling as in touch--) experience of "the touching" as recorded
via techniques which present the "image of a feeling" rather than the direc=
t
imprint of the touching of the materials with the hand. In the "sentimental=
"
case, one has a sense of the evacuation of the actual in favor of the
re-construction of a set of detached images which "stand in" for an
experience which occurs "after the fact" in the form of a narrative of an
abstraction.

      For I do not think that it is an =93I=94 that speaks at al but someth=
ing
greater made out of the touching of the crayon and hand on one side of the
paper and that of the materials on the other side, thus creating what
Burroughs and Gysin called  their works together, =93The Third Mind.=94 And=
 that
Third Mind indeed is a ground speaking, an actual =93material language=94 o=
f
texture, color, dirt, noise and song which emrge into a dance choreographed
by the forms, while the hoise which rises into music is that of the singing
of the lines of the matruial as it merges with that of the rubBEing and so=
=97I
touch the line and it sings--
      Paul Celan wrote that "Poetry no longer impose itself, it exposes
itself."  Yet one still finds that in a poetry of the touching, one is
imposing as it were a sensation from within one=92s self onto a material wh=
ich
itself remains distanced, and doubly distanced in that its recording is not
done directly but by the indirect means of the exposures the camera and
distanced again by being formed into a series which did not exist as itself=
.

There is also involved here the discussions around what it is to have, to
find, to make an "impersonal poetry." this tends to be done in this culture
via machines as that is the association which is most often made in
conjunction with an image of the "impersonal."  The impersonal may also be
thought of in relation with copying, with "non-originality," yet again the
impersonality is simply the donning of another's mask and voice rather than
using one's own.  It is simply a substitution of subjectivities which is at
work, and belongs to drama--I find it at least much more to the field of
performance than to that of an impersonality.
Is there then impersonality in the rubBEings?  One hopes that as much as
possible that is not such but more the personality of the materials
themselves which is being expressed via the imprinting of itself done by as
"primitive=92s possible method--that ancient one of the rubBEing.
What one hope is being conveyed is the taphonomic presence of the
objet--that is the thing s as they exist in their current state, which is
one that registers what may ion man ways be the most impersonal of al
presences--that of Time.

By this I mean that as I work I am conscious of the exact Time which is
existing in and as the work=97the directions of the wind, the degree of hea=
t
or cold, the humidity or dryness, the materials around one which include
dust and leaf mold, dirt and tar, car exhaust and cigarette smoke, the
passing scents of perfumed young women or the sweating forms of runners and
so on.  At every instant al of these things are in flux, changing, in large
ways and small and it is al of these thing which are going into the making
of the piece itself whose surfaces are registering themselves the heat the
wetness the movements the air the thicknesses of smoke or scents of blood o=
r
decay or molds . . . al of the things are the markings of  Time, for with
each moments things are passing away, changing , their forms being worn
down, decaying crumbling, falling apart, the lettres becoming evermore
blurred or fragmented, the wood become every more rotten or hardened, the
air itself being evermore saturated with pollution=97so Time, that great
impersonal being which is passing, is expressing itself in the very fibers
of the pieces, in the most tiny particles which have become ingrained as it
were in the woven interstices of the  paper, in  the woven grains of the
hands their lines, their broken and chipped bones, their smashed and
tenuously functioning nerve endings=97

And at the same time all of this disintegration is going on, there=92s the
creation of new forms out of the constellations made in the chaos collapses
of every instant passing things further into the distances of time thought
it is but millisecond away=97the past the future and the present which is a
presence passing=97so ephemeral and at the same having a quality of enduran=
ce,
an obdurate eternity as it were a stubborn refusal while at the same time
dancing the night away=97

Energy=97time is in this energy, time is the energy, time and light as they
affect the materials, the hands, the paper=97

This gives an enduring sense of life as a form at once of refusal and
acceptance of time=97

In a sense this is the impersonality which is expressed, this ongoing time
which is =93outside oneself=92 yet which one is =93inside of.=94 Oneself at=
 the same
time.  Similarly in the touch I feel that ongoing sense of al the hands tha=
t
have been the blood coursing through mine, Al those hands that have worked
with wood and bark and water and stone for three hundred fity years in Nort=
h
America, and longer=97before the blood was mixed into French and Indian=97s=
o
long the blood in the hands has been working with the things in these place=
s
that the hand itself is not one=92s own=97but simply a very active and
haptically engaged hand of centuries stil finding its way along grains of
wood and the time existing in waters and skies, in the stones and the
passing of shadows of the outstretched limbs of trees playing over the
cracks of the sidewalks which Bob Cobbing and I used to sound out as
notations for performance many years ago

In that sense al these things touching each other understand the transience
of their encounters, the speed=97which means the swiftnesses and slownesses=
--
with which al this is passing-and at the same time the deep encounter withi=
n
the moment when the presences meet and make their signs together and pass
on=97

This does not mean an encounter with an identity but rather the passing awa=
y
of identity into something far greater than itself, something that is truly
outside and whose outside is also inside one, that continual sense of being
at once present and incredibly distant, from some other time and place and
al the while uncannily familiar yet always strangely here.
It is an encounter with that other which is oneself, some otherness
encountering the continual otherness of the things one lives among=97things=
 as
much known as any person and at the same time just as strange--

Tuesday, March 16, 2010. 6:30 pm. At the CUNY Graduate Center, 365
Fifth Avenue New York, Rm. 9206.
Multiformalisms : Postmodern Poetics of Form

Join poet and editor Annie Finch, along with contributors to the
anthology Multiformalisms: Postmodern Poetics of Form, for a lively
discussion of how contemporary poets use and understand forms. The
conversation, like the book, will juxtapose traditional formalism and
Flarf, the American long poem and native Hawaiian poetry, rhyme in
Paul Muldoon and textual variability in New Media poetry, Susan Howe
and Lucinda Roy, jazz and Asian American poetics, and much more.
Featuring Marilyn Hacker, Patricia Smith, Tyler Hoffman, Stefania
deKenessey, and Marie-Elizabeth Mali. Presented by the Center for the
Humanities and the GC Poetics Group. Moderated by Corey Frost.

A message from a daily lurker:

I'm writing to tell you that all California schools (K - Nobel folk) succeded in our March 4 Day of Action rally throughout the state (and a number nationally, as well) to support our demand for proper educational funding.

Thousands of us statewide participated in Walkouts and Rallies.  While considerable media coverage was of small highway sitins, most of us attended and conducted rallies at our various sites.

The next major California action takes place on March 22.  Buses from all over the state will be converging in Sacramento, our state capitol, and then marching to Mr. Schwarzenegger's door.

I'm asking you all to keep us in your thoughts that day.  (You might say that this is Poetry in Motion!)

Thanks for listening!

i sometimes pay street people $1 for a poem if they have a sign offering
that.
i was going to pay Bernadette Mayer for a poem for a conference a few
years ago (she had a standing offer out for topical poems for pay) but i
didn't get it together.
in 1977 i paid $2 for Allen Ginsberg to write a haiku for me for a
Naropa benefit. I wish i could find that haiku now. Because i was
standing with my friend Julia Sagebien, whom he knew, i know the phrase
"rosy dyke" was in it.

Beyond the issue of what constitutes genre, canon, and "best," not to=20
mention "current" or "poet": there is also the question of judgment.
Is a poem written to be judged, any more than an experience is judged?
How does one judge anything that has no possibility either of quantifiabl=
e=20
results or verification procedures (not to mention falsifiability)?
How would you compare a contemporary poet to the poetry of Sumer?
One might think immediately that the habitus of each is fundamentally=20
unknowable to that of the other.
The same might be true, say, of Swinburne and Sondheim.
What about Sondheim and Damon? Does the synchronic necessarily lend=20
itself=20
to judgment and comparison?
On the other hand, let's say that judgment has a pragmatics: of grant,=20=

job, publication. Then judgment also implies an ecology and competition:=20=

writing is now a contestation, which implies as well a curlicue or=20
diacritical marking beyond the ostensible 'content' of the text, no matte=
r=20
how defined. In other words: Here is my poem; rate it; act accordingly.
The poem is now a function.
It's a function within a potentially limited space-time event or attentio=
n=20
economy.
There is nothing right or wrong with this approach, either.
Nor of the other approach.
It becomes a matter of taste, connoisseurship: Of who is judging, and=20
who=20
is being judged. And, like pretty much anything in poetry/poetics, this i=
s=20
also something that's basically - i.e. ontologically, epistemologically,=20=

unanswerable, because the question, just like the "Should" in the=20
question=20
above, is problematic, self-deconstructing upon closer examination.

Dear Stephen--

when i first read Jerry's announcement on the Poetics List last September--=
that he is working on line on an
envisioned Anthology of Outsider Poetry--i also wondered--and do wonder
yet--what an Outsider Poetry might be=97



Does it mean a kind of extension into poetry of the examples drawn from
"Outsider Art?"--(some of the examples you use here are among those
used in the general ideas put forward as criteria for "Outsider Art")--is
it =93importing=94=97from another =93field=94-in a way that perhaps is like=
 that of the
Slow Food Movement being included into the Slow Poetry Movement--??)



Outsider in relation to what as "Inside?"--

How might the "Outside" Poet and Poetry mini-Anthology differ from Antholog=
ies like
the "Outlaw Bible of American Poetry" or--any number of anthologies
previously assembled by Jerry=2C George Quasha=2C Richard Alpert=2C Richard=
 Kostelanetz and many others?--Or any example of a collection of
"avant-garde" and "experimental" poetries?



Since Jerry has worked so long in so many areas of Poetry=2C i thought he m=
ight
have perhaps already some ideas as to his conceptions of what an Outsider P=
oetry
is--yet i have a feeling--this is just my own "intuition" really--i
have a feeling that part of what really sets this project apart is that the
nature of the Outside and Outsider may emerge in at least some guises and t=
hat
these will emerge as the projects moves along.  That to me is the really be=
autiful
part of the Anthology--that it is being assembled in "real time" and on
line--one may follow it as it develops--and=2C more than that=2C besides fi=
nding
examples which might function as "answers=2C" what one really finds=2C to
me at any rate=2C is the openness to a continual questioning and finding=2C=
 an
openness to the idea that this is not already a pre conceived set of exampl=
es=2C
prejudices=2C opinions=2C nor a trendy tip of the hat to any other movement=
s
etc--but truly is an ongoing investigation.



When Gertrude Stein=2C so the story goes=2C was on her dying bed--she looke=
d up at
whoever was present--and said--"What is the
answer?"--Then--laughing--she "answered" by saying--"What
is the question?"



I think the nature of this project=2C or the way i understand it and work w=
ith
it=2C is to keep asking questions--interesting & useful questions that as t=
hey emerge lead to further
question=2C findings=2C researches and the development of new methods=2C te=
chniques=2C
new conceptions=2C as well as the re-finding of older examples from around =
the
world which themselves ask questions which are just as alive today as when
first asked--



Questioning is something much absent in discussions of any kind today--what=
 is
really wanted=2C for the most part=2C are examples=2C descriptions=2C categ=
ories=2C
jargons=2C and ways to pigeon hole a poet or form of poetry.  This allows
for the creation of new anthologies=2C new job descriptions for candidates =
for
such and such a position=2C opens much needed vacancies in the employment w=

of today--To have the answers means also that a sense of "order" is
created=2C in order to fix with in the orders hierarchies=2C steps on the c=

4 hopeful pieces with descriptions

http://www.alansondheim.org/city.mp3
I've been thinking about the infinity of cities, the depth of soundscapes
and the romantic plenitude of nature. This is out the window of our loft;
every sound in the city contributes, every cough or whistle miles away,
every tire on asphalt. It always amazes me: this is the murmuring of a
technological world coming to an end, perhaps, within a century. There are
sub-bass harmonies here as well - harmonies which dominate the aural
landscape, but which are inaudible to human ears. Even in this recording,
one senses them. I've just finished Lamartine's uncanny Raphael, a book in
which the natural world of meadows and streams runs through emotional
states, tending towards both exaltation and cessation. I can imagine Julie
at walk among the Brooklyn forests of streets, still listening, but with a
greater hunger. HOPEFUL: The depth of the city revealed as a new cosmos
with everyone present, all the time.

http://www.alansondheim.org/melodeon.mp3
Recently acquired this 1847 melodeon thanks to book trading. The bellows
are bad; the vacuum box won't hold a vacuum; three valves are broken; the
vacuum box needs to be opened; several reeds won't sound. So it's in great
need of repair. In the meantime, furious pumping and a lot of reverb makes
this odd sound file; you can hear the bellows working. It's actually quite
a beautiful instrument, and will sound great once it's restored. HOPEFUL:
A melodeon sounding like it did in 1847, when it was in someone's parlor.

http://www.alansondheim.org/hybrid1.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/hybrid2.mp3
Playing around with the rishi on the oud, alternating with finger-picking.
It's difficult to keep the rishi (pick) available if I'm using everything
else on the strings. So it's rishi in the mouth, rishi on the floor, rishi
on the knee, rishi held sometimes with two fingers, with a curled finger,
with a thumb and finger, rishi sometimes dropped. On the other hand the
sonority of the two interacting playing modes really interests me.
HOPEFUL: Smooth transitions in-tune make for wonderful textures, melodies,
and harmonies.

HOPEFUL: The CITY SYMPHONY will make me rich; the MELODEON will bring
untold pleasure to millions; the HYBRID OUD PLAYING will set new standards
in improvisation world-wide.

David,

"One hopes that as much as
possible that is not such but more the personality of the materials
themselves which is being expressed via the imprinting of itself done by as
"primitive=92s possible method--that ancient one of the rubBEing."

What you are describing -both the nature of the escape from the ego and the
fusion of the subjective into the objective- is so much like the escape fro=
m
the ego in Sufism which I delineate in Eda:

"Everything in that poetry becomes relatively clear from that perspective.
Not only trees or animals, but in this poetry colors, objects, things,
natural processes are in dialogue with each other, weaving their endless
patterns. Eda is the structure of that pattern, the mesh of linguistic and
geographic coordinates which go to its creation. Not the individual, but
objects, colors, things are at the center of this endless transformation,
the ego attached to it only tangentially, a detail, suffering and ecstatic.
It is this peripheral relationship of consciousness to wider natural forces
=97 subjective and objective, visceral and abstract =97 which gives Turkish
poetry its  stunning originality.

Consciousness dies, the eye dis-solves into motion, silhouetted by the dark
matter of words." "The Spritual Life of Replicants"

As also in rubBEings, in this process time becomes the true subject, the
textures, the sounds of its unfolding, the intricate pattern it weaves. As =
a
result one enters a space where language "almost" not exist, a spot at the
periphery of language where language is in the process of being born, in
your words, not yet "sentimentalized."

Have you seen the Rivette film *La Petite Noisette* (the long, several hour=
s
version) where one hears the squeaks of the pen on paper as a portrait is
being painted "in real time" (which the spectator will never see in
completion and only in fragments in the process of being "created")? The
spectator only sees the "model" who stands nakes during most of the movie;
the painting itself is destroyed by the artist.


The thoughts of disappearance is.

Disappearance was.

Thoughts of was

 is. is.

is is sang the bird.

in alternating shades.


Ciao,

Murat

Thanks David and Murat for these 'rich' and giving responses.=20
David I love your 'industrial' vacant lot, street, etc. rubbings. Suggest b=
y the way a visit to the 'nonsite collective' web page and the materials an=
d introduction to Jonathan Skinner's discussion of the "Third Landscape" wh=
ere the focus is on the middle ground between 'the preserved' and 'the wild=
'. I think it's quite relevant to the spaces you explore and revive as a ki=
nd of visual gardener.
As to my own haptic work, I don't make my the process of my pieces to be a =
step removed from the materiality of the space in which I situate their mak=
ing (if that is what you are suggesting). I am very much 'in it.'=C2=A0 In =
fact, in terms of your process of 'rubbing',
when I am working, I=0A feel my senses are being 'rubbed' by whatever is em=
anating from the environment,=0A poetry reading,music collaboration, and so=
 forth. The pen becomes a kind of dancer - mediating between space and sens=
e responses. Yes, it is not 'objective' in the way of letting space occur a=
s independently as possible. But the work/art becomes, perhaps, a manifesta=
tion of this register of the=C2=A0 interplay between the two presences - ul=
timately a kind of oneness in which the artist works with neither an imperi=
al eye/sense or in a totally submissive or passive state. Frankly I like th=
e dialog (the dance) that leads to this state of being totally immersed and=
 in the motion of things as they are.=C2=A0 Restorative on all levels.=C2=

David,

"One hopes that as much as
possible that is not such but more the personality of the materials
themselves which is being expressed via the imprinting of itself done by as
"primitive=E2=80=99s possible method--that ancient one of the rubBEing."

What you are describing -both the nature of the escape from the ego and the
fusion of the subjective into the objective- is so much like the escape fro=
m
the ego in Sufism which I delineate in Eda:

"Everything in that poetry becomes relatively clear from that perspective.
Not only trees or animals, but in this poetry colors, objects, things,
natural processes are in dialogue with each other, weaving their endless
patterns. Eda is the structure of that pattern, the mesh of linguistic and
geographic coordinates which go to its creation. Not the individual,=0A but
objects, colors, things are at the center of this endless transformation,
the ego attached to it only tangentially, a detail, suffering and ecstatic.
It is this peripheral relationship of consciousness to wider natural forces
=E2=80=94 subjective and objective, visceral and abstract =E2=80=94 which g=
ives Turkish
poetry its=C2=A0 stunning originality.

Consciousness dies, the eye dis-solves into motion, silhouetted by the dark
matter of words." "The Spritual Life of Replicants"

As also in rubBEings, in this process time becomes the true subject, the
textures, the sounds of its unfolding, the intricate pattern it weaves. As =
a
result one enters a space where language "almost" not exist, a spot at the
periphery of language where language is in the process of being born, in
your words, not yet "sentimentalized."

Have you seen the Rivette film *La Petite Noisette* (the long, several hour=
s
version) where one hears=0A the squeaks of the pen on paper as a portrait i=
s
being painted "in real time" (which the spectator will never see in
completion and only in fragments in the process of being "created")? The
spectator only sees the "model" who stands nakes during most of the movie;
the painting itself is destroyed by the artist.


The thoughts of disappearance is.

Disappearance was.

Thoughts of was

 is. is.

is is sang the bird.

in alternating shades.


Ciao,

Murat

Hi Sarah,

You're missing the "Let's say" of my reply. The question is open in the
broadest sense; pragmatically, it matters - it becomes a function - when
grants, jobs, etc. are at stake.

I never thought of love or passion as a judgement, any more than illness
or death.

Of course we won't judge in another century - others will, if there are
still others. And judgement is never fixed; it's a question of taste,
connoisseurship, etc. I tend to think this gets into the nasty areas of
canon and genre - so much gets overlooked by the fetishization of critical
filters.

Finally, judging in the future, as now, is also a question of an attention
economy - none of us have infinite time to read, and a lot of our choices
may have a high degree of randomness to them. I just finished Lamartine's
Raphael, which I hadn't heard of, but stumbled upon in a used bookstore -
it "seemed" interesting. (And within that "seemed" lies pretty much all of
cultural studies).

formations, the status of ephemera and the making of genre, the conditions
of literary production, transatlantic cross-pollinations in and between
specific
magazines, the careers of poets, the role of book art, and how the little
magazine functions in the making of the avant-garde.

imagine print without literature, just news and technical documentation,
bills of lading, position papers, and so on.

imagine the moving picture without art, just as surveillance and
video-phone, etc.

now imagine the net without net art.

to many people, the latter is much easier to imagine than the former two
distopias. we have had literature for thousands of years and art has been a
part of the moving picture since near its start in the nineteenth century.
but net art has only been around since the early to mid 1990's. about 17
years, at this point, this being 2010. and the net is often treated as a
spewing information pipeline that has to be managed and filtered for usable
practical information often of a consumeristic nature. shopping information,
banking info, calendar info, and so on. as an entertainment medium, it's
mostly used for videos, online games, news, email communication, and so on.
not as a medium in which we seek out the art particular to the net. by 'net
art' i do not ,mean video or degraded print, (per se, although they can be
part of net art) but art specific to the net. that's what i mean by net art.
art that requires an internet connection and lives and breathes through a
browser or because of its internet connection, if it's a desktop program.

what we lose with there not being as prominent an art of the net as there is
of print and moving image is related to what we would lose were there not a
prominent art of print or art of the moving image.

some might object to that proposition. they might say that the net without
net art is no more difficult to imagine than the telephone without telephone
art. which is easy to imagine because the telephone hasn't developed
prominently as a medium for art. which isn't to say that there
haven't been good telephone art projects. but name me five of them.

the telephone has developed as a medium primarily for conversations between
participating parties. we don't dial up to listen to art, much. or
participate in an art project when we are actually on the phone. there's
nothing to say we couldn't. and perhaps we have, once or twice. still others
will say that the art of the telephone is the art of conversation. which
isn't specific to the telephone but is certainly different via telephone, in
important ways, than it is face to face.

we imagine, then, a secret art of the telephone in which lovers and others
really digging each other engage. often not recorded but enjoyed and
remembered personally, just the two (or n) of them. a private art without a
prominent public face. though telephone conversations and recordings play
crucial parts, sometimes, in works of art for other media such as movies,
drama, and music.

telephone has not developed a prominent public art because it is so strong
concerning private conversations. the possibilities for dial-up telephone
art or interactive telephone art are completely overshadowed by the way we
typically use the telephone, which is not a public art use or even an
artistic use of any kind, for the most part. we have trouble with fiction
and pretend, often, on the telephone. the stakes are different than in
reading a book or watching art because of the element of trust and personal
disclosure. to say nothing of fraud, which we also are quite familiar with
from the telephone.

the net is quite different from telephone, of course. it is not overwhelmed,
currently, by live conversation. we have had many of them, over the net but
it is by no means all we do over the net. the types of activities we engage
in include writing, viewing visual information, listening to auditory
information, responding to visual, sonic and written information, and a
variety of media, interactive or not. the net subsumes several media at
once. all broadcast media. and some broadcast that has not and cannot be
broadcast otherwise. that'd be the net art and other net-specific
broadcasts.

the net also subsumes private broadcasting, narrowcasting. the
telephone-even all forms of radio-even the CB, eventually-can be
net-based. the network is the frequency or set of frequencies. and the
frequency or frequencies can be channeled around the world.

the net also subsumes certain dimensions of print culture. publications have
a net component or are entirely net-based. the range is quite broad. the web
site may simply be a desolate info booth, devoid of interest, or it may rock
the universe in every way. it depends on the involvement in the net the
publication has. artistically, financially, as a distribution mechanism and
as a serious medium in its own right concerning content, the presentation of
content, the definition of content, the media of it, the permanence of it,
and so on. is it meant as entertainment or reference information or
queriable service and/or store or news channel or personal blog or as a post
within a larger network of sites one communicates with?

also, individuals publish their work on the net. sometimes on their own
sites, sometimes elsewhere. on journals, the sites of other individuals,
into huge youtubish databases, and so on. the net is both about publication
and communication. broadcasting and interaction. we are struggling to
understand how this changes the nature of publication itself. and the nature
of communication itself.

one of the great powers of the internet is it's ability to carry a broad
range of media and modes simultaneously or individually. by 'mode', i mean
its type of interactivities or lack thereof. by 'media' i mean sound,
visuals, text, and moving images.

it should be clear by now that the internet is going to play an increasingly
important role in broadcast, narrowcast and communication media. and in
knowledge storage and dissemination. and much else.

consequently, an art of the net poetentially becomes too broad and diffuse a
notion. the notion of 'digital art' is so vast it includes scans of photos
of one's cat posted to flickr. there can be no art form called 'digital art'
because 'digital art' is just any art that may even simply have been
digitized from analog and shoveled unreflectively to the realm of bits and
bytes. is 'net art', similarly, so broad as to not be a particular art form
in itself?

well, no, it's not. different people look at it in different ways. my way is
to specify an art in which the internet connection is crucial. whether for
communication or the querying of databases (and the subsequent retrieval of
dynamic information), or for other decisions relayed or processed
meaningfully via the net. the art of the net is one of the most important
envisionings of the possibilities the net holds concerning broadcast and
communications media, publication, and the synthesis of media, arts,
communication, technology, and science. the art of the net, ideally, is
where we go to get and understand our most intense and fully realized
visions of these possibilities-even when the art doesn't seem to be about
these things at all, sometimes. but of course we do not need to scratch too
deeply to understand that every painting is, in some sense, about painting,
every media work is about its medium, in some sense, to the degree that it
uses its media/um in media-specific ways. in its 'rhetoric of media', then.
and, more deeply yet, in its philosophy of media. stated or not. present or
implied or vacuous, a vacuum filled by the activity of the media/um all over
it like water over the swimmer.

net art encapsulates not only our deepest visions of the possibilities for
meaningful change via or partly because of the internet, but our deepest
visions concerning who and what we become via the existence of the net and
electronic networks more broadly. anything that involves important changes
in who and what we are and how we live and enjoy life and learn and
communicate and view and publish work is important for us to understand and
explore with passion-if for no other reason, then because to understand
these helps us know who and what we are becoming and maybe even already are.
and where we are going. and just what it means to be alive in this
particular age.

that is an important part of what we treasure about the art of the past. the
art of the past is one of our best ways of understanding life in the past.
we wonder if net art will enjoy that sort of status in the future because of
the issues of obsolescence of technology. will net art last long enough to
have that sort of use to futurity? or will it be continually of the moment?
firefly media of the moment that is burned quickly in the fire of
techno-time.

well, the jury is still out. certainly much, most, almost all will perish
and does so, so far, about every decade as browser technology changes and
networks expand into other, non-browser technologies and some protocols fall
out of use, eclipsed by brighter suns. but some net art persists. it takes
special engineering, often, a savvy knowledge of what's a good bet to work
with and what isn't.

the serious work will survive for some time. long enough to have that sort
of use to futurity. we're just not sure how far that futurity extends.

but, you know, it's never the thing beyond the grave that we want in this
life. except if it be peace or happiness or a like reward. and it is our joy
to find these in this life as we proceed. which is a way of saying that
whether net art now has a use to futurity later is not the only criterion to
measure its importance now. in fact, it's a terrible criterion because we
don't know the outcome now. the more important issue is what it does for us
now. and what it does for us now is help us understand the wired life now
and where it is going and how that changes us. and that's important to
understand who we are.

which implies that if net art fails as an art form then we lack artistic
ways to understand who and what we are via the introduction of the internet
into our worlds. this, in turn, would imply a sort of telephone-like usage
of the media/um of the net, a failure of imagination in the presence of
overwhelming homogenization of discourse. or a fundamental unfitness of net
worlds to provide an environment that can support art.
permanence/impermanence of media is a consideration. but so is monetary
economy. let's not forget that the monetary infrastructures that support art
as business are crucial to non-digital and digital art alike. the economies
of attention and valorization have strong ties to the monetary economies of
print, visual art, music, and so forth. the circles of 'high art' typically
have ties to the economic opportunities in the art. there is a sense in
which art has nothing to do with art but with marketing, public relations,
corporate or institutional sponsorship, friend networks, and other such
factors which-more than the quality of the art itself-determine the
standing of the art in society.

net art has not been particularly prominent in ecommerce. quite the
contrary. the idea is basically do what you love and the rest will follow.

it doesn't necessarily follow, of course, with any financial reward. this is
a hurdle net art has to navigate by hook or by crook. currently it is a very
tough proposition. net art has been a follower in this regard. the artists
have not really developed good economic models. or have not followed through
on them, when they have been imagined.

i remember reading what a new york artist wrote about mail art. he said it
was dead and wasn't of much account as art. isn't this sort of foolish
attitude simply a consequence of mail art remaining at a distance from the
galleries and a significant monetary economy? does his attitude have
anything to do with the art itself or familiarity with it? not likely. the
excitement people feel about art works or an art itself is often not about
the art itself but the value of the art as commodity valorized, ie,
marketed,
in appealing ways. we like to think of art as the house of what really
matters in life and relationships and thought and the meaning of life and
the creation of beauty, truth, and justice. and it is, in important ways.
but it is very much a house in this world, with all the troubles of other
houses. will net art continue to exist as mail art does? basically outside
the institutions? i think it's fundamentally a question of whether it
develops a significant monetary economy. it's not fundamentally a
question of the quality of the art itself. and this seems true to me
also of mail art.

another impediment to net art is the depth of art experience it can support.
what is the emotionally deepest flash work you've experienced? did it change
your life? art needs to be capable of being taken as seriously as
revelation. revelation and transformation are key aspects to our most
important art experiences. firefly media might do it, but not likely. what
is at issue here is the ability of net art to really help us understand who
and where we are, as opposed to merely our being given caricatures and
cartoons of existence-though they can be much more meaningful than we
usually admit. but, still, it's possible for media to lose or never find its
way to our deepest experience. net art seeks its way to our deepest
experience via the wire to inner worlds, outer worlds, and their
interpenetration.

net art must succeed for the internet to be as significant a human venture
as print or cinema. for if it fails, that means we cannot really feel it and
think in it in the ways we associate with art. and these are important to
the ways we understand ourselves and the world, and come to be articulate
and expressive and formulate what worlds we want to make now and for the
future. the failure of net art would be a massive failure of imagination
that would give unto the forces of dullness an unbearable lightness of
media, too complete a capacity for forgetting, and a medium without an inner
world.

net art seeks the human in the post-human, the post in the human, the human
in the post, and the post-human in the post-human. to know what it is to be
human now, and wired. no net art means the wired is tired. a tired wired is
wired working for the man, is corporate complete, is shop till long after
you have dropped, is dronification wired to the grind of slaves, the energy
of slaves, the no poetry zone, no imagination but in products, no ideas but
in products, the triumph of consumerism and perfectly thoughtless media.

accordingly, net art is important to the well-being and futurity of any
possible wired world, and to our understanding of our current situation and
capacities, even, as fireflies of eternity.

so we see what we lose with there not being as prominent an art of the net
as there is of print and moving image is related to what we would lose were
there not a prominent art of print or art of the moving image. those
distopian possibilities seem very remote, as possibilities, because the
media have such rich histories attached to them that we see the very
existence of print and moving image implying the growth of the artistic
cultures that have grown up with the media of print and the moving image,
respectively.

will we have a similar sense of the richness of history of net art in a
hundred years time? i think it will be a history fraught with more changes
in the technology than we associate with the history of print or the moving
image. so it will be more fragmented a history, consequently. the net art
media species, as it were, will evolve and change and mutate in ways we
associate with hyperspaces. but it will have known histories, nonetheless,
contentious and mysterious, almost, as the present, for anyone who looks
closely into the fire at the contradictions of even the moment of art.

The UCC English Literature Society is delighted to welcome Ian
Patterson and Jenny Diski to Cork.


JENNY DISKI was born in London in 1947. She was educated at University
College, London, and worked as a teacher during the 1970s and early
1980s. She is a regular contributor to The Observer and the London
Review of Books.

Her first novel, Nothing Natural, the story of a single parent locked
in an abusive relationship, was published in 1986 (reissued 2003).
Subsequent novels include Rainforest (1987), in which a female
anthropologist is shocked by her discoveries about human nature; Then
Again (1990), a complex narrative exploring the life of a persecuted
Jewish girl living in fourteenth-century Poland; Happily Ever After
(1991), the story of the relationship between an eccentric old woman
and her landlord, a middle-aged alcoholic; and The Dream Mistress
(1996), set in contemporary London, about three women whose stories
are loosely connected: Mimi, Leah - the mother who abandoned her -and
Bella, a tramp who Mimi saves at the beginning of the novel. The
Vanishing Princess (1995) is a collection of short stories.

She published a volume of autobiography, Skating to Antarctica, in
1997, which was shortlisted for the Jewish Quarterly Literary Prize
for Non-Fiction, and a book of essays, Don't, in 1998. Jenny Diski is
also the author of two television plays, A Fair and Easy Passage,
written for Channel 4 television, and The Ultimate Object of Desire.

Stranger on a Train: Daydreaming and Smoking around America with
Interruptions (2002), a travelogue narrating a railway journey around
the United States, is the winner of the 2003 Thomas Cook Travel Book
Award. A View from the Bed (2003) is a compendium of essays and
literary reviews. Her novel, Only Human: A Comedy (2000), reworks the
biblical story of Abraham and Sarah told in Genesis, chapters 11 to
22, and After These Things (2004) continues the story, centring on the
relationship between Abraham's son Isaac and Isaac's son Jacob. Her
non-fiction book, On Trying to Keep Still, was published in 2006.

Jenny Diski lives in Cambridge. Her recent books include Apology for
the Woman Working (2008) and The Sixties (2009)

Just in case anyone can make it, or can pass the word along:

I'll be reading this week in Vancouver (University of British Columbia and
Simon Fraser University), and in Seattle (Pilot Books),  mostly from my
just-released Chax Press book, Ghost Snow Falls through the Void
(Globalization).

A thousand bows to Chax Press and Charles Alexander, for doing the book AND
for working some miracles at the Tucson Festival of Books (Charles
Bernstein, Alice Notley, Anne Waldman, Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge all conjured up
for a fabulous few days).

Michael Heller: Beckmann Variations and other poems

Published 15 March 2010

Paperback, 80pp, 8.5x5.5ins, =A38.95 / $15
ISBN 9781848610873

Ekphrasis, that ancient mode found in Homer's=20
description of Achilles's shield or Keats'=20
Grecian Urn, is here transformed in Michael=20
Heller's meditations in poetry and prose on work=20
by the painter Max Beckmann. Heller navigates,=20
sometimes with Yeats as his Virgil, through a=20
gallery of Beckmann's pictures, seeing them as=20
uniquely bringing home contemporary=20
civilization's catastrophic impulses ("as if days=20
were not for sanity"), impulses at once horrific=20
and unsettling yet strangely beautiful and restorative.
Comments on Michael Heller=92s recent work:
=93At once grave and uplifting, Heller=92s poems are=20
serene meditations on time, decay, and loss that=20
recover from the ruin a repletion that is also a=20
recognition of our necessary incompleteness=20
before the world and language.=94=ADPatrick Pritchett in Jacket Magazine

=93In a poetic generation that has frequently=20
settled for small answers, his work insists upon=20
the largest questions.=94=ADRobert Zaller in Rain Taxi

=93He accepts that his poetry is a fold in a great=20
conversation of commentary, that linguistic=20
=93meeting place=94 in which he posits his faith. And=20
it is in this belief, inspiring his practice,=20
that Heller=92s poetry paradoxically achieves its=20
magisterial power.=94=ADNorman Finkelstein on The Big Jewish Blog

Michael Heller is a poet, essayist and=20
critic.  His most recent books are Eschaton, a=20
collection of poems (Talisman, 2009), Speaking=20
The Estranged: Essays on the Work of George Oppen=20
(Salt 2009), and Two Novellas: Marble Snows & The=20
Study (ahadadabooks, 2009).  He is the recipient=20
of many honors and grants including the=20
DiCastagnola Prize of the Poetry Society of=20
America, the National Endowment for the=20
Humanities, the New York Foundation for the Arts and the Fund for Poetry.

The Department of English at City University of Hong Kong is pleased to =
announce a one-year full Tuition Scholarship, to be awarded to a 2010 =
candidate for our new, international, low-residency Masters of Fine Arts =
(MFA) in Creative Writing.  The winner will be the applicant who submits =
the sample of creative writing that demonstrates the greatest potential =
for success as a professional literary author. Applicants in any genre =
are eligible, as long as they meet the acceptance criteria for this =
postgraduate degree.  There is no restriction as to country of =
residence, age or nationality.

 At City University, we seek to develop Asia=92s future writers, and =
this scholarship is offered to attract the most talented writers to our =
programme.  This summer, we begin our first class of writers for the MFA =
in Creative Writing specialising in Asian Writing in English, the first =
programme in the world to offer this specialty.  Based in the English =
department, the innovative 45-credit, two-year programme will accept a =
limited number of students in creative non-fiction, fiction and poetry.  =
The degree is benchmarked to international standards for the MFA.  The =
Hong Kong native author Xu Xi assisted in its development and joined the =
Department as their first Writer-in-Residence on March 1.

=93We anticipate the majority of applicants to be from Asia,=94 Xu says, =
=93but many writers in the West, both of Asian and non-Asian ethnicity, =
are increasingly drawn to Asia, especially China. They=92re not always =
best served by MFA programmes in the West where there=92s little focus =
on either a contemporary or historical Asian perspective or Asian =
literature.=94 The faculty will all be writers who =91know Asia, live =
Asia, read Asia, write Asia=92 as the programme=92s advertising says. =
The top criterion for admission will be the quality of creative work.

This initiative is part of an overall strategy to develop the creative =
curriculum at the university. Professor Kingsley Bolton, Head of English =
at City University says, =93Our English Department is a very young one, =
but probably one of the most dynamic and innovative departments of its =
kind in Asia. In the next few years, we are aiming to make the English =
Department here a leading centre for creative writing, drama, and =
cultural studies, not only for Hong Kong but also for the whole of the =
Asian region.=94 The MFA is generally considered a professional degree, =
qualifying students to work in professions where good writing skills are =
required, as well as providing the groundwork for an international =
writing and publishing career.

The low-residency graduate degree model is relatively new in Asia. A =
long-established pedagogical model in the U.S., such programmes are =
especially suited for the creative arts. In particular, this programme =
is ideal for working professionals who cannot afford to spend two years =
as full-time graduate students in a traditional writing programme. =
Structured for individualised learning, students work via distance =
learning with writing mentors on a one-on-one basis during the =
semesters, and attend brief =91residencies=92 at the university two to =
three times a year. The low faculty-to-student ratio allows for =
intensive feedback on the student=92s work and approximates the =
professional editor-writer relationship.

The first residency is scheduled for summer 2010. The internationally =
renowned novelist Timothy Mo will be Visiting Writer and the faculty =
writers for the 2010 class features an international cast from Hong =
Kong, India, the U.K, Canada and the U.S., with connections and roots in =
China, Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and elsewhere. The =
writers include Tina Chang, Marilyn Chin, Luis Francia, Robin Hemley, =
Justin Hill, Sharmistha Mohanty, James Scudamore, Ravi Shankar, Jess Row =
and Madeleine Thien. For applications, please visit =
http://www.english.cityu.edu.hk/MFA.  For further information, please =
email mfawriting@cityu.edu.hk or call Xu Xi at ++852.3442.8732.

Janet Hamill & Margaret Randall

Janet Hamill is the author of five books of poetry: Troublante (Oliphant
Press), The Temple (Telephone Books), Nostalgia of the Infinite (Ocean View
Books), Lost Ceilings (Telephone Books); and her most recent collection,
Body of Water, published by Bowery Books, and nominated for the Poetry
Society of America=B9s William Carlos Williams Prize. She has released two
CD=B9s of spoken word and music in collaboration with the band Moving Star.
Flying Nowhere (Yes No Maybe Records, 2000) was produced by Lenny Kaye and
executive-produced by Bob Holman; the CD featured cameo performances by
Lenny Kaye and Patti Smith. Genie of the Alphabet (Not Records 2005)
featured cameos by Lenny Kaye, Patti Smith, Bob Holman and David Amram.

Margaret Randall lived for almost a quarter century in Latin America:
Mexico, Cuba, and Nicaragua. When she returned to the United States, in
1984, the Immigration and Naturalization Service ordered her deported
because of opinions expressed in some of her books. With the help of many
writers and others, she won her case in 1989. During the 1960s, out of
Mexico City, Randall and Mexican poet Sergio Mondragon published the
influential bi-lingual poetry journal El Corno Emplumado / The Plumed Horn.
She has also done a great deal of translation from the Spanish, making such
Latin American poets as Roque Dalton, Otto Rene Castillo, and others
available to an English readership. Among Randall=B9s most recent books of
poetry are Where They Left You For Dead (BookWorks), Stones Witness (The
University of Arizona Press), and Their Backs To The Sea (Wings Press). My
Town will be published by Wings in 2010. Randall lives with her partner,
Barbara Byers, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, from where she travels widely to
read and speak.

A Similar But Different Quality Magazine Reading

A Similar But Different Quality is an experimental text-based journal
unspecific to any genre. The sole parameter is that the work is text, which
opens us to the surprise and poetry of language that is everywhere.
Published occasionally, their manifesto reads:

Accidents. Words are everywhere and inevitably beautiful. What tries to be
poetic is often not because true poetry is an accident. The poetry genre is
paradoxically unpoetic, too narrow to contain the full beauty of language
that permeates everyday conversation, movie dialogue, graffiti, theatre,
song lyrics, notes, diary entries, grocery lists, receipts, rap, text
messages, emails, spam, tweets, etc, etc. To poetry without boundaries,
except the words. Not poetry, but words. To an immediate, unpretentious and
zesty poetry.

I, Benjamin: A Quasi-Autobiographical Novella by Theodore Enslin
With an Afterword by Howard McCord.

Publication: March 25, 2010 (the author=92s 85th birthday)

$10.00 trade paperback, 63 pages, 0-929701-90-9 / 978-0929701-90-5


A lonely man possessing special powers crosses into an unknown country. =
There he meets three mysterious figures: an alluring diva, a =
shape-shifting siren, and an oddly omniscient hunter. Gradually the =
four-part variations of I, Benjamin assume the disquieting dimensions of =
a visionary passageway to that unknowable thing called a beautiful life. =


Theodore Enslin=92s poetic career spans 52 years since the publication =
of his first book, The Work Proposed; now as his self-proclaimed swan =
song he presents a "quasi-autobiographical" fable of an artist=92s life. =


"Enslin writes himself a life, a melodious, ideal and legendary one, a =
dream life that comes to the man-child when he decides to make art his =
life. This tale is charming, and is, besides, a marvelous recipee for =
making oneself a life out of words. The reader roams this confined =
paradise until it suddenly opens, and then one wants to stay." -- Andrei =
Codrescu

"Enslin=92s story, a pilgrimage from "Exurbia" to solitary life in the =
woods and his subsequent journey back, is reminiscent of Thoreau. The =
narrative, which approaches allegory, oscillates between a dreamy =
sublimity and Spartan intention. Running through this ethereal story are =
more austere currents: the limitations of time and body, and the despair =
of loneliness. Fans of the poet will of course be fascinated by the =
journey, but more broadly, this exploration offers an intriguing sojourn =
to those interested in metaphysical travel or in the life cycle of an =
artist." -- Jen Sperry-Steinorth, ForeWord Reviews (March-April issue)

Theodore Vernon Enslin (born March 25, 1925) is the last living American =
poet of the first circle associated with Cid Corman's Origin magazine =
and press (which included Robert Creeley, Charles Olson, and two earlier =
Objectivists, George Oppen and Louis Zukofsky). He is one of the most =
musical of American avant-garde poets. Enslin was born in Chester, =
Pennsylvania. His father was a noted biblical scholar and his mother a =
teacher of Latin. He studied musical composition at Cambridge, =
Massachusetts with Nadia Boulanger, who recognized his ability as a =
writer and encouraged him to pursue his interest in poetry. He has said =
"I like to be considered as a composer who happens to use words instead =
of notes." Hs first book, The Work Proposed, was published by Origin in =
1958. Enslin moved to Maine in 1960 and has lived in Washington County =
ever since, working at odd jobs and making and selling handmade walking =
sticks. The Maine landscape forms an integral part of his poetry, as =
does the isolation, both geographic and in terms of distance from =
literary fashion and the academy. Ranger (1978) is regarded as one of =
the key American long poems of the second half of the 20th century.

For those of you who didn't know her, Sondra Ball was an amazing woman.
She created the award winning poetry journal Autum Leaves.
The dedication and work on her part to do this every Month for almost 20 years
tells you a little about what kind of person Sondra was.

But to know her best was to read her poems. Always filled with nature, purity of spirit, and kindness,
her poems were a glimpse at the wonderful heart that drove the woman.

Sondra changed my life's path, no doubt about it. She published my poetry over 100 times.
She took the time to give me advice, and aim my own poetic aspirations.Lastly, she became
a friend I spoke with, depended, on and will miss dearly as my life goes on .

This is one of her poems that now bring tears to my eyes because of it's beauty.
The Far Side
by Sondra Ball




She walks in my dream
among fields and winding roads.
It is a spring day,
and it is snowing on flowers
scattered among the grasses.

Her face is troubled
by snow falling on lilacs
and on cherry blooms.
I lie on a purple bed
on the far side of the vale.

I watch her walking.
She does not know I am here,
that I can see her
inside her troubled poses,
captured by this spring snow storm.

proving Italian ain't always easy. Ferlinghetti is mostly Italian due 2 the=
 spelling of his surname. Mary Jo Salter is half/Italian. I'm half Italian =

merge as the projects moves along.  That to me is the really beautiful=0Apa=
rt of the Anthology--that it is being assembled in "real time" and on=0Alin=

=0Aexamples which might function as "answers," what one really finds, to=0A=
me at any rate, is the openness to a continual questioning and finding, an=
=0Aopenness to the idea that this is not already a pre conceived set of exa=

Read a great review by Thom Donovan of Jane Sprague's The Port of Los
Angeles here:

	http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2010/03/jane-spragues-the-port-of-los-angeles/

and you can order the book from Chax Press, http://chax.org, or from
Small Press Distribution, http://spdbooks.org/

Five new books by Chax Press are up on our site, but only under the
"subscription" link on the index page at chax.org -- in a number of
days they will be up with their own pages, and I'll post a message.
But it's not too late to take advantage of the subscription savings
price. The books are:

	Alice Notley, REASON AND OTHER WOMEN ($21)
	Charles Bernstein, UMBRA ($15)
	Barbara Henning, CITIES AND MEMORY ($16)
	Tenney Nathanson, GHOST SNOW FALLS THROUGH THE VOID (GLOBALIZATION)
($17)
	Anne Waldman, MATRIOT ACTS ($15)

	Total retail price from our web site, when they are up, will be $84
plus shipping. The subscription price for these five is $70 with no
shipping charges added, and the offer will be temporary.

	For those of you who have already subscribed, your books will be
shipped in the coming week.
	

Thank you for considering Chax Press books,

Charles

invites you to a book party/reading for

A PLACE IN THE SUN

a new novel by Lewis Warsh

Friday, March 26, 7-9:30

Bowery Poetry Club

308 Bowery

(between Houston & Bleecker) Manhattan

With a show of art work by cover artist Pamela Lawton

"A deeply engrossing book, I couldn't put it down. And now that I've =20
finished reading it I can't put it away, for how it furthers my =20
thinking of the genre itself. A Place in the Sun beautifully combines =20=

the high action and salaciousness of page-turners, with the self-=20
reflection and risk-taking of post-modern fiction. It's a must-read =20
and a must-study." Renee Gladman

"Lewis Warsh brings his poet's sensibility to a mash up of literary =20
and genre fiction techniques =96 including constantly shifting =20
perspectives and unexpected interconnections =96 to create an =20
intriguingly compelling and deeply satisfying reading experience. I =20
loved it." Michael Lally

"A Place in the Sun is a beautifully rendered and expertly =20
deconstructed novel. Warsh's stunningly effective use of multiple =20
narratives, provided in exquisitely detailed lines, conveys an elastic =20=

and powerful emotional honesty. This is a sensual and desperate story =20=

from a writer with formidable powers of invention." Donald Breckenridge

"In weaving together the cold, explicit facts, gossipy rumors and =20
largely sexual fantasies of the lives of Clift, Taylor, and Drieser, =20
Lewis Warsh creates a tripartite threnody of its own genuine American =20=

tragedy, the off-screen, off-page dark truths hidden beneath the drab, =20=

glittering surface crust of American life. William Carlos Williams =20
wrote in "To Elsie":  "The pure products of America go crazy...." =20
Warsh has captured that in mimicking a sensationalized tabloid voice =20
of a 1950s Confidential mag's hot, breathless prose, and taking a =20
transcendent leap from that gossip and rumor into one of the "great =20
poems of death" Walt Whitman exhorted American poets to write." =20

It's with great pleasure that I announce the publication of _Via_ by
Andrew Brewerton.

_Via_ consists of thirteen eight-line stanzas and any amount of sturdy
grace. It's light and open structure seems practically inexhaustible,
though by no means exhausting. Quite the opposite. A real joy.

To obtain a copy, please write to me  at 16a Ballyman Road, Bray, County
Wicklow, Ireland.

The cost is that figure other than infinity which is the same in all
currencies.

See http://www.wildhoneypress.com/BOOKS/Via.htm for more details.

best

Randolph

Hi Gerald,

Define "great," and "work" here. The question doesn't make sense. Why
doesn't a good team win all its games? How do you compare earlier and
later Picabia? Is Chaucer's Astrolabe a great work? The question, it seems
to me, either has an obvious answer - that some things some people are
"great" to other people, and some things aren't - or dissolves through an
inherent sloppiness.

- Alan

Michael, who I never knew


Michael Benedikt and George E. Wellwarth edited Modern French Theatre: The
Avant-Garde, Dada, and Surrealism. I recently bought a used copy of the
book, first edition. It might have been Benedikt's first book. There's an
author's signature on the title page, and an inscription inside the front
cover:


for Mother dear

      and F.F.

with thanks for the right genes,

              Michael


Michael Benedikt was born in 1935 and died in 2007. I didn't know him.
There is something uncanny about the inscription. Michael Benedikt lived
72 years. I think perhaps he gave this to his mother with a sense of
pride; he was 29. I think to myself: He gave this book to his mother and
F.F., perhaps a father. His mother and perhaps F.F. died, and Michael
inherited. It would have been sad for the book to be returned to him,
after a temporary journey of pride and happiness. And then Michael died
and someone, perhaps a wife or other relative, sold or gave away some of
his books, perhaps all of them, and this was one of them. And so Modern
French Theater ends up in Adam Tobin's book-store, coming from somewhere,
somewhere unknown, perhaps untraceable, and I am reading and learning a
great deal, revisiting some old friends, playwrights within. I fear death,
death dominates me; I am constantly fighting off depression as best I can.
As we run out of money, depression and stress increase. And I think: soon
this book will be passed on, and I am less than a silent witness to its
passing. So perhaps this is the singing of a solitary and mournful note,
so that its passing will be remembered. And perhaps this will be forgotten
as well.

Subject:      New Ted Enslin book
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="Windows-1252"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

McPherson & Co. is very pleased to announce Theodore Enslin's new book, =
I, Benjamin, to be published on Thursday, March 25th.

I, Benjamin: A Quasi-Autobiographical Novella by Theodore Enslin
With an Afterword by Howard McCord.

Publication: March 25, 2010 (the author=92s 85th birthday)

$10.00 trade paperback, 63 pages, 0-929701-90-9 / 978-0929701-90-5


Theodore Enslin=92s poetic career spans 52 years since the publication =
of his first book, The Work Proposed; now as his self-proclaimed swan =
song he presents a "quasi-autobiographical" fable of an artist=92s life. =
A lonely man possessing special powers crosses into an unknown country. =
There he meets three mysterious figures: an alluring diva, a =
shape-shifting siren, and an oddly omniscient hunter. Gradually the =
four-part variations of I, Benjamin assume the disquieting dimensions of =
a visionary passageway to that unknowable thing called a beautiful life. =


"Enslin writes himself a life, a melodious, ideal and legendary one, a =
dream life that comes to the man-child when he decides to make art his =
life. This tale is charming, and is, besides, a marvelous recipee for =
making oneself a life out of words. The reader roams this confined =
paradise until it suddenly opens, and then one wants to stay." -- Andrei =
Codrescu

"Enslin=92s story, a pilgrimage from "Exurbia" to solitary life in the =
woods and his subsequent journey back, is reminiscent of Thoreau. The =
narrative, which approaches allegory, oscillates between a dreamy =
sublimity and Spartan intention. Running through this ethereal story are =
more austere currents: the limitations of time and body, and the despair =
of loneliness. Fans of the poet will of course be fascinated by the =
journey, but more broadly, this exploration offers an intriguing sojourn =
to those interested in metaphysical travel or in the life cycle of an =
artist." -- Jen Sperry-Steinorth, ForeWord Reviews (March-April issue)

Theodore Vernon Enslin (born March 25, 1925) is the last living American =
poet of the first circle associated with Cid Corman's Origin magazine =
and press (which included Robert Creeley, Charles Olson, and two earlier =
Objectivists, George Oppen and Louis Zukofsky). He is one of the most =
musical of American avant-garde poets. Enslin was born in Chester, =
Pennsylvania. His father was a noted biblical scholar and his mother a =
teacher of Latin. He studied musical composition at Cambridge, =
Massachusetts with Nadia Boulanger, who recognized his ability as a =
writer and encouraged him to pursue his interest in poetry. He has said =
"I like to be considered as a composer who happens to use words instead =
of notes." Hs first book, The Work Proposed, was published by Origin in =
1958. Enslin moved to Maine in 1960 and has lived in Washington County =
ever since, working at odd jobs and making and selling handmade walking =
sticks. The Maine landscape forms an integral part of his poetry, as =
does the isolation, both geographic and in terms of distance from =
literary fashion and the academy. Ranger (1978) is regarded as one of =
the key American long poems of the second half of the 20th century.

Dear Alan,

This is exactly how knowledge of certain kind, poetry, someone's vision gets
translated, through happenstance, distraction partial destruction and
occasional, precious momentary illuminations. Thank you for this wonderful
passage. More real than desperate attempts to institutionalize hierarchies.

All knowledge is built on fragments of other knowledge.

Ciao,

Murat

Thank you Alan, for your characteristically generous tribute to Michael
Benedikt.  I never met him either, but in recent years have had many
occasions to bless his memory.  His landmark 60s anthology of US poets
theater work THEATRE EXPERIMENT was the direct predecessor to teh book
that David Brazil and I have been editing, THE KENNING ANTHOLOGY OF POETS
THEATER 1945-1985.  THEATRE EXPERIMENT, with its swirl of myriad theaters,
everyone from e.e. cummings to Carolee Schneeman, was the benchmark we
hoped to emulate.  The guy must really have been something, as you
suggest.

please forgive the straight white maleness of my thinking on this, but
one of the things that I've noticed about the burlesque revival that
this sort of poetry seems to fit into is that it is not so much about
the experience of desire, but about being the object of desire and
specifically of male desire. Which, strictly speakang, seems like it's
a separate issue from straight vs. queer, which is the area of human
experience defined by the experience of desire as opposed to being
desired. to my thinking, then, what's therefore missing from a queer
perspective in the burlesque revival is the subjugation of lesbian
sexuality as a performance for a male audience.

the riot grrl movement, as i remember it, was more about a direct
response to the violence inherent in male sexual desire and the
various coping strategies for that. of course, i was pretty young at
the time, and a lot of my experience of it was probably colored by
both the reaction to Mia Zapata's rape and murder and the song 7 year
bitch did about it which for a couple of my teenage summers was pretty
ubiquitous, and also the fact that it was our scene unfortunately that
pushed the whole riot grrl thing out of the underground with Hole's
mainstream success. but that said, where burlesque revival stuff seems
largely about enjoying being desired separate from one's own desire,
the riot grrl position as I saw it was about the inseparability of
desire and being desired and the affront to one's humanity that
dealing with the sensuality of female bodies in isolation from the
female libido is.

About The Short Movie Review (TSMR); Submissions

The Short Movie Review will investigate short movies that are freely
available online from a variety of perspectives: Marxist, capitalist,
poetic, Freudian, straight, gay, engendered, naive, know-it-all.

Email Submissions & Questions to: francisraven@gmail.com
When submitting put the word =92submission=92 in the subject.

I love short films.  You can do so many things in them that in a
longer film would be boring, too shocking, impossible to maintain, or
way too random.  They are like little windows into a world, a world
where you may not actually want to live, but where it=92s pretty cool to
visit.  Short movies give film makers an opportunity to explore a
little nugget of an idea that might not be able to sustain a feature
length film; sometimes they are the MacGuffin without the chase scene
and other times they are the chase scene without main characters.
They are a main idea that has exploded.  They are experiments in
living.  There is an obvious parallel to short stories, but while much
critical work has been devoted to short stories not much ink has been
spilled over short films.  We here at TSMR hope to remedy this dire
situation.

In addition, we are living in the golden age of short films (and
particularly movies that are freely available) due to the lower costs
of production, the use of short films to lure audiences into bigger
things or networks or pyramid schemes, and Youtube, Wholphin, and
other websites specializing in short films.

The TSMR will be released quarterly, but will be updated as content
arrives. Please submit reviews to TSMR.  Guidelines: the movie (which
should 40 minutes or less) must be available online for free.  Please
include a link to the film.  Otherwise, go for it.  Short and long
reviews are fine by us.  We=92d love to see some poetry as reviews or
drawings or diagrams or movies as reviews of short movies.  Critical
reviews assessing the genre as a whole will also be looked upon
favorably.  Be angry or submissive; positive or negative.  Try not to
be boring.

Thank you, Dave:=0A=0ARothenburg's evolving outsider poetics seems almost t=
oo perfect ( poetry, you know, it's an elitist thing, right?). Or does poet=
ry belong to the people? We need a death & dying poetics, a domestic bliss =
poetics, a poetics that can somehow reach the poor. Is that possible? We've=
 had instructors inside of=C2=A0 the penitentiary, anthologies that focused=
 on the poetry of prisoners. Jimmy Santiago Baca was once illiterate but=C2=
=A0learned how to read and write while incarcerated. Maybe Rothenburg can l=
ook in that direction. It should be possible to appeal to the educated read=
er without including the standard list of mainstream poets and regardless t=
he particular school of poetics. According to Jorie Graham, Poetry, the thi=
ng itself, is an outside art form. But Graham is refering to the marketplac=
e. In "Best American Poetry," 1990, she writes: =0A=0A=C2=A0=C2=A0 What is =
especially interesting about=C2=A0poetry's current situation is that it is =
pratically alone, among the art forms being practiced, in still viewing the=
 artist as essentially an outsider to the marketplace. =C2=A0=0A=0AIn addit=
ion, consider: Is it still possible to shock the bourgeoisie with little mo=
re than the naked word? What if Mom & Dad had dinner with a poet, someone n=
ice, not a beaten down bohemian. What if Mom & Dad had dinner with ME or St=
eve Dalichinsky ( assuming that Steve isn't too shocking )? A presentable, =
well mannered poet such as myself could read some nice poetry, a little Rob=
ert Bly, some Ted Kooser, but Mom & Dad would also have to sit still and he=
ar the voices of Baraka, Spicer, Plath, Ginsberg, the Buk, or OOga-Booga ( =
a Seidel book ). Dave, didn't you critique Bernstein for asking other poets=
 to be other than direct when they argued for a fair deal for Palestine? Ag=
ain, Seidel=C2=A0refers to =C2=A0the West as "Oilchoholics," that "fist-fuc=
king anus swallowing a fist." He adds, " you're wondering=C2=A0 why I talk =
this way, so daintily." Good ole Sid, the ultimate man of leisure, a rich g=
uy who gets IT.=0A=0ADidn't Freud say something about poetics envy?=C2=A0=
=0A=0APerhaps an outsider ( an anti-bohemian/anti-bourgeoisie ) is simply t=

Subject:      WE ARE 7
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Over a 7 year period the human body replaces all of its cells until --
7 years later -- the body is completely new, a whole new body, a body
which actually didn't exist 7 years ago.  7 years ago today we were
not here as we are today.  7 years ago today when America invaded the
sovereign nation of Iraq.  Over a million people have been killed.
Their bodies didn't make it here with us.  So many people I'm never
going to meet or see or know.  I'm very sad today thinking about my
new body, my luxury of a new body of cells over the past 7 years of
war, 7 years of terrorizing people.  This morning I went to the Kelly
Writers House to hear Susan Howe give one of the finest Q&A's I've
ever heard.  And I almost asked her at the Q&A, "Susan, in your book
THE EUROPE OF TRUSTS you write, 'Malice dominates the history of Power
and Progress.'  How do you feel about us stepping out of history today
with today being the anniversary of the American invasion of Iraq?"
But I didn't ask her that.  She seemed so happy sitting there, and
life is short, and here's this amazing elderly genius poet, and I
thought, "Don't ask her that."  So I didn't ask her that.  Instead I
asked her about her visit to Wallace Stevens's house, and how she had
said that she couldn't believe THOSE poems came from THAT house, and I
wanted her talk about HER poems being written where she writes them.
Please tell us about the aura of space, is what I meant to say.

There's so much responsibility that goes into being a citizen, but
somehow we have had the trouble of the responsibility removed from us.
 And it's the darkest thing, that removal.  I'm not saying THAT I KNOW
and UNDERSTAND the new bodies around me in the anniversary of America
bringing UNIMAGINABLE suffering and agony to Iraq.  I'm not saying
THAT I KNOW but I do know some of the bodies in my proximity and how
they fair.  A week ago my new next door neighbor left the apartment
with his girlfriend and dog, and said, literally said, "Well we don't
have cable installed yet, so we're going to the park."  He seemed sad
about going to the park.  The girlfriend said, "Yeah, the cable man
didn't show, what a drag."  The dog was the only one who seemed happy.
 And then the cable man came, and now, every single day, all day long
I hear the television whenever I walk by their door.  Canned laughter
is what I hear sometimes.  They're watching sitcoms or something and
they're not laughing, just the canned laughter.  And the dog is so
annoyed that the cable man came, I'm sure of it.  I'll always remember
them leaving to go to the park, this very healthy young couple with
their dog because they couldn't watch the television.

No, I'm not saying I understand what everyone's going through.
Sometimes people watch a lot of television because they're depressed.
But I'm not sure.  And in Philadelphia we've been having Twitter Mobs
(or some call them Flash Mobs), and part of me wants to say that I
identify with these kids, today, on the anniversary of the American
invasion of Iraq.  Hundreds and hundreds of them meet up, and then
each time something breaks loose and they begin beating on people,
wrecking things, hundreds of them.  And I want to say that I
understand their anger.  But I don't.  I'm angry.  I'm very angry.
Every single day I'm angry.  I'm living in a country that cares more
about bombing people of color overseas and stealing their resources
than putting kids through college.  And the ad campaigns to make us
FEEL OKAY like saying "MARCH IS AMERICAN RED CROSS MONTH" because
WE'RE SUCH GOOD PEOPLE!  We're such good people, here, in America,
today, on the anniversary of bombing where there are many people who
still hear the bombs in the middle of the night, and sometimes it's a
dream, and sometimes it's not, because it's still a war, it's still
not entirely a dream.  But I'M ANGRY AT THESE KIDS for scaring me on
the bus the other day when I found myself in the middle of a Twitter
Mob WHILE ON THE BUS and the kids banged their fists on the sides of
the bus as we drove down the street through the chaos.  And Frank
Sherlock called me to see if I made it home safely, he's a very good
friend.  I want to be SO ANGRY at these kids because I would never
want to hurt anyone, just anyone, just any stranger.  But yet we're
living in a country which does that.  We drop bombs on people's
houses.  And the animals in the zoos.  The zoo of Baghdad and the
apartments, and, and, and, we have new bodies this year.

There's never going to be a moment in this lifetime for us, THOSE OF
US ALIVE NOW, IN AMERICA, PAYING TAXES, WHICH PURCHASE WAR, we will
never be able to apologize enough to the people of Iraq, and we knew
it.  We knew it.  We all kept saying we knew it, we knew that there
were no WMD's, we knew it, everyone knew it.  We kept telling one
another days before the invasion, "I THINK THEY'RE LYING DON'T YOU
THINK THEY'RE LYING YEAH I THINK SO TOO YEAH ME TOO THEY'RE LYING WE
KNOW THEY'RE LYING EVERYONE KNOWS IT!"  But it happened anyway, the
bombing.  The occupation.  And now the genocide of HUNDREDS of gay man
in Iraq as a direct result of the invasion and occupation, we are now
responsible for this new genocide.  Gay men tortured and murdered in
Iraq.  A year of genocide.  A year at the end of seven years of
American occupation.  And we distract ourselves with LISTENING about
the health care reform.  Health care reform?  What about the health of
EVERYONE in Iraq?  What about them?  But we get to feel good.  And
it's AMERICAN RED CROSS MONTH.  And I'm not being mean, but that's
fucked up to be saying MARCH IS AMERICAN RED CROSS MONTH when America
brings more need for bandages than any other country on the face of
the planet right now, how do we do it?  How do we get to feel this
way?  How?  I'm so sad today.  I'm not being mean, I'm sad.  I'm an
American citizen who has believed lies and now I know I will never
vote Democrat again.  Ever.  There's too much responsibility behind
giving killers your time and your vote.  It costs so much.  I feel
that costs today.  I'm sad.

Dear Alan:

Thank you so much for your beaitufl and moving piece.
I know the book well--a classic--
what you write for myself is one of the examples of the Found=2C which is w=
hat my own work is directly working with always-
the Found=2C as you note--untraceable often=2C and for that very reason=2C =
so freed of accrued and already-set associations wide open to your own--to =
on'e s own=2C which are created in the direct=2C touched and held contact=
=2C with the materials--
re your depression and death--
i have been clinically dead 4 times=2C another time experienced following a=
 truck accident in which my spine was shattered the first time=2C an "Near =
Death Experience=2C" though at the time=2C such a subject was not very much=
 spoken of--
right now i am slated for a hip surgery next month=2C to be followed by yet=
 another broken back surgery--the doctors always say they have no idea how =
i am alive let alone able to walk at all--
i suffered many years and stil have the experience of a near overwhelming v=
oice inside me directing me to kil myself accompanied by various hallucinat=
ory visions-
five members my immediate family killed themselves in the last thirty years=
--and sevral others attempted--
i carry a continual darkness some days which obliterates the brightest sun =
light and burns like flames through the darkest nights-
all of these things have made me love life all the more--each day no matter=
 what i more thankful than i can ever express to be alive
in my experience=2C there is never a dull moment! to sit and see the passag=
eoflight beam across a floor=2C among the dust motes and smoke swirls=2C wi=
th the sounds inside or from outside coming in--
is of infinite variety and interest and spurs a million thoughts dreams rev=
eries memories ideas for works and --a sense of being in what i call deep t=
ime--
think how much has occurred with you just be finding this book!--
every instant such a plenitude it overflows and yet is also succeeded buy a=
 new instant which may be uncannily familiar--as=2C with the book=2C your o=
wn forgotten memories voluntary and involuntarily arise and are seen heard =
smelled felt experienced thought of in ways never to have happened to you b=
efore--
i realize this al sounds perhaps trite=2C cliched=2C outworn as the hand of=
 a dead man one plays card with and even deals the "dead man's card " to--a=
n event of my own "real life" which has been transposed into one of my "sto=
ries" (in an issue of Otolith--)
i apologize as the events themselves are not trite--the fault is with my wo=
rds in essaying the expression--
i often think that one does not "die" completely as so much of others lives=
 inside oneself--by these i mean the presence of the ancestors for me is ve=
ry powerful--and the thought of al those generations come--already my own c=
hildren having children while my youngest is barely older than the grandchi=
ld is-
since i was very young i had a very powerful sense of the ancestors--i have=
 no idea why and it seems --one of those powerful events within one like a =
geologic sense of being-
sometimes down by the Lake i can feel the ancestors stirring and when i go =
out into the woods i hear them moving about--
my mom recently was in Quebec City to visit my brother who lives there--and=
 they rented a car and drove far north to the rezervation where our family =
originally came from=2C the area around there--
who knows how many tens of thousands of years they have been in this contin=
ent=2C in that part of the world--and=2C gradually through time=2C expanded=
 al the way est over 1=2C800 miles in Canada and in areas of northen minnes=
ota and wisconsin--
most of them were genocide--and the intermarried french-indians ethnically =
cleansed=2C driven into the usa--my grandfather was the first of his family=
 since 1650 to be born outside of quebec=2C and the first of two generation=
s not to intermarry with Indians--i took up the thread and blood myself and=
 married a Mohawk
genocided--at one point by infected blankets given them when loaded onto fr=
eight trains being shipped in to the night never to return=2C yet i feel th=
ey never left=2C they wil always remain-
so itia great honor to feel part of this continuous group of persons=2C as =
strange to oneself as oneself is and also in other ways uncannily familiar-
in this sense=2C death is only apart of an ongoing life that one fears to e=
nd=2C to be final=2C yet which is not--
i dont want to "die" anymore than yourself--
yet--in one's work and in so many other ways as with the book you found=2C =
one lives on--

as some "find" at another time for a person at once strange and familiar--
thank you again for the beauty of your letter-
and always=2C for your work and example--

Francis,

I'm interested in writing reviews of short films. Are there any online
viewing resources that you particularly favor and recommend?

Write for the second, since the second includes the first.
But I'd say "anyone" who reads it.

I don't understand the question; why is there a "should" here? Different
people write for different reasons. I don't think there's much more to
say...

This poet writes for himself. Does truth require an audience?

Like Alan, i don't understand the "should"--other than in such "extenuating
circumstances"  as in cases of the coerced, of desperation, of fear or
perhaps the obscurely shifted desire to "do the right thing" in some
inwardly confused sense of "moral duty" or "moral suasion."

Or--in the cases of propaganda and advertising.

A Ruyssian artist writes that language is a fascism not becuase it silences
or censros, but because it forces one to speak.

Such would be the case of the "should" perhaps--

A writer writes for those who read, who in turn may read for those who do
not read.

A writer writes--for whom?  Oneself and other strangers?

I've made poems written for stones, tree, the air, a ray of light--without
even the idea of a person involved--

In this sense one may write for those "illiterates" or "inanimates"  who do
not read yet understand and know the Unwritten--



"The hills know but do not tell" as Emily Dickinson writes--

Hi Alan, David,

Here is a quote from my review of Ed Foster's book of poems *What He Ought
To Know*:

"For Ed Foster. Spicer=92s comment, =93no one listens to poetry,=94 is at t=
he
heart of a poetic revolution. He transforms this existential condition into
Walter Benjamin=92s suggestion that poetry listens to no one: =93Art... pos=
its
man=92s physical and spiritual existence, but in none of its works is it
concerned with his response. No poem is intended for the reader, no picture
for the beholder, no symphony for the listener.=94 This quotation appears i=
n
Foster=92s poem, =93Poetry Has Nothing To Do With Politics.=94 More than a =
denial
of politics, the idea in the title is an assertion of the independent,
accidental, chaotic power, of poetry."

Ciao,

Murat

Notice that Gerald (whom I don't know but have just called by first name)
makes the caveat:

       "Should a poet, *if confronted with a choice*, write a piece for
other poets who
       read poetry or write for an audience of everyone who will read it?"
(emphasis mine)

If I understand the question correctly, then all the previous comments
certainly apply to what we might call its "weak version" (without caveat).
People probably do generally just write for themselves and their own
(private) reasons. That's  the trouble with intentionality (in the broad
sense) and part of the three F's of lit crit -- fun, fodder and folly. But *if
confronted with a choice* implies that the individual may be unconscious of
the audiences that they're writing to prior to knowing that such a choice
can be made. When one can hold a mental state like [shall I write poem/s
(Px) for audience of poets (Ap), or write poem/s (Pn) for the set of all
readers (Ar)], it is an ethical choice and thus demands a "should" iff you
think people who write poems can choose to write poem *for* particular
audiences to read -- again, the intentionality problem -- and whether you
think acts of reading are holistic as regards access to the intentional
attitudes of the author (which may change with each given reader-instance,
and possibly even every time slice).

For my part, I'd say that the answer would requires three individuated
premises at least: (a.) whether or not the mental states I attempted to
describe above can make any sense as regards writing a poem (or anything
else for that matter); and (b). what conditions of satisfaction supervene on
the mental representations POEM/S, POET/S, AUDIENCE and READERS in the cases
of all possible people who might write poems for either other poets or the
set of all possible readers. If these questions don't make any sense to ask,
then there's no point in asking the ethical question, because we won't have
a grounds for mental causation. Unless, again, we think the set of all
possible readers have an atomistic disposition in their access toward the
intentional attitudes of the author, or that  that authors never can
possibly write for anything.

I think that the answer to the ethical question depends on what stage of
their development in writing poems the writer in question is at, as well as
what goals that individual has for their writing. In either case, career
decisions for the immediate and what winds up anthologized or otherwise
preserved are two separate things, as are readers' mental operations and
experience of the piece(s) in question. But the question itself "Should a
poet..." implies that one formulate (constantly) the ethic, continue to
wrestle with the question. If we have an answer that we refuse to budge,
what texts do we then deny existence? And what consequence lies in that?

I also want to point out, for whatever it's worth, that the names seem to
suggest this conversation is male-dominated. What importance, if any, does
that bear in considering the question?

it's a quantity/ quality thing.
some very prolific poets are not terribly consistent.
Creeley had his ruts.
The Buk was often simply drunk, gazing at his navel, but stuck at the typwriter.

No. Because not everyone is great.
Especially now.
Consistent greatness belongs to past, coherent cultures.

Ashbery is consisent, but only great, or near great when he gets off a good long poem and avoids the same old  goofiness.
Frederick Seidel started out very good in a R Lowell sort of way and has become damn near great whenever he does poem.

and held the first one at the National Archives of Canada..." Spyker moved

The more I read of how this book came to be (I started with the Gurlesque a=
nthology first), the more invested I become.  My opinions are taking shape,=
 and yet, only a few, especially Danielle Pafunda primarily, join me in dis=
cussing what is beginning to feel like "my issue" --  I invite you to join =
the discussion (to whet your interest, my last response, from the comments =
thread, to Danielle is pasted below) -- http://amyking.wordpress.com/2010/0=
3/22/my-visceral-thought/ Thanks, Amy Good morning, Danielle! Okay, I=E2=80=
=99m going to try to make my contention clearer.  Let=E2=80=99s start with =
a Glenum quote from Johannes blog: =E2=80=9CAnd Riot Grrr.  Think zombified=
 Courtney Love in her babydoll nightie, who somehow managed able to make fe=
male nudity threatening and aggressive rather than erotic.=E2=80=9D   Two a=
necdotes now & then my explanation in relation to the Gurlesque anthology: =
I loved Love=E2=80=99s music.  Once, I was at one of her shows, pretty inti=
mate, maybe a hundred
 people or so.  (Drew Barrymore was even there, backstage, taking care of F=
rancis Bean)  Love rocked out; she spoke aggressively, wore her babydoll dr=
ess, combat boots, said lots of pro-women things, etc.  Late in the show, s=
he decided to stage dive, just like any guy singer would who could feel the=
 energy from the crowd.  But this crowd, especially the pit-as-usual, was m=
ore than half guys.  And when she got carried across that pit, those men be=
gan ripping her clothes, feeling her up, etc.  It was all security could do=
 to get her back, a total struggle.  Onstage again, she was pissed, frustra=
ted, and could only scream into the mic angrily, =E2=80=9CI test every crow=
d in every city, and you FAILED!=E2=80=9D and stormed off stage.  For all o=
f her aggression, all of her posturing, all of her proclamations, her nudit=
y was *not* threatening, as Glenum claims; she remained most certainly an e=
rotic object to grab and fuck and disrespect. I've never seen a man experie=
nce a
 stage dive even remotely similar. Moving on to Tribe 8, Riot Grrrl band ma=
de up of all openly-queer women.  This was one of the first shows to shock =
me.  These women got on stage, they had hot bods that fit =E2=80=98sexy=E2=
=80=99 stereotypes.  Several of them took off their shirts and began rockin=
g out.  Many of the men didn=E2=80=99t know what the fuck to do.  They just=
 gaped, though some got into the music, moshing a bit, especially as the sh=
ock wore off and the show went on.  More women were in the pit than usual t=
oo.  But the initial problem for the men and those of us attuned to seeing =
women through the male gaze, despite the hardcore energy of the music (whic=
h is what we presumably paid for), was that these women became grotesque, t=
hey were parodies incarnate because these were women=E2=80=99s bodies with =
true bare breasts, those sexy orbs (the site of symbolic sex/sexiness), att=
ached to real monsters:  women who were publicly queer and therefore by def=
ault anomalies,
 performing this killer music but not as a site for masturbation or fucking=
. They were truly threatening, scary and not to be fucked with.   Not one g=
uy tried to touch them, though I=E2=80=99m sure a few had trouble processin=
g/reconciling that female nudity with being there to rock out.  Glenum and =
Greenberg say they=E2=80=99re =E2=80=9Cdescribing what they=E2=80=99ve seen=
=E2=80=9D, but based on the anthology, they seem to have only seen hetero-w=
omen performing gender in grotesque/hybrid/paradoxical ways.  Even if they =
didn=E2=80=99t try to seek out the work of queer women, I know that Glenum =
is aware of Dodie Bellamy=E2=80=99s poetry, which would lead one to imagine=
 that, even if they didn=E2=80=99t include Bellamy=E2=80=99s work, they wou=
ld have made a conscious attempt to seek out and include work by queer-iden=
tified women that includes representations/perspectives of queer women, esp=
ecially as sites of resistance /grotesqueness / parody =E2=80=93 not just h=
etero-women and girls in the making.   The =E2=80=9Cqueer
 woman=E2=80=9D certainly falls under the category of =E2=80=9Crepresentati=
ons of women=E2=80=9D in the public eye that Glenum and Greenberg define th=
e anthology by. To omit any work of this sort from this anthology is not on=
ly a glaring omission, it=E2=80=99s exclusionary and does a disservice to t=
he project of the Gurlesque; the anthology narrows the Gurlesque at great c=
ost.  Considering that the kind of performance the editors describe has lon=
g been the staple, almost inherently necessary work of a queer woman as soo=
n as she owns her queerness out loud, it=E2=80=99s shocking to exclude any =
work by those women.  I mean, Glenum founds the basis of her definition on =
Judith Butler, who obviously =E2=80=9Cdescribed=E2=80=9D gender as performa=
nce =E2=80=93 & it=E2=80=99s no coincidence that the first theorist to publ=
icly introduce that concept was a lesbian.   To make a poor parallel, this =
anthology would be akin to editing an anthology of Experimental American Po=
etries and only including selections by
 Language Poets or Black Mountain poets.  You can say it=E2=80=99s =E2=80=
=9Cdescriptive=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Conly=E2=80=9D what you =E2=80=9Cnotice=
d=E2=80=9D all you want, but the editors of such an anthology must have bee=
n wearing blinders if that=E2=80=99s all they include. I remain frustrated =
because the more I read from discussions online, the more I see that Glenum=
 keeps conjuring =E2=80=9Cqueerness=E2=80=9D and Greenberg claims to have =
=E2=80=9Ccoined=E2=80=9D the term =E2=80=9CGurlesque=E2=80=9D while also al=
igning it with Riot Grrrl, but to see no inclusion of the queer roots of su=
ch performance, to not acknowledge the ongoing work of confounding the noti=
on of =E2=80=9Cwoman=E2=80=9D via queer perversion / queer women=E2=80=99s =
burlesque =E2=80=93 gurlesque is incredible.   They may as well mark the ex=
clusiveness of this project as defined/narrowed through this anthology and =
say =E2=80=9Cqueering the hetero-woman and girl concept by hetero-women=E2=
=80=9D, which really only smacks of efforts to subvert, not =E2=80=9Cqueer=
=E2=80=9D when you don=E2=80=99t actually include the queer.=20
  Just one more note and I=E2=80=99ll stop, let my frustration go the way o=
f the mostly-silence on this issue:  A whole lot happens when a queer woman=
 frustrates the male gaze that inspires a very different awareness, which e=
merges over time for queer women.  This awareness births ideas and performa=
nces that are certainly co-opted and appropriated by hetero-women, and that=
=E2=80=99s absolutely fine.  From the most basic of signifiers like dykes w=
earing combat boots and punking out/shearing their hair to larger behaviors=
 that I will not go into right now, we have created and given permissions t=
hat may not have happened for a long time for straight women.  I=E2=80=99m =
not trying to own all of the subversive stuff straight women have tried on =
or done for themselves, at all.  But I haven=E2=80=99t read anything in all=
 of Glenum=E2=80=99s and Greenberg=E2=80=99s descriptions that queer women =
as poets, performers, mothers, etc, haven=E2=80=99t also been doing/dealing=
 with and adding to the
 conversation/culture.   Just yesterday, a guy didn=E2=80=99t like what I h=
ad to say about Bukowski on a friggin=E2=80=99 throw-away Facebook post and=
, knowing I=E2=80=99m queer, told me to get my =E2=80=9Chead out of my cunt=
=E2=80=9D, made lewd claims about my relations with my =E2=80=9Cpartner=E2=
=80=9D (his quotes) in an effort to delegitimize my relationship, and other=
 shit =E2=80=93 and that was only one tiny fraction of my experience with m=
en reacting to the queer grotesque monster woman that I am daily.  So yes, =
the queer existence does have a leg up experientially when it comes to unde=
rstanding what it means to perform for that male gaze while simultaneously =
and paradoxically excising one=E2=80=99s self from it just by default of pr=
imarily loving and being for and in relation to women =E2=80=93 and that ki=
nd of performance certainly does make its way into queer women=E2=80=99s po=
etry.  I just can=E2=80=99t believe these editors, two smart well-versed an=
d theoretically-inclined women, didn=E2=80=99t come across any writing
 that fit that bill or give a single nod to it, though they unabashedly hav=
e no problem referencing the type of work queer women have historically don=
e and continue to do.   Here, have some poems by Julian Brolaski and tell m=
e how these don=E2=80=99t fit the Gurlesque - http://chax.org/eoagh/issue3/=
issuethree/brolaski.html Or Brenda Iijima and Stacy Szymaszek -- http://cha=
x.org/eoagh/issue3/issuethree/bracyiimaszek.html Or any number of queer poe=
ts I don=E2=80=99t have time right now to sift through but would have if I =
were an editor of an anthology such as this=E2=80=A6 Sorry to be insistent;=
 I=E2=80=99m still just emotional and pissed.  But moreover, I appreciate y=
our bravery and how constructively you continue to engage me on this matter=
, Danielle =E2=80=93 I know you=E2=80=99re tons busy!   I think you hit the=
 nail on the head in your efforts in the last comment to note / outline wha=

It was Village Voice photographer Fred McDarrah who conceived of the
rent-a-beatnik idea and sent friends like Joans out to be rented.
McDarrah's the photographer responsible for many iconic images of the
day, including Kerouac during a rdg, arm's stretched out like Jesus;
Dylan sitting on a Sheridan Square bench and saluting; Abbie Hoffman
in his American flag shirt, among so many others. His photos were
compiled in books like The Beat Scene, Beat Generation: Glory Days in
Greenwich Village, and Gay Pride: Photographs from Stonewall to Today.
Here's a link to his obit in the Voice, with links there, and below,
to some of his photos:

well, dead poets have written poems and we read their poems to others --

& yes, we should write for "an audience of everyone" who reads.

A Similar But Different Quality Magazine Reading

A Similar But Different Quality is an experimental text-based journal
unspecific to any genre. The sole parameter is that the work is text, which
opens us to the surprise and poetry of language that is everywhere.
Published occasionally, their manifesto reads:

Accidents. Words are everywhere and inevitably beautiful. What tries to be
poetic is often not because true poetry is an accident. The poetry genre is
paradoxically unpoetic, too narrow to contain the full beauty of language
that permeates everyday conversation, movie dialogue, graffiti, theatre,
song lyrics, notes, diary entries, grocery lists, receipts, rap, text
messages, emails, spam, tweets, etc, etc. To poetry without boundaries,
except the words. Not poetry, but words. To an immediate, unpretentious and
zesty poetry.

=5Fthe Alphabet=5F: A Symposium on Ron Silliman's Long Poem

25-26 March 2011
University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, Canada

"I'm not writing for 'a small circle of friends,' I'm writing to you."

After three decades of composition, Ron Silliman's =5Fthe Alphabet=5F is=20
complete, and published under one cover (University of Alabama Press,=20
2008). When this twenty-six-sectioned, thousand-plus-page poem was only=20
available in discrete portions, in magazines, chapbooks, limited-run=20
books, what punctuated each was not the poem's next "new sentence" but=20
concurrent claims and counterclaims on contemporary life. =5Fthe Alphabet=
=5F=20
was written during decades when high theory and cultural studies had=20
arrived in the academy to exact formal and mostly progressive social=20
evaluations from culture and the arts, but still often at the expense of=20
poetry's own theoretical challenges to the academy's institutional base;=20
when intensified corporate consolidation of the mass media and new=20
technologies were transforming existing paradigms of "the consumer=20
society" (Baudrillard), its "captains of consciousness" (Ewen), and=20
"culture of narcissism" (Lasch); and when, among other factors,=20
manufactured consent (theorized equally by Burawoy for factory work as by=20
Chomsky and Herman for mass media) propelled the US mainstream rightwards=20
into postmodern politics. Specific responses to claims by these dominant=20
narratives (to pick just three) from the post-Vietnam War era are to be=20
found among poets associated with Language Poetry (a label in part=20
projected from such narratives) and other contemporaneous groupings and=20
tendencies. But even in a given contextual and interpretive frame such as=20
this one, loose and incomplete as it is in this version but in which some=20
idea of ideological mediation prevails, how is it that one thing =5Fthe=20
Alphabet=5F does is embody perceptions of a sensible world ("the way old gu=
m=20
leaves its spotted shadow on the cement"), which is a poetic task much=20
older than and yet foundational to "the ideology of the aesthetic" (in=20
Eagleton's title phrase)? I offer this long-debated question of art's=20
function - "to strengthen the perceptive faculties and free them from=20
encumbrance" (to quote Pound on Dante, from almost a century ago) - as an=20
example of how =5Fthe Alphabet=5F's singularities and influences may=20
re-illuminate received verities regarding the politics of aesthetic forms=20
in Language Poetry's milieu. Put another way, once timely and key=20
discursive interventions associated with Silliman's name and context -=20
such as use of theory in poetry, "ethnography" of the everyday, critiques=20
of accessible communication modes and of speech-based subjectivization,=20
poetics of ideological mediation - may require further elaboration, or=20
rethinking, if not their significance re-calibrated, in the face of this=20
poem's challenges. For, arguably, Silliman's reputation, even notoriety,=20
as critic, theorist, exponent of poetry's production as a socially=20
relevant and collective act, has preceded and to a degree guided how the=20
poetry is to be received. But if a reader responds to the poetry, then how =

and what does she or he see and hear? "I'm writing to you," the text says=20
in the section called "Lit." So, what is reading =5Fthe Alphabet=5F "like,"=
=20
for you?

This symposium aims to invite readings of Ron Silliman's long poem, =5Fthe =

Alphabet=5F, and encourages critical engagements with its formal and=20
socio-historical/-ideological dynamics as well as with its contexts and=20
interpretive frames that have accrued around the author's time and work.=20
Papers on any issue focussed on or around =5Fthe Alphabet=5F or an aspect=20

Gaze, by Marthe Reed, Black Radish Books,  2010:
About Gaze:
In the de-stabilized intersection of fashion, the war on terror, and
cultural constructions of the feminine, Gaze explores the resulting
tensions in a series of dichotomies central to an increasingly isolate
and adversarial condition: Christianity/Islam, ancient/modern,
sacred/secular, sexuality/spirituality, feminism/fundamentalism,
power/resistance, self/other. Rikki Ducornet says this about these
intersections in Gaze: =93In these moments the world is given breath,
heat, and voice. All at once it approaches, and the beloved's
unfettered body is revealed as the antidote to tyranny.=94 What we see
and what we fail to see are constantly juxtaposed, exposing a flawed
desire to =93become.=94  Kate Bernheimer says of Gaze, =93Too beautiful to
articulate=92=97dressed, undressed, terrorized, and entrancing.  These
unveilings, these poems, how they haunt me. Riding Angela Carter on a
poetry-horse, Reed hallucinates language with certain and dissolving
rhythm. Gaze at them; go blind inside this mentalist=92s mind. Marthe
Reed is unrelenting, unrelentingly kind.=94


Occultations, by David Wolach, Black Radish Books,  2010:
About Occultations:
Employing an array of contemporary poetic strategies (somatics,
enactment, procedural interference, abject lyric, ritual, affiliative
appropriation), Occultations asks us to consider how the body's mortal
we...might live its demise. To ask, "why do you hesitate at the
covered parts?" is to pose the question of an ethics of the
senses...David Wolach's experiments extend this exploration precisely
through their variance: in these poems, speech, sex, war and
militarism, domestic space, collectively, protest--not ghosted, not as
representation, but as locational probabilities, as motional
frameworks.--Laura Elrick


Tomorrowland, by Lisa Samuels., Shearsman, 2009
About Tomorrowland:
Tomorrowland is a book-length poem of bodily transit and colonial
forgetting. Its names and events perpetually arrive in a new world,
whose versions here combine promised lands and historical suicide.
Eula moves among these real and imagined place-times with other
symbolic names and unnamed figures, and Jack plays death. The primary
formal note is the interrupted iambic.

Lisa Samuels' Tomorrowland is a guidebook and diary from an actuality
existing among real sea and ships and coastline, history, and
contemporary reflection. There are named =93characters,=94 but the true
characters are a colony, a =93we=94 of the newly arrived to this land. The
generous and graceful syntax is a fusing agent for yesterday, today,
and tomorrow. The reader exults in the accomplishment of the verse.

Porter2


Not that you listened to porter.mp3, but it did split a nail, messing up
my play. I taped on a saz pick, alternating finger styles. Anyway this is
a pretty cool piece, makes me want to drive across the country again.
I'd slam into every right-wing militia in sight. I wouldn't care if it
made sense. Then I thought maybe I should use exclamation marks here but
decided against it. The oud's unsweetened, just as it came through the
amp. I wasn't going to do another porter piece but I thought, well this is
a followup to the first since I messed up my play and Desiree made it all
better:

http://www.alansondheim.org/porter2.mp3

Desiree was punctual to a minute. The porter, the garcons, the porterai
avec pour toujours! offices, too, were to be performed by the wife of the
porter, according to little Nathalie, the porter's daughter, remaining
with her grandmother The sou was given, and the porter's daughter
disappeared, leaving the porter's daughter, and she went forth to dispose
of this: "The night Madame de la R******* died, the wife of the porter,
she had sex with minors, who said?" And all the reporters were looking at
her poverty, soon divulged to the porteress: To porterage, -- 00.00 1/4:
To porterage, -- 00.00 1/4: - after he signed the cheque that was to pay
the importer. I overheard he's played recently, this reporter can only
surmise. "The eternal gates' terrific porter lifted the northern Bar-
Imperial - supporter of the empire. For she was The Supporter of All or
One Who Remains Alive even after Everything, and he is like one who tries
to reform that matter, those false porters and trekking guides carrying
out at one sweep the whole arsenal of the old law.

Thanks everyone,
Jacket magazine has assigned reviewers for Tomorrowland and Occultations.

If you'd like to review Gaze (see below) just email me for details
p.brown62@gmail.com


Gaze, by Marthe Reed, Black Radish Books,  2010:
About Gaze

In the de-stabilized intersection of fashion, the war on terror, and
cultural constructions of the feminine, Gaze explores the resulting
tensions in a series of dichotomies central to an increasingly isolate
and adversarial condition: Christianity/Islam, ancient/modern,
sacred/secular, sexuality/spirituality, feminism/fundamentalism,
power/resistance, self/other. Rikki Ducornet says this about these
intersections in Gaze: =93In these moments the world is given breath,
heat, and voice. All at once it approaches, and the beloved's
unfettered body is revealed as the antidote to tyranny.=94 What we see
and what we fail to see are constantly juxtaposed, exposing a flawed
desire to =93become.=94  Kate Bernheimer says of Gaze, =93Too beautiful to
articulate=92=97dressed, undressed, terrorized, and entrancing.  These
unveilings, these poems, how they haunt me. Riding Angela Carter on a
poetry-horse, Reed hallucinates language with certain and dissolving
rhythm. Gaze at them; go blind inside this mentalist=92s mind. Marthe
Reed is unrelenting, unrelentingly kind.=94

Thanks again,
Pam

Saudi woman blasts clerics in TV contest poem

Saudi poet Hessa Hilal lashed out at hard-line clerics' religious edicts in=
 verse on live TV at a popular Arabic version of "American Idol."

Dubai: It was a startling voice of protest at a startling venue. Covered he=
ad-to-toe in black=2C a Saudi woman lashed out at hard-line Muslim clerics'=
 harsh religious edicts in verse on live TV at a popular Arabic version of =
"American Idol."
=20
Well=2C not quite "American Idol": Contestants compete not in singing but i=
n traditional Arabic poetry. Over the past episodes=2C poets sitting on an =
elaborate stage before a live audience have recited odes to the beauty of B=
edouin life and the glories of their rulers or mourning the gap between ric=
h and poor.
=20
Then last week=2C Hessa Hilal=2C only her eyes visible through her veil=2C =
delivered a blistering poem against Muslim preachers "who sit in the positi=
on of power" but are "frightening" people with their fatwas=2C or religious=
 edicts=2C and "preying like a wolf" on those seeking peace.
=20
Her poem got loud cheers from the audience and won her a place in the compe=
tition's finals=2C to be aired on Wednesday.
=20
It also brought her death threats=2C posted on several Islamic militant web=
 sites.

Hessa shrugs off the controversy.
=20
"My poetry has always been provocative=2C" she told The Associated Press in=
 an interview. "It's a way to express myself and give voice to Arab women=
=2C silenced by those who have hijacked our culture and our religion."
=20
Her poem was seen as a response to Shaikh Abdul Rahman Al Barrak=2C a promi=
nent cleric in Saudi Arabia who recently issued a fatwa saying those who ca=
ll for the mingling of men and women should be considered infidels=2C punis=
hable by death.
=20
But more broadly=2C it was seen as addressing any of many hard-line clerics=
 in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the region who hold a wide influence thro=
ugh television programmes=2C university positions or web sites.
"Killing a human being is so easy for them=2C it is always an option=2C" sh=
e told the AP.

Poetry holds a prominent place in Arab culture=2C and some poets in the Mid=
dle East have a fan base akin to those of rock stars.
=20
The programme=2C The Million's Poet=2C is a chance for poets to show off th=
eir original work=2C airing live weekly on satellite television across the =
Arab world from Abu Dhabi=2C capital of the United Arab Emirates.
=20
Contestants are graded on voice and style of recitation=2C but also on thei=
r subject matter=2C said Sultan Al Amimi=2C one of the three judges on the =
show and a manager of Abu Dhabi's Poetry Academy.
=20
Hilal's 15-verse poem was in a form known as Nabati=2C native to nomadic tr=
ibes of the Arabian Peninsula. She criticised extremism that she told AP is=
 "creeping into our society" through fatwas.
=20
"I have seen evil in the eyes of fatwas=2C at a time when the permitted is =
being twisted into the forbidden=2C" she said in the poem. She called such =
edicts "a monster that emerged from its hiding place" whenever "the veil is=
 lifted from the face of truth."
=20
She described hardline clerics as "vicious in voice=2C barbaric=2C angry an=
d blind=2C wearing death as a robe cinched with a belt=2C" in an apparent r=
eference to suicide bombers' explosives belts.
=20
The three judges gave her the highest marks for her performance=2C praising=
 her for addressing a controversial topic. That=2C plus voting from the 2=
=2C000 people in the audience and text messages from viewers=2C put her thr=
ough to the final round.
=20
"Hessa Hilal is a courageous poet=2C" said Al Amimi. "She expressed her opi=
nion against the kind of fatwas that affect people's lives and raised an al=
arm against these ad hoc fatwas coming from certain scholars who are inciti=
ng extremism."
=20
Fatwas are not legally binding and it is up to individual Muslims to follow=
 them. Clerics of all ideological stripes pronounced fatwas on nearly every=
 aspect of people's lives=2C from how they should deal with members of othe=
r religions to what they can watch on television.
=20
Hessa said she had heard about the death threats posted on Islamic extremis=
t Web sites and was concerned=2C but "not enough to send me into hiding."
=20
What's more on her mind is how sudden fame will change her quiet family lif=
e at home in the Saudi capital=2C Riyadh.
=20
"I worry how I will be perceived after the show is over=2C when judgment is=
 passed and people begin to talk about my performance and ideas=2C" said He=
ssa=2C a mother of four who has published poetry and previously was a poetr=
y editor at the Arab daily Al Hayat. "I worry the lights of fame will affec=
t my simple and quiet existence."
=20
The Million's Poet was launched in 2006 by the government's Abu Dhabi Autho=
rity for Culture and Heritage to encourage poetry.
=20
In this=2C the fourth season=2C 48 contestants from 12 Arab countries compe=
ted=2C including several women along with Hessa.
=20
On Wednesday=2C Hilal will be joined by five other poets in the final round=
. The winner of the $1.3 million grand prize will be declared a week later =
on March 31.
=20
Their topics are already known. One of Hessa's rivals will address terroris=
m. Another woman in the finals=2C Jaza Al Baqmi=2C will reflect on the role=
 of women.
=20
Hessa says her poem will tackle the media=2C but wouldn't elaborate so as n=
ot to spoil the surprise.
"My message to those who hear me is love=2C compassion and peace=2C" Hessa =
said. "We all have to share a small planet and we need to learn how to live=
 together."
=20
=20
=20
What do you think of this issue? Has the poet overstepped the line? Or do s=
uch acts promote dialogue? Join the debate...

Dear Murat:



On Wed, Mar 24, 2010 at 11:41 AM, David Chirot <david.chirot@gmail.com
>wrote:


 I've made poems written for stones, tree, the air, a ray of light--without
even the idea of a person involved--
 In this sense one may write for those "illiterates" or "inanimates" who do

"The hills know but do not tell" as Emily Dickinson writes=97

This ocean, humiliating in its disguises

Tougher than anything.

No one listens to poetry. The ocean

Does not mean to be listened to. A drop

Or crash of water. It means

Nothing.

It

Is bread and butter

Pepper and salt. The death

That young men hope for. Aimlessly

It pounds the shore. White and aimless signals. No

One listens to poetry.



Note: Spicer writes that =93no one listens to poetry.=94  He does NOT write=
 that
no one reads poetry.  After all, it takes reading his poem to know that he
wrote that no one listens to poetry . . . Are the poems only =93white and

by
some unknown =93aim=94=97=93Thing Language=94 as a =93thing to be read=94 w=
hen =93not
heard?=94=97

For the letters among Murat and myself quoted from here, see below this
present screed--

I am not playing devil=92s advocate here; as you know I am very much in
sympathy with what you write.  On the other hand, I think all too often
there is a too unquestioning welcoming of things which seem to prove the
values for which one may be in search of, o
r confident of, rather than a more open investigation into what it is that
is always already existing al around one, hidden in plain site, sight, cite=
.


The statements, quotes, you write are beautiful and in the best sense,
"noble." On the other hand, what you are writing of is based on a faith, an
assumption, that indeed what Spicer, Benjamin and you write is "true."

A point of view via the imagination is taken to be a "natural born fact,
Jack."

The ancient Romans had a saying that when an event occurs--one is to ask
oneself:  who benefits?
In Leonardo Sciascia's The Moro Affair, the author turns to Pasolini's
statement of investigation:  "The first symptoms are in the language."


You write:
"the idea in the title {=93 Poetry Has Nothing To Do With Politics=94} is a=
n
assertion of the independent,
accidental, chaotic power, of poetry."

Might one not ask:  how can an assertion such as =93Poetry Has Nothing To D=
o
With Politics =93be considered as having anything to do with "an independen=
t,
accidental, chaotic power, of poetry"?

Is the assertion =93Poetry Has Nothing To Do With Politics=94 by its rhetor=
ical
absolutism not in itself a denial of such independence, accidents, chaos,
while being at the same time very much an assertion of POWER?

Your statements, with the selected quotations denote a search for what
poetry does, means, its existential condition=97and so provides the
=93evidences=94 which support the search=97as a search implies=97it is a se=
arch for
something=97an answer, a Holy Grail=97a poem=97



Benjamin was a person on continual searches=97when he wrote with one search=
 in
mind he wrote in the manner of the quotation here.  Elsewhere, for example
when writing on Brecht (and/or under his influence) or the Surrealists, he
was asking the questions related to his search for an actual PROGRAM: as he
wrote: =93Communism politicizes aesthetics.=94 (As opposed to Fascism=92s
=93aestheticization of politics.=94)  In that context, the idea of a poetry
outside of politics would be an evidence of tacit approval for the
=93condition of things as they are, as they exist.=94  And, so, a poetry at=
 the
service of the status quo of existence. If one applied the ancient Roman=92=
s
question of =93who benefits,=94 would it not yield the same answer?  That s=
uch a
position benefits the status quo, the Power of the Status Quo?

Does your quotation from Benjamin actually mean, as you suggest, that
=93poetry listens to no one?  What gives Benjamin the particular, especial
Power to make this assertion as a truth? How does he presume to know whethe=
r
or not the work of art in itself cares or not about its reception? Aren=92t
you perhaps misreading the quotation as given here?  My reading of   =93but=
 in
none of its [Art=92s] works is it concerned with his [man=92s] response=94 =
is
that, not to be concerned with the response, does not mean a not listening,
but simply a not caring for what is heard as a response or not. That is, th=
e
response will have no effect on the poem whatsoever, as far as the poem is
=93concerned.=94  Might this not mean also that the poem DOES hear the resp=
onse
but simply thumbs its nose at it?

Might not Benjamin write a quite opposite response when he is writing of
Brecht for example, whose intended effects via the =93A effect=94 are desig=
ned
quite consciously and openly to effect a response, and one that opens the
spectator=92s mind to the particular point of view re man=92s condition tha=
t
Brecht is =93bearing the message of?=94


=93Art... posits
> man=92s physical and spiritual existence, but in none of its works is it
> concerned with his response. No poem is intended for the reader, no
picture
> for the beholder, no symphony for the listener.=94

Benjamin in some essays argues that there are Arts which are most certainly
intended to produce certain desired effects, whether they are Communist or
Fascist.  The question of =93anarchy,=94 let alone Anarchism, (not to menti=
on
=93Democracy,=94) is left out in favor of demonstrating the urgency of the
choice between the two opposing systems threatening to engulf hundreds of
millions of lives. Agit-prop, the work of Brecht=92s form of Theater, the
films of Eisenstein and Vertov=92s, Picasso=92s painting of =93Guernica,=94=
 the Nazi
attacks on =93decadence=94 in the arts, the Mussolini-Marinetti formulation=
s of
a Fascist Futurism, the Spanish Falange=92s ultra-reactionary conceptions o=
f a
State Holy/Holy State Art=97Benjamin was surrounded by works whose intentio=
ns
were anything but =93fugitive=94 as William Burroughs calls the
glossary-resisting languages of drug addicts. My point is that Benjamin
himself does not consistently participate in the hard core forms of
absolutism demonstrated by a title such as =93Poetry has nothing to do with
politics.=94



After all, if one truly thinks with =93an assertion of the independent,
accidental, chaotic power, of poetry" then it does not exist in Foster=92s
title, which is an absolutist and exclusionary one. An absolutist =93chaoti=
c
power,=94 is basically an oxymoron; if it is exclusionary of politics it  i=
s
then just as exclusionary of such forms of =93anti-political=94 assertions =
as
Murat=92s interpretation of Foster title is. Chaos is=97the INCLUSION of
=93both/and=94 rather than an exclusionary =93either/or=94: Chaos does not =
censor,
pick and choose, take one side over another=97Chaos is IMPROBABLITY. =93Un =
Coup
de des n=92abolira jamais le hazard,=94 yet speak with any gambler and very
often  =93chance had nothing to do with it.=94

 --That is the paradoxical nature of Chaos: that a single event can be
perceived, and is perceived, thus affecting its own actions, from such a
multiplicity of points that it can appear simultaneously to be  =93pure
hazard,=94 or =93Fate,=94 =93meant to be,=94 or =93the Will of the Individu=
al/God=94
asserting its  =93triumph in adversity=94 over =93out of control=94 situati=
ons, etc
etc. Poets employ imposed forms of =93Chance Operations=94 on various mater=
ials,
presenting the =93chance results=94 as demonstrations of =93impersonal=94 o=
r =93found=94
poetry. However, by the very construction of a =93Method of Operations=94 i=
n
limiting the quantity of data/material being worked with, is there not a
limit being set on the basically illimitable, and so-by ruling out a good
deal of what is actually =93chance operating?=94 The I Ching, for example,
deliberately limits the number of lines employed, so that a sense of order
arises out of the seeming Chaos and so demonstrates The Way to be taken in =
a
particular situation.

The key to =93an assertion of the independent, accidental, chaotic power, o=
f
poetry=94 might be for starters to eliminate the =93assertion.=94 =93Assert=
ion=94 in
such close provenance to the word =93power=94 reminds one that assertions a=
re
just that, assertions of a =93power=94 that Knows, or is Presumed to Know.=
=94  The
=93author=94 as =93authority=94 in other words, and, by being a poet, being=
 an
authority on Poetry and what it has or not to do with, what its intentions
and limits are.  Does poetry care that =93no one=94 listens to it?  Or is i=
t
only the poet who does? How does the poet even know if =93poetry=94 cares o=
r
not? Does a =93poem=94 or =93poetry=94 always do what the author/poet autho=
rizes,
what he or she intends it to do ?



Is not the assertion of =93the independent, accidental, power of, poetry=94=
  in
itself a political action, in that it is a =93declaration of independence=
=94
from something, and, in this case, specifically, from a Political Poetry?
How can an assertion of the =93accidental power of poetry=94 be made , as a=
n
assertion?  Is there not something in an assertion which rules out precisel=
y
the accidental possibilities, intentions, of the assertion? When one writes
of =93power=94 in any context, may it not be associated precisely with the =
power
of =93authority,=94 of Political power,=94 =93the Power of the Word,=94 the=
 power of
=93the author=94 and so remain well within the domain of am  encounter with
power in al its guises, political and not?

It has become an increasingly =93powerfully=94 argued position of power whi=
ch
has especially since the eve of the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq been
asserting that poetry has nothing to do with the political, that its =93pow=
er=94
lies elsewhere, perhaps not even in the poet=97or not even in the poem itse=
lf.
From one viewpoint, one might =93see this=94 as the assertion of an elitist
position =93above the mere fray=94 of the political and the rest of the =93=
bad
objects=94 which need not be claimed among those belonging to Poetry. If
poetry, then, is actually the =93independent, accidental, power, of
poetry=94=97might it not be just as independent of this taking of an apolit=
ical
stance as of a political?  If its truly accidental, might it not accidently
run into politics on its way to the non political poem? Of poetry as power,
might it not use its power  against anyone who makes such assertions as the
claim to know what the power of poetry is?

I think that when one makes such absolutist rhetorical statements about
poetry, it is well to recall that they are indeed rhetorical statements.
These are not statements of fact, but of belief, of a choice between what
the writer delineates as an =93either/or=94 rather than as a completely ope=
n
ended situation, in which poetry may be seen, heard, listened, written by,
for, with, to any one or no one, or by, to, with, for no one, any one, a on=
e
or  a few or some  or many and so on.  To assert that Poetry has =93nothing=
 to
do with politics=94 is to be kept in mind as the assertion of  a specific p=
oet
in a very specific time and place, and within the historical context of tha=
t
poet=92s nation, then=97now=97being at War on multiple fronts in the Middle=
 East,
Colombia and North Eastern Africa, as well as being torn apart by various
=93warring factions=94 within the nation, including, as the assertion makes
evident, within the nation=92s various poetries and poetics, poets and grou=
ps
of poets.

Since the eve of the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq, as well as during al
the time the Invasion and attempted occupation of Afghanistan and many othe=
r
countries, most recently Haiti, from some points of view=97it has become
popular to invoke the idea that poetry has nothing to do with the political=
.
Amiri Baraka has written that for some large segments of the poetry writing
community, especially among academic and academic-related poets and
poetries, this apolitical position may have to do with maintaining job
security in the face of an inquisitive and forceful Homeland Security.
 Certainly
as the times grow worse economically and culturally, such an assertion of a
poet=92s position might need to be more than ever emphasized=97after al a
self-proclaimed non political poet is likely to be far less trouble than
those speaking out about the conditions of the academy, or of students, or
of themselves or any other cause related to the academy or State.  Granted
that Amiri Baraka as a political poet will take a political view of those
professing to be non-political, there is always the =93probability,=94 sinc=
e he
is also a poet, of his viewpoint being as much of a =93poetic=94 one as any
other poet=92s. Whether one agrees or disagrees with his position=97does it=
 not
involve one with politics at least in order to deny one=92s involvement in =
it?

I like very much Murat=92s expression =93the independent,
accidental, chaotic power, of poetry;=94 I think for myself the difficulty
with it arises with in the context it is expressed in: that of assertions,
of quotations from =93authorities=94 and so forth. That is, this manner of
contextualizing such =93independent, accidental, chaotic power, of poetry=
=94
basically denies the existence of al these elements by making of them an
=93either/or=94 statement of assertion, a taking of sides against inclusivi=
ty in
poetry, the denial of its power to behave out of the poet=92s control, out =
of
even its own control . . .



By imposing criteria, as I indicated earlier, one is attempting to control
the direction and elements of the discussion. By imposing criteria, one is
limiting what a poet, what a poem what a poetry and poetics may be. This is
because, I think, it has to do with the idea that a poet, a poem, a poetry,
a poetics, is involved with a seeking for something, even if that something
has nothing to do with readers, listeners, writers at all, it is still a
search for poetry as something which exists in such a such condition, of
which one can be at a certain point and level, sure. One has faith, then ,
that it exists, it must exist=97

For many years I have been working with and thinking on the Found, which is
something very often =96I would say nearly always in many ways though not
=93all=94 necessarily----independent, accidental and chaotic.  Picasso stat=
ed:
=93I do not seek, I find.=94  (Note he is speaking only for himself,  not
the  overall
run of artists, not making an assertion other than of his own and own
work--) The more I have worked with l, lived with, though on this little
phrase, the more profound I find it the more profound I see the gulf betwee=
n
the Search, the Seeker and the one who finds.  The latter is operating in
the area which Paul Celan writes of, in which =93Poetry no longer imposes
itself, but exposes itself.=94 One does not know what one may find, whether=
 by
accident, by being independent of preconceived images, ideas and dogmas, or
open wide to the actions and elements of that chaotic power not only of
poetry but of anything which one =93comes across,=94 meets in one=92s rando=
m,
destination-less,  =93wanderings about.=94

By the very accidental, independent, chaotic power of the Found, the poetry=
,
the poem exposing itself may be political, it might not be=97who knows? Is =
the
one who finds even a poet?  By which I mean does the one who finds impose
already the limits of the so called =93poetic=94 on what it finds exposed a=
s
=93poetry?=94 Is it not perhaps that poetry, a poem, might be speaking, wri=
ting,
al of the time=97and that it is not that no one listens to this or reads it=
,
it=92s that perhaps no one recognizes that is always already speaking,
writing, listening=97

--and in the great vanity of =93man=92s/woman=92s  response=94 or not, in h=
is/her
hearing or not, in the immense vanity of her/his=92s assertions=97or not=97=
these
very things ever ongoing al around one at every instant are being completel=
y
ignored=97not so much =93unheard, unseen, untouched=94 as simply=97rendered=
 deaf,
dumb and blind not to mention =93non-existent=94 but by the power of assert=
ions
regarding things which are truly Outside a human=92s control? Thus the
assertion that not only does no one listen to poetry, but  that poetry migh=
t
also be listening to no one=97a kind of cancelling out of negatives . . .
leaving one with the assertion of=97what?  A conflict? A drama? A void . . =
.
abhorred by Nature--

For myself, the assertion that poetry has nothing to do with politics is a
very political one, in that it is limiting what the action, the elements of
a poem, of poetry, of poetics is, it is limiting the actions by poets and
groups of poets as wel as depriving them of vast areas of elements of
materials to use. For myself, this is a deeply political act, for in denyin=
g
the politics of its political act, the assertion is beginning to use that
form of sophism one encounters non stop in the media, which has been used t=
o
drag a country into one War after another while its poets=92 rhetorics are
turned towards a critique of critiquing the conditions of poetry in the sam=
e
manner that the polices of the State critique and essay to make irrelevant
and non-existent any critique of its policies, increasingly dependent on a
language of erasure and denial, so that one wil not notice that the proud
election of a Black President means not the =93end to racism=94 in America =
any
more than it lessens the support for the world=92s one Apartheid State.  Th=
e
only way to juggle such contradictions as this nation=92s policies embody
daily, is to also make the assertion that, along with poetry, one has
nothing to do with politics. To deny the contradictions is to say that
things that are opposites are the same. War=3DPeace. Love =3DHate, etc  Wha=
t
does Poetry =3D then? Non-Politics, Non Poetry---???  Poetry=3DPoetry!!!!  =
Yet
who decides what Poetry is?



The greatest victory for the State is when no one and nothing has anything
to do with politics. =93Let them write poetry!!!=94=97as =93no one listens =
to it=94
and, perhaps, poetry does not listen to the poets either!

One might even find this situation developing:

*In a jerky and ferocious style, [Defoe's] essay argued that literature
should be written by non-literary people, just as politics should be and
indeed was being taken over by non-politicians, as (Defoe) was delighted to
observe. The corresponding revolution in writing, Defoe went on to say,
would, in a sense, abolish literature itself. When poetry is written by
non-poets and read by non-readers.*

This ocean, humiliating in its disguises

Tougher than anything.

No one listens to poetry. The ocean

Does not mean to be listened to. A drop

Or crash of water. It means

Nothing.

It

Is bread and butter

Pepper and salt. The death

That young men hope for. Aimlessly

It pounds the shore. White and aimless signals. No

One listens to poetry.

Saudi woman blasts clerics in TV contest poem

Saudi poet Hessa Hilal lashed out at hard-line clerics' religious edicts in=
 verse on live TV at a popular Arabic version of "American Idol."

AP
Published: 17:36 March 23, 2010

Dubai: It was a startling voice of protest at a startling venue. Covered he=
ad-to-toe in black, a Saudi woman lashed out at hard-line Muslim clerics' h=
arsh religious edicts in verse on live TV at a popular Arabic version of "A=
merican Idol."

Well, not quite "American Idol": Contestants compete not in singing but in =
traditional Arabic poetry. Over the past episodes, poets sitting on an elab=
orate stage before a live audience have recited odes to the beauty of Bedou=
in life and the glories of their rulers or mourning the gap between rich an=
d poor.

Then last week, Hessa Hilal, only her eyes visible through her veil, delive=
red a blistering poem against Muslim preachers "who sit in the position of =
power" but are "frightening" people with their fatwas, or religious edicts,=
 and "preying like a wolf" on those seeking peace.

Her poem got loud cheers from the audience and won her a place in the compe=
tition's finals, to be aired on Wednesday.

It also brought her death threats, posted on several Islamic militant web s=
ites.

Hessa shrugs off the controversy.

"My poetry has always been provocative," she told The Associated Press in a=
n interview. "It's a way to express myself and give voice to Arab women, si=
lenced by those who have hijacked our culture and our religion."

Her poem was seen as a response to Shaikh Abdul Rahman Al Barrak, a promine=
nt cleric in Saudi Arabia who recently issued a fatwa saying those who call=
 for the mingling of men and women should be considered infidels, punishabl=
e by death.

But more broadly, it was seen as addressing any of many hard-line clerics i=
n Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the region who hold a wide influence throug=
h television programmes, university positions or web sites.
"Killing a human being is so easy for them, it is always an option," she to=
ld the AP.

Poetry holds a prominent place in Arab culture, and some poets in the Middl=
e East have a fan base akin to those of rock stars.

The programme, The Million's Poet, is a chance for poets to show off their =
original work, airing live weekly on satellite television across the Arab w=
orld from Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates.

Contestants are graded on voice and style of recitation, but also on their =
subject matter, said Sultan Al Amimi, one of the three judges on the show a=
nd a manager of Abu Dhabi's Poetry Academy.

Hilal's 15-verse poem was in a form known as Nabati, native to nomadic trib=
es of the Arabian Peninsula. She criticised extremism that she told AP is "=
creeping into our society" through fatwas.

"I have seen evil in the eyes of fatwas, at a time when the permitted is be=
ing twisted into the forbidden," she said in the poem. She called such edic=
ts "a monster that emerged from its hiding place" whenever "the veil is lif=
ted from the face of truth."

She described hardline clerics as "vicious in voice, barbaric, angry and bl=
ind, wearing death as a robe cinched with a belt," in an apparent reference=
 to suicide bombers' explosives belts.

The three judges gave her the highest marks for her performance, praising h=
er for addressing a controversial topic. That, plus voting from the 2,000 p=
eople in the audience and text messages from viewers, put her through to th=
e final round.

"Hessa Hilal is a courageous poet," said Al Amimi. "She expressed her opini=
on against the kind of fatwas that affect people's lives and raised an alar=
m against these ad hoc fatwas coming from certain scholars who are inciting=
 extremism."

Fatwas are not legally binding and it is up to individual Muslims to follow=
 them. Clerics of all ideological stripes pronounced fatwas on nearly every=
 aspect of people's lives, from how they should deal with members of other =
religions to what they can watch on television.

Hessa said she had heard about the death threats posted on Islamic extremis=
t Web sites and was concerned, but "not enough to send me into hiding."

What's more on her mind is how sudden fame will change her quiet family lif=
e at home in the Saudi capital, Riyadh.

"I worry how I will be perceived after the show is over, when judgment is p=
assed and people begin to talk about my performance and ideas," said Hessa,=
 a mother of four who has published poetry and previously was a poetry edit=
or at the Arab daily Al Hayat. "I worry the lights of fame will affect my s=
imple and quiet existence."

The Million's Poet was launched in 2006 by the government's Abu Dhabi Autho=
rity for Culture and Heritage to encourage poetry.

In this, the fourth season, 48 contestants from 12 Arab countries competed,=
 including several women along with Hessa.

On Wednesday, Hilal will be joined by five other poets in the final round. =
The winner of the $1.3 million grand prize will be declared a week later on=
 March 31.

Their topics are already known. One of Hessa's rivals will address terroris=
m. Another woman in the finals, Jaza Al Baqmi, will reflect on the role of =
women.

Hessa says her poem will tackle the media, but wouldn't elaborate so as not=
 to spoil the surprise.
"My message to those who hear me is love, compassion and peace," Hessa said=
. "We all have to share a small planet and we need to learn how to live tog=
ether."



What do you think of this issue? Has the poet overstepped the line? Or do s=
uch acts promote dialogue? Join the debate...

I'm impressed that so many people care passionately about poetry -- let's
imagine a popular TV show where poets (dressed in Chadors!) recited their
poetry, and were judged by the poetry, not by all the externals of
"performing poetry."

"Ganick registers in their course the semiotic pulses of language--its
rhythms and teeming vocabularies--its isness, its thisness and itness, this
continuous unforming and forming of itself, spooling out across the verses.
It forms *here* by virtue of a linked idea or analogous theme; *there* through
correspondence of sound; again by ingesting the flotsam of brand-names and
truisms littering the landscape, for the nth time--unexpectedly--through
spans or lacunae of logic. We can imagine Thought staring through various
planes of language like planes of glass, turning them with and against each
other, rotating their intersecting transparencies, a cognitive kaleidoscope
dancing with the light that passes through it in its motion."

Alphapoetic meditation on the etymology of the English alphabet with
diagrams by the author.

Peter Lamborn Wilson=92s quick wit and poetic intelligence add
immeasurably to the small store of recent art and poetry (Mac Low,
Berman, Silliman, Bok, Johns, to name a few) celebrating or utilitizng
the lore and wonder of alphabetic writing. As with Mac Low and Berman
in particular, Wilson=92s focus is on the Hebrew alphabet, coterminous
with the Phoenician at the alphabet=92s beginnings: a meditation, visual
and verbal, on the shape, form, history, and praxis of the letters and
signs in question. The resultant Abecedarium, reads like poetry or
what we now take poetry to be: short and tight prose versets that
bring to life a world of lore and tradition, and by so doing, make it
new. A book to read again and again, and a lettristic delight.

=97Jerome Rothenberg


Abecedarium by Peter Lamborn WilsonThis remarkable lexicon explores
tensions between life in a world before the State and the emergence of
the alphabet, or the origin of the world as we purport to know it.
Amidst the reign and terror of nonsense, in a land where =91everything
is believable and nothing knowable,=92 Peter Lamborn Wilson=97at the peak
of his extraordinary power=97tutors us in the old ways in an offering of
both knowledge and wisdom.

Such a choice seems precluded by earlier (and I believe, more significant)
decisions concerning what poetry is and what its writing might be in one's
life. Of course this choice might be seen as a part of those earlier
decisions, though it is probably neither distinct or central.

To be distinct and significant, such a choice seems as though it would have
to have been an initial one or one very early in the process. I can imagine
it happening that way, but rarely. Or maybe only by beginning poets who are
thinking of a career, of how poetry might serve them.


Question # 4:

Should a poet, if confronted with a choice, write a piece for other poets
who
read poetry or write for an audience of everyone who will read it?

Saudi woman blasts clerics in TV contest poem

Saudi poet Hessa Hilal lashed out at hard-line clerics' religious edicts in=
 verse on live TV at a popular Arabic version of "American Idol."

AP
Published: 17:36 March 23, 2010
Reader comments (12)


Dubai: It was a startling voice of protest at a startling venue. Covered he=
ad-to-toe in black, a Saudi woman lashed out at hard-line Muslim clerics' h=
arsh religious edicts in verse on live TV at a popular Arabic version of "A=
merican Idol."

Well, not quite "American Idol": Contestants compete not in singing but in =
traditional Arabic poetry. Over the past episodes, poets sitting on an elab=
orate stage before a live audience have recited odes to the beauty of Bedou=
in life and the glories of their rulers or mourning the gap between rich an=
d poor.

Then last week, Hessa Hilal, only her eyes visible through her veil, delive=
red a blistering poem against Muslim preachers "who sit in the position of =
power" but are "frightening" people with their fatwas, or religious edicts,=
 and "preying like a wolf" on those seeking peace.

Her poem got loud cheers from the audience and won her a place in the compe=
tition's finals, to be aired on Wednesday.

It also brought her death threats, posted on several Islamic militant web s=
ites.

Hessa shrugs off the controversy.

"My poetry has always been provocative," she told The Associated Press in a=
n interview. "It's a way to express myself and give voice to Arab women, si=
lenced by those who have hijacked our culture and our religion."

Her poem was seen as a response to Shaikh Abdul Rahman Al Barrak, a promine=
nt cleric in Saudi Arabia who recently issued a fatwa saying those who call=
 for the mingling of men and women should be considered infidels, punishabl=
e by death.

But more broadly, it was seen as addressing any of many hard-line clerics i=
n Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the region who hold a wide influence throug=
h television programmes, university positions or web sites.
"Killing a human being is so easy for them, it is always an option," she to=
ld the AP.

Poetry holds a prominent place in Arab culture, and some poets in the Middl=
e East have a fan base akin to those of rock stars.

The programme, The Million's Poet, is a chance for poets to show off their =
original work, airing live weekly on satellite television across the Arab w=
orld from Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates.

Contestants are graded on voice and style of recitation, but also on their =
subject matter, said Sultan Al Amimi, one of the three judges on the show a=
nd a manager of Abu Dhabi's Poetry Academy.

Hilal's 15-verse poem was in a form known as Nabati, native to nomadic trib=
es of the Arabian Peninsula. She criticised extremism that she told AP is "=
creeping into our society" through fatwas.

"I have seen evil in the eyes of fatwas, at a time when the permitted is be=
ing twisted into the forbidden," she said in the poem. She called such edic=
ts "a monster that emerged from its hiding place" whenever "the veil is lif=
ted from the face of truth."

She described hardline clerics as "vicious in voice, barbaric, angry and bl=
ind, wearing death as a robe cinched with a belt," in an apparent reference=
 to suicide bombers' explosives belts.

The three judges gave her the highest marks for her performance, praising h=
er for addressing a controversial topic. That, plus voting from the 2,000 p=
eople in the audience and text messages from viewers, put her through to th=
e final round.

"Hessa Hilal is a courageous poet," said Al Amimi. "She expressed her opini=
on against the kind of fatwas that affect people's lives and raised an alar=
m against these ad hoc fatwas coming from certain scholars who are inciting=
 extremism."

Fatwas are not legally binding and it is up to individual Muslims to follow=
 them. Clerics of all ideological stripes pronounced fatwas on nearly every=
 aspect of people's lives, from how they should deal with members of other =
religions to what they can watch on television.

Hessa said she had heard about the death threats posted on Islamic extremis=
t Web sites and was concerned, but "not enough to send me into hiding."

What's more on her mind is how sudden fame will change her quiet family lif=
e at home in the Saudi capital, Riyadh.

"I worry how I will be perceived after the show is over, when judgment is p=
assed and people begin to talk about my performance and ideas," said Hessa,=
 a mother of four who has published poetry and previously was a poetry edit=
or at the Arab daily Al Hayat. "I worry the lights of fame will affect my s=
imple and quiet existence."

The Million's Poet was launched in 2006 by the government's Abu Dhabi Autho=
rity for Culture and Heritage to encourage poetry.

In this, the fourth season, 48 contestants from 12 Arab countries competed,=
 including several women along with Hessa.

On Wednesday, Hilal will be joined by five other poets in the final round. =
The winner of the $1.3 million grand prize will be declared a week later on=
 March 31.

Their topics are already known. One of Hessa's rivals will address terroris=
m. Another woman in the finals, Jaza Al Baqmi, will reflect on the role of =
women.

Hessa says her poem will tackle the media, but wouldn't elaborate so as not=
 to spoil the surprise.
"My message to those who hear me is love, compassion and peace," Hessa said=
. "We all have to share a small planet and we need to learn how to live tog=
ether."



What do you think of this issue? Has the poet overstepped the line? Or do s=
uch acts promote dialogue? Join the debate...

=C2=A0
By imposing criteria, as I indicated earlier, one is attempting to control
the direction and elements of the discussion. By imposing criteria, one is
limiting what a poet, what a poem what a poetry and poetics may be. This is
because, I think,=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 (what ???...)=C2=A0it has to do w=

For the letters among Murat and myself quoted from here, see below this
present screed--

I am not playing devil=E2=80=99s advocate here; as you know I am very much =
in
sympathy with what you write.=C2=A0 On the other hand, I think all too ofte=
n
there is a too unquestioning welcoming of things which seem to prove the
values for which one may be in search of, o
r confident of, rather than a more open investigation into what it is that
is always already existing al around one, hidden in plain site, sight, cite=
.


The statements, quotes, you write are beautiful and in the best sense,
"noble." On the other hand, what you are writing of is based on a faith, an
assumption, that indeed what Spicer, Benjamin and you write is "true."

A point of view via the imagination is taken to be a "natural born fact,
Jack."

The ancient Romans had a saying that when an event occurs--one is to ask
oneself:=C2=A0 who benefits?
In Leonardo Sciascia's The Moro Affair, the author turns to Pasolini's
statement of investigation:=C2=A0 "The first symptoms are in the language."


You write:
"the idea in the title {=E2=80=9C Poetry Has Nothing To Do With Politics=E2=
=80=9D} is an
assertion of the independent,
accidental, chaotic power, of poetry."

Might one not ask:=C2=A0 how can an assertion such as =E2=80=9CPoetry Has N=
othing To Do
With Politics =E2=80=9Cbe considered as having anything to do with "an inde=
pendent,
accidental, chaotic power, of poetry"?

Is the assertion =E2=80=9CPoetry Has Nothing To Do With Politics=E2=80=9D b=
y its rhetorical
absolutism not in itself a denial of such independence, accidents, chaos,
while being at the same time very much an assertion of POWER?

Your statements, with the selected quotations denote a search for what
poetry does, means, its existential condition=E2=80=94and so provides the
=E2=80=9Cevidences=E2=80=9D which support the search=E2=80=94as a search im=
plies=E2=80=94it is a search for
something=E2=80=94an answer, a Holy Grail=E2=80=94a poem=E2=80=94



Benjamin was a person on continual searches=E2=80=94when he wrote with one =
search in
mind he wrote in the manner of the quotation here.=C2=A0 Elsewhere, for exa=
mple
when writing on Brecht (and/or under his influence) or the Surrealists, he
was asking the questions related to his search for an actual PROGRAM: as he
wrote: =E2=80=9CCommunism politicizes aesthetics.=E2=80=9D (As opposed to F=
ascism=E2=80=99s
=E2=80=9Caestheticization of politics.=E2=80=9D)=C2=A0 In that context, the=
 idea of a poetry
outside of politics would be an evidence of tacit approval for the
=E2=80=9Ccondition of things as they are, as they exist.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0 And=
, so, a poetry at the
service of the status quo of existence. If one applied the ancient Roman=E2=
=80=99s
question of =E2=80=9Cwho benefits,=E2=80=9D would it not yield the same ans=
wer?=C2=A0 That such a
position benefits the status quo, the Power of the Status Quo?

Does your quotation from Benjamin actually mean, as you suggest, that
=E2=80=9Cpoetry listens to no one?=C2=A0 What gives Benjamin the particular=
, especial
Power to make this assertion as a truth? How does he presume to know whethe=
r
or not the work of art in itself cares or not about its reception? Aren=E2=

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=E2=80=9Cbut in
none of its [Art=E2=80=99s] works is it concerned with his [man=E2=80=99s] =
response=E2=80=9D is
that, not to be concerned with the response, does not mean a not listening,
but simply a not caring for what is heard as a response or not. That is, th=
e
response will have no effect on the poem whatsoever, as far as the poem is
=E2=80=9Cconcerned.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0 Might this not mean also that the poem D=
OES hear the response
but simply thumbs its nose at it?

Might not Benjamin write a quite opposite response when he is writing of
Brecht for example, whose intended effects via the =E2=80=9CA effect=E2=80=
=9D are designed
quite consciously and openly to effect a response, and one that opens the
spectator=E2=80=99s mind to the particular point of view re man=E2=80=99s c=
ondition that
Brecht is =E2=80=9Cbearing the message of?=E2=80=9D

Benjamin in some essays argues that there are Arts which are most certainly
intended to produce certain desired effects, whether they are Communist or
Fascist.=C2=A0 The question of =E2=80=9Canarchy,=E2=80=9D let alone Anarchi=
sm, (not to mention
=E2=80=9CDemocracy,=E2=80=9D) is left out in favor of demonstrating the urg=
ency of the
choice between the two opposing systems threatening to engulf hundreds of
millions of lives. Agit-prop, the work of Brecht=E2=80=99s form of Theater,=
 the
films of Eisenstein and Vertov=E2=80=99s, Picasso=E2=80=99s painting of =E2=
=80=9CGuernica,=E2=80=9D the Nazi
attacks on =E2=80=9Cdecadence=E2=80=9D in the arts, the Mussolini-Marinetti=
 formulations of
a Fascist Futurism, the Spanish Falange=E2=80=99s ultra-reactionary concept=
ions of a
State Holy/Holy State Art=E2=80=94Benjamin was surrounded by works whose in=
tentions
were anything but =E2=80=9Cfugitive=E2=80=9D as William Burroughs calls the
glossary-resisting languages of drug addicts. My point is that Benjamin
himself does not consistently participate in the hard core forms of
absolutism demonstrated by a title such as =E2=80=9CPoetry has nothing to d=
o with
politics.=E2=80=9D



After all, if one truly thinks with =E2=80=9Can assertion of the independen=
t,
accidental, chaotic power, of poetry" then it does not exist in Foster=E2=
=80=99s
title, which is an absolutist and exclusionary one. An absolutist =E2=80=9C=
chaotic
power,=E2=80=9D is basically an oxymoron; if it is exclusionary of politics=
 it=C2=A0 is
then just as exclusionary of such forms of =E2=80=9Canti-political=E2=80=9D=
 assertions as
Murat=E2=80=99s interpretation of Foster title is. Chaos is=E2=80=94the INC=
LUSION of

t of control=E2=80=9D situations, etc
etc. Poets employ imposed forms of =E2=80=9CChance Operations=E2=80=9D on v=
arious materials,
presenting the =E2=80=9Cchance results=E2=80=9D as demonstrations of =E2=80=
=9Cimpersonal=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cfound=E2=80=9D
poetry. However, by the very construction of a =E2=80=9CMethod of Operation=
s=E2=80=9D in
limiting the quantity of data/material being worked with, is there not a
limit being set on the basically illimitable, and so-by ruling out a good
deal of what is actually =E2=80=9Cchance operating?=E2=80=9D The I Ching, f=
or example,
deliberately limits the number of lines employed, so that a sense of order
arises out of the seeming Chaos and so demonstrates The Way to be taken in =
a
particular situation.

The key to =E2=80=9Can assertion of the independent, accidental, chaotic po=
wer, of
poetry=E2=80=9D might be for starters to eliminate the =E2=80=9Cassertion.=
=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CAssertion=E2=80=9D in
such close provenance to the word =E2=80=9Cpower=E2=80=9D reminds one that =
assertions are
just that, assertions of a =E2=80=9Cpower=E2=80=9D that Knows, or is Presum=
ed to Know.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0 The
=E2=80=9Cauthor=E2=80=9D as =E2=80=9Cauthority=E2=80=9D in other words, and=
, by being a poet, being an
authority on Poetry and what it has or not to do with, what its intentions
and limits are.=C2=A0 Does poetry care that =E2=80=9Cno one=E2=80=9D listen=
s to it?=C2=A0 Or is it
only the poet who does? How does the poet even know if =E2=80=9Cpoetry=E2=
=80=9D cares or
not? Does a =E2=80=9Cpoem=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cpoetry=E2=80=9D always do wh=
at the author/poet authorizes,
what he or she intends it to do ?



Is not the assertion of =E2=80=9Cthe independent, accidental, power of, poe=
try=E2=80=9D=C2=A0 in
itself a political action, in that it is a =E2=80=9Cdeclaration of independ=
ence=E2=80=9D
from something, and, in this case, specifically, from a Political Poetry?
How can an assertion of the =E2=80=9Caccidental power of poetry=E2=80=9D be=
 made , as an
assertion?=C2=A0 Is there not something in an assertion which rules out pre=
cisely
the accidental possibilities, intentions, of the assertion? When one writes
of =E2=80=9Cpower=E2=80=9D in any context, may it not be associated precise=
ly with the power
of =E2=80=9Cauthority,=E2=80=9D of Political power,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cthe P=
ower of the Word,=E2=80=9D the power of
=E2=80=9Cthe author=E2=80=9D and so remain well within the domain of am=C2=
=A0 encounter with
power in al its guises, political and not?

It has become an increasingly =E2=80=9Cpowerfully=E2=80=9D argued position =
of power which
has especially since the eve of the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq been
asserting that poetry has nothing to do with the political, that its =E2=80=
=9Cpower=E2=80=9D
lies elsewhere, perhaps not even in the poet=E2=80=94or not even in the poe=
m itself.
From one viewpoint, one might =E2=80=9Csee this=E2=80=9D as the assertion o=
f an elitist
position =E2=80=9Cabove the mere fray=E2=80=9D of the political and the res=
t of the =E2=80=9Cbad
objects=E2=80=9D which need not be claimed among those belonging to Poetry.=
 If
poetry, then, is actually the =E2=80=9Cindependent, accidental, power, of
poetry=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94might it not be just as independent of this taking =
of an apolitical
stance as of a political?=C2=A0 If its truly accidental, might it not accid=
ently
run into politics on its way to the non political poem? Of poetry as power,
might it not use its power=C2=A0 against anyone who makes such assertions a=
s the
claim to know what the power of poetry is?

I think that when one makes such absolutist rhetorical statements about
poetry, it is well to recall that they are indeed rhetorical statements.
These are not statements of fact, but of belief, of a choice between what
the writer delineates as an =E2=80=9Ceither/or=E2=80=9D rather than as a co=
mpletely open
ended situation, in which poetry may be seen, heard, listened, written by,
for, with, to any one or no one, or by, to, with, for no one, any one, a on=
e
or=C2=A0 a few or some=C2=A0 or many and so on.=C2=A0 To assert that Poetry=
 has =E2=80=9Cnothing to
do with politics=E2=80=9D is to be kept in mind as the assertion of=C2=A0 a=
 specific poet
in a very specific time and place, and within the historical context of tha=
t
poet=E2=80=99s nation, then=E2=80=94now=E2=80=94being at War on multiple fr=
onts in the Middle East,
Colombia and North Eastern Africa, as well as being torn apart by various
=E2=80=9Cwarring factions=E2=80=9D within the nation, including, as the ass=
ertion makes
evident, within the nation=E2=80=99s various poetries and poetics, poets an=
d groups
of poets.

Since the eve of the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq, as well as during al
the time the Invasion and attempted occupation of Afghanistan and many othe=
r
countries, most recently Haiti, from some points of view=E2=80=94it has bec=
ome
popular to invoke the idea that poetry has nothing to do with the political=
.
Amiri Baraka has written that for some large segments of the poetry writing
community, especially among academic and academic-related poets and
poetries, this apolitical position may have to do with maintaining job
security in the face of an inquisitive and forceful Homeland Security.
Certainly
as the times grow worse economically and culturally, such an assertion of a
poet=E2=80=99s position might need to be more than ever emphasized=E2=80=94=
after al a
self-proclaimed non political poet is likely to be far less trouble than
those speaking out about the conditions of the academy, or of students, or
of themselves or any other cause related to the academy or State.=C2=A0 Gra=
nted
that Amiri Baraka as a political poet will take a political view of those
professing to be non-political, there is always the =E2=80=9Cprobability,=
=E2=80=9D since he
is also a poet, of his viewpoint being as much of a =E2=80=9Cpoetic=E2=80=
=9D one as any
other poet=E2=80=99s. Whether one agrees or disagrees with his position=E2=
=80=94does it not
involve one with politics at least in order to deny one=E2=80=99s involveme=
nt in it?

I like very much Murat=E2=80=99s expression =E2=80=9Cthe independent,
accidental, chaotic power, of poetry;=E2=80=9D I think for myself the diffi=
culty
with it arises with in the context it is expressed in: that of assertions,
of quotations from =E2=80=9Cauthorities=E2=80=9D and so forth. That is, thi=
s manner of
contextualizing such =E2=80=9Cindependent, accidental, chaotic power, of po=
etry=E2=80=9D
basically denies the existence of al these elements by making of them an
=E2=80=9Ceither/or=E2=80=9D statement of assertion, a taking of sides again=
st inclusivity in
poetry, the denial of its power to behave out of the poet=E2=80=99s control=
, out of
even its own control . . .



By imposing criteria, as I indicated earlier, one is attempting to control
the direction and elements of the discussion. By imposing criteria, one is
limiting what a poet, what a poem what a poetry and poetics may be. This is
because, I think, it has to do with the idea that a poet, a poem, a poetry,
a poetics, is involved with a seeking for something, even if that something
has nothing to do with readers, listeners, writers at all, it is still a
search for poetry as something which exists in such a such condition, of
which one can be at a certain point and level, sure. One has faith, then ,
that it exists, it must exist=E2=80=94

For many years I have been working with and thinking on the Found, which is
something very often =E2=80=93I would say nearly always in many ways though=

work--) The more I have worked with l, lived with, though on this little
phrase, the more profound I find it the more profound I see the gulf betwee=
n
the Search, the Seeker and the one who finds.=C2=A0 The latter is operating=
 in
the area which Paul Celan writes of, in which =E2=80=9CPoetry no longer imp=

itself, but exposes itself.=E2=80=9D One does not know what one may find, w=
hether by
accident, by being independent of preconceived images, ideas and dogmas, or

poetry but of anything which one =E2=80=9Ccomes across,=E2=80=9D meets in o=

leaving one with the assertion of=E2=80=94what?=C2=A0 A conflict? A drama? =
A void . . .
abhorred by Nature--

For myself, the assertion that poetry has nothing to do with politics is a
very political one, in that it is limiting what the action, the elements of
a poem, of poetry, of poetics is, it is limiting the actions by poets and
groups of poets as wel as depriving them of vast areas of elements of
materials to use. For myself, this is a deeply political act, for in denyin=
g
the politics of its political act, the assertion is beginning to use that
form of sophism one encounters non stop in the media, which has been used t=
o
drag a country into one War after another while its poets=E2=80=99 rhetoric=
s are
turned towards a critique of critiquing the conditions of poetry in the sam=
e
manner that the polices of the State critique and essay to make irrelevant
and non-existent any critique of its policies, increasingly dependent on a
language of erasure and denial, so that one wil not notice that the proud
election of a Black President means not the =E2=80=9Cend to racism=E2=80=9D=
 in America any
more than it lessens the support for the world=E2=80=99s one Apartheid Stat=
e.=C2=A0 The
only way to juggle such contradictions as this nation=E2=80=99s policies em=
body
daily, is to also make the assertion that, along with poetry, one has
nothing to do with politics. To deny the contradictions is to say that
things that are opposites are the same. War=3DPeace. Love =3DHate, etc=C2=
=A0 What
does Poetry =3D then? Non-Politics, Non Poetry---???=C2=A0 Poetry=3DPoetry!=
!!!=C2=A0 Yet
who decides what Poetry is?



The greatest victory for the State is when no one and nothing has anything
to do with politics. =E2=80=9CLet them write poetry!!!=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94as =
=E2=80=9Cno one listens to it=E2=80=9D
and, perhaps, poetry does not listen to the poets either!

One might even find this situation developing:

*In a jerky and ferocious style, [Defoe's] essay argued that literature
should be written by non-literary people, just as politics should be and
indeed was being taken over by non-politicians, as (Defoe) was delighted to
observe. The corresponding revolution in writing, Defoe went on to say,
would, in a sense, abolish literature itself. When poetry is written by
non-poets and read by non-readers.*

Tougher than anything.

No one listens to poetry. The ocean

Does not mean to be listened to. A drop

Nothing.

Hi, I'm forwarding this message from an artist/friend in Tucson. It
would be great if some poet or couple or family would decide to spend
2 to 3 months in Tucson, maybe even working with me at Chax Press in
some way. July through September in Tucson can be hot, but the house
has A/C, and Tucson is fairly quiet in the summer, if you're working
to finish that book of poems or novel or critical book or whatever.
Also a good poetry community, good university library, you're an hour
away from Mexico, 5 hours away from the Grand Canyon, 2 hours away
from the lovely old mining town now artist hang-out of Bisbee. If
you're interested, let me know and I'll quickly forward your interest
to Bailey Doogan, owner of the house. But make sure you back-channel
me directly at chax@theriver.com, as I'm not currently seeing all of
the poetics list messages. My guess is you should act quickly, as this
won't be around for long. I have photos, but can't send them to the
poetics e-list.

=0AAbout PREDICTIONS:=0A=0AAs is painfully obvious for many a religious lea=
der and many a psychic, predicting the future is an indeterminate business.=
 The work collected in PREDICTIONS takes that indeterminancy as a starting =
point and celebrates it. A futurist points to how the question of the futur=
e, once a matter for dreamers and philosophers, has moved to the center of =
development and scientific agendas. Several artists, well aware that accele=
rating changes to the environment require that we learn quickly, suggest ho=
w art might help us to understand and to rethink the interface between old =
technologies and new technologies in this time of environmental crisis. A w=
riter and a scientist team up to tell an alternate story of evolution. And =
a poet writes, "Predictions acquire full meaning when they apply to the, un=
til then, unimaginable." Edited by Cara Benson, with contributors Paul Rask=
in, Bart Bridger Woodstrup, Julie Sadler, David Zuga, Jason Zuga, and Monic=
a de la Torre.=0A=0A=0ALink to the series:=0Ahttp://www.molesnotmolar.com/=

Call For Submissions



Call for Submissions for a proposed anthology of new short works =
commemorating the centenary of the lyricist=92s birth.

SAMMY CAHN (1913-1993), the Academy- and Emmy-Award-winning lyricist of =
many of the standards commonly referred to as the =93Great American =
Songbook,=94 as well as the writer who =93put more words into Frank =
Sinatra=92s mouth than any other,=94 was very vocal in his disagreement =
with the policy that writers are not able to copyright the titles of =
their compositions.

In honor of the upcoming centenary of his birth in 2013, and with a =
loving wink at his titular annoynace, Dr. Gilbert L. Gigliotti of =
Central Connecticut State University is soliciting new poems, flash =
fiction, flash non-fiction, and micro-plays, each with the same title as =
one of his song lyrics.  The new pieces need not refer to the =
songwriter=92s lyrics nor be similar in theme or style to the originals; =
the editor only seeks a variety of literary approaches toward =96 and =
treatments of =96 Cahn=92s titles. Among some of his most widely =
recognizable songs include Call Me Irresponsible, Come Fly With Me, Let =
It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!, and Until the Real Thing Comes Along =
=97 just to name a very few.

Please send your submission by 1 July 2010 to gigliotti@ccsu.edu or:

Dr. Gilbert L. Gigliotti
Department of English
Central Connecticut State University
1615 Stanley Street
New Britain, CT 06050

Gilbert L. Gigliotti is a Professor of English at Central Connecticut =
State University and the editor of a pair of anthologies published by =
Entasis Press of Washington, DC, Sinatra: But Buddy I=92m a Kind of Poem =
(2008) and Ava Gardner: Touches of Venus (2010).

  * *

*Dear Friends and fellow poets*

*I was struck by the responses to the welcome news of "Saudi Woman Poet
Blasts Clerics on TV," and some of the surprise re the immense role poetry
plays in the Muslim world.*

*I have written 2 essay/reviews on line (see below) re the non-reception as
it were by American non-readers/readers of the "non-literarily translated"
Guantanamo "non" Poets" which examine "non-welcoming" responses of American
poets and poetics to the Guantanamo "non-poetry."  Read in such a context,
the responses to the Saudi Woman Poet on American-style "American Idol" TV
reveal further ironies in the American receptions of poetry in the Muslim
world.*

*Below the essay/reviews are found very important articles, with videos and
in one case at least, poetry, and links, which concern the treatments and
reception of women and their actions--or the limited lack thereof, as in th=
e
Sciences--in areas of the world in which the Americans are directly
involved, especially in the case of Dr **Aafia Siddiqui, who with her three
children was kidnapped and for many years "disappeared."  It is now reveale=
d
that Dr Siddiqui was held for years and brutally tortured, sexually
assaulted and humiliated before her rendition to the US by US Agents in the
prison of Baghram Airbase, where President Obama just made a surprise
appearance a few days ago to yet again extoll "the Right War" being carried
out by drones, troops and corruption in Afghanistan and along and inside th=
e
Pakistani border.  As an American General put is earlier this week, the US
has killed an incredible number of Afghanis--almost all of them civilians.*

*I also admire the courage of the Saudi poet, not only because of "blasting
the clerics," but also in a very real sense indirectly blasting on
American-style "American Idol" TV the regime which is one hundred percent
backed and paid for by American tax payer and Big Oil dollars, just as the
US funds the Israeli State which will not allow Palestinian recipients of
American sholarships to study in the US.
*

The issues of poets and poetics when mixed with "good" and "bad" poets in
situations which are at heart bought and paid for with US tax payer
(including tax paying poets') dollars are far more complex and contradictor=
y
than "yay/good" or "nay/bad" responses allow for . . .

Just recently here Murat and I were discussing the Ed Foster poem title
"Poetry Has Nothing to Do with Politics;" I think perhaps such examples as
given here give pause to investigate further how much it may be that the
receptions of poetry may be affected by "politics."

*JFAC Horrified by New Abuse Revelations, Aafia Siddiqui Forced to Walk
Naked Over the Qur=92an

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 30th 2010
Contact: info@justiceforaafia.org
*
As hundreds of concerned citizens hold a Day of Remembrance in Pakistan to
commemorate the seventh anniversary of her disappearance, the Justice for
Aafia Coalition reveal for the first time, in the English language, specifi=
c
harrowing details of the abuse Aafia Siddiqui was forced to endure in the
years spent in secret detention.

During the course of an interview by Kamran Shahid on Pakistan=92s Front Li=
ne,
screened 26th March, Siddiqui=92s mother and sister described publicly for =
the
first time the various forms of torture she underwent at the hands of US
agents. This included being:

   - forcefully stripped by six men and then repeatedly sexually abused
   - beaten with rifle butts until she bled
   - bound to a bed, with her hands and feet tied whilst unspecified forms
   of torture were administered to the soles of her feet and head
   - injected with unknown substances
   - dragged by her hair
   - having her hairs pulled out one by one
   - forced to walk on the Qu=92ran which had been desecrated in her cell
   whilst naked

Maryam Hassan, founder of the *Justice for Aafia Coalition (JFAC)*,
commented:*

=93These most recent horrific revelations shine a light for the first time =
on
years of detention shrouded until now in darkness and mystery. Forced
nudity, violent sexual abuse, the desecration of the Qu=92ran, video-taped
torture sessions have become infamous hallmarks of US detention since the
start of the War on Terror, from Bagram to Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.

The Obama administration must immediately disclose any video evidence in it=
s
possession relating to Ms Siddiqui=92s detention and torture. The American
public has a right to know what is being carried out in its name as much as
the Pakistani public are deserving of knowing the horrendous abuse one of
their citizens has been subjected to. =93

Notes for editor:
*
1. The Justice for Aafia Coalition is an umbrella body for a number of
organizations, groups, and activists created in February 2010 to campaign
for the release and return of Aafia Siddiqui and for the opening of a full
investigation into the circumstances of her detention and the whereabouts o=
f
her children.

2. Aafia Siddiqui=92s lawyers maintain that she was abducted by the Pakista=
ni
and US agents along with her three children in 2003 and rendered to
Afghanistan where she was detained by American forces for over five years.
Siddiqui claims she was abused, raped and tortured throughout her detention=
.
She was convicted in February 2010 of allegedly firing on US soldiers while
in custody in what appears to have been a grave miscarriage of justice.
Whilst her son Ahmed was released in September 2008 from Afghan custody, tw=
o
of her children remain unaccounted for to date. For full details of Aafia
Siddiqui=92s case, please visit www.justiceforaafia.org

        Dear David,

When the women left their homes that May morning in 2006, *they never
imagined the horrific experience that awaited them.*

In San Salvador Atenco, they encountered masses of police cracking down on
protests by a local peasant organization. Two people were killed, including
a 14-year-old boy. Even bystanders faced beatings, house raids, and
indiscriminate detentions. Of the hundreds detained, at least 45 were women=
.

On the way to prison, in a state police vehicle, many of the women were
beaten, raped, and sexually assaulted by police officers who had arrested
them.

More than two dozen of the women recounted being sexually assaulted. But th=
e
prison's medical staff ignored their claims and merely stitched up their
most obvious head wounds, conducting no forensic exams.

*Almost four years later, these women still wait for justice. *
 [image: Mexico's highest ranks have dragged their feet on this police
brutality case for four years. It's time hold to them

In a particularly cruel twist, many of the women arrested at Atenco were
charged with crimes such as ''blocking public roads.'' They even served
prison time, with the last of the women released in 2008.

The Atenco abuse investigation is now in the hands of Mexico state
authorities. Amnesty International is calling on them to bring the officers
to justice and provide reparations to survivors and their families.

Please help Amnesty fight for the women of
Atenco.<http://www.kintera.org/TR.asp?a=3DjwKVJiM1IgJ0JtL&s=3DapIHIROyGdJNK=

*JFAC Horrified by New Abuse Revelations, Aafia Siddiqui Forced to Walk
Naked Over the Qur=92an

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 30th 2010
Contact: info@justiceforaafia.org
*
As hundreds of concerned citizens hold a Day of Remembrance in Pakistan to
commemorate the seventh anniversary of her disappearance, the Justice for
Aafia Coalition reveal for the first time, in the English language, specifi=
c
harrowing details of the abuse Aafia Siddiqui was forced to endure in the
years spent in secret detention.

During the course of an interview by Kamran Shahid on Pakistan=92s Front Li=
ne,
screened 26th March, Siddiqui=92s mother and sister described publicly for =
the
first time the various forms of torture she underwent at the hands of US
agents. This included being:

   - forcefully stripped by six men and then repeatedly sexually abused
   - beaten with rifle butts until she bled
   - bound to a bed, with her hands and feet tied whilst unspecified forms
   of torture were administered to the soles of her feet and head
   - injected with unknown substances
   - dragged by her hair
   - having her hairs pulled out one by one
   - forced to walk on the Qu=92ran which had been desecrated in her cell
   whilst naked

Maryam Hassan, founder of the *Justice for Aafia Coalition (JFAC)*,
commented:*

=93These most recent horrific revelations shine a light for the first time =
on
years of detention shrouded until now in darkness and mystery. Forced
nudity, violent sexual abuse, the desecration of the Qu=92ran, video-taped
torture sessions have become infamous hallmarks of US detention since the
start of the War on Terror, from Bagram to Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.

The Obama administration must immediately disclose any video evidence in it=
s
possession relating to Ms Siddiqui=92s detention and torture. The American
public has a right to know what is being carried out in its name as much as
the Pakistani public are deserving of knowing the horrendous abuse one of
their citizens has been subjected to. =93

        Dear David,

When the women left their homes that May morning in 2006, *they never
imagined the horrific experience that awaited them.*

In San Salvador Atenco, they encountered masses of police cracking down on
protests by a local peasant organization. Two people were killed, including
a 14-year-old boy. Even bystanders faced beatings, house raids, and
indiscriminate detentions. Of the hundreds detained, at least 45 were women=
.

On the way to prison, in a state police vehicle, many of the women were
beaten, raped, and sexually assaulted by police officers who had arrested
them.

More than two dozen of the women recounted being sexually assaulted. But th=
e
prison's medical staff ignored their claims and merely stitched up their
most obvious head wounds, conducting no forensic exams.

*Almost four years later, these women still wait for justice. *

In a particularly cruel twist, many of the women arrested at Atenco were
charged with crimes such as ''blocking public roads.'' They even served
prison time, with the last of the women released in 2008.

The Atenco abuse investigation is now in the hands of Mexico state
authorities. Amnesty International is calling on them to bring the officers
to justice and provide reparations to survivors and their families.

Dear Reader,

A number of reputable organizations are rallying support to get the U.S.
government on board the international campaign to extend full human rights
to women, and your continued support is much needed. Violence against women
and girls is pandemic throughout the world, crossing all boundaries of
political, social and religious differences. An international standard to
repel such violence is long overdue, and this appeal for passage of a
congressional standard from the venerable International Rescue
Committee<http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=3D1103221334089&s=3D41646&e=3D001JID=

Dear Friend,

In the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti, women and girls are vulnerable
to exploitation and abuse as they struggle to survive and protect their
families. Stand up for women in Haiti =96 and other women around the world =
who
face unspeakable violence. *Watch our video and sign the IRC petition askin=

We must ensure a safer, more secure future for women and girls. The
