NYC is rendered all brilliant, "sparkly, and sad" in this new series

bedtime pillows of the city, where expansive feelings like longing,
desire, & nostalgia are toppled daily by the equally radiant &
ridiculous debris of the present.

in this very lyrical & poetic interview, j/j hastain and Lark Fox
discuss ceremony, the verb "to winter," wildness & its relationship to
non gender conformance, about feeling freest on the edge of things & the
importance of rust. I admit that I thought these two were the same
person, given the affinity of their creative & life philosophies.

please go to angelhousepress.com & click on essays.

I welcome interviews, rants, manifestos, musings, poetic & artistic
statements for our loosely termed essay series. thanks to all who have
sent me work so far. i appreciate your support & interest.

Hi,

Later this month we'll be putting out our sixth Portable Boog Reader, =20=

our poetry anthology this year featuring work from New York City and =20
Philadelphia poets. The New York City section is a collaborative =20
effort of four editors=97Lee Ann Brown, Mariana Ruiz Firmat, Sara Jane =20=

Stoner, and me, David Kirschenbaum=97while Kimberly Ann Southwick and =20=

Michelle Taransky are selecting the work for the Philadelphia section. =20=

(Bios for the co-editors follow this note.) In all, 18 different poets =20=

will each get their own tabloid page.

To see what previous Portable Boog Readers have looked like, visit:

Advertising in The Portable Boog Reader issue of Boog City means you =20
will reach more than 5,250 readers, poetry lovers, and small press =20
aficionados electronically and throughout the East Village, other =20
targeted areas of lower Manhattan; Williamsburg and Greenpoint, =20
Brooklyn; as well as bonus distribution at Boog City's monthly events, =20=

and the annual New Year's Day poetry marathons at The Poetry Project =20
at St. Mark's Church and The Bowery Poetry Club. That's an increase of =20=

16.7% over our regular issues for no additional cost. And, since this =20=

issue is an anthology of poetry, that means it will be held onto much =20=

longer by our readers as they read through the poems, many holding =20
onto the issue for future readings.

Boog City continues to offer our special Small Press Ad Rates. That =20
means when you advertise with us you will save 50% off of our regular =20=

display ad rates, making the adjusted Small Press Ad Rates:

      * Full Page        $250
      * Half-Page       $130
      * Quarter-Page   $70
      * Eighth-Page     $40

Here is a link to our full rate card:

We look forward to working with you to bring your message to the local =20=

arts community to increase awareness and sales of your publications in =20=

the New York area.

as ever,
David

ffalo and accommodation and expenses during the time of their stay. In addi=
tion to the stipend, Fellows will receive library and parking privileges at=

nts at an advanced stage of dissertation research and more senior scholars =
are invited to apply.

nd graduate students whose research is centered on the writings of James Jo=

of the books, manuscripts or unique documents in the UB Libraries special c=
ollections, which include materials from the Poetry Collection, University =

tory of Medicine Collection.

Please note that applicants may apply for only one fellowship per academic =
year.

coming research support (grants, fellowships, leaves, etc.);
 *   Letter of support from department chair or dissertation director.



Fellows will be selected based on the relevance of UB's special collections=

Boog City presents

BoogWork
Our last Tuesdays series now features the new BoogWork
series alternating with the 10th season of the levy lives:
celebrating the renegade press series. BoogWork will feature
two poets reading, a musical act performing, and then one
of the poets will give the gathered a poetry workshop
(don't forget to bring a pen and paper).

This Thurs., Dec. 13, 6:00 p.m. sharp
$5 suggested

reading and workshop from
Shafer Hall

and music from
Alex Battles

Sidewalk Caf=E9
94 Ave. A
NYC

Boog City is excited to host longtime creative collaborators Alex and =20=

Shafer in our BoogWork series, when Alex Battles will perform his =20
original songs, some of which were inspired by Shafer's antics, and =20
Shafer will read some poems, many of which were inspired by Alex's =20
music. During the performance, they will collaborate with the audience =20=

on a brand-new song about bars, barflies, and bartenders. At the end =20
of the evening, all will be encouraged to join Alex and Shafer in =20
performing the original work.

**Alex Battles
Former early high school talk show host Alex Battles once left =20
audiences in stitches with his high-energy brand of comedy and =20
slapdash banter. He rocketed out of the spotlight in his twenties, and =20=

when the wreck was excavated, he found himself a bartender and country =20=

singer in New York City. His critically acclaimed full-length record =20
Goodbye Almira was released in early 2012. He is the annual host and =20
producer of the long-running Brooklyn Country Music Festival and the =20
creative force behind the CasHank Hootenanny and Jamboree, which =20
Shafer Hall has called "the greatest party of his life."

**Shafer Hall
http://shaferhall.blogspot.com/
Washed up middle school football star Shafer Hall struck fear in the =20
hearts of a number of Spring Branch ISD quarterbacks when he played =20
defensive tackle for the Memorial Junior High Eagles. An ignominious =20
downfall fraught with whiskey, pills, and tacos finds him occasionally =20=

writing poetry while he proprietizes Mongoose Versus Cobra, a bar in =20
Houston, Texas.  Never Cry Woof, his full-length collection of poems, =20=

was published in 2005. He is a senior editor of Painted Bride =20
Quarterly and Lungfull! Magazine's Minister of Propaganda. He is Alex =20=

Battles' favorite living poet.

 Dear Friends,

There's no better day than today, Emily Dickinson's birthday, to share with you some highlights from your many wonderful responses to my last email asking which poems are important to you this season.

Ron from Oakland, CA wrote "Thanks to the Academy I've spread a greater love of poetry through my UU congregation.  I always include a bit of bio taken from your background info on the poets.  This month our theme is 'gratitude.' I posted to our website the poem, 'Thanks' by W.S. Merwin and found out several people had used the poem to start their meetings."

Gwenda from Belleview, FL noted that "Sara Teasdale's 'Barter' is one I share with my students.  I especially like the idea that 'Life has loveliness to sell'"

And Sara from North Beach, MD, remarked, "A poem that reminds me of this season is 'Falling: The Code' by Li-Young Lee.  When I was growing up in Michigan, my parents and grandparents had apple trees in their backyards, and the thud of apples hitting the ground and the smell of fruit starting to decay in the fallen leaves was a regular part of autumn."

Indeed, there is nothing like a "Page/ Of prancing Poetry." Poems help mark our celebrations and joyful life events. We rely on poetry to provide the right words at the right time. And in the stillness of this season, poems can also provide solace. As the winter holidays approach, for those of us who have lost loved ones, the falling snow can seem like, as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote, a "poem of the air" where the "troubled sky reveals the grief it feels." We need the empathetic expression that poetry provides.

The Academy of American Poets works hard to make thousands of poems available to you year round on Poets.org, to deliver them right to your in-box every morning though our Poem-A-Day program, and to inspire many millions of people during National Poetry Month in April to read and write poems. But, as a nonprofit organization, we can only continue our work to promote poetry, distribute poems, and make educational resources available on our website with your help.

Over the next few weeks, we need to raise $10,000, the first half of which will enable us to meet a match offered by the Bloomberg Foundation. Last year many of you helped us reach this goal, and we hope you will do so again by supporting our programs with a special year-end contribution. If you're able to give $50 or more, as a token of our gratitude, we will send you a copy of our Poem in Your Pocket anthology.

I thank you in advance for whatever you might be able to contribute, and for helping to champion poetry.

Gratefully,




Jennifer Benka

of fracture
rewriting Factura by Bruce Andrews

by Robin F. Brox & mIEKAL aND

FrEe DoWnLoAd =97
http://xexoxial.org/is/of_fracture/by/robin_f_brox_and_mIEKAL_and

Inspired by the December 2012 Fordham University symposium honoring
Bruce Andrews, Robin F. Brox and mIEKAL aND have created Of Fracture,
a homophonic translation of Andrews's Factura. Published in 1987 by
Xexoxial Editions, Factura is a book largely composed of morphemes,
phonemes, syllables and neologisms which prompted a rendering that
relies on Englishizing the text. The results are textured, staccato
pages that proceed, quite literally, as the original text dictated to
the ears of each poet-translator.

With any homophonic realization, there is a constant tension between
the automatic associations which instantly fill one's head and the
deeper body of poetic language lurking in the spaces between words.
The results are here, the shifting, unstable tectonics of sound and
sense in Of Fracture.

"of fracture is a resounding blast from the past, when syllables
roamed free on the page and ears had bounty crops. only now it's even
better, with all the echos."

=97Charles Bernstein

Robin F. Brox lives in Buffalo, New York. Her work has appeared in
Dusie #13, Lungfull! #17, The Buffalo News, and elsewhere. Her first
book, Sure Thing, was published by BlazeVOX [books] in 2011. Her next
book, POMEGRANATES, is forthcoming from Xexoxial Editions. Her
one-woman feminist press, Saucebox, produces handmade chapbooks and
broadsides.

mIEKAL aND is the author of numerous books, many available via
Xexoxial Editions. After many years working in the realms of digital
poetry and video, he has surrendered his role as author and focuses
exclusively on interactions that allow the author to be reconfigured
by the mysteries of the collaborative process, including books with
Maria Damon, Sheila Murphy, Geof Huth & now Robin F. Brox.

Published by Xerox Sutra Editions December 2012.  Hard Copies
available after Christmas! As always, review copies upon request.

       Indian Song

The stone is hard
The stamen & pistil of this flower
yet wild yet near

The city street is dark

This hand, these lips
The stone is hard
the city street dark

The wild woodlands break out
open upon the subterranean plains
yet wild yet near
The city is dark

         JOSEPH CERAVOLO


       Untitled

All winter the
       leaves
stay on this ground

the sun

The rake, the hoe
the furrows

the moon

All winter
embodies

The ashes

Working insects beneath

         JOSEPH CERAVOLO


       Hidden Bird

Song birds enter the morning
the pre-dawn before the fires,
you know, when the night floats away
like vapor on a lake,
or like kisses in the woods.
Songs that even creation
might not remember.

Continuous, threaded, as if
a cherry pit were stuck
in the throat
to produce the trumpet of the branches.
So varies, yet never, changing
through all the days, since
reptiles fell to earth.

I give up the reason for the sound
I give up the creature of sound
and the creator of the creatures
and of us and of dawn and
air and of vacuum
and human inhumanity.
I give up the song.
I give up the place

         JOSEPH CERAVOLO

Hi all - Drunken Boat's Kickstarter for Lisa Russ Spaar's "The Hide-and-See=
k Muse: Annotations of Contemporary Poetry" is now halfway towards meeting =
its goal. Would you help us get over the top by making a tax-deductible don=
ation?=20

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1721544611/the-hide-and-seek-muse-annot=
ations-on-contemporary

And the book is available for pre-order here: =20

09/ref=3Dsr_1_3?s=3Dbooks&ie=3DUTF8&qid=3D1355065433&sr=3D1-3=20

For people who are a bit wary of poetry, this is the perfect antidote: the =
poems are amazing, and so are Lisa Russ Spaar=92s short essays in the "Hide=
-and-Seek Muse".  There=92s a sense of clarity about everything here (not t=
hat things aren=92t complex; not that Lisa=92s analyses aren=92t fascinatin=
g constructs themselves, insightful and inspiring, though not intimidating.=
)  I=92d think anyone who cares about an inner reality that might be someho=
w communicated =96 nailed; set free; amplified; questioned -- would embrace=
 the chance to read poems that elucidate so muchabout the mind and the hear=
t, and to understand better the urges embodied in the process of constructi=
ng a poem, which always speaks from its structure of restraint.  I loved ev=
ery minute of reading this book.
                                                                      =20

My entry for poet Sonnet L'Abbe' in The Canadian Enclopedia:

http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/sonnet-labbe

"Sonnet L'Abbe's poetic themes of ethnicity and environmentalism display
the influence of her father, a Franco-Ontarian potter, and mother, a
Guyanese artist. In addition, L'Abbe's travels in South Korea, Uzbekistan,
and the Philippines inspired poetry about the relationship between culture,
history, and the natural world. . . ."

Cheers!

Dear friends,



Having supported modern and contemporary poets and poetry since 1935, the P=

Last fall, we launched a new fundraising campaign to establish a Friends of=
 the Poetry Collection Society and begin building an endowed Friends of the=
 Poetry Collection Future Fund. The purpose of this fund is to create an ad=
ditional stream of income to purchase new materials while also supporting s=
pecial projects such as member events and publications.


We hope that you will please join this year's group of friends by making a =
donation to the Friends of the Poetry Collection Future Fund. As always, yo=
ur gift is tax deductible and will help support the research and teaching m=
issions of the Poetry Collection. Each year the collection supports with it=
s materials a wide range of scholarly publications, opens its doors to visi=
ting researchers from around the world, and assists the educational activit=
ies of undergraduate and graduate students. Furthermore, the collection hos=
ts numerous lectures, conferences, readings, and other events, making it an=
 active research center for the study of modern and contemporary poetry.

Your support will help us continue serving as the library of record for twe=
ntieth- and twenty-first-century poetry in English. To make a donation, ple=
ase visit library.buffalo.edu/pl/giving.

The Poetry Collection also appreciates gifts of new and used poetry publica=

There are writers whose work is read; there are those whose work is browsed=
 through at a bookstore, then placed back on a shelf; then, there is Gaspar=
=E2=80=99s work. Books with folded down pages. Passages underlined and high=
lighted. Gaspar is a writer whose work is shared with friends and complete =
strangers. His books are announced and posted through links on Twitter and =
Facebook. He is a writer for whom fans travel great distances to hear and f=
or whom devotees stand in long lines at book fairs just for an autograph; a=
 writer whose books readers buy for themselves, not once but twice, since t=
he binding of the original has been read so many times it has fallen apart.=
 A much-beloved writer, whose books are bought for your father and mother, =
your best friend. Books to save your own life.

Advance Announcement:

Native Women Language Keepers: Indigenous Performance Practices. An
Arts-Based Research Symposium with playwright Alanis King.

January 29th to February 1st 2013, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Aanii! Join us for UM=92s sixth arts-based research symposium, a
week-long exploration of Native women=92s practices as language
teachers, activists, and artists. In this week, we=92re workshopping a
play by celebrated Native playwright Alanis King, and we will work in
close connection with Miiskwaasinii=92ing Nagamojig (The Swamp Singers),
a Michigan-based hand-drum group, who will work with King to create a
praise song for Daphne Odjig=92s woodland paintings in the University of
Michigan=92s archives.
This symposium will marry the strengths of the University of
Michigan=92s Anishinaabemowin language program, a thriving community of
language teachers and learners, with our series of arts-based research
symposia, in which we investigate ways of knowing through creative
means.
In this week, we want to ask questions about the place of performance
and women=92s work in language survivance and revitalization, about
decolonizing methodologies and performance, about honoring Native
women artists, and about intercultural performance practices.
The core guest for the week-long symposium in January 2013 is Alanis
King, an Odawa Playwright/Director originally from the Wikwemikong
Unceded Indian Reserve, the first Aboriginal woman to graduate from
the National Theatre School of Canada.

Every day this week, in the mornings and on Wednesday afternoon,
Alanis King is going to workshop her play with symposium fellows and
language classes in the Duderstadt Video Performance studio. If
interested in participating in this Tuesday-Friday work in
Anishinaabe/English, please contact the symposium directors for times.

Open Programs:

Tuesday

Afternoon, 3-5, Central Campus, North Quad, Room 3245, Emilie Monnet

Emilie Monnet is an interdisciplinary artist with Anishnabe and French
heritage and a graduate of Ondinnok=92s First Nations Theatre training
program =96 in partnership with The National Theatre School of Canada
(Montreal, 2007). Emilie co-directed and performed Bird Messengers,
for which she was awarded the LOGIQ prize for the most outstanding
Art/Culture project of 2011. In May 2012, Emilie directed Songs of
Mourning, Songs of Life, a musical theatrical show addressing legacies
of genocide and the role of art for collective mourning, in
collaboration with the Aboriginal women=92s drum group Odaya and the
Rwandan traditional musical ensemble, Komezinganzo.
She has two works into development: OKINUM, a one-women
interdisciplinary performance inspired by her great great
grand-mother, and another theatre collaboration with indigenous
artists from the Amazon, Colombia. Emilie=92s artistic engagement is
inspired by years of social activism with indigenous organizations in
Canada and Latin America, and community art projects with incarcerated
women and Aboriginal youth. Emilie is the founder and Artistic
Director of ONISHKA, an arts organization that fosters artistic
collaborations between indigenous peoples worldwide while honoring
their richness, diversity and resilience (www.onishka.org).
She is giving a presentation on ONISHKA=92s work.

Evening, Central Campus North Quad, Room 2435:
7pm, Formal Symposium Opening with Heid Erdrich

Poet Heid E. Erdrich, a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Ojibwe,
was born in Breckenridge, Minnesota, and raised in nearby Wahpeton,
North Dakota, where her Ojibwe mother and German American father
taught at the Bureau of Indian Affairs boarding school.
 Erdrich=92s poetry often explores themes of indigenous culture,
mothering, and the natural world, using the cadence of oral
storytelling and a close attention to sound and meter to drive poems
rich with sensory and dreamlike imagery. Erdrich is the author of
several poetry collections, including Cell Traffic (2012), National
Monuments (2008), winner of the Minnesota Book Award; The Mother=92s
Tongue (2005), part of Salt Publishing=92s award-winning Earthworks
Series of Native American and Latin American literature; and Fishing
for Myth (1997). In a 2006 review, Twin Cities Daily Planet critic
Erin Lynn Marsh described The Mother=92s Tongue as =93an exploration of
our culture=92s relationship with the term =91mother=92 and of the
beginnings of language.=94
With her sister, the writer Louise Erdrich, she founded the Turtle
Mountain Writing Workshop. In 2008 the sisters co-founded Birchbark
House, a foundation that serves as a clearinghouse for literature
engaged with indigenous languages. The sisters describe their vision
on the foundation=92s website: =93We foresee a vital return to our Native
American languages through the efforts of elders that are already
underway. In creating ways to keep their words alive, through books,
films, teaching and more, we will keep our languages viable and more,
we will allow the means for creative fluency, the hallmark of a fully
living language.=94

Wednesday:

11.45-13.00, Duderstadt Video Performance Studio: Angel Sobotta

Angel Sobotta (Nez Perce), is a Nez Perce language teacher in the
tribal headstart, local schools, and at the Lewis Clark State College
in Idaho. She is also a writer and documentary filmmaker of projects
like, "=92Ipsqilaanx heewtnin' weestesne =96 Walking on Sacred Ground =96
the Nez Perce Lolo Trail" and "Surviving Lewis and Clark: The
Niimiipuu Story" both winning the Aurora and Telly awards
respectively. She is also a theater maker with the Lapwai Afterschool
Programs, teaching language by adapting legends and directing the
youth, including "Niimiipuum Titwaatit =96 The People=92s Stories," an
anti-bullying project (2012). Angel is a University of Idaho
Interdisciplinary Masters student. Her thesis involves an immersion
experience for language teachers by adapting the Nez Perce creation
story, written in the Nez Perce language, into a stage play.
She is giving a presentation on her work.

Evening, 7pm, Central Campus: Marcie Rendon

Marcie Rendon (Anishinaabe) is a theatre maker and writer activist who
supports and encourages other writers to write in Ojibwe. Among her
projects are a writing residency she facilitated on the White Earth
reservation as part of a three-phase Project Hoop Residency to create
theater projects at a community level.
She will lead this workshop:
I have a ten-minute play, Friends...; which was published in
Performing Worlds into Being: Native American Women=92s Theater, edited
by Ann Elizabeth Armstrong, Kelli Lyon Johnson, and William A.
Wortman; Miami University Press, Oxford, Ohio, 2009, which I would
like to work to have translated into Ojibwe for possible production in
Winnipeg in 2013.  My Ojibwe language abilities are limited so having
a group of language experts assist would be one of my goals for our
time together.  We will have a reading of the script and then work
together on translation issues.

Thursday:

Afternoon, 3-5, Central Campus: Virginie Magnat

Virginie Magnat is Assistant Professor of Performance at University of
British Columbia, Okanagan. She conducts embodied research on
transmission processes among women performers from different cultures,
traditions, and generations; and draws from Indigenous epistemologies
and methodologies to examine the interrelation of lived experience,
embodied knowledge, tradition, creativity, and spirituality. Her essay
"Can Research Become Ceremony? Performance Ethnography and Indigenous
Epistemologies" appeared in summer 2012 in the Canadian Theatre
Review.
She will share a workshop called "Sharing Embodied Cultural Knowledge
Through Traditional Songs." This session will be practice-based:
participants will be invited to share/teach/learn traditional songs
from their cultural legacy so that we can get to know each other
through our songs.

Thursday, 7pm, Lloyd Hall Common Room
Create a new praise song with the Swamp Women, Miiskwaasinii=92ing
Nagamojig, in Lloyd Hall, among Daphne Odjig=92s=92s paintings. Come,
sing, drum and be part of the community!

Friday:
On Friday morning, we=92ll gather for a workshop sharing and process
discussion in the Duderstadt Video Performance Studio. 10-1.

In the afternoon, we end our gathering by reflecting on aesthetics,
women and performance. 2.30-4.30, Central Campus.

Margaret Noori (Anishinaabe) received an MFA in Creative Writing and a
PhD in English and Linguistics from the University of Minnesota.  She
is Director of the Comprehensive Studies Program and teaches the
Anishinaabe Language and American Indian Literature at the University
of Michigan.  She is also one of the founders of the drum group
Miskwaasining Nagamojig, current President of Association for the
Study of American Indian Literatures, one of the Clan Mothers who
coordinate the annual Native American Literature Symposium, and member
of the Anishinaabemowin-Teg Executive Board.  Her book Bwaajimowin: A
Dialect of Dreams in Anishinaabe Language and Literature is
forthcoming from MSU Press and her poetry has recently appeared in the
Michigan Quarterly Review, Sing: Poetry from the Indigenous Americas
and Cell Traffic by Heid Erdrich.  For more information visit
www.ojibwe.net where she and her colleagues have created a space for
language that is shared by academics and the native community.
She will be work-shopping a chapter from a forthcoming book on
Anishinaabe narrative traditions which traces the way "oral"
traditions are actually "physical" performance traditions which carry
thought into space and allow us to exchange our interpretations of the
world around as word which becomes stage dialogue, story, lyrics or
poetry.

We are happy to welcome non-UM graduate students and faculty to this
free week-long program: if you want to join us, please contact us.

MOODBOARD
7-9pm Thursday, December 13th

Featuring:
Chris Cuellar
Kristi McGuire
Anthony Romero
Tracy Jeanne Rosenthal

at the Chicago Cultural Center
5th Floor, Millennium Park Room
presented by the Poetry Center of Chicago

This event may consist of 30 or more strangely ordered questions.  This event may contain sprawling, poorly organized, deeply principled remarks lasting nearly 48 minutes.  This event does not accept requests.  This event would not use the word "intense" to describe itself, nor would it use the word "casual."  This event will feature readings and performances by 4 non-conspirators from LA or Chicago & will be presented in a setting at once both strange and ceremonious.  This event is madly in love with you, and by you, it means ringtones, go to ringtones dot com and click on the picture of the screaming Koala to find out more.  This event hates talking about itself, unless it's talking about itself in the third-person.  This event takes vulnerability very seriously. This event never had a penny to its name, so it's changing its name.  This event really likes the phrase, "I will be your outsider if that's how you need me."

Chris Cuellar (artist, LA) likes to work with writing, sound, performance & digital media. He has earned an MFA in Writing from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2010. An ongoing durational performance called 'Minutes Project' will be currently on display through January at ACRE Projects in Chicago. He has made work for the Austin New Music Co-op in Austin, TX; various galleries in Chicago, including the Hyde Park Arts Center; and Diapason Gallery in Brooklyn. You can visit his website (yoursmountain.com), find him on the Instagram (@firstperson), follow him on the Twitter (@yoursmt) and/or Key Party with him on the Facebook.

Anthony Romero is a performer and writer based in Chicago. His works have been performed nationally, most notably at Links Hall and The Hyde Park Art Center in Chicago. His poetry and criticism have been published by Ugly Duckling Press, Poetry Quarterly, ArtWrit Magazine, and The Huffington Post, among others. He is currently a performer in residence at The Chicago Cultural Center through the generous support of DanceBridge.

Kristi McGuire is an artist, writer, and editor. She analyzes and theorizes the interstitial spaces between and around neoliberalism, bureaucracy, the historicization of 20th-c avant-garde movements, defunct psychoanalytic metaphors,working-class American antagonism, "cultural criticism," experimental feminist poetics,"the artist's publication," hybrid practitioners, deceased choreographers, Gordon Matta-Clark, "the archive" and "the internet." She holds an MA from the University of Chicago and an MA/MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She teaches at SAIC, is coeditor of Theorizing Visual Studies: Writing across the Discipline (Routledge 2012), and will be a 2013 artist-in-residence at Headlands Center for the Arts.

Tracy Jeanne Rosenthal is a pop culture rubbernecker and NYC traitor to LA. She was a Lambda Literary Fellow, an &Now Festival panelist, and has a BA from Vassar and an MFA from CalArts. Find her writing in GOOD, [PANK], Wanted, and Work magazines, The Collagist, Sang Blue, Floating Bridge Review, or the Writers Among Artists anthology Faggot Dinosaur. Her first chapbook, Close, is forthcoming with Sibling Rivalry Press. There r pix @ tracyjeannerosenthal.com.

Pavement Saw Chapbook Contest: Deadline 12/31
reduced cost this year, $15 mail (US) or $18 electronic, worldwide

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Submit electronically, save the hassle of printing out a manuscript and have your funds support poetry not the post office! Directly enter by using our website http://www.pavementsaw.org/pages/chapcontest.htm

$500 and 50 copies of the winning chapbook will be awarded to the winner. In addition to the prize winner, at least one other manuscript will be published under a standard royalty contract (author paid 10% of press run). Everyone is allowed to submit regardless of previous publication history. Every entrant will receive the equivalent cost of the entry fee in Pavement Saw Press titles.

Unlike many publishers whose collections are printed one copy at a time and therefore lack a large circulation, our chapbooks are published in a first edition of 400 copies plus overage. While chapbooks rarely receive exposure, ours have been reviewed in Poets and Writers, Publishers Weekly, The Georgia Review, Small Press Review and many others. Our previous winners have had subsequent full length books appear from a bevy of publishers including Ahsahta Press, Curbstone Press, Cleveland State University Press, Birds llc, Bear Star Press, Shearsman Books, Futurepoem Books, University of Georgia, Tupelo Press, Hanging Loose Press and so on.

Submit up to 32 pages of poetry. Include a signed cover letter with your name, address, phone number, e-mail, publication credits, a brief biography and the title of the chapbook. Include a cover page with your contact information and the chapbook title. Include a second page with the chapbook title only. Do not include your name on any pages inside the manuscript except for the first title page. No need for a contents page. All chapbooks are selected blindly / anonymously. Manuscripts will be considered until December 31st, 2012. Entry fee: $15 for US entries, $18 overseas, $18 electronic (world wide).

If you wish to submit electronically, send $18.00 via paypal to info@pavementsaw.org. Then e-mail the manuscript as an attachment to the same address and we will send you an e-mail confirmation that your entry is all set. Electronic submissions need to be sent as PDF files or as word (.doc or .docx) files. Other formats are not accepted. The extra cost is to cover the paypal fees as well as the time, labor, ink, and so on, to print out your manuscript. Or use our website http://www.pavementsaw.org/pages/chapcontest.htm

If you wish to send via regular mail, have your envelope postmarked by December 31st and accompany your manuscript with a check in the amount of $15.00 payable to Pavement Saw Press. All contributors to the contest will receive books, chapbooks and journals equal to, or more than, the entry fee. Add $3 (US) for other countries to cover the extra postal charge. Do not include an SASE for notification of results. Do not send the only copy of your work. All manuscripts are recycled and individual comments on the manuscripts cannot be made. This year the editor will be the judge and, as it should be, he promises not to chose former students, former or potential sexual partners, press interns, or people that can make him famous. A decision will be reached in March. Entries should be sent to our address at the bottom of the page.

	A Note on the Text

	I have used you
	where other words are not
	where I am
	alone a little
	walk a little strong wind
	clear eyes full of stars
	coming off the crystal the lake
	seems to be tonight.
	I will write later to light
	matches. As much as we are that
	we are sentinel listening
	over the five or six miles
	of threshold between
	one town and the next.
	This town I found
	the cause of it
	the river. I have used one thing
	where I have had many and the winter
	has been difficult and the winter
	has not even started yet.
	Burn purpose or burn
	some big habit you cant
	go back to beforehand.
	It will be hard to read
	the reminders you set
	in the dark preceding
	the light in the morning.
	By you I mean so it is not
	strange but since and promised
	and whole in sickness and in
	any condition resisted
	the big mind shining I know also that.

Good morning!



j/j=92s book=92s been getting lots of attention here and I=92m extending th=
e
invitation for the pre-release sale until the end of the year, and everyone
who orders a copy will receive, as a gift, a hand-made chapbook from our
awesome catalogue. (If you already own one or more of our chapbooks, or if
you=92d like something specific, please get in touch with me after you=92ve
ordered so you can choose something personally). j/j also suggested
something a little crazy: everyone who orders a copy of the book will get a
few strands of hair from j/j=92s scalp, strands which appear in digitized
format on the covers of the book. See it here:
http://furniturepressbooks.com/books/hastainmyrrh/



We=92ve also got a big subscriptions call going out at
http://furniturepressbooks.com/subscriptions/, and we=92re choosing a handf=
ul
of people who contribute $100 or more to be entered into a drawing to
receive a lifetime subscription to Furniture Press Books.



We=92re pushing really hard this year because our big 14 city tour has got =
to
be worth ten years of publishing. We encourage you to support small presses
like us=97we=92re the driving force behind promoting and realizing what I t=
hink
is the best poetry and poetics happening around the country. Don=92t let th=
e
big corporate publishers tell you otherwise!



From everyone in the Furniture Press Books family, we wish you a terrific
new year and happy reading.



Cheers!

it written 2011 to 12, and Even You might buy one today at any one of the
three fairly world-shattering prices that will imminently follow the colon

Greetings, those who call it Sentience and those who don't! There's some
very cool new work up at www.UnlikelyStories.org , namely:

Four Paintings by Allison Schulnik
"rhetorical atolls emerging:" An Interconnected Set of Movies and
Digital Weirdnesses by Jason Nelson
"Choice and Its Opposite: On Listening to Other People's Music," in
which David Brennan gives up control of his music selection for a year.

There's more cool art you should be checking out right now, but first, I
want to talk about Joseph Rose, our outgoing Political Editor. For
almost a year now, Joseph has been sorting, analyzing, and collecting
some fantastic work for /Unlikely Stories: Episode IV/: satires, essays
of various sorts, firsthand accounts of political activism, and an
amazing selection of short political films. Unfortunately, Joseph's life
as a student and parent has become more intensive, and he can no longer
execute his /Unlikely/ duties fully, so is stepping down. We'll miss him
and his great work.

As for me, I recently spent a few hectic days in New York, during which
I read with the fantastic Yuko Otomo and Steve Dalachinsky (and do you
know Steve's Unlikely Book at
http://unlikelystories.org/unlikely_books/trust_fund_babies_phenomena_of_interference.shtml
?) at Saturn Series Poetry, which has been operating under the direction
of Su Polo for /nineteen years/ (see
http://www.supolo.com/Saturn_Series_Poetry.html ). Su and I also had the
great privilege of standing in for the late Carol Novack and the
living-in-Japan Tom Bradley, reading from their call-and-reponse novel,
/Felicia's Nose/. We celebrated the release of /Felicia's Nose/ (and the
late Hugh Fox's poetry book, /Primate Fox/) --published by the
newly-organized MadHat Press-- at The Carol Novack
Christmas-Hannukah-Kwanzaa-Solstice-and-Atheists-Who-Love-to-Party
Tribute Party at A Gathering of the Tribes.//Mitch Corber shot video. I
hope I look pretty!

/Felicia's Nose/ and /Primate Fox/ are both now available for purchase
as print editions or as $4 e-books, so get over to
http://madhat-press.com/ and get some of that! But first check out our
mid-month update at http://www.unlikelystories.org/ , for it is smaller
than usual, and extra-awesome*.

Does that answer your questions, Doctor,

*Carol /hated/ the colloquialization of the word awesome. We miss her,
and resolve to use it constantly this year.

Dear all - wanted to let you know about this, if you are interested or coul=
d share with your students. It's probably the most vital MFA program I've e=
ver been in contact with, comprised of students from mainland China, India,=
 Singapore, Japan, Australia, the UK and the US. This summer Rae Armantrout=
 will be visiting the residency. Happy holidays - RS=20

The City University Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in Creative Writing
programme is the first low-residency MFA to be established in Asia,
and the only one in the world to focus on Asia. Its mission is to
provide the best education possible for aspiring creative writers and
teachers of creative writing, and to foster an interest in Asian
writing in English as well as literature in English concerned with
Asian themes. Launched in 2010, this two-year MFA degree is designed
to improve and develop practising writers, and is taught by
established and well-published authors who have both Asian and
international backgrounds and expertise. The MFA is a professional
qualification that prepares graduates to work in a range of fields
where good writing is required, including cultural and arts
administration, the creative industries, editing, and publishing. It
is also a widely-acknowledged qualification for teaching creative

hi -- I just replaced the uploaded video with a higher resolution
version, which makes a difference in some formats. Please substitute
this URL for the previous one, which may have stopped working (sorry for
the bother):

This is a short reading by Robert Kelly of /Uncertainties /(Station Hill
of Barrytown) and conversation thereon between the poet and Mariel
Norris and George Quasha.

The video is independently edited by Mariel Norris from approximately an hour of video with no substantive input from me.

TERRACE FENCE by BILL BERKSON
While living in Bolinas, poet and critic Bill Berkson produced Terrace Fence, a
seminal piece of conceptual photography doubling as a small-town protest gesture
in an edition of ten or fewer. Reproduced in the summer of 2012 in an edition of
100, the text was printed letterpress on pure cotton paper and the photographs
were reproduced from the original paste-up and tipped in by hand. Each copy has
been signed by the author. $20

SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHY: A FIRESIDE BOOK OF GURUS by ZEPHYRUS IMAGE
Spirit Photography: A Fireside Book of Gurus (1973) by Michael Myers and
Holbrook Teter is arguably the greatest book produced by Zephyrus Image. Spirit
Photography is essential reading for anyone interested in photography,
conceptual art, artistsâ€™ books, and the unique cultural climate of the Bay Area
in the '70s. This facsimile was printed letterpress and is faithful to the
original in every way, right down to the errata slip. $12

3 by TED GREENWALD (BACK IN PRINT!)
Published in 2008, Ted Greenwald's classic, 3, quickly went out of print.
Cuneiform press is pleased to announce a second printing (paperback only). Poet
Ron Padgett writes: "Ted Greenwald's 3 takes the mind in at least three
different directions simultaneously, in hardboiled, richly detailed, well-made
poems whose giddy wordplay, pantoum-like interweavings, and nimble jumpcuts
create a sort of 21st-century Poet in New York. An inspired challenge and a
delight." Cover by Richard Kegler. Paperback. $16.95

MIMEO MIMEO #7: THE LEWIS WARSH ISSUE
Mimeo Mimeo #7 is the first magazine ever devoted in its entirety to poet,
novelist, publisher, teacher, and collage artist Lewis Warsh. Warsh was born in
1944 in the Bronx, co-founded Angel Hair Magazine and Books with Anne Waldman in
1966, and went on to co-found United Artists Magazine and Books with Bernadette
Mayer in 1977. He is the author of over 30 books of poetry, fiction and
autobiography, the Director of the MFA program in Creative Writing at Long
Island University in Brooklyn, and as youâ€™ll soon discover, so much more.
Includes an introduction by Daniel Kane, an interview conducted by Steve Clay,
10 new stories, 5 new poems, dozens of photographs and collages, and an
anecdotal bibliography. $20

COMPLETE FRAGMENTS by LARRY FAGIN
Complete Fragments is Larry Faginâ€™s first trade edition book of poems since Iâ€™ll
Be Seeing You (1978). Cloth and paperback available. Fagin is the author of 14
books of poetry. He is the co-publisher of Adventures in Poetry books, and edits
Sal Mimeo, a little magazine. He lives in New York City, where he teaches
privately. $16

Please pray for Jane Cortez.

Mel Edwards has alerted us within the last hour that Jane is seriously
ill and is in intensive care on account what is believed to be a viral
infection which has damaged her heart.She has been undergoing tests over
the last six weeks but her condition has worsened.

Mel was concerned that as many of Jane=92s friends and comrade activists
as possible such know this, particularly the International Radical Black
Book Fair family.We will keep you updated as we receive further
information from Mel.

In Peace and with Hope!

I'm currently researching Harry Crosby and poets influenced by him. I've
seen oblique claims that Phillip Lamantia made some statements regarding
Crosby in the third release of Black Swan Press's magazine /Arsenal/,
but I've not found any extant copies in collections via WorldCat. If
anybody here has a lead on where a copy might be found to be perused
(and preferably scanned), I'd greatly appreciate the assistance.

Dear Friends of Big Bridge,

Please find below an extremely important petition, "LIFE IN PRISON FOR A
POEM",  that Terri and I and Pina Piccolo (100 Thousand Poets for
Change-Bologna, Italy) have been working on with friends.

As poets and artists we have a personal stake in seeing this poet released
from prison. His persecution is the persecution of all poets and we feel
this is something we can't stand by and watch without taking immediate
action.

We are very excited by the broad community support we have received thus
far and it would be a great honor to have you join us in support of this
action by signing the petition and forwarding it to like-minded friends.

Thank you for all you do!

Peace and love,

Michael Rothenberg and Terri Carrion

*Qatari poet Mohamed Ibn Al Ajami=92s crime consisted of reciting a poem
extolling the courage and values of the popular uprisings in Tunisia.* For
that he's been sentenced to life in prison.

*Please join with a remarkable list of prominent poets from around the
world and urge the court in Qatar to
reconsider.*<http://act.rootsaction.org/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=3D7=
041>

Rather than making itself an instrument for cracking down on dissent, we
believe that the Court should uphold Mohamed Ibn Al Ajami=92s right to free
speech. The poem he recited called for an end to intolerable conditions, a
demand that for the past two years has been aired by millions throughout
North Africa and the Arab world.
*
In this spirit, we poets and non-poets who perceive the need for worldwide
change at the social, political and ecological level, call on the Court to
review the appeal, stop siding with repression and lend its ear to the
movements that have sprung up all over the world for dignity, social
justice and freedom, virtues that poets all over the world are endeavoring
to voice and deliver.*<http://act.rootsaction.org/p/dia/action/public/?acti=

(I asked Maria Damon to work with me, she wrote
a text, which I mangled. Azure and I played while
Maria spoke and improvised from the text. The
piece, quite beautiful I think, is below, followed
by three short musical compositions I improvised as
auxiliaries or retunings. The Maria text follows.
I should say I've been influenced by surbahar and
Karnatic music in the playing. And thank you Maria
and Azure!)

Poems!

An old friend in FL wanted to hear what the parking lot scene at Phish sh=
ows
sounded like, sooo...=20

I recorded some audio of me reading an excerpt to one of my Phish parking=

lot poems and posted it here: http://bit.ly/WRXDjA

"Poems," I said. "Phish Lot sounds a lot like poems!"

The piece I recorded, SET I, is from the book: JAMBANDBOOTLEG.

Happy holidays,

You are invited to a performance by

*
The Axial Trio

**David Arner*(keyboard & percussion)
*George Quasha* (percussion)
*Charles Stein* (voice)

*Thursday, December 27th 2012
*8:00pm
at the home of George Quasha & Susan Quasha
124 Station Hill Rd.
*Barrytown, NY
*RSVP

The Axial Trio has been performing together since 2010, including
performances Upstate and in NYC.

Axial music, as distinguished from improvisation as often practiced, is
not happy recycling in new arrangements what one already knows too well
how to do. Rather, it aims to release our listening habits,
expectations, and taste by discovering â€œliving soundâ€ in each instant,
unprecedented to the extent possible. It allows that an emerging sound
field has its own intelligence, which one follows by listening to the
sounds themselves, as they arise. The term â€œaxialâ€ refers to an unknown
but felt center within a generative action in a given medium, and it may
apply to any kind of art. Here it refers to a somewhat mysterious
dynamic center that arises between musicians and calls them to a new
integrity of sound in the moment. Our experience is that playing music
this way gets "smarter" over time, the sound-field intelligence gets
more vivid between us. This is the experience we hope to share in our
new performance.

Dear folks

I've just received a phone from one of her colleagues and friends.
Early this morning, the poet and one of the Black Arts Movement's
premiere voices, Jayne Cortez, passed on after a sudden illness.

Please keep her in your prayers and meditation as
she travels to join other ancestors.

Greetings to my brothers and sisters Denardo Coleman just phoned me to
say that we lost out dear sister and spiritual mother Jayne Cortez.

Jayne was an inspiration for all if us. I am deeply and profoundly
saddened. It was at John LaRose's book fair in the mid 80's in London
where I first heard Jayne's poetry and I was blessed having the
opportunity to perform and record with her.

We are all in a state or mourning May God bless you all
