where does that leave Poetry In Motion? (the
brief-snippets-of-poems-posted-on-the-subways/buses phenom that one
finds in, I think, at this point, several big cities?)? --

speaking of which, said poems play a not insignificant role in the
(as one may say) hip intellectual thriller, *In the Cut*, by Susanna
Moore.  The protagonist of said novel is, among else, a linguist
living in the Village, studying the evanescent appearance of argot.

uncle david says: check it out (if you can deal with the horrible
homicides around which the tale turns) --

the closing lines of the book bring into focus (pathetically & well)
the narrator's consideration of a few such Po in Mo lines from a
Native American poem

Where exactly lies the difference between writing in a "bachelor"
("studio") apartment, and writing in a mall, as far as writing method
goes? I was going to use the word "private" to begin a usual way of
describing where that difference might lie but it then occured to me:
what can "private" mean if there isn't a viable "public" nomores?
Isn't walking from apartment into mall walking from small *private*
space with media in it into large *private* space with people and
media in it? In a way, only that. But: "private" continues to have
some *relative* merit as a site from which new disclosures are
made, just as "public" can still be *thought* ... and, besides, am I not
being empirically obtuse in refusing the distinction?

Is there not instead, however, a useful distinction to be found
between writing where-ever you are, and writing for pay where-
ever you are (and then a further distinction within the latter)? This
is what some on the list recently suggested to be the case with
regards to poets in places other than their rooms.

Once upon a time in the land of the late '80s Michael Dennis was an
Ottawa poet without a job. (Ottawa... a small government town
about the size of the postcard you can get from it declaring itself a
country's capitol.) Michael Dennis used to sit at a cardtable in the
window of a used bookstore on -- appropriately enough -- Bank
Street, at a typewriter, writing at at at poems for his next chapbook.
One poem I remember is about how his girlfriend kicked him out of
their shared place because she smelled someone else on his
moustache.

Think of, not moustaches, soaked in rum & orange, & thighs, but
rather, Michael's way of orienting himself in what you have to kind
of fill-in to imagine as the commoditized social space of a gentrified
block of small shops. Michael's social-space "orientation" is, I think,
different from that Dan Davidson is purported to have brought to
writing his incredible book, *Product*, in a mall. In contrast to
Michael's, Dan's "orientation" would seem to be as a nonperformer
anonymously assuming any seat in the mall, ethnography-style.
There is a kind of immediate *symbolic* payback Michael gets
from his orientation within social space -- and from the social space
itself (and on its own terms) (and at his former girlfriend's expense),
that Dan does not get from the way *he* "occupied" his social
space. Dan takes on the social space of the mall as the very subject
matter of his poem: subjectivity becomes an objectified labour
mystified by the commodity form as that form especially pervades the
mall environment. Whereas, occupying a window as a live
mannequin that types, advertising one's life as the next attraction
besides the store, seems to only make the commmodity form come
more mysteriously to life in his own person.

What, in other words, would one hope to achieve by being paid to
"be a poet" in, say, a laundromat, or at NASA, as some have
suggested on this list? -- Fans? -- A moustache? -- Proof that
absurdist interstices exist achronically and that you have found one
of them?

Yet perhaps there *is* a role for the poet with personality to sell,
now (that is, for poets way-way younger than Vozneshensky, and,
moreover, way-way past the Cold War trip). But then compare
"being a poet" working for NASA with "being a poet" working for
a literacy project, or working as a poet in a car plant (as someone
suggested), a school, prison, or community centre. Aren't they two
different ideological orders of work? Isn't there (or can't one
"say" this anymore) a different understanding of what language is as a
medium, implicit behind each of these two orders of paid poets?

*Is* there a difference, then, between Dan stepping outside of a
domestic writing-space in order to self-reflexively address the rules
themselves of social space such as they manifest themselves in a
mall, and Michael simply using the rules of a space to elevate
himself before a gaze of the abstract Buyer much as if he was
standing before his bedroom mirror? What might a Return of the
Living Beat Poet, post politics, mean?

It remains the case for me that the performance of the social space
of the mall ca. late-80s gets refracted -- very live -- in *Product*,
but the performance of Michael's personal life in the shop window
on Bank Street remains purely anecdotal, despite his chapbook.

Michael's used store at least had poetry on the shelves -- which
lead to some social ironies. Right opposite the used bookstore
with the poet typing in the window was another bookstore. This
other store sold new books and magazines of left, left-left, radical-
left political persuasions. It was run as a cooperative. It barely had
any poetry books. A novelist was employed there. Yet I was a good
friend of the novelist's; whereas, I was only the vaguest
acquaintance of the poet's. Yet I bought more books from the store
with the poet in the window. Yet I have no fucking idea why I am
writing this excruciatingly dull and long discursive and mechanical
post anymore, and in such a turgid style too, stalely remembered,
with probably overall misplaced determination -- I need air bad;
whereas, *Capital* vol. 1 chapter 1 sits open to the left of my
screen, like a window onto

I was going to say something brilliant but by the time I'd logged-in I
forgot it. This must be the opposite of staircase wit. Imagine, finding
oneself on-line on-List with no apparent purpose." Oops--sorry!" As though
one had blundered upon others better organized, persons aware of just where
their creds are at this point in the evening. All over the bed, like coats
and scarves.

I find Tom Beckett's advent upon us, miraculous. In the most everyday sense
of that term. Like, the landscape altered. In a twitch of a lid.

It had had to do with the application of poets. To getta job. Anyone who
knows me, knows I would fit this role well. But noone who knows me is able
to make me the offer. I wonder, how can one be a poet and meet the
credentials for this kind of application of what one happens to be?
Usually, when I gotta job, I hid the poetry part. The plane trees had been
recently polled, beside Barclay's Bank of California.

O, I remember what I wanted to say. George Bowering was looking good in the
lingerie department, and he used to sprawl there and scribble away.  But
SFU with a 5-million-in-90-years contract, lured him away from Hudsons Bay
Company.

I didn't call them crooks, Henry. Glass of Green Tea is ok, except that
there's a lot of read-through because the paper is rather light, but the
two samples they sent me were really appallingly bad printing.

I must have misunderstood. I thought the poet-in-residence at a commercial
concern would be a sort of poet laureate, expected to write occasional
verse. "Ode to a C-cup," and the like.

It all sounds pretty compatible to me. Why not publish a poem on a sidewalk or
bus?
Think of Jenny Holzers early work.

Incidentally, I like Susanna Moore's fiction. But particularly the Hawaiian
novels.

Im reminded of when the xerox machine first invaded, its cheap access
spawning (& still) a notion of publishing more anarchist than
democratic, & how many years it took for xerox to be legitimized as a
valid form of publication, especially in the eyes of libraries, buyers &
archives.  The accessibility allowed everyone to try their hand at
publishing "editions".  This initiative, however, was far more
successful in the zine world (very little of which contains the type of
content discussed here), that in the literary small press, partly
because the monstrous enigma of the printed book is unscalable,
unoverthrowable, xerox publishing has largely remained ephemeral &
marginalized, nee mimeography.

I see the web as an entirely different beast.  Rather than comparing it
to print media, I prefer to compare it to broadcast media & networking.
Also I think it is a mistake to think that content is the only marker of
successful netmedia.  Poor layouts, bad code, cliche devices, lack of
vision & promotion, & understanding of what makes hypermedia an
evolution in information delivery & retrieval will all play a part in
sustainability of the digital inflorescence.

Since I dont have a feeling of this readership's knowledge of the
computer industry & what is available, there is one vision that has been
around for many years, perhaps began in diginfant days of the Media Lab,
of books & objects transmitted via the net, to be reproduced via
intelligent printers which will print, collate, bind & deliver a book at
the click of a button, & of course, the technology exists to do the same
with extruded 3-D objects. & as with most research technology, it is
poised to be released only at the point when the "consumers" are ready
to invest in the next best thing.

In response to Joel Kuszai's post ("NOW we might think of clustering critial
interests around volunteeristic/careeristic editors who would do the labor of
assembling the texts. As Loss pointed out (here/there) the actual markup for
this activity would be relatively easy and done at the EPC home office, so no
real html experience would be required"):

I agree, but would suggest further:
1. why doesn't each of us volunteer for such work, since it can all be
attached to email as text files, and
2. why do it only at the EPC home office, for the same reason?

Most of us on this list have access to a computer (or we couldn't be on this
list unless your only access is through computer labs and such) and there are
HTML editors that can be downloaded online (AOLPress, for example, is quite a
handy one).

Let's spread out the work, not burden any one person with this, AND get more
people published, even if "only" online. Hell, let's get social! Think of it
as a webbing bee.

ok. thanks Kcglowworm for your suggestions about "each of us" getting the
business done. i have some comments and some rather silly questions
perhaps, but there might be people on this list who can help. first, back
to George H's post:

> I agree, but would suggest further:

1. one thing in reply here. As someone who owns two computers that don't
work (floppy disk drives broke), the use of the network has meant digital
survival. sending docs via attachments or thru ftp or fetch has been
crucial to all my projects. I can upload at school files and disks and
then pull them down at home to edit, print, etc. Anyhow--and more on this
question, as the network extends  where I can continue a healthy
percentage of my business, both on-line and off. It reminds me of when I
was in college (late 80s) when I didn't own a computer and relied on the
school labs. luckily they were open24hrs. now i'm glad when the door to a
computer lab is locked, some kind of institutionally mandated form of
situationist intervention.

1.b

George, a simple technical reminder which gets to the heart of the issue:
please remember not to send attachments to the poetics list address, as
not everyone has an email reader which will allow for this to be
accomplished with any success, and also, people on the digest feedbag i
think will have it worse as I can't even imagine howthe digest file
handles attachments. And on that note, i find that not everyone I deal
with on the network can really handle or access the technology required to
work with attachments. this can and will be something that is overcome,
but because I am barely/not quite able to do all of the things with a
computer that I need to, I'm not always able to help.

All that aside, there are so many ways around the issue of attachments so
the on-line collaboration is a possible pathway here to getting the EPC
author page webs done. More of George:

some technical questions. right now (and I'm hoping this changes) i am
running a mac2cx with mucho memory and a new hd, but it is slow and its
brain fizzles whenever it enounters anything new in the software vein. i
use netscape 2.02 and tried to use eudora but it woldn't have it. i write
my code out in my notebook then type it into the computer, but eventually
it wouldbe nice to export text to html or wave a magic wand over an essay
and have it marked up. I've sampled a variety of html looks and feel that
the basic template is really simple and thus easily taught--anyone who
remembers dos or reveal codes will have a gas with html...but, and here's
the ringer, eventually i would like to automate some of this html
generation and was wondering if there was software out there (like a cheap
html editor). GH mentions aolpress but that takes up so much memory. I use
HTML Pro (which could really use an update) which is nice because you type
in one window and behind it another code magically appears. it's good for
getting the logic, solving problems, etc., but is fairly limited. I am new
to all this and so I ask, should I keep working it out by hand, developing
my html vocab, or is there a good editor that I can use that doesn't
require a powrmac or an 040 chip?

sorry for the technical delay, now back to our debate:

Joel,

As somebody mentioned (Tom B., I think), Netscape 4's "Composer" is very easy to
use.
You can get a copy of Netscape for $30.  AOL Press is also excellent.  I'm pretty
sure you can get that for free.  (In fact, you can get almost anything for free, of
course...)  I think you'd have to have Windows 95 for these programs (and that's
some money, _generally_...) and for Windows 95, you might need more memory, but a
coupla gigs are only a coupla hundred dollars.

Someone else mentioned 3D for books--yep, I think this is _very_ close.  Am gearing
up to try it myself, in fact.  Just went out and purchased Caligari 3D Truespace.
Anyone with the time and ambition could not only make a book, but a virtual library
as well.  It's all coming very soon.

P.S. Totally Shameless Reading Series Promotion: My own first site, just beginning,
was done on Netscape Composer.  The URL is http://www.vom.com/stills.  This next
Monday's readers are Steven Farmer, David Bromige, and Peter Gizzi.  They'll be
presenting "A Troubadors Panel Discussion" and reading from respective poetries
much influenced by the troubs.  According to one Socopoets member here in Sonoma
Cty., I've got Jehovah's Witnessess walking around Santa Rosa talking up this
reading (see latest issue  of "Awake," smile), but they must be doing it on a
volunteer basis.

when i teach these two writers in the same course, or acker and a number of
others in the same course (which goes by various names: weird books by
women, women and the literature of trauma, women and experimental writing,
etc) i usually offer a bifurcated model of both postmodernity and general
trauma writing (but, w/in the framework of the courses, women's trauma
writing, which in addition to historical trauma also includes the more
--tho by no means exclusively of course --gendered phenomena of sexual
abuse and sexual violence); there's the "hysterical mode" and the "flat
affect mode", both of which are discernible modes in trauma survivor
accounts and the styles characterized as "postmodern." it's cool to find
that others are working on similar matters.

The Transcendental Friend
http://www.morningred.com/friend

(A journal of poetry, poetics, art & criticism.)

Updated on the first of every month, The Transcendental Friend will present
several regular sections, including A Critical Dictionary, The Bestiary,
Dialectic, and a Project. (Additional sections will be introduced in future
issues.)

Something like the Princeton Encyclopedia were it edited by Bataille,
Coleridge & Kierkegaard, perhaps, the Critical Dictionary will present
articles on topics of a quasi-technical nature; our first entry is on
"Sincerity," by Duncan Dobbelmann.

The Bestiary is a joint project of Laird Hunt & Eleni Sikelianos; this
month's Bestiary features work by Lisa Jarnot, and is edited by Laird Hunt.

The whole of theory in a single frame, Dialectic, will offer texts in the
moment of dialectical fissure. Our first issue presents a longer
investigation of the question about the nature of "poetics" in the form of
a brief survey of the literature.

We are pleased to present in our first issue a Project by artist Dennis
Thomas, combining exquisite graphite on paper drawings with texts by the
entomologist, Henri Fabre.

This is primarily for Miekal And, but I thought others might like to know .
. . . . Don't know why I was that overdressed the day my son Chris took
that (cover of THE DIFFS #3) pic, perhaps had some "square-world" function
to attend, but if you would care to see a pic of me UNDERdressed, plus
others of me with friends & relatives, let me refer you to the Contemporary
Authors "Autobio" series, published by Gale Resarch in Detroit, vol. 26,
which should be in yr local college libary by now (and includes also
autobios by Sheila Murphy, Carl Djerassi, Ed Foster, David Meltzer, Sarah
Menefee, Stephen Schwartz, Nanos Valaoritis, C.K.Williams, Michael Bishop,
Dorothy Bryant, Victor de Suevo, Richard Harteis, Marvin Himestra, Leza
Lowtiz, Thomas Love Taylor, and [a corker!] Julia Vinograd.) Earlier
volumes have much to offer also. One of my faves is George Bowering's.
Another is Anselm Hollo's. A third is Rae Armantrout's, although I wish _I_
could have written it about her, so that it might go beyond her 24th year.
I've read in proof Ron Silliman's, a brilliant coping with the assignment,
which must be forthcoming shortly. Check out Listmaster Bernstein's piece
in a previous volume, too. He elected to use an interview. The approaches
can be quite various, happily, although many go for the linear perspective.

Also,like others on this List, I have an upcoming entry (about my writing)
due to be published in April in the DLB series from Gale. Don't know how
long your college library will take to acquire and process this volume, the
2nd, I believe, to result from our own Joseph Conte's perspicacious hard
labor.

It would be great to see such accounts of EVERYBODY, stashed
electronically. I'm sure Miekal And doesn't resemble my mental image of
him, either, but I'm willing to shatter that ikon on the rocks of a more
common reality. Besides, I enjoy my invented poets also, it's hard to
surrender them to my curiosity. But I got in so much hot water last time I
proposed we each invent the poet from the poetry that I better quit right
now. I confess that I do read bios and autobios like crazy and I was only
quacking idly with my squib abt wally stevens a year ago. Truth is stranger
than fiction. Did you know Doris Day slathered Vaseline all over herself
once a week, then swathed herself in Saranwrap so she could get a good
night's sleep w/o staining the sheets?  That she went w/o sex for 3 years?
That one of her legs is longer than the other? Or closer to home, that
Sheila Murphy likes to eat gorp, a mixture of Virginia peanuts, slivered
almonds, shaved coconuts, and raisins? That the first word of Bowering's
autobio is his wife's name?  That Stephen Schwartz was named after Stephen
Spender? That Ed Foster published under the name Retsov?  That when she was
9, Sarah Menefee was converted by a blind Baptist who had been struck by
lightning? That my great-grandfather was murdered by poachers?  That Ron
Silliman spent his first acid trip (it was still legal then) on an
apartment building rooftop, just for the heck of it taking apart a TV
aerial?  And that it was the night his father was fatally injured? And Jack
Spicer died?

Joel,

I was reluctant to give up the html handcoding, but there's a big world
of wysiwyg editors out there & they save lots of time & let you move on
to bigger & better, etc.

There are plenty of editors you can download off the web as trial
products--usually for 30-60 days. If you want to learn lots of
interfaces, you can probably avoid buying anything indefinitely!

HotMetal Pro (Is this what you mean by HTML Pro?)was my choice for the
transition from hand to wysiwyg. It "thinks" like a person. NetObjects
Fusion is rather a poetic program, by which I mean it can do ANYTHING,
if only you can think associatively & attune yourself to its rationale.
My favorite, though, is Front Page, but that's Microsoft--and lots of
people won't deal with them, though anyone who wants to debate the
god/bad (typo but I'm keeping it) Microsoft issue is welcome to
backchannel me :)

The newer Word version has html-export capability, and I imagine that's
true for the MAC version as well.

Good luck!

Yes, you can download AOL Press free.  You can also run it (if you get the

Mark, I wasn't responding to your post.  We chose the Green Tea paper carefully
& decided that the lightness & strength (in a very long book) was what we

There is a lot of material already available even though it is not organized.  I
have informally gathered URL's for a number of individual and collaborative
sites.
I think this is an important direction to look into.  But I do have a strong
personal reaction to the idea of orgAGAGG ation (guess my hand does, too).

Miekal,

my ancient asian scenes are no less stale than those of dreamtime village.
I wonder as I spend my mornings with you all and what you offer how I will
coerce my poetic friends to consider what these infernal machines can do for
us in the land of eternal traditional culture.  Is anyone on this list in

        Well, some of the questions raised by this thread, especially as
regards web-rings (meta-zines through aggregation), and the preference of
pages to web-pages are addressed in multiple ways in Michael Joyce's book,
"Of Two Minds"  --  see also his web page, the url of which I haven't got
on hand just now.  I wish I'd WRITTEN IT DOWN somewhere.
        As far as the writing is concerned, I'm currently writing my first
poem in hypertext and staring into the screen I find helps align me with
the structure of the piece, somehow.  In most cases, I'd rather read the
printed word (which is why I publish my journal Kenning in that
money-losing format), whereas I write to the screen and generally feel
uncomfortable when I cannot.  That's my vote.

wanting to chime in on two current streams here

yes--more people should publish chaps/mags be they in print or electronic.
publishing helps create communities. in the 12 plus years i did NRG, a
tabloid with a strong stylistic bias, many contacts wre made among the
contributors, including folksl like johm m bennet, jeffrey little and ivan
arguelles. my project for the last couple years, 26 books, focusses instead
on this region (pacific northwest) and has create a web among those writers
ive published, as well as helping my rep and possibilities in the region.
just think if everyone published 6 or 9 issues of a mag how much would be
out there to cross pollinate and -promote!

as for where you write, i write when it comes to me, which is usually after
an event like a movie or a reading. i'll sit down outside the theatre ro
wherever, sometimes walk a block or three before more words come and i have
to stop and write more. also i do word sketches--which seldom become
poems--watching and listening to people in places like bars and coffeehouses.

What I find energizing with epublication is the potential for bottom-up
accretion of knowlege, people, pages, etc.  Top-down still has a place
but I was never much for _Dictionaries of (_____) Literature_, authorative
guides, etc.  I have started my own heap of sweepings.  Anyone interested
in connecting with, contacting, touching on this, _The Most Bueatiful

Also, picked up Jeff Clark's -The Little Door Slides Back- yesterday, which

Duncan wrote "This Place Rumored to Have Been Sodom" on the SF Muni buses, and
Whalen and Blackburn both wrote works obviously composed likewise on public
transit, which were important precedents for my writing when I was younger.

First instance I can think of, though, of a poet writing in public would
probably be Pound in the wire cage in the mud at Pisa.

In its court-affiliated forms and in numerous other social contexts
traditional Chinese poetry was very much a performance art.  A bunch of
courtier poets would be trailing the Emperor and when he would propose a
topic, everyone would compete to come up with the best poem.

On a somewhat lower social level lots of poetry would be composed on the
tongue in bars at parties, and frequently written up on the wall by the
author or whoever had the best calligraphy.

Part of the point of inviting Li Bo (Li Po) over for drinks and dinner
was to watch him come up with a poem, and compete with the other poets
in the neighborhood.

Of course this is writing in public in a different sense from Duncan,
Whalen or Blackburn on the bus, where they are outside and in a public
space, taking in but not necessarily displaying themselves in public.  G.
Apollinaire is an earlier example, e.g. Lundi Rue Christine.  Edwin
Denby's aesthetic was "in public in private" and might be considered to
devolve from the same issue.

Can one be both, writing in a public location privately and at the same
time performing publicly?  Maybe the second poem in my chapbook "At
Baoshan" would be an example.

Though it was not an issue _entirely_ dedicated to Dahlen, in 1986
_Ironwood_  (v14 n1) published a lengthy feature on her, including some
sections of _A Reading_ as well as four or five appreciative essays, one by
Duncan and one other by DuPlessis.  I know that was the first place I'd
encountered her work.

Henyr!

Thank you for mentioning the name of my press, Goodbye Books. In honor of
the happy coincidence, and as is the custom on this list, please permit me
to sell something!

Steve Malmude's book got a tremendously respectful (n.b. not fawning!)
review in Lisa Jarnot's News Letter. John Godfrey said among other things
that art comes to this poet, not he to it, and that there are certain
things the poet says which are none of the reader's business!

I'll send out a copy of this letterpress book free to the first person who
e-mails me with their street address (it'll take me a week or so -- I have
to go fold them together). The next nine people can have it for $10 ppd.

Read it now or read it later,
Jordan

I haven't finished reading through the weekend's posts yet....Very likely
I'll find that someone said something like this, but..I feel rather
strongly moved by the cyber-spirit to say:

*In extension of stuff Tom Beckett has said, and several others have
nodded to:  I'm made *very* uncomfortable by the fact that the websters
don't quite see how the immediate poetry-community structure has become
split.  This will be a temporary, and rapidly evolving situation.  But it
is going to exist in some form for some time.

*I know important and dynamic poets, writers, and readers of poetry who
don't have much (or any) access to web and net modalities.  This makes a
huge difference as resources get shifted to cyberspace.

*Eventually, public libraries will provide something apporaching
half-adequate resources for accessing "non" and other great
cyber-publications.  But this will continue to be a troublesome option, in
relation to the hours poets can manage to spend in their public library,
the ambiance and ability to concentrate, etc., & very importantly: their
ability to submit if paper submissions are not accepted for electronic
venues.  Etc.

*Already (in a way many folks who've just posted apparently don't see)
there is a large split between cyber-empowered poets and others; a gradual
evolution of a two-tier structure in what had been a purely paper culture
not long ago...

Owen and Sassoon wrote in the trenches in France. Another horrible public
experience. Perhaps one of the keys to our time is poets writing in public
voluntarily and publicly.

Robert Hass, the recent poet laureate, pledged to write poetry whenever he
used public transportation. The rub is that there is so much busywork to
being the PL that he had to write when travelling or not write at all. We
take a working poet (mainstream or not, a working poet), make him/her the
PL, and then sentence her/him to millions of meetings with Rotarians...

Alright, then. I'm certainly willing to pitch in.
(it's sort of like a barn-building, no?). do we
have clearance for take-off? are there directions

go (e.g., folks that need to be covered asap =96
any chance we can see Loss' list?). there are
some serious omissions =96 it's too much to
expect one or a few folks to build a very large
edifice. I guess we can all see what the template
is for the pages, shall we begin?

shhhh =96 rattletrap. ok, I'm ready.

I can do a Spicer page (unless...), a page for
Peter Ganick, and Linda Russo and I can col-

willing to do others, too.

Subject:      You Too Can Edit a LitMag (or can you?)

Unless you're loaded, publishing a little mag takes craft, energy and
imagination.  That's enough to go on.  You either obtain a photocopier or make
friends with someone who has access to one.  Distribution is a problem, but
there are creative ways to get the things out once they're ready.

At Mike and Dale's, we lovingly letterpress each cover.  Each issue is designed
with attentive skills by an artist who willing devotes his time to our little
cause free of charge.  (Check out those EXPLOSIVE covers too, silk-screened
and gorgeous).

We set the type in Quark and I'm alwayspicking up design tips from graphic
design folks.  My first mag was an awkward clutter of poems.  But over time
I've managed to make it look as good as any pub.  If we had the money I would
ideally have each issue offset and perfect bound.  But M&D, EXPLOSIVE and other
little zines have a rough beauty to them.  At least I like to think so.  You
almost have to think so with all the time that goes into it.

Soliciting materials is easy.  You contact poets and read their works.  Take
what you can use and return the rest.

E-publications suck.  But it looks like the future, in many ways, for poetry's
market. Stillthe web is a medium every poet should hate.  It limits the value
of physical production.  It limits the mobility of the product, tying the
reader to one location, for me, often at work.  It lacks the correlating
physical materials that provides support to the word, reminding us of poetry's
very tactile relation to the world, not to our own inner subjectivity.  It
promotes every kind of self indulgence becaue it is easier to reproduce
inferior work.  If you have to set type, line up each page, produce it, copy
it and bind it you're gonna want to present poetry of the highest quality.  On-
line you might be tempted to publish lesser works because there is less
time and money invested in it.  Finally, the idea that the web is democratic
in any way is way off.  There are still two communities out there.  Printed
and online communities.  For many, these areas cross.  For many, they don't.
Ideally you'd want to share work with both groups.  That's a problem.

For me publication is about the work.  And the best way to present that work
is still the book.  It gives a shape and coherence to the work.  The web
leaves that shape undefined.  The book is the vehicle for this work we do.
Without that, we are only addressing each other in a void.  Noise results.
Did somebody say something?

This might be the type of question where the answer is, "if you have to
ask, you'll never know," but what are some of the many ways one can go
about setting up a magazine? I'm talking about the material questions
here: How much does it cost? How cheaply can it be done? How do you handle
the printing? The distribution? The rejection notices? How do you choose a
name, for instance? Do you get institutional funding, or do you go it
alone? Etc...

Along these lines, I'm about halfway through Michael Cuddihy's memoir,
_Try Ironwood_, about his late lamented magazine. It's great, but
these questions have gone unasked in that book (I get the feeling he had
access to money besides the NEA grants -- not that he was living on easy
street given his illnesses, of course, but money didn't seem to be a
problem for the mag).

So Poetix folks: I know full well some of you HAVE your own mags
and have been dying since this thread has started to talk about them.
Here's your chance: Any how-to advice? Horror stories? Success stories?
etc etc.

Just a note to say I don't think the split between cyber-empowered and
acybric poets too important.  To me it's like the split that occurred
years back between typewriter-empowered and pencil poets.  All kinds of
adjustments are going on, like access to computers at libraries or one's
workplace or school.  Friends with computers should be available, too.
And I suspect that equivalents of Kinko's will pop up where you can scan
hard copy onto disks cheaply.  Indeed, I wonder that Kinko's doesn't
already offer such a service.  Maybe it does.  Plus, being cyber-
empowered isn't all that big a deal right now: poetic cyber-space is too
disorganized and hard to get around in (at least for me, still in my
first year in cyber-space) for it to be much of a factor.  It DOES let
one communicate much more easily and cheaply with people on the net,
which is a plus--but no more empowering than having enough money for
long-distance phoning is for some poets (never me).  My final thought is
that the cyberization of poetry is among the least of the huge number of
problems facing serious poets.

I dont believe that web publishing is creating any new schisms that
havent already existed.  Since I began publishing other's books in the
late 70s there has always been visible divisions between letterpress,
the xerox crowd, & the shinycovered perfect bound crowd.  My feeling is
that it is just such divisions which make the challenges of wholeness &
continuity in the larger community of the printed word separate
parallels which need be continually juggled & mixed up.  The advent of
the web, is simply yet another way to enhance dissemination.

I seriously propose that we think of the web as a broadcast medium, that
there become web surrogates who create hardcopy from web content (& it
has the possibility of becoming a whole new book art in itself) for just
such isolated cases.  The reverse of course, hard copy going cyber, is
finally happening at a rate that would make Theodor Nelson proud.

as a community of about 10-20 people we jointly bought a computer &
access, which really didnt amount to that much money per person.  I
firmly believe that when possible, it is best to be independent of
libraries & institutions because individuals cannot control access
(unless perhaps if yr faculty or employee)...

My reading of this shift is that there has been & always will be splits
of power & prominence, but when I consider that most of my own books
have been in editions under 200 copies, & most are hidden in special
collections & people's dusty shelves (or my dusty shelves, anyway), &
most of my websites are getting at least 200 hits per month, I feel like
the split that has never been in my favor (or even the larger
communities that Im part of) is finally getting a chance to find
visibility & balance.

rather than issue a once-and-for-all edict re new media (as dale has just
done, and he's in good company---three nobel laureates have made similar
claims, as has andrei codrescu):

listen folks:  if you could only SEE the strings attached to those hunks of
paper out there we all call *books*...

well you CAN:  just have a close look, real close now, and ask how that
thing got in your hands, start to finish...

the web, the internet, is part of the digital world---same one that brings
you (next generation) copier-printers, same one that brings you quark, same
one that brings you tv, and poetics, and rice crispies (hey---think about
it)... print and broadcast media combined becomes something else again,
good and bad and in-between (it's human, for chrissakes)... turning one's
back on this as a poet is worse than retro, now that so many poets have
migrated into these regions... the access questions are not going to go
away---EVER... anymore than the food questions will... perhaps broadsides
will be the way to go in places where people can't find enough to eat---you
tell me...

but the larger issues re poetry and poetix really do have to do with how to
make do with what each has (access to and so forth)... now how about that,
huh?---all on this list have (as mark p indicates) different levels of
access... but we're all here, somehow, variously connected... now we can
activate to get others online, however... but to argue against doing things
with the online resources at hand?---someone please explain to me how this
is either necessary or desirable?... and how this is *not* a reactionary
gesture, finally, in the face of those sundry realities that currently
shape print publishing (nothing against the latter either)...

Mark P.'s reference to "the ability to concentrate" is I think central. The
experiences of reading on-line and on paper are decidedly different.
Scrolling, and the insistent light-source, enforce an in-the-moment reading
that makes of the poem a transitory thing, and poetry written with the web
in mind is likely to remake itself for that requirement. The equivalent of
sound-bites, one after another. One can write good poetry within those
constraints, but most poetry unfolds, beyond first acquaintance, slowly,
and the casual referencing at the oddest moments to this or that line or
section effectively restructures the experience of reading the poem,
deepening one's penetration of the text, one's pleasure in the experience,
and expanding its structure. Books facilitate this. A new book of poems is
likely to sit on the floor by my bed for a long time, or travel with me in
a pocket (the joy of paperbacks). I finally "got" Creeley, for instance, in
bars and public parks, and "The Opening of the Field" went with me on a
backpacking trip to the Adirondacks. The point is, or a point, anyway, is
that the kind of concentration required for the reading of poetry is not,
in my experience, summonable at will--it's rather akin to the energy
required to write a poem (which is one reason why work by a poet unknown to
an editor has a harder time making it past the gate the first time out).
It's hard to remain available to those moments if a computer is required.
There's also the way the book falls open. The beginning or end of the poem
accesses the poem on the facing page, and one journeys through becomes a
series of discoveries, orchestrated by the poet or editor's ordering of the
poems. And this is instantly visible, not only as a succession of lines,
but as a structure on a page and on successive pages perceived whole.
Then there's the question of design. When I design a book the poems seem to
tell me, after prolonged meditation (and of course within the limits of my
finances and design experience), how they should look. This selection of
paper, the texture of the cover, etc., details that I don't think a
computer print-out can replicate. Even the kerning of the text--how much
randomness to allow--is determined by the character of the material.
A computer, for me, is a convenient way to sample a range of work. If I
like it, I'll buy a book.

---------------------------------------------------------------
I'll start with two cliches:
Seeing epublication as a kind of demo-utopic option is not an option.
Bottom-up is exactly how top-down structures are built.

Let me put that another way.  E-word is certainly different from ink-word.
But both are themselves radically different -- different in kind, not
degree -- from the spoken word.  Trying to cultivate some new utopia in
the tiny valley between e-word and ink-word strikes me as just more
neophilia. The impulse toward abandoning books in favor of screen for some
sense of community or non-traditional community is understandable, but the
screen is a highly privatizing mechanism, serving only to remind us, in
the words of Kavanagh, that we "aren't alone in our loneliness." Spicer
kept insisting that we never lose sight (?) of the voice:

"They [New Critics] have taken poetry (already removed from its main
source of human interest -- the human voice) and have completed the job of
denuding it of any remaining connection with person, place, and time....
        Live poetry is a kind of singing.  It differs from prose, as song
does, in its complexity of stress and intonation.  Poetry demands a human
voice to sing it and demands an audience to hear it.  Without these it is
nake, pure, and incomplete -- a bore." (This lifted straight fr Hoover's
Norton, including ellipsis.)

To say then that it's in great part a matter of how many have access to
computers is sort of crazy: that's just another version of that very weird
and very American impulse to have MORE THINGS (if we just had more things
-- more computers, more laptops, more and softer and smaller gatches so we
can curl up in bed with them!)  Waiting on MIT to come out with their next
dingie is like placing all hope for America in Flint Michigan, which of
course the nation once did: "The PC -- it's not just a computer, it's your
freedom." Come on! The proliferation of screens or books in itself neither
makes nor destroys communities: it's what, to refer back to Spicer, the
human voice dares do with those books (screens) that brings people
together or drives them apart.  If I assert that the memory of the spoken
word is much stronger than the presence of the written word (whether
type-face or pixel), would I be wrong?

THis is of course the old much-maligned binary btw spoken and written
word, but it serves a purpose when considering the new muchma-loved binary
btw ink and e-word.  What is inksome isn't necessarily irksome: it's HOW
something is spoken -- out loud -- it's not WHAT is said or read (whether
these are "meta-zines" or meta-meta zingy-zines or e-zippy neo-zines or
zappy zingzangy zines): a zingy zangy e-word or ink-word cannot compete
with the singy-songy of the spoken word.

Which exacerbates the previously existing split of those who have
relatively easy and cheap access to the sorts of things that come up on
this list (through university libraries with decent collections; through
poet friends; through this list; and mostly through not only being at the
right place at the right time but through knowing the right people in those
places and times) and those who don't.

I well remember my years in the wilderness when I didn't know that anything
worth reading existed (this is an exaggeration, but not by much).

Adding to Joe's post:
<< Robert Hass, the recent poet laureate, pledged to write poetry whenever he
 used public transportation. The rub is that there is so much busywork to
 being the PL that he had to write when travelling or not write at all. We
 take a working poet (mainstream or not, a working poet), make him/her the
 PL, and then sentence her/him to millions of meetings with Rotarians...


In a combo of intuition (mine) and alleged fact that someone shared not long
ago (requires substantiation), there are chemical reasons for what SEEM
spectacular results associated with writing while in motion.  Apparently (this
lore has it) the physical motion releases something (could it be the ususal
"phins" from running?) in the body that seems to induce the process of
creating.

Yours truly has had (of necessity) to write on airplanes, and have recently
taken to riding public transport whenever possible (Phoenix is not conducive
to an all-out effort in this direction YET).  I can say only that I *sense*
evidence that writing in motion is very useful and pleasurable.

Trains, of course, feel best, but we don't have them here, alas.

One of the things Edwin Honig used to say is that he became a poet
because all he needed was a pencil, it's a very portable art form.
As Dale says, a good tactile book is a work of art in itself & a joy
to be & hold; but in the end, the medium is not the message.  The
poem is the poem, the message is the message.  The poem can expand into
different media (visual, aural, conceptual), but then poems can be,
prior to all these media.  The word per se, via pencil, or lips.

I would rather read, myself, in non-cyberspace.  Easier on the eyes,
more pleasing to hold.  But as people have been saying, even reading
is changing.  Soon we'll have these little electrotalking pocketbooks,
I suppose - and you won't "click", you'll "flip". But I like the crinkle
of the dry driftwood clouds & the ink smell, and especially the glue.
The glue, the smell of composting paper from some dumpster in India.
Every book is connected to the great outdoors because it's fading
fast - that's the last breath of fresh air for both you & your book.
I lost a whole knapsack of books once on a bridge in a papermill-stinking
town in northern Minnesota - into the river they went.  Those books
were trying to return to their native home. - Henry Gould

gosh, why just two tiers? even within the community of cyber-empowered
poets, readers, students, citizens, i see or at least sense emerging
striations: writers/artists working for businesses or institutions who get
to use the newest-latest company software and hardware to construct and
distribute their work, others who get email and internet browsing, small
web pages, and that's it, others without such affiliations but with enough
income to purchase/upgrade to the hot new machines and programs, others who
pinch and save for a while only to watch as their brand new equipment gets
outmoded after 6 months or a year, others who don't have access to e-venues
by choice or by lack of financial empowerment, etc., with several possible
permutations within this latter group as well / and yes, the differences
between these cyber-artist groups create power differences, as some garner
access to technologies that others don't have

up until a few years ago, most of the reading i did was in the public and
university libraries (not as a student) because i couldn't afford to buy
the books i wanted to read (i'm super fortunate to be in San Diego where
UCSD houses the terrific new poetry archive, and that helped) / i don't see
how using public library computers (assuming they have them, i admit) is
any more a "troublesome option" than using library books -- multiple users,
time restraints, ambiance have always been a problem in libraries / and i'm
not sure if public internet machines allow this function or not, but there
is free e-mail available (and free websites through Geocities or the like?
perhaps someone who knows more could clarify) -- in fact, assuming this
free email service does still exist and can be used on a public machine, it
would be cheaper and easier to send submissions electronically than through
the mail

>*I know important and dynamic poets, writers, and readers of poetry who

i think it would be important to know why these poets, writers and readers
don't have access, how they could get it if they wanted it (if possible) /
i'm sure the stories are different, the reasons diverse, but i think it
would be wrong to think that "cyber-empowerment" necessarily requires the
right job or right income (not nec. your claim, Mark, i can only speculate)
/ i know i had to take on more work in order to save enough money to buy a
computer / i also have friends who've done similar things, or sold tv's to
pay for second-hand PC's, etc., and who make fewer long distance calls (to
friends like me!) in order to pay for phone or cable modem services / i
also remember life in a "purely paper culture" when similar budgeting (time
and resources) was necessary to get the book, go to the reading, mail the
submission, etc. / access is just as much an issue in the paper world as it
is in the electronic, and is contingent on several other things too
(geographical location, community funding), so again, i'm curious to know
why these folks don't have access

i also think those currently with better access and machines, etc., can
help out those without by web-enabling their work and sending it to e-zines
or posting it in web venues / if anyone has paper they want converted to
pixels, please send it along / which also suggests opportunities for
collaboration (revising a friend's work for e-performance, for ex) that
might serve to compress the tiers Mark describes

Miekal and others -

took short break from computer to have earth life but coming back find much
life teeming (teaming?) here as well -

As an (unemployed) eletronic archivist, I am not directly aware of the
policies of print collectors, but I think Yes it is a strategy to create
something that can be easily printed out and can be made relatively
delectable in hard copy - ( I add things to the printouts) - My experience
electronically was that there can be problems of platform - Various
hardwares becoming obsolete and the information stored in a way that is only
compatible with those hardwares becoming inaccessible -

Of course one can transfer the data to a new format - but you have then
doubled your storage needs (unless you arrive at the point of finally
trashing the original - whatever that is electronially speaking -) - You can
also spend your life transferring data - And if you have it done by a bot
you of course find yourself with too much of everything - I find I must
print out and physically file corrspondence etc for it to be of any use  -
The set of relationships one creates by making such files is an archivable
work in itself -

It seems that what we are doing on this list and one of the uses of web
rings or even just plain links is the fact of linking and quick
communication - A self-perpetuating organization occurs which is close to
being alive -  It makes up for the the lack of portability and tactility
that e zines suffer from - Although if a new e zine can have a global
readership (they of course can and do) - another kind of portability is
created -

There's no doubt that the same technology that created computers and the
Internet contributed to advanced photocopiers etc...  What I'm arguing against
is the supposed fluidity of the physical medium.  The book is the essential
communications medium for poetry.  But it's not going to remain so.  I can
imaginge an argument thousands of years ago between minstrels and scribes.
"The voice is the only true place for poetry, by Gar!"  "Duh, Wake up Homey,
Time to spread the word to more people."  The question now is whether or not
more is better.  Proliferation for the sake of proliferation.  What is the
selective process under new mediums?  Doe it change?  Will our perceptions of
the poem change in relation to new electronic mediums?  My sense of the Interne
t is that it is a vast advertising tool.  It's a perfect medium for the
advertising spectacle.  A lot of presses use the web to support their books.
Not a bad idea considering the present reality of market publishing pressures.
But as a tool for presenting the poem, the Internet is only a shell of the
book.

rather than issue a once-and-for-all edict re new media (as dale has just
done, and he's in good company---three nobel laureates have made similar
claims, as has andrei codrescu):

listen folks:  if you could only SEE the strings attached to those hunks of
paper out there we all call *books*...

well you CAN:  just have a close look, real close now, and ask how that
thing got in your hands, start to finish...

the web, the internet, is part of the digital world---same one that brings
you (next generation) copier-printers, same one that brings you quark, same
one that brings you tv, and poetics, and rice crispies (hey---think about
it)... print and broadcast media combined becomes something else again,
good and bad and in-between (it's human, for chrissakes)... turning one's
back on this as a poet is worse than retro, now that so many poets have
migrated into these regions... the access questions are not going to go
away---EVER... anymore than the food questions will... perhaps broadsides
will be the way to go in places where people can't find enough to eat---you
tell me...

but the larger issues re poetry and poetix really do have to do with how to
make do with what each has (access to and so forth)... now how about that,
huh?---all on this list have (as mark p indicates) different levels of
access... but we're all here, somehow, variously connected... now we can
activate to get others online, however... but to argue against doing things
with the online resources at hand?---someone please explain to me how this
is either necessary or desirable?... and how this is *not* a reactionary
gesture, finally, in the face of those sundry realities that currently
shape print publishing (nothing against the latter either)...

I just don't think Bob is right on a number of points he makes below.  My
original post was cautioning that this is a problem *with respect to those
publications which *are* shifting to cyberspace.*  Yes, from among the
large array of practical (and artistic) problems facing poets right now,
this one would not be chosen as in the the top 5 or ten.  But that wasn't
what was being discussed.  I can't fully interact with web and net
(especially web) oriented publishing, and know a lot of poets of whom this
is true....Bob seems maybe to have misunderstood the purpose of my post: I
just think the folks who (doing a very good job of it, by the way) are
shifting their publishing operations into c-space should be aware of the
structure of the current poetry world...

Dale, Im charmed by the soapbox yr standing on, & thank gutenberg that
there will always remain some traditionalists out there.  I think your
position is remarkable in light of what transpires minute by minute on
the web.  What I would like to know, tho, is what your feeling is about
poetic works that are net dependent (or computer dependent via cdrom),
works like hypertext, intermedia, soundpoetry, & animated poetries?  Do
these get discounted in this blanket condemnation of electronic poetics?

I'm writing this from a state university funded workstation in Buffalo,
NY. Color me privileged.

Poets shouldn't hate the web.  Luddism gets you arrested, but little else.

It seems to me an exciting time for poetry in that the web creates
the potential for not simply new (neophilial) but different FORMS of
poetry. The fact that the word e-poetry exists points to the realm of
possibility. And isn't it just this possibility for techne-cal innovation
that has driven twentieth century (if not all) poetry from the getgo?
Electronic media are not the death of the body nor of the physical world.
They are simply extensions. The body is and shall ever be here in the
world and the voice and the eyes and the you-know-what... What will change
is simply awareness of our physical parts in relation to one another and
in relation to the world.

This is neither u- nor dystopia. It is Atopia. Placelessness. The physical
body will not disappear, it will be everywhere at once.

Well, 2 pts for picking out the irony. And no need, you're quite right,
for these dang either/or's all the time: it's all, as they say, One. Om.

The binaries aren't as you say "necessary" at all -- but they're present,
insofar as there are differences btw the two media, print and etext, all
of which is implicit in some of the anteceding posts you say you missed.

To be serious, though, for a minute: the idea that epublication can become
a reliable means of awakening or creating a new nontraditional community
is a dubious one: all the talk of "meta-zines" or meta-meta zingy-zines or
e-zippy neo-zines or zappy zingzangy zines sort of misses the pt that
Spicer and so many others tried so hard to make: that _spoken_ poetry is
the lifeblood of a community. As I said, a zingy zangy e-word or ink-word
cannot compete with the singy-songy of the spoken word.

I'm not sure the current dialog condemning the online reading experience is
useful in practice. It is just too damned easy to print what you want to
read and take it with you.

Adobe Acrobat enables the writer or publisher to distribute a book of any
size, formatted in any way, to the Web, mail, ftp, etc. AT NO COST. The
person who wants to read this "book" in paper format can print the book
quickly and easily and read it EXACTLY as it was formatted, whether or not
his/her computer even supports the fonts and formatting used in the Acrobat
file. The paper file printed IS a book if the author makes it so.

Similarly, Web pages can be printed very easily. Internet Explorer allows
one to print not only the web page one is looking at, but also all related
Web pages. So one can print an entire Web site (read: book, magazine,
broadside, etc.) very quickly and with almost no mental work.

I read a great deal of stuff online. I recently read online all 50 of Sheila
Murphy's fine haibun on Bill Slaughter's web site. That is, I sat there and
read them all off the computer. It was no harder or easier than reading them
from a paper copy. If I wanted a paper copy, all I had to do was print one
and take it with me to the park, couch, or other favored reading spot.

I think we should all be honest and just say that we prefer to read books,
if we do. I do often. I see no reason to argue about whether the 'Net is
dangerously impinging on one's right to read toner on a page. It isn't. If
you prefer to read paper, in most cases you can easily, quickly, and
cheaply. Enough said.

I think the more interesting discussion has to do with the availability of
'Net technology (read: computers, modems, software, printers) to "everyone."
Obviously, if you can't afford a computer, it's hard to participate in this
Brave New World. And if you don't know enough to hack a little HTML, you're
effectively disenfranchised from the electronic printing and distribution
methods.

ON THE OTHER HAND, it makes just as much sense to argue that the truly poor
don't have the money to buy books of poetry (usually $12-$15 new), or
literary journals (usually $5-$10) either. And "they" certainly don't have
the minimum investment required to start up and maintain a printed literary
journal, which costs considerably MORE, by the way, than the electronic
counterpart.

If you are really concerned with whether the poor can read literature, why
not drop prices on your books and magazines? Or give them away free? Or
offer to donate money and time to putting out a magazine run by those
without the money and skill to do so? My magazine, VEER, or any e-zine, will
be FREE to anyone who can get to it with a computer. It will be free passed
hand to hand.

Currently one can get 486 computers virtually free. Slow modems can be had
for $20. This very small investment opens up the WORLD of the Internet,
where almost everything is FREE. Can an equal investment gain someone equal
access to the world of print media, where almost everything COSTS? Perhaps a
good question for the print-mad to ponder.

I like books. I collect first editions. I make a living as a professional
writer. But I don't for a moment suspect that someone truly in need can
afford my indulgences. He or she is left, mostly, with the library. God
bless libraries. And while he or she, this mythical "poor" person, is at the
library, checking out Pound and Williams by the crate, I hope they'll take a
few minutes to read a few literary e-zines, which are also FREE.

        Yes this is a good essay--
        I got into visual poetry actually via years of tagging (not to
mention
getting into trouble!) and it influences my work a lot still, as i use
spray paints for my works and materials found in the street
        once tagging saved perhaps my life--
        i was painting in a dimly lit alley in Boston when i saw on the
wall two shadows growing larger and larger--obviously two people
aprroaching--when the shadows were very large i spun to face one man with
a gun and another with fists drawn back--i sprayed them in the eyes and
ran off while they screamed--
        in a talk i gave at Edmonton "Eyerhymes" conference last summer I
spoke of tagging in relation to visual poetry and showed some examples
        tagging is maybe the oldest form of writing in a sense, when you
think of cave paintings and petroglyphs
        obviously, tagging is condemned because it interferes with
private property
        (though much of it is property that is condemned!)

        there was a brief period in the early eighties when tagging was in
movies and in museums--(related to hiphop esp.)--PBS even did a special
on
the great old "bombing"days in NYC--!!! provided a visual performative
interrelated language along with hip hop beats--of street life making its
own documents, rather than accept the ones written for those streets by
others--
        one of the best taggers in Milwaukee died a few weeks ago--fell
through roofing on a condemned building--
        as one of the world's oldest artforms--it will continue--
always--

i guess the same can be said about "maga-zines" too / and even more
seriously, who's competing? let's not insist on binaries in order to argue

I'm not attentive to the kinds of poetry you're speaking of.  But I think that
a poetry of the web will be something different than that of the book, or that
of the human memory.  The medium shapes the poem in fundamental ways.  There is
no such thing as a poem, that I can see, without some sort of medium through
which it reaches away from one person (or machine) to another.  Call me an old
fuddyduddy, but I'm attached to the textures, smells and visual elegance of
the page.  A letterpressed volume of verse somehow conveys an immediacy
electronic media will never approach.  Maybe we'll have to rethink our
relationship to the poem, think of it w/a more ephemeral attitude, a passing
stranger with whom we take a moment's delight.  The vacuous pleasure of e-media
does make me a bit anxious, and my soapbox is a too rickety.  Still, the
Internet has not convinced me of its possibly human potentials.  I see it

Dale, Im charmed by the soapbox yr standing on, & thank gutenberg that
there will always remain some traditionalists out there.  I think your
position is remarkable in light of what transpires minute by minute on
the web.  What I would like to know, tho, is what your feeling is about
poetic works that are net dependent (or computer dependent via cdrom),
works like hypertext, intermedia, soundpoetry, & animated poetries?  Do
these get discounted in this blanket condemnation of electronic poetics?

Agreed.  But the concern that has been expressed here is about hte notion
that associates Communities with No-placeness.  There's a certain frisson
found in yoking the two ideas, sure.  But Internet Community will never be
anything more than an oxymoron.  Oxymorons are fun. But they're not what
they say they are: we like them because they're wacky and ironic yokings,
not because they pretend to be what they say they are.  We can all
pretend, as hard as we are able, that one can have an Atopian Community.
It's a nice idea, but that's all.  Atopia is another name for hell. Read
the ol Milton. Or don't they do that in Buffalo?

If no readings took place at Black Mountain, you wouldn't have the Black
Mountain School.  STop all readings in Buffalo for two semesters and see
what happens to the morale and the mettle of that program: it'll puff into
powder.  The keyboard is nothing without that larynx above it.

RE:  What to do

Intended audience:  the lurkers and the lonely

I've been thinking a lot about the concept of the magazine as I have just put
out my second issue of Rhizome.  I believe a distinction should be made
between books that include more than one author and magazines.  Magazines
should be like snap shots of what work is currently being done.  They should
not be like museums (Arshille, Rhizome).  The art should be current and not
from some recent gallery showing.  Preferably, made for the issue.

If anyone remembers Invisible City (I was two) that Paul Vangelisti and John
McBride did in San Francisco/LA during the seventies, they managed to put a
lot work on one page, but their design was exquisite and never looked
cluttered.  I don't think magazines should be read the same way a book is.  I
also regret that times are such that it is difficult to produce any magazines
at all.

When Evan Calbi and I started Rhizome, we knew almost nothing about small
presses and lit magazines.  We had to go out and talk to people who had done
them and not until then did it makes sense to me why anyone would bother to
start a poetry magazine.  Los Angeles is a grissly national forest so even
Sun&Moon can get covered in the under brush.  But the literary magazine
community is truly awe inspiring.  What very unrich people are doing that is
high quality. If not magazines, a series of chap books like Guy Bennett is
doing with Seeing Eye (see www.litpress.com)  This guy makes his living type-
setting for Sun &  Moon and teaching French.  Paul Vangelisti's Ribot is the
sharpest magazine going in terms of design and has won awards, but he is a
part-time art school teacher.  Pays for Ribot by writting ad copy.  John
Lowther's Syntactics.  Chris Reiner's Witz.  Mark Presjnar's Misc. Proj.

At any rate, the way Rhizome is paid for is by bringing in lots and lots of
people to take over small tasks.  And to chip in with money.  This makes for
disorganization and plenty of mistakes.  It also makes us get into a room
together and talk about literature, writing, methods, design, type-setting.

I think this is sort of group activity is what Chain might be about at this
point as I know they are relying on donations and subscriptions.  It
definitely seems to be this way with Brian Lucas' Angle.

Those writers who are looking for a community might find that this kind of
publishing gets you in contact with people who think like you do and who also
challenge you.  I spent $20K on an MFA and never met a sole who had read
Stein.  I started a magazine knowing no one and now I get letters every day
from people who are doing the same thing, thinking about the same things,
telling me how to think better. As one who is leery of academia, I find that
getting to know various pubishers is a an excellent way to get an intellectual
life.  Sometimes, I think the publishers are the ones most passionate and
those are the people I want to know.

I meet or correspond with lots of younger people who ask me how they can get
their poems into magazines or whether or not Creeley will respond to their
letter.  I tell them that if they are serious about those things, they should
get a magazine going in whatever way they can.  The rest will fall into place.

Oh well enough cheer leading, there are bills to pay.

as david i. suggests, a little familiarity with the history of the printed
word goes a long way... may i recommend jay bolter's (now somewhat dated
and a bit evangelical) _writing space:  the computer, hypertext, and the
history of writing_ (lawrence erlbaum, 1991) to help flesh out the history
of writing---quickly...

but in any case, i'll make a stronger claim:  that there are things you can
do online wrt poetry and poetix that you plain CAN'T do with books... we
already know vice versa is true... but owing to this medium's relative
newness, it's not clear yet what all those things are, or might be... and i
fully anticipate, as with any new technology, new needs and new problems to
rear their ugly heads...

so if one wantsa use this medium to critique this medium, i'm all for it...
but critique is not simply skepticism---it's informed by, among other
things, some careful consideration re what's going on... sayeth the fucking
professor of english, if you like... and just saying something
sucks---dale---is not what i call careful consideration... i mean, if
you're trying to start a flamewar, that's one way... if you're rendering
your aggregate judgment after carefully weighing the issues, i guess i'll
have to take your word for it... didn't sound like it though, not to me...

here's andrei codrescu, the title essay from _the disappearance of the
outside:  a manifesto for escape_ (addison-wesley, 1990):

"The electronic media, however, operate differently.  Simultaneous,
auditory, global, tribal, connecting us all to the only job left:  moving
information.  Work disappears.  It will be done by the machines.  But which
machines?  The *lesser* machines.  We, the superior machines, will work at
becoming more of a *single* organism.  And more of a *marginal* organism.
The individual dies for the species.  The original program. Finis.  But
which species?  Theirs or ours?  McLuhan's vision makes no room for the
unpredictable, the asystemic, the imaginary.  It is a closed and closing
circuit.  It cannot foresee its overthrow, and it knows nothing of the
operation of mystery in the world.  It is not demiurgic, it is cooperative.
It conforms to its own ineluctability.  The State and rationalism (religion
before that) have always attempted and never succeeded in passing
themselves off as irrevocable, necessary, and ineluctable.  It is the task
of technology as the newest member of this directorate to finish the job."
(201-2)

he concludes the essay, and the book, with this:

"There are two global realities, resembling in a nonrepresentational way
the old programmatic realities of East and West:  the imaginary electronic
globe, and the poetic-specific-eco community.
        "The poet's job is to short-circuit the imaginary globe." (207)

i think codrescu is wise to be cautious, but his binaries are a real
problem for me, for lotsa reasons... i suspect others'll feel this way
too...

best,

The European Union commissioners have announced that agreement
has been reached to adopt ENGLISH as the preferred language for
European communications, rather than GERMAN, which was the
other possibility.

As part of the negotiations, the British government conceded that
English had some room for improvement, and has accepted a five-
year phased-in plan for what will be known as EuroEnglish (Euro
for short).

in the first year, "s" will be used instead of the soft "c". Sertainly,
sivil servants will reseive this news with joy. Also, the hard "c" will
be replaced with "k", not only will this klear up any konfusion, but
typewriters kan have one less letter.

There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when
the troublesome "ph" will be replaced with "f". This will make
words like "fotograf" 20 per sent shorter.

In the third year publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be
expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are
possible. Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters,
which have always been a deterent to akurate speling. Also al wil
agre that the horible mes of the silent "e" in the languag is
disgrasful, and that would go.

By the fourth year, people wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing
"th" by "z" and "w" by "v".

During ze fifz year, ze unesesary "o" kan be droped from vords
kontaining "ou"' and similar changes vud of kors be be aplid to ozer
kombinations of leters.

Hi All,

I haven't posted here in a very long time, but I've got some input on this...

When I was at Naropa, I used to hang out with all the Buddhist studies
folks a lot.  They loved to get drunk and write exquisite corpses in
whatever bar was available.  They probably never wrote anywhere else, but
they had a ball doing it.  I read/performed some of these poems and it
usually went over pretty well as long as I introduced it as being a poem by
"5 buddhists and a poet".  Maybe Boulder was a little different than other
towns (in fact, I'm sure it is, now being in Portland), but the other
people in the bar wouldn't even give us a second look when they saw us
writing and passing around sheets of paper, laughing.  I guess this wasn't
so out-of-the-ordinary.

Also, a couple of times, when Naropa would have some bazaar, I'd set up a
booth with a big sign reading "FREE POETRY", and would sit there waiting
for people to approach me.  Most of them would ask me, "what do you mean,
'free poetry'?", and I'd tell them to give me a word or a phrase and I'd
write a poem for them.  I wouldn't always use the word they gave me, but
I'd let their 'essence' direct me in the poem.  I'd write it just once,
right there on one page, filling it up however I saw fit.  Sometimes I was
'right on', in the sense that when they read it something would wake up in
them.  Other times, they'd just shrug their shoulders and move on.

This all felt very public to me, but a very private exchange, especially
with the free poetry booth.  So, it was a performance, I guess in
'process', but not everyone would see/hear the 'product'.

bill, The same can in many cases _not_ be said about magazines (way back
in NE America, prior to the new stamp rate, magazines were an extremely,
like, local phenomenon: it was the _physical_ presence and nearness (rabid
love affairs, thudding paperweight battles, and in one case an actual
leg-biting [no dogs involved: author bit editor]) that made them go):
physical nearness is sort of important to maga-zines.  The curious thing
about maga-zines is that a _physical_ community creates them.  Meta-zines
just don't have this: they have nothing to do with "community." Community,
I guess I'm arguing, is a totally physical phenomenon; can't be numinous
and stuff.

When it comes to maga-zines the community is already extant: the mag comes
_from it_.  Community is a PHYSICAL thing.  Now I know that a lot of folks
have a problem with the idea of Physicality. Physicality is something
we've wrestled with since, like what?, Plotinus, Augustine? further back
than that? It became THE bad bugaboo with Plotinus.  So much talk about
the internet and the great "body that is all one" (aum) is just more of
the same old neo-platonic hopes, but with some new rabidity, zippy irony,
and really fun binaries.  Not arguing gainst binaries at all: they're
great fun and quite useful dingies.  So, I hate to say this but there's
some historical residue of neo-platonic prudery and christian humanistic
prudery clinging to the common e-zippy boosterism that flows from certain
certains. Spicer was right to associate New Critics & denudedness &
non-person-ness & boredom.  NOt saying anything here about whether poetry
works well on screen or not or if books are better etc etc: saying that we
ought not place epimethean hopes in a promethean vessel.

i've been following the thread relating to this with interest...

methinks it comes down to this:
the web is good for wide opportunity and collective action. but the fact is:
we are living in a world that is quickly alienating itself from itself via
any source it can. the web is adding to this is two major ways:
                1) it gives the guise of communication, but with out any
kind of                         physical relationship between those
"communicating" with
                        each other. so no true communication can take place due
                        to a lack of viceral stimulation between the people
communicating (no body lang, eye contact, hearing a
voice, etc).
                2) with all of the voices crying out, no one is being heard.
it is not hard to see how these points relate to web-publication. esp when
you add in the fact that web related things are not "real" in the sense that
they are only bytes of information conveyed over energy waves. this does not
stand up well to an actual page or a poets voice. and tho the networking
possibilities are stagering, the easy out provided by the internet is
destroying human social interaction. and with the destruction of social
interaction, comes the destruction of art.
yet, here i am.

I dunno Joe, that noise about the new sounds a bit tinny to me; it's just so
_reflexive_. I mean, what's "new"? -- Pinsky, Rosenberg, Joyce, probably
others, have been writing in electronic spaces for ten years now . . . I'm
tempted to argue that we have a surprisingly _clear_ sense of what _a_
digital poetics is or can be, at least at this particular moment, at least
as that poetics has been self-consciously articulated by certain of its
practicioners  -- which is not to say that said poetics won't expand or
shift or dissolve, but where is the poetics that won't? I'm not really
taking exception to anything you write -- certainly not aligning myself with
the web sux crowd! Quite the opposite really, I'm marveling at how much
electronic writing there _is_ out there -- now -- new and not-so-new --
lying around on disks and drives and wondering if there comes a point where
what's new doesn't eclipse what we could _know_ from thinking/writing
about/into what we have -- what's been going around.

Or as I've suggested in other e-places, there's going to come a time, and
sooner than we think, when the challenge of preserving/porting these
earliest, oldest e-texts -- say _afternoon_ or _Mindwheel_ -- will force a
*spectacular* engagement of scholary editing and the art of the hack. Best, Matt

It's a shame to see artists rejecting new possibilities.

My thought is this: a good poem is a good poem--read onscreen, printed
out from the computer, or in a book. I particularly love the web & my
computer (which CAN go everywhere & hold alot more poetry than a steamer
trunk full of books), because I can archive material to my own taste,
instead of rummaging through all the books in my storage shed. I hate
physical clutter & have a small home. So the computer functions as my
own personal library.

     Jack Micheline dies AP.state (02-28) 19:04:21

                         Beat poet Jack Micheline dies

KARYN HUNT, Associated Press Writer

     SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jack Micheline, a Beat poet who wrote about
     society's downtrodden and called himself one of America's last
     troubadours, has died. He was 68.

     Micheline, a close friend of Beat greats Jack Kerouac, Gregory
     Corso and Bob Kaufman, died Friday of an apparent heart attack on a
     Bay Area Rapid Transit train leaving San Francisco, where he lived.
     He had suffered from diabetes for several years, his publisher,
     Matt Gonzalez, said Saturday.

     Micheline wrote more than 20 books of poetry over 40 years, forging
     a voice that captured the rhythms of street speech and various
     ethnic dialects -- half jazz, half street hustler. His subject
     matter was the poor working class and outcasts such as petty
     criminals, prostitutes, junkies and destitute artists.

     In his introduction to Micheline's first book in 1958, ``River of
     Red Wine,'' Kerouac wrote of his friend's prose, ``He has the
     swinging free style I like and his sweet lines revive the poetry of
     open hope in America.''

     Born of Russian-Romanian Jewish ancestry in the Bronx, Micheline
     read ``Studs Lonigan'' as a child and was shaken by the images of
     injustice and cruelty that he also found on his own streets. Still
     convinced poets were ``sissies,'' he didn't begin writing prose
     until the age of 24, according to a biography written by longtime
     friend Gerald Nicosia.

     Micheline identified himself with the tradition of American street
     poets, fierce rebels who often were driven to barter their poems
     for food, drink and a night's shelter, Gonzalez said. He also saw
     the poet as a revolutionary committed to freeing people from the
     slavery of unfulfilling jobs, roles and relationships.

     ``He was really the last of the vagabond poets,'' Gonzalez said.

     While he achieved acceptance in the literary world, he was known
     for a prickly exterior and for making drunken scenes at decorous
     soirees, Nicosia wrote. He might rush around the room shouting,
     ``To be alive is to lead an exciting life!'' or make rough passes
     in offensive language at proper ladies.

     In his later years, Micheline lived a spartan life on social
     security and painted more than he wrote.

     He is survived by a son, Vincent Silvaer, and a granddaughter,
     Nicole Silvaer, both of Tucson, Ariz. Funeral arrangements were
     pending.

it never even occured to me that writting in public would be discussed. it's
always seemed natural to me. i carry a notebook and a pen in my pocket at
all times.

EE Cummings once said something like, "If you like my poems, let them follow
behind you as you walk in the evening." Hard to do though if the plug gets
pulled thus the portable electronic book, which would likely cost quite a bit
more than most paper/glue versions (not to mention the upkeep for batteries,
etc). There is alot more on the non-aesthetic side of this issue. Consider the
runaway nature of profit taking in business today along with rising costs of
technology, marketing, materials, and energy. The inevitable increase in the
price of monthly on-line service year to year. The ever looming potential for
new taxes on internal usage (witness the past debate on the "bit tax"). Let's
not forget the threat of censorship -- government, corporate, or whoever(
internet snoop-doggydogs working for corporations or government). I am not an
anti-technology technologist, but the cost-benefit just doesn't exist yet for
computer poetry OVER poetry on the paper page (will it ever?) Explore/exploit
computer technology for the purposes of poetry? Yes by all means. And by all
means remain open yet sceptical to what can happen to what we have. Someone on
this list said earlier today, "enjoy it while it's free." As for Henry G.'s
interesting take on this, I am reminded of the conclusion of Ray Bradbury's
_Fahrenheit ..._ where a secret society of book lovers hides itself in the
woods from the book-burning authorities. In the absense of any books, they
recite their favorite written works to themselves completely from memory.

I don't recall yoking the words "atopia" and "community" together. I
meant simply to say that here in this placelessness you read my voice
and you might call that poetry. Might not. That's up to you. But you see
it speaking to you on the screen and thus an extension of me here in
Buffalo touches you in Indiana. Without the web you might (gratefully)
never see my voice nor I (sadly) yours. Granted, it is not the voice of
the poet speaking into your ear but neither is it not not the voice. It
is the voice you see. Relations between physical parts physical beings
change and our senses react to different sensations differently. That's
the neo in it.

I like to read your voice. It's nice. Soothing, with a gentle mocking
wit.

Atopic Synaesthesia has a nice ring to it.

Milton is forbidden in Atopia. We read Dante and wear hairshirts on

It's true it's true.

But have you heard the sound files on the epc? It's the next best thing
to spending 500 dollars to get on a plane to hear the Buffalonian
larynxes. And it's free!

Atopia is not every place.
Atopia is not some place.
Atopia is not no place.
Atopia is not place.

Atopia is placelessness.

Truly,

Standard's views on magazine publishing pretty much mirror my own. It
has,finally, more to do with epistemology than technology. It also has
something to do with risk.I distrust any art that doesn't involve a component
of risk. It may be easier to publish by website, but...  I'm not saying don't
do it.  I'm just saying don't just do that.  Taking responsibility for the
production of a physical magazine issue will teach you things you can't learn
on the web.  And Standard's written very eloquently about some of what he's
learned.  I too always advise young writers to start a magazine as a way into
finding other people to interact with as artists.

And let me say it again: this list is great if the work done here is
translated into actions in the wider world of poetry work and if we can
stimulate one another into doing things that we might not otherwise do.We can
give one another the encouragement and permission to do what needs to be done.
All this expensive technology is a box of tools--nothing more.  I'm very
pleased to have a new computer after all these years. ( Me who once thought my
used Selectric was the bee's knees. I miss it actually.)  But it's only one
tool among many.

First 2 copies still hot from printer & binder reached Jerry & me friday.
Official publication date is Poultry month, i.e. April. More news on the
book & events around it soon. Meanwhile I'm sipping some Maker's Mark ,
fondling the object -- which has a gorgeous cover by Tom Philips (from the
Humument) if I may say so myself -- pouring another Bourbon, and wondering
what to do with the rest of my life. (Well, Jerry & I have started work on a
_Collected Writings of Pablo Picasso_ for Exact Change -- so that will take
care of itself...)

BOY MEETS GIRL MEETS TRACTOR




Geographical location, community fun--
So again, Thanks to Tom Beckett for this week's signature.
Coming next week:  many folks who've just posted
public libraries will provide something
apporaching enough money to buy the guise of
communication, but with all of the crying ...





As for "collective actions," one exciting possibility that paperback-sized
nontraditional community cannot compete with the singy-songy of the zippy
neo-zines or zappy zingzangy zines. To be serious, though, for a minute:
the idea that epublication can become against them cyber-publications
wrankles the feathers of even the most average bird.  But this will
continue to be a troublesome option, don't have much (or any) access to
web and net modalities.  This makes the immediate poetry-community
structure has become purely paper culture half-adequate resources for
accessing great experiences of the whole wide world can be said about even
more inferior work.  If you have to set type, line up each page, produce
it, hard copy is going to exist in some form for some time. If you're
gonna want to present poetry of the highest quality you might be tempted
to publish lesser works because there is less market. Still the book is a
medium every poet should hate.  It limits the *very* uncomfortable fact
that seriously, who's competing? Let's not insist on binaries in order to
argue sometime within the next year.  It could be a frightening situation.
But the ambiance and ability to concentrate, etc., & very importantly:
their large split between cyber-empowered poets and others; a gradual
reduction in necessary intelligence.

Dale: I detect a strategy here, & would like to know more.  Are you saying
I haven't finished reading through the weekend's posts yet....Very likely
publishing equal to technologies that others don't have--access, which
really didnt amount to that much money per person. But critique is not
simply skepticism---it's informed by, among other things, such as
research, detailed description, analysis, and careful consideration. But
in any case, i'll make a stronger claim:  the larger issues re poetry and
poetix really do have to do with how to choose or by lack of financial
empowerment, etc., with several possible can curl up in bed with them!)
Waiting cause free of charge. Check out those EXPLOSIVE curtains. Spicer
was right to associate New Critics & drunkenness & challenge you.  I spent
$20K on an MFA and never met a sole who had read in a circuit.  It cannot
foresee overthrow, and it knows nothing of the claims, as andrei codrescu
cluttered magazines, nor should he be read the same way a book is
"communicating" with communication - A self-perpetuating organization
occurs which is close to communications medium for poetry.  But it's not
going to remain so.  I can live in communities that Im part of as long as
Im finally getting a chance to find community truly awe inspiring.  What
very unrich people are doing that is compatible with those hardwares
becoming inaccessible - I also have friends who've done similar things, or
sold tv's to replicate. Computers is sort of crazy: that's just another
version of those very weird constraints, but most poetry unfolds, beyond
first acquaintance, slowly, in the larger community of the printed word
separate, denuding it of any remaining connection with person, place, and
time....design folks.  My first mag was an awkward clutter of poems.  But
over time, destroying human social interaction. and with the destruction
of social--Did somebody say something? digitbrain

dingie is like placing all hope for America in Flint Michigan, which of
plenty of mistakes also makes us get into a room, distribute their work,
others who get email and internet browsing, small seeing Eye don't quite
see how the immediate poetry-community structure was undone, and he's
in good company---three nobel laureates have made similar E-publications
suck.  But it looks like the future, in many ways, for poetry's evolution
of a two-tier structure in what had been a purely paper culture from
people who are doing the same thing, thinking about the same things, but
I'm attached to the textures, smells and visual elegance of new problems
to get a magazine going in whatever way they can.  The rest will fall into
place in editions under 200 copies, & most are hidden in special and we
have to take your word for it... didn't sound like it though, not to
me...he concludes the essay, and the book, with this: help out those
without by web-enabling their work and sending it to e-zines Here's your
chance: Any how-to advice? Horror stories? Success stories?

here's andrei codrescu, from the title essay from _the disappearance of
the cost_: "But how am I going to get paid?"

 How cheaply can it be done? How do you handle high quality, if not
magazines, as  an argument thousands of years ago between minstrels and
scribes.  In any way is way off.  There are still two communities out
there.  Printed in mind is likely to remake itself for that requirement.
The equivalent of my experience, summonable at will--it's rather akin to
the energy income to purchase/upgrade to the hot new machines and
programs, others who do inferior work,  if you have to set type, line up
each page, produce it, copy information, work disappears.  It will be done
by the machines, which is the intended audience:  the lurkers and the
lonely

interaction, comes the destruction of art.

listen folks:  if you could only SEE the strings attached to those hunks
of zines which have a rough beauty to them.  At least I like to think so.
I'm made *very* uncomfortable by non-person-ness & boredom. Not saying
anything here about whether poetry does but whether noone notices. So
often nothing happens in academia, I find it  became THE bad bugaboo with
Plotinus.  So much talk about that e zines suffer from - Although if a new
e zine can have a global that it is just such divisions which make the
challenges of wholeness & that makes of the poem a transitory thing, and
poetry written with the web that the kind of concentration required for
the reading of poetry is not, the individual dies for the species.  The
original program. Finis.  But

There seems to be a general lack of writing and scholarship on the great Ted
Berrigan.  Personally, I feel that "The Sonnets" are amazing and it is totally
unfair that the critics have often dismissed him as a "minor" poet living in
the shadow of others, a "disciple" of Frank O' Hara, an imitator.
-Why is it that some people can't deal with his importance to 20th century
poetry?  and when will somebody get it together enough to publish "The
Sonnets" again in an edition that includes them all (not the Penguin selected
poems)  I want more.  So lets talk:;how do you all feel about Mr. Ted Berrigan
or how we can get the "Sonnets" re-published?

I have to side with Joe here.  Most of the "epoetry" I've seen is little
more than transferring printed text to html or whatever just as the first
and tv shows transferred radio, plays, and printed texts to the screen.

I think this leads to a text-based mindset for readers as well as writers.

While fascination with the new, the latest technology, the glitsy or
zingy-zangy, etc. seems overpowering right now, it will fade away quite
soon.  I think there is quality stuff already if one looks.

I think Joe was referring to new ways of writing (thinking) that are in
fact not possible on the printed page or at a reading.  Just because
one can't compose hyperlinked lines for the printed page or to be read
aloud does not mean they can't be poetry.  The same applies to simultaneous
multi-media composition: written and spoken, written and drawn,  spoken
and visual, moving and moving.

been expanded. I think some of the hostility to the net can be seen as an
adverse reaction to the decentralization the web offers. Sure, it's not
REAL decentralization. But it has ruined the academic authority over
poetry, as we have seen here. It has taken the "centers" of poetic
authority (the big city poetry clubs) and the graduate programs, and
tossed their authority out the window. Whatever authority those scenes,
schools, urban centers, still have is largely in reactionary retreat.
Rather than develop a community while participating, the reaction to the
"coming community" is a nostalgia for a community constructed by other
means:

1. anthologies, which re-code at least temporarily who's in and who's out,
are a good way of marking off the territory. Like the academy, which
doesn't recognize unjuried publications, the poetry scene can't handle
such a widespread invasion (without proper credentials, identifyable
formal tactics, having the last name of a famous poet, etc.).
Anthologies--are the productive residue of this social-formation process &
reconstruct whatever hierarchies are left after this dispersal of power
and authority.

2. arbitrary revaluation: I don't like looking at the screen (except tv)
so I can't read it, so it'll never get my vote as "serious literature";
there is no judgement giving authority to mediate issues of "quality
control" so the whole lot is a mess (i.e. it is too easy, too user
friendly, too accessible, too open); i make my books by hand, so they must
be better; I write by hand, so it must be more authentic, etc.


certainly many of the people who don't participate here or "officially"
"online" do so privately, gaining admittance to the cool private cc. lists
and the backchannel networking that makes everything go. so the idea that
there is some kind of split is just bullshit. also--since when did the
idea of "public access" become a worry to people who are now circling the
IBM selectric wagons hoping to ward off a total revolution. unfortunately
the "alternative" poetry community that doesn't adapt will be left to the
rare book rooms, which in my experince (in buffalo, ann arbor, east
lansing, portland, new york, and sandiego) are usually empty.

by the way, I hate being put in the position of being a defender of that
which don't need me to defend-and which i have no interest in defending.
But I can't even imagine the anti-digital backlash happening OFF this
list--and I find it odd that so many people busy perpetrating it here are
busy slamming it--

for my interest, the Small Press Collective and my branch of it, The
Student Periodical Club, are still in formation. for a link to all of that
see: http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~kuszai/

and for me it is all about "education" not as much about poetry. Luckily
for me, poetry can be a big part of the educational process, and not
because some kid needs to read Milton to know that he's among the slobs
sucking it up in the trashcompator of your favorite deathstar. And no, we
don't read Milton in Buffalo--there they assume that you read that stuff a
long time ago.

I want to second (or third) the wonderfulness of this book, which is really
fabulous even if far too small. Malmude, with just three books over a 25
year period, is one of the most underpublished and underappreciated poets of
my generation. Just when you've nearly forgotten about him, something like
this comes out and nearly takes the top of your head off.

I may have noted awhile back Merrill Gilfillan's Satin Street (from Asphodel
Press, though the rear cover says Moyer Bell) as a similar occasion, another
really fine poet whose work is far too hard to locate. [And has anyone
thought to publish his translations of Gaspard de la Nuit by Aloysius
Bertrand, the first book of prose poems (1826)?]

Books such as these are treasures.

Great point!  I'll end with this: what I love about poetry is its coming
to _total life_ before an audience: when the poet embraces _us_ with her
voice and physical presence.  Like, reading Lenin or hearing tapes of
Lenin in _no way_ compare to _being there_, to hearing and seeing and
smelling and feeling that big bald guy intoning -- and I mean really
in-toning -- in the square, to know the presence of state troops only five
blocks away, to know that ol Len is scared shitless but to hear him ride
that fear and bring us out of ours: I've heard poets do this (hopefully we
all have), and getting a voice-cut off the net from Buff's truly amazing
website just isn't the same.  I fear that we look toward the net the same
way we look, with each passing decade and its armamentarium of inventions,
toward gadget-x to save us from our increasing ennui.

So, responding to Jeff, in a sense the medium is the message and the

not only do they emerge from/create physical communities, they are
a PRODUCT that you can CIRCULATE by hand (gift-giving) in a way that

hmm, I like the image, Ron,  & the sense of the cage at Pisa as public place --
but first? maybe first public-jail-writing instance. I spent 2/3 of my 1.5
desultory years in Paris medical school so going around the city locating the
cafés writers wrote & were writing in -- hemingway's c.w-l.p, sartre &
beauvoir's  (&a hundred other's) flore, the surrealists hangouts from the 20s on.
When next in Paris, you'all should checkut the tables of the Closerie des Lilas,
corner of Boulvard Montparnasse & Boulevard St Michel: all the tables have little
brass plaques with the names of the writers used to use them -- for eating,
drinking and writing.

Thinking further back: how about calling "public writing" what Tzara did at the
Cabaret Voltaire performances in 1916/17: cutting the words up into the hat &
taking them out, making & reading a new work in public that way.  In a wonderful
detournement of such a situtaion is Jackson Mac Low's habit top write
continuously while attending other poet's readings, using , I believe in some
instances at least one of his procedures(the letters of the reading poet's name
in the postion they are in that name used to select words from the reading with
those letters in the same position)  to create new texts.

As to the web/vs stylus thread: any means whatever to get it down & spread it
around is good enough, pecil, typer, selectric, screen, bathroom wall, parchment,
Bic, Mont Blanc Fountain Pen, onion skin paper, etc. Genêt wrote several of his
novels in jail on toilet paper and had them smuggled out.  A writer's job is to
write, whatever the means at her disposal.

The "U" in utopia is "no" and makes the "A" in atopia a bit redundant.
"Noplace" and "Placeless" are both in the same distopian discourse commun=
ity, no?

No fingers pointed, but what we need to underline here, in thick black =
magic-marker,
is the difference between "collective action" (of which I'm sure there =
are a few good
examples on the net) and the rhetorics of "democracy", "utopia", and "com=
munity"
which have always only been ads for the emergent technology of the day. =
The
promotional language that surrounded radio in the 20s and 30s was almost =
word-for-
word the same as that used to promote our current stomping ground.  I hav=
e a
relevant piece in PMC January 1996, "Radio Lessons for the Internet"

<http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/pmc/popcult.all.html>

, or, for those of us denied access to Muse because we don't have account=
s at
universities that subscribe:

<http://rorty.ist.utl.pt/issue1/pmc.html>

As homey and seductive as it is, I don't find it particularly useful to =
talk about what
we are engaged with here in terms of rediscovering some lost connection. =
 In fact,
t's a much more sound to argue that espace proposes itself as the remedy =
for the
very social disjunction (commodity fetishism) which it creates.

Aside from being just plain wrong--computers, monitors, terminals, modems=
, phone
lines, "access providers" (love that phrase), tuition, computer ed, softw=
are, all do
COST-- this kind of discussion distracts us a bit from looking at the lit=
 being
produced.  We can recognize that the net is a decidedly class-b(i)ased =
phenomenon
that allows some people to *feel* like they're participating in a "commun=
ity" while
vacuuming *real* community and political action into itself (and excludin=
g wholesale
groups of others), AND talk about (and even ADMIRE) the kinds of "collect=
ive
action" that Joel rightly suggests it makes possible.  I think one of the=
 finest (and
funniest) of these projects happened on this very list a couple of years,=
 the Anti-
Hegemony Project.  There's a little write-up of it (if not the thing itse=
lf) at:

<http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/ezines/diu/diu26.5.html>

"Collaboration" was an early ad-line for the net, but I can count the num=
ber of good
examples of it on a few fingers.  Collaborative editing of e-zines and =
the mish-mash of
MOOs aside, I would love to hear about good online textual collaborations=
.  Some of
us must know where these things are... or maybe we just don't play well =
with others.

Missing my community,
Martin

So true, Spatehead, but are words and tongues and machines in isolation from
each other?  What guideth that consciousness toward the word, or draws said
word into form?  Poems exist not in themselves alone, but rely on the
mechanisms of their disemination, verily I believe.  The scratch of the pen
over paper, the tap of the typewriter or the clack of the keyboard don't
reverberate, in some way, through the organism of the poet/poem?  The field
of visions shift  from paper to screen, from grass or wood to light and glass.
Know ye I am not a Neuroscientologist, but the tools by which words are etched
transform, however subtly, a relationship with language.  Mind you, good sir,
these words I write are not etched in stone.  Tombstones are only reserved
for that dignity this day and age.  Language appeareth to me to possess a
weight and a lightness.  Thy medium relayeth the size and scope of vision.

What goes around comes around.  There was a similar (but much briefer)
discussion some time back on necessarily e-work (i.e., work that doesn't
translate to the page).  One link that can lead you to some of this stuff
is Jim Rosenberg's home page, http://www.well.com/user/jer/.  Unfortunately
he uses a hyperlink system that doesn't translate to html (do any of them?
I'm ignorant) but if you can get the right software his stuff is gorgeous.
Other folks might want to contribute other links.

Yes yes yes Tom -- and . . . "there is quality stuff already if one looks."

Lots of it in fact.

About a year ago, Chris Funkhouser said to me that it was possible -- just
barely -- for him to comprehensively survey the range of existing electronic
poetry in his dissertation. I don't think he (anyone) could do it today.

I'm trying to get (myself) out of the habit of qualifying (all) digital
poetics with an anticipatory hypothetical and the c(h)ant of the NEW -- we
have (some) digital poetics today, right now, that can already (uh oh) be
historicized, institutionalized, materialized. E-ven enjoyed. Matt

Dear George, Joel, Chris, and others,

It would be terrific to have some help. It's very difficult to do the whole
thing under single sail and I agree, development of the author pages are a
good way to go - and it is an area where there are immediate needs. This is
a space that was original envisioned as benefitting from collective energy.
Your suggestions are encouraging.

Perhaps a good way to proceed would be to e-mail me
(glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu) the name of the
author(s) you will do. I could perhaps make an "authors under development"
page on the EPC where this could be posted. Once you commit to an author I
would think the pages should be submitted to me within, say 2 months. The
authors you have mentioned in your posts on this topic are certainly ones
we'd like.=20

The template can be obtained at:
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/template

Some authors who need to be done in short order are mentioned in the
following post, originally sent out to graduate students in the Poetics
Program at UB. Note that this list is no more than a quick graph, that some
authors not listed have pages under construction, and that of course other
suggestions are welcome.

Thanks,
Loss

P.S. Please note that I may not be able to reply to your message for about
two weeks. I will reply as soon as I am able, however.

        We are asking people to consider contributing to the EPC author page
development initiative. We feel there are certain key authors who should
now have a page at the EPC. Since you may also be working on/reading some
of these authors, helping to create their page might be a simple matter,
and might be a natural tie-in to ongoing research.

        What is an author page? Our basic aim is to create a place where
links to resources in various web locations by and about the author might be
gathered. (Additionally, if the author would agree to notify me of future
web publications of their work, that would also be helpful.) In addition, in
an EPC author page, we often seek to make available some new-to-the-web
textual and/or visual resources, items specific to the EPC. But this is not
necessarily required.

        The basic requirements of such a page are a photo, a cv/list of
publications/ bibliography, brief bio, the above-mentioned textual work, and
the author's agreement to use their work. Files can be sent as attachments
to e-mail (include a list of file names in e-mail message) or mailed on
diskette.

        The main purpose here is to develop a center where people might find
out more about these authors. Help us with this collective effort to develop
this resources.

        A list of suggested authors whose pages need to be created or
developed follow. Have a look and let us know if you have thoughts.

For further details, please contact: Loss Glazier, glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu
or Charles Bernstein (bernstei@bway.net) regarding this initiative.

I absolutely agree with you that letters pressed into nice paper letterpress is
fabulous, that the materiality of language is fabulous, that everything from the
page space to the font to the binding or lack thereof is wonderful.  Sorry if I
ever implied that these things aren't.
I wouldn't even think such a thought.  And that last post, it was hasty and just

Pierre Joris just said:

"A writer's job is to write, whatever means are at their disposal"--

I love poetry and wish more people loved it as much as I do--

But I don't think that a writer's "job" is necessarily to write--

In the past two days the insinuation has been that good writer/writing has
something to do with how much writing is produced by said writer--

It seems to me that the notion of writing as work is a pretty
historical one--and, according to some (freshest on my mind is
Avital Ronell in CRACK WARS) would have come into the mix
with the Romantics (I believe, though I haven't looked this up for a
while--)

It also seems to me that a lot of people think
that peotry (in the generic sense) should be smeared all over everything--

Why the desire to make poetry ubiquitous (as opposed to available)? Poetry
isn't advertising--(the advertising of one's feelings? exhibitionist
poetics?)--

Why do some of us keep insisting that the world needs to be reading it
all the time? To be having it put in front of its face?

Maybe the "public" has reasons aside from false consciousness etc. for
not wanting to read poetry all the time--

So--

Some reactions to "publishing" in public places--

Best,
Katy

To help out in the effort to further knowledge of poets and poetry,
I will gladly accept any bios of poets not right for the EPC author
pages.  Send them to Comprepoetica!  Or directly to me.  Make sure to
give me a way of contacting bio-subjects, though, to clear the bios with
them.  I'd love to have bios of EPC authors, too--extensions of what the
EPC author pages have, though, not duplications of it.  I'm also
collecting poetics terms, with or without definitions, and discussions
of schools of poetry, etc.

Nicole Brossard's name came up in the list of poets for whom there
have not yet been a magazine issues or critical studies.  Hot off the
press from Peter Lang is a book by my friend Alice A. Parker,
 _Liminal Visions of Nicole Brossard_.  It's hard cover -- $53.95 --
 so ask a library to buy it?
 (ISBN 0-8204-3065-X.  e-mail: customerservice@plang.com)

Alice worked with Nicole for several years in preparing this
excellent book.

Contents:

Pretext: The Enigma of Writing (Quantum Reading)
In the Beginning is Desire
A Differential Equation of Lesbian Love
Holographic Writing: The Generic Woman
Reading Nicole Brossard Reading Djuna Barnes: Intertextuality and
  Subjectivity
Open Work: The Mauve Horizon
From Post-Modern to Polytechnique: Figuring the Violence
Rituals of Reading / Rituals of Writing
Body Work: The Speed of Silence
When Language Lapses


I think that Small Press Distribution still has a number of
Brossard's works in print.

tho i'm mostly with joe amato on this thread, to me the technology is
(still) alltoo new for one to be able to come down firmly for or against.

while the analogy to print culture is certainly not a seamless one,
it's still a useful one.  being for or against web/electronic print
seems to me akin to being for or against moveable type circa 1505.  look
how long it took print to impact poetry, and even the continued changes it
wrought upon poetry even until recently.  take wyatt as someone who, save
tottel's miscelleny, was for all intents and purposes a manuscript poet --
same for donne, save his 1633 edition.  perhaps not until the mid-19th
century do we get print as a serious means of commodifying writing for a
mass print readership -- the serialization of dickens' novels.  then along
comes the typewriter in, what, the 1930, whence wcw, cummings.

what's new is /not/ michael joyce's afternoon, a text i find entirely
uninteresting: once you "get" the trick afforded by the technology,
there's little point in going on.  nevertheless joyce's text will maintain
it's position in the hypertext literature canon (and i don't lament this)
mostly by virtue of its timing and its novelty.  likewise, bolter's
writing space, while a good book and especially a good one for when it
came out (1991?), is by now hopelessly out of date.  for what's /really/
new, go to the ubuweb, burningpress, and light&dust sites...

Many of the authors I have so far solicited for a l y r i c m a i l e r
have asked: does this count as publication? Yes. It should. My
answer thus far has been that the existence of the large, interested
readership on this list and others and the (yes, problematic) easy,
quick-read nature of web-published, text-based poetry might actually
secure  a larger audience for the poetry than would a print-magazine, the
majority of whose subscribers would probably be university libraries.

Print-culture prestige depends upon the quality of your binding
and the corporate or non-profit icon there appearing.

Poetas,

of poss. anecdotal interest, today's L.A. Times carries a front-page
article on the American poet du jour (thanks to l'affaire d'Lewinsky) --

http://www.latimes.com/HOME/NEWS/FRONT/t000020758.1.html

The online version is divided into 9 screens-ful; am pasting in the
intitial 2 below.  What follows includes mention of an upcoming opera
abt. Whtiman (by Robert Strassburg, set to open this fall at Cal
State L.A.), the big Rutgers U. Whitman conference happening this
fall, and other things.  Luminaries such as Gary Snyder, Ed Folsom
and J.D. McClatchy are quoted (or, w/ Robert Hass, paraphrased)
in brief; etc.  Not a bad report, all in all . . .

cheers, d.i.

            COLUMN ONE
            Whitman Goes Global
              The poet's themes, once thought distinctly American, fire
            imaginations from here to Nepal. Rumor linking his work to
            the Clinton-Lewinsky story has scholars, reporters trying
            to read between the lines.
            By TONY PERRY, Times Staff Writer =A0

                       These are boom times for Walt
                 Whitman, America's most influential poet.
                  =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0A century after his death, Whitman, the
                  poet of democracy, the poet of the body and
                  soul, commands a loyal and expansive following from
                  his birthplace on Long Island to the literary
                  circles of Nepal.
                   =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0His rough, rigorous, unrhymed
                  verse, informal and impassioned, appeals to both
                  genders, all ages and numerous nationalities.
                  =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0"Whitman is the poet of liberty, of indiv=
idual
                  freedom," said Carol Muske-Dukes, a poet and
                  creative writing professor at USC. "As the world
                  heads toward a new millennium, Whitman speaks more
                  loudly and directly to people than ever."
                  =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Whitman may even have a fan in the White =
House.
                  If the daily leakage is to be believed, his
                  masterpiece, "Leaves of Grass," has a cameo in the
                  investigation involving President Clinton and former
                  White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
                  =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Whitman's poetic themes--themes that Amer=
icans
                  in their ethnocentric way thought were uniquely
                  American--turn out to be so energetically universal
                  that they are increasingly being assimilated into
                  different cultures.
                 =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0In China, a new Mandarin
                  translation of his entire 400-poem canon has become
                  a bestseller. The Communist government tried to
                  suppress its publication in recent years but
                  abandoned that effort in the face of widespread
                  opposition.
                  =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Whitman has long been popular in
                  China--although his works were banned as
                  subversive by Mao Tse-tung during the
                  Cultural Revolution. In an earlier decade, the
                  revolutionary followers of Sun Yat-sen were devoted
                  Whitman readers. ("My call is the call of battle/I
                  nourish active rebellion," Whitman said in "Song of
                  the Open Road.")
                 =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0In August, Polish National Radio
                  broadcast a marathon Whitman reading. A year
                  earlier, 23 Hungarian translators finished
                  translating 73 Whitman poems. A professor at the
                  University of Wales completed a translation of
                  Whitman into Welsh.
                 =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0A Brazilian scholar has surveyed
                  Whitman's influence on Brazilian writers,
                  and a scholar at a university in Katmandu, Nepal,
                  just finished "Whitman's System of Dynamic
                  Meditation: A Tantric Guide to His Work."
                =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0The domestic and international spread of Wh=
itmania
                  --the term used by his fans to describe their
                  devotion--has been spurred by new editions, new
                  critical studies, new translations, ever larger
                  symposiums and an increasing number of reading
                  circles.
                =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0One of the most active is at Leisure World
                  in Laguna Hills. It is run by Robert
                  Strassburg, an emeritus professor of music at Cal
                  State L.A. Each month for seven years, 50 or so
                  fellow retirees gather to parse Whitmanian lines and
                  debate their meaning.
               =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0"By the 21st century, Whitman will be as wel=
l-
                  known around the world as  Shakespeare or Beethoven,"
                 Strassburg predicted after last month's meeting. ...

provocative response and some truth in the notion that print mags emerged
and continue to out of physical communities, tho i'd imagine that several
press ventures over the years have involved people working from different
physical or geographic sites (different cities, states, countries) and that
the contributing and editing 'community' emerged out of the networking of
individuals who perhaps never met face-to-face / i know i've heard stories
of such ventures and perhaps others here could fill us in / the problem is
also how one defines "community", since in addition to "people living in a
specific locality" it can also mean a body of people with some practice or
profession in common, or a "fellowship of interests" / and this i guess is
where we disagree, since in the latter two senses of the word, electronic
zines certainly can emerge out of or establish a community, no quotes /
also i should clarify that i suggested the term "metazine" (off the cuff
really) as one possible response to another listee's (Tom Becket's i
believe) statement or query about potential "collective actions" on the web
(not as a synonym for e-zines) / i don't see electronic collectives (ie,
separate journals and magazines joining and cross-publishing their efforts
through electronic hyperlinks) as a means of replacing or simulating
physical communities, but again simply as one of the ways web ventures can
be collective and, yes, communal in their actions / the appeal to me would
be in the way a venture of this sort would suggest "a fellowship of
interests" or commitment to common practice, and how it would
localize/concentrate people's activities in the only way possible in
electronic space / as for "neo-platonic" and "christian humanistic
prudery", i'm afraid i just don't get it -- i see people with common
interests getting together to explore possibilities in a fresh medium, as
the NE locals did with their first magazines, no?

best,
bill

have just received a rejection slip from a smalltime college literary

To belabor:

topos being "place"

u- being "no" thus "no place" i.e. does not exist
but translated Utopia meaning "place of ideal perfection" whereas

dys- being "ill" or "bad" thus
dystopia meaning the opposite of translated utopia, "bad or ill place"
whereas

a- (or an-) being "not", "without", or "lacking" thus
atopia meaning without lacking place but implying the existence of
something though not of the "landed" type, say being

I forward this definition, uncontentiously, as being distinct from utopia
as it implies not an ironic criticism of human ideals of perfection nor
perfection itself nor perdition, so to speak, but a state of being whose
location or place is not verifiable in physical terms. Thus the utterance
is not "located" in space but rather in the "moment" of it's articualtion
in Time.  Placelessness allows for dismbodied, placeless communication
across great distance, in time. Place requires physical presence, which
isn't always possible. No place requires the impossible, perfection. Bad
places we all want to stay out of. Atopia allows us not community, but
communication (between beings in distant places in time) that otherwise we
could or would not have made.

Atopia is municipal

admittedly this is one of the things i find myself missing too, in email
communications like these for example, when, among other things, it's hard
to posit ideas with a light or humorous touch (although David Bromige does
it pretty damn well!) or to convey emotion (:)) without recourse to
reductive and often misleading (?) emoticons (;)) etc. / it becomes an
issue of rhetoric as with other writing -- i *miss* the same things when i
read a letter from a friend or a rejection slip from a journal / so i'm
afraid the tired point has to be made that if you subsitute the word "book"
or "newspaper" or "personal letter" for "web" in your statement above, the
language of your critique sounds suddenly antiquated and reactionary -- if
no "true communication" can take place without "viceral stimulation between
the people communicating", then this pretty much damns the whole written
record, doesn't it?, and not just the web, unless you mean something more
specific by "communication" / not to sound flip, but we're communicating
here, aren't we?

sure, a vast cacophony, but wander around the triple-decker Border's in
Chicago and you hear the same voices crying (really, bookstores often fill
me with anxiety -- so much to read, etc. -- the web is no different) / and
i think it might help to think of the bubble-jet printer as a forerunner to
the pixelated screen -- bits and bytes or ink dots, take your pick / one
just smears a little easier

i'd like to write more, but i'm off to meet Joel Kuszai who's visiting San
Diego and whom i met in this space / we're gonna get together over coffee
and talk about how the Internet destroys human social interaction

I've been thinking about a new, more interesting
way to operate n/formation (my ezine =96 see .sig
below for my URL), so while we're all debating
the print versus e-publication teeny zine thing,
I just thought I'd put in that one thing a zine can
do on the www but not in print is... add to itself.
I'm thinking here of p e r f o r a t i o n s specifically,
which organizes itself nodally around topics, such
that there begins with an initial cluster and +s to
it, over time developing something much larger
and more dialogical. on the other hand, I might
as easily cite other sites more local =96 non seems
to me something like this, as we're given it in
development; dunno, tho, if this sort of continued
developing is in the plan (hey, Laura?).

anyway, I know whatcha sayin': well, but folks
can respond to one another in print journals, it
happens all the time be civilized, man. [Poet, be
like =96 totally, dude =96 get a clew, would you?]. alls
I'm saying is that here in atopia or whereever,
dis here topia (dys-topia?), we're afforded (ha)
an opportunity for a different organ-ization, i.e.,
a different embodiment of that work, and one
which might encourage yammering to the extent
that a) everyone's talking in the same room 'bout
similar things; b) I promettre that response time
wld be optimum =96 i.e., that I'd get yr responses
to the matter at hand up in a jiffy.

I'm wondering, what is it that folks think abt.
such a fiendish plan? willing to write for it &
not just search yr files for work that sorta fits?
willing to send prose? =96 which, again, is I think
the hardest goddamn'd thing to get round here.

now, IDEALLY this involves a print version
of the original cluster with a whole big page abt.
the www version and making responses or
something =96 but in the real world, I lack the
inner resources to keep making a piece of paper
with words on them in more than a few copies,
at least until I can figger something out. and no,
like everyone else I don't have any funding or
rich Uncle Sugardaddy (mommy?) Sammy.

incidentally, in mentioning this re-organization,
I don't mean to impugn any of the work I have
there =96 got some damn'd fine pieces by a # of
us present here, and other damn'd fine pieces
by others not present. mmhmmm.

so, next iss. is topical an I'll announce it here,
live, say you saw it here first.

best, Chris

well, so much to say to all who've been posting such insightful stuff...

Q:  Is it a sad or happy fact of life that you met your partner (Kass,
above) online?
A:  Both.

the web is, as martin s. suggests, symptomatic of certain national (and
restrictively global) trends---techno-corporate-capitalist, if you like...
in this sense it figures a technology that is and is not (tom beckett) a
tool, if by tool you mean something like a screwdriver... we are caught if
you like at the junction of the corporate (which in the case of the web
only seems, as so many have now commented on, to displace the corporeal)
and a decentralized, distributed agency... which is to say, that some
writers see the web, as many see technology itself, as NOT simply a tool...
hence the art|technology divide that still persists in certain circles
(until, that is, as is now happening and as joel and others indicate, web
publication becomes 'suitable,' 'official' criteria for awards, honors,
vitae etc)... or, in order to neutralize, imaginatively, the evident
saturation of these spaces with fortune 500 motives, some writers call the
web-computer-modem combine simply a tool and proceed thenceforth, agencies
intact and unintervened-in...

i posted the codrescu excerpt by virtue of the former attitude---web as
instrument of oppression (and note c's refusal to understand npr
broadcasting as a digital technology fully in complicity, if that's the
word, with his "imaginary electronic globe," lansat hook-ups and all)... by
virtue of the tool ideology we might have a look at the discourse coming
out of post-mcluhanites (yes, i read mcluhan too)... an unsettling amalgam
of these two perspectives occurs in a tiny book by jacques attali,
_millennium:  winners and losers in the coming world order_ (random house,
1991)...

i'm asking that we manage not to lose sight of the transnational corporate
empire even as we plumb away on our plastic devices (i.e., tools)...

matt, you're right about the "new," of course --- in context --- as is tom
bell re jay bolter's book... but here again it *is* a matter of context:  i
hardly expect to have to justify emedia publication on an electronic list
named "poetics"!... i *do* expect to have to interrogate its
implications---for poetic form, collective action, network community (not
an oxymoron, according to howard rheingold, albeit not imho a substitute
for the 'real thing,' gabriel g, but then---shall we thereby forgo same?),
etc... at the same time, this list itself emerges out of a public poetic
context which, a mere six summers ago, was in many ways unwilling to accept
that the internet was here to stay (each of you can 'fess up now,
privately, as to what you each believed five years back re email etc.)...

now, in certain circles in which i move, i wouldn't mention jay bolter's
book as a starting point (b/c in fact it is dated---albeit i still like his
thumbnail history), and i would advocate that the 'new' (whatever it is)
would have to be understood as itself time-dependent, itself subject to
newer (historical?) developments... which is to say, that in the digital
world three years old is ancient... but of course, in the geological world,
this is hardly the case... so i use the 'new' hereabouts as a colloquial
gesture, yes, but also to tip my hat toward the idea of the new as itself
rendered anew... (case in point:  i generally check my email before i send
out a long-ish post such as this one... reason being something new might
have been said in the half-hour or so interim it takes me to compose this,
something that negates my feeling the need to say it mself)...

of course, as tom bell indicates, the web is nothing new!---in some
sense... in that the printing press as an "agent of change" (e. eisenstein)
itself could be thought to emerge from sociocultural coordinates too...
many if not most of us have long-since lost the sense of this latter device
and its offspring (and its associated distribution networks) in such
terms... which is what i'm saying when i ask folks, pedantically perhaps,
to think through the assumptions they bring to online spaces from the print
world, and---hey, here's the point now---*vice versa*... chopping up trees
is not a good thing in itself, nor is the refuse coming out of the plastics
industry... in my view, neither can be entirely avoided (not now,
anyway)... and we should, as poets, and to be as emphatic about it as i
can, get our feet wet in all spheres (a tautological prompt in part, owing
to the fact that you're all, skeptical or otherwise, reading this
online---again, part of my point here)...

charles b raises a similar issue in his ebr6 piece (which you'll need
netscape 3.x or equiv. to view/read!---access again!):  (as i recall) that
rejections of innovative poetry (please allow me this phrase for just a
moment) parallel, rhetorically, rejections of electronic form... that in
effect, a similar conservatism underwrites both impulses... of course, this
does not foreclose on the possibility that one may like innovative poetry
and hate electronic form; or that one may like electronic form and hate
innovative poetry... mself, i would fret both of these latter positions...

as dale suggests, spending time online *will* affect our reading and
writing habits, in ways that are, i think, only beginning to be
documented... matt---i sit on the editorial board of _computers and
composition_, have for some years now---and i still regularly run across
studies of writing, in print and online, that time and again utilize tacit
assumptions from (if you will) a strictly print-literate pov (no sense that
the writer has read contemporary poetry, or understands developments in
radio during this century, etc.)... the ten-year track record to which you
refer is in fact even longer, if you include online communications (as you
know, i'm sure)... those of you who are interested, have a look at shoshana
zuboff's _in the age of the smart machine_, in which zuboff analyzes an
online business scenario from the early 80s... and for that matter, the
hawisher leblanc moran selfe history of computers and composition (on
ablex) begins in 1979... and for that matter, ted nelson used the term
hypertext in the mid-60s, and published the first version of _literary
machines_  in 1980... again, a fascinating dialogue on same (with mark
amerika, robert coover, and janet murray talking about nelson's book) in
the current issue of FEED (you'll need that newer netscape or equiv.
again!) at

http://www.feedmag.com/html/document/98.02nelson/98.02nelson_master.html?mail

(odd-looking url, but it works)

as to whether poetry really needs to be read by all or some or (katy):
well it's never read by all, is it?... personally, i'll seek the
satisfaction of a readership that's interested, small or large, and hope,
optimist that i am, that i can make a valuable contribution, somehow... if
the web fuels a whitmanian impulse that everyone is speaking, or must
speak, to everyone, that's an issue worth pursuing in these spaces too...
in any case i agree in general with the suggestion that a new sort of
literacy, or set of literacies, is emerging---hence perhaps even a new
sense of what we mean by "literacy"---and that this  *might* topple prior
hierarchies... but not w/o collective effort of some sort, which i suppose
need not comprise, always, a purely conscious (political) effort... though
i do indeed fear (if that's the word) the coming of a new set of mediated
hierarchies, too, much more powerful than those of the past, if much more
implicit... virtual, if you like... a development that in my view is likely
to parallel what some on this continent are now calling the booming "office
economy"...

i'm enjoying this exchange, really, and learning much from all of you...

best,

joe

amongst all us jaded terminal heads, has anyone mentioned the sheer joy
of having your work accessible to people all over the globe?  I know,
not accessible to everybody yet.

so I find my own attitude is a bit lopsided - asymmetrical.  I have
trouble READING poetry on the web; but I like having my own junk
available to OTHERS!!  (this asymmetry, come to think of it, maybe
seeps into ALL poetry for me... oh-oh...)

that's honesty for you.  I always remember what Wallace Stevens said
(though I can't remember the exact quote) - something about: "where would
I be if I spent a lot of time paying attention to my contemporaries?"

denounce that attitude if you will, but there's something to it.
All the top poets have been blind; a lot were deaf & pretty dumb, too.
It's like piano tuning - helps sharpen the mumbling.  Like fasting the
appetite.  I find I play better music if I HAVEN'T practiced for a long
time.  This doesn't hold for all creative situations - just want everybody
to be clear on that.  [joke]  Down with community - drop like a stone,
just so long's you anchor right.

In response to the general buzz about cyberspace versus print media etc, I
come down on the side of poetry, wherever and however it occurs genuinely and
offers something of food value to both reader and writer. That technical
innovation will have some effect on the presentation and content of poetry and
the lives of poets seems a given, and nothing much to worry about. Rather it
offers one more interesting sidelight in the evolution of an art that will
continue as long as there are people interested in pursuing it. The difficulty
I encounter as I follow this thread, is that the
gist of these posts imply "career" (a word that is probably antithetical to
any honest poetic moment, & the very thing the language poets decry in the
mainstream/mfa elite) is at the back/middle or front of many people's minds.
Of course I may be mistaken, and I do not claim that such things do not enter
my own mind, they do. However, I have been writing for twenty five years,
sometimes in considerable poverty, partly because another life did not seem to
be forthcoming, but also because I willingly resisted it, sometimes out of
stubborness, sometimes out of fear, and sometimes because I sensed that it
would be harder to write/read/and think with that particular monkey on my
back.  From such a perspective I have no one to blame or to resist, and the
only people I have to thank are a few friends in the art. This is not to say I
haven't railed at the way things are in moments of need, and I suppose if fate
delivered me into the hands of a career at this point in my life I would
probably take it because I need the money. But I am not likely to pursue my
writing or its publication as a means to that end right now, mainly because my
work is where I prefer to put my energy, but also because I am aware that it
is risky to entertwine personal ambition and poetics.  Frankly it worries me
that so many on this list appear to be in the other camp without at least
questioning the potentially dangerous position so much self-promotion ( or
promotion of one "kind" of poetry against another) can put them in .  David

My wife and I argue all the time about how and why (and when) to read
poetry.  She almost never does (maybe once or twice a year).  Her reasons:

        1. it takes too much work to read poetry (even the 'easy' ones)
        2. she can't lose her 'self' like she can with novels
        3. to her, writing should have 'story'

but, because she very rarely reads poetry, does it mean isn't a force in
her life?

She is constantly trying to get me to read novels, but I won't.  I don't
like them.  My reasons:

        1. it takes too much work to read novels (even the 'easy' ones)
        2. i feel uncomfortable losing my 'self' in a novel
        3. to me, writing should have 'experience'

I like it that when I read poetry, I'm aware that I'm a person reading
poetry, as well as experiencing the act of reading and whatever 'effects'
the poem has on me (or i upon the poem).

So, are we just two types of people who experience writing/life in
different ways?  Or is one of us right?

Does such a thing exist?

Not, of course, of individual events -- such as Jack Collom's reading with
Dug Rothschild tomorrow night at St. Marks, or Tom Raworth's reading with
Drew Gardner Thursday at Poetry City -- but the places, times, hosts?

I told a friend of mine I'd find out if there were any reading series in

Would it be a useful document or would it provoke headaches?

yinz might wanna join the Utopias list at UB. same address as this. this
debate has been rocking the utopianist scholars world since i joined that
list...for more entertaining discussion of this topic, hook up with the
reesarch on anarchism list curtsy of nothinness.org. much of it is in

New media. Old media. Books superior. Web a class issue. Okay, fine. What
I'd like to see happen is a CD-ROM anthology of American Sign Language
poetry--which is out there, and must, by its nature, have a unique poetic,
but doesn't get, for lack of a better word, "heard" through the usual
channels. Maybe a CD ASL po-zine from Gallaudet?

Then, to make it really interesting, they could play the video clips of
poems to ASL-literate apes and get their response. ("You call this poetry?
If I had the time, I could write /Hamlet/....")

Actually, my diffidence about electronic publication is pretty simple: if
it precludes publication of the same piece in a print publication, or if
the electronic submission must be previously unpublished, I'm not
interested. Otherwise, why not?
I guess that means I still see the web as more ephemeral than print, and
that I prefer a smaller audience, if necessary, that's likely to stay with
the poem longer.

I was sorry to hear of the death of Jack Micheline.  Jack was a gracious
and wild energy in the North Beach poetry scene when I lived there in the
late 80's.  He was everywhere, selling the socialist newspaper in each cafe
and adding poetry to the climate with his intelligence and heart.  Have a
good one, Jack.

I've been asked to give a talk this summer to help poets try to understand
what publishers are looking for, etc.  I'm planning to push it a little bit
and, where appropriate, talk from the opposite view point: how publishers
(primarily those of periodicals such as journals) can do a better job of
communicating to potential submitters.  I would love any suggestions any of
you might have on points, nits & grand schemes to make sure I hit.

thanks,
Tim

weird, mark w, how much we differ here:  i didn't even put up a website for
mself until i had what i thought were sufficient epublications, and
certainly didn't and don't want those to overlap with my work in print...
didn't put my vita online---didn't see the point... didn't put my print
work online either (not saying you shouldn't)... didn't even compose a
hypertext till i could come up with something that violated generic
differences (whatever its value, it does this)... my website is useful, to
me, b/c i use it as a node to 'gather' my online work... in general, i want
to publish stuff online intended to be viewed/read (slippage intended)
online... i imagine my print pubs overlapping with my electronic
pubs---sometimes intended and sometimes not... but not in terms of
dupes---i'm talking thematically---lines, concerns, images, etc... i
imagine my "self" in this sense as occupying alternating alphabetic, visual
and aural habitats...

any writer imagining herself so is bound to require, in the near future, a
critical apparatus that can take account of these alternating,
con/disjunctive effects... one nice thing about this medium is that it's
helped throw the formal issues in relief...

which is to say that, personally, i would recommend---as a different sense
of how to go about this---publishing stuff online that in fact you have no
intention of publishing elsewhere... if you're even a little creative with
online possibilities, any print reprint MUST be a substantively different
reading (maybe even writing) experience... which is to say, make it for the
screen and it changes, often in subtle ways... why not explore/construct
along this axis, just for a change?... what have you got to lose?... the
risk is, as always, in the making...

of course there are all SORTSA publishing-business issues that arise when
you attempt to publish something in a trade or academic press that was
previously published online (and vice versa---as i just discussed
backchannel with someone)... one of the interesting issues is whether
simply putting something online yourself IS publishing... well of course it
is... and if someone links to you---is this publication too?... and when
does this activity begin to accrue (in the eyes of whomever) intellectual
capital? (which self-publishing today seems not to)... certainly when it
generates $$$, but not only then, no?...

best,

joe

Interesting topic. When you find an answer patent it. Tje Junction Press
entry in the Dustbooks directory says "Modernist/postmodernist poetry,
non-academic," but I get mostly submissions that by anybody's definition
fall outside the parameters. Years ago I did a magazine called Broadway
Boogie. The name itself should have been a giveaway, as the contents surely
were, which didn't stop someone from sending me an incredibly mannered 75
page manuscript in heroic couplets.
When I get a real mismatch I often scribble on the return "you could have
saved the postage if you'd looked at one of our books," but desperation (I
guess) and self-deception are powerful drugs. By the evidence of the
cover-letters almost none of my suitors have taken the trouble to find out
what I publish. Which, by the way, isn't very flattering.
Maybe someone's done a study that tells these people that making a blind
submission to all the publishers in the directory is cost-effective.

Joe--I'm not sure that we have polar positions here. That part of your work
that you intend for the kind of reading that the web facilitates requires a
much surer sense of the medium than I have at present. This may change over
time.
The "property" issues are real, and aren't for me about money. If I publish
a poem on the web that's really ben written with paper in mind do I
preclude the possibility of subsequent journal publication? And do e-zines
as a rule require that the work they publish never have seen the public
light before?

I recently asked you all why some poets like Ted Berrigan are ignored by the
"academy"  and no-one was interested enough to reply about how they see
Berrigan's work, well I guess you all are too busy talking about the WWW!,
I suppose the academy of the future is closing its doors to argue about
publishing on the web? If anyone wants a break, write to me and explain why
some critics call Berrigan an "ardent disciple" and like some kid brother to
Frank O' Hara. An imitator. His writings mean alot to me, and I would like
some discussion on the matter.

anyhow, back to the web.


it was good to meet up with Bill Marsh of poeticslist fame and it proves
that there is some humanity to all this. he showed me a nice little cafe
where everyone was reading and not talking! imagine! well we lit that
place up pretty good--especially when we got to remembering the good old
days on poetics. and Mark Weiss your next, Rae? you there? Don? You had
all better be at the reading tomorrow. I'm goign to take some time out of
staring at endless asymmetries and soon--my fav., the Light Poems---hmmm.

on another affront, I'm not sure what Katy means about making poetry
ubiquitous. haven't you ever seen, wuzzit called "streetfare journal"? do
they still have that? I'll never forget riding around on the busses of san
francisco and seeing creeley poem and nikki giovanni and more. right where
the ads are! imagine!  and advertising is the poets trade. didn't lew
welch write "raid kills bugs dead" ? i've taught that little humdinger of
a poem, and it always gets tremendous applause from the students. another
one, not so tremendous, is the poem by Reznikoff, goes (from memory)
something like:

FOR AN INSCRIPTION OVER A SUBWAY ENTRANCE

This is the gift of Hephestus
the god men say is lame.


I'm not sure if I have that right, but it (for me is a little better than
the one about the "girder still itself among the rubble"

break a leg tomorrow, if thats when you read, Joel. The box of books from
Meow arrived, what a breathtaking collection and congratulations, again, on
your endeavor! We should be talking about Berrigan (Ted) but we should also
be talking about these Meow Press books. I will (must go eat right now,

I don't know who the academy is, but I do think Berrigan's work is really
really good.  What you didn't hear, was a lurker smiling.  And yes his
complete work should be in print.

if you would like to know why Ted Berrigan is sometimes referred to as an
"ardent disciple" of Frank O'Hara, I suggest you look at the interview
with Berrigan ("On Frank O'Hara's Birthday") which is included in the
O'Hara memorial volume edited by Berkson and LeSeur.

Re Berrigan in general, there are more memoirs than criticism, but the
Waldman edited NICE TO SEE YOU memorial book has a good share of both.
The Tom Clark ("Late Returns") and Ron Padgett ("Ted") memoir volumes, if
you don't have them, are worth reading.  Aram Saroyan wrote a novel ("The
Street") before Ted died, and a memoir "Friends in the World," both of
which deal with Berrigan as person and poet.  There is also random stuff
by Andrei Codrescu discussing the intrinsic importance of Berrigan.

A couple years ago someone on this list indicated they were writing a
Ph.D thesis on the works of Berrigan -- maybe that project has advanced.

Kuszai, sorry if you were not meaning to be serious, I feel this web
publishing topic has been beat down hard and that you were trying to make
light of my post to generate some serious talk on Ted Berrigan by saying "back
to the web."
So lets talk about Berrigan , Padgett, Ashbery, any of the "New York School"
poets, where do they fit in say the (olson /pound /williams) tradition of
poetry, more specifically does anyone see "The Sonnets" as collage?
enough publishing talk , just do it!
By any means necessary!!!

Annie,

It is, I believe, Jack Hirshman who was (and hopefully still is) out hawking
CP newspapers at events in SF. Micheline was a friend of his, but a fairly
different guy. The best obit I saw was in the SF Examiner (compared with an
unforgivably stupid piece in the Chron). Since it includes Jack M's last
poem, I paste in below:

Jack Micheline, poet, painter, free spirit

Eric Brazil OF THE EXAMINER STAFF
March 1, 1998

Author of 20-plus books was Beat icon to fellow poets

Jack Micheline, an underground hero among his fellow poets who lived the Bohemia
n life to the hilt, died Friday
on a BART train somewhere between his San Francisco home and Orinda.

Mr. Micheline was 68. His death was attributed to a heart attack. He had been a
diabetic for several years. His
body was found by BART police when the train reached the Orinda station.

Born Harvey Martin Silver in New York, Mr. Micheline changed his name as a young
 man and committed himself
to the artist's life, living by his pen and paintbrush, always poor, always on t
he move.

During his lifetime, Mr. Micheline authored more than 20 books, most recently la
st year, when FMSBW Press of
San Francisco brought out "Sixty Seven Poems for Downtrodden Saints."

"We considered him a very pure person," said author Gerald Nicosia of Corte Made
ra. "In the literary business,
most people are in it for fame or money, but he was doing it because he loved wh
at he was doing, and he had a
great gift. There was real music to his poems."

Mr. Micheline had lived in San Francisco, in the South of Market and Mission dis
tricts, since the mid-1970s. And
although he disavowed the label of Beat poet, he was nevertheless a Beat icon -
a street poet whose poems were
meant to be spoken and a champion of society's underdogs. Jack Kerouac, author o
f "On the Road" and arguably
the most famous of the Beats, wrote the introduction to Mr. Micheline's first bo
ok, "River of Red Wine."

"His sweet lines revive the poetry of open hope in America," Kerouac wrote.

San Francisco poet Neeli Cherkovski, who knew Mr. Micheline for almost 40 years,
 said Saturday, "He always
lived out the romanticism of the poet of the streets, the downtrodden. He never
made it to a big publisher - he
always shied away."

Nevertheless, he said, "thousands of young poets in the country kind of march to
 the rhythms of Jack Micheline.
He was always, like, under the underground, and the establishment held him at ar
m's length."

The late writer Charles Bukowski, a soul mate, had said Mr. Micheline's poems "a
re total feelings beating their
heads on barroom floors. I can't think of anyone who has more and who has been n
eglected more. Jack is the last
of the holy preachers, sailing down Broadway singing the song."

Although he had tethered himself to San Francisco, Mr. Micheline's restlessness
never left him, and he stayed on
the move.

"Always quick to pack his bags and take a trip, then roll into town and sleep on
 my couch until he could get his
hotel room back," is the way his publisher, San Francisco Deputy Public Defender
 Matt Gonzalez, described him.

"He had a lot of different sides. He was very spiritual, and he also had the Bea
t sensibility and a great big heart,"
Gonzalez said. "He had an immense number of friends."

Mr. Micheline could also be a pain in the neck to work with - even denying autho
rship of a poem until shown the
manuscript in his handwriting, Gonzalez said. A second printing of his last book
 is almost ready for publication.

Nicosia said that Mr. Micheline "could be very difficult, but there was a small
coterie of people who knew him well,
and you kind of got past that thorny exterior, the loner with the blustery Bronx
 mannerism. And if you got past
that, there was a real sweetheart in Jack. He was always there for the poor, the
 homeless, the people left by the
wayside in society."

There was "real music to his poems," Nicosia said. "They sing and they bounce an
d they jump around the page."

For example:

OUT OF THE RAINS

Out of the rains

And mud of cities

Walking in a fog

On subway platforms

In Harlem and Brooklyn and Queens

I see the faces of children

Staring at me

And I want to run from the city

Past freights

And ships

And buildings that scrape the sky

I want to race down streets

Dreaming of mountains and Spanish girls

I am a poet

I stare at the ground to see if I am bleeding.

Long after becoming a published poet, Mr. Micheline took up painting - an art at
 which he made more money than
at his chosen vocation.

Charles Wehrenberg of San Francisco, a dealer in rare art objects who owns 40 or
 50 Micheline paintings, said that
"he was a really phenomenal painter, but he was so involved with the whole idea
that the dead rule the world he
didn't think he'd succeed until he dropped dead."

Mr. Micheline's technique was "totally primitive" and eschewed draftsmanship. We
hrenberg said that he once
asked Mr. Micheline for a series of portraits on famous people he knew, and Mr.
Micheline retorted that "I ain't no
f- - - camera."

"His whole idea was to paint people's psyches," Wehrenberg said.

"He was a very hard-to-like character, but he had very brilliant moments. He was
 absolutely adamant that he didn't
want to succeed. He wouldn't mind winning a lot of money, but he'd immediately l
ose it back on the horse races,"
Wehrenberg said. "He really is the character that Kerouac wrote about in "On the
 Road.' He is Whitman's wild
child. He really did live out a poetic life."

Right, said his poet friend Cherkovski. "He was kind of wild. Even in his 60s he
 was still a man of the streets. He
was saying, "I'm outside the system, I don't belong to it.' "

Mr. Micheline is survived by his son, Vincent Silver of Tucson, Ariz. Funeral se
rvices are pending.

This is Mr. Micheline's last poem, written Feb. 25, 1998, in San Francisco.

POEM

To capture the feeling

To feel its pulse

To see the stream has been muddied

I am reshaping the start

I cannot be bothered with your

Earthly pleasures

All these rantings and ravings

Have nothing to do with poetry

Have nothing to do with magic

Only the ears of butterflies

And birds

And the delicate moths

Matter.

Let the Angels in

Let them into this Market

Now

Feel, see and breathe.

I like DB's idea of discussing Meow Press books.  Especially since I've only
seen one of them (Silliman's XING).  Actually, I thought I'd worked out a swap
for a couple of them but I may not be remembering correctly.  In any event, it
would be nice to switch gears and talk about some specific books.  Why is it
when I see WWW I immediately think of Hulk Hogan.
As ever,

To labor:

I don't know what "irony" is in Greek, but in Latin it's "illusio".
As in:  My distinction between utopia and atopia included a
touch of illusio.

Therein rubs the rub.  This space (espace) is both as "physical" and
as "virtual" as the Wall Street Journal or the Buffalo News's Poetry
Page.  Physical eyes read them in physical places on substances with
physical presences, made with the physics of physical labor.  The e-
utterance is located in space just as the news, op-ed human contact,
poetry and the funnies are all located in the moment, the moment
that we read them as much as the moment they are articulated.

Aside from mythic instantaneity (try accessing over-seas web pages
with a 28.8 modem), I don't see how this communication differs
drastically from me buying Essex Street/Tailspin books at a London
bookshop (which you can do) or subscribing to _The Nation_ via
airmail.

Oh... and Maria D., if you're listening.  That rejected collab you
did with Rasputin sounds interesting.  Any chance of me seeing a
copy, "e" or otherwise?

Longingly,

Martin

Seems to me one of the key things about Berrigan which he picked up on and
which has been picked up on in turn from him by many many "NY School"
poets is the fusion of formality & informality, of art & grunge - so that
they find sort of a lyrical balance and an integration of beauty &
everyday unofficial (& mostly moneyless & prestigeless) life.

This can only happen when there is an intense awareness & understanding
of art in all its arty grandeur coupled with an intellectual freedom
& scepticism about same coupled with a devotion to it which is natural
& not simply willed or calculated.

& it could probably only happen in New York at a certain time when art,
power & grunge competed on a level playing field.  "The Sonnets" are
art sonnets & improvised performance pieces combined.

Grunge is probably the wrong term for everyday living in a devoted bohemian
(poor) way.  & Berrigan sometimes seems self-indulgent, too obviously
performing that life.  But that's a view from far outside. (we don't have
grunge in Rhode Island.  we have coffee milk.)

just a few berrigan thoughts very calculatedly & stupidly self-centeredly
designed to remind readers that my own sonnet thing ISLAND ROAD at
Mudlark is designed as a reply to Berrigan, Berryman & Shakespeare
combined, with #4 Homage to Falstaff especially aimed at Berrigan.

Gwyn,

The only person I know of who is doing anything with ASL poetry is Dirksen
Bauman, who published a piece recently in the PMLA.  I don't know where
Dirksen is now, but you might be able to track him down through the
Binghamton English Dept.

Pet peeve: unannounced theme issues whose themes are decided beforehand by
editorial fiat, not evolving as a result of incoming material, which
latter I've been guilty of doing myself. But I've submitted places and had
work sent back with no explanation, only to find that they had been
planning a theme issue on Jewish writers, whom I admire jointly and
severally but can't claim to be, personally.

I've noticed the same thing.  One publications that I'm involved in is a
general circulation monthly on the arts that can only afford to do eight
pages a month.  After an interview an article a review the calendar,
there's enough space for about two (raw) pages of poetry.  That's never
stopped anyone from sending poems of 10 or more pages.  Hmmm...

More thoughts like these would definately help.  Nothing like stories from
the horse's mouth to make a point.  It might be fun to assemble them
(perhaps dropping the names...) into a little chapbook with a list of
resources & such.  "Your first guide to the world of journals" or "The
Dummies book of poetry publishing".  <grin>.

Beyond more thoughts like these, could any of you make suggestions on
resources (either print or online) that would help either periodical
publishers or poets in seek of publiation 'glory'.  I've got my own
feelings about SASEs & such.  What do others think of them, or of using say
a postcard instead?  Have any you found any unusual ways to publicize your
periodicals or that help you locate places to 'place' your poetry.  And on
and on.  I'm looking for any remotely relevant thoughts.  I've got
experience and a high dose of opinion in regards to publishing, but I'd
rather speak from more than just my little bit of ego.

thanks,
Tim

Hi, Erik:

You can get a copy of the Grove Press edition of _The Sonnets_ (1964) from
Pomander Books for $30.00. A lot of money, maybe, but not bad for this,
considering (a) I've seen it selling for $125.00 and (b) it has a very high
Groove Factor (like, 8 or 9). Contact Pomander at:

SZAVv@aol.com

I think Berrigan took as much, maybe more, from Philip Whalen. I also think
what he took from Whalen was ultimately more interesting than what he took from
O'Hara. All three are amazing poets.

Yours,

I don't know if Berrigan's really considered "some kid brother to O'Hara" by
every one here.  I think that his Sonnets are also going to be republished
soon, so   there must be some interest out there.  In a lot of ways he was
his own thing, you know.  Very funny and playful with language in ways
quite different from O'Hara.  Send me $5 and I'll send issue 8 of my magazine,
with two previously unpublished collaborations between him and T. Clark.

I recently asked you all why some poets like Ted Berrigan are ignored by the
"academy"  and no-one was interested enough to reply about how they see
Berrigan's work, well I guess you all are too busy talking about the WWW!,
I suppose the academy of the future is closing its doors to argue about
publishing on the web? If anyone wants a break, write to me and explain why
some critics call Berrigan an "ardent disciple" and like some kid brother to
Frank O' Hara. An imitator. His writings mean alot to me, and I would like
some discussion on the matter.

I'll mention briefly a specific magazine.  Yesterday I received Raddle
Moon 16, which conists of works by "Twenty-two new (to North America)
French writers..." On one skim, it's incredibly exciting stuff, and folks
should be sure to see it.  The list of translators reads like a who's-who
of the the interesting poets who are on this list or discussed here.  I've
never heard of any of the french poets, which isn't too surprising, but is
also an exciting aspect of it.  So far I've gotten thru the first
selection, "Heros Are Heros Are," by Manual Joseph trans. Susan Gevirtz:
pretty timely "gulf war" poem that reminds me a little of Spahr's superb
use of bureacratic deformations as a looped political poetic style in her
book Response; and "On my Desk," by Sabine Macher trans. Dodie B.: uses
ways of playing with writing that I'd done years ago and forgotten
about: how consciousness and words can hit and ricochet off specific
physical objects, and gain some really interesting torques, a kind of
spare approach to the-lyric-as-still-life. Very nice clipped rendering
into amerenglish..

The next 20 sections look just as sharp....

Hi everyone it's Kevin Killian . . .   I wanted to add my 25 cents and
recommend the new poetics journal "Tripwire" (very mindful that the "old"
Poetics Journal is coming to an end soon with its final issue). . . .
Living here in San Francisco I have long suspected there was a new
generation of poets with ideas and formulations very different than my own,
and "Tripwire" is now my handbook, as an anthropologist would have his
handbook . . .   It's quite wonderfully edited, by Morrison and Buuck,
always something interesting on almost every page, especially the
theoretical and critical work.  And many of the writers are new to me--yes,
there is a foregrounding of the "new,"--with Myung Mi Kim presiding over
the "new" in this vatic, patient way.  Anyhow it's well worth six dollars,
I say, go for it.  Schultz' essay about the difficulties of being a
working-class avant-garde writer is the finest I've ever read on the topic.
Robert Hale's and David Bucck's essays are also very fine on the exhaustion
of the approach to a degree zero of writing--Many of these young people
seem to have embarked on some kind of writing degree that presents itself,
in "Tripwire," as a kind of grail of disgust.  "Writing degree" = "zero"?
Sherry Brennan's overview of some recent books of poetry is good also, very
intriguing---though I wonder, given the fact that there are so many good
poets today, yet so few books published, that another review of Some Other
Kind of Mission, In Memory of My Theories, Imagination Verses, Metropolis
and Response--won't throw their authors into some kind of canon from which
it would be difficult to unseat oneself--They are so young and already they
(and Myung Mi Kim) are the gods of "Tripwire" . . .  it's interesting.

David Bromige! how good to hear from you. The reading today is Sherley
Anne Williams - who is a fiction writer. I don't believe in poetry
readings. on that note, I did manage to get word to Patrick Stewart that I
needed him to "read" (record) my poem "A Miscellany" which is culled from
1,000 pages of Elizabethan-era lyrics. When told that he was going to have
to do this, his brow grew deep with trenches, and the messenger relaying
this shrunk back. Mr. Stewart then told my friend the messenger to send
the work to his studio in LA. So...we'll see. I've got my fingers crossed
that what John Cage once said of Mac Low's play "The Marrying Maiden"
won't also be true of my poem: "Unless you do something to regulate
delivery, they'll read their lines like Shakespeare" (that's a paraphrase
from memory).

back to the rubble.

my sense of the girdle still itself among the rabble is that without
recognition the girdle would still be rabble. It is the raising up of the
girdle that gives it it its special halo. "I wanna be your halo"

Today the girder tomorrow the I-beam. or is an I beam a girder? any
construction workers out there? or more appropriate: anyone own a
construction company out there? I feel that there is a definate lack of
construction talk here on poetics.

on a more serious note, I have been meaning to ask this of poetics for
some time as my queries elsewhere have met up with a dead end. Perhaps
this won't bear any fruit, but there's hoping. I would like to find a
source (archival or attic-style) of the following:

1. prison literature. Specifically, I'd like to find a copy of "Iced Pig"
the magazine "published" by Sam Melville in the months immediately before
the Attica uprising. But I'm interested in other 60s/early70s era prison
publications, although I  realize that it might be a stretch to find
extant copie of such. The University of Michigan's Labadie Collection,
which has one of the best collections of civil liberties and civil rights
material in the usa, don't any such material, although they do collect
some material related to that, such as gay-rights prison literature.

2. I'm also trying to find a source for literature relating to the
conscientious objector movement. David Dellinger published "Pacifica
Views" which Mac Low I believe wrote a review for in the 1940s. Many of
these people were held long after the war, some were literally arrested
immediately upon being released (for not having their draft cards), which
is a kind of double jeopardy, it seems to me. I have a copy of "Prison
Etiquitte" which was published by Retort Press around that time--hand
printed on paper donated by James Laughlin. This is a rare book that I
found in a bookstore in Detroit last summer. "The Field of Broken Stones"
is another book published at that time. A memoir of Lowell Naeve, a CO who
was imprisoned at Danbury Fed Corr facility and rearrested. He was an
artist who would "wash off" old time magazines, literally making white
paper out of the magazines, thereby creating a sketch pad for himself.
Field of Broken Stones was co-written by David Wieck, a philosophy
professor at Rennselaer Polytech in Troy NY, who just died this past year
after a long bout with Alzheimers. Wieck was an old co editor of one of
the magainzes that Mac Low worked on in the 40s,early 50s. What I'm
looking for (as field of broken stons was reprinted by Alan Swallow and
shouldn't be that hard to find) what I'm really looking for are
"newsletters" edited and printed at the CPS (civilian public service)
camps--like Pacifica Views, but more fugitive and underground. PV was
fairly well established and is archived many places. Greenwood even did a
reprint I believe. Especially I'm looking for material from the Germfask
Michigan Camp, were the troublemakers were sent in a kind of american
style concentration camp. Most of the work camps were administered by the
Friends, the brothers, and the sisters, if you know what I mean. Germfask,
despite the shocking conditions, was still able to produce some kind of
newsletter. No one I've talked to has seeen a copy although I've read of
them. perhaps this isn't the place to ask.


please back channel with advice,


jail bird

The Berrigan thread is welcome, since I subscribed to list in the first
place for conversation about poetry and poetics. One of the sonnets, which
is not a sonnet, is an imitation of FO'H "I do this I do that" mode, which
mislead me at one point into thinking that Berrigan was a mere imitator of
O'Hara.  Since this poem doesn't really capture O'Hara's mode at all, I
thought he was a rather poor imitator, in fact. But this is a poor poem by
which to judge Berrigan. There are some interesting poems in one of the
early issues of Talisman, from the "500 Postcards" or something like that.

The whole 2nd generation New York school needs a 2nd look. How about Ron

Ch. Bernstein's essay on Berrigan in Content's Dream is very interesting
because it argues for a non-biographical reading. Any thoughts on this?

I'd agree with Gary Sullivan's analysis but also include Anselm Hollo,
whose lyric beauty and casualness seem to work in the same way as
Berrigan's, Whalen's, and O'Hara's.

Certainly Burrough's cut-ups would have been another big influence.  And what
about "Europe" written in Paris at almost exactly the same time that
Burroughs & Gysin were doing their collaborations there?  According to
Padgett, as late as 1960, Berrigan thought that "Europe" was based on _The
Golden Bough_.  So he makes the leap, somehow, from "The Wasteland to _The
Tennis Court Oath_, from high modernism to postmodernism, in only a year or
so.  (Query:  did "Europe" first appear in the limited edition book _The
Poems_?)

Gary, I wish you'd say more about the Whalen connection.  Ron Silliman
briefly mentioned in a recent post that Whalen was also a formative influence
for Coolidge's poetry.  I've heard this before somewhere, but don't really
see it; perhaps someone could spell this out as well.

Grunge was first introduced into the American vocabulary via Mark Arm from the

Maker in 1988, I would never equated the word grunge to Berrigan.

Thanky you very much Gary for the info on the Sonnets, you are just so kind to
tell me, I've been looking for a personal copy for awhile, mine is from the
library here, yes, I remember reading Berrigan write that he liked Whalen when
he went to the Berkeley poetry conference because he kept a distance from the
grandstannding that was going on and was very friendly.  Thanks again!!!

I was told by one of my teachers upon asking this very question--

That he was not particularly archetypal--

"Where Plath has been translated into many languages--Berrigan somehow
doesn't seem to strike the same kind of chord"--

This is one pretty "academic" response--

I personally think that Berrigan simply hasn't been pushed--he doesn't yet
have a collected (but I'm sure that will come along soon enough--), and
although he has passed away--he is still implicated in a lot of
contemporary poetic politics--he is still associated with a "camp" of
living writers--in the long run, perhaps--yes--like O'Hara (who isn't
particularly "archetypal" either....) he will, it seems to me, become more
"important"--

He is certainly an influence among younger writers--and, like Spicer and
Duncan and Loy--he will probably get "bigger" when those who have been
influenced by him get "bigger"--

Ron's mention of Hirschman provokes some memories.  In the late 1970s I
published a small chapbook by Jack called DOVE ROSE under the Viscerally Press
imprint.  (Side note: the cover art was by Hirschman's pal, the actor, Dean
Stockwell.) I don't think I even have a copy of the book any more.

Jack's an interesting figure: translator (see, for example, his work on
Artaud), Marxist and street poet with a surrealist flavor.  A warm and
generous personality.

strikes me as absolutely right-on, evoking for me the "organicism" discussed
by Don Byrd some weeks ago. I'd also like to thank Ron for forwarding that
epitaph of Jack, with whom I read once upon a time in the early 80s in North
Beach and who was everything his pals said he was. Jack Hirschman, by the
way, is alive and well (and healthy!) still with Sarah M. at last check,
still an unregenerate commie propagandist. Good to see some things don't
change!

Could someone please backchannel me to explain the command to get the full

Mark is dead-on, the most recent issue of _RM_ is inspiring, exciting, etc.,
etc.  There are some interesting resemblances to work being done in the
States -- eg. Christophe Tarkos' use of bracketed passages is a lot like
Juliana Spahr's in "documentary," and "responding."  Also, there are, in many
of the poems (Tarkos', Prouvost's), provocative and varied uses of
repetition.  I thought, too, that the xeroxes by Guetat-Livani are at least a
step beyond a lot of the stuff one generally sees in the vispo mags.

Jocelyn Saidenberg

Harryette Mullen has written three books of poetry, _Trimmings,
S*PeRM**K*T_, and _Muse & Drudge_.  Nina Wiener wrote in _Buzz Weekly_,

this show and get persuaded.  Join the crowd!

Jocelyn Saidenberg is one of the brightest stars to emerge from the San
=46rancisco State University Creative Writing department in recent years.
She has published in _Arshile, B-City, Stilts, 14 Hills_, and with bated
breath I await for her first book--_Mortal City_--to appear next year from
Parentheses Writing Series, and for the anthology _Tense Present_ which
will feature another grand helping of her work.  Saidenberg=B9s poetry is
formally rigorous and quite a challenge, yet underneath its coat of
_protective ice_ a warm heart beats and gives it power and endurance.
She=B9s the Ekaterina Gordeeva of poetry.

not to be cranky, but i don't quite see how talking about A poet or A poem
or Poets or Poems or or or is the proper (if that's what it is) or more
desirable (if that's what it is) subject matter for a list such as this...
which, as has been observed time and again over the years, may entertain
multiple threads...

so those of you who indicate something similar (i can take a hint):  please
go right ahead with Poems and Poets and such, if that's what moves
you---i'm all ears, i try NEVER to delete, and will occasionally chime
in... but no need to wring one's hands over a group within a group of folks
talking distribution/publication/medium/poetix, as these relate (or don't)
to Poets and Poems...

so there...

I wouldn't either if I was writing a dissertation. "Things to do in Providence"
has a grunge feel.  I'm using grunge as opposed to beat.  I think grunge
was invented in Minneapolis.  Now we're really getting somewhere.

all I mean is the "byt" (russian term for the everydayness of life, the
intimate ordinary, the grungy this that & the otherness of life.  that's
all I mean.  & I'm not saying Berrigan was a grunge poet.  I'm saying he
pointed up - balanced - juxtaposed - blended - art-sense & everydayness.
the demotic & the sublime.  a new way at an old way.  & I don't mean to hammer
away at this fairly obvious aspect, let's get down to some details - but I
just dont' want this misunderstood. He was an "urban poet" in that the
feel of the environment of the writing is urban & seeps into the poems
feel, rhythm, idiom, viewpoint.  there is nothing programmatic or
strategic in a literary sense on an obvious level about that, except the
lyric "beauty" is grounded in that environment which is a feel & is a
kind of suffering & grunge. - Henry G.

Jonathon, yes, Berrigan even admits at one point that he emulated the mode
with which O'Hara wrote poems.  His "It is 5:15 in ny" and so and so is all
part of his process in the poems. Berrigan takes lines from here and there and
either borrows them via collage into his work or sometimes takes a whole poem
by a poet like John Ashbery and writes between the lines, then finally putting
the poem together it is a response to the poem by Ashbery! I find this really
interesting the way he plays off of things, even in the Sonnets he borrows
lines from other poets and puts it all together in a new way.
As far as the O' Hara comparison goes, I felt that the critic who called him a
disciple, (i am not going to name names because it is not important plus I
respect the rest of her work, and like what she does as a critic) was merely
trying to find a place for him, as most critics do, Where does he fit in, o
well, I'll put him next to O'Hara because it is easy.
-What is not so easy is going back to the text, Sonnets, Bean Spasms, etc and
finding where he "borrowed" some lines from, or should I say was inspired to
add to his poems-He once said he put a lot of references into the sonnets so
scholars would look at his poems for years to come.
I love Bernstein's take on Berrigan in Content's dream, he even adds Berrigan
into a line from "Dark City" in the poem, "The lives of the toll takers" which
is incredible, he says something about Ted "bowl over" Berrigan and his "short
stabs" poems from 1968, its great

No books here at work today, so Whalen/Berrigan will have to wait until
tomorrow or Friday, so I can quote a few things. Erik, if you really want that
copy, e-mail Pomander's pronto--I think they only have one. Do you have a copy
of Whalen's _On Bear's Head_? I think you'd probably love it. It's been out of
print, like, "forever." You can find used paperback copies every now & then,
but if you can't wait, you can get a hardback copy for $25 from Second Life
Books in Lanesborough, MA. If interested, e-mail them at:

2ndlife@cbcc.bcwan.net

It's a great book. Also (& cheaper), _Heavy Breathing_, a "collected" of later
books, for $7.50, from Powell's Books in Portland, OR. I don't know what their
e-mail is, but you can order from them on-line by going to their website:

www.powells.com

Yes, Maxine, definitely Hollo, too. Missed his reading here last Saturday, but
saw him in Minneapolis maybe two years ago; he read a few sonnets from a recent
series, dedicated to Berrigan. My favorites among his work (read that day,
anyway) were his translations from the Greek Anthology.

Soon,

Gary Sullivan

True, they're not the Poetics List...

Ron Padgett will be on All Things Considered this afternoon, talking about
"From A Secret Location on the Lower East Side: Adventures in Writing
1960-1980". Tune in, turn on...

Those of you interested in talking about the so-called generations of the
New York School ought to come see the show, which features poetry magazines
from The Black Mountain Review all the way through L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E.

In addition to Mackey's readings at UIC, he is also reading in the series
Paul Hoover curates at Columbia College.  His reading there will take
place at 3 p.m. on April 16 in the Ferguson Theater, 600 South Michigan,
where he will be introduced by Art Lange, his collaborator on the Coffee
House jazz anthology, Moment's Notice.  The reading is free and open to
the public.

Martin,

I don't know the greek for irony either.

    Atopia is a non-community of men and women who share their language,
masks & placelessness, with each other that they may communicate their
(un)common ideas and help others to communicate theirs.
    The only requirement for membership in Atopia is a desire to
communicate. There are some dues and fees for access to Atopia, but hey,
that's life. We are self-sustaining through our placeless contributions.
Atopia is allied with many sects, denominations, politics and
oganizations; Atopia does at times wish to engage in communication;
Atopia endorses and opposes many causes. Our primary purpose is to
communicate at great distances with those we would have never met had
Atopia not come into being.

To paraphrase Billy Joel: "I'm in a placeless state of mind."

Atopia, be (t)here.

Truly (sincere),

Mike

Gary Lenhart or Joel Lewis or Simon Schuchat can probably speak to this
better than I (or you!) but my sense is that Berrigan wired the Whalen of
Bear's Head and Scenes of Life in the Capitol together with the Ashbery of
the uncollected poem "The Poems" (ever green review #8) and zapped them
into a very conservative matrix (some mix of a tate and vachel lindsay) to
get a satisfying frisson.. I repeat my flatulent assertion that the
sonnets is an ok work but tambourine life-train ride represents the major
period, the good stuff, the pepsi, the gem spa. Larry Fagin rumors the
original title of Bean Spasms was Lyrical Bullets and now that I've told
you it'll be hell getting more out of him.

Fuck communism,

A locus for this scene was St Mark's, and Blackburn should certainly
figure, although he managed to share (at times invent) the attributes of
several "schools" (often more like social circles) without wearing their

One of my favorite Berrigan books is RED WAGON--

Three of my favorite pieces:

CONVERSATION (I would reproduce it, but the form is too complex for
e-mail)

TODAY's NEWS

My body heavy with poverty (starch)
It uses up my sexual energy
        constantly, &
I feel constantly crowded

On the other hand, One
Day In The Afternoon of
    The World
Pervaded my life with a
    heavy grace
                today


I'll never smile again

Bad Teeth


But
I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
(I can't help myself!)   Tom
writes he loves Alice's sonnets,
    takes four, I'd love

to be more attentive to her, more
    here
The situation having become intolerable
the only alternatives are:
    Murder & Suicide.

They are too dumb! So, one
becomes a goof. Raindrops
start falling on my roof. I say
Hooray! Then I say, I'm going out

At the drugstore I say, Gimme some pills!
    Charge 'em! They say
Sure. I say See you later.

Read the paper. Talk to Alice.
She laughs to hear
   Hokusai had 947 changes of address
In his life. Ha-ha. Plus everything
   else in the world
going on here.


I USED TO BE BUT NOW I AM

I used to be inexorable,
But now I am elusive.

I used to be the future of America,
But now I am America.

I used to be part of the problem,
But now I am the problem.

I used to be part of the solution, if not all of it,
But now I am not that person.

I used to be intense, & useful,
But now I am heavy, & boring.

I used to be sentimental about myself, & therefore ruthless,
But now I am, I think, a sympathetic person, although easily amused.

I used to be a believer,
But now, alas, I believe.

Jack Hirschman is alive and well here in SF...still reading at demos, pickets,
whatnot (with all his furor)... .translating mallarme recently...etc..

Jack wouldn't be passing out CP papers really...he used to run with the CLP,
from which the LR (league of revolutionaries) of which he's a part of --
split.
Like many of the less sectarian socialists, his group LR as well as Socialist
Organizer, along with PFP (peace and freedom) and elements of Socialist Action
(as well as other left melieu -- fragmentia -- ) are, or are striving to be,
non-obstructionist entrents into the Labor Party (Golden Gate Branch)...a
party that has a medium-sized but dedicated (and growing!) base in the Trade
Union movt...Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers, United Electrical, ILWU
(longshoremen) etc..as well as other Pol. groupings, eg. National Welfare
Rights Union..BWJ..Black Workers for Justice..

Jack hates the Net and its culture (though I'm not aware that he's all that
informed on the important political work that sometimes get done through the
net. He'd have something colorful to say if he got wind of this posting!

And though our poetics differ greatly both formalistically and...and what? in
affekt

We both agree on the (urgent) need to de-sectarianize the left...this process
is one that I think (or hope) is taking shape in the cultural sphere as well.

Tom or somebody else,

Duncan dedicates a poem to Dean Stockwell somewhere (I think it's in
_Bending the Bow_, but I'm at work and my copy's at home).  What's up with
him and poetry?  This is just an interesting (to me) possible side thread.

To everybody re the recent lament that a volume of Lyn Hejinian's essays
has never been done (sorry, I don't remember whose post), UC Press is
working on a collection of Lyn's critical writing right now. Don't know
what the publication schedule is, but it will likely be announced on the
Press's web site, http://www-ucpress.berkeley.edu, when the pub. date's
confirmed.

And for anybody in the Bay Area, Lyn will be reading with Barrett Watten at
UC Berkeley on March 17 at 4pm at the Townsend Center for the Humanities in
220 Stephens Hall. Barrett will be giving a talk, "The Constructivist
Moment: From El Lissitsky to Detroit Techno," the previous day, same time
and place. The Townsend Center can be reached at (510) 643-9670 for more
info.

Joe, just checked in -- I read the list exclusively via the archive these
days -- and the discussion seems to have moved on . . . but I really think
we agree in any case. My only point, all along, has been that given the
significant corpus of electronic poetry that _already_ exists for us the
critical project would be well served by a turn toward sustained engagements
with individual works or groupings of works -- and a turn away from more
sweeping, speculative gestures. Certainly this is where I feel my own
energies being pulled . . . The only electronic writing (prose or poetry)
I'm aware of that's accumulated _any_ amount of really careful, thick
discussion is Joyce's _afternoon_ -- which is not to say other works have
not received notice and occassionally been commented upon, but I don't see
that they've been much _studied_.

Anyhow, back to Ted Berrigan. Matt

By a strange coincidence, NPR ran a story tonight on the exhibition of NY
School mimeo magazines at the Public Library.  Berrigan, one of the curators
says, is the star of the exhibit.  Padgett and Waldman were interviewed, the
Donald Allen's anthology & the Poetry Project discussed, & the existence of
"another tradition" leaked at last to the general public -- all together a
very pleasant surprise.  Plus, following the story, an explanation of what
mimeo actually is -- I was never quite sure.

the questions of first-publication, republication etc. editors of ezines
receive from contributors are one index of the "view" on these venues.  when
rif/t debuted several years ago, loss and i recv'd boat-loads of
questions/queries/concerns about whether online publication "counted", whether
work could be previously or subsequently published in print, etc.

as a practical matter (and because in '93 there was precious little online
poetry in the poetics-list vein) we encouraged submission of work prev
published in journals ... and urged that online publication shouldn't preclude
subsequent print publication.
Felicitoiusly, most print editors at seemed to class online pub with the
circulation of home-made broadsides . . . viz: not publication, --- audiences
for journals and web (gopher) mutually exclusive.

The question seems to worry poets less in 98 (poetics-list traffic
notwithstanding...); a reflection of what, growing acceptabilty of online
publishing?  reification of the 'separate but equal' doctrine?  perhaps a
coming to terms with concerns for the issue of ephemerality (as digital text
returns to haunt us, refusing deletion)...

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

This in response to something in one of Joel Kuszai's recent posts.-- It
strikes me as an oddly undemocratic vision for Reznikoff--or Oppen, who
approved of this line--to (as Joel so well says) "put a halo" around one
piece of the rubble, consigning the rest ("huddled masses") to the
garbage-scow of history. Consider the reader. S/he identifies with the
girder ("I am a girder") and so what does that make the rest of us? Not a
brick here and a bike wheel there and a single mitt here but--mere
rubble.("rabble," as Joel puns). Or s/he identifies with the rubble--so who
is that jerk who thinks he's a girder and we others are undifferentiated
trash?

"I saw the girder
 first was still itself
 and then brick by brick
 and then the bike wheel,
 then the dead cat, each
 halo'd with identity"


but perhaps american poetry no matter the marxism of its writer cannot
transcend the cult of rugged individual ("resistant as a girder") and still
be received as fine. I certainly don't care for what I just made up and put
in lines. But I do care that this reznikoff girder-poem is in bad faith.

A number of people have back-channelled me about the issue of community and
publishing.  A couple people have pointed out that editors tend to get their
work published elsewhere and that they think that publishing can be tantamount
to the dread "self-promotion."  I find this some what disturbing as I know for
a fact that there are a lot MFA kids out there who get really angry that no
one is publishing their poems, but are absolutely unwilling to do anything to
help others get their work out.  Wondering:   these people who just flood the
magazines by submitting to magazines they've never even seen and don't do
anything for anyone else, could they be the selfish ones?  On the other hand,
a number of people have back-channelled me to say that they are afraid to
publish "forward" "radical"  "anti-this, pro-that" stuff because they don't
want to be like those "power hungry" "acadominant" language poets. Whatever
your opinion on those guys, I just want to say publishing your own magazines
might be the only way to combat that problem.  Perhaps an obvious point. In
the mean time, I would like to say that as an editor/publisher, if you send
out forty-seven copies of the same poem to different magazines...what is that
if not self-promotion.  I think it is sort of a useless notion.
Also, I think people who want to be in magazines should also pay for them.
Think of it as union dues.  One cannot join a community by sitting alone in a
room.

A few others have said that they were encouraged by my post and are now going
forward with their publishing plans.  I think we're all for more of
everything.

Not very many people have e-mailed me in an effort to discuss magazine
concepts.  However, one idea that I particularly like re: community is the
following:  invite 12 of your favorite writers/friends/erstwhile-friends to
send you 2 poems a month.  They would send 2 poems xeroxed say 30 times.  All
these would be stapled together by the "editor" and then mailed back to the
writers and others.  At the end of the year, a sort of "best of" would be
printed.  I think this is an exciting concept (a bit like Open City? not sure)
that could make for very interesting sort of cross-talk, conversation,
collaboration, etc.  A perfect way to get a snap shot of what people are doing
over a given year, getting an idea of what people have tried and perhaps even
failed.

I'd be very interested to hear from others who have inclusive ideas for
publishing.

1.  Somewhere Ted has a poem "Old Master Story" which goes: John Ashbery
heads/Philip Whalen tails  (or something to that effect).

2.  I agree with Jordan that Train Ride & Tambourine Life are pinnacles
of achievement -- they are also not from the same "period" and are quite
different works, albeit both much learned (accent on the second syllable)
out of Whalen.  Tambourine life is a settled existence, at home, and
Train Ride is in motion, etc, etc.

3.  Ted once told me that he was very influenced by Miles Davis in
writing the Sonnets.  (He may have also made this assertion in an
interview or teaching a class, i.e., there may be a citation beyond my
own memory.)  (I also don't think I understood what he meant.)

4.  The John Cage Interview.

5.  Henry's suggestion re "grunge" or the "grittiness of the quotidienne"
are part of where Ted's practice intersects with (as Mark notes) Paul
Blackburn, of whom Ted often spoke.

6.  Ted was a big fan of Conrad Aiken.  Actually, he read all poets, and
excepting some near contemporaries, liked them all.  He told me how much
he liked a particular poem by Richard Wilbur.  He was Clark Coolidge's
big champion.  I.e., Ted was -- as he often said -- catholic.  He also
was influenced by everything he ever read, heard, saw, or said.

NPR Funding
This is being forwarded to several people at once to add their names
to the petition.  NPR (National Public Radio) and the arts are facing
major cutbacks in funding.

It won't matter if many people receive the same list as the names are
being managed. This is for anyone who thinks NPR/PBS is a worthwhile
expenditure of $1.12/year of their taxes.  A petition follows.  If
you sign, please forward on to others (not back to me).  If not,
please don't kill it-send it to the email address listed here:
wein2688@blue.univn PBS.

In spite of the efforts of each station to
reduce spending costs and streamline their services, some government
officials believe that the funding currently going to these programs
is too large a portion of funding for something which is seen as not
worthwhile.
Currently,taxes from the general public for PBS equal $1.12 per
person per year, and the National Endowment for the Arts equals $0.64
a year.
A January 1995 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll indicated that 76% of
Americans wish to keep funding for PBS.  This percentage of people
polled is surpassed only by national defense and law enforcement as
the programs that are the most valuable for federal funding.  Each
year the Senate and House Appropriations committees each have 13
subcommittees with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies. =

Each subcommittee passes its own appropriation bill.  The goal each
year is to have each bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year,
which is October 1.
The only way that our representatives can be aware of the base of
support for PBS and funding for these types of programs is by making
our voices heard.
Please add your name to this list and forward it to friends if you
believe in what we stand for. This list will be forwarded to the
President of the United States, the Vice President of the United
States, and Representative Newt Gingrich, who is the instigator of the
action
to cut funding to these worthwhile programs.
*If you happen to be the 150th, 200th, 250th, etc. signer of this
petition, please forward a copy to:
        wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu.
        If that address is inoperative, please send it to:
kubi7975@blue.univnorthco.edu.  This way we can keep track of the
lists and organize them.  Forward this to everyone you know, and help
us to keep these programs alive.
        Thank you.

hello all,

Just noticed that neither Mark's nor Jacques's posts happens to refer to
Stacy Doris or Norma Cole, the editors of RADDLE MOON 16, the new French
writing issue and I didn't want their work to be mis-attributed or
overlooked.

Norma and Stacy are responsible for discovering the writers [many of
whom are un- or little-known in France] and arranging the vital
translator-translatee couplings. They are the guest editors of the issue
and it was a big pleasure to host them in RM. Each of them has written a
note in the back of the issue on the process.

[that's] *bonne* route,
Susan -- ever careless of gender ...

Not to gloat too much, but I scored a discarded library copy of Whalen's
_On Bear's Head_  from the retired book store of the Harold Washington
library for a quarter. It's sad to see a book like that being taken off
the shelves, but I think I've given it a good home. Other recent finds
there include Joe Ceravolo's Spring in the World of Poor Mutts, and
Jonathon William's  An Ear in Bartram's Tree, from which this timely poem
on WCW's death, 35 years ago today...

WCW: March 4, 1963

I like it
that you died

the month
spring comes.

I could also add a timely Berrigan poem about Joe Brainard's Collage about
Williams ("he's not in it, the hungry dead doctor"), but my copy of _The
Sonnets_ is on loan to a friend.

My heading is the punch line of a joke I heard earlier today.  Which reminded
me of Michael Gottlieb's poem "Timing is Everything," a text composed entirely
of punch lines. It first appeared in an issue of __This__.  I don't recall
ever seeing it collected into a book.  It bears looking at.  A wonderful
example of composition by collage principle, not to mention Henny Youngman's
principles.

Care to share your thoughts on digital poetics?  I've been pondering
(yesy, the hint of slow thinking is intended) visual poetics.  Have not
seen much that on either that moves me but suspect and hope that these
"poetics" are not simply copies of or departures from current verbal
poetics, art movements, or e-poetics.

i would say: a writers job is to exist. by definition: a writer writes. it
need not be a "job", it just is.
but writers must exist, and it should be their job to continue to exist.
(and by writing, i do not mean the physical act of ink to paper, sound from
mouth, etc.) every writer is, by extension, a thinker. and without people
thinking...
so: the writer's job is to exist, and (again: by extension) to further the
existance (i.e. to incite others to write/think).

the girder amid the rubble, while conjuring images of odd journeys I've
taken through endless piles of junk, rubble, garbage, and places like the
tracks in portland's brooklyn yards where it was a mile walk to school
each day (and this was the time that I really dug into Oppen and
Reznikoff). not surprisingly, i also have lots of pictures of that time.
everything in black and white. democratic? eh? I don't hear anyone saying
anything, and as far as I know that girder can't vote. seriously, what I
always got from that scene wasn't so much the rugged individualism of the
any-body could be a self, with a little effort (and if you knew someone,
had rich parents, etc.) but instead related to the kind of optics of
seeing, which i guess is a kind of party line objectivist thinking.
certainly this is different in oppen and zukofsky and niedecker and then
of course the whole objectivst school as any recognizable thing comes
collapsing down on anyone trying to put anything up about it. certainly
you do get the patronizing "suzie had a self" in oppen in moments of his
poems, although I still love those poems, the "her name was Phyllis, not
neo-classic" section. The part where she's riding the bus home, her first
job, etc., and there are these lines (i don't have my oppen with me, and
quite frankly havent thought about him seriously in some time, so i might
have this wrong) the lines after that where he writes that she steps down
off the bus, something to the effect that she sees *(or is)* "a spot of
light on the pavement"--in any event that oppen-esque spotlight is beaming
on her--there is a beauty to the recognition, in oppen's rhetoric (I
think) that she exists, that he can say that she exists, or if she can,
that she will. "Speak if you can," etc.

These lines were terribly important to me, and I was schooled at one point
by the girder. And I love David's reading of the girder & think it quite
correct. I guess I'm resistant to slam this though, because somehow I can
take something away from that moment of recognition, without being blasted
by oppen's "spot of light on the pavement" as if it were making an
incandescent candle of her, or me, for wanting it to be. But I still don't
think that it is somehow undemocratic--I think there is a version of
version of democracy which is exactly this "I could win the Lotto" and "I
influence elections" kind of thinking. What is the substitute for
democracy implied here? Fascism? One poet rule? Also implied by this sense
of the girder as individual, with the "masses" shaded in the background,
is that there is a more "democratic" way to handle the trash of the vacant
lot, a way that doesn't set one in front of other. Part of what I had
thought he was trying to accomplish had to do with not being lost in the
fuzzy glare of undifferentiated phantasmagoric sensory data. Perhaps a
simple lesson in imagism, slightly (at all?) refined?

I'm curious how you read the first poem I mentioned. A poem made as an

Not that Reznikoff needs to be defended at this point and not that anyone
cares anymore, but the only bad faith here in this complaint about
Reznikoff is Kuszai's and Bromige's infatuation with their own readings of
the poem.

Neither of you ever wonder if the poem might NOT set the girder in a
hierarchical relation with its surroundings.  Is it possible that "still
itself among the rubble" means that the girder is itself still rubble but
that such a denomination is not able to totalize it as object?  The poem
seems to say that the world exists before judgment comes along to sort
things out.  The identity of the individual is exactly what gets called
into question as the object blurs such distinction.

Another problem is that, when you read the poem in context, it seems
obvious to me that there is no such halo or aura given to this image or any
other detail of Reznikoff's poems.  'Profane' and 'sacred' have no place in
Reznikoff's lexicon because he does not categorize the world as such.

I think you are barking up the wrong girder.

shd call yr-all's attention to the latest _open letter_ entitled "Disgust
and Overdetermination: a poetics issue" guest edited by jeff derksen.
opening sentence from derksen's eponymous introduction reads: "If, as
Sianne Ngai writes in the essay that contributes to the title of this
poetics issue, 'disgust, and not desire, is our most common affective
response to capitalism and patriarchy,' then much of the work in this
_Open Letter_ points to, addresses, and registers its disgust at the logic
that creates the social relations that make us want to puke" (7).

much tasty stuff (!) to be had here: work also by deanna ferguson,
brian kim stephans, miles champion, clint burnham, nancy shaw & catriona
strang, scott pound, louis cabri, andrew levy, rob manery, karen mac
cormack, tjsnow, christian bok (from the forthcoming "eunoia" project),
caroline bergvall, kevin davies, peter jaeger, darren wershler-henry,
dorothy trujillo lusk, mark tadao nakada, and dan farrell.

will also chime in support for raddle moon 16.  highlights for me so far
-- again, lots to chew on here -- the work by albane prouvost (yes to
whoever said it, powerful use of repetition), kati molnar (syntax and use
of caps), and oscarine bosquet (tr. michael palmer).

get and enjoy,

the right, yes. but can an artist, once they have started down the path,
really leave it? in my experiance: no. everyone i have known who has tried
to stop has gone mad, or have chosen other ways of art.
so: does art have to justify existance? no. does the artist have to be an
artist? yes. it is a choice, but one you get stuck with.
besides: it may be a pain in the arse, but it is worth it.

are we? i don't know you. i don't know what you look like, sound like, etc.
i don't know how you live your life. all i have are words floating on a
screen. i can make assumptions, and even learn and somewhat communicate. but
to me you can only be a collection of electronic words. i assume that
someone put them together, but i don't know who it is. so the annalogy of a
letter from a friend is false. i know my friends. i spend as much time with
them as possible. and when i get a letter: i hold it, read it. sometimes it
smells like them or their home. with email: i have electic lights burning my
eyes. i hold a mouse and keyboard. granted: getting this email from you is
better than nothing, but it's important to realize that people are
"settling" for this over going out and talking to people. i know scores of
people who just sit in their houses all day on the puter. it's safe. they
don't have to try to be anything. but at the same time they can't fully
express themselves, and thus get to know anyone really. one fella i know,
who has a phd in philosophy (and thus no job), used to be one of my favorite
people to talk to. he was so animated and interesting. we'd drink tea and go
all night about various subjects. but now he has no time for "talking". he
doesn't come out. it's easier to sorta talk to a hundred people, than to
really talk to one.
okay: i don't know about anyone else: but when i'm reading (anything from
whitman to herodotus) i will at times catch myself reading out loud and
pacing around the room (both of which horribly annoy my wife). i feel
stimulated. i get excited and further annoy laura by reading passages to her
and try to get her to talk about it while she's studying or painting. this
excitement is inflammed when i go to a reading, or am just being read to by
a friend. on the puter i get bored after a while. and yet i sit here because
at times i forget about other things. the puter becomes my world. and this
world burns my eyes, leaves me alone in a room, etc. yet here i am.
all of written history is not damned by this. every book is different in
basic physicality, as well as in content. every book leads to a new book:
others by that author, biographies, books by contemporaries, sources, etc.
this leads to deeper understanding of those we can no longer go and see.
(this all leads to discussion, human interaction, in most cases.) and those
we can still see we should demand to see, as the last year has proved,
before it's too late.
it'd be one thing if the puter was just a tool to get in contact with
people, but it is increasingly becoming a substitute for physical contact.
and i loose coherence a little easier.
jeff.

sorry. i somehow missed that post, but i'll give ya my feelings...
i think a lot of people get confused because it is easy to read tb as an
extension of frank and co. and so with this simple disqualification they
move on to the next poet. they don't get into tb, recognize his individual
qualities, etc.
i think that this may be the fault of a tendency to only see a "movement" as
it's founder, instead of the sum of the parts. each part being an important
individual part, without which the whole would collapse.
this is also why many "late beat poets" get overlooked, as well as some of
the "minor black mountain poets". people just as good, if not better, than
their "elders", but overlooked due to basic similarities and thus marginalized.

One of the facets of the web that I like is that writing will increasingly be able to exist, be, without attachment to a
human being, i.e., no "name," no personable voice characteristics, no attractive or charismatic person attached--in short,
an increase in anonymously generated language objects whose sole value will be what is on the page.  One among many
reasons I would like to see more of this someday is the thought of writers who have been limited in mobility (thus
couldn't do a lot of readings to get people to look seriously at their writing), or limited in oral motor faculties (thus
couldn't get people to hear the inflection of their "voices"), or limited by a host of social and material advantages
(thus couldn't buy attention to their writing), or limited in psychological lust for attention (thus couldn't or wouldn't
want more from their writing than that it exist).

I hope folks don't mind me banging my own tambourine, but I'd like to
recommend Ted Berrigan's On The Level Everyday: Selected Talks On Poetry
and the art of living, edited by me and published by Talisman House (at
better book stores and thru amazon.com)-- it is wonderful example of a poet
thinking thru process and letting young writers in on the serious business
of being a poet. The book is a result of a vow I took when ted died--that I
would do what I could to keep his work alive. That younger writers, who can
only imagine his bigger-than-life personality, have taken to his work moves
me.

The genius of the work is how it moves easily between the radical and
personal poetic. Ted, himself, came to see the Sonnets late in life as work
about "growing up in a certain way." He thought that Tambourine Life was
more influential as it was in a Paul Carroll anthology that did about 40,00
copies + being in Many Happy Returns that went thru two printings.

Ted was amazingly catholic in his taste. He loved poets like Aiken (to whom
he mailed the sonnets--see aiken's response in his selected letters) &
Roethke & felt distant from poets-on-a-mission types like Ted Enslinn.
Whalen was of hugh importance --especially in spatial arrangement and
freedom of movement & if gary lenhart is out there lurking, he once
suggested to me that whalen's decline as an influential  poet has a lot to
do with the demise of his biggest booster --Ted.

Blackburn may have been Ted's hidden poetic influence to the point of Ted
denying his poetic influence and only acknowledging a certain moral
influence. And among the grunge--ashbery. Ted told me that when he met
robert raushenberg for the first time, the painter said to him: "Oh, you're
the guy who imitates Ashbery." Ted sd: "That wasn't so great, but if he
said:'You're the guy that imitates O'Hara " -- then I'd REALLY be crushed".
I was teaching some of his poems in my class and noticed his sense of
shifting surface and language texture is much like the pre-self portrait
ashbery.

Which brings me to a point that I have never seen much discussed on the
list: POETRY & CLASS. Ted was one of the few major poets to come from a
working class background -- and he was constantly aware of it.,One major
reason he held no non-poetry job from '66 to his death had a lot to do w/
his father, who was being trained to be classics scholar and had to give up
those dreams and work in a bread factory when his dad died. Ted's dad died
after a petty dispute w/ his bosses over automation. Ted said that he never
wanted this to happen to him. I know among the theory crowd, these bits of
personal anecdotes are no's-no's, but they go a long way in explaining ted
and his poetry. I think the affinity that ted and olson shared (they once
spent all night on a park bench in buffalo talking poetry!) was the shared
working class/catholic/ ethnic background. In retrospect, that was part of
my attraction to ted as a person was he knew from the world of scrimping
and chuck steak I grew up in. This may have been the reason who moved away
from being labeled an avant-garde poet and settled into a variant
avant-populism of the poetry from Red wagon on.

Thought we'd take advantage of the current discussion of small press
magazines, and announce the second issue of our journal, The Germ, due
out this April.

If you haven't seen the first edition, copies are still available.

others. The journal's perfect-bound, 224 pages with a smashing cover by
Rikki Ducornet, and ends with reviews and commentary.

Just thought we'd add this note:

The Germ is now accepting book reviews--critical writing has been
particularly hard to come by. If you have material anywhere from 2-8
pages in length addressing contemporary poetic works or issues, we'd love
to see it.

Specific books we'd be interested in receiving reviews of:

Fanny Howe, _One Crossed Out_
Sianne Ngai, _Discredit_
Andrew Joron's forthcoming book
Lisa Robertson, _Debbie, An Epic_
Keith Waldrop, _Analogies of Escape_
Merrill Gilfillan, _Satin Street_

(though this is by no means an exhaustive list)

We're currently printing reviews of Peter Gizzi's _Artificial Heart_ and
Lisa Robertson's _XEclogues_, and have previously run pieces on Susan
Howe's _Frame Structures_, John Clarke's _In the Analogy_, Will
Alexander's _Towards the Primeval Lightning Field_.

If you happen to already have uncommitted work, and could get it to us
within the next week, we still have tentative space open for issue #2.
Otherwise, work received will be considered for the third edition, due
out in the fall. There's an unfortunate poverty of critical writing in
small poetry magazines, and this is an area we'd like to expand in our own.

Please send all material to: The Germ, P.O. Box 8501, Santa Cruz, CA 95061.

Or drop us a note at macgregr@cats.ucsc.edu

Thanks

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

It hardly seems useful of Grant Jenkins to say of this topic "not that
anyone cares anymore" while in the process of addressing it with fresh
information. Nor does it seem useful to characterize my reading (& Joel
Juszai's distinctly other reading) as "infatuations," then for him to offer
his own reading, presumably likewise a matter of infatuation. Or if it is
not, perhaps he would clarify the distinction between "infautate" and
"non-infatuate" readings. I.e.,is an infatuated reading one one disagrees
with? If so,there are surely more handy terms to apply in making such
distinction.

I'll try one more time. The phrase "still itself" is the one that strikes
me as less than alert. We are not concerned with the selfhood of _girders_
here, in this poem. Surely that phrase adds something to what Grant calls
"perception."

"Look, a girder there among the rubble " would register perception. But
because it can be read (and surely not perversely) as "Look, that girder is
still itself among that rubble which isn't," I have, for cause I previously
stated, found it halfbaked. An opinion I hold of very little work by either
Reznikoff or Oppen. And so it has long intrigued me that Oppen singled it
out (as Rez the girder) for something like praise.I agree with Grant
Jenkins that Reznikiff isn't in thre habit of "haloing" objects, and that
is what I object to here, where I believe Joel is correct in saying that he
does.

I'm willing to admit at this point that my trouble with this line =a blind
spot of mine, because I don't think I can articulate my impression any
further.  Thanks for the debate.  David

Coolidge met Phil Whalen at the '63 Vancouver Poetry Festival where he also
met many other folks (including one of the attendees, a then very young
Michael Palmer, with whom CC would go on to edit Joglars).

I can't think of where Coolidge may actually talk about his relationship to
Whalen in print, although I've heard him do so in person. However, if you
want to see the work that I think is almost the perfect wedding of the
influences of Whalen AND Berrigan, it's THE ROAD LOG, printed in the
Coolidge issue of Big Sky (ed. by Bill Berkson, intro by Tom Clark), pub. in
Bolinas in 1972. Two long and "airy" to type up this late before I trundle
off to work this morning.

One reason why I think there's been so little critical discussion to date of
Ted Berrigan is that he was such a strong personality and would have so
obviously disapproved of such, that people who actually knew the man feel
that inhibition internally. There was a good 15 year break after the death
of Jack Spicer when I think the same general effect took place, the only
person actively promoting Jack's work being Paul Mariah as part of his
campaign to make room for a specifically gay poetics. But so many people in
Jack's world retreated from the SF poetry scene (to Vancouver or Bolinas or
just away from poetry, as Harold Dull did in spite of those fine early
books) and so there wasn't the same sense of them being around to disapprove
of the discourse (Can you imagine what Jack would have thought of that
boundary2 issue??) when us "younger" folks who didn't know Jack personally
(there's mention in the Kevin/Lew bio of Spicer -- due out now in just 8
weeks -- of a party on Etna at the Berkeley Poetry Conference in '65  that I
attended where apparently Spicer was present, though I certainly was unaware
of it at the time) could come forward without that restraint. When I gave my
talk on Spicer's Language at 80 Langton Street I wasn't sure there would be
any audience, and was shocked literally to see it become an SRO event --
there were all these "closet" Spicer afficianados out there.

Just as there are now ones of Berrigan (Jordan, I personally love The
Sonnets, although I agree that it was an unrepeatable work). But Ted's
students, formal and otherwise, are everywhere and very active in today's
poetry, and I think they all know exactly how Ted would react to a boundary2
type of treatment.

We may have to wait another 10 years before such discourse really takes off.

Also, even if Ted looked like Eddie Vetter's father, I don't believe you
could call anyone whose music collection in 1959 centered on Arthur Godfrey
"grunge."

Didn't the Language Poets disapprove of him?  That might be another reason.

Do we have to keep using the narrow current top-40 meaning of this word
to gently mock what I was saying?  The term "grungy" has been honorable slang
for the grittiness of street life since long before guys in Minneapolis
& Seattle stopped tucking in their flannel shirts.  That's all I meant
& mean & an elephant's word is 100%.  - Henry Gould

Dear Ted Heads:

The moves, sense of humor, mock-heroics, self-questioning, and collage-effect
in Berrigan's work of the mid to late sixties are all things taken, in some
part, from Philip Whalen's work of the previous decade. But the crucial element
Berrigan latched onto, the most interesting to me, anyway, is how Whalen's work
is situated in time. Whalen described his poems as "continuous nerve movies," a
fitting description of poems of Berrigan's like "Tambourine Life" and "Train
Ride."

Whalen's poetry, though often "chatty" and focused on the "quotidian," differs
from O'Hara's in that, when O'Hara says "I do this, I do that," he's referring
to the past. What I experience, reading O'Hara, is more akin to memory than to
immediate experience:

AT THE OLD PLACE

Joe is restless and so am I, so restless.
Button's buddy lips frame "L G T TH O P?"
Across the bar. "Yes!" I cry, for dancing's
my soul delight. (Feet! Feet!) "Come on!"

Through the streets we skip like swallows.
Howard malingers. (Come on, Howard.) Ashes
malingers. (Come on, J.A.) Dick malingers.
(Come on, Dick.) Alvin darts ahead. (Wait up,
Alvin.) Jack, Earl and Someone don't come. [...]

I don't imagine O'Hara writing that "as it happens," despite his persistent use
of the present tense. (Hard to skip and write at the same time. Or have lunch
with LeRoi Jones, etc.) Whalen, however, is not, like O'Hara, describing (or
sometimes pretending to describe) his life. He is describing the act, and the
situation, of writing. Or he is (forgive the enigmagism) "writing himself
writing":

DELIGHTS OF WINTER AT THE SHORE

A little sauce having unglued me from my book
I take the present (Ernest Bloch on the phonograph)
I salute the fire in the fireplace
The red sectional settee
All the potted plants I moved onto the diningroom table
so they could get more light
And beyond the window North Pacific Ocean

An editor writes to me, "Takes, takes, all the time takes ... what
are you scared of, nobody's trying to cut your throat ...
Why don't you just sit down & write a novel?"

& wild with energy & power I'm curled up in the grey reclining chair
Carefully writing one letter at a time

Check the barometer .......... falling
Check the swiss steak in the oven .....
......turn up the heat

It goes like that, all the "talent," the "promise"
My mortgage very nearly foreclosed
My light going out

X. Keeps telling me how sad everything is
(He cries all the time)
Maybe he's right, but I don't *see* sad
& the pursuit of happiness around a square track

How loyal have I been to myself?
How far do I trust .... anything?
I wonder "self-confidence" vs. years of self-indulgence
(am I feeling guilty?)
How would anything get done if I quit? Stopped
whatever it is you choose to call it?

Put it as fancy & complicated as possible:
Here I sit drunk beside the biggest ocean in the world
Tosca destroying me on the phonograph
Everybody else in the world dying of starvation, cruelty
lack of my love

No amount of promise or talent about to do anything to fix that.
It was 20 years ago they worried about what I might do
Now everybody can see what I've done, what I'm doing

Everybody starves
Everybody is a huge (biological) success
Everybody's maybe like me: perpetually scared
& not giving a shit
As long as there's beef in the oven
Out of jail
Drunk

Everybody says Horace was a two-bit snob, writing
"Odi profanum vulgis"
Maybe he meant he hated himself for being lazy, preferring old wine
Pretty girls & sunshine
To the dignity & usefulness of public office?

Now the Second Act of Tosca:
Big party downstairs, the cantata going on
Police interrogation upstairs, Cavaradossi on the rack
(These palazzi--a real idea of splendor)
& topping it all off, as if it explained E V E R Y T H I N G

"Vissi d'arte, vissi d'amore ..." I've lived for Art,
I've lived for love ..."
(incontinently stabbing the villain)

DIE!                    DIE!                    DIE!

I eat an olive out of my glass

TOSCA: "... tutta Roma!"

& 1 is left

Some psychiatrist says "Quotation, a relaxation for, an evasion by the id."

I eat the second final olive & pretend to hurl my glass
into the fireplace
I don't actually throw it, the glass isn't mine & there's a screen
in front of the fireplace [...]

"Writing himself writing"--I think of Andrew Levy's "The shadow of the head
falling over the page" ... as well as much of the last 20, 30 years of
investigation. Whalen, I tend to think, is one of the least acknowledged living
influences of late 20th Century American poetry.

In an interview with Anne Waldman, Whalen describes his discovery of "writing
like this," with "IF YOU'RE SO SMART, WHY AIN'T YOU RICH?," written in 1955:
"... the first time I got out of the whole imagist kind of idea that I had been
into for years, that whole thing about a poem should be short, exact, with not
very many words and that it should have one complete feel or smell to it. And
that poem was the first place where I could suddenly see that it didn't
necessarily have to be that but it could be what I was going to be or what it
was going to be itself, and it started making itself and I started having to go
along behind it and write it the way it was ... To me at that time that poem
'IF YOU'RE SO SMART' was a great burst through, and all my dopey theories and
hangups and things about writing and a thousand other things suddenly
disappeared ..."

Note how he describes the experience of writing: "it started making itself and
I started having to go along behind it and write it the way it was"--though not
explicitly stated, Whalen is referring here to a shift in terms of
time-relation with respect to the poem. Though he didn't care much for Spicer,
as a person or a poet, what Whalen seems to be describing is the "dictated
poem." Or, more significantly, it suggests what he got from Gertrude Stein--a
great, early hero to him as well as friend & fellow poet Lew Welch. Stein, in
certain of her work, writes out of a continuous present, and one could say of
much of her work that it, too, is a kind of "continuous nerve movie."
(Certainly that's true of "Tender Buttons.") Writing you follow, not that
follows you.

This, by the way, is maybe what Coolidge got from Whalen and/or Stein--his
work, certain of it, does seem to exist in a continuous present, for instance
this, from his meditation on Drurer:

The world a height now brine, estuaries drained to the very pole.
Geometrics, a lingual dent? Drainage, albany. Where at the last
stand all this sphere that herded me? My cell a corner on the
filtering world, all out there herein my belts. Things in trim they
belt me, beg me, array my coined veils. Brass, copse of my trends
to needles never suffered their pricks. The world in anger
is an angled hole? Drop my pliers, sit hemmed in, which have made
has clad me in. Meld thought is as droop. [...]

It doesn't "resemble" Whalen on first take, but, thought about, after having
read much of both poets, an essential connection begins to seem more than
plausible.

But back to Berrigan & Whalen. This poem, written from 1963-1965--Berrigan or
Whalen?:

MY SONGS INDUCE PROPHETIC DREAMS

*

It's very hard to work when I'm hungry and it doesn't seem
likely that I shall have anything to eat today ... some time
next week, yes. I have a tentative dinner invitation
for Monday ... but that's merely possible
it's just as probable that I
shall receive $10,000 in the mail on Monday morning. [...]

Well, a real Berrigan fan will know he rarely used "shall," but other than
that, the resemblance, I think, is remarkable. Another shot of Whalen, at
random (from 1962):

THE SATURDAY VISITATIONS

1.

That was the end of the Roman Empire
Which ought to have lasted

2.

ALL PEOPLE

try to tell
us/we may sue

Very tiring.
*
FORGET IT
*

I could go on, quote more of Whalen, even drag in specific turns of phrase &
images later filched by Berrigan, but it's too easy, and unneccessary for
anyone who can get their hands on _On Bears Head_.

I don't mean to diminish Berrigan by this post; I mean merely to give Whalen
his due. He's someone who definitely deserves a festschrift, as well as an
in-print collected. I doubt he'll live to see either.

Yours,

I believe that he is Austrian and based in Vienna. He is much disliked by
the local burghers who believe that he interrupts the profitable flow of
consumers into their stores. He also constructs long strings of poems and
ties them on strings that are strung between lampposts.

Local  radio stations ask is this art?

Thread on publishing, etc.

I went to a small press publishing thing at Beyond Baroque not too long ago.
As opposed to Paul V. of RIBOT, most of the publishers there could not
describe "what they like" at all:  their publications were really outgrowths
of their own taste, largely informed by the way they read their own writing.
Had no way to communicate how they decided on content.  A poetic?  Frankly,
it's like trying to decide on a B&B based on the description alone.  Half the
"cozy Victorian cottages" aren't anything but an older non-victorian house
with a bunch of brown furniture.

As someone who has spent years trying to psyche out editorial whim based on
reading a journal:  it's about 50-50 as far as actually being able to
ascertain decision making from the result.  In my experience, when I submit
stuff, either its rejected or the editor takes it and asks for more.

Hi, Joel:

I'd go even further here & suggest that Berrigan's class background, & constant
later-life poverty, in some part explain his constant "thieving"--he borrowed
&/or stole lines, images, points of view, moves, etc., the way he stole books &
food, & borrowed money. I mean, it was what he did to survive. Anyway, I wrote
about just this subject for Artpaper (a now-defunct Minneapolis arts journal)

If you are near a university library, try to track down the latest issue
(winter 97, I think, number 38.4) of the academic journal _Contemporary
Literature_.  It contains an excellent and fairly lengthy (31 pages)
article by Libbie Rifkin entitled "'Worrying about Making It'": Ted
Berrigan's Social Poetics."  The essay illuminates a wide range of topics,
including T.B.'s relationships with Ashbery and O'Hara and his editing of
the magazine _"C"_.  The focus is on how, for all their grungeiness, The
Sonnets hitch their candour to a prospective stake in their future
reception.

One of my favourite Berrigan artifacts is the recording of him reading "Red
Shift" on the CD included with the _Exact Change Yearbook_.  I don't have a
printed copy of the poem, so this will be inaccurately rendered, but I gasp
and tremble every time I hear his voice's faltering insistence in the
closing passage:

I am only pronouns and I am all of them.
And I didn't ask for this  you did
I came into your life to change it
and it did so
and now nothing will ever change that
And that's that.
             Alone and crowded
unhappy fate.  Nevertheless,
I slip softly into the air.
The world's furious song
flows through my costume.


only pronouns,
David Cuthbert

Worth thinking about O'Hara in this class/Catholic context too, not quite
the same but related it seems to me - having spent years in and around
Worcester, MA its hard to think of a more working class space if there ius
such a thing. The lapsed-Catholic 20th century poet - is that a category?
Interesting.  - Mike (go lapsed catholics!) Magee.

Dear K Lederer:  Today's news seemed so familiar to me.  Then I realized
we had published it in OINK!, New American Writing's precursor, about 1000
years ago.  That was during the era when Ted taught and lived in Chicago--
a good moment.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Gary,

I have a terrific poem that mentions this connection between Whalen and
Berrigan -- but I would suggest that the Whalen of Berrigan's longer poems
(esp. Tambourine Life and Train Ride) is a Schuyler-modified Whalen.

The way I put it in the poem is this:

Philip Whalen if I may go back
To my damaged-lecturer mode is
In Scenes of Life at the Capitol
The link from Ezra Pound to James Schuyler

But you know these things these quotations from poems they don't make any
sense -- why am I being so self-deprecating? is it because my reading of
Berrigan is tinted by my reading of Bernstein? -- so here's what I'll do.
Send me your address, and I'll drop the poem in the mail to you today or
tomorrow.

Take care,
Jordan

All the Berrigan posts have been great, just a few things..
I would be anxious to know at what park Olson and Berrigan talked at in 1963?
I grew up in Buffalo and would like to know!
Joel, I loved your preface to "On the Level Everyday" Why can't someone get
the ball rolling and publish more of his stuff so it can be available to
everyone.
There are some 20 or more titles listed at the beginning of that book, titles
of Berrigan's work alone and stuff with Ron Padgett (by the way that was weird
yesterday  that they were talking about Berrigan in that interview with
Padgett (on NPR), Anne Waldman right when these posts were being read, is that
Jung's Synchronicity?)
It is nice to have something like "On the Level Everyday", we need more
-as far as Raushenberg telling Berrigan he imitates Ashbery, I just don't see
it, sounds like a painter being snotty to a poet for no particular reason?
-Grunge, yes this word did not spring up into the world in 1988, but the mass
of society used that word to talk about music, Mudhoney etc.. By calling
Berrigan grunge I can see what anyone means, but.. that would be like calling
a poet now a hippy.. they are all just labels, grunge being a label I never
liked. To use it to describe dirt or the like is fine though, Berrigan was
gritty..
--I also think the post about class is right on, Berrigan has working class
roots, you can say this doesn't matter, but it does, you can say it didn't
matter when Bethlehem Steel or Trico moved out of Buffalo, but it did, it
affected the psyche of almost the whole city.  Ted I think was really down to
earth, one of the first poets to openly declare poetry as his FULL time
profession-he would say, a doctor doesn't work another job does s/he? so I am
a full time poet!
 Ron, I also understand why it is hard to write about someone you were close
with, to go against their wishes, but in the long run, it would be nice to
have more on Berrigan.
So can anyone tell me where I can get Berrigan's last poems in Arshile: A
Magazine of the Arts, and a copy of "The Sonnets" in case that other lead
doesn't work out o yeah , and I know a student up here in Albany who knows
Edmund, Berrigan's son and says he is a great poet, so look out for him!

Standard's poet is excellent.

It is indeed true: publishing, undertaken in whatever format and thru
whatever kind of effort (one editor doing most of the work, a collective,
a small group of friends) is a very *giving* and productive activity.  If
you publish people whose work you like, and which is therefore like your
own, well that in large part is "your job" as an editor.  (It can be fun
also to include something very unlike yourself, rather like Berrigan
admiring Wilbur....I have done this some and am in the process of doing
more of it;  but I consider a Berrigan/Wilbur involvement to be optional:
I don't think Standard in Rhizome or Lowther in Syntactics (or the folks
at Raddle Moon) are interested in as broad a canvas as I consider Misc.
Proj. to be.  I started it to fulfill a different and more eclectic
mission, thus its greater emphasis on poetics and polemics than some,
despite its  being in the first instance a venue for poetry.)

Anyway, Standard is absolutely right: those blanket submitters who hit
everyone everywhere all the time, are just as "self-promoting" as we who
publish and edit.

And as Standard says, you can do a lot with relatively small resources;
you can really have an impact on people who care about poetry.  You can
really have an impact on the poetry scene. Hereby, a brief list of honor
of the low-budget mags that have been very helpful to me, and were crucial
in encouraging Misc. Proj. (with their editors)

Compound Eye (Ange Mlinko)
Situation (Mark Wallace)
Lower Limit Speech (Aldon Nielsen)

Let a thousand mags exfoliate...

I am saddened by the news of Ronald Johnson's death.
His long poem  RADI  OS (Sand Dollar, 1977) is a volume I've returned to with
renewed  pleasure for the last twenty years.  RADI  OS was composed by making
erasures in a 1892 edition of PARADISE LOST--an extraordinary example of found
art.
In addition to a large and moving body of literary work Mr. Johnson was an
accomplished chef and wrote several wonderful cookbooks.
He'll be missed.

All the wonderful scoop on Ted Berrigan -- I had not thought he would be
ignored by critics or readers, and he doesn't seem to be ignored by the
people on this list.  In terms of class, ethnicity, etc., has
anyone examined the Tulsa tie between Ted, Padgett, Joe Brainard, Dick
Gallup, others?  I'm not sure Tulsa has ever produced so many remarkable
writers.  I'm not sure it's so bad to called a disciple of Frank O'Hara
(or of Ted Berrigan), whatever "disciple" means.  No matter what, it
makes for a great first line from a Berrigan poem:

I'm a disciple of Frank O'Hara

Anyone care to write the next line?

i see you are choosing to ignore my last wherein i'd reputedly said i'd
rather have no bio than the one you show and i made some other feeble
attempt today
nobody knows billy little, they say he lives in Nowhere, B.C., he could be
writing poems in your name next week.  Combat Plagiarism is a project he's
currently working on wherein he writes the best poem he could possibly
write that day and signs your name or Gerry Gilbert's name(he certainly
deserves a page at the EPC), or Pierre Joris or Lily Brik or Duncan
McNaughton or David McFadden. and everytime i see a used first edition by
ted berrigan i sign the inside flyleaf "with the deepest regard ted good
pills," ted berrigan and jack micheline were both slaves of dionysos, at
one point ted berrigan could have said i never met a pill i didn't like,
the gay circles were also into the pharmaceuticals, tho i can't say about
ohara
ted died of too many coca colas,
he was a true new yorker,
ted was more of an innovator
ohara more traditional from the french
frank laconic ted frantic
frank was champagney like pasternak
ted more electric cool aid like mayakofski
 he saw through things
and enacted the simple conclusions,
in reference to Charles Olson's death he said,
90% of the people who die of cancer deserve it
Ted took Zukofsky's translation methods to the street
 the ohara affinities arise in the bebop not the beat
if you're writing about the influences on poetry especially of Berrigan's
generation you have to factor in the drugs, especially acid and mescaline,
i'd like to hear Creeley chime in on this aspect, Ted certainly helped Bob
see the light on numerous occasions, in more ways than poetry. Or anselm
are you lurking? The collage element of the sonnets seemed a form of
translation few practice from english to english an ur hypertext a wink
ideally you'd try the drug to help you understand the poem more fully. with
lowell likewise you'd have to talk about or take tranquilizers and lots of
aspirin, that'd be a great anthology, poets of the headache, aspirin
defines an era like heroin defines the next and bennies and coffee and amyl
nitrate and cherry coke if you can't take the drug don't do the crime John
Weiners are you lurking,shooting email niterate, is somebody doing your
page right this minute, you could tell us lots about all of this, Olson
said if he were starting over he'd rather write like Weiners or Baraka or
Sanders. Weiners said he hoped to be the Baraka of the gay struggle. I
surely hope someone is mining those fragile memories of johns even if he
gets it wrong its only a wrong among a plethora of wrongs and his wrong
will have more verve more frisson than two or three rites, me i'm one of
those students of Duncan's who would rather err on the side of beauty..

Berrigan has two wonderful sons who write--Eddie and Anselm--

Eddie (who lives in SF) has two terrific chapbooks out on Idiom Press:
1143 Hearst Ave., Berkeley, CA 94702 (Idiom also has chapbooks out by
Renee Gladman, Greg Biglieri--and has some forthcoming by myself, Lauren
Gudath, and many other great emerging writers--). The books are lovely to
look at and to read--

Eddie has also had work recently in Arshile, ZYZZYVA, Explosive, and
Gas.... He does his own journal, LOG--

Anselm has a chapbook out on Gas (I think it's sold out now...), and new
work in Situation, Explosive, No Trees, BOOGLIT Mag., Mass Ave., and
elsewhere. He currently lives in NYC--

He will have a full-length collection coming out this year on Rod Smith's
EDGE Books--it is wonderful, and you should all take a look--

***

I have always found these two writers interesting in terms of the writing
practices of their father (and mother, Alice Notley)--they allow one to
think of poetry as a true profession--in the noble sense--one that can be
handed down--one that can be passed along through the generations--

Eddie and Alice wrote about a million collaborations when Eddie was
little. I don't want to embarass Eddie, but they are so great to
read--very refreshing--

Eddie was 8 or 9 when he wrote these with Alice:

POEM

Ignominy, obscurity, and serenity
hurl a pearl at the floor:

"No presuppositions of fame after death"
"No legal fees"

In these parts we smoke our dinner
"No pepper games"

we eat with our feet
and we walk with our hands

THERE'S A SIGN ON THE THIRD FLOOR
THAT SAYS SO

we groom ourselves like cats
and we end our poems like lives

THOUGHT BALLOON

The cloud is green
My head is empty
It is spring
Inside this penny
I meet Jenny
And kid.

THE BEAST OF EACH

One night in America
I hugged my beast
The beast of each
The beast was bleached
And beautiful as a scarecrow
But scared though.

I love him plenty
Though we have no money
He's my beast
The beast of each

***

I love these.....

At two recent Explosive benefit readings I've had the pleasure of
witnessing readings by Brecht Gander (of Forrest and CD Wright--wonderful,
all the workshoppers were very jealous...), and Danny Morice (of Dave
Morice--incredible, terrific poem)--

I think that this sort of activity is on some level the best thing that
can come out of poetry--

All best,
Katy

I am also shocked and saddened by this news.
Sun & Moon is publishing a complete version of
RADI OS/THE OUTTAKES. It will be published
in early 1999.

Ron was a truly great poet, as his ARK reveals.

Tulsa's a fascinating little artistic secret - Oklahoma in general really
- isn't Cornel West a Tulsan? and if you include Okla City you get Ralph
Ellison and avant-garde trumpeter Don Cherry.  -m.

Some years ago, introducing Kenneth Koch at a Paris reading, I suggested
that the "New York School" should (retroactively) be renamed the "Tulsa"
school -- KK nearly lost his usual sunny composure.
& on the left wall of my study, slightly back of the chair I'm sitting on,
hangs a 5 by 3  painting of Ted done by Mary Beach.

Another poeta Ted was forever studying was Auden. Sometime in the middle
seventies I asked him why he still bothered with that mannered Brit
cocktail-chatter & he said something like: "Becaus he's got the biggest bag
of cheap tricks — and as a poet you need to know all the cheap tricks of
the trade."

Several new Berrigan books have been published recently or are in the works:

Situations has published "Great Stories of the Chair" a group of poems
first printed in Angel Hair in the late sixties and not collected
elsewhere. Available from St. Mark's Poetry Project, SPD and Bridge Street
Books (for $6) perhaps elsewhere-Out-of-print at the publisher-grab while
you can.

Alice Notley has just written me that Penguin has contracted to do a new
edition of "The Sonnets"-no publication date announced as of yet. [That
makes four editions: "C", Grove, United Artists & Penguin.]

Granary Books published "In the Nam What Can Happen" by Ted Berrigan and
George Schneeman-this is a simulation of an artists' book made in
collaboration by these two about 1968. Beautifully produced in an edition
of 70 (50 for sale at $500).

Granary also has in the works "Ted Berrigan: An Annotated Checklist" by
Aaron Fischer. This book chronicles Ted's life in print and is much more
than a mere checklist as it is filled with accounts of publishing the
books. Also included are 27 never-seen-before Berrigan/Schneeman
collaborations from the late sixties (some in full color) and a fine
introduction "Publishing Ted" by Lewis Warsh. This book is nearly ready to
go to the printer. I'll make a formal announcement to the list upon
publication in a couple of months. It'll be priced around $35, give or take.

Regarding the show at the NYPL: A Secret Location on the Lower East Side:
Adventures in Writing 1960-1980-indeed Mr. Berrigan would seem to be the
presiding spirit looking out, as he does from the painting by Mr.
Schneeman, over a vast sea of poetry books. We are currently finishing work
on a 350 pp fully illustrated book documenting the era as well as the
show-co-published by Granary and the NYPL and due out around June 1, 98.
I'll announce upon publication.

I'd be happy to back channel a several paragraph description of the exhibit
to anyone interested. Contact me (Dear Chris, hello=8A)

Go ahead and set yourself up as Berrigan's Defender.  I never labelled
anybody.  I said Berrigan combined art and life, formality & informality,
by letting the GRUNGE of street life seep into his work, the gritty,
GRUNGY street-life of Providence, Worcester, New York, Tulsa, wherever
it may be found (it's even in Minneapolis).  I don't think Berrigan would
disagree, myself.  I find GRUNGY to be a fine evocative word for the
GRUNGE I am talking about.

I always liked the generosity in Berrigan's writing, (though there's a
memoir/ letter in, I think, _Nice to See You_ in which TB drives up to
Chicago from Iowa City to read w/ (correct me if I'm wrong, someone) Ann
Sexton.  He didn't seem to care much for her or her work in this letter.
=09My favorite example comes from the book Joel Lewis edited, _On the
Level Everyday_, where Berrigan is talking about how poets support
themselves, and he says of Wallace Stevens (not exactly working class, not
exactly bohemian) that "It's bad karma to work at a job fulltime and not
go at it as seriously as you go at being a poet. Wallace Stevens,
incidently, was not just an insurance man; he was vice-president of the
Hartford Casualty Company. I mean there's no sense fooling around; if
you're going to do something, you might as well be good at it" (57).=20
=09re: Auden: there's a great story in Sanders' _Tales of Beatnik
Glory_ about a young lowereastsider who practices forging Auden's
autograph, then goes to palm off an "autograph copy to a dealer." The
great twist occurs when ol' Wystan himself walks in.  The story is written
w/ a degree of fondness that makes me think that Berrigan wasn't alone
among the new yorkers who dug (aspects of) Auden.

Much saddened by the news of Ronald Johnson's death. Besides reading in RA DIOS
tonight, I will also celebrate the man by cooking something from his THE AMERICAN
TABLE --probably the HAM AND EGGPLANT PILAU MADAME BEGUE, &, if there's time,
make his incredible Kentucky Pie. My copy of The American Table is falling to
pieces -- when will someone reprint this one & his Southwestern Cooking Old &
New.

good point. but: there have always been poets limited for one reason or
another, who have still managed to get published. and poetry (obviously) is
not always verbal-- doesn't have to be / need to be. and while i'm sure it's
nice to have the ease of web publishing, there are other ways, and these
ways should not be forgotten.
as far as "egoless" poetry... poetry will always have a writer. even if the
poet tries to write without ego, it is still s/he trying to be egoless. and
perhaps the ego is bigger in it's attempt ((i.e. i feel (the person) jackson
mac low more strongly in his unintentional texts, than in his intentional.
meaning: the ego it takes to think up "unintentional" leaves it's mark)).
i think a lot of people are misunderstanding my meaning:
i am not "anti-web". i can just see that a world without the written or
spoken word is a sad one. and i have seen a lot of people disappear into
their computers in the last few years. they have forsaken tactile, vistual,
audible, etc. world in favor of the stagnation of the same form, the
computer. i understand the computer is a valuable tool (here i am, aren't
i), but people are allowing it to become their life.
and i think: when the experience of life disappears, so shall art. this
upsets me.

So would I! Betcha Delaware; they could have walked there from the
University pretty easily [as a freshman or sophomore then, I don't
remember]. Where did you live in Bflo? I grew up in So. Buffalo, near
Cazenovia [another Olmstead baby] & the small Seneca Indian Park [where
Red Jacket lay before his move to Forest Lawn, adjacent to Delaware
Park]. Creeley would probably know. Let us all know if you find out!

butit's easy to loose people who may not know better (and perhaps some that
do) in the conotations of the word. for me: i've been involved with the punk
rock scene most of my life. for years grunge punk bands where the butt of
many of jokes, and never taken seriously (this all before they got huge).
so: when someone uses the word grunge, my first reaction is to think of a
person who is trying to hard to be something -- contriving, and in need of a
bath.
i realize that this is a stereotype, but it is my first reaction to the
word, and thus my thoughts will be tainted by this initial reaction.
and so on...

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Some thoughts on the Berrigan thread, which I'm enjoying:

The question of whether Berrigan is or isn't Frank O'Hara's "disciple" (or
anyone else's) is ultimately less interesting than how, why, and where he
resembles, echoes, and uses his predecessors.  What does he do with what
he learns from or gains from O'Hara, Ashbery, Whalen, etc?  How and why do
their styles and even their words appear in or spur his own poems?

What got me thinking about this specifically were a couple of interesting
echoes/allusions in the poem Katy Lederer quoted yesterday, I USED TO BE
BUT NOW I AM.

When Berrigan begins the poem:
  I used to be inexorable,
  But now I am elusive.
it reminded me of O'Hara speaking of what he wants he wants from his
poetry in the early poem "Poetry":
  All this I desire.  To
  deepen you by my quickness ...
  as if you would never leave me
  and were the inexorable
  product of my own time.
How is Berrigan's allusion to O'Hara's poem functioning here?  Is he
revealing an earlier desire to be O'Hara-like, perhaps, that has now given
way to wanting to be more "elusive"?

When Berrigan goes on:
  I used to be the future of America,
  But now I am America.
it's hard not to think of Ginsberg's "America": "it occurs to me that
I am America."

Also, when Berrigan writes:
  I used to be part of the solution, if not all of it,
  But now I am not that person.
He again seems to deliberately echo O'Hara, particularly the last line of
"How to Get There":

"and we drift into the clear sky enthralled by our disappointment
        never to be alone again
                                never to be loved
sailing through space: didn't I have you once for my self?
                                                    West Side?
        for a couple of hours, but I am not that person"

Again, Berrigan picks up a line from O'Hara, puts it in a new context,
builds on it, etc.  The whole poem's structure -- "I used to be ... now I
am ..." -- suggests that perhaps the poem is ABOUT negotiating with
earlier influences, earlier selves ("I used to be but now .. I am not that
person"). Paying attention to the echoes can open the poem in interesting
ways ..

 So rather than dismissing comments about Berrigan's debt to O'Hara as
wholly unfair, maybe we, as readers or TB, need to think
about HOW he is reading and using O'Hara, Ashbery, Whalen, Ginsberg,
Creeley (didn't the poem "Words For Love" come from the titles of
the two Creeley books on Berrigan's desk?), specifically.  It seems to me
like he engages in an ongoing _conversation_ with poets like O'Hara that
is really fascinating.  (And the post that connected his fondness for
allusion and appropriation to literal theft was a really neat idea
worth considering ...)

I also wanted to strongly second the recording of "Red Shift" on that
Exact Change Yearbook CD.  I've never heard a poem read aloud in a more
powerful or moving way than that one.  (Hint: I checked the Exact Change
book out of the library and taped the CD and returned it).

"I am 43.  When will I die?  I will never die.  I will live
To be 110 & I will never go away, & you will never escape from me
        who am always & only a ghost, despite this frame...."
("Red Shift")

Subject:      Theresa Hak Kyung Cha 'n Berrigan 'n Consc. Objectors

Does anyone know where one (me) can get hold of any of Cha's work in
film / video? I'm "doing" *Dictee* in my (borrowing Maria's great term
for now) "Weird Books by Women" course, but never have seen any of her
visual work except in reproduced stills or the visual / text piece in
*Premonitions*. I'd also be interested to hear--b/c or on the list,
either way--whether there was any interaction between Cha and Bay Area
langpo's while she was living out there. Ron, or anyone?

In my role as resident reference-nerd: a bit of recent academic
attention to Berrigan can be found in Libbie Rifkin's essay "Worrying
about Making It': Ted Berrigan's Social Poetics," Contemporary
Literature 38.4 (winter 1997): 640-672. Part of her Cornell diss., which
also has some real good stuff on Olson and Creeley.

Joel Kuszai--backchannel me and I might be able to give you a lead re
the conscientious objectors movement (in WWII, anyway, and Lowell,
Everson, and Stafford's relation to it).

Ace conference down home here in Louavull this past weekend: much
fruitful provocation stirred up by Cary Nelson, Eavan Boland somewhere
between serious historical engagement and marketable nostalgia depending
on whose p-o-v you listen to, Harryette Mullen serving up a spectacular
run through the whole of *Muse and Drudge*, non-stop. Some of you were
here; the rest of you should have been. Well, next year in Jerusalem.

                                New obstacles for exchange arise

                                Or unfold, O ye postmasters!



1. About the Poetics List


The Poetics List was founded in late 1993 with the epigraph above.


There are presently almost 600 subscribers.


Please note that this is a private list and information about the list
should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is
to keep the list to those with specific rather than general interests,
and also to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume
manageable.


The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While
individual posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we
continue to work to promote the editorial function of this project. The
definition of that project, while provisional, and while open to
continual redefinition by list participants, is nonetheless aversive to a
generalized discussion of poetry. Rather, our aim is  to support, inform,
and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
**<color><param>ffff,0000,0000</param>We also encourage subscribers to
post information on publications and reading series that they have
coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear (see section 9
below).** (THIS MEANS *YOU*).

</color>

Please keep in mind that all posts go out immediately to all subscribers,
and become part of an on-line archive. *<italic>Posting to Poetics is a
form of publication, not personal communication</italic>.* Participants
are asked to exercise caution before posting messages! While spontaneity
of response may seem the very heart of the list at its best, it also has
the darker side of circulating ideas that have not been well considered
(or considered by another reader -- editor or friend). Given the nature
of the medium, subscribers do well to maintain some skepticism when
reading the list and, where possible, to try to avoid taking what may be
something close to a spontaneous comment made in the heat of exchange as
if it were a revised or edited essay ("Let the Reader Beware!").=20


The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein. Joel Kuszai is list
manager.  For subscription information contact us at
POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu.


___________________________________________________________


2. Subscriptions


Subscriptions to Poetics are free of charge. But we ask that you
subscribe with your real name and we reserve the right to request
additional information, including address and phone number. All
subscription information you supply will remain confidential.


You can subscribe (sub) or unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line
message, with no subject line, to:


listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu


the one-line message should say:


unsub poetics


{or}


sub poetics Jill Jillway


(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your

name to unsub)


We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity. Please allow
several days for your new or re-subscription to take effect.=20


*


If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:


Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use
Eudora (an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites):
from the Tools menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending
Mail": you may be able to substitute your old address here and send the
unsub message.


The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages
may get bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned
to us. If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an
increase from your system administrator. (You may wish to argue that this
subscription is part of your scholarly communication!) You may also wish
to consider obtaining a commercial account.


In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your account, your
subscription to Poetics will be temporarily suspended. If this happens,
simply resubscribe to the list in the normal manner, once your account
problem has been resolved.


All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to the list's
administrative address: poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu. Please note that it may
take up to ten days, or more, for us to reply to messages.=20

____________________________________________________________________


3.  Cautions


Please do not post to the list personal or backchannel correspondence, or
other unpublished material, without the express permission of the author.
Copyright for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author;
material from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".


The Poetics List has a 50 message daily limit. If more than 50 messages
are received, the listserver will automatically hold those additional
messages until the list is manually unlocked, usually the following day.
While it is difficult to prescribe a set limit on the number of daily,
weekly, or monthly posts for any  subscriber, please keep this limit in
mind. If you plan to respond to multiple threads, it is generally
preferable to consolidate your reply into one message. While relevant
excerpts from a post to which you are responding may usefully be appended
to your reply, please do not include in your new post the whole text of a
long previously posted message.


Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a
post, since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via
"digest" or who cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.=20


In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also
become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry events
and publications are always welcome. (See section 7.)


Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.


If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or
supply information missing from an post, or thank someone for posting
something you requested, please send the request or comment to the
individual backchannel, not to the whole list.=20


____________________________________________________________________


4. Digest Option


The Listserve program gives you he option to receive all the posted
Poetics message each day as a single message. If you would prefer to
receive ONE message each day, which would include all messages posted to
the list for that day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line
message (no subject line) to


                                listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu


set poetics digest


NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply

to this message!!


You can switch back to individual messages by sending this message:


set poetics mail

____________________________________________________________________


5. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail


Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be
away for any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and
you may lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can
temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by sending a message to
"listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu"


set poetics nomail


& turn it on again with: set poetics mail


When you return you can check or download missed postings from the
Poetics

archive. (See 8 below.)


____________________________________________________________________


6. Who's Subscribed


To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the
e-mail message blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:


  review poetics


You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail) a
rather long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics
subscribers.  This list is alphabetized by server not name.


 or try:


 review POETICS by name

 review POETICS by country


which will give you the list alphabetically by name or a flawed list by
country (since all ".com" and ".net"s are counted as US)


*Please do not send a message to the list asking for the address of a
specific subscriber.*

____________________________________________________________________


7. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?


our URL is


http://writing.upenn.edu/epc


The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to
serve as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity in
formally innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The
Center provides access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources
in the new poetries including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals,
the POETICS List archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts,
and direct connections to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The
Center also provides information about contemporary print little
magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics. And we have an
extensive collection of soundfiles of poets' reading their work, as well
as the archive of LINEbreak, the radio interview series.


The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

____________________________________________________________________


8. Poetics Archives via EPC


Go to the EPC and select Poetics from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. You may browse the archives by month and year
or search them for specific information. Your interface will allow you to
print or download any of these files.


Or set your browser to go directly to:

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/archive


____________________________________________________________________


9. Publishers & Editors Read This!


PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is
open and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed
publications as easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to
participate! Send a list of your press/publications to
glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu with the words EPC Press Listing in the subject
line. You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word
processing program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail message to the
address above to obtain a mailing address to which to send your disk.
Though files marked up with html are our goal, ascii files are perfectly
acceptable. If yourword processor ill save files in Rich Text Format
(.rtf) this is also highly desirable


Send us extended information on new publications (including any back
cover copy and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists
(including excerpts from reviews, sample poems, etc.).  Be sure to
include full information for ordering--including prices and addresses and
phone numbers both of the press and any distributors.


Initially, you might want to send short anouncements of new publications
directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check
the EPC; in your message please include full information for ordering.=20
If you have a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention that in any
Poetics posts.


Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have received a
noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to promote your
publication and we are glad to facilitate information about interesting
publications.

I think this must be the strangest thing I've read on this list since
Ron Silliman said he had enjoyed the cinematic _English Patient_.

But (as a contrarian) I love this stuff--even though I don't think I've
ever liked a Richard Wilbur poem.  I wish Ted Berrigan were here so I
could ask him _which_ poem.  Wouldn't that be a lot more fun than
endlessly toeing some rigid aesthetic line?

This makes perfect sense to me.  Have never understood why it's okay and
playful and camp to learn from (and use) BAD movies, BAD music, etc.,
but not (what some people may think is) BAD poetry.  Why be so
straitlaced?  Shouldn't a poet be more like a magpie?

This is a good point.  The whole dippy argument is a clash of generations.
It's good for you to learn that "grungy" is a real word to some people who
know & care little about the alternative rock scene important to their
kids' generation.  It's good for me to learn the limitations of my own
historical perspective.  But I also believe that, with regard to the
example you give, EVERYONE is deeply involved in grunge.  Because we
are ALL TRYING HARD TO BE SOMETHING and we all NEED A BATH.  - Henry Gould

I'm coming in on this "girder" exchange late, and I happen to be very tired
at the moment, so this is just to sort of hold my place for a while
because listmemory is so short.  I think you--David--are wrong about the Rez
image being in bad faith. But it wld be difficult to explain why, & i just
can't go into it right now.  We'd have to start with the fact, tho, that the
line that is being quoted is not what what Rez wrote, but what Oppen
remembered.  To note the difference doesn't do much to explicate my case,
since what Rez wrote was
"rubbish," not "rubble."  But we shld at least start from the right
place.  More later.  Steve

  Oh, sure Rachel, it's just that I never had a taste for Auden, there's a fair
amount of other BAD poetry I don't mind or in fact enjoy using, though finally I
rather steal lines form ted than from doubleyou aitch.

agree with just about everything you write here / sure, lots lost in
e-communication / but obviously also lots gained / i'm more connected,
definitely, now than i was a couple years ago before taking the e-plunge /
and several real-virtual relationships have lead to (or at least hastened
the development of, assuming we probably would've met down the line)
several virtual-real ones, not to mention sustaining, extending initial
how-d-do's at conferences etc. which otherwise, probably, would have
fizzled / so yeah, i both know and know of more people now with the help of
email -- pleased to meet ya / and gosh, i think we're still communicating
(somewhat communicating?) here, even tho you can't smell my aftershave / to
you i can only be "a collection of electronic words"? / i've been less on
worse days

I've enjoyed reading posts about Ted Berrigan by Erik, Simon Schuchat,
Jordan Davis, Henry Gould and others. In 1967 I attended Ted's workshop at
the Poetry Project. Some years later, as he did with many others,Ted gave
me some very much appreciated support,including recommending some poems of
mine to Simon Schuchat and Eileen Myles who were publishing mimeo magazines
in the early to middle 70's.(By the way, Ted confided in me that he was
particularly impressed by Mr. Schuchat's" brilliance" and writing
talents).I had heard Ted read a few times before attending his workshop and
had been deeply impressed and truly excited by his poetry and his manner of
reading. Ted's readings had a special combination of humor, sincerity,
affection, spontaneity and sheer poetic intensity and beauty which have
been rarely equalled in contemporary poetry. Ted put great emphasis on the
importance of giving poetry readings in the career of a poet. In his own
way, he was a great actor. As a teacher, a reader, and a mentor he gave of
himself completely. Hardly a week or two goes by in my life when I do not
think about him. I go back to his work constantly and keep discovering new
things. His work and his person were unforgettably inspiring.Something
about his person and his approach to poetry made a great many people
excited about poetry in an unusual way, perhaps because of his way of
sharing his special passion and devotion to the art, perhaps because of his
way of emanating and encouraging more joy and pleasure in writing and
living. It is possible that later in life he paid a price for adamantly
refusing to take himself, writing- or anything-  seriously to the point of
eliminating any possible generosity, warmth, joy and spontaneity. Perhaps
he was an example of a "60's casualty", something Charles Bernstein long
ago pointed out as a cautionary tale, though I don't like to think about
this too much. I think I agree with Henry Gould in what he seemed to be
saying about Berrigan's combining of the quotidian with high art.
Berrigan's irrepressible passion for life made all passions seem more
possible and more necessary. I cannot look at an exclamation point without
thinking of him!

Here are a few lines from a poem by Carter Ratcliff published in 1969 in
"The World Anthology" edited by Anne Waldman:

        THINGS TO DO IN TED BERRIGAN'S WORKSHOP

        Arrive at eight-thirty
        Arrive early when the table is strewn with banners all strewn with
                table-shaped stars....
        Notice who was there all the time
        Read things on the wall
        Dismiss this project immediately
        Concentrate on the poem being read....
        Say that a a poem is great because the poet speaks of important things
                in his own voice....
        Disagree with anything anybody else says,especially what Charles, Ted,
                Nick and Scott say
        Agree with everything anybody says....
        Be jealous of everybody
        Approve of this sentiment and its intensity....

                                *

Hope to hear more from others about Ted Berrigan.

from my conversations with alice notley, their appears to be little left in
manuscripts of ted's for publication--although if some ambitious grad
students would haunt collections w/ mineo books, they'd probably find
plenty of uncollected ted. geoff young was intersted in publishing waiting
for chris --but i understand that the manuscript is missing parts.

yes, ted loved richard wilbur & lot of folks that this list would consider
cornballs. he loved lowell's "To Speak of the Woe that is in marriage" and
once recited Joyce Kilmer (& not Trees) when someone put down one of
jersey's bards.
i guess i learned to be open to all sorts of stuff -- ted dug the langyage
poets & i even remeber a manuscript homasge to bruce andrew's Film Noir
that seems to have never seen print

i wish there was some official issue of ted on tape -- there is a complete
raeing ofthe sonnets at langton street & tons of stuff at the po project.
what still comes thru in the poems is the intense devotion to "poetry" not
craft or poetics. like a rock musician playing an out of the way gig -- he
did one of my poorly paying gigs in jersey, as it gave him a chance to test
out new material he would be reading in nyc the next week w/ old pal
padgett.

also some more attention must be paid to great writers like mauren ownen,
bob rosenthal, john godfrey, yuki hartman, tony towle, jim brodey, bill
berkson, ted greenwald and others of that era

and where is regina beck? --last heard: a lubavitch chasid

Thank you for saying this! I have had the opportunity this year to be
editor-in-chief for Fourteen Hills: The SFSU Review, a literary magazine
funded by San Francisco State University. I would like to acknowledge
the funding openly: without it the magazine would be dead. But we get
about 500 submissions an issue. If every submitter sent $5 for a sample
copy, the magazine would get $2500--almost the cost of printing--easily
ensuring the survival. (And they would also understand the caliber of
work we publish.)
Now of course I understand that writers cannot afford to send $5 with
every submission--but I have certainly become more aware of the plight
of magazines and I'm left asking:

why do writers want magazines to publish their work (support them) if
they aren't willing to support the magazine?

Or maybe what you meant that the writers published in the magazine
should pay...self-promotion...publish themselves...as an editor I don't
consider work with a check attached any more or less than one without,
and I wouldn't want any other magazine to do the same with me.

Ready for the fire,
Karen McKevitt

Awhile ago Tom Beckett mentioned Alan Davies's chapbook from hole books,
and I think he wondered whether it was still available. There are five
copies of Alan's chapbook available. Each one has been hand-made; cover is
from a linocut.

Here's the list of available chapbooks from hole:

Alan Davies, Sei Shonagon     $5
Clint Burnham, Pandemonium    $5
Deanna Ferguson, ddilemma     $5

You can email Rob Manery at geschwitz@intergate.bc.ca if interested.

Forthcoming this summer, chapbooks from:

Jackson Mac Low

I think I hear people griping that Ted Berrigan is not on the silly-bus of
university English courses.

Dont sweat it.

You dont very often learn about what's been happening on course lists. You
do what we all do--read what the profs got us to read, and then spend MORE
time reading the good stuff. People who want to know what's happened will
read Berrigan, and Hollo, and Padgett. Padgett is a terrific poet, and if I
were to say that someone was the best in something i would maybe nominate
him as the best poet in the USA, but I dont do such things. Suffice it to
say that Ron Padgett is the David McFadden of the USA.

To Henry Gould's question below,

One reason why I think there's been so little critical discussion to date of
>Ted Berrigan is that he was such a strong personality and would have so
>obviously disapproved of such, that people who actually knew the man feel

Didn't the Language Poets disapprove of him?  That might be another reason.
>
I think that quite the opposite is the case. When Ted came to the Bay Area,
he would sometimes stay with Alan Bernheimer or I believe Kit Robinson. Tom
Mandel & I had Ted read at our series at the Grand Piano -- with George
Stanley. It drew 110 people as I recall (I'm always counting audiences),
divided almost equally between those whom had never heard of Ted and those
whom had never heard of George.

Actually, an event (or interlinkage of events) related to that evening may
suggest what filters down to someone like Henry, perceptive, well-read, but
at a distance at least from the SF scene of the 70s, as a sense of
"disapproval" or whatever.

After the reading at the Piano, there were not one but two parties, one for
George in from BC held nearby on the other side of the Panhandle, and a
second one for Ted which, as I remember, was somewhere South of Market (a
few miles away). As co-host I spent some time at each. At the one for Ted's
several of his young ephebes, particularly of the bent then known as
Actualists, were telling him how great his reading was (both were fabulous
that night) by way of telling him how much better he was than George. That
sort of contestatory tone was constant with those guys. Nolan, Gray, Kratz,
Nisbet were just a few of the folks standing around.

But it was Ted who shut that nonsense down instantly. "George Stanley's a
great poet. Didn't you hear that reading!" he responded. None of them
replied although I've always thought that the correct answer to that must
have been, no, they hadn't. Listening was never what they were about.

I've never figured out where that disjunction between those generations came
from, why Ted would listen and hear and these other folks wouldn't and
somehow presumed (wrongly, as it proved here) that he had given them
permission for that behavior.

I think that somewhere disapproval for that behavior by those other guys got
(gets?) translated into some sense that Ted is still being blamed, wrongly,
for it. But actually all the so-called langpos I know always were fond and
close readers of Ted Berrigan. And still are.

May be way of track but came across someone who's history has parallels
with Whalen's.  By chance I came across M. P. Follett's _Creative Experience_
He seems to have been a popular social critic early in the century.  I have
never seen his name and haven't found any lines of thought leading to him
or coming from him.  He appears to be one of those byways of thought that
are in danger of disappearing completely from print, cultural ruts, and
soon even libraries.  We have a fairly well-read group here.  Anyone ever
heard of him?  The quote below is curiously prescient of current
computer/chaos theory discourse.

Being at a distance from those events myself (I think I had a little
league baseball game in Galesburg, Illinois, the night Berrigan & George
Stanley read in SF), I can still put a finger on one source for the
impression of disapproval. Specifically, I remember a line in Tom Clark's
memoir about Berrigan in which he says something to the effect that "Ted
was given a hard time by the language poets" during his last (or one of
his last swings through San Francisco).  Not bringing this up so we can
debate Tom Clark's ethics again, nor to dispute Ron Silliman's account of
events: merely to point out where I (for one) got the impression that some
of the poets associated w/ L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E were not big fans of Berrigan.

hi alan, uc berkeley's art museum has the Cha archives, it might be worth a
trip out there to research it and set up viewing sessions etc. i've never
seen any of her video stuff except in stills myself; there're a coupla
mentions and a photo in Lucy Lippard's book Mixed Blessings. i teach cha in
that course; some students adore it; some "can't follow the story."  do
check out walter lew's exquisite Excerpts from Dikte for Dictee (or
something like that) a "critical collage" responding to cha's book.

Here's the full extent of Tom Clark's remarks on this issue in the memoir
Dave mentions [LATE RETURNS]:  "The final year of his life, though, I was
in contact with him only by mail and telephone.  I heard from friends about
a visit of his to San Francisco, where he had been given a hard time by some
language-poets."

That's it - not much to go on there.  Clark is probably referring to Berrigan's
residency in 1981 at 80 Langton St for a few days. This residency garners a
couple mentions in Anne Waldman's memoir-anthology NICE TO SEE YOU.  There
Stephen Rodefer has this in his entry:  "The year before last, at a Langton
St. residency in SF, how he groused or pricked the vauntingly guarded crowd
("80 Language Street" as Michael Palmer was calling it)."
Renny Pritikin's piece in the anthology gives his take on the residency
and quotes Berrigan's long statement before his reading, beginning with:

"...at 80 Langton Street I stand in the dock in judgement, condemned, and also
to become informed..."

Pritikin attempts to analyze the situation in sort of a detached, "guarded"
way, implying that Berrigan was doing some ego-poet grandstanding but
not exactly criticizing him for that.  He's very reserved, it seems to me,
in this little memoir - understandably considering the context (a memorial
volume).

These are my sources for the idea that language poets "disapproved" of
Berrigan.  Along with Dave Zauhar I agree this is a long way from the action;
decades, centuries away from the rivalry or whatever - the baiting, the
criticizing, the suspicion, the whatever - that went on in those days
between various poetry clubs on the coasts.  If it went on, even.  If
there were clubs.  It doesn't matter. Berrigan may have been baiting
the language poets whom he saw as a threat - unfairly.  Or he may actually
have been given a chilly, demanding, critical reception.  I sure don't know.
- Henry Gould

thanks for turning me on to the NPR RealAudio archives, Rachel.

I had heard about, but missed, an interview with Diane DiPrima on Feb 18. They
even let her read two poems!

http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/archives/1998/980218.atc.html

I'm enjoying the Berrigan thread very much. Especially the attentive readings.

& am very very saddened by the news of Ron Johnson's death. Ark on!

all best,

yeah i agree, but it seems such a waste that such crap is sold off in graduate
classes and "the Sonnets" sits out of print or somewhere in some person's
attic.
I personally find alot in the "sonnets" that is original, although much
criticism of Berrigan's work centers  around some idea that he is a "thief"/
how ingenius that he borrows lines from other poets etc./ it is so much more
than that-
Ted was proving that it is already there already, the words etc, and it was
his job and pleasure to put them together into "Sonnets" in the way he felt
fit-
The repeating of lines"Dear Chris" and "it is 5:15" etc makes a full reading
of the Sonnets interesting, instead of looking at it as a reference point to
move out and look for the lines he"lifted" from ashbery , i feel it is self-
contained, you do not have to know what lines are Padgetts, or Berrigan's or
Auden's etc, it just works when you read it aloud.
It's funny, I made a request earlier to have someone email me an address to
find a copy of the Sonnets I could own (my copy is out from the university
library)
someone gave me an address on this list and I spoke to the person selling the
books, "sorry the sonnets has been sold!" damn! well, she also asked me why
this week alone she got 4 requests for the sonnets, must be people on this
board trying to snake that copy well its gone! (poets are like crows )I swear
anyways if anyone else would like to sell me a copy I would love to buy it
please let me know-
Oyeah , I read Libbie Rifkin's article in Contemporary Lit on Berrigan. Its
good but I don't think she knows the deal behind who "chris" is she should
read Ron Padgetts memoir on TEd.
about whether or not the "languagepoets" like Berrigan, yeah who cares, I am
sure no one group(although i doubt poets associated with "languagepoetry" even
want to be part of any group) can speak together, i am sure poets of all
traditions can appreciate Berrigan and how he lived the 24 hr life of the poet
later gators

Berrigan is a pivotal figure in a number of ways. One of the threads running
through 1st generation New York School poetries is a veering off from the
"confessionalism" so prevalent at the time.  Interesting, then, how TB
negotiated quotidian realities in his work. Interesting also what an important
precedent __The Sonnets__ constitutes for L=poetry.  I would imagine that, on
some level, Ron Silliman's long poem __Ketjak__is in debt to the fractured
narratives and gorgeous repetition based musics of __The Sonnets__.

At its best, Berrigan's work stands up there with anyone's. At its worst, it
tends toward some of the same self-indulgences Bukowski practiced--a kind of
formulaic sensationalism that can be fun to read but analogous to the "empty
calories" of ________(Fill in the blank with your favorite junk commestible
but be aware of the severe penalties which may obtain under current food libel
laws.).

Hi, Erik:

Sorry, I should have back-channeled you the Sonnets ordering info. I'll keep my
eyes peeled for another. "Some dim frieze," which opens the book, refers to
something Berrigan saw on the Columbia University campus, so in return,
Columbia will pick up the tab if you'd like a photocopy of that edition in the
meantime. (Or, if any of the "crows" want one.) Just lemme know. I also have
the poems from Arshille, if you want a photocopy of that.

Of course, it doesn't finally matter what lines are from where, so long as the
poem works. But, it's also interesting, interesting to me anyway, to think of
his thievery in the contexts of: (a) his class & the extent to which his
aesthetic impulses might be thought of as class-based; and (b) what his
prolific re-use of others's lines (including his own) means in terms of how he
experienced language: "The world has my flesh on," as Vincent Ferrini once
wrote. I think this ties in very nicely with another sub-thread on this list:
His openness to a relatively wide spectrum of poetries. That's a specific form
of being, a particular way of moving through the world, & through the world of
letters.

I'm going to see the woman who runs Pomander Books tonight & so I'll see if I
can get the name of the crow who swept off with your _Sonnets_--then you or I
can build an altar or whatever & Berrigan's ghost (which truly will never die)
will go beat him or her up.

Have fun,

Gary Sullivan

Ted Berrigan taught a class at Naropa on Whalen, Hollo, and James Schuyler.  I
don't recall what year. But if Ashbery, Denby, and O'Hara were the early
inspirations, W/H/S were the enthusiasms when I knew him.  Does anyone know if
those lectures were taped?

I still have copies of a ten-year old issue of Transfer that includes Joel

I'm glad Barry said that; this residency was the only time I ever met Ted
"in the flesh," as they perhaps still say, and his reading of _The Sonnets_
on the Friday night WAS truly remarkable -- it took my breath away. Less
remarkable was the panel discussion the following night with Barry, Ted, and
three others holding forth on "the world" (not the literary magazine, the
space we all share). I agree that it makes little sense to argue over who
liked who -- one of the great things about Ted, as some have stated in this
thread, was that he was so inclusive (catholic with a small c) and could
find good in everything.  (Rachel, wasn't it Wilbur who wrote "Love brings
us to the things of this world" or some such?) I think the best teachers act
in that fashion, widening our narrow prejudices, making generosity part of
poetics; I remember vividly when Lowell died and I made some cynical
crackpot comment and Ed Dorn severely upgraded me -- rightly. Scholars eager
to associate Ted with anti-langpo sentiment, however, may also remember a
one paragraph dismissive "review" of Ted's on a book by Steven Rodefer that
was a source of consternation among some, bemusement among others. But so
what, really? What I actually wanted to comment on was Tom Beckett's post
about Ted, when he praised him at his best, but at his worst said he was
full of "formulaic sensationalism," "fun to read but . . . empty". Now come
on. What, really, is BETTER than "fun to read"? What else is there? Why is
pleasure ever denigrated? This made me think of O'Hara's "Personalism" when
he says (not exactly, don't have it around) "What are we building people up
for? For what?" Folks, poetry is not "good for us" -- thank the Gods!

Several lines from Watten's MFA thesis, "white yellow" (submitted to the
University of Iowa, early seventies):

I guess I want this to be
a kind of "Tambourine Life"
but I am not that nervous
Irish mother fucker
who put me down
in Iowa City.

Someone who has this text on hand, or more-or-less immediate access to it
(Katy?) should quote it verbatim. (The above is nearly word-for-word, but
line-breaks are no doubt wrong & there's maybe a missing word or two.)

I always wondered whether his (Watten's) sentiment was genuine, there, or not.
Anyone know?

I posted re-berrigan as soon as I'd read ron silliman's post. but my post
hasnt yet appeared and meanwhile, i've read thru the rest, and while i take
comfort in the amount of overlap between what i wrote and what others of

Joseph is pointing toward another aspect of Berrigan's work that has
always struck me - he has a charismatic community organizer's energy
(much like the catholic organizers out of Holy Cross, Bridgeport,
Worcester, and other seedy [note: not grungy] New England places
I spent many years amongst) which establishes a vortex zone
or playpen for poetry - and the playpen changes the flavor of
the poetry.  It is "not good for us" outside of the zone of its
own reality.  It is "for" that reality & self-sufficient of itself.
It is not didactic - it is playFUL. People DO get tired of playing
sometimes, tired of the zone.  Then they get "serious" and avoid
the petty, the self-centered, the superficial... become ponderous,
self-centered, superficial...

I have ground this axe about Berrigan before on the list (see back
a few months to the "Teddy Bear" discussions), and I acknowledge &
apologize for its projectivism & broad-brushism & lack of close
readerism of poemism.  I apologize.  But what you are reading is
an effect of Berrigan, just another aspect.  end of post. - Henry G.

Great thread everyone on Ted Berrigan. I immediately ran out and got
Joel Lewis's wonderful book of Ted's talks. Anselm Hollo has worked
weird and splendid wonders with Ted's talks in his "Lines From Ted" in
_Corvus_. Here's a sample from one of them:

"... what I think happens when a poem works is
That it rises into the air of its own powers
And in doing so it has formed a circle
And it becomes something like the sun or a star
Or a planet...
I have to go now
I have to go and think about this for at thousand       years."

Ron Silliman - I was talking last night to Andrew Schelling about Ronald
Johnson and he recalled a series of talks Ron gave in Berekely one of
which you participated in. Though it was Andrew's impression that RJ was
a little less than kindly disposed toward LangPo. Another scurrilous
barb? He also mentioned a book of concrete poetry that Johnson produced
- which I found very curious indeed. Has anyone heard of this -- or read
it?

Johnson was simply a magnificent poet. One of the greatest. I can't help
but feel his early passing has deprived us of who knows what great work.
During a talk I gave today on Hopkins I segued into a brief eulogy for
Johnson - though no one, including my professor, had ever heard of him.
(I'm learning  - as Don Byrd alluded to some time back - just what a
dearth of poetic knowledge exists in my English Dept). Here's some lines

It wasn't an interview with DiPrima.  We should only be so lucky.  They (=
Susan Stamberg?) talked to some scholar, a certain lack of vibrancy in the
response shall we say ("DiPrima believes..." locutions, as if she is fixed
forever) but there was more time given to Diane reading than to this other
woman talking, and the pleasure of running errands and flipping on the
radio and suddenly hearing DiPrima reading --- that was great!

The brief description in the beginning of DiPrima was also pretty good.  It
went something like "beatnik Buddhist revolutionary mother of five."

I always find it weird to read about people I know even a little, or hear
them discussed, in that detached and "objective" way.  Always the essence
is missing.  Makes me wonder why I believe what I read or hear about people
I don't know.

Wallace's piece, Definitions in Process, etc. etc.in FlushPoint magazine
is much ado about nothing; a transparent attempt to get some names out

pouring the gasoline and lighting the match he snuggles up to it. One is
left with the distinct knowledge that there is no unread pile of hard
disks and no post-pepsi generation of scribblers that can be called
Post-Language. Besides what a weak branch to graft onto. Where do we go
from here but toward the light? "[P]ostlanguage poetry as a distinct
moment in the history of poetry."?! Give me a break. The Language poets
put the critical cart before the imaginative horse. Mark wants to go
them one better. Horsemeat anyone?

As regards my comment in Moyer's piece concerning Messerli/Perloff
interview in Aerial: I was demonstrating that Doug readily acquiesced to
a return to the nostalgic and narrative impulse of his poem. He seemed
to love the psychological moment of creation (and by extension himself)
more than the langpo formula. I simply noted that this rush to solpisism
was difficult to distinguish from the example from Robert Hass I
sighted. In this instance it revealed to this reader that Langpo might
be simply one step from the confessional and a contrived step at that.
Does the silly honesty of a Hass drive us to pedantic excess and denial?
And Furthermore re Poem in Regress---anybody who objects to Herman Kahn,
(e.g. On Thermonuclear War, Hudson Institute, RAND Corp.), being
profiled in Hell doesn't know his/her Herman Kahn.-Carlo Parcelli

Rightly said Joe wrt fun & plezhure in poetry. It does appear that pleasure is
devalued at times hereabouts. Perhaps this is just another manifestation of
making light of the lite (as in lite poetry which has almost always been looked
down upon). Perhaps too any denial of pleasure is only a public one. Poetry is
good for us in as much as it is good for the heart -- makes us laugh or smile
(wryly perhaps as we watch it subvert and civilize the wholesome). Just as long
as the pleasure paradigm doesn't itself become a cliche. Funny too is that much
of langpo has often been seen by Yo as being quite fun, funny, lite, etc (you
know: no ideas but in thingys). I can scarcely read Coolidge, for ex., without
a big, cracked smile from ear-to-ear.

Thanks, Katy:

But, tentativeness with respect to reading theses? They're written w/the
knowledge they'll be more-or-less "available" to the public, & are usually
housed in libraries. Journals & letters--*very* private things--might be more
worthy of second thoughts prior to looking into . . . thinking back to an
earlier thread . . .

Yours,

Gary

I'm not sure how to take this witty reply--

I guess, though--to clarify.

Turning in a thesis is not the same as publishing--

One has to turn a thesis in order to get the degree--

One does not have to publish a book--

Some of the theses turned in here are, in fact, books (Doug Powell's
wonderful book, Tea, just out on Wesleyan, is basically his "thesis"--).
Others are simply first attempts at organizing peoms--or compendiums or
whatever--

Martin Corless-Smith's thesis is nothing like his recent and incredible
book Of Piscator--

etc.

Best,
Katy

Remarkable post from DB.  Actually Berrigan seems the complete opposite
of isolato poet.  But perhaps it's not for nothing that this ego lives
near the "Cranston Line".  I firmly believe I got into college because of
Ted Berrigan [my college application included an extended adolescent
imitation of "Tambourine Life".  I'm sure Jeff Hansen will be happy
to dig it up out of Blake School TALISMAN].  So he can't be all anti-
intellectual if he gets kids into college. But speaking of carrying the
Word - isolato is trying to carry it to all them poet's poet's poet's
poet's poet's [infinity] poets who DO read Adorno etc., Lawdy hep em.

Well this little mini-thread may have completely unspooled by now, BUT I think
one way of looking at the Rez poem is as being about *survival*.  It's one of
the ones Oppen remembered when he was lying in the foxhole, wounded, among
some others who were dead.   Was it "anti-democratic" of Oppen to be alive?
He *did* feel guilty, but there it was, a fact.

In Memoriam

                Ronald Johnson, 1935-1998


In ark-dive,
grey encomium.
Grey imperium of
the all-day rust-dawn
 -ed day.
If amen, then a willow
& its sibilance too.
Or water bluster
in stone-cracked creek.
Force of lone stone empty
on an earth swept
wide.
And stricken by
late winter-sun-and-lance.
By this tide, great gong:
ever-and-a-going
gone.
We go so -- in measure-
less tread, dividing
song from wing.
Particle-cleave, (parousia)
your run is ended.
A nascent valence
resumes.
Foremost among foot-
falls and sober
in Elysium to be going
if light there is ever sober
or windonsea any-
thing but claritas,
supra urbem, supra sapientia,
bells building spire
on spire in the true
font of soul+s un-
encrypted in-
scription.

        (Hover a while.
        Breathe this and be glad
        of  it.

Hmm, not new formalists but new formulaic sensationalists!  I might just
enlist--any relation to Ashbery's sect of "ascetic sensualists" with its
eleven funerals?  I do think comparing Bukowski with Berrigan (even at
his weakest) is pretty wide of the mark, even though they're both dead.

Apparently I haven't been able to lure Pierre out of lurkerdom long
enough to name his favorite bad poets.  No intent (at all) to tweak
him--I really wanted to know (and think this would be an important clue
to the work of any significant writer).

My point was a serious one, and it's that we don't learn only where we
think we SHOULD learn.  That learning, perhaps a bit like "falling in
love," is cheerfully random, and makes for odd bedfellows.  I only wish
Berrigan's catholicity of taste were more fashionable today--inbreeding,
seems to me, makes for pale and squeamish poetry.

A couple more notes.

Ron S. remarks in his first post that Ted B would have disapproved of
certain kinds of attention, and thus former students have not written as
much about him as about others.  First, I don't think Ted objected to
attention to either his poetry or his person, and second, there is
actually an enormous memoir literature about Ted, as well as the
Scalapino interview book and the Joel Lewis lectures book, so that I
would say he is reasonably well documented.  Don't getme wrong, I would
be overjoyed to have a collected complete poems, I would be interested in
published volumes or selections from Ted's notebooks/journals, and I
would love to read a biography ala Unterecker on Hart Crane or a critical
study like Perloff onO'Hara.  But among non-academic post WWII poets,
besides Ginsberg, O'Hara, Spicer, Snyder, Baraka and Ashbery, who has
received more attention?

Second, there has been some surprise about Ted's liking for certain
academic poets (the Wilbur poem Ted told me he liked was the one about
laundry, in which the line "Love calls us to the things of this world"
appears, I think) and some discussion whether "language poets" approved
of him or not.  First, the Berrigan of the language poets (author of The
Sonnets) is not everybody's Berrigan.  Second, among the poets whose work
Ted did not like so much were several important language ancestors, e.g.,
Jackson MacLow and Louis Zukofsky.  Partly this was Ted responding to the
downtown fashions around the time he first "came on the scene," and
partly because he did his real appropriations (not lines, but structural
ideas) from these guys -- he said that Jackson was too serious about
himself and that Zukofsky's Catullus wasn't funny, when it ought to have
been.  But at least the education I absorbed from Ted, after the obvious
like Denby O'Hara Schuyler Whalen Hollo Ashbery, was tilted towards
certain academic poets -- F.T. Prince and not Richard Howard -- and
based on the idea that if you could get away with it, it was better to be
influenced by and steal from Shakespeare than Ezra Pound.

In philosphy, Ted read assiduously and was influenced by Alfred
North Whitehead, not some jackoff German or Frenchman!

Finally, how about Bean Spasms (the book)?  That book is totally great!
Why doesn't somebody reprint it!

The speculations on Berrigan's class background that have come up seem to
me pretty fruitful ones.  But this connection between his "lower class"
status and "thievery" has come up a couple of times now--and without wanting
to sound righteous or anything, it has always seemed to be that the wealthy
do the best stealing.  You may not notice the book missing from your
shelf--it probably just didn't get written in the first place.  steve

I propose we give the self-characterization of the week award to dave
zauhar for the above. Not that it's accurate to him, but it's accurate to
someone, maybe someone you havent met yet. It's wild! As my teenager says,
"Cool". Woody Allen will appropriate it, I suppose : "Wh-wh-who you think I

lot of money for its use. Thank you, Dave!               David

I'm hardly anti-fun & I'm not anti-Berrigan. However, biography is put to use
as part of Berrigan's poetic methodology.  Sometimes the results are sublime,
but the pitfalls are there to be seen.

Bukowski and Berrigan--I don't want to belabor this.  TB's obviously the
better writer.  There is, however, a broad comparison to be made on the basis
of the presentation of self in the work.  Bukowski: I woke up, threw up, drank
a beer, went to the track, got laid, threw up, drank a beer...etc.  Berrigan:
I woke up, drank a Pepsi, popped some pills, did this, did that, drank a
Pepsi, popped some pills, etc.
Sometimes a manner comes to matter too much and gets in the way. I was
pointing to this when I used the phrase "formulaic sensationalism."

Wrapping his work with his biography makes it difficult to criticize the work
without seeming to criticize the author. I think that this is a modest but
important point. Berrigan took a lot of risks --in his work and in his life.
He wasn't always successful.  Who is?

Just curious--what is it that Kathy Acker's fiction was taken up
by some critics and championed precisely because she "plagiarized,"
attacked the idea of the "true, original voice," etc. while the dis-
cussion of Berrigan seems to suggest that he is somehow still
under suspicion of having committed crimes. Also, I think it's good
to remember when these issues come up that way back when in English
poetry (please, someone with a bit of scholarship, help me out here) it was
    accepted practice to take over a line of poetry from a contemporary
and rewrite it for your own poem.

Subject:      ted & langpo
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

i do feel there was mutual respect between ted & many of the language poets
--why invite him to 80 langton street, just to harass him.

the idea that langpoets where hostile to ted is part tom clark's comments
and part of the politics around the po project in the early 80's.

there was a great deal of hostility between ted'd accolytes and langpoets
in those days. in those days, wed readings would team up a st, mark's poet
and a lnag poet (i remember elinor nauen & diane ward as an example).
Depending on who read first, there would be a walkout by many of the
followers of teh first reader. this was repeated in smaller venues and
earinn had entirely different audeinces based on who was curating the
series.

in addition to poetry wars, there were style clashes. st. marks poets where
still doing mimeo books, while language poets had moved onto perfect bound
books and mags. there was a vast economic difference--many st. marks poets
had no visible means of support, while some langauge poets, like james
sherry, worked day gigs and a poet Bruce Andrew was a tenured professor.
and then there was politics--st. marks ranged from apolitical to a
nostalgic romanticism for the poet-warriors of nicaragua/ laanguage poetry
was fairly identified with neo-marxism and post-structuralism. and then
there was cultural prefernces -- while many st markers where forming punk
bands, poets like charles b. & bruce a. where working with zorn, sally
silvers, arakawa & others

ted did not get that involved with much of the above. i do remeber that he
like l=a=ng magazine & that he marked up his copies of poetics journal and
was engaging the work of writers like barret watten. it is worth tracking
down (or someone reprinting) the whole of the pritikin 80 lang st report
(that was published in their annual summaries) that gives the flavor of the
residency that seems equal parts of ted poking and trying to statrt
arguements and folks like barret trying to engage him.

I was one of the ear curators when a young language poet (I forget who)
took over some of the saturdays (I think it was saturdays--age
creepeth...). What you say about the different audiences is certainly true,
and it didn't matter who was reading. I regularly had Jackson read. Only
one or two language poets would show up. Likewise for Wieners and others.
This was mysterious to me. The well-defined avant-garde that existed in NY
before the advent of language poetry didn't seem to interest the langpo
crowd except when it was on its own turf. Of course, the explanation may be
as simple as the social reality of an ongoing series as a floating
party--if you know the host you get to hang out with a predictable crowd of

                The Literal World
                by Jean Day

Atelos, a newly founded publishing project, announces the publication of
_The Literal World_ by Jean Day.


About the book:
        In response to a commission from Atelos, Jean Day has written a sequence of
poems exploring the public and private worlds of vernacular adventure.
Entitled _The Literal World_, the book's sections play off various American
genres -- Protestant sermons (and the idea of a lost paradise), Lewis and
Clark's journals of exploration, and the Western among them. As
contributions to the invention of American identity, these genres constitute
formative narratives -- accounts of an America its 'fathers and mothers'
sought to create. As a private parallel to the experience of this public
view, Day concludes The Literal World with a section entitled "Narratives
from the Crib" -- offering an intimate but wry, tender but individualistic
(and hence quintessentially American), account by an infant of the person he
or she is meant someday to be. Using experimental techniques, and informed
by a wide range of historical and philosophical detail, the poetry in this
book is about the very expectations it challenges. The result is 'the
literal world' that is named in the title -- an adventure in the sublimities
of invention.


About the author:
        Jean Day grew up in Rhode Island and moved to San Francisco in the
mid-1970s. She is the author of four previous books of poetry (_Linear C_,
_Flat Birds_, _A Young Recruit_, _The I and the You_) and the recipient of
grants from the California Arts Council and the Fund for Poetry. Her own
works have been translated into Finnish, Swedish, Russian, French, and
Spanish, and her translations of works by the contemporary Russian poet,
Nadezhda Kondakova, have appeared in anthologies. She lives in Berkeley,
California, where she works as Associate Editor for the journal
_Representations_.


About the project:
        Atelos was founded in 1995, as a project of Hip's Road and devoted to
publishing, under the sign of poetry, writing which challenges the
conventional definitions of poetry, since such definitions have tended to
isolate it from intellectual life, arrest its development, and curtail its
impact. All the works published as part of the Atelos project are
commissioned specifically for it, and each is involved in some way with
crossing traditional genre boundaries, including, for example, those that
would separate theory from practice, poetry from prose, essay from drama,
the visual image from the verbal, the literary from the non-literary, and so
forth. The Atelos project when complete will consist of 50 volumes. The
project directors and editors are Lyn Hejinian and Travis Ortiz; the
director for production and design is Ree Hall.


Ordering information:
        _The Literal World_ may be ordered from Small Press Distribution, 1341

Seems like every poet establishes a unique relation between work & biography.
Look at Villon, for example.  One would think a poet who is self-indulgent
and exhibitionist & self-centered is taking the risk of making the work
dependent on the personality & the immediate local, so that it will soon
fade from interest.  But the reason Villon remains of interest is he brings
the 13th century or whatever to life just by being so narrowly focused on
what he's doing & egotistical about it.  I know this is an exaggeration &
Villon remains interesting basically because he was a great lyric poet &
craftsman of the ballads of his time.  Mandelstam has a whole essay about
Villon's curiously impersonal sense of his own person.  I am not gonna compare
Berrigan & Villon at the moment; just that these issues are really complicated
& every reader of poetry has the same problem quantum physicists do in
"taking measurements": their shadow gets in the way of the lens.

I'd like to invite those interested in submitting work for a section on
Ronald Johnson in my magazine ANGLE. The work can either be poetry, short
essays, apprecitions, etc. If I recieve enough work I may do a special
issue rather than just a section. There is a deadline of June 1st. I look
forward to hearing from anyone out there regarding this.

Brian:

Would you be interested in previously published material?  One of my
mathematical poems was a tribute to Ronald.  It's been published in
several zines and is now up at Karl Young's Light & Dust site at:

          http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/lighthom.htm

I'd be really pleased if you could use it in your magazine--but would
understand if not.

could someone inform on the location of the 1892 PARADISE LOST Ronald
Johnson used for and in RADI OS ? i have heard that much of Johnson's
work has already been archived somewhere in kansas, and therefore it may
be there, but don't know that for sure or where exactly that archive is.
and could someone back channel Peter O'Leary's address. thanks -- LE

Take, for instance, Murdoch kabashing a book critical of China because he

Subject:      Re: Doublespace

A week or so ago there were a couple of posts regarding my book
_Doublespace_.  Patrick Pritchett and Jacques Debrot had raised some
questions about the form of the book.  I had hoped to reply sooner,
but was unable to.
  _Doublespace: Poems 1971-1989_ (Segue, 1992, 192 pages) is an odd
book.  It opens in two directions, is _not_ a collected or selected,
but is instead a deliberately made book in a conflicted or multiple
manner, including under one cover seemingly incompatible modes of
writing, from more "mainstream" narratives & lyrics to a range of
more fragmented and collaged material.  Book Two, which consists of
three sections including the eight poem cycle of Law-Poems (which
incorporates material from the Alabama Legal Code), opens (like a
Hebrew book) from the back and moves inward to blank middle.
  I've written at some length about _Doublespace_ (in the Gale
Research autobiography series, Volume 27), so I don't want to repeat
all that's there, but will excerpt a few passages.  Various blurbers--
back cover includes statements by Susan Howe and David Ignatow--have
different takes on the book.  I'll cite two responses that didn't get
on the book jacket.  George Starbuck wrote, "I was handed this as a
finest, newest specimen of 'Language' Poetry, which it is, which it
is. And I had been wondering if 'Language' 'Poetry' would be getting
over its Molierian amazement at itself.  And so I trudged, clambored,
sauntered, stooped, for a long ways, tracking H Lazer's ingenuities
and discoveries, a long way into it all before I woke up to where
(and how) I had been taken.  What a lovely, capacious, populous poem-
of-America surrounded me. Hailed me, corralled me, jargoned at me.
Jazzy and matter-of-factly apocalyptic."  David Antin writes that
_Doublespace_ "appears to present two ways of thinking and working
that contend for the same (doubled space): a modernist way   the way
of collage  that fragments and assembles langauge  registers and
styles in a junkyard of mediated texts, and an older narrative way
taht tracks its meaning through life experience under the fitful
lights of memory and desire; moving from right to left like
Hebrew or left to right like English, the two ways refuse to blend,
each exhibiting its own excellences and insufficiencies."
  None of which answers Patrick and Jacques's questions about the
blank section in the middle, which for me represents a period of
three years of writing which I've thrown away, writing which allowed
me to move away from modes of Book One and begin the work of Book
Two.  (Though now I do not feel such a separation.)  The structure of
the overall book poses various questions:  are the modes of reading
for Book One at all compatible with Book Two? once sincerity has
been understood as a trick of rhetoric, what contexts remain
available for personal expressiveness?
  _Doublespace_ was the first book of poetry that I had published.
I was 42 when it appeared.
  The book will soon go out of print.  List price is $12.  If you'd
like a copy, I'll sell what I have for $9 each (which includes
postage).

As long as everybody remembers to associate Pepsi and Gem Spa with
Berrigan, everything should keep moving nicely. The brand name in poetry,

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've always read Charles Bernstein's remark
that "It's a mistake to posit the self as the center of one's writing" (I
think I must have butchered that) as a remix of Ted Berrigan's apparently

section is to the staff) and I can't help but think Berrigan was as much
influenced by Olson's public persona as by Whalen's poetics. Human Universe
made it onto at least one of Ted's Top Ten Books of the Year poems. Bigman?
At any rate, someone to contend with -- poetry as friendly competition?

Re: Tom Beckett's freaky connection of Berrigan with Bukowski; sure, and
Patchen and Ferlinghetti and cummings and Corso and Brautigan.. but
Berrigan is a lighter touch, becomes available to people later in their
lives, no way could I have read Berrigan and got it at 14 (in 1984) the way
I got Ferlinghetti (and Patchen?), or for that matter a year or so later,
Paul Violi.. or Edwin Denby and Fiona Templeton a year or so after that..
and Tom Raworth. If you have to compare artists in terms of their
"projects", in terms of what, for each, was the deal, then there's a little
Matisse in Ted, that art should be comforting? and also Olson (the Tony
Door side of Olson, not the Susan Howe side), that the poet is always "on".

am I really saying Berrigan shouldn't be thought of as a "gateway drug"?

Kim Lyons' poem "Eon" in the Jarnot/Schwartz/Stroffolino anthology is where
I point you today.

yes, very much Olson and Berrigan, I see them very differently but they were
both very much into the technique of writing, possibly Berrigan didn't express
this as much as Olson but I see it there.
I would love to get more on what Olson and Berrigan talked about all night on
that park bench in Buffalo, I KNOW that there are some people on this list who
know all about it! so tell...
Jordan, in almost every picture of Berrigan I have seen there is a Pepsi can
lingering somewhere near bye, well what can I say, Coke doesn't taste as
great, they probably should have left the cocaine in ...!!
P.S. anyone know any real good places to go in New Mexico, I will be visiting
there soon and have never been to the Southwest or anywhere really away from
New York State so let me know where to go what to see, I will be there the
week of March 13-20, back channel me then thanks all, erik

Comments: To: poetics@UBVM.cc.buffalo.edu

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Listmates,

Steve McCaffery has been shafted -- seriously so -- for the second time in one y
ear by Temple
University.

Last fall, the English Department at Temple conducted a major search for a poet,
 bringing in
applications from many major writers, including several on this list, before sel
ecting Steve for a tenure
track position. Then the Department learned that funding for the position would
not be made available
and Steve was dehired. As appalling as that scenario was, this wasn't the first
time that Temple has
done this. Andrew Levy, I believe, was on the receiving end of a virtually ident
ical set of
circumstances a couple of years ago. And, as friends of Douglas Messerli and Dav
id Bradley know,
Temple also has a track record of being less than good to the writers it does ha
ve, once it employs
them.

To be hired and then "dehired" by a school is a totally disruptive act for the p
erson who is treated like
so much chattel. In addition to the sheer psychic abuse, it also takes the write
r off the market during
precisely the period when other, alternative academic jobs might become availabl
e.

Apparently, the department realized that poets of McCaffery's stature aren't jus
t sitting around on
trees and an effort was made to secure the budget line and undo the damage creat
ed by the original
dehiring. Steve was finally hired and set to arrive in Philadelphia in June. MIT
 Press is even
advertising him as Associate Professor of English at Temple in his ads for Imagi
ning Language (an
anthology he co-edited with Jed Rasula that is due out later this Spring).  At l
east, this was the
scenario until, as I understand it, the president learned of an appointment and
again stopped it cold.

The rationale behind stopping the appointment is that the school's enrollment ha
s dropped some nine
percent. But, given Temple's treatment of faculty, and especially of poets, this
 is sort of a "duh" kind
of an excuse. The amazing thing is that Temple's enrollment hasn't dropped much
further, given the
active role the administration seems to be taking in driving good teachers and s
tudents away.

I haven't spoken with Steve or Karen -- only with students and faculty literally
 spitting with anger and
frustration over this -- but my understanding is that when they left for a tempo
rary gig in the UK, they
gave up their apartment in Toronto and may even have turned down real work under
 the illusion that
Temple meant what it said in hiring Steve.

 What can be done? There are different opinions. Some think that the university
administration has so
screwed up that it can be shamed into reversing itself this time. That's the opt
imistic view.

Presuming, for the moment, optimism, people should write letters to the followin
g administrators:

Peter Liacouras
President
2nd Floor, Sullivan Hall
Temple University
Philadelphia, PA 19122

Susan Albertine
Vice President for Undergraduate Studies
4th Floor, Conwell Hall
Temple University
Philadelphia, PA 19122

Corinne Caldwell
Acting Provost
4th Floor, Conwell Hall
Temple University
Philadelphia, PA 19122

People should stress the following:

Temple University will not reverse enrollment declines by deepening a reputation
 as a place that good
students and teachers should avoid. Teaching positions are not where economies s
hould be taken if
increasing enrollment is a serious concern. (In my line of work, the company tha
t spends 15 percent
of revenues on SG&A -- sales and administration -- goes out of business; I'd lov
e to see how much
Temple spends.)

Steve McCaffery is not a yo-yo. He's a major poet with an international reputati
on earned over
decades of innovative work. At the height of his career. Go into detail about wh
at this means. Folks
on the wr-eye-tings list ought to think about having Steve on tenure track at a
major school would
mean for contemporary vizpo, not to mention performance poetry etc etc.

Steve McCaffery would prove especially inspiring to undergraduate students (an a
rea of particular
sensitivity here). Anybody who took a course with him at Buffalo or elsewhere wo
uld have great
credence. Frankly, I think that anyone who's ever seen read in person knows that
 this would be true.

I'd also appreciate it if anyone who sends a letter would send me a copy.

Thanks,

Yes, clearly a similar sort of reportage goes on.  But inside the poems
(I think Tom would agree) these reports function in a very different
way.  Bukowski's posture is heroic and the details are there to document
his (vomit-spattered) glory.  In Berrigan the details are folded in as a
sort of counterpoint.  They are dull, they are giddily romantic, they
don't want only one thing for the poem.

Some first thoughts anyway--

Poets:

The City of Vancouver has turned down the Kootenay School of Writing's
1998 application for an operating grant. This is the first time in more
than eight years that the city has decided not to award KSW a grant. In
fact, last year the city increased KSW's grant. This makes for a crisis
which threatens the continued existence of the Kootenay School, as this
one grant has provided roughly half of KSW's annual income.

The Kootenay School of Writing was founded fifteen years ago by a group of
writers who had moved to Vancouver when funding for the school where they
taught and learned, the David Thompson University Centre in Selkirk, B.C.,
in the Kootenay Mountains, was eliminated from the budget of the (Social
Credit) government of British Columbia. The School has been a completely
volunteer-run, collectively administered organization throughout its
fifteen year history. During that time KSW has sponsored writing
workshops and seminars and maintained a venue for new and interesting
writing, where writers from Vancouver and surrounding communities, from
other parts of British Columbia and across Canada, from the United States,
the United Kingdom, and other countries have read their work. The Kootenay
School maintains a full schedule: during the past few weeks, Jeff Derksen
and Susan Holbrook have read; the latest issue of _Open Letter,_ edited by
Jeff Derksen, was launched; a memorial reading for Kathy Acker to benefit
the Breast Cancer Foundation was held with readers including Dorothy
Trujillo Lusk, Sharon Thesen, Kate Van Dusen and Deanna Ferguson; and
(last night) Rob Manery, Bill Luoma and Juliana Spahr read from recent
work.

Many of you on this list have read or given workshops at the Kootenay
School of Writing; others have been pleased to be members of the audience
or have taken KSW workshops. The Kootenay School has survived and
flourished on very little money. The operating grant application to the
City of Vancouver is a very small one, about $4000.00. This money is used
to support a reading space and an office which is staffed year-round by
volunteers. The space is shared with the Or Gallery at 112 West Hastings
in Vancouver (not a high-rent area).

The City gave as a reason for turning down this grant application that the
Kootenay School's "audience base" is not broad enough. KSW members are
asking the city to clarify this judgement, particularly since recent and
past programming has emphasized building and increasing cultural diversity
in reading programs. Audiences are consistently as large as those of most
other reading series in Vancouver, if not larger. And I can't think of any
series (other than those sponsored by the Public Library) which are as
long-lived as KSW's.

The Kootenay School is now asking for support from as many people as are
willing to write a letter. If you have read at KSW, or given a talk or a
workshop, or if you have taken a workshop or been an audience member and
you feel moved to help KSW, please write a letter urging the City of
Vancouver to restore grant funding. You can send an e-mail to Rob Manery,
who is coordinating the effort to persuade the City to reverse its
decision. His e-address is geschwitz@intergate.bc.ca. Or you can write
directly to the City of Vancouver, Mayor Philip Owen, Vancouver City Hall,
453 West 12th Avenue, Vancouver, B.C. V5Y 1V4. Or you can write,
care of the same address, to any of Vancouver's ten city councillors: Don
Bellamy, Nancy A. Chiavario, Jennifer Clarke, Alan Herbert, Lynne Kennedy,
Daniel Lee, Don Lee, Gordon Price, George Puil, or Sam Sullivan. E-mail
can be addressed to: info@city.vancouver.bc.ca. PLEASE DO NOT WRITE TO
THIS LIST, OR TO MY ADDRESS, BUT BACKCHANNEL OR BY REGULAR MAIL TO THE
ADDRESSES GIVEN ABOVE. For more information, write to Rob Manery.

Thanks for whatever support you can give to the Kootenay School.

P.S. I'll be at work on various projects for the next few weeks, so I'll
be off the poetics list for that time. People who want to be in touch
backchannel can reach me via my e-address.

Best to you all,

Charles Watts

When I published The Difficulties I never received any of the grants I applied
for. I went into debt. Depend on grants at your peril.

 If even half of the people on this list contributed 10-20 dollars to
Kootenay, we could eliminate its 4000 dollar deficit.

I've never benefited from the school directly but believe that we all benefit
in the end when we support such projects. When we support one another.

I'm hoping that someone will post how to make contributions.  I can manage 10
bucks and hope that others will help out too.

Steve McCaffery has asked me to post the following clarification to the list in
relation to Ron Silliman's post -- Pierre

To All Concerned:

A short corrective to Ron Silliman's recent post on my "shafting by
Temple."  Ron acted a little prematurely and, not having contacted me,
communicated a somewhat erroneous state of events.  Actually, I had already
decided in favour of York University and Toronto over Temple and
Philadelphia. Without going into detail, in the past few weeks Temple's
bureaucracy had given both Karen and myself cause for increasing
frustration and misgiving. Last fall I had also applied for an advertised
position at York University in Toronto.  When York's offer arrived it was
competitive and appealing, so on Feb. 26th the decision was made.
This, of course, is no excuse for Temple's action and no condemnation of
Ron's zealous call to action.  However, I hope it clarifies that I accepted
York over Temple before final news of the freezing of the position came
into effect  Happily at this point Canada is immune to the style of
gun-boat diplomacy that the so-called paragon nation of democracy conducts
so frequently and effectively.  Recall, perhaps, the shafting of Susan
Stewart by Havard.  So be it publicly known.
Ron's other comments on giving up our place in Toronto are similarly
unfounded; all is well with us in Toronto and I look forward to offering
exciting courses in contemporary literature and poetics at a fine
institution.

I support Tom B's suggestion that contributions be made to Kootenay.  I will
be pleased to contribute, as well.  Although I have not personally
participated in activities there, it is my perception that they are
contributing in a terrific way to things that many of us hold as high values.

Give us an address, and we'll get this (contribution) thing moving ahead.

I'd like to publicly thank Nick Piombino and Liz Fedowksi for arranging for
me to read in the Seque/Here series in NYC this past Saturday. Arranging
readings, publicizing them, setting up chairs, and all that is something of
a thankless task, and takes a generous spirit to provide the energy. So
thank you, Liz and Nick, and all others who provide stages for our work. In
Washington, it seems, little would happen without the seemingly endless
energy and good spirit of people like Mark Wallace, Heather Fuller, Buck
Downs Ann Wallace and Rod Smith. Thank you all.

DEMOCRACY AND THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE:  A NATIONAL LABOR TEACH-IN
April 24-26, 1998
George Washington University
Washington, D.C.

        Scholars, Artists, and Writers for Social Justice is sponsoring an
important public event this spring, entitled "Democracy and the Right to
Organize: A National Labor Teach-in." This convocation, which will be held
April 24-26 on the George Washington University campus in Washington, D.
C., will bring together hundreds of academics, students, trade unionists,
and social activists to explain, advocate, debate, and celebrate the right
of all Americans to organize, both on the job and off.

        Plenary speakers on the evening of Friday, April 24, include
Julian Bond, civil rights activist recently elected chair of the NAACP
board of directors; John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO; Kimberle
Crenshaw, Columbia University professor of law; Steve Fraser, editor and
writer; Juliet Schor, Harvard University economist; and Robin D. G.
Kelley, New York University historian. More than a dozen workshops, plus
the first annual meeting of Scholars, Artists, and Writers for Social
Justice, will be held on Saturday, April 25.

        SAWSJ, whose members have sponsored more than a score of labor
teach-ins at universities and colleges across the country, believes that
democracy and dignity at work and in American society requires the right
to self-organization. But tens of millions of American workers are today
denied this essential right. SAWSJ insists that whatever legal, political,
managerial, or bureaucratic obstacles stand in the way of a genuinely
unfettered right to organize must be swept aside in the interests of
American democracy itself. This is a task, not only for the labor
movement, but for all those who want to make the Bill of Rights a living
document in the 21st century.

        Saturday workshops will include sessions on labor and political
action, the future of the Teamsters union, organizing the South, labor and
the law, student activism, labor's connection to other social movements,
and more. Among those who will be speaking at these workshops are legal
scholar Karl Klare; Ken Paff of Teamsters for a Democratic Union;
historians Gary Gerstle, David Brody, Andor Skotnes, and Nelson
Lichtenstein; student activist Ligaya Domingo; sociologists Allen Hunter,
Dan Clawson, Stanley Aronowitz, and Lynn Chancer; American studies scholar
Nikhil Singh; labor educators Elaine Bernard, Kate Bronfenbrenner and Tom
Juravich; and numerous trade unionists, including Bruce Raynor, Lane
Windham, and Joe Uehlein.  Tami Gold and Kelly Anderson, co-producers of
the documentary film _Out at Work_, will also participate.

        SAWSJ will hold its first annual meeting on Sunday, April 26,
where it will elect its first set of officers. The group envisions a
movement that can reshape the nation's political culture and foster the
growth of a vibrant, militant, multicultural working-class movement. The
labor movement needs an academic, cultural, and intellectual community
that helps shape the terms of public debate, contesting corporate
dominance of politics and culture. In turn, professors, students, artists,
and writers need a progressive unionism that can provide a powerful voice
for social justice. The time is ripe to restore that mutually empowering
relationship that once gave hope and dynamism to the labor movement and
its allies in the academic and cultural communities.

     To register, to join SAWSJ, and/or to be added to our e-mail mailing

$10 is a week of food for me, but Xexoxial would gladly donate some
copies of Hannah Weiner's WEEKS (which sell for $9 american) that maybe
could be resold, or perhaps auctioned in a fundraiser.

maybe the funding climate is different canada ways, but depending on
government funding for half of the orgs support seems mighty
unsustainable, XE even tho it is a 501(c)3 has maybe gotten a thousand
or 2 toward publishing & events in its 12 years of existence & maybe
another 5 toward renovation of buildings, even tho it owns 4 houses & a
28,000 sq ft old school. then again we live in wisconsin where funding
for the arts is 48th with only arkansas & alaska behind us.
I also agree with Tom B's sentiments (I seem to find myself nodding with
a lot of what Tom has been saying) that

"I've never benefited from the school directly but believe that we all
benefit in the end when we support such projects. When we support one
another."

& further that when an organization can be supported directly, that its
continued presence makes a decided mark on the culture outside of its
institutions.  & how many incredible projects have we seen go down the
tubes when the nea took a dive.

Dear Gary and all--I hate to say it, but I can't seem to find Watten's
thesis here--it's in some kind of permanent storage--or is otherwise not
in the computer (neither is Alice Notley's)--I'll keep my eyes open, but

Subject:      T. Wood's query re publishing

How can poets find publishers?  How can publishers find poetry?

How can the world find literature?  (In a world of half-starved adjunct
professors and non-English speaking reader-students - the only lovable ones!)

Every writer confronts his or her OWN illiteracy.  (How to read "unrefined"
experience?)  Every word is a dictionary entry followed by... blank.

Every writer writes for the NON-artistic world - the world of our parents:
in which the "free word" of literature, on which nothing depends, is
sacrificed to the "functional" word, the word in harness, the directions
in the backhoe manual.  That forsaken world where language (and our parents)
have been humbled. And carved in stone.

Literature learns how to litter a tree.  And you want to become the tree.
You can't become the tree unless you are food for the soil.  The key
is in your own missing words.  The words for what you don't understand:
what happened yesterday. Your life in the world of illiterate action (i.e.
silence).  The Great American Shovel. (Dig up a story.)

I'm sure these musings will be of practical value to Tim Wood & everyone!!

MIME-Version: 1.0

My favorite bad poet is myself.  My favorite terrible poet used to be
Berrigan, but then I realized he was a great poet.  My favorite mediocre
poet is Auden, but only when he is truly mediocre, when he is bad I don't
like him and when he is great then he is not a mediocre poet. My least
favorite great poet is Pound, but only when he is great, when he is bad I
like him and when he is mediocre I am indifferent to him.  My favorite
pretty good poet is Kenneth Koch, except when he is great and then he is
one of my favorite great poets. When he is bad he is still Kenneth Koch.

Doesn't this sum it up pretty much?  What I like about Berrigan is the
sense of being given permission to be a poet; his capaciousness and
generosity of taste is part of this, and I'm glad to see the list is
generous to him, as I'm trying to catch up with the 95 posts I missed over
the weekend being away from my computer.  Wow!!

I've always enjoyed Joe Brainard's drawings, and I notice that the sonnets
are dedicated to him. Does anyone have any recent news of him. I assume he
is alive and well?

Hello all,

Thanks for your messages of support for the Kootenay School. They are
much appreciated.

The address of the Kootenay School is:
The Kootenay School,
112 West Hastings Street,
Vancouver BC
V6B 1G8  [v6b 1g8] CANADA

** note of US $ cheques : Because the School has no US$ bank account and
exchange and bank charges will be heavy on small cheques, US$
cheques/checks should be made out RADDLE MOON and flagged "for KSW" on
the memo line. RM will deposit them in our US$ account and pay KSW the
exchange on the amount from our Cdn$ chequing account. These cheques can
be sent to RM at 518-350 East Second Avenue, Vancouver, BC V5T 4R8 or to
the School.

.... Otherwise: money orders or book donations [thanks, Miekal] can be
sent directly to the School.

Letters of support are also welcome. Writers of letters should please
remember that the mandate of the City of Vancouver is to look out for
**local** orgs and audiences, and should slant their letters
accordingly. To say that Vancouver is internationally renown as a centre
for leading edge [buzz words are fine in bureaucratic circles!] poetries
is good but better to say what this might mean for the city, and for
local audiences.... Not to put words in anyone's mouth.

Letters should be addressed to :

Beverly Yahp
City of Vancouver
Office of Cultural Affairs
250 West Heritage Bldg City Sqare, Box 96,
555 West 12th Avenue
Vancouver BC
V5Z 3X7 CANADA

with cc: KSW at the address above for safety's sake [misfiling and all,
you know]. Or email [second best option] the school at ksw@radiant.net
and we can print out and fwd.

Thanks again for your support -- apologies for any duplication of
Charles' post which I haven't read completely [have been out of town for
a couple of days and am wading through email backlog] I wanted to get
the address to those people asking.

Please email me if you have questions.

good wishes,

Susan

dear listpeople

i've been thinking abt. metaphor as a(n) '(as)socia(tiona)l force' in
(political) poetry, & also abt. a (healthy)
poststructuralist skepticism that extinguishes the fire of/
turns off the ignition on/ & derails the vehicle, metaphor.

Was wondering if any of you all had thoughts, or could point me
to some recent essays on a-metaphorical carrying over, which also
deal directly with the absence of metaphor

thx.

I'd just like to second Charles' suggestion that letters be sent to City
Councillors -- perhaps with copies of letters to the City's Cultural
office [their address in my first note].

well this may not be what yr looking for, and it's kinda old hat too, but
in the 80s poststructuralist crit metaphor seemed to be in decline in
popularity and metonymy on the rise; metaphor was said to be a
mystification while metonymy revealed the relations that connected the
twoterms; metaphor was "mystical" while metonymy was "historical," etc.
This preoccupation and devaluing of metaphor seems to have abated in the
90s, see intro to Apex of M 1,for example, though it's still kicking around.

Henry,

You've always got a wonderful way of putting things.  Even better because
the semi-readerly writters of backhoe manuals probably not follow it, let
all think it practical.

The metaphor/metonymy opposition comes from Jakobson via Lacan and
deconstruction. As Maria points out, it had a lot of play in the 1980s. I
remember a lot of things like metaphor is modern and metonymy is
postmodern also. There was a whole sort of tropological approach to
poetry--remember all those essays about catachresis? I read a book trying
to demonstrate the chiasmus was the central trope of lyric poetry. A lot
of this has died out or been played out to its logical conclusion.  I
don't see a lot of point in seeing metaphor as the opposite of any other
trope, kind of like seeing cats as the opposite of dogs or oranges from
apples or men from women.  The Jakobson essay could be looked at with a
cold hard eye, in my view:  for example, I don't see that metonymy (this
spelling looks wrong to me) is syntactic and horizontal.  If I say "tin
pan alley"  instead of "popular songwriting of the 1920s" I am
substituting one expression for another, not linking the two expressions
syntactically.  Jakobson bases his opposition on brain-impairment,
aphasia.  But some of this metomymies aren't really that:  for example one
aphasiac said knife instead of fork, but this is not a good example of
metonymy in my book.

Sorry to be so pedantic so early in the morning.

Wallace Stevens has some interesting poems about metaphoracity, such as
the motive for metaphor.  Also along these lines William Bronk, perhaps.

I made the trip down to NYC from Albany last friday night to meet a friend
and see Amiri Baraka's reading at the Dia Center for the arts.  I heard him
read in Chicago a couple years ago but the sound was bad and the trumpet
was loud and Baraka could barely be heard.

The friend that invited me didn't say that Jayne Cortez was also reading
friday, and it was a damn good thing because Baraka was apparently stuck in
traffic all night and never showed.

But Cortez was incredible!  I don't know if I've ever seen a reading where
the audience responded so enthusiastically, and where the poet was so
moving.  There was so much music and rhythm, politics, anger, celebration,
power, intellect....  I had to drive back to Albany friday night, arrived
about two in the morning with so much energy left I couldn't sleep right
away.

They sold every copy of her book before the reading was over, I ordered
from Amazon.  Her latest book is _Somewhere in Adavance of Nowhere_, High
Risk Books.

I would like to announce (and open the topic up discussion, if anyone wants to
talk about distance learning, online workshopping, & related) my first formal
poetry writing workshop ever, through UCLA Extension.  Rather leadenly called
"Introduction to Poetry Writing:  Workshop (Online)", the course will be
nothing like the course description, which is trite and humiliating.

UCLA Extension Online Courses
http://unex.ucla.edu/on_line.htm

It's a straightforward workshop, based on participant work and critique of
same, no assignments except for the stuck, but a weekly poem deadline.  This
quarter (UCLA is on a quarter system), we will be using modern poetry written
in English as "examples".  Summer quarters will feature post WWII and
contemporary poets, respectively.  How did I arrive at the reading list?  Ten
a term from the list of poets writing in English I expect any poet to have
read.

As you know, there is the Alien Flower Poetry Workshop Online, there are
service provider workshops (I'm a mentor through AOL, but they offer some $40
workshops), etc.  My course is the beginning of what I hope will become a
second series of accredited online workshops (the first is at New School).
The reason to take one of mine would be that you are isolated, in the
country/on the road or at a school with no writing workshops, and want to
pursue undergrad writing or a writing certificate.  You would want something
serious and fun, to practice poetry writing with an audience without resorting
to a lot of nonsense about creative activity.

UCLA Writers Program
http://unex.ucla.edu/certprgms/writers/homepage.htm

The reason I'm teaching this is that I'm an intranet/extranet developer with
an MFA.  While I don't have a book published, I have more than 70 individual
poems published, including some at these locations online:  Agnieszka's Dowry
(http://www.enteract.com/~asgp/agd-poems/jar8.html), ECLECTICA Magazine
Archives (http://www2.polarnet.com/~eclectic/archives.html), etc.

I can't help but think that this list is overly preoccupied with dead poets.
That's pretty safe.

Meanwhile, metaphor is like sex: there is always leakage.

"Let's not discuss him, he's dead." In my mind I don't really make the
distinction, I guess. I was thinking of R. Silliman's essay "New Hope for
the Disappeared," in which he talks of how fast we forget about poets; his
examples were Ceravolo and Lew Welch--I can add Joe Brainard to the list
now much to my chagrin.     If the point is that we should be discussing
poets While they are still alive  then I couldn't agree more.

=93HILDA MORLEY
b. 1919
Born in New York City and educated there and in Haifa, Israel, London,=0A=

lay did=0Anot begin to publish her poems in any number until the death of=
 her husband,=0Acomposer Stefan Wolpe, in 1971; since then her work has a=
ppeared widely.
Her first major collection, *What Are Winds & What Are Waters=94 (1983), =
is a=0Abooklength threnody for Wolpe.  In the preface, Denise Levertov wr=
ites, =93her=0Apoetry so truly (and intuitively, I think) manifests the r=

Rosmarie Waldrop speaks to this in her essay, "Form and Discontent," in
the fall/winter '96 issue of Diacritics. She speaks, among many other
things, of Olson referring to the vertical tendency of metaphor as "the
suck of symbol." Waldrop: "Metaphor as a hotline to transcendence, to
divine meaning, which casts the poet in the role of a special being, a
priest or prophet." In short, Romanticism. On metonymy: "composition and
syntax," "stess on how the elements were combined on the surface, how they
sat next to each other on the page, how they followed each other in the
theater." Or, "the Neoclassical aesthetic."

Metaphors: hotline, casts in the role, sat next to each other, theater
Metonymy: priest?, prophet?

Metaphors 4
Metonymy 2

or is it?

Metaphors 6
Metonymy 0

metonymy: the Red Sox of the Trope Major leagues

I don't see any point in dramatizing this metaphor vs metonymy thing. They
are both basic, essential elements of ALL LANGUAGE [sorry poets, ALL
LANGUAGE]. Metaphor has to do with paradigmatic relations, metonymy with
syntagmatic relations.

Take away this set of relations and you deprive yourselves of a significant
tool for understanding how the mind works, how ALL MINDS WORK [not just
poetic minds].

This is not a matter of politics or poetics.

Re Berrigan/Watten. Don't know anything about the MFA thesis but the his piece
in Aerial 8 is genuinely appreciative. Also, the reading of The Sonnets,
Complete, at 80 Langton is possibly the single greatest poetry reading I've

I agree with George Thompson, with the rider that whenever there is
invention of language, that is what is meant by poesis. It isnt always done
by demarcated-off _poets_ , but they have made it their business to
preserve such innovation and to create as 'twere websites where such
generative play keeps us conscious of precisely that which George indicates
in his post. David

I also agree with George Thompson.  I think Rosmarie Waldrop's piece is only
one among a great many which used this opposition to defend (sort of
after-the-fact) the whole stream of open, experimental, documentary
poetics stemming mainly from Pound, and also to support what is seen as
a feminist, secular, "anti-logocentric" worldview.  It is a simple fact
that 20th century poetry explores whole new regions via metonymy, parataxis,
and collage, so it is understandable that people would remark on the
special resources of these aspects of language use. But this idea that
metaphor rather than metonymy can be put to vatic, religious use - that one
is sacred, the other secular - is there any evidence of this?
Or is Waldrop's real target the attempt to provide any single, stable
"meaning" in poetry?

The Russian Formalists sort of codified these two axes of composition
in poetry, and various poets have been drawn to their theories
for technical explanations of what they're doing.  As I've said
before here & have tried to point out in a couple web essays (in
Mudlark & in a response to Joe Brennan in Flashpoint), I prefer the
theories of one of the Formalists' percursors and antagonists, A.
Potebnia.  Potebnia emphasized that words have an "inner form" or
"inner image" - psychological, etymological, symbolic.  Actually not
a single image - words are concentrated sources, via this inner form,
of infinite meanings.  Poetry is not analyzable simply on a R. Formalist
grid or axis of metaphor/metonymy, because the inner form of the word
per se is always generating new clusters of meaning & effect.  Potebnia
as you might guess shows some kinship with the ideas of Annensky and
Mandelstam, in particular.

I'm not a scholar myself & admit these are hunches rather
than researches, but they're useful orientations for me anyway.

I agree that metonymy should have no privilege over metaphor and that
both are parts of all languages. What I found interesting in the Waldrop
quotes that I provided was that she couldn't get away from using
metaphors. And who can? Or would want to? I remember about 25 years ago, I
vowed to rid my writing of all metaphor. I'm not sure why. I think I
thought of metaphors as being somehow "false." Well, this project didn't
last long. I soon realized that common, everyday words themselves were
metaphors. For example, "metaphor," which comes from roots meaning change
and to bear. I always had this image of an old man carrying bundles of
similarities across a bridge from one word to another. Still, this all
said, I still wonder why language is this way. Could it have gone another
route? I suppose these are more anthropological questions than political
ones, although that line has to be blurry at some point as well. Maybe
they are even physiological questions. Some researchers believe we
developed speech because we, as a species, are predominately right-handed.
Thus, we used the left side of our brain for picking fruits, nabbing grubs
and just generally hanging around. This freed the right side of our brain
to do what it does best -- speech. Can we blame it all on a gene that
decided to favor right-handedness? What if it had decided left-handedness?
Or split right down the middle?

I certainly agree that I wouldn't want to get rid of metaphor, & its a
mistake, I think, to associate it primarily, immediately, etc, with
poetry.  There's almost no vernacular expression which doesn't include it.
Zora Neale Hurston's fascinating essay, "Characteristics of Negro
Expression," has some great examples of how metaphor and simile gets
employed in African-American vernacular English.  My favorites: "One at a
time, like lawyers going to heaven;" "I'll beat you till you smell like
onions;" calling deceivers "cloakers," and Molasses "mule blood," this
latter being a fine example of the way metaphor can act, not to transcend
but to do precisely the opposite, bring thing back down to earth,
materiality, production, politics.  -m.

I like Vico's idea that nabbing grubs & speech are basically THE SAME activity.
That writing came before speech because the 1st speech ("grasping") was
gesture - which became drawing - which became writing - which eventually
became verbal "signs".  - Henry G.(definitely lefthanded)

I'm left-handed! And yes, so were all of the possible presidents you
listed, Chris--

Of note: Though language "resides" in the right hemisphere as a general
rule--this residence is split in left-handers (like a summer house and
winter house)--

When left-handed people have strokes or other maladies that cause aphasia,
they have a far better chance of retaining their linguistic abilities (as
aphasias generally mess with one side or the other)--

Jonathan,
Why don't you think knife for fork is a good example of metonymy?

Waldrop's equation of metonymy with the neoclassical aesthetic surprises me
since I can just as easily think of  metaphor used in a cool and witty way
to take emotion out of things by unexpected analogies (as in Pope) and
metonymy as a manifestation of the heated romantic mind's wandering
openness to synchronistic suggestions of meaning through juxtaposition (as
in Ode to a Nightingale).

Linda--another tip--I think there is an essay by Hayden Carruth from the
mid-80's callled something like "Against Metaphor," explaining why he
thought poems were better without it, which might be a good document of the
80's turn if that interests you.

Thanks for the inspiring report on Cortez!

Annie

Subject: pomo metaphoracity

The metaphor/metonymy opposition comes from Jakobson via Lacan and
deconstruction. As Maria points out, it had a lot of play in the 1980s. I
remember a lot of things like metaphor is modern and metonymy is
postmodern also. There was a whole sort of tropological approach to
poetry--remember all those essays about catachresis? I read a book trying
to demonstrate the chiasmus was the central trope of lyric poetry. A lot
of this has died out or been played out to its logical conclusion.  I
don't see a lot of point in seeing metaphor as the opposite of any other
trope, kind of like seeing cats as the opposite of dogs or oranges from
apples or men from women.  The Jakobson essay could be looked at with a
cold hard eye, in my view:  for example, I don't see that metonymy (this
spelling looks wrong to me) is syntactic and horizontal.  If I say "tin
pan alley"  instead of "popular songwriting of the 1920s" I am
substituting one expression for another, not linking the two expressions
syntactically.  Jakobson bases his opposition on brain-impairment,
aphasia.  But some of this metomymies aren't really that:  for example one
aphasiac said knife instead of fork, but this is not a good example of
metonymy in my book.

Sorry to be so pedantic so early in the morning.

Wallace Stevens has some interesting poems about metaphoracity, such as
the motive for metaphor.  Also along these lines William Bronk, perhaps.

Why is not knife for fork a good metonymy?  My reasoning is as follows:
metonymies and synechdoches are usually things like part for whole, whole
for part, container for thing contained, cause for effect, effect for
cause, etc...  That is there is a connection between the two things, one
substituted for another. The work "contiguity," sometimes used to describe
metonymy, is misleading, because it leads Jakobson to think that "thing
lying next to another thing" is a metonymy. Bacon would not be a good
metonymy for eggs, for example, though it could stand in for food in
general or for breakfast.  The test would be if you could understand the
substitution instantly. Metonymy is usually highly conventional. If
someone said knife meaning fork we would be confused.

This is perhaps a pedantic distinction.

That's called ambidexterity.  Your right hand "holds up" your brain while your
left hand tries to right what's wrong with you.  Just look in the mirror.
You'll see naem I tahw.  Righty hold-up.  Lefty quick on the draw.

I'm ambidextrous, which is the only thing I have in common with Bill Gates
and Ken Griffey, Jr.  Would that!  I do notice that poets and athletes
tend toward the sinister side.  (This is _not_ to say that Gates is a
poet, which my parallel structure is doing to me here.)

Jonathan Mayhew's distinction is interesting, but I'm not sure I understand
metonymy in the same way. I would have thought that metaphor is more
typically conventional than metonymy is [and maybe that's why pomo's
started opting for metonymy? -- that's just a guess, I don't know]. Fork
for knife seems like a good example of metonymy for me, even if it is
confusing.

When I was a kid I hated it when my tottering old grandfather would call me
by my brother's name. He also had a habit of mixing up the names of all my
aunts and uncles [his own children]. A little confusing, I suppose, but
basically we all understood what he meant. It was metonymy, no?

The contiguity relation is interesting. A footprint is a metonymy, a sign
of the creature who left it there in the sand [think of Robinson Crusoe's
first encounter with Friday's footprints].

I hope that I am not being too simple here, because I agree with Jonathan
that things can get rather complicated. I was once in a classroom teaching
the difference between metaphor and metonymy. As an example of the latter I
found myself referring to a murder scene from, I think, one of the
Godfather movies. Some gangster types sitting at a restaurant table, one of
them smoking a cigarette. The hit man bursts in, all hell breaks loose,
blood everywhere, bodies draped all over the place. Cut to the cigarette
sitting quietly in the ash tray. Hold on it for some fifteen seconds. A
typical scene we've seen over and over again I suppose [conventional?].

What's with the cigarette? I asked, hoping to get the students to see the
relationship between the cigarette and the dead man, who moments ago had
held it to his lips [contiguity]. Well, they got the metonymy thing right
away. But they kept on going. It was also metaphorical, they insisted. They
showed me in fact that there was a kind of Homeric metaphor here about the
length of a man's [a gangster's] days being analogous to the length of a
cigarette's very short day. Metaphor. Interesting discussion about smoke as
spirit, transience of spirit, of life, of consciousness, etc. [this was
before Paul Auster's movie 'Smoke", BTW].  We finally came to the
collective conclusion that the fifteen second hold on the ashtray may have
begun as a metonymy but it surely ended as a metaphor.

This experience drove home the point, often made in the literature on these
terms, that while separating them out in theory is useful, in practice it
is hard to keep them apart.

Sorry if this is long-winded. Something got into me.

It's a terrible thing for KSW not to get that grant.  It's a vital space for a
bunch of hard working free-radically inclined good folks.

What can we do?  During my recent trip there I did hear that certain items
were for sale and that they are gorgeous.  All real looking.  Good enough to
fool any corporate HR manager or academic dean.  They are KSW sheepskins.

The following KSW degrees are still available:

BA : a dime a dozen plus $10 for photocopying
Hons BA: $15
MA : $2n
PhD : $50
Honorary PhD : $100

I'm going for the Phd myself and I urge you all to do so as well.  And I'll
give you a tip on how to use it since I'm such a generous guy (I hear there's
an opening at Temple).

Send away for your degree today at the address indicated below.

Hello all,

Thanks for your messages of support for the Kootenay School. They are
much appreciated.

The address of the Kootenay School is:
The Kootenay School,
112 West Hastings Street,
Vancouver BC
V6B 1G8  [v6b 1g8] CANADA

** note of US $ cheques : Because the School has no US$ bank account and
exchange and bank charges will be heavy on small cheques, US$
cheques/checks should be made out RADDLE MOON and flagged "for KSW" on
the memo line. RM will deposit them in our US$ account and pay KSW the
exchange on the amount from our Cdn$ chequing account. These cheques can
be sent to RM at 518-350 East Second Avenue, Vancouver, BC V5T 4R8 or to
the School.

.... Otherwise: money orders or book donations [thanks, Miekal] can be
sent directly to the School.

Letters of support are also welcome. Writers of letters should please
remember that the mandate of the City of Vancouver is to look out for
**local** orgs and audiences, and should slant their letters
accordingly. To say that Vancouver is internationally renown as a centre
for leading edge [buzz words are fine in bureaucratic circles!] poetries
is good but better to say what this might mean for the city, and for
local audiences.... Not to put words in anyone's mouth.

Hey there listservfolks in quiet listcountry, another of our very own has a

        George's point points to a belief I've long held, that is that,
Metonymy, by virtue of its drifting into Metaphor consistently in
practice, is a sub-set of Metaphor, like the simile.  Get it?

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I suppose my definition (of metonymy)  is more classically based, that is
based on actual metonomies used in language.  These are mostly
conventional, e.g.:

"the suits"  for the upper management  (clothing for the men wearing it)
"wall street" for the financial industry (place for the activity there)
"thirty sails"  for thirty ships (part for whole [synechdoche])
"I drank two glasses"  (container for thing contained, material for object
made of this material)
"the pentagon"   (shape for building made in this shape, building for
department housed there)
"Hey, slim"   (characteristic of person in place of person's name)

etc...

The use of the word metonymy to refer to a narrative detail (a character's
cigarette) is the result of a wider application of the term in Jakobson's
essay and the  influence of this essay  on literary critics.  Jakobson's
contention that realist novels were metonymical, for example, did not mean
necessarily that there were filled with the figure of metonymy, but that
they work in a way ANALOGOUS to metonymy, by exploiting relations of
contiguity.  This, I would contend, is a metaphorical extension of the
original concept of metonymy as a trope--though a metaphorical extension
that has gained wide acceptance, so much acceptance that I don't think
it wise to press the point.  I don't believe that metonymy is a
syntagmatic operation, however; this is also a metaphorization of the
figure of metonymy (one word is connected to another word just as a knife
is lying next to a fork).

metonymy ="a naming instead,"  substituting a noun for some other noun or
adjective connected to it in some way.

Lefties write good poetry, but never the poetry of old age.
A psych prof at UBC for years attended readings at the Kootenay
School, noticed the absence of aged lefties, then published
his research proving that lefties die young.  Sophocles, a righty,
wrote that to have been born leftie was next best to never
having been born.

Not only that (and the discovery was made at McGill Univ., by the way), but
right-handed people from left-handed families have a better chance that
ordinary righthanders, though not as good as lefthanders. Fortunately, my
sister, my brother and my daughter are lefthanded. My wife also comes from
a lefthanded family, though she is righthanded.

Roy Miki the poet/critic is lefthanded.

It's been awhile since I've read Jakobson on metaphor/metonymy, but I
recall a comment to the effect that metonymy yielded less easily to
analysis.  Metonymy has always seemed the slippery trope, less
"conventional: perhaps than metaphor.  But as others have pointed out,
making distinctions in actual usage is difficult--the cigarette example
from George Thompson, for example, seems to me to function as both
metaphor and metonym.  I recall analyzing a number of Edward Taylor's
religious poems this way--to unpack many of the images, one had to
look at them metaphorically (often the leap from secular to spiritual) and
metonymically (once he got to the spritual level, he could substitute
freely, often metonymically, there).  The images sound irrational at first
(the only example I can think of offhand, amd its been a very long time
since I've read these poems) is "wicker cage of rusted wire" to refer to
the mortal body.  I see metaphor there, in the substitution of cage for
body which holds the soul, but wicker and wire is not a methaphorical
substitution, and seems to me a metomyn, though not a conventional one
(part for whole, container for thing contained, etc).  Like substituting
"knife" for "fork" . . .?

        It's like many of us share the same firm of attorneys. Mark Baker's
post worries me, though. In my sixties, mainly a leftie, & still trying to
write? who am I fooling? On the other hand (groan), it's only this one UBC
professor says so. I took psych at UBC and they lost my final -- gues their
left hand didnt know what their right hand was doing! It was lucky for me :
they had to give me a passing grade (just 50%), but it was a saturday a.m.
class which I hardly ever made, (btw, the only person I knew whose notes I
could borrow was also, I believe, a leftie) so I would likely have failed,
had they found it.

Like others who have testified, I can be ambidextrous, if you have the time
to spare.

Other leftie writers I've noticed : Cydney Chadwick, Cole Swensen. I used
to have memorized dozens more, but the names are wandering through the
blackberry patches in one of the lobes of my brain, browsing but hidden
from view. My father was born a leftie, but it was the 19th C and he was
beaten until he surrendered. He had admirable, copperplate handwriting
with, of course, his right hand. (But he dealt cards with the left). My
wife is a leftie, so natch our daughter is. We guys should team up and
demand some rights (ouch). Back in the liberal 70s, we all of a sudden had
lefthanded chair armrests for LH notetakers. By the Reagan era, these had
all vanished. Stolen by LH students? I doubt it. Stowed on campus
somewhere, taking up space but preventing Sonoma State from being thought
bleeding heart? We should all lean on Bill for some breaks while he can
still sign something official with his left hand.

While it's really interesting to me to learn who is and who isnt, I feel a
bit frivolous when so much heavy stuff is going down. The McCaffery news
was exhausting, not the least for being like a saturday matinee for kids,
with evil Temple being foiled at the last minute by noble York--thanks to
the perspicacity of our hero. I am so glad for Steve that that deal came
through, and I echo Doug Barbour's sentiments re-its being good for Canada
in general and Toronto in particular. But still, a huge disappointment for
people in Philly. And what a way to treat a genius! Or any human being.

News re the Kootenay School is sad and frustrating also; lets hope there
can be a happy ending there. I'm writing my letters tonight, Charles Watts;
good to see your energy on the List. I dont know whether the KSW is still
able to grant advanced degrees for a consideration; as I recall, a
doctorate cost CAN$50. I myself would like an Hon. D. Litt. Also, I refer
KSWers to my repeated posts about yard sales as sources of funds for such
organizations. If writing to city council persons (too bad Jenny Shaw didnt
win election to that body!), shouldnt one suggest that all one has heard
about their fair city has made it likely that one will shortly be
re-locating thither? And in due course, voting there?

I heard that lefties are more literal-minded than the other camp. Seems to
me there's a part missing in that rumor. But what is it makes one
susceptible to the possibility of nonsense turning meaningful? E.g. If
youre knife to me, we can have a spoon and maybe even a fork. Is that a
syntagmic chain?

 Charles Simic has a fine poem about a fork. I think it's in _Dismantling
the Silence_ .    Oh, is that the time? Must dash-- David .

I once worked in a company where the whole art department and a lot of
the editorial department -- most of them poets -- were left-handed.

So, register me -- the only left-hander in my family [when it's not
genetic it's birth trauma they say] and Michael Gregson (Cdn
mock-epicist), Lewis Carroll, Jean Genet and Pres.s Gerald Ford, Hoover
and Garfield, too, if I remember correctly -- scary, isn't it? a
sinisterly run country to be sure... (Harry Truman wrote right-handed
but threw southpaw)

Keep the KSW support coming: the lives of untold birth-traumatized
maladroit poets are at stake.

Okay, I've just added another box to my survey at Comprepoetica, for
handedness.  NOW will you guys send me biographical information?

Actually, I DO think the handedness, eye-color, height, etc., of people
in various vocations are interesting.  I wonder if there's a difference
in handedness between lonaguage poets and mainstream poets, or between
language poets and visual poets, or between visual and mainstream poets.
Or between literary critics and poets.

I'm right-handed, by the way.

I'd say rather that there's a fractional dimension between metaphor and metonymy
-- i.e., that either one of these terms is always (?) encountered in the process
of being folded over into the other. Jakobson is actually quite suggestive on
this, and much less rigidly schematic than many current "readings" give him
credit for:


". . . the new doctrine rejects the absolute character of time, and therefore
the existence of 'world' time as well. Every identical self-moving system has
its own time; the speed of time-flow is not identical in each system"
("Futurism").

[Contiguity (i.e., the temporal series) becomes substitution -- one can name and
know the "self-moving system" as a characterizable whole. This, in turn depends
upon the (metonymic) serialization of  a range of such systems, articulated
against the (again metaphoric) totality of "world" time.]



". . . shifting and change are not only historical statements . . . but . . .
shift is also a directly experienced synchronic pheonmenon, a relevant artistic
value" ("The Dominant").



"What is the empirical linguistic criterion of the poetic function? . . . To
answer this question we must recall the two basic modes of arrangement used in
verbal behavior, selection and combination. . . . [S]election is produced on the
basis of equivalence, similarity and dissimilarity, synonymy and antonymy, while
the combination, the build-up of the sequence, is based on contiguity. The
poetic function projects the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection
into the axis of combination. Equivalence is promoted to the constitutive device
of the sequence" ("Linguistics and Poetics").

[Both the becoming-metaphor of metonymy, and the becoming-metonymy of metaphor.
Of course, this is a matter of the "poetic function," so one might argue that
this disposition of linguistic space around two dimensions (Jakobson frequently
refers to the metonymic axis as "horizontal" and the metaphoric as "vertical")
and the fraction of a third in which these integer dimensions fold / evolve /
involve toward each other -- (long sentence) that this disposition is simply a
matter of aesthetic distance from or distortion of everyday language. I'd argue,
myself, that the "poetic function" is at least as much a matter of reading as it
is the aesthetic intent of a writer.]



". . . a linguist deaf to the poetic function of language and a literary scholar
indifferent to linguistic problems and unconversant with linguistic methods are
equally flagrant anachronisms" (ibid).

[Here Jakobson seems to allow for the possibility of what I've written above. In
other words, the sort of absolute distinction between poetic and everyday
language which is the result of a certain canonical reading of Jakobson's work
might be itself simply the product of a too-stringent disciplinarity -- one
which Jakobson himself felt (in 1958) to be already obsolete. This is not
necessarily an attempt to liquidate the difference between, say, poetry and
headlines (though one might read Shklovsky for productive suggestions in this
direction), but more the claim that such differences are not so categorical as
we might think, depending for their maintenance on more "conjunctural" (or even
conjectural) complexes of attention and intention on the part of writers and
readers (and publishers and printers, etc.). This understanding of linguistic
space as 2.n-dimensional -- a space of partial differences and partial
correspondences -- allows one to envision a possibility for the work of verbal
art other than that of the "conduit metaphor" which Jakobson himself finally and
infamously gives himself over to. (For better critiques of this organizing
metaphor than mine, see Barrett Watten, "The Conduit of Communication in
Everyday Life" (Aerial 8), and Michael Reddy, "The Conduit Metaphor," cited
therein). Rather than the two-dimensional narrative of composition -- i.e., the
poet converts a (metonymic) historical / factical time-sequence into a
(metaphoric) literary artifact, which is then metonymically "unpacked" into a
reader's physical and historical time of reading -- one arrives at a sense of
language-objects which are always already cross-cut by time, which is itself
scored with / by words. Vertiginous and often frightening, but (I think) better
suited to an accurate sense of what poetry -- both as and as apart from language
-- might do. Sadly, I'd count myself among the population of the second half of
Jakobson's anachronism -- not indifferent, but certainly unconversant].

To vastly oversimplify, one might read "language" or even "life" for "poetry" in
the following passage, also from "Linguistics and Poetics":


". . . anything sequent is a simile. In poetry, where similarity is superinduced

I'd say rather that there's a fractional dimension between metaphor and
metonymy -- i.e., that either one of these terms is always (?) encountered
in the process of being folded over into the other. Jakobson is actually
quite suggestive on this, and much less rigidly schematic than many current
"readings" give him credit for:
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>". . . the new doctrine rejects the absolute character of time, and
therefore the existence of 'world' time as well. Every identical self-moving
system has its own time; the speed of time-flow is not identical in each
system" ("Futurism").

<P>[Contiguity (i.e., the temporal series) becomes substitution -- one
can name and know the "self-moving system" as a characterizable whole.
This, in turn depends upon the (metonymic) serialization of&nbsp; a range
of such systems, articulated against the (again metaphoric) totality of
"world" time.]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>". . . shifting and change are not only historical statements . . .
but . . . shift is also a directly experienced synchronic pheonmenon, a
relevant artistic value" ("The Dominant").
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is the empirical linguistic criterion of the poetic function?
. . . To answer this question we must recall the two basic modes of arrangement
used in verbal behavior, <I>selection</I> and <I>combination. . . . </I>[S]election
is produced on the basis of equivalence, similarity and dissimilarity,
synonymy and antonymy, while the combination, the build-up of the sequence,
is based on contiguity. <I>The poetic function projects the principle of
equivalence from the axis of selection into the axis of combination. </I>Equivalence
is promoted to the constitutive device of the sequence" ("Linguistics and
Poetics").

<P>[Both the becoming-metaphor of metonymy, and the becoming-metonymy of
metaphor. Of course, this is a matter of the "poetic function," so one
might argue that this disposition of linguistic space around two dimensions
(Jakobson frequently refers to the metonymic axis as "horizontal" and the
metaphoric as "vertical") and the fraction of a third in which these integer
dimensions fold / evolve / involve toward each other -- (long sentence)
that this disposition is simply a matter of aesthetic distance from or
distortion of everyday language. I'd argue, myself, that the "poetic function"
is at least as much a matter of reading as it is the aesthetic intent of
a writer.]
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>". . . a linguist deaf to the poetic function of language and a literary
scholar indifferent to linguistic problems and unconversant with linguistic
methods are equally flagrant anachronisms" (<I>ibid</I>).

<P>[Here Jakobson seems to allow for the possibility of what I've written
above. In other words, the sort of absolute distinction between poetic
and everyday language which is the result of a certain canonical reading
of Jakobson's work might be itself simply the product of a too-stringent
disciplinarity -- one which Jakobson himself felt (in 1958) to be already
obsolete. This is not necessarily an attempt to liquidate the difference
between, say, poetry and headlines (though one might read Shklovsky for
productive suggestions in this direction), but more the claim that such
differences are not so categorical as we might think, depending for their
maintenance on more "conjunctural" (or even conjectural) complexes of attention
and intention on the part of writers <I>and</I> readers (<I>and</I> publishers
<I>and</I> printers, etc.). This understanding of linguistic space as 2.<I>n</I>-dimensional
-- a space of partial differences and partial correspondences -- allows
one to envision a possibility for the work of verbal art other than that
of the "conduit metaphor" which Jakobson himself finally and infamously
gives himself over to. (For better critiques of this organizing metaphor
than mine, see Barrett Watten, "The Conduit of Communication in Everyday
Life" (<I>Aerial </I>8), and Michael Reddy, "The Conduit Metaphor," cited
therein). Rather than the two-dimensional narrative of composition -- i.e.,
the poet converts a (metonymic) historical / factical time-sequence into
a (metaphoric) literary artifact, which is then metonymically "unpacked"
into a reader's physical and historical time of reading -- one arrives
at a sense of language-objects which are always already cross-cut by time,
which is itself scored with / by words. Vertiginous and often frightening,
but (I think) better suited to an accurate sense of what poetry -- both
<I>as</I> and <I>as apart from </I>language -- might do. Sadly, I'd count
myself among the population of the second half of Jakobson's anachronism
-- not indifferent, but certainly unconversant].

<P>To vastly oversimplify, one might read "language" or even "life" for
"poetry" in the following passage, also from "Linguistics and Poetics":
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>". . . anything sequent is a simile. In poetry, where similarity is
superinduced upon contiguity, any metonymy is slightly metaphoric and any
metaphor has a metonymic tint."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A final tangent: I seem to remember reading something in which various

I've asked this before here without much response so i'll ask again.  What
does 'parataxis' mean in literary circles?  Psychologically it has a sense
that i think is now pretty much limited to Harry Sullivan's works where it
means prelogical or non-verbal action tendencies.  It could, by extension,
be applied in other 'systems' but I like the more delimited formulation
and i think it works better in that framework.

some off the cuff meditations:

parataxis (rhetorically a figure of speech) used to describe paratactic
verbal constructions and opposed to normative subject predicate syntax
such as "man sees horse." Examples include series of phrases, marked by
repetiton and variation (parallelisms, coordination); read by pattern
recognition, analyzed by classification rather than by qualification,
modification, subordination; often thought of as non-hierarchical,
except that series nest within series. Best ready example Whitman.

one truism: paratactic constructions, like chants appeal to the
emotions; syntactic to reason, rationality

elements within a paratactic structure can be syntatcatically complete:
"caldorn boil"

but "caldron boil and caldron bubble" is a highly marked example of
parataxis (marked by syntatctic parallelism, repetition, and assonance."

"the apparition of these faces in the crowd;
petal on a wet, black bough"

is a lightly marked, syntactically incomplete, example of parataxis. You
have the bare bones of a series; each untit syntactically dissimilar,
each unit marked by assonance in the musical phrase, arriving by
different routes at the strongly marked assonance (in parallel position)
of  the /ow/ and /ou/ sounds at th end of each line.

Tom Bell,

The Princeton Ency. of Poetry and Poetics sez:

"P. is a stylistic term referring to a relative paucity of linking terms
between juxtaposed clauses or sentences, often giving the effect of piling
up, swiftness, and sometimes compression. A paratactic style is one in
which a lang.'s ordinary resources for joining propositions are
deliberately underused..."

Interestingly, the definition includes an example from Pope's "Essay on
Criticism." To wit:

Pride, Malice, Folly against Dryden rose,
In various shapes of Parsons, Critics, Beaus

The Pr. Ency. says that the presence of "and" in the two lines would
prevent us from making both single pairs between the faults in line 1 and
the enemies in line 2 (Pride - Parsons) and between the two groups in
relationship to each other.

Now, I would even say that perhaps the pairings are metonymical.

What would you all say?

boy, this sure has drifted from my initial inquiry.  I'm aware of the
metaphor/metonymy distinction. Perhaps there is no answer to my q. as
there is no essay that tells me exactly what i want to know!  which
is (to rephrase)
I'm wondering if anyone's written abt. post-metaphoric
"political" poetry -- specifically abt. the absence of metaphor.

as John Berger writes in _A Painter of Our Time_ (and I paraphrase)
a poet Yannos used pigeons as a symbol of the revolutionaries' spirits after
they were slaughtered in a square when upon the gunshots  these pigeons
flew off the window sills where they routinely sat; John remarked they had
returned peacefully the next day, and said "the only image for man fighting is man"
[double sic]

it seems that some postmodern poetry disregards metaphor FOR
political reasons -- i'm wondering abt. this distinction.

In my view if you're writing poetry you're already involved in the power
structure.  And indirect or direct speech are EQUIVALENT techniques.
Indirect speech is often the most powerful.  It is someone saying
something too terrible to use words directly about.  The metaphor or
synecdoche or whatever only adds to the shock. Whereas in an (an)aesthetized
cultural situation "direct" speech SEEMS more "political".  The irony is
that those who think poetry is a political tool are the ones most comfortable
with the status quo, whether they realize it or not.  Those outside the
status quo use poetry politically in order to join the establishment.
And those REALLY outside the establishment - are totally outside poetry too.
- Edgar Allan Poe, Southern Gentleman

By way of bringing the metonymy/metaphor discussion more closely to bear on
individual verse passages, I'd like to point out how the knife = fork
metonymy operates in a specific literary application.  I'm reminded of that
timeless lyric, whose author, if known, I've forgotten (it isn't Ogden
Nash, is it?):

I eat my peas with honey:
I've done it all my life.
It may taste kind of funny,
But it keeps them on my knife.

Here, the knife would be a fork if "fork" rhymed with "life." Thus the
rhetorical function of metonymy, in this instance, doubles as a principle
of formal expedience. The end result (once we come to terms with the
problems of figurative categorization) is a frustration of the reader's
expectations that produces either a disturbing experience of lexical
slippage or an equally unsettling image of gustatory incompetence--or
rather, a radical flickering between both possible aesthetic fields, and
hence the GREATNESS of the poem.

Being the dense sort, when they put a pen or pencil or crayon into my right
hand, I used it there. It wasn't until around age seven, when (in the days
before mini-T-ball leagues) playing baseball with my dad's right-handed
glove I simply couldn't throw, so got into the habit of taking the glove off
first and then throwing (a la Jim Abbott, the one-handed pitcher) until I
could convince my folks to invest in a left-handed glove. When I tried
batting left-handed, suddenly I could hit, and in fact I now do all sports
as a leftie (even kick with my left foot). But I still write right-handed
and my pen-person-ship demonstrates for all to see that this is not a
"natural" mode.

One twin (Colin) is a lefty with a pen, tho a switch hitter. Jesse is
strictly a righty. I've been told that such a division is almost standard
with twins.

Count Erica Hunt among the lefties.

I am usually left handed, e.g., writing, scratching, daily tasks, knife
and fork using, etc.  when I went to Shanghai however I was not allowed
(I mean this literally) to use chopsticks with my left hand -- they would
be physically taken from my left hand and put into my right hand.  so the
only major task in which I am right handed is eating with chopsticks.  at
one point a friend was going to teach me calligraphy with a brush; he
said that I would have to do it with my right hand, otherwise the stroke
order would be wrong.  I decided not to learn to use the brush.

Not only Reagan, but also Attila the Hun, Benito Mussolini, Robert Bly,
and Collin Staplehurst (my butcher) were/are all lefties!  Could the
"sinister" conflation have a grain of truth!?!?!

With such overwhelming evidence perhaps someone should table a
motion to forcibly eject all lefties from this list on the grounds of gen=
eral
degeneracy.  Besides, who can understand them?

(I tried once, I really did, in 4th grade, to write with my left hand. =

Heather Bell, a girl whom neither my left nor my right brain had a crush
on, was ordered to write righty by our evil principle Mrs. Topsic.  She
cried for almost an hour until Topsic left, then she resumed lefty.  In =
a
show of solidarity I too tried to write lefty.  But alas my right brain
would not be ruled and what resulted was a significant degradation of my
already "N" for "needs-improvement" handwriting.  I gave up after a
day, Heather grew up and entered a convent, and Valley School didn't
catch my dyslexia until I was 15.  Does dyslexia count for anything?)

Apoplexically,

Bob,

Maybe you should add a box to your survey for cases like Steve's
friend?

Everyone else,

Since language and handedness are physiologically connected,
what effects might a forced switch to the right hand have had on
(for example) David Bromige's father?

Sound off: how many on this list are Adult Children of Repressed
Lefties?

(I'm serious about the forced switch question.)

while i suspect the answer could be construed to be yes, the most famous
example of this is not a postmodern one: Neruda i think, said something
like "the blood of the children ran in the streets like the blood of the
children ran in the streets."

when i teach my favorite example of parataxis is the "Old Testament,"
because many students are familiar w/ the style if not the detailed
contents thereof. then i move to stein, j bowles, etc.  erich auerbach, in
mimesis, has a chapter on the OT and how the parataxis (this and this and
this happened, rather than this caused this to happen, and then that in
turn caused a reaction, etc) creates a sense of timelessness or mythos
rather than a sense of a narrative developing through time.  gertrude said
that the OT shd a a model for "new American writing" (in 1935), and
auerbach's work is generally seen as a muted, if pointed, emphasis on the
importance of Jewish culture to European culture; he also was writing (in
exile) during WWII --so identitarian that i am, i tend to give this
particular lecture an ethnic spin, though of course it goes beyond that as
well.

Subject:      Re: metaphoracity redux
In-Reply-To:  Message of Wed, 11 Mar 1998 22:43:40 +0000 from
              <Linda.Russo@M.CC.UTAH.EDU>

In my view if you're writing poetry you're already involved in the power
structure.  And indirect or direct speech are EQUIVALENT techniques.
Indirect speech is often the most powerful.  It is someone saying
something too terrible to use words directly about.  The metaphor or
synecdoche or whatever only adds to the shock. Whereas in an (an)aesthetized
cultural situation "direct" speech SEEMS more "political".  The irony is
that those who think poetry is a political tool are the ones most comfortable
with the status quo, whether they realize it or not.  Those outside the
status quo use poetry politically in order to join the establishment.
And those REALLY outside the establishment - are totally outside poetry too.
- Edgar Allan Poe, Southern Gentleman

Edgar's being vague and simplistic here.  Making of poetry takes place on
more than one level.  There's the widespread impulse to make art, irrespective
of talent or social position.  It's a way of life and a gift economy.  Then
there's Literature as an economic activity and cultural institution.  Edgar
himself promoted the ideal of the Cosmopolitan, Aristocratic Man of Letters
and Genius as a literary or staged property (while the status of the
southern aristocracy and human "property" was in deep crisis) - the Author
vs. the Rabble.  This has been an abiding theme since the end of
feudalism, just about.  The question of common property or common good
in every society and in world society - what is private, what is public,
what is allowed as luxury, what is deemed necessary for survival - and
how decisions like this are made, if they are made - affects the
Literature Industry and every work of writing.  So a poet might choose
to "deny art" - to "not use metaphor" - to do "straight reporting" or
use "transparent, functional language" - "include documentary material" -
etc. not only to "be political", but to change the dynamic of the
literary contract between author and readers.  To try to import an
immediate, didactic element into a poem.  Or a poet might try to
carefully DISTORT "transparent language" in a way that brings out what
such language conceals.  Or a poet might design an allegory or symbol
of a many-sided political situation - this seems like the function
of metaphor on a "macro" level.  Or a poet might "be political" by
NOT being political - by foregrounding emotion, sensibility, aesthetics,
in order to substantiate these evidences of life and humanity outside
of any power situation, or, conversely, to present a reality that
SHOULD exist if there were justice in the world.

All these forms of communication in poetry seem to be happening all the
time in very complex ways. To "not use metaphor" seems sort of
isolated to me as a literary "strategy".  Isolated or abstract or
something.  But these questions of a writer's "contract" or position
or strategy within the larger environment of what a society is doing
- whether or not a particular writer can consciously manipulate these
issues and remain an artist at all - these issues are the pivot around
which the political aspect of someone's work revolve.
- Henry Gould

*** 'Wag the Dog' tickles Albanian prime minister

Albania's prime minister hasn't seen the film "Wag the Dog" yet, but
he says he isn't afraid of life imitating art. In the movie, a U.S.
president enlists the help of a filmmaker and spin doctor to stage a
make-believe military assault on Albania to distract public attention
from a presidential sex scandal. Prime Minister Fatos Nano, on a
three-day visit to Israel, said he wasn't offended by the movie's
choice of Albania as an obscure target for a fake U.S. attack. See

*** Portugal to break record on Europe's longest bridge

Portugal plans to cook its way into the Guinness Book of records by
seating 15,000 people at the longest dinner table ever laid, to
celebrate the opening of Europe's longest bridge. The table will
stretch 3 miles along Lisbon's Vasco da Gama suspension bridge, which
is due to open officially at the end of the month, and beat the
previous world record by half a mile, organizers said Wednesday.
Cooks are already at work preparing the 6,750 tons of "feijoada," a
heavy southern Portuguese stew of beans, onions and assorted meat
that will be served at the massive eat-in on March 22. The 11-mile
bridge across the River Tagus opens two months before the launch of
Expo'98, the Lisbon world fair which marks the 500th anniversary of
navigator Vasco da Gama's discovery of the sea route to India.

CNN factoid last night - which before this whimsical thread I would have
ignored - who is the all-time leading left-handed scorer in the NBA?
Answer: Artis Gilmore - over 24,000 points.

Just curious though - wouldn't the root meaning of ambidextrous imply
having two right hands rather than a parity between the left and the
right? Also, what's the Pound reference in _Cantos_ to "O Sinistro"
which comes flooding back now unbidden?

Being the dense sort, when they put a pen or pencil or crayon into my
right
hand, I used it there. It wasn't until around age seven, when (in the
days
before mini-T-ball leagues) playing baseball with my dad's right-handed
glove I simply couldn't throw, so got into the habit of taking the glove
off
first and then throwing (a la Jim Abbott, the one-handed pitcher) until
I
could convince my folks to invest in a left-handed glove. When I tried
batting left-handed, suddenly I could hit, and in fact I now do all
sports
as a leftie (even kick with my left foot). But I still write
right-handed
and my pen-person-ship demonstrates for all to see that this is not a
"natural" mode.

One twin (Colin) is a lefty with a pen, tho a switch hitter. Jesse is
strictly a righty. I've been told that such a division is almost
standard
with twins.

Count Erica Hunt among the lefties.

who is the all-time leader in wins for a left-hander, most home runs
by a left-handed pitcher?

Spahn returns to haunt the list once more.

ok:  my mother was right-handed, my father was left-handed... but my father
was forced to write (he printed, all uppercase) right-handed by, as he
called them, the nuns...

me, i'm right-handed (as a writer too), with the exception that i shovel,
sweep, etc. left-handed... which is to say, heavy work of that sort i do
left-handed, and a few minor tasks as well (from what i've been able to
determine)...

i figure it musta been my father's doing, unwittingly...

best,

When I was little I wrote with both hands--

When I came to the midpoint of a page, I would switch--

The thing is, though, that I had some sort of brain dysfunction--my two
hemispheres were, apparently, not connected properly (the connection,
which I believe takes the form of a kind of tendon-like rope of brain
matter, was not fully devloped or something)--

Thus, I would not only switch hands, but I would write backwards with the
right hand--producing a mirror-like effect--

This problem went away on its own--but I too was sometimes forced to erase
my homework and re-do it with my right hand--

This was part of some sort of experiment on the parts of some curious
school administrators--not part of any study or anything--it was
just terrible--

These so-called "viruses" do not exist.  All three of the below-listed
"viruses" are listed as hoaxes on the McAfee virus hoax web page
[http://www.nai.com/services/support/hoax/hoax.asp] .

FYI: Viruses CANNOT be contained in an email message, only in an attachment
which is opened through an application.  These messages just take up
bandwidth (unfortunately, so do corrective messages such as this one).

        Those outside the status quo use poetry to gain acceptance . . .
or some such problematic and seemingly facile assesment?!  Could you
provide an example or some sort of situation for this statement?

On another topic altogether, I was wondering whether others share my
particular form of insanity:  A couple of years ago I started to memorize
poetry almost obsessively.  I had done this fairly casually throughout the
years but soon I started to memorize as much as possible; I am obliged to
drive across the state of Missouri every week and I use the five hours to
rehearse as many poems as I can, though after about 35 or 40 I get
mentally fatigued.  I noticed that I began to pay much more attention to
the distinctive intonational patterns of different poets and texts.

Apologies for long turgid double post on this.  I was out at the Century
Lounge until way late last night, playing harp & drinking Old Grandad.
My excuse for the semi-pseudo-rationalism.

I was referring to the general phenomenon of "co-optation".  Knowledge and
literacy are power.  The institutions of knowledge are the cream of the
established order.  I'm not judging that order as good or bad;
just remarking on a system in which voices of alienation, protest,
satire, subversion, condemnation - voices formalized in art - are rewarded
with honorary degrees, faculty positions, grants, attention, and all
the perquisites of membership in that establishment.  - Henry Gould

I harbor no resentment, hold no one in contempt, wish for the overthrow of
no status quo, believe you get what you deserve, like what I like, and
that does not include stale granola.

I can't tell if you are advocating tendentious poetry here, but this
might be because of my reading or misreading here.  It does seem to
me that "conscious manipulation"'s tendency toward adherence to
predetermined form leaves little space for 'slack' (play) in the
material's potential influence on the writer.

I for one still find the metaphor-metonymy distinction useful in terms of=
 its=0Aapplication to how the mind works, in terms of poetic processes, a=

a key role in my=0Aarticle, "Althusser Metonymy China Wall," which Barry =
Watten and Lyn Hejinian=0Aare reprinting in the next Poetics Journal. My =
use of these terms, however, is=0Aitself metaphorical in the common sense=
 (terms from one realm operating within=0Aanother).

Before printing the appropriate passages from that article, however, I wa=

Two passages from the above-mentioned article:

1.
But I first want to pose a strategic distinction between metaphor and=0Am=
etonymy. Metaphor might be seen as a transcendental movement; through=0Am=
etaphor we translate the terms from one field into the terms of another, =
the=0Arelationship or positioning between these terms seen as vertical, a=
=0Asubstitution from above to below, inside to outside. Metaphor assumes =
a=0Acertain equivalence, a reduction of differences, between the two term=
s in=0Aorder for this substitution to be possible. Metonymy, on the other=
 hand, works=0Alaterally, establishing relationships of contiguity throug=
h pairings and=0Adisplacements. This shift from metaphor to metonymy move=
s us from=0Atranscendence to immanence. As both Althusser and Kafka will =
suggest, metaphor=0Ais inherently theological in its structuring of media=
tion itself as a=0Arelationship to something outside or above the structu=
re or terrain, and by=0Aits positioning of the mediator as one who inhabi=

2.
The building of the wall presents an enigma: why would the high command, =
if=0Atheir intention is to safeguard us from the fierce nomads of the Nor=
th, plan=0Athis piecemeal method of construction which leaves gapse in th=

e-effects of the wall-=0Abuilding process=97the sense of purpose, the uni=
ty, the cooperation, the=0Awillful, even enthusiastic, submission to the =
dictates of the high=0Acommand=97rather than the wall itself. Or, as the =
scholar in the story explains,=0Athey really wanted to build a foundation=
 for a tower that would complete the=0Aabandoned project of the Tower of =
Babel. But how can a quarter-circle=0Astructure with extensive gaps provi=
de such a base? Hence the conclusion that=0Athe tower must be meant spiri=
tually, metaphorically. Which raises the next=0Aquestion, Why then build =
the wall itself if the tower is only a metaphor? The=0Anarrator's answer,=
 which comes later in the tale and with no explicit=0Aconnection, is that=
 the tower is a metaphor for the "superficial culture=0Amounting sky-high=
 around a few precepts that have been drilled into people's=0Aminds for c=
enturies, precepts which, though they have lost nothing of their=0Aeterna=
l truth, remain entirely invisible in this fog of confusion." The=0Abuild=
ing of the wall, the enclosure of a political and ideological space,=0Aso=
mehow provides a base for the installations of the high command itself in=
=0Athe tower, elevating them above the people like the mysterious and abs=
ent gods=0Athey appear to be to the common people. The building of the wa=

or, a little closer to home, "So much depends . . ." or any number of
wcw poems where the gesture is "look" and not "compare" or "look at
me looking at that!" (which perhaps next natural gesture is to
compare "you look at that different than i look at that )(granted

"see me looking").  But there's a way in which metaphor
doesn't just let things be in the world and be seen there in whatever
"chance" association.  metaphor forces association (which forces
universality -- this poem is so you see like me)

Interesting point.  If I understand you right, you are saying
metaphor is more directive and "guides" the auditor in a
particular direction.  This is true of metaphor in therapy and
hypnosis, but I hadn't made the same connection for literature.

Every piece of writing is marked by a worldview and motivated to "get
across" something.  The decision to "let the poem take me where it
leads or write itself" is no less motivated than any other.  In my own
experience the desire to "make a picture" in poetry involves welding
together more than I expected or knew about when I began - this is the
poem's own momentum.  But the direction of the momentum is determined
beforehand as clearly as possible.  This welding process is a kind of
play - but there are only 22 players in a soccer game. And there's a
field they're playing on.

On another note: I regret the paranoia implicit in previous post today
about "co-optation".  I think that was basically wrong-headed.  One
would hope that society is not some determining Leviathan providing
niches for the opposition.  And the struggle to achieve a place to
stand and criticize the problems facing the world does not equal
being "co-opted".  I will say though that it's important to look
a gift horse in the mouth, if it comes from the Greeks. - Henry Gould

    I've never "bought" the anti-metaphor line, at least in any
    rigid sense (to say there are limits to metaphor or to any
    linguistic tool is one thing, but to say "metaphor forces
    association" and doesn't just let the world BE is quite another...
    for to condemn metaphor (or symbols, etc.) on the grounds of
    the latter, wouldn't one have to condemn POETRY on the grounds
    of the latter more generally? I mean, poetry, if it is referential
    (as the simple readings of WCW go), itself doesn't let the world
    BE, nor do I think it is necessary that we claim it should.
    By the way, I think that KARSTEN HARRIES essay in the SHeldon
    Stacks book ON METAPHOR (which touches on WCW and others), though
    I do not always agree with it, is very useful in addressing how
    WCW does NOT avoid metaphor, but rather employs it precisely to
     show its own (and the poem's) insufficiency....and THEN, only
     after engaging in what Stevens might call the act of the mind
     defending us from itself (in this Stevens and WCW are actually
     aligned--despite the well-publicized divisions between them),
     may be let the world BE (in a way perhaps we couldn't beforehand
     and is maybe why we 'turn to poetry'). Anyway, that's a simplisitc
     reading of Harries, but it at least points towards a view that
     allows for metaphor in 20th century poetry---
     though I like the Neruda line too. Chris

This is very interesting. I think I see what you mean now. That is a good
and desirable thing: to see a red wheelbarrow as what it is, instead of
comparing it to something else.

But I'm not so sure that we can ever see things as they really are. Ever. I
think that's, like, god's territory [as Yeats or that Spandrift rogue has
already said somewhere, somewhat more lyrically]. And besides, who's god?
Not me.

Does that make me a popomo? or just another pomo? or just a mo?

On the other hand, if one wanted to dismantle the concept of theology or
transcendence, one could use metonymy rather than metaphor as the wall-
breaker in just as strategic a fashion.  As follows:  "Metonymy might be
seen as a transcendental movement: the Play of Dionysus moving with
exquisite Randomness through the materiality of Smoke, Cigarette, Barstool,
Dead Detective, Mirror, creating a Noir Cosmos out of Contiguity.
Metaphor, on the other hand, by implying a pedestrian, rationalistic
Likeness between disparate things, will never transcend the humdrum
humanist willfulness of associations inherent in the earthbound gluing
together (by means slime from the Babel Tower) of "similar" things."

Furthermore, when EP says "make it new", what does he mean? Does he mean
"take a good long look and don't compare -- just put it there next to the
wheelbarrow"?

I don't think so. I think he's talking about metaphor. Make it new. See it
new, Metaphor.

No?

She is a great poet. Her _Naked Poems_ of three decades ago is the best
short long poem I know of. She had a long correspondence with Robert
Duncan, to give her a USAmerican context. But she doesnt need one.

Ron's baseball story is interesting. My left-handed kid brother learned his
baseball from me, a rightie, so he throws and bats right handed. But
writes, etc lefthanded. He plays gold every day now, and hits right handed.
One summer day 3 years ago I set up a golf game between him and my
Australian writer buddy Brian Edwards. Brian is a righthander who plays

I'm not sure what I hoped to find on the poetics list but I'm sure that I
haven't found it.
What I have encountered is a professorial smugness (people who can't or won't
distinguish between living and dead poets; people who scoff at the political
efficacy of writing) propped up by extraordinary silences (most of the list is
voiceless most of the time).
There's way too much concern with position--with laurels, with "winning", with
self-congratulation and self-promotion.  The sound of one hand (who gives a
damn if it is left or right) clapping one's self on the back.
You folks have a powerful tool at your disposal.  One can only hope that you
figure out how to make better use of it.

Signing off.

Hello Colleagues:

We are writing because we have just learned that the TIAA-CREF Committee on
Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility will be meeting this coming
Tuesday (3/17), and are asking you to EMAIL CEO JOHN BIGGS BEFORE TUESDAY in
support of the campaign. This is the group that has considered our proposal
before. Coincidentally, we have telephoned a number of the people on the
committee recently and found at least some support from some of them--or at
least an openness to explore the situation further. Besides going over our
basic arguments, we are urging them to at least bring in someone who has
specific knowledge on positive investing to present that position.

We thank those of you who responded to our recent postal mailing and sent an
email to TIAA-CREF and sent a copy to us. It would help enormously if those
who have not yet written could send a brief email message to John Biggs, with
copies to Albert Wilson and Martin Leibowitz, at feedback@tiaa-cref.org: ask
them to do positive investing for the Social Choice Account, or at least
allow someone knowledgable in that specific area to be involved the
discussions. Ask that the message be forwarded to Biggs BEFORE TUESDAY. Send
copies to us at aaf@manchester.edu or njw@manchester.edu.

There are over a hundred people around the country who have expressed
interest in the campaign, and if all could write now, it might really be
productive. Thanks much,

                                                Neil and Abby

p.s. If at any time you wish to be taken off our mailing list, please let us
know

Subject:      "metaphor" on a bus: deconstructing
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I remember Geoffrey Hartmann and/or Paul deMan drawing a picture of a bus
on a blackboard at Yale in 1978.  It was a bus he had seen in Greece, and
on the side it said "metaphor" in Greek letters.  Apparently that was a
standard word on Athens busses; the busses "carried things over" or
something. He (whichever man it was) thought that was marvellous, and he
drew an adorable bus.  It was one of the rare times in the course that I
saw him evince joy at something.  The bus was so REAL, I now realize. I
think it somehow let him (DeMan, I think it was, actually) off the hook.

That minute was the first time that I heard the word trope.  Tropes were
absolutely the cat's pajamas (now that's a good metonym-metaphor
combination) then.  We read a Nietzsche essay that used how metaphors work
to show that nothing meant anything, and my friends and I had our minds
duly blown, blown down to the bottom. And, moreover, we felt terror at
having our minds blown, as we were supposed to.

I can't help wondering if the 80's turn away from metaphor was a backlash
reaction to such overmystification of metaphor.  SO much (or the lack of so
much) depended on metaphor.   Metaphor, not metonymy, was the hardcore
trope of choice in that particular "Lit X" classroom.


Obviously, this has nothing to do with Linda's original query (I think not,
anyway.  On the other hand, such machinations with metaphor obviously
didn't help the perception that metaphor would be helpful for poems that
wanted to engage with the world politically).
Annie

        Tom,
        If your still with us, I'd suggest that you take advantage of the
list to make an intervention, to assert, question, and reconfigure your
stance(s) and do the daring, as does Keston Sutherland by actually posting
poems, by speaking with instead of speaking against.  Silence, for myself
at least, probably has more to do with folks just being too busy . . . but
those same busy-bodies return to the list as a resource when they need it.
You'll find these self-congradulatory cryptics wherever you go.

tom, Im saddened that youve left the list, have felt similarly to you,
that there is amazing potential on lists such as this one (&
wri-eye-tings) bandwidth that is largely unexplored, & tho no medium is
perfect, actions such as networking & extending one's own works into a
public medium, & even learning, are goals that are quite reachable
here.  I wonder (if you are still here) if you would speak more to the
failed hopes that you had, & wonder if there is any sense of an
emotional overwhelmance, (which more than anything else with list
participation, I become discouraged by, & usually a few days of space
makes be hungry again for jumping back into the muck}

Id like to make it clear, that you were shaking the tree & fruit was

Judy is right, of course. I almost pointed out the same thing, until I
realized that, just because WSB said it FIRST, doesn't mean that Laurie
Anderson didn't SAY IT herself. And if Carolyn wants to quote Laurie
Anderson's version, what the hell (esp. Since LA is still alive and can
actually say the words) (and since so far as I know she (anderson) never
appeared in a Nike commercial).

Charles Simic has this to say about the ignoble spoon,


Spoon


An old spoon,
Chewed,
Licked clean,

Polished back
To its evil-eyed
Glow,

Eying you now
>From the table,
Ready to scratch

Today's date
And your name
On the bare wall.

-Charles Simic
-------------------------------

Fork


This strange thing must have crept
Right out of hell
It resembles a birds foot
Worn around the cannibal's neck

As you hold it in your hand,
As you stab with it into a piece of meat,
It is possible to imagine the rest of the bird:
Its head which like your fist
Is large, bald, beakless, and blind.

Tom,

I've a good guess re why so little responsiveness to postings to the list
lately: it's spring break at many US universities these days.  Purdue's in
the middle of its, Cornell's starts next week, some were last week.  I
just got back in town myself.

But there's also this: Professorial smugness is really half the fun of
being in the academy. It's one of the perqs (sp?), the plusses, the
bonuses (boni?).  But really in my experience smugness is much more a
phenomenon associated with the literati, not necessarily the academy. Even
if this list were composed of mostly non-academics (which I think is _not_
the case), you'd have that smug silence, self-congratulation and
condescension -- common symptoms of writers and a certain kind of habitual
reader.

Vitriol, egotism, and ostracism are the three pillars of the canon.

Furthermore, a listerv is like an open sore for those sorts of bacteria:
it's more difficult to make a good joke or make a good gesture via email
than it is to make a wise-crack or a witty riposte that might be a bit
off-base and a bit off-topic and a bit hardy-harrh-har. The simple fact
that we are writing to a vast and potentially immediately responsive group
of strangers is a bit hard to ignore -- whihc makes the silence that
follows a posting even harder to ignore. Consider a political podium, say
at a televised national convention: you never find much chit-chat, much of
anything of importance discussed, much of anything but backscratching and
hand-clasping: podiums nad rostrums just aren't the place for a good
raging discussion: that takes intimacy.

There is a tendency, that is to say, to mistake, I think, ecommunication
as something that can be or become private or intimate.  It can't.  You
say it's a potentially important tool: maybe so.  But it's a privatizing
tool: that's what it's REALLY good at.  It's not a public tool, not a
public-making or community-making tool.  It's more on the order of a
hacksaw than a screwdriver: it cuts us apart rather than squishing us
together.

With all that said, I have to sayt hat I DO find a great deal of worth on
this here listserv: much humor, great jokes, really brilliant exchanges,
high wit, shocking insights (yours included), and, yes, raunchy and
rancorous and petty invective.

But hey: like any good anthology, you gotta pick and choose. You chose to
close the book. That's okey dokey. Just know, footnote to headline: you
were a good read.

gabriel, i don't follow you at all:  email *can't* be intimate?... what do
you mean?---do you mean that if i establish what i think is an intimate
relationship with someone online, intimate in the sense of a mutual
plumbing of emotions and convictions---i'm self-deceived?...

i've seen that word "intimacy" used to describe sexual relationships
between strangers...

again, i can't understand how any medium excludes the possibilities of
intimacy---assuming intimacy is itself mediated... at the same time, there
is something about *this* medium---as a public medium---that can be used to
promote one-on-one intimacies... if i backchannel you, and we get to
talking, you may very well feel inclined to reveal more of yourself than
you might f2f... it's happened to me and to many i know... on the other
hand, you might not feel this way---up to you... i suspect though that the
nature of this medium has something to do with being able to spatialize
thought, and figure thinking, with some care---not quite the same as the
telephone... not quite the same as a hard-copy letter, either... but
reaching across distances faster, across different walks of life faster, in
a more synchronous setting... public, and not so...

does this mean that we needn't meet f2f?... no---having just met keith tuma
after knowing him online for a few years, i feel our f2f connection helped
to solidify our friendship... i could say the same for many other folks,
who themselves might say the same... and i've met folks f2f, whom i've
grown closer to after having met them again online...

again, depends on how you come to this medium, any medium... i wouldn't
come here expecting a utopia, i might come here trying to push or pull
toward something better... i've always found, when it comes to social
organizations, that the whole is less than the sum of the individual
beings, even if its greater than any one individual... so i always see
something to shoot for...

too bad tom left...

best,

joe

Yah, Joe, that's basically what I'm saying.

I think it's a rather _convivial_ medium.  But it's not intimate.  There's
nothing very intimate about the movies or about television: broadcasting
isn't intimate.  Reading broadcasts isn't intimate.  600 people read this
stuff, and most, I imagine, give the material here well-deserved
distinterest. And though you're right to say that one-to-one letters
(backchanneling, I see it's called)  can serve an intimacy: but it can't
_create_ one. Not a genuine one, anyway. You must be able to see, smell,
touch, at times taste, embrace, have coffee with -- and yada yada yada
with -- anybody with whom you are to become intimate.

 >
> i've seen that word "intimacy" used to describe sexual relationships
> between strangers...

I'm not sure, but I think that's, like, Irony.  If not, I'd have to say
that whoever uttered those words was either purposefully or ignorantly
embracing an idea that can only be characterized as an abomination.

> again, i can't understand how any medium excludes the possibilities of
> intimacy---assuming intimacy is itself mediated...

That's my point: intimacy is not mediated.  I know that as an educated
person I'm expected to believe, as they cliche goes, that Everything's
mediated.  But that's frankly a load of codswallop.

>if i backchannel you, and we get to
> talking, you may very well feel inclined to reveal more of yourself than
> you might f2f... it's happened to me and to many i know...

"getting to talking" and talking itself does not an intimacy make.  Look,
I'm not saying anything new or profound here: the origin and basis of
intimacy, of friendship, as ol Cicero said (and about which he was
probably right) is love and goodwill. I, yes, _do_ happen to avow the old
medieval idea of the Word -- both verbum and verbum dei.  Where love and
goodwill are present, there is intimacy; I certainly don't believe that
epistolary relationships preclude intimacy, insofar as they don't preclude
love and goodwill: but letters (epistles, not the alphabetical dingies)
aren't great packhorses: they can't bear, often, very much love and
goodwill -- and this is simply because the principle way a human being
lies is through the word: we _see_ the truth about someone, or _know_ the
truth about someone, or _recognize_ it, but we rarely _read_ it, and if we
do read it, we certainly aren't very inclined to trust it.  Though the
National Inquirer is one of my favorite newspapers.

Anyway, I'm belaboring, like, the obvious, I think.

Look, reading this stuff, these posts from the former Tom and from you and
from others -- the great Silliman et alii -- I learn a great deal about
myself and about the play of ideas, but I frankly learn nothing about the
people who type this stuff into the 600 various computers linked by this
listserv.  I learn about what they think nad sometimes about what they
feel, but nothing about who they are.

I would say that your intimacy or friendship did not begin until you
actually shook tuma's hand, right?  I'd frankly go so far as to say
that prior to that handshake each of you was, in a sense, talking only to
himself: that each of you facilitated a rather common kind of self-inquiry
for the other.

Anyway, all best, Joe.


At ten eastern tonight
I'll put my two lips
on the upper right hand of my screen:
I'd like to believe
you'll be doing the same.

Gabriel, smiling.

Dear List:

Do any of you know of a poet named Semenovich.  Either Joe Semenovich or
Joel Semenovich?  He has apparently died.  He lived in Brooklyn.  He died
sometime after october of 1997.

He sent three brilliant and, like, very weird poems to the Sycamore and I
sat on them for four months hemming and hawing: they were about how
jealous he was of Sharon Olds and how good she looks in her photographs
and how he'd like to, like, get really intimate with her (f-word).  I
wrote him last month apologizing for the delay and explaining why we
weren't going to run his poems, which were about not ever getting
published and how sick he was of never getting published and about how
jealous he was of successful poets and about how he was getting older and
obsessed with his total failure to be recogized and read.  They were great
poems, but there was an aesthetic donnybrook in the offices about running
them (people insisting I had lost my taste etc) -- it got complicated.
Anyway, the letter I wrote came by return to sender and the big black word
DECEASED scrawled across Semenovich's address.

My question is: did anybody know him?  If so, could you backchannel me and
tell me briefly about him, who he was, if in fact he is dead or if this
was, like, a joke, or if this guy really wasn't known at all?

I'd appreciate it.  It's sort of eating me.

gabriel, part of my deepest (as 'twere), most essential nature (as 'twere)
is right here, in these words... the ones you're reading on your screen and
the ones i'm reading on mine...

no shit, really...

i don't say the world is mediated b/c it's fashionable to say so... i say
it's mediated b/c this is how i've found it out... the actual, physical
touch of a human being is mediated by our *own* flesh---which has all to do
with how we come to it... i mean, the understanding or lack thereof we
bring to it ('learn how to listen to your body')... else my own flesh &
blood, say, would be the same as any other's, no?... my father's
touch---not different, but different again, not simply b/c he was
different, but b/c of how i imagine or feel his being, as my father... a
matter of distance---physical distance, that marks two separate entities,
and a matter of resolving such distance, or trying to... like death
perhaps... and again, since i bring such meaning to *this* stuff, i say
things become intimate... quickly in fact, in fact sometimes too quickly...
which is why the intimacy my wife and i had developed over 3-4 months
online had, for a future, to become a matter of flesh in order to become
lasting... i mean, as husband and wife---and perhaps it needn't be this way
either... both of us understood how this medium, like all media, can make a
fool of you... but we had become intimate prior to meeting in the flesh...
you may rather say that we laid the groundwork for intimacy---but from
where i sit, this groundwork was part & parcel of our intimacy...

like you say, words (can) lie... so do bodies, how we come to understand
them... i just don't see anyway around this... but again, words (can) speak
truth... again, like the body... i never mistake words for bodies, or
bodies for words... i would of course "trash" the words sooner than "trash"
the bodies... but assigning such priority to bodies is not to assign bodily
interactions the sole site of intimacy... b/c such interaction of necessity
includes communication of some sort... and you can take the latter with
you, as 'twere... isn't this what makes us social creatures?...
occasionally i've found bodily presence to exceed or supplant words in my
relations with others---often this has created real problems for me in
establishing intimacy... words can do this too, i.e., create problems...

i would say that for intimacy you really need it all, gabriel---words and
bodies, some sort of communicative understanding... so for me this stuff is
part of that intimacy, just as words of yore (so to speak)... but they work
differently around t/here, and in this era... in any case, words,
significant words, are vital to my sense of what intimacy is, can be...

all best,

Maria,  well, the poems _should_ be in a pile in my office and I pray
they're still there.  But I have to say that I'd feel a little freaky
about doing that just now: I don't even know if the guy's actually Dead,
you know?  It sort of at this point feels like rifling a dead guy's
wallet or taking a dead guy's boots or something.  Can anybody verify if
this guy has passed on?

For now, I'd just like to learn about him: can anybody help me out here?
He lived on Glenwood Rd in Brooklyn.  I don't have a clue about Brooklyn.
Anybody know this guy?

Thanks to those who posted re: paratactic.  Does seem to be an analogue
to psychological meaning although not exact: prelogical (not in a pejorative
way), implicit (not conscious) actions, in particular actions toward someone
in an intimate (attachment) relationship.

metaphor/metonym discussion suggests that metonym may be similiar move
back away from logical discourse but the question then is whether there
is another direction that can be taken besides a return to metaphor.

?related to 'revival of formalism'?

The emotional appeal of parataxis like that of drumming is surely pre
logical (and I think some in the Eshleman wing of deep subject poetics
have used pre-conscious in order to describe this effect ...

If I remember Jakobsen drew hos thoughts on metonomy from work with
aphasics--which could be defined as a contiguity disorder ????

On the other hand--to invoke something in common to holographic,
fractal, and maybe genetic models --each slice of the string seems to
have metaphoric potentials of expansion ...

if you drop a stone in a pool and watch the rings spread on the
surface--it is because of replicant seriality expanding that one notices
the rose pattern ...

metaphor + insight

and it is surely not as logical as analogy
and in a digital world, there is a poetic place for the analog ...

Mime-Version: 1.0

For the (burgeoning) record I'm a lefty too, but I hit right-handed and
dribble right-handed, prefer to drive the basket from the right side, but
have a left-handed jumpshot, yet throw a football right-handed. Make what
you will of all that (hint: I've *never* had a guaranteed contract).

I type with both hands.

The following is for those who would actually like to understand metaphor
and metonymy.

I have no idea why, but one of the received ideas of our poetic time, has
someone else mentioned this? intanced this?, is that metaphor is bad
metonymy good. Comparing one thing to another, tsk tsk. How could you?
Don't you see the uniqueness the singularity of all? The general
singularity I mean. This highly-reduced sauce is too thick to pour on
anything anyone really cooks up, alas, and metaphor (see the previous one)
is cool! (a metaphor) For example *all* theory is metaphor -- see
Riemannian geometry, relativity, gravity as "bent" space (metaphor), string
theory, you get the idea (how could you from this fragmentary address?)
(<-- metaphor), or did you think the Krebs Cycle was a real geometric form?

Has someone mentioned the extraordinary work of George Lakoff on metaphor?

I liked someone suggesting that fork might be a good metonymy for knife --
actually, the peas are a better metonymy for the knife, tho it is the
spoonness of a knife to which the peas attach. Note that knife, fork, and
spoon began life as "stick." Metaphor moved them on (look at your hand).

A serious section:  favored though was the citation from (suggestion by?)
someone (G. Hartley?) that metaphor is inherently transcendental---no need
to open the bus door at that stop---and metonymy imminent---because it is
busy "establishing relationships of contiguity." I hope it is obvious that
this cart won't pull a horse.

Metonymy *relies on,* it doesn't establish, relationships of contiguity (or
other existing connection---flag for country, boat, patriotism, etc.).
That's why a spoon is *not* a metonymy for a knife, run away though they
did together. Your uncle may be your lover, your uncle may even be a
metaphor for your lover, but your uncle will *never* be a metonymy for your
lover, not even if they're roommates.

Metaphor *establishes* relationships---including those of
contiguity---between things which are different. Providing Kafka, btw, as
evidence that metaphor means transcendence imposes a particular
interpretation on his work; indicating that reading "Kafka will suggest
(that) metaphor is inherently theological in its structuring of mediation
itself as a relationship to something outside or above the structure or
terrain, and by its positioning of the mediator as one who inhabits a space
or opening between us and some external power" is not more than 180 degrees
off, since the play of metaphor in Kafka balances on the non-realizability,
non-translatability of all that metaphor makes available as its intention.
The trial is precisely not a trial, the castle not a place of high degree.
I.e. these are precisely *not* theological and non-transcendant. They are
what you are flattened against in the most imminent fashion, and the
metaphor stands in for an inability to conceptualize your life. Gregor
Samsa as beetle, no mediator available.

For Hartley (or whoever I'm standing him in for metaphorically, some poor
straw man) to suggest that "Metaphor assumes a certain equivalence, a
reduction of differences, between the two terms in order for this
substitution to be possible" indicates a pretty deep misunderstanding of
what goes on in this area of language. Metaphor precisely extends our
understanding of X *out* of its meaning space by framing it against another
meaning space. It is metonymy that reduces difference. "Red sails in the
sunset" -- the sail is being substituted metonymically for the ship. There
is *intentionally* no semantic difference between them. When bigmouth
talks, we are identifying the fellow (me in this instance it seems)
metonymically. On the other hand, "rosy-fingered dawn" does not "assume a
certain equivalence" between dawn and fingers, it extends the semantics of
"dawn."

That metonymy might get us out of transcendeance and theology is
particularly amusing in the light, for example, of Xtianity's *utterly*
metonymic structure: worship cross, god is actually son of god, etc. etc.
or as the Rabbis used to say "do you believe these people? One end of the
stick they burn for heat, the other end they carve and they bow down before
it?" (that's in Absence Sensorium somewhere I think btw)

Oh well, just more left-handed arrogance from one of the cognoscenti.... I
suppose. Perhaps on the other hand, there's someone to agree with me that
like poets critics ought to know something about language? More likely, my
friends on this list are now grinning as they see me try to pick a fight
for the umpteenth time and those who don't know me either are stunned at my
brilliance or think this post was actually written by Dale Smith. Oh well,
divide and conquer I always say -- to the peas under the mattress of my
knife's pod, that is).

Mandel's really poppin with his left (metaphymitly speaking).  Exactly
right on about the tropes.  Didn't Kenneth Burke say metonymy is a kind
of metaphor?  Applying value judgements to rhetorical tropes
is like Ted Hughes eating crow while forking Sylvia and calling it spooning -
lookout, raven mavens!  You call this pottery?  It bites!

I like Ike and synecdoche too and Tyler too-too Tippecanoe.

Gosh, those rabbis sure knew how to get a laugh out of a crucifixion.
A real knee-slapper toe-nailer, Tom!  An image is an image and a god is a god
and shucks maybe the Muslims are right.  It was all a horsefeedback loopy
sorta hat trick.  Hardehar at yourdeyour and mightymine EXPENSE - seemingly
forever!  Aren't tropes fun??  (Especially on Desolation Row.)

dreaming of white gauze again, lips tied into place,
severed from the body, appearing to emerge, there's always
the first word, slight tumescence of the cloth,
a definition of smothered language, body arched upwards,
hollow beneath the back (where the back would be),
it's an outline of white gauze, it's always damp, as if
excretions were somehow caught up in all of this,
head bending backwards speaking upside-down, all sounds
are coming-out sounds
sdnuos tuo-gnimoc era
i will be a dash caught in a mesh, i will be a period
coming to an end

I knew Joe Semanovich.  He was a real maverick.  Over ten years ago I was
attending then eventually running a poetry group/workshop which met at
the CUNY Grad Center.  One night Joe read a poem that I liked very much
but I think he took offense that I said of the experience that it was
like Gregory Corso reading "The Raven."  As things went on Joe would arrive
at meetings half-tanked and would take swigs off a bottle here and there
over the span of a meeting.  One night he dramatically walked out in a huff
after starting a shouting match with someone who was a featured reader.
I later ran into him at the Hunter College library where he worked. We
were cordial and I don't think he was still mad at me (though his poems
were surely wonderfully mad).  I don't think in our po-world today there
is enough room for people like Joe who was too beset by grievances
among other things to play the game properly. RIP.

Dear Burt, Dear Fallen Angels,

Ok. So that's depressing.  Joe Semenovich, jealous poet and unknown, has,
like, died.

I hope his poems are still in my office.

I guess, though, it's not decided yet that he's actually dead, since it
certainly does seem as if a guy, as described below, would be just as
capable (right word?) of a good practical joke (writing DECEASED on an
overdue envelope) as he would be of dying a relatively boozy death.

I'll call Hunter College.  Thanks for the information.

Joe Semenovich: R, like, In Peace.  Though I frankly am totally chagrined
to think that this actually happened, that htis guy sent Syc Rev his last
or next to last poems, all of which had to do with age, unpublished-dom,
jealousy, and anger, and then, like, goes and Dies. So if this is a joke,
I spose R could be Roar.  Roar (w/ laughter), or Rest, in Peace, J
Semenovich.

Thanks'gain, Burt Kimmelman.  Gabe gudding

I'm really sorry to see Tom Beckett signing off but am sure glad he signed
on. If only because I now have a at least two issues of The Difficulties as
well as one of his own small books. Moreover, his own contributions in even
this short time have been interesting & of use.

But maybe this is a chatroom as much as anything, & that's not even
necessarily a bad thing. Is it?

I didn't go to the trouble Carolyn Guertin did, to actually type in a Webb
poem, but certainly agree that Phyllis Webb is, for many of us, one of the
finest poets around. And _Naked Poems_ is a key text is the growth of
postmodern poetry in Canada, as well as one of the most beautiful desiring
erotic poems since Sappho. It's too bad that all her books have been
published by small Canadian presses & so she is not well known outside the
country. When John Kinsella of Australia was here last year, he found a
copy of her Selected Poems in the guestroom; next morning he came storming
out crying, 'How come I've never heard of this Phyllis Webb before, reading
her was one of the great experiences of my life!' Have to say I liked
that...

Subject:      Re: sininster metaphors vs. dextrous metonymies
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII

Since this topic is still alive and kicking, I'll post an epigram/epitaph
by Donne, which I like because it collapses the metaphor/metonym distinction
that at times is too rigidly upheld:

Fall of a Wall

Under an undermined and shot-bruised wall
A too-bold captain perished by the fall,
Whose brave misfortune, happiest men envied,
That had a town for tomb, his bones to hide.

Cannons were developed to overcome walled cities, since by 15th century
everyone knew about the old wooden-horse-stuffed-with-killers trick.

Henri Lefebvre and Michel de Certeau have many interesting things to say
about metaphor, metonymy, and the definition of spaces.  I can't
recapitulate their ideas here, but they both suggest that these linguistic
ways of creating relationships can support the ideological control of the
body's experiential space to social boundaries.  The joke/metaphor that
the happy men share at the expense of the dead captain is enabled by the
quasi-metonymical alliteration (doesn't Freud's analysis of jokes and
condesation rely on the subordination of metonymy as a tool for metaphor,
maybe not, I'm just free associating here) of "town for tomb," though
there is a buried metonymical relationship if we credit the joke with
recalling the ancient, some would say original, relationship of cities to
cemeteries.

Now that I reread the above I see that it's garbled, but I think Donne's
epigram makes more sense in terms of what someone (sorry I can't recall
who) called the "fractional" character of some of these figures than in
terms of George Hartley's distinction.  But however the terms may fall,
Donne seems to be suggesting that they "hide" the bare bones of misfortune.
Or maybe that metonymy allows the comprehension of the remains of the
metaphorical process, for aren't our skeletons when used as evidence that
our bodies served the defense of metaphor, the ultimate metonymy for the
structures through which language comes and goes, for what is left after
violence has moved on?

sorry for the silence, but here goes / metaphor:

yes i thought that was a problem in my statement when i reread my
post -- & yes poetry doesn't let things be -- but aren't there
different sorts of poetry -- them that try to "above" (Romantics) them
that try "be" among (moderns); EP is a good example here b/c
(harking on George T's post) he DID condemn poetry on those grounds,
no? (WW condemned poetry for other reasons & also sought to "make it
new"  in lyrical ballads . . .) making it new to EP meant (also, &c) making
it seeable (letting it be) (& to comment on GT, addressing metaphor was
but one way to address this) instead of forcing it into some construct
(what i meant by _forcing_ associations).  I think there are
different in nuances btw "forcing" "making" "requesting" --
differences in the way different poets treat their materials.
Metaphysicals force, objectivists prod? again, perhaps to simplistic
but a simple way to discern.

Also, i thought you _had to_ condemn poetry to write it.  to want to
make the "new" poetry . . .

btw, george thompson's post:
>Furthermore, when EP says "make it new", what does he mean? Does he
>mean "take a good long look and don't compare -- just put it there
>next to the wheelbarrow"?

>I don't think so. I think he's talking about metaphor. Make it new.
>See it new, Metaphor.

>No?

Beatrice Wood, 105, Potter and 'Mama of Dada'

By ROBERTA SMITH


  Beatrice Wood, a ceramic artist who was known as much for her irreverent
quips, beauty, bohemian lifestyle and famous lovers as for her luminous
luster-glaze chalices, and who inspired at least two movie characters, died on
Thursday at her home in Ojai, Calif. She had celebrated her 105th birthday on
March 3.

  An independent woman inclined to say whatever was on her mind, Ms. Wood
famously attributed her longevity to "chocolate and young men" and just as
memorably titled her 1985 autobiography "I Shock Myself." In fact she was a
lifelong vegetarian who neither smoked nor drank and who remained clear-minded
enough to take up the computer at the age of 90.

  Until two years ago, she worked at the potter's wheel every day, following a
strict daily regimen in a studio that was listed under "Places of Interest" in
Ojai. A member of the Theosophy movement since 1923, she had moved to Ojai in
1948 to be near its leader, the Indian sage Krishnamurti.

  For the last four decades of her life, she dressed exclusively in bright
Indian saris and wore large amounts of silver-and-turquoise jewelry, even when
throwing pots, with her thick, hip-length gray hair twisted into braids or a
bun.

  She was born in San Francisco and reared in New York, and demonstrated an
early affinity for art and nonconformity, much to the dismay of her wealthy
parents. She once said that she was 23 before she got free of her mother and
her lady's maid, but she was allowed to go, chaperoned, to Paris when she was
18, where she studied painting at the Academie Julien and acting at the
Comedie Francaise. Back in New York she fell in with some of the most
adventurous artistic characters in town.

  Her friends included Man Ray, Francis Picabia, Charles Sheeler, Walter and
Louise Arensberg, Edgard Varese and Mina Loy. She was closest to Marcel
Duchamp and his friend the diplomat and writer Henri-Pierre Roche.

  The three founded Blind Man, a magazine that was one of the earliest
manifestations of the dada art movement in New York. (In the second and last
issue, Ms. Wood defended Duchamp's infamous urinal, rejected by the jury of
the 1917 Independents exhibition, with a sentence usually attributed to
Duchamp himself: "The only works of art America has given are her plumbing and
her bridges.")

  Duchamp encouraged her to draw; the results were fey, often autobiographical
caricatures.

  Her life was already the stuff of movies. Roche's novel about a menage a
trois, "Jules et Jim," would inspire Francois Truffaut's 1961 movie of the
same name, with the character played by Jeanne Moreau based in part on Ms.
Wood.

  In 1993, she was the subject of a documentary, "Beatrice Wood, the Mama of
Dada," directed by Diandra Douglas. And more recently, she inspired the
101-year-old character of Rose in the movie "Titanic," directed by James
Cameron, a neighbor in Ojai.

  Ms. Wood liked to say that she had loved seven men she didn't marry and
married two men she didn't love, saying that neither marriage was consummated.

  Her first, in 1919, to a theater manager from Montreal, resulted from family
pressure and soon ended in annulment when it was discovered that the man
already had a wife in Belgium.

  In 1938, while living in Los Angeles, she married Steve Hoag, an engineer,
after a house they owned together in North Hollywood was swept away in a
flood, on the correct theory that married people were likely to get Red Cross
relief more easily. He lived with her until his death in 1960.

  She was a late bloomer as an artist and did not encounter ceramics until the
1930s, when she failed to find a teapot to match some neo-rococo luster-glaze
plates she had bought in Holland.

  She enrolled in a pottery course at Hollywood High School, and began to
research the luster-glaze process in a local library.

  She never made that teapot, but became fascinated with the process. Her
first works -- small glazed figures whose whimsy echoed her drawings -- sold
easily, helping her make it through the Depression. It was not until 1940,
when she studied briefly with the Austrian ceramists Gertrud and Otto Natzler,
that she began to appreciate the beauty and possibilities of ceramics as an
art form.

  After settling in Ojai in 1948, she began to develop her own version of the
unpredictable luster-glaze technique, extending a process that embedded the
metallic iridescence in the glaze itself, rather than painting it on. While
she didn't invent the technique, she did create a unique palette in an
extraordinary range of metallic pinks, golds and greens.

  At first Ms. Wood supported herself by turning out large quantities of
dinner sets, but after the mid 1970s, she was able to concentrate exclusively
on more ambitious decorative vessels: chalices, bowls and vases.

  Her most complex pieces, which had elaborately decorated surfaces, came only
after the mid-1980s, when she was in her 90s. These elaborate, radiant works
dominate her most recent retrospective, held last year at the American Craft
Museum in New York. The show opens in Florida at the Lake Worth Museum of
Contemporary Art on March 27.

  Ms. Wood had her first exhibition in 1949 at America House in New York. Her
museum exhibitions included a retrospective at the Phoenix Art Museum in 1973.
Since 1981, she has had repeated exhibitions at the Garth Clark Gallery, first
in Los Angeles and then in New York, where an exhibition of her work will
close on April 4.

  In 1994, the Smithsonian Institution named Ms. Wood an Esteemed American
Artist and Pete Wilson, governor of California, declared her a "California
Living Treasure."

This is George Hartley (which I keep typing because that doesn't seem to
appear in the message, but I don't know because I only get the digest
version), I'd like to set at least part of the record straight (is that a
metaphor?) for Tom Mandel and Henry Gould:
1. I prefaced my earlier citations with the comment that I'm using the terms
"metaphor" and "metonymy" metaphorically (which should indicate that I have
nothing against metaphor as a linguistic vehicle), meaning further that I'm
not talking about language. When I talk about language, then I'll be happy to
be accused of knowing nothing about it. What I'm talking about is (to use a
metaphor) ideological terrain, a concept I am getting mostly from Althusser
and, after him, Laclau and Mouffe. Now this distinction may in many ways
itself be a tired one, but I found it useful for a particular discussion of
kafka.
2. Having said that, I still can't accept the notion that either metaphor or
metonymy lie there innocently as tools at hand but do (to what degree is the
question) shape our conception of the relationships they establish rather than
simply express (especially if we are borrowing sdomeone else's tropes).
3. That it even occured to the fork and the spoon to run away in the first
place is something that interests me.

George, I confess that I just get confused when I read analytical commentaries
on these tropes.  So I'm not going to say that they can't be understood
ideologically or politically.  But your position here seems to be slyly
self-reflexive.  You say that you're not using the terms to talk about
language per se, but that you're using them metaphorically to talk about
"ideological terrain".  So you're using metaphor just as you describe it
- to set up a hierarchy of values, in which metaphor, on IDEOLOGICAL
TERRAIN, establishes suspicious transcendental-hierarchical relations.
You claim not to be talking about poetry - or "only metaphorically".
But by your own definition, these "metaphors" for metaphor subsume
poetry to the set of your ideological structure of values. I.e.,
materiality and horizontality are "good"; spirituality and verticality
are "bad", or suspicious, or tyrannical, or whatever.

I think the point of Tom's remarks on this, and mine, and several others,
is that this characterization of metaphor-in-action is extremely abstract,
and a lot of evidence has already been brought forward that metaphor
involves materiality and non-hierarchy etc. just as much as metonymy does.
And the point of my remarks here is that you can't get out of your argument
by saying you're only speaking "metaphorically" about language.  Poetry
is the subject and you're applying your theory.  I just think you need
to supply more concrete evidence to win me over, for one.  Trouble is I
gather supplying that evidence was the purpose of all those essays pro-
metonymy of the previous decade, which I'd rather not read anyway...
my ideology gets in the way, like a black hole in a calculator in Calcutta.

seems like Gary's example shows how metaphor & metonymy are interchangeable
depending on the interpreter, to some extent anyway.  I read this little
story as a metaphor for male lust.  The town is a metaphor for tomb - and
the wall is a metonymy for the town & vice-versa - but both tomb and town
are metaphors for the too-bold Captain's objects of desire.  Which means
war and violence in general are also both metaphor-metonymy for same.
Now how does this kind of language use serve ideology?  Well, it's a
kind of rhetoric.  But a poetry of "pure metonymy" - the modernist
"let-be" beauty of rubble, wall, dead Captain, dead detective, smoke -
the aestheticization of all that... can also be read as part of a
"controlling" ideology.  - henry Gould

This quote from Lakoff and Turner:  "More Than Cool Reason: A Field Guide
to Poetic Metaphor" seems quite straightforward:

"--In _metaphor_, there are two conceptual domains, and one is understood
in terms of the other.
In _metaphor_, a whole schematic strcutre (with 2 or more entities) is
mapped onto another whole schematic structure.
In _metaphor_, the logic of the source-domain structure is mapped onto
the logic of the target-domain structure.
None of this is true of metonymy.
_Metonymy_ involves only one conceptual domain.  A metonymic mapping
occurs within a single domain...
_Metonymy is used primarily for reference: via metonymy, one can refer to
one entity in a schema by referring to another entity in the same schema.
In _metonymy_, one entity in a schema is taken as standing for one other
entity in the same schema, or for the schema as a whole.
Metaphor and metonymy do have some things in common.
Both are conceptual in nature.
Both are mappings.
Both can be conventionalized, that is, made part of our everday conceptual
system, and thus used automatically, effortlessly, and without conscious
awareness.
In both, linguistic expressions that name source elements of the mapping
typically also name target elements.  That is, both are means for
extending the linguistic resources of a language."

Got it?

I don't know what the ideological implications of this are... I remember
reading Lakoff on metaphor several years ago and being impressed. (Someone
mentioned George Lakoff in the context of this thread).

Must we allegorize our tropes?

.... but one metonymic mapping, including pockets of metaphor, can be
congruent and overlay another, sometimes matching, sometimes leaving the
ragged edge of difference.

This grammar of metonymic overlays is that of the Canto's I believe
where Pound seeks the forma, the map that articulates the congruence of
the totality of fields.

... to move into pomosexual terrain: Is it not the sliding of such
metonymic fields over one another, creating various conjunctions and
disjunctions,  that Deleuze and Guattari articulate as a Thousand
Plateaus?

Thanks to Jonathan for citing Lakoff and Turner, who say in a whole lot
more words, and with much more insight, what I was trying to say earlier,
more cutely perhaps. As a matter of fact, my own ideas have been influenced
not only by Jakobson but also by Lakoff and a good deal more
linguistic-oriented research on "metaphor analysis" -- in large part
inspired by Lakoff.

The key for me is the notion that metaphor involves mapping between *two*
domains, whereas metonymy confines itself to one domain. Likewise, that
metonymy is an act of reference, whereas metaphor is an act of reflection
[quite literally: two domains and a mirror].

I have to confess that I don't quite understand Don Wellman's post [too
fast for me]. Could you illustrate your comments re "this grammar of
metonymic overlays is that of the Canto's..."

I am a scholar rather than a poet, so you have to go slow for me.

Best wishes,

I feel an impulse to create similes like this one -- an impulse to posit
equivalences just for the power rush of naming (it is because I says it is:
"I procaim all objects equal"), e.g. (but here with a colon instead of a
copula "is" so you can't tell if it's a metaphor or an elaboration)

>voodoo:

equivalences that "pretend illogic" but also assert a jubilant
connectedness of everything ("everything" represented by alogical word
choices, as if those words were congresspeople from disparate districts of
meaning getting together to legislate a poem [now that's a weird
metaphor-who will take it up?]) -- that can be framed as fake formulas

or just try to addle the brain a liddle bit with similes that almost match
up to expectation but slip

>I streched out over you my longest leg
>Like a special hollywood panther dummy

or

>Pursuit of trifles
>carries the days
>outward like spokes
>and at the hub a knot
>like a fingerprint


Does anyone else feel this same compulsion towards fake similes?  As I
write them I'm aware of a perverse flouting of both pomopo convention and
conventional convention and that's part of the pleasure.

A couple of questions about metaphors & analogies:  they are means by which
we understand or conceive of something in terms of something else, right?
(Lakoff said so)  Is there anything we understand in itself and not by any
analogy whatsoever? Would that be *enlightenment*?

balanced with a deployed quota of fakeness, in that goat line, is the fact
of goats' exotic semantic history, much of it biblical but
cropping up variously through philosophy often as distraction, sin,
forgetfulness, satyrs, the inability to promise etc - another link within
the line (talking about my line here, strange) is that the goat is
about to be sodomised hence "spread like a..", goat sex also slipped into
that history at certain flashpoints

I like writing about goats, little seem-stricken critters

I have notice that a certain kind of simile occurs in "creative writing"
poems.  I call it the "pseudo-profound" simile.  It used to make me wince
in poetry readings.  On the other hand there is the "New York school"
simile; an example I recall is "useless as a ski on a barge" or "useless
as a ski."  I think I came across it in relation to Kenneth Koch.  I also
like epic similes.

Similes make easy targets because they are so blatantly
stupid--unless they are used with some irony.  Pound & Williams use them
sparingly if at all. WCW condemns them in Spring & All I believe.

Curious that he fails to comprehend that the Islamic idea is essentially one
of hierarchical understanding where all other ideas, other than their own,
take a relative to each other place determined by that "higher
understanding". For example, non believers as to god fall beneath pagans who
believe there are many gods and pagans are the basement of spiritual
existence according to Islam. At least according to what little I know of
(degreed in the study of religions and philosophies). They reject the idea
outright that Jesus, whom they say was a prophet, was crucified.

It all seems very silly to me. To paraphrase Bertrand Russell.
Though I do not share his beliefs either.

The rejection by Islamic people is interesting in that the Rabbi agrees,
since he is still waiting for the Jewish messiah, which puts the Jewish and
the Islamic groups into bitter conflict again. There is no awaited messiah
in Islamic beliefs. Something more to fight about, when not laughing about it.

Keep in mind that studies show that there were around 60 or more messiahs in
the mid eastern region of the Roman Empire at around the same time. They all
followed the same pattern, but are less well known. One canot but suspect
the work of the Roman censors (Roman Empire version of a CIA, and not simply
bean counters), who devised a clever plot to quell some nasty rebellions.

So there is a guy going around telling the oppressed to live like the lilies
of the fields and give unto Caesar what is Caesar's. The people suspected an
agent of Rome and wanted to off him. They chose to save another guy, even
though the local Roman governor tried to convince the people otherwise, by
humiliating to gain popular sympathy. Crown of thorns and drag a Tau through
the streets failed to get the desired effect. Word had gotten around the guy
was a Roman spy. What to do then ?  The Romans were clever. Their mystery
cults, and each legion had one of their own, had death and ressurection
rituals, to prepare warriors for battle. Common enough in such cultures, but
they also were very clever with drugs. Where then does John Allegro's thesis
concerning the Sacred Mushroom and the Cross come into it ?  Shades of
Amanita Muscaria mushroom myths ?  What if
the Romans induced coma and got their man off the cross before he perished.
Then put him into a cave, which only the Roman engineers (clever fellows
that they were) were able to open and close ?  Ah, instant ressurection. Add
an eclipse courtesy of the Roman knowledge of astronomy and it's done, a
convincing spectacle of death and resurrection. A last ditch effort to
convince the rebels not to rebel against Rome. The victim walks around with
his stigmata, and then is whisked off, according to the legends again, to a
grand tour of the empire, including a visit to Rome. Ah, how did Rome become
the seat, and why did Roman emperors use the idea so readily later, rather
than some other place ?  Grand tours, and secret meetings with the emperor
himself, were common for those who had served the emperor so exceptionally.
In any instance the fellow had to be whisked away out of the mid east before
someone caught on to what had happened.

A further corollary to it all. The fellow chosen by the censors, might have
been Herod's own son. Why ? Herod tried to find and kill him, and the legend
has it that he was a son of the lord. Herod was the lord. It was common for
kings and nobility to take whatever women they wanted, whenever they wanted,
but it was always a non event if the woman was of non noble origins.
(Meaning it never happened.) Any conception was simply immaculate. Of course
such origins lead to a very strange life, having come from what was
invariably, in those days, divine kingship. Initiation, and usefulness in a
leadership role, were inevitable.

Similar to Buddha, who was a prince, and whose immense desire for power led
him to a kind of shadow government, imposing pacificism on would be rebels,
during a time of potential upheaval. Very successful in maintaining the
existing government in power, simply because he seemed so non political.
Nevertheless, Buddha was power hungry, and the more followers who lived
"like the lilies of the fields" and gave unto their political lords in the
manner of "give unto Caesar what is Caesar's" the merrier. (If you see the
Buddha on the road...kill him....takes on a whole new meaning.)

So there you have another plausible interpretation of the myth, or a variant
on The Life of Brian...humming "always look on the bright side of life"...

The rabbi likely would have enjoyed that also.

Could the laughter be something very political.

Couldn't resist sending you all this little poem after reading Jonathan's
post, so, here goes...  -m.


        SIMILE

        He was like
        a trickster.  Elizabeth
        Bishop once said

        that a simile
        should be true

        in at least
        two ways.  Mine
        is, then, disqualified.

        He *was* like
        a trickster, this

        is true; but
        only in the
        sense that his

        penis was detachable;
        and even this

        is misleading, since
        it was only
        detachable once and

        with difficulty; as
        such, he was

        only like a
        trickster once.  After
        that he was

        more like an
        emergency room patient.

It may be that our collective interest in the metaphor and metonymy thread
as it relates to experimental poetry is waning at this point, in which
case I would be glad to continue this back-channel.  Not to be too obtuse,
but I think the concepts of domain and mapping, as presented in the Lakoff
quotation (is a quotation a metonym?) seem too positivistic, in the sense
that they seem to assume a certain isomorphism between domains (perhaps the
book addresses this elsewhere).  Or maybe I just want consider the implications
of some of the passive verb constructions in the quote that Jonathan usefully
provided:  "In metaphor the logic of the source domain structure is mapped
onto the logic of the target domain structure."  Does it makes a difference
here to ask what is doing the mapping?  (It can't be the metaphor since then
then definition would be circular.)  How would these ideas and questions
help to describe and promote (or fail to) some kinds of experimental
writing?  Don's interest in the "ragged edge of difference" in these
mappings could also maybe be useful to think about poems such as Schwerner's
Tablets, or Retallack's "Afterimages,"  or something like this section from
Peter Inman's "stead" from his book "criss cross" (now there's a suggestive
subject heading for a post):

Take that, rosy-fingered dawn.  Perhaps I don't know enough about Inman's
work, but I would say that this "stanza" seems relevant to the question
that started this whole thread.  And to its subsequent adumbrations: the
punctuation carves up the "lines" into domains that provisional and
irrefutable. (are.  Reading it requires a rehersal of our mapping-procedures
such we need to ask "What is a line?" and "what might a line be/not be?"

No? Wait, whad I say?

Hmmmm . . .
This is an interesting theory on Jesus (a new one I have not yet heard).
Yet, what evidence is there that anybody thought Jesus a spy.  If you go
by the gospels (which seems to be the source of most of the facts in this
email), Jesus claimed to be God in a Jewish context and this is what
pissed everyone off, no one ever mentioned anything about being a spy.
Why did Rome need a spy that hung out with "sinners" and outcasts?  This
theory does not make sense to me.

To say that Jesus was Herod's son seems quite a stretch based on the
Bible.  Is there any outside evidence for this?

I'm new to this listserver . . . but what in the world does this have to
do with poetics?!

... so much of what we understand in discourse seems to me to be
"direct" ... mistaken maybe, maybe just impressions, not understanding.
I am challenging the notion that there is an indirect understanding.
Nada Gordon wrote, "Is there anything we understand in itself and not by
any
analogy whatsoever? Would that be *enlightenment*?" More problematical
for me than the meaning of "understand" is the meaning of "anything."

There seems to be a mechanistic notion of the relation between words and
things here...that is if "anything" refers to discourse. When I drink
wine, I do not experience it by analogy. When I read Nada's sentence, I
hear a desire for immedicacy--that seems to float off her words and does
not require mental acrobatics on my part to understand. That is my
impression and it may be rationally indefensible. I am trying to say
that the thing in itself is more likely to be a feeling rather than a
brick in the road. I suppose if the brick in the road gave me a feeling
that would be enlightenment (a religous epipnay).

When I analyze Nada's statement, I load it with irony. I have no sense
that this irony is intentional or the thing she wants to communicate,
but my mind now buzzes with associations between Kant, Enlightenment era
philosopy, the Age of Reason, the thing in itself, etc. None of what I
am doing now is by analagy; it is by association. I don't feel my mind
switching off as it follows its indirections.

What is politically or socially interesting to me about metaphor and
analogy is the way they their use can direct some one's thoughts, help
some one see. A bad simile is a wonderful attack on reason--a refusal to
allow the irrational to become rational, wonderfully irreveerent with
respect to a too precious sense of how language is supposed to work. My
sense of that irreverence is direct. I like it.

I wrote earlier that a "grammar of metonymic overlays is that of the
Canto's..." --by this I meant no more than the major structural device
in the Cantos is the overlay of image on image, of phrase on phrase,
passage on passage. Pound himself uses the word super-position to
describe his method of composition in his "Vorticism" where he also
attachs both symbolism and synechdoce, of I remember. From this I derive
the notion that it is the overlay of one field of images (or allusions)
on another that creates structural metaphors or what he calls the
"forma" in his essay "Medievalism."--near the end of the Cantos, he
likens each overlay to the facets of a crystal--the point seems to be a
centered overlay of transparent forms--something he experienced
"englightenment"--only intermittantly--politically, as differences
become drained of their particular importance he becomes more
totalitarian. By contrast, deleuze and Guattari, as their plateaus slide
over one another, they produce differences.

To my understanding, this is one of the crucial differences between
modernism and postmodernism. The structural metaphors, metaphors of
process, in modernism as represented by the Cantos are mraked by both
reverence and quasi-scientific notionas of rationalism. Pound, again in
"Vorticism" calls his method more like calculus than algebra, hence his
denegration of easy connections between meaning and figures of speech
like synechdoche.Still it seems to me that metaphor blossoms in ways
that transcend or thread or cause energy to run through the planes of
his composition. We see the rose in the steel dust. Christine Brooke
Rose is much better on this than I am ...

I for one can not see such roses or vortices as directly as he did--as
he hoped--they do not exist objectively for me. The forma does not
constrain my indirection and flight of association and I prize instead
that flight--that becomes my direct experience, one of decentered
flight, one of play ...

His enlightenment becomes my fake simile?  ... I am getting flakey now,
having reached the limits of my ability to maintain a faced of
coherence. The most important thing that I wanted to say is that even
direction is a form of immediate thought ... I don't now what
non-immediate thought is unless a deja vue slaps me in the face.

A super poem by super poet Prageeta Sharma (in AGNI 46--she's also in the
new Explosive Magazine):

PERFORMANCE

Detachment, as a general rule, scares me into traipse,
and into the kind of pedantry that composed for myself
erects more opulence, more human than feminine
nevertheless, I require food and heat,
falsify my walk to the drugstore on all fours
because of weak knees, botch the stutter
as a dog does when he has not yet succeeded in begging,
to eternalize the architecture, coffee shops
likewise your devotion,
behold the butcher with devil in eye
without soft mouth to substitute testimonial
to linger as wine in throat
to sip the throat, to care whether she has eaten,
in a form like this, I am contagious,
To claim Blake's MYRTLE TREE,
for my love, for my love, translucent mess,
a pageant, sun-down. We are on an amiable plight
to wave to an audience disappearing.

The seeming transcendence of metaphor (the carrying away from one plane to
another) depends on the maintenance of a metonymical division of labor always
in flux. This does not imply a hierarchy of tropic orders but rather a
complicity. Metaphor (the priesthood) needs metonymy (the police).

      since i tend to worry alot, i tend to revise.
      yet ocassionally i notice an unintentionally
      "politically uncorrect" metaphor creeping into a poem
      "too late" (after it's appeared in print)
      (as opposed to the "intentionally politically incorrect"
       metaphors I DO let people my work)...

      For instance, I write "sanity goes on strike" in a poem
      and I'm angry at myself (though the alliteration is 'nice'),
      because I'm looking at Ange Mlinko's poem MATINEE
      (which will be in her forthcoming book I think)
      which has a line:
      "and others laid off by sleep and asides"
      which makes me wish i had written
      "sanity lays me off" or "sanity takes away health benefits"
      etc......
      if some academic close-reader wants to accuse me of
      being bourgeois or something....assuming they still do that...
      nonetheless it's fun to worry i suppose about such things
      and is part of the flow as are ocassional fits of "intention"....

I am very interested in the way that "we" attach ideological value to
formal elements--tropes, poetic forms and meters (or absence of) etc... So
the recent posts by Louis Stroffolino and Kcglowworm (metaphor for George
Hartley) are thought-provoking.

I would contend that these attributions of value are themselves
metaphorical at bottom.  Parataxis is good because it isn't
hierarchical as hypotaxis, would be one example. I have had long arguments
with people about whether "open" form has anything to do with "openness."

This is what I meant when I asked the question: "must we allegorize our
tropes?"  That is, how much ideological baggage can the formal structure
of (poetic)  language bear?  I am wary of arguments that attribute value
(negative or positive) to form; yet isn't this what "poetics" itself
consists of?  Help me, please!

Brian Kim Stefans has a cute poem in the new Object/Tork dubl issue
        in which
   he speaks of
                the importance
   of Ashbery's Europe
                        for the new bourgeois poets
which is not to call anyone a close reader

same issue has fine work by Robt Kocik on a projected coop space in
Manhattan for poets .. and Drew Gardner's "Cell Walk" which is also in

the Jarnot Stroffolino Schwartz anthology

I expect Brian will forgive the characterization "cute"?

Chris,

That was a really nice post.

No, no one is going to call you bourgeois (except in gouldian vein,
dripping with irony).

If anyone was going to, it would be me, rest assured. (However I'm not an
academic..It's not the academics you have to worry about though: names'll
never hurt you:  we workers knee-cap bourgeois types, **at least**)

Nothing terrible about "sanity on strike" as you originally did it.
Strikes can actually be mobilized on occasion for incredibly reactionary
ends...The CIA is very big on this.  Most importantly, when Nixon and the
CIA were organizing their criminal fascist coup against Allende in Chile,
their spooks manipulated elements in the copper and other industries to
strike in order to weaken the economy and turn the population against the
government, lining up as much support as possible before the army struck.
There have been instances of strikes motivated by racism.  (..the Dodgers
*almost* wildcatted because of Jackie Robinson; only a few exceptionally
strong-willed and anti-racist guys talked the majority, who were
revoltingly racist, out of it; that would'a been a strike, and is always
refered to as such by people who were close to the incident.  But there
have also been larger-scale industrial examples)

I did enjoy the alternatives you considered.  (How about, my sanity
undergoes welfare reform...)

from the sanity barricades,
Mark the Red

THAT DOES IT


the preoccupation with its absence
becomes the means X uses
to achieve its mission without
betraying its identity. we don't
forget. we just don't say.
the deepest cover lies in surfaces.

flesh becomes an essay, a position
paper, a series of excisions from a code
book or a dictionary, an accretion
disk, a sentence. no time off
for good behavior. au contraire:
an exchange of vows the erasure of

the copula. spies make dreadful
poets, & only mediocre critics.
let's not call our new album
Spies for Love. let's not make that
An Anatomy of Eros, either.
Is it This, Is it That does it.

Dunno about the "several others," but I prefer to say what my point is
myself, Henry -- every single time.

There is no group take on nor objection to George Hartley, who is a really
interesting critic, even tho I'm dishing him a mile a minute just in order
to provoke him *or someone* into something fun. In fact, if there *is* a
group take on his point, I'm going to have to switch sides in a minute, and
him and me will spot you as many points as you name and make those and that
many more.

Ganging up on someone just ain't my way; when I want a fight, I get right
out in front and swing.

It is not -- my point that is -- btw, that "this characterization... is
...abstract."

Abstract is cool, it's modern, it's jazz, shades, a beret, a goatee. It's a
martini or a perfect rob roy, Billy Strayhorn Lenny Tristano Schmuel
Trigano, and all that weltschmerz joiedevivre thing. I like abstract, I
want abstract, it's wild that George is abstract. Lets all be way more
abstract, man, dig?

Subject:      dishing fork and spooning
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I'm delighted if I have in the slightest help to stir up the mare's nest
soup in this teakettle-tempest of tenpins we bowl online if unalined.

George Hartley is "using the terms "metaphor" and "metonymy"
metaphorically...
not talking about language... (but) about ...(to use a metaphor)
ideological terrain, a concept ...mostly from Althusser and, after him,
Laclau and Mouffe."

To distinguish ideological terrain from language I am not able. I read
Althusser pretty closely when he first appeared, with what then appeared as
something new to say, but I've been luckier since and have only glanced off
Laclau and like the asteroid and earth will have entirely missed Mouffe.
Perhaps they are able to make the distinction w/o causing "either metaphor
or metonymy (to) lie there innocently as tools at hand" in language as
apparently they do not in that more colorful ideo-apellation.

George asks: "to what degree... (do metaphor and metonymy) shape our
conception of the relationships they establish rather than simply express."
I.e. to what degree do they shape rather than express relationships."

Hmmm. There is no question in this question is there?

The *whole activity* of metaphor is to shape our conceptions. Both when we
use it as a tool, and in the underlying sense that *all* conception is
metaphor (note and unpack the word "underlying" just a moment ago or
"unpack" even more recently: these are counters of a metaphorical system
whereby we understand mental activities by way of physical ones. Note the
word "understand" -- the same system is *in* that word. Note the word "in"
which is a counter of the metaphorical system of container/contained, part
of the same system I mentioned earlier in this paren. I hope the
overwhelming nature of the mind/metaphor connection is starting to sink in
[note the physical metaphor: "sink in]).

Metonymy on the other hand, precisely "expresses" rather than establishes a
relationship. When we say "Wyatt was buried in the country" and mean in a
cemetary in the country, we are simply expressing an existing semantic
field (no, not the one in which he lies buried!). We are *not* mapping two
semantic fields, but as it were folding the one semantic field to make
items which are related actually touch for the moment (of the sentence).
(And those who have read the preceding para will recognize in "folding"
another physical metaphor for a mental act) (and those who have read modern
physics will recognize that I took the metaphor from one that's often used
to understand how *conceptions of* space/time might work).

All this to return to his original point, that metaphor is somehow
"vertical" and therefore somehow "metaphysical" (i.e. vertical means
distinctions of "height" and "height" implies ontology...?? or...?) and
that metonymy is somehow "horizontal" and therefore somehow...
investigative? makes new connections?"

The point is, that is entirely incorrect. Not above 180 degrees off (nor
below), as I said to myself -- and to you -- when I read his words. Just
like my "fork ran away with the spoon" (as someone pointed out, it was the
dish who did it). I was wrong about the fork and the spoon, George is wrong
about metaphor and metonymy.

If, as Hartley goes on, "this distinction may in many ways itself be a
tired one", i.e. the fashion for using it has passed, perhaps it is because
it is so often misused, abused, ill-used, used, i.e., to say that which is
not true.

"...but I found it useful for a particular discussion of kafka" -- Yes,
well if the room is interesting, a lock is useful to inhibit access.

Ok, now lets hear from George. This kind of stuff beats having to sweep
Adorno's ashes out of the room, that's for sure!

That was a very bizarre, arm-waving exercise (if not just unforgettable). I
think that what is meant by, "render unto Caesar what is Caesar's" is
completely missed here. Are we meek?

Close Listening

Poetry and the Performed Word

Edited by CHARLES BERNSTEIN

Close Listening and the Performed Word brings together seventeen essays,
especially written for this volume, on the poetry reading, the sounds of
poetry, and the visual performance of poetry. While the performance of
poetry is as old as poetry itself, critical attention to modern and
postmodern poetry performance has been negligible. This collection opens
many new avenues for the critical discussion of the sound and performance
of poetry, with special attention to innovative work. More important, the
essays collected here offer wide-ranging elucidations of how
twentieth-century poetry has been practiced as a performance art. The
contributors cover topics that range from the performance styles of
individual poets and types of poetry to the relation of sound to meaning,
from historical and social approaches to poetry readings and to new
imaginations of prosody. Such approaches are intended to encourage new
forms of "close listenings"--not only to the printed text of poems, but
also to tapes, performances, and other expressions of the sounded word.
With readings and "spoken word" events gaining an increasing audience for
poetry, Close Listening provides an indispensable critical groundwork for
understanding the importance of language in--and as--performance.

No idea. I reside in what is essentially a media blackout.
Unless you consider the www a part of the media.

Actually the future of poetry might be that the poet must face the muse,
not the audience, and read the poetry, while they remain riveted to their
pews outside the railing that divides the stage from the public.

In what language ?  I wonder if that really matters.

Of course the same thing happens when textual material is presented, not as
live spoken word, or read from relatively immutable hard copy Guttenbergian
style printed text, but is a multi media presentation that synthesizes sound
through the mediumship of the midi sonic wafer that resides in the sanctum
of the cyber circuits.

Is there such a thing as *progression* in metaphor, do you think?  For
example, such experiences as nursing a baby provide a wealth of metaphor
in Shakespeare, though they are unlikely to be dealt with in themselves.
Historically, do some subjects break into metaphor before direct
treatment?  At some point, does the metaphorical burden become
overburdened, and spill out into the primary are of concern?  Or is, in
fact, metaphor the primary area of concern in poetry: the ostensible
subject being merely a gloss or a net on the more fugitive and dynamic
metaphor?  These trucks, these metaphors, just who and what are they
moving in/out?

Could be shadow leadership, same as Buddha. Makes perfect sense of all the
elements of the story. Buddha was a Simon says who was not in direct line of
immediate succession, but as an apparent outsider to the inner workings of
secular power, people tended to trust and follow him. After all he had, as
had Jesus, come down from high up there, to the commoners' level. Therefore
he could influence the maintaining of the secular political order under the
veil of a spirituality.

Jesus is somewhat the same, according to that theory.

Besides that, Jesus and Buddha used language in ways that were different
from most other people of their time periods. Jesus appears poetic even if
political.

I sense that some poets have had the same fate, even if in lesser ways, of a
kind of imputed shadow leadership. Was Ginsberg, for instance, a shadow
president to Nixon ?  It would make for an interesting doctoral thesis.

Though poets also tend to get the opposite. They seem to be looked upon by
the commoners' level as rising too far up out of it, and then they tend to
have some want to pull them down again to a lower level than all the other
commoners. Then truly only a lord can save them. Once that was the role of
the nobility, and then of the patron. Perhaps that is because of the
traditional mystification of the nature of language, and the use of language
once viewed as almost wholly allied only to political and spiritual power.
The poet then a kind of usurper of that cultural usage that concerns
language as being properly thought of as the language of command. The
commoner sometimes fearing, envious, mocking, and jealous, of the poet's
potential prowess.

>I'm new to this listserver . . . but what in the world does this have to
>do with poetics?!

I was following a thread, but further divergence does seem a little out of
place, unless discussing the nature of standards as to the true verse and
the perverse, of twisted meaning and truth. Is Buddha truth or twisted ?  Is
Jesus truth or twisted ?  Is the bible truth or twisted ?  Is the poet,
whomever the poet is, truth or twisted ?  Is poetry the twist itself, or the
antithesis of the twist and the twistings twisted political aggenda ?  I
think - the latter.

There is also the idea that scripture is the only true and acceptable verse
and all poetics is an abomination. No longer a common standpoint nowadays,
thank the muses. Nevertheless, I assure you that that is not a standpoint
that post-modern poets are wholly immune from suffering through. Been there,
done that....virtually....(pun intended). Also the burdens of prophecy, and
poetics as a kind of prophetic and therefore systemically hated action. The
poet as prophet is also a been there, done that kind of thing, and equally I
believe meant to urge poets to abandon the art and become more Puritanical
and proper as to someone else's idea of what spirituality ought to be. The
poet urged to give up the craft of poetry, by means of an increase in
hardships is I think a persistent theme, even in the current as opposed to
historical contextual situatedness. It all becomes very complicated.

Poetry as shadow leadership ?  No further comment. Some people do tend to
follow the strangest things, at the strangest times. Nevertheless, I do
attempt precision as to intentional meaning, as well as concentrating on
authenticity when I myself write, and I write almost every day. Poet as wise
?  I would make no claims as to wisdom. That brings other kinds of
contentions concerning poet a as traditional fool, spiritaul harlequin, and
court jester.

So the subjects are all loosely connected. Another pun imbedded in that.

Perhaps best to spin the weathervane of poetical discussion back towards
its more mainstreamed direction.... <chuckle>

We had better return from this diversion to one of the other channels.

I was wondering about this metapoetry. Essays.

I was trying to read the Benetton ad backwards
as it was reflected in the bus window glass
on the way to work.

But i couldn't. the billboard performance
was a double exposure at the stop-light
performance.

OUP didn't have the virtual reality CD
that I could play in my Sony.

So I listened close.

What is "cruisingfiction" Are we talking Kerouac here?


While I would agree that the Caesars of this world will use whatever means to
achieve their ends (re: Mark Prejsnar's post today in which the CIA spooks
provoked strikes thus bringing about a desired end), this has nothing to do
with the famous words of Jesus from the gospels. It is a whole lot more obvious
than all that -- the implied ownership of the thing with the owners face
imprinted on it (Caesar), which has always been the case with currency: it
always returns to its owner (is expected to). Of course, there is also a more
spiritual idea there -- that of association with an unseen kingdom espoused by
Jesus rather than the seen. Kinda gives a new perspective on having to pay
taxes there. It is at once a subtle and obvious answer to a loaded question and
can't be considered complete in its meaning without the other part, "and render
unto God what is his."

Don't worry, I'll save you!  I think you hit on it yourself at the end of
your post: "poetics" consists of the mapping of value (aesthetic,
ideological, emotional, etc.) onto form (e.g., attributing "openness" to
"free verse," or selecting the pantoum structure to convey ennui).  Now, of
course this is arbitrary and irrational, but that's how conventions get
started.  And convention lies at the root of poetic expression, even the
most radical langpo improv.

There is a complex but finite set of possible psychological responses to
any linguistic structure: the range of that set is wider or narrower
depending on the directness and familiarity of the conventions involved,
and when the structure in question is deliberately antagonistic to or
evasive of given conventions, this resistance generally produces a more
complex but still determined set of possible responses, which incorporates
the fact of resistance into its gradations of intelligibility.  Thus a
poem, for instance, in which "normal" relations of reference, syntax,
logic, etc., are subverted, produces a familiar (within the context of
langpo culture) recognition of certain stances--ironic, disaffected,
anti-lyrical, and so forth.  That recognition in turn comes to be
associated (through a metonymic process) with the "forms" of langpo in
general.  An example might be the instant flush of tonal awareness one
experiences upon seeing a line that looks like this

nuptially (first. has toboggan(

at once alerts the reader to several conventions: 1) the convention of
areferentiality, of words communicating through their "random" selection
the meaning of the impossibility of the communication of meaning; 2) the
convention of asyntacticality, of words marshalled carefully into an order
that signifies the lack of order; 3) the convention of faux punctuation; 4)
the convention of the withholding of closure, and so on.  All these
conventions together elicit a judgment.  This judgment may be one of
approval, disapproval, or neutrality, but it is always a judgment of value,
involving as it does the automatic identification (and
placing-into-perspective-with-one's-own-alignment) of ideological positions.

Metaphor has no qualitative essence of its "own," because there is no such
thing as metaphor-as-such; metaphor is always a metaphor _of_ something.
Within the familiar "genres" of metaphor (epic simile, allegory, blazon,
etc.), there are obvious and utterly conventional responses grounded in the
awareness of those associations.  More complex responses occur when these
associations are breached: when an epic simile, for example, is used to
describe a bake sale, or when one refers to "the great inflatable tomahawk
that is Rhode Island."  Metaphor, that is, takes on value to the extent
that it departs from conventionality, so that all figural assignment of
value militates toward a veering into catachresis.  I know there is some
disagreement about this, but I do think that it is the "abuse" of metaphor
rather than "metaphor itself" that generates the mapping of value in
question.  It is only when familiar forms are transmutated or deformed that
we start to feel some way about them.

I could go on about how our association of certain forms with "love,"
"nationalistic fervor," "goofiness," etc., arises not merely from arbitrary
conventions but from a tension between the passive recognition of those
conventions and the reactive anxiety that results from transgressions
thereof, but I am getting very sleeeeeeeepy

Clunk.

For those in the NYC area: Rolf Belgum, brother of innovative fictioneer Erik
Belgum (whose _Star Fiction_ Detour Press published in 1996), will be screening
his documentary "Driver 23" at the New York Underground Film Festival this
coming Saturday at Anthology Film Archives, 4:15 p.m.

This is the most hilarious low-budget film I've seen since George Kuchar's
"Corruption of the Damned." Rather than blather on about it myself, I'll attach
a "spotlight" piece on Belgum that appeared in last week's _City Pages_
(Minneapolis). Hope to see you all there! --Gary

TAPPING INTO METAL


by James Diers


Passion Play: Rocker Dan Cleveland has
"an overwhelming personality" in the
local rock-doc parody Driver 23.

Truth may not always be stranger than fiction, but it's a hell of a lot
cheaper.
Just ask Rolf Belgum, the Minneapolis filmmaker whose latest
feature-length documentary, Driver 23, was shot on a budget of $700.

"I'm amazed at what passes for 'low-budget indie films' these days," says
Belgum. "At some of these [indie film] festivals, you'll be going up against
million-dollar films that are somehow still considered 'underground.'"

In the spirit of the most earnest DIY director, Belgum spent a year and a
half--sans crew and equipment, just a handheld video camera--getting inside
the mind of Dan Cleveland, a Minneapolitan courier/rocker whose raw
exploits are an uncanny, real-life mutation of Rob Reiner's This Is Spinal
Tap. From basement rehearsals with his Ryan's-ready metal band, Dark
Horse, to quiet reflections in the bathtub (a la Tap's Mick Shrimpton), the
film digs into Cleveland's true rock & roll story with Cassavetes-esque
candor. Not only are the results strangely spellbinding, they're often
hysterical. Interviews with Cleveland's on-again/off-again bandmates read
like the sharpest of parody--e.g., "Dan's got a sweet voice...when he stays in
his range"--except that they're real.

"A lot of people think it's made-up or scripted because Dan's delivery is so
tight," says Belgum. "But it's all real. He feels that comfortable in front of
a
camera." Indeed, with the aid of assorted anti-depressants, Cleveland is an
organic deadpan delight whose passion for amateur physics is matched only
by his penchant for goateed power chords and self-analysis. As Belgum puts
it, "He is his own favorite subject."

Though local screenings have been few and far between, Driver 23
(formerly known as Frontman) seems to have already infiltrated elite rock
circles in the Pacific Northwest. A couple of members of the stalwart Seattle
band The Walkabouts, former Twin Cities residents themselves, got hold
of a video copy last year. They reportedly took to sharing the tape with
various friends who came to visit their recording studio, including members
of grunge-band survivors Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains. Charmed by the
film's priceless verite banter, even Eddie Vedder's pals are apparently
stunned to learn that Cleveland's not putting on an act. Can a cult following
of Spinal proportions be far behind?

To his credit, Belgum opted not to directly engage any broader agendas in
the film, even though elements like Cleveland's interracial marriage or the
anatomy of the local rock scene provided ample opportunity. "Had I wanted
to apply for grant money to fund my movie, that would've been the way to
go," he quips. "But Dan's personality is so overwhelming, there's hardly any
room for anything else." . . .

New collage and installation work by Nigerian visual artist, Fatimah Tuggar,
can be seen in two current shows in New York: "Keeping up with the Joneses"
(New Museum) and "Esperanto 98" (Jack Tilton Gallery). Tuggar, who is currently
homeless, creates (among other things) stunning collages, somewhat reminiscent
of those of Jess Collins, combining peopled photographs taken mostly in
northern Nigeria with images clipped from First world magazines. Often
humorous, always provocative & disturbing, Tuggar's work can be seen on the web
for those of you not in the NYC area:

Not TOO many professorial comments about metaphor and metonomy today -- (and
by the way, Tom M. [bereted, goateed, huddled over in the corner of that
coffee house with Clement Greenberg snapping his fingers to Monk] I think we
can safely assume that Henry Gould is PROBABLY well-informed about the major
developments of art in the 20th century, and was objecting more to a certain
academese that's haunted this thread rather than the word "abstract")
-- so it may be time for me to opine that Linda Russo's now somewhat
plaintive question that began this thread, and also Nada's recent question,
namely "is there anything that we understand in and by itself and without
the aid of analogy?" seem to have gotten very short shrift.

Chris Stroffolino, back-cover boy (nice poem, though!), wrote a few days
back that he was suspicious of the "anti-metaphorical tendency" -- but
wasn't such a tendency a main project of the Black Mountain folks, to get
away from what Olson called the suck of symbol, from the universe of
discourse, from what he called, in the Letter to Elaine Feinstein, the
"classical-representational" as opposed to the "primitive abstract"? And
let's not forget "I",  who keeps asking the Gunslinger in Book One what a
certain event was LIKE. "Like, boy? What's that mean? Were you HERE or not?"
I think these and other works were positing ATTENTION and PERCEPTION as more
valuable qualities than linguistic INVENTION and ORNAMENT: "Be here now and
then."

I of course can't argue with the folks who claim that ALL our language is
metaphorical (though mainly unconscious dead metaphors) -- nor with my old
teacher Norman O. Brown, who ended _Love's Body_ with the prescient remark
"All is metaphor: there is only poetry" -- but one indication of really BAD
poetry is surely the overuse of such devices? Here's a poem called

YOU WANT MORE

Here are three cancer spots:
Skin.
Stomach.
Bone.
You can take your pick, but everyone
Wants skin.
Once in Houston, Texas,
I saw a car full of sparrows.
They looked like nothing else.
Of your friends:
How many take pills to sleep?
How many drink themselves to sleep?
How many would take for themselves your illness?
My friend,
Last night I walked outside
And watched the stars do nothing at all unusual.
Ask anyone:
Describe the stars.
That's exactly how they looked.
And even
If I dressed them up as children,
Gave them wagons, cakes, and birthday boots,
Then broke their fingers one by one until they said
It's only you they shine for,
I know what you'd want:
You'd want more.

(by Jim Krusoe) There's lots I still like about this 22-year-old poem, but
one of them is the implied anti-metaphorical (thus, pro "world-as-it-is")
stance -- I'm sure that's not a properly mediated statement, Joe Amato, but
I've always valued work (like Bob Grenier's "Curriculum of the Soul" piece
"Attention") that moves us IN rather than AROUND, AWAY . . . .

How WAS "Adorno's Ashes?" I didn't know he was Irish!

It's interesting we're putting on the gloves while the Pope is making
his play for reconciliation (cards close to the chest, gloves on).
I always thought "I" was the Pope (metapharisaically speaking).

Not only was Jesus a Jew (NEWSFLASH), but so were Peter and Paul.
Speaking of P's, did you know that Poe's Pym hits dead center (numerically
speaking) when ship Grampus arrives at Peter & Paul rocks in mid-Atlantic?
What does that mean?  It means that Jesus was from outer space, obviously.

Jesus MAY have been a Pharisee - but remember, G-d (or was it Pnin?)

  This question occured to me, before I got mr. safdie's comments,
  so i will ask it first:
  When people speak of "metaphor," they often say "metaphor for"
  (I do it too), but isn't saying "metaphor for", strictly speaking,
  an improper use of the term? Not that I'm suggesting that we,
  as poets, necessarily should be "strictly speaking", but some
  synchronization of terms might be helpful.....

  Now, if metaphor, or a metaphor cannot be "translated", or is,
  in some way, "irreducible", wouldn't such a metaphor qualify
  as "anything that we understand in and of itself without the aid
  of analogy" (Nada, or Safdie quoting Nada), or some kind of
  "primitive abstract"? When confronted with metaphor read as thus
  one need not respond as Dorn's "I" (What's that mean? What's that
  LIKE? etc). Or, if one does one is not going to come any closer to
  the "meaning". I think the distinction between seeing a metaphor
  as a metaphor and seeing it as a metaphor "for" something is the
  crucial distinction here. When one says "X is a metaphor for Y,"
  one is really speaking of analogy, not metaphor.
  all (is a metaphor) for now, chris

This is my final post on this tetchy non-poetics topic, and I will be brief.
After what Europe & the Church did to the Jews - and does to this day in
the scenario of some parts of the gospels - no one is in a position to
scold them for being alienated or antagonistic toward organized Christianity.

The project of Peter & Paul was, in a sense, to make Jews of all mankind,
and so far you have to admit they have been successful in a number of ways.
Unsuccessful in others.

I guess I would agree with what maybe J. Joyce would think:  if God is a
Person, she must be the God of Here-Comes-Everybody. Her name, by the
way, is Beatrice, and she lives in Sioux Falls, North Dakota - where she
runs a movie house and is an active member of the Church of the Frisbee-
Tossin' Jesus.

The "render unto Caesar" debate occurred within the pharisaic movement; you
can find all sides of the debate represented as artefacts and consciously
in lots of early midrashic texts and in the Mishnah. Even Jesus's parabolic
way of representing the issue -- whose face is on the coin? -- occurs in
that literature I believe (but it would take a scholar to come up with a
citation).

Those were revolutionary times, and the debate was not about meekness,
personal ethics, living in or apart from the political, but rather about
what attitude a Jew ought to have (and since these were rabbis, ought to

Were they good because they created roads and their law kept someone off
us? Etc.

60 messiahs? someone said.

Remember, the idea of "messiah" had *nothing* (zero, zilch) to do with a
divine being (and only metaphorically to do with the saving of souls)
before the romanifying of Judaic ideas into Xtianity.

The vision was of what we would call a world revolution (gee I always
wondered why the European left had so many Jews in it...). The messiah was
to be a king (descendant of King David and therefore a rightful king) who
would lead the movement to that order, in which swords would be beaten into
plowshares and the whole world would view Jerusalem as its center.

T'were the Romans who had human gods, gods with sons (and daughters),
humans impregnated by divine beings, etc (well... there is a reference to
gods lying with women in Genesis, I believe, to create the race of
"Giants"). And foisted on my mojo such notions as virgin birth.

Some of you may have noticed that "first will be last" didn't actually
happen. Yet, the world religion built on that Jewish idea (oppressed/exiled
idea -- it's not essentialistically Jewish as is obvious I hope) rules on.
We live in Rome.

Language being so much more interesting than ideas, the phrase
"Adorenoashes" makes me think of Adonis -- the contemporary Arabic poet. I
just ordered his "Intro to Arab Poetics" (hope that title is right) from
Amazon. Anyone read it?

i really didn't wanna touch the metaphor thread, as it seems to me that
these distinctions are useful primarily to the extent you're willing to
read (and write) such & such a way... i.e., "touching threads"... or, "with
due regard for" somebody or other's instrumental definitions of same...
lakoff may be a smart guy, but i find that the leap to cognition (if that's
what it is---it surely is in the case of mark turner) that you end up with
is probably a reduction, at least when you start talking specific
metaphorical constructs (in specific poems) as opposed to process... i.e.,
i think metaphor/metonymy are really so sociocultural insofar as how we use
such devices---when such devices are being put to use, as it were...

but joe s brings me out simply to say that i used the word "mediated" in my
posts to gabe b/c i wanted to provoke/emphasize an awareness of media...
and b/c the notion of "unmediated visions" and such is a relatively easy
one to come by... but "mediated" really is more metaphorical (!) than
anything else... which is to say, perhaps a word like "constitutive" would
have been more to the point?... a different metaphoricity at stake here?
(my but don't i sound professorial!)... well that's not my point, anyway...
mediated:  as i "see" it, it's not that there's something "between" my
understanding of a thing and the thing itself (dasein etc.)... it's that
language, mind, culture, etc., constitutes perception of said thing...
which for my money, is not *all* the thing is... nor is it *all* we may
likely believe it to be... for "thing" substitute "person" or "self" or
"god" and it all gets so---sticky?... in any case, i can't think, at this
"point" in my life, w/o thinking *through*, or i think as joe indicates,
*in*... to think *in* is still to constitute an object through thought
('mediated by thought'?)... metaphor in the most general sense, as in
'everything may be metaphorical,' indicated by my persistent use of
"quotes"... well i can put the entire post in quotes, of course...

i can just imagine what the philosophers among you might say...

but hey, recall olson re the human universe, "we are ourselves both the
instrument of discovery and the instrument of definition"... i think this
is to the "point"... setting aside my metaphors here (like, as though i
could!):  whence actual knowledge, proprioceptive or otherwise, given such
a "state of affairs"?... perhaps it's *like* the old---joke?

'a man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a metphor"?...

that seems to be the deficit. If that fails remediation as to intentional

Hi, Tom.

        Adonis presents a rich and readable explanation of Arab poetics from
orality to modernity, e.g., "Language... is not a tool for communicating
a detached meaning. It is meaning itself because it is thought. Indeed,
it precedes thought and is succeeded by knowledge. This implies that the
criterion of meaning was contained in language itself, and was defined
by the rules of language" (82). He maintains a dual perspective--poetic
and sociohistorical--and helps to calibrate the compass.
        You might also find interesting Harold Coward's _Sacred Word and Sacred
Text: Scripture in World Religions_. (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis, 1988). ISBN
0-88344-604-9 (pbk). Also his _The Sphota Theory of Language_. (Delhi:

I know this is all unpoetic, but I can not help but comment on such
statements as these:

>The project of Peter & Paul was, in a sense, to make Jews of all mankind,
>and so far you have to admit they have been successful in a number of ways.
>Unsuccessful in others.

Peter and Paul were cetainly Jews, but where in the world does the idea
that they wanted to make everyone Jews come from.  So much of the New
Testament (written by Paul) tells the Jews not to force Old Testament law
on Gentile Christians (particularly circumcision, the primary "mark" of a
Jew).  It is true that Christianity as taught by Paul embraces Jewish
history and scriptures, but his goal was not to expand the Israelite
nation.  One of the themes of the Bible is that "all nations will be
blessed through Israel."  First Israel will be blessed, then the whole
world.  So Israel and Jewish history was simply a starting point, not an
end (to Paul).

I don't know, perhaps I entered this "conversation" to late . . .

Yes, I have -- it is a terrific book -- Adonis is a terrific poets and
thinker -- unhappily too much is not yet translated, though a few poems from
one of the latest books were done excellenty by Allen Hibbard & Osama Isber
(published in SULFUR).  That poem "A desire moving through the maps of the
material" is also reprinted in Millennium Vol II as is a theoretical text
from 1992. I am right now translating a few exceprts from a book of essays
called LA PRIERE ET L'EPEE. Superb work.  -- Pierre

To quickly pick up two threads, one old -- the metaphor discussion --, one new --
Tom's query re Adonis --, here the last chapter, of a longish Adonis essay on Arab
poetics & involving metaphor. The modern poets he speaks of are those of the
Abassid period, i.e. Abu Tamman, Ibn al-Mu'tazz, Abu Nuwas & Co., inventing  urban
modern poetics some 800 to 1000 years before Baudelaire & co. were on the
euro-scene. This is an insta-translation, as I type, so, please excuse mistapes...
Pierre

ADONIS -- ChapterXIV of “THE FIXED AND THE MOBILE; TRADIITON AND INNOVATION IN
ARAB CULTURE”

During pre-islamic times, poetry imitated man who, in turn, imitated poetry. And
man thus saw himself in his own mirror. Poetry spoke life; life spoke poetry.
 After the advent of Islam, poetry became but a simple part of a larger whole --
the islamic vision of the world. While poetic content submitted itself to
religious power, form remained attached to the pre-islamic language.
 It’s only with the beginning of the Omeyyad period that poetry started to
distance itself from religion. Islam by then had become a simple external social
and political frame. But the real poetic revolution took place in the Abassid
era.(1) It consisted in an interrogation of the question of origin: is the latter
truly perfect? Is it really impossible to go beyond it? The answer that was
reached was of course negative —  creation being, precisely, synonymous with
origin. Now, in the matter of poetic creation, no origin can, in the absolute, be
better than any other. Creation being a stranger to time, “modern” poetry can
indeed surpass “ancient” poetry. The criterion no longer resides in the
ancientness or the modernity as such: ancient creation and modern creation can
thus meet. The “innovating” poets of the Abassid period thus show the way that the
contemporary poets have found again.
 Today, creation has to move in the direction of transgressing the know, towards
producing the new or the unknown.  The relationship between tradition and creation
is no longer a relation of cause and effect. Furthermore, the time of the former
is different from that of the latter.  The work is simultaneously contemporary and
non-contemporary. The moment of creation does not necessarily correspond to
historical moment of the tradition. The creator lives simultaneously in all times.
The moment of the work may not partake in the predominant taste;  anyway, it is
the great works which create this taste, always.
 It is in the dialectic of the apparent and the hidden, of the visible and the
invisible that this “time of the creation” has expressed itself. And it is thanks
to that dialectic that the way opens to go beyond the fixed traditional image of
religion. This dialectic has also permitted the emergence of the riches of
language and poetry, and of creative experience in general, the principle domain
of which was metaphor, the essential dimension of interpretation.
 As metaphor is the artistic form of thought, traditonalism rejected it just as it
had rejected the doctrine of interpretation. For the traditionalist current,
everything that’s written in the Koran is literally true; God’s language cannot be
metaphorical. What is called “metaphor” in the language of the Koran thus
represents a reality whose essence we are ignorant of. If poetry wants to be
religious, it has to abandon metaphor. Indeed, in the traditionalists’ mind
metaphor is akin to a kind of “magic,” consisting in substituting the false for
the true.
 But the poets, without worrying about it, keep on using metaphor, and poetry
becomes resolutely pluri-simensional, gifted with a plurality of meanings. Thus
metaphor has had the virtue of “opening” a language which until then was “closed.”
This is the great lesson of that “modernity” of which the “innovators” of the
Abassid period were the precursors.
 This revolution has produced a new poetic language which, rather than describing
the apparent in itself, proposes to unveil its meaning. The unveiling thus becomes
the goal of all utterance. No matter the certainties or the teachings, what is
essential is to open the doors of the imagination. This new conception of language
achieved three major changes. The first consisted in proposing that the
imagination lies at the origin of the world; the second, that the criterion for
evaluating poetic experience lies in the transgression of the ordinary and the
common. The third consisted in recommending a perpetual invention of new forms.
Form is no longer the image of the poem-object, but the image of the relation, in
the poem, between the poet and the world. Form has become the very breath of the
poem: in itself, already, a product of the imagination. It is in this way that
Arab poetry found again the deep sense of its true tradition: a tradition of
innovation and questioning.

date of the conquest of Bagdad by the turco-mongolian army.

When in Rome do as the Americans do.
The tabloids report Beatrice Foods is launching suit against all other Beatrices
who are all, it is alleged, and without any exceptions, heretofor and
forthwith, considered damaging to that incorporate reputation, and so what's
in a name ?
Sioux Falls is in an uproar. Rumours abound that Sue had a serious accident
but no one is quite sure which version to believe.
Beatrice is changing her name & Henry has gone into chicken ranching.
His primary rational is not monetary gain but the spiritual fact that
chickens are something that can be lass-sued. There is a loose connection in
all these facts on the fringes of near urban life.
Any ark in a storm. The sacred frisbee vanishes into a quantum well causing
a long line of flagelland physicists to pilgrimage seeking Sue.
With chicken feathers dyed respectable colours.
Clay feet came from original lumps of clay giving original sin a new meaning.
All people who are not silly putty by nature will be subject to being exchanged.

I find this post completely baffling.  I was talking about the Brooklyn
Dodgers, as I recall...

"only opposite of the word racist"??? ...**Huh?**

The Dodgers who kept the team from carrying out a racist "job action"
against Jackie Robinson were, I think, (for their time and place)
anti-racist guys...


Right?

Sorry, but:

 metonymicity:  Coy? Me? Tiny Tim?
metaphoricity:  I'm a poetry itch.

The first uses all of its letters to represent part of its potential in
the [metonymic?] figure of Tiny Tim; the second predicates itself as
prior to itself--an impulse toward its own creation [and thus violates
the tense of its verb]. A dead heat? [& how about *that* metaphor?!].

Actually, Don Wellman went into my question quite deeply.  I'm not sure if
his message was posted to the list or not, because I only got one copy,
directly from him and not the list.  Don, however, says he got his list
copy and that I can go ahead and post my reply to his post:

---------------------------------------------------

Don, I perceived in your post a whiff of sophistry and in re-reading mine a
blast of loose diction.


you wrote

No, I didn't mean for "anything" to refer to discourse -- but rather the
world which we mediate or construct (depending on your metaphor) indirectly
via discourse.

The metaphor I'm picturing is a giant web of likenesses and differences --
that's not original is it -- Saussure? Perception or apprehension may be
direct, but what the mind does immediately afterwards (and sometimes
before, in acts of prediction, anticipation and prejudice) is to place the
perception somewhere in that web in order to try to "understand"  Where did
you find the mechanistic notion of the relation between words and things?
I hope I don't think that way -- it sounds so rigid, not to mention
unfashionable.


>When I drink
>wine, I do not experience it by analogy.

No, but the first time you drank wine, you probably had to go through the
(maybe instantaneous) process of connecting drinkable liquids (water, grape
juice--similes) to the wine that was before you to ensure it was not in
fact gasoline or some other non-drinkable liquid.  In time you learned to
create distinctions about wines, Gallo being in big jugs and working class,
etc.; you learned that wine was a soPHISticated EuropEan thing to drink;
that white is for seafood

Yes, these are associations, maybe not analogies.  Or some are analogies
and some are distinctions and most are associations -- but they are all
mediations of experience.


When I read Nada's sentence, I
>hear a desire for immedicacy--that seems to float off her words and does

Do I feel a desire for immediacy? Maybe.  A kind of "cut the bullshit"
impatience with my mind.  But I don't feel some poignant heavy longing or
anything like that.  I am curious about this immediacy thing but I'm not
sure it's humanly possible --  although "enlightened" people claim to
perceive everything (that web) in a sudden flash of connectedness and
present-ness.  I also seem to remember a philosopher (who was it?  help me
here) talking about a state of mind called EPOCHE in which we experience
something, if only for a moment, without any preconceptions, we see a bird
and don't call it a BIRD or a SPARROW, we observe the movement, the
feathers, the shape of the head, the sharp little beak,but the brain
doesn't rush to file it in a nest of preconceptions and memories and
experiences and classifications in order to understand it.

I'm not sure what you meant about mental acrobatics but I suspect you may
be insulting me.  Doesn't understanding anything require mental acrobatics?
Even unwilled and unconscious? Or do we just grok by sudden immediate
grasping?

That is my

If the brick in the road gave you a feeling it would make you a lyrical poet.
If the thing in itself is a feeling rather than a brick in the road what
would we build our houses with?
(It's all right for impressions to be rationally indefensible.  I like that.)

Irony has a bunch of meanings.  One is pretended naivete (Socratic irony)
that intends to lure something out of an interlocutor.  Another is a
statement that actually means the opposite or something quite different
from what it literally states.

Which irony did you load my statement with?

When I analyze my motives, I find there was some of both kinds of irony there.

I didn't mean that kind of enlightenment, the age of reason kind.  I live

the *willies*.

the Age of Reason, the thing in itself, etc. None of what I

OK I concede that what I meant was sometimes "by association" and sometimes
"by analogy." (Sometimes by metonymy and sometimes by metaphor -- but
(almost?) never by itself -- "never ever jam today")

YES YES YES!  That was the *real* point of my post and not those

This sounds like another version of the web? -- you see I am trying really
hard here to understand what you're talking about by means of analogy.  All
this you're building is a structural metaphor too.

 in his essay "Medievalism."--near the end of the Cantos, he

This sounds a little like living on the San Andreas fault (another analogy,
sorry, I'm getting lost in all these models -- my plateaus are slippery --
oo).

OK, if metaphors blossom or thread than they are either

metaphor 1:  part of an interdependent garden or ecology of meanings
metaphor 2:  strings on a web (a sort of macrame world)

Roses don't exist objectively for you? (How) do they exist? Or what does

Did you intend face or facet?  Facet goes with your earlier metaphor but
it's faces that are maintained, or "saved".

Hmm, that's funny.  I would say that what's so eerie about deja vu
experiences is their immediacy or anyway their sudden demand for
recognition -- you think, "I know this, I know this sequence as a whole
already."

Don, your post is like a carousel of horned philosophers grabbing at
imitation seafood in the midnight. I mean that as a kind of steel rose in
the vortex.

DZ: The first time I drank wine, I got stupid and puked. The stupid
part, I think, derived from analogy to other sober moments of stupidity
which I'd experienced--directly and vicariously--before; the puking
represented an act of intelligence. As my oenological sophistication
matured, I generally ceased puking and a modicum of wit (lunatic at
first, admittedly, then gradually drier... sec!) displaced torrential
boorishness--at least in my own rather hazy memory. I attribute this
recapitulation of phylogeny to the kindness of the increasingly bright
and often alcoholic crowd who put up with me. In other words, I
developed not only a tolerance for the grape, but a respectful affinity
for it, by way of analogizing my behavior under its influence with that
of my peers. I like to drink champagne; how 'bout you?

This is very odd, and probably very misleading.

1). Arab culture became Islamic culture. That's it, pure and simple.
    Even its deviances occur very rigidly within an Islamic framework.
    I know of no exceptions to that fact.

2). Poetry within that socio-cultural contextual situatedness, subsequent
    to the writing of the Koran, believed to be by Mohammed, whom the Islamic
    believers refer to as a prophet, is strictly limited to rhyming poetry
    of a very specific kind. In fact the kind that is used by a suitor seeking
    marriage, and written by the suitor to a woman. As polite as such verse
    usually is, even nowadays, it is considered very baudy and "off colour"
at      the very best. The interesting fact is that, according to the rules, it
    MUST rhyme, though there are very specific and complicted limits as to
    content as well as the restriction to rhyming verse.

3). Mohammed, the reputed author of the Koran, was reputedly a poet, and along
    with other poets, is said to have been in contest. Such contests were
    traditional, at the black rock at Mecca, in pre-Islamic times. Since
    then such contests have ended. Only the Koran is recited there, as far
    as I know, and never any other poetry. The poetry contests ended when
    the Islamic era began. (The story of Mohammed reputedly having had the
    verses of the Koran dictated to him, in a cave, need not be repeated here.)

4). There is Sufi poetry, but Sufi poetry is quite a different matter. As I
    tend to understand that, the Sufi's claim exception as to methods, even
    though they have adopted Islamic beliefs to which their methods supposedly
    lead others who are reputedly unable to follow the more direct path
    prescribed by the Koran. So Sufi poetry has its unusual quirks and offers
    various fascinations and spiritual hooks. Not the only hooks in the
    tradition, but certainly hooks meant to urge conversion to belief in
    essentially the same ideas as espoused by the Arab mainstream.

5). Within Islamic culture, it appears, sociologically, that the arrangement
    is highly hierarchical and stratified. The desert Arabs are the highest
    level, then the other groups. Pakistanis tend to be regarded as among
    the lowest. The Persians as somewhere below the desert Arabs. Of course
    there is internal conflict, but nevertheless there does tend to be a
    spiritual class structure of sorts, even if loosely maintained. This has
    a lot to do with the factof language. The Koran is properly known only
    in its ancient Kufic Arabic form, not even in modern Arabic.

    The other groups rarely know modern Arabic, let alone ancient Arabic. In
fact many Arabs cannot read the Koran in its orignal form. Poetry, of
spurious kinds, though keeping loosely within the Islamic themes and
somewhat consistent with Islamic beliefs, tends to be more prevalent in
other cultures other than that of the desert Arabs. On the other hand, as
    in Iran, in the spirit of spiritual competitions, with the desert Arabs,
    which is a very important concept within Islamic tradition, there is
    tendency towards very rigid totalistic purging of such strains of
    poetics and more than a hard line urging towards purity where the only
    poetry is the Koran and certainly to them the only acceptable poetry.

    So, in fact, there is less and less, sanctioned poetry within Islamic
    culture, but more and more stress upon the Koran as essentially the
    last _proper_ instance of poetry within their culture. In fact there
    is an Islamic belief, often put into practice, that anything referring
    esplicitly to the Koran's contents that is not the Koran, particularly
    if it includes Arabic language, must be burned as an abomination.

So I really do have difficulty understanding what that article is about.
Sure isn't about anything on this planet.....

Listpersons who may recall the name "George Bowering" will now be able to
examine at length several shameful episodes purportedly from his life by
going to
     http://www.chbooks.com/onlinebooks/piccolo/title.html

There one can find the novel _Piccolo Mondo_ , online in all of its 25
chapters.This book, which concerns itself with campus life in 1961 in
Vancouver, was authored by GB together with wife Angela B and bosom-buddy
Mike Matthews. Because I was also at UBC then, and knew not enough to avoid
GB, I was a friend of Angela and Mike as well. Due no doubt to this
friendship, these 3 are circulating a rumor that I too had a hand in
writing this collocation of disgraceful episodes. If I did, so what? It was
only to help out an old buddy or 3. Back in 1961, I helped them out of
several bars a week. There are a few bugs in the text, but the fetish
object formerly known as "a book" will be available within weeks, bug-free.
When recoiling at the listed price of said object, remember that CAN$28 is
only about US$18 .

And keep in mind that Bowering Manor is mortgaged up the wazoo to cover
GB's gambling debts.

Shameful Promo over, dutifully yrs, db3.

Thanks Dan. I should have suspected phenomenology at play here. Husserl is getting
at what I meant by both the brick and the wine that I envoked. I guess I took to
wine more immediately than some.

Dear Nada, very thoughtful, thought provoking, and engaging reply. There
seem to be some misunderstandings on the mechanical/instrumental level.
I sent my post to the list and invoked your earlier post as well as some
others as I wove my thoughts--that is why I tangled your first meaning
of enlightenment with my reservations concerning rationalism.

I know I sent my post to the list because I received a copy of it when I
next downloaded from the list. I suggest that you post the message that
you sent me to the list now.

I understand what you mean by 'epoche' and wish very much that I knew
the source, but I don't. I also think that I understand what is
generally meant by "direct apprehension." Usually --it means direct
apprehension of the abstract--that cosmic rose or whatever. I see real
roses very well. I do not always see patterned cosmic forces. When I see
a brick in the road that speaks to me it is through color and
texture--not with a voice, not as a "a jar on a hill in Tennessee." It
might be a genetic quirk in my mental composition, but I tend to insist
on the material as though it already had a surplus of abstract/spiritual
meaning. I like Deleuze and Guattari, because there is a matter not only
of slipping, but also the pace and acceleration in the rate of flow. I
am opposing Pound (what I take to be the modern stance that "time is the
enemy") and situating perception in time. Deja vue is stunning because
it is a palpable fold in time.

"Don, I perceived in your message a whiff of sophistry and in re-reading

mine a blast of loose diction."

My earlier post was very sophistical wasn't it? You are right I confused
the motive to explain with the motive to taunt. I did not mean to
personalize my response in the least bit though. I did pick at your
loose diction precisely because of the doors that it opened in my mind
and was pretty loose in turn with my own diction.

Where did you find the mechanistic notion of the relation between words
and things?
I hope I don't think that way -- it sounds so rigid, not to mention
unfashionable.

My reference is to Bishop Pratt? to those philosophers in Gulliver's
Travels who carry packs of things with which to discourse--the thread
here is part of my challenge to the Enlightenment Era rationalism. By
contrast I took your "anything" to be an essentially empty marker
(that's Roland Barth's I think) and just rushed in ... I should have
thanked you?

the first time you drank wine, you probably had to go through the
(maybe instantaneous) process of connecting drinkable liquids (water,
grape
juice--similes) to the wine that was before you to ensure it was not in
fact gasoline or some other non-drinkable liquid.  In time you learned
to
create distinctions about wines, Gallo being in big jugs and working
class,
etc.; you learned that wine was a soPHISticated EuropEan thing to drink;

that white is for seafood

I am not one to contest the notion that even breathing is learned
behavior--but I do contest the notion that my pleasure in wine is
semantically coded. Although everything you imply here is probably true
in some sense; it is not true of "my pleasure" and if I become aware of
any of this knowledge (maybe by choosing an Entre deux mers for
mussels), it, it probably detracts from "my pleasure"--even the now
self-conscious knowledge that I have made a sophisticated choice of a
dry white to go with or cook the the mussels in--puts something like
reception at risk, not the pleasure of the wine itself--something, a
pleasure, I think I can relate to directly, even though my ego has now
gotten in the way ...

I'm not sure what you meant about mental acrobatics

what I meant was that I directly apprehended your desire to cut the
bullshit--even as I larded my own discourse with sophistical acrobatics.
I suppose I had hoped that some one would get a direct sense that I was
clowning--or did I desire to see my self caught in the web of my own
rope tricks and threads. Maybe there is no third term for me for the way
my mind works. I take directly, give back indirectly, suppressing the
common denominator. I am much more fascinated by ego issues than is
probably fashionable on this list. For me "feelings" are matters of
reception and of empathy and of insights when there is a matching of
desires. By "ego issues" I do not mean "egotism"--I generally see no
point in subtracting myself from where I am standing--that gets back to
the directness/indirectness thread. I am arguing for a direct
apprehension of where I am standing (or of how I pass through my local
environment) without elevating myself to some self above the self and
thereby directly perceiving the otherwise only indirectly perceptible
other. This is a negation of the Jungian notion of self/other
...individuation. probably an acrobatics of the soul that I called
"mental" above?

Irony has a bunch of meanings.  One is pretended naivete (Socratic
irony)
that intends to lure something out of an interlocutor.  Another is a
statement that actually means the opposite or something quite different
from what it literally states.

Which irony did you load my statement with?

Unfortunately I loaded your statement with Socratic irony. I received a
"D" in Brit lit ages ago for my failure to appreciate "irony."

With reference to what I wrote about Pound and Deleuze and Guattari, you
wrote:

This sounds a little like living on the San Andreas fault (another
analogy,
sorry, I'm getting lost in all these models -- my plateaus are slippery
--oo)

If you live there, you live there? That is why I put my emphasis
here--if not in my first post-- on the palpable rate of flow. If the
ground isn't sliding out from under your feet why worry? Be happy! It it
is scurry. Possibly not a very pragmatic response on my part, but I have
these sense that our cultural constructs conspire to adapt us to living
with fear, uncertainty, distraction ... My point: there is both a
mindscape and a physical terrain to adapt to. The easy answer is to
adapt to the physical environment. We need to talk with one another
about the anxiety that makes it difficult to do this (however produced,
however maintained, and used to keep us happy consumers). Are we
hurtling down an abyss or shrugging our shoulders? Why are we standing
still? I am from the east and I am imagining that you and I are talking
about the pros and cons of living on the San Andreas fault. I have not
experienced the trauma of an earthquake so I depend on you for that
information if you have it.

>His enlightenment becomes my fake simile?  ... I am getting flakey now,

>having reached the limits of my ability to maintain a faced of
coherence.

Did you intend face or facet?  Facet goes with your earlier metaphor but

it's faces that are maintained, or "saved".

I have puzzled myself over how to code this typos. I meant "face"--but
when I re read it, I wished I had developed a "face off" analogy--as in
hockey, my team against those with COHERENCE blazoned on their jerseys,
sounds like  bad Disney movie, now. In 1982, I edited an anthology of
post-modern poetry and poetics called "Coherence."

I wanted to conclude my first post by saying that even "indirection is a
form of direct thought" and I think you understood that. I was thinking
of William James who said that even a thunderclap does not interrupt the
the stream of thought"--it may change its direction though. I get lost
in my own channels so easily.

... concluding then on an appreciative and unresolved note.

Exactly.

Fact is that all kings were divine, as in divine kingship. People tended to
understand things much more literally than they do now. (Odd word,
literally, to use in that context as there was no question of literal as
hardly anyone could read and write until very recently.) Divine kingship
really was the divinity of the king. The king was 'od. Very odd, compared to
the people. He even dressed very 'od. He talked 'od. He behaved 'odly.

On a more serious note Frazer's _Golden Bough_ is sufficient as an
introduction to that subject, and offers a paradigm applicable to most, if
not all, ancient and not so ancient cultures. He covers the fusion of
traditions quite nicely, within European culture, and many of their various
manifestations.

So when a king impregnated a non noble woman, obviously she had become pregnant
by means of immaculate conception. That was nothing unusual in the ancient
world. (Now we are taking it too in a too literal manner and fail to see
this.) If she had become pregnant by means of someone of lower rank, her
husband would have had reason for complaint and terrible consequences would
have befallen her.
She would have become outcast at best, being sent away, or stoned to death
at worst. Since it was the lord, it is acceptable. We might easily imagine
some telling fibs about the lord paying them a visit. However, since kings
could have anything they chose to have, complaints were uncommon and the
women were forgiven by their husbands as they had no say in the matter
themselves and neither did their husbands. Neither could refuse to do the
lord's bidding. Their command was from the lord, and if anything issued from
the liaison then it was the work of the lord, and not of any man, making it
quite acceptable. Seems 'od but it was an epidemic situation, if a woman was
at all attractive enough to be noticed by the lord.

Such events were euphemistically, poetically in fact, referred to, and no
woman would ever dare say "the king came today and banged me up". That would
have been completely unheard of. Instead she was blessed and immaculate,
unstained in the eyes of her husband, and not in any way lacking in
fidelity. The latter was essential so that women whom those of high rank
found attractive and therefore took when the urge came to them, as a matter
of their own undisputed privilege, would not be spurned subsequently and so
that no social dissent and outcry against those privileged would be likely
to happen. Kings, princes, and sometimes other members of the nobility such
as dukes and barons commonly had such privileges. Even foreign lords, as
some allusions in the grimoires to such demons readily attest. (Ah, you
didn't know that either did you ? The grimoires on one level are mostly
veiled references, even catalogues, of foreign political powers and their
political relations. Some foreign lords were known for their prowess at
immaculate conceptions. After all, no man was there, only a demon prince and
there was issue from the womb nine months later. What could a husband do ?
Visiting nobles also had certain privileges shared with the local lord.)

What is interesting is that such a common occurrence, has come down to us
within a particular story, from ancient times, and been preserved as what is
often included within poetic literature.

So who was the lord ?  Herod is perhaps most likely. So we have a poem about
the lord having a woman named Mary, and the lord having second thoughts
about it later, as sometimes happened, because another potential heir might
upset some succession plans, or create dangerous rivalries upsetting the
established order.
Any child who was a son of the lord, an immaculate conception, could gather
a following simply by that fact, sharing in the divine kingship, and that
could prove highly dangerous.

Unless we claim parthanogenesis. Not so likely.

We live in the direct succession to Alexandria and Rome.

The ancient Egyption contribution, via ancient Greek culture, and Greek
culture to Roman, cannot be underemphasized.

As for the first coming last, it is something to win over the people. A
poetic phrase promising a future where the king will follow and the people lead.
Of course it has become politically true in terms of democracy, at least in
principle, if not always in fact.

Of course, a god was the first thing or being, according to most creation
myths, and therefore the god will be last ?  Perhaps saying only that
whatever everything came from it will return to. The uncarved block of
Taoism is the first and the last, from which all ventures forth and all
ultimately returns in an undending cyclical haiku of a breath in and a
breath out.

Of course "spiritual" (philosophical or religious) systems and how they are
understood are integral to poetics. It is impossible to do poetics without
wrestling with some such questions....in any tradition or across cultural lines.

The

recitation. The ability to remember, precisely, is highly prized and
rewarded within the culture. That has not changed even a little since
ancient times, but has in fact become more emphatic since the Koran was

DZ: True, though the original Koranic orality pretty quickly became
written and inviolable (emphatic) after the prophet's death. Adonis does
struggle with the paradox you mention in his final chapter--and not
altogether successfully (i.e., not without some equivocation). He does,
though, call for a freedom of thought which transcends mere stylistic
experiment, and concludes that "The essence of this is that modernity
should be a creative vision, or it will be no more than a fashion.
Fashion grows old from the moment it is born, while creativity is
ageless. Therefore not all modernity is creativity but creativity is
eternally modern" (101-102).
        Here, he seems to historicize the (changing, linear?) principle
of creativity as equivalent to the (unchanging, cyclic?) ideal of the
umma at the time of the prophet. As he says earlier, "...the modern Arab
poet lives in a state of 'double siege' imposed upon him by the culture
of dependency on the one hand, and the culture based on a foetal
relationship with the traditionalist past on the other" (81). What he
proposes may serve as a way out of this impasse for him, but many may
find that razor too sharp a path.

Aldon -- me too I hope you're wrong -- Adonis, to me, was not only a fine
poet & critic, but also something of a friend -- I haven't heard anything

Not such an incredible claim. Unhappily, though you may rather easily find some
"examples" of Abu Nuwas' poetry it will be mainly lousy translations -- better to
dig in deeper into Adonis' & other such writings (at least until we have or can
make worthwhile translations of those poems) as it is an understanding of the
cultural history of Arab poetics & history that make the point clearer. The claim
sounds "incredible" only if you think that modernity is somehow the exclusive
domain of euro-culture, i.e. something that happened first and only in 19C Europe
& then in Americ and that could not have happened somewhere else in a totally
different cultural situation a 1000 years ago.

Of course -- that is to say, my interest in Arab poetics connects in some ways
with my Nomad Manifesto — though there my focus is more on pre-islamic poetics,
i.e. those of the Arab nomad tribes, rather than on what Adonis is talking about
in this piece, which is an Arab urban modernism that flowered in the Abassid
period, and which he, I believe rightly, compares to a similar revolution in
poetcis happening in europena modernism in the 19C. So it is also true that much
of the Abassid poetics involved Sufi notions & practices, and that is indeed of
interest for my nomadic thinking.

I would tend to agree with you -- science is full of metaphor -- but isn't it
exactly when that fact goes unrecognized, i.e. when science & its worldview
constructs get taken as _literal_ and not metaphoric, that we get  a kind of
scientistic fundamentalist not that different from the kind of religious
fundamentalism Adonis is referring to?

O goodness. I mean--take quarks--whose name famously comes from Finnegans
Wake ("Three quarks for Mister Mark"), and whose different varieties are
called up, down, top, bottom, charm, and strange, and which are said to
have the qualities "color" and "flavor." (And now "Quark" is both a highly

metaphor is all over science.

Thanks Dan and Pierre for comments and more that leave me eagerly looking
forward to Adonis's book.

Dan's citation: "Language... is not a tool for communicating a detached
meaning. It is meaning itself because it is thought. Indeed, it precedes
thought and is succeeded by knowledge. This implies that the criterion of
meaning was contained in language itself, and was defined by the rules of
language" (82)  is invaluable, and I suspect Pierre's insta-translation
will be too. I've clipped it to read this weekend.

Thanks!

Tom

I *don't* want to discuss this here, it is an imposition on a list for whom
this will *not* be interesting, and anyway it's too divisive and positions
are too set for a listserv to be a platform for making any progress on this
kind of a subject.

Yet, I can't get myself to let this go by:

"I meant that Xtianity is a Biblical religion and the core of it, the
spiritual core of it, is Hebraic.  - Henry G."

To which my answer is simple: bullshit. The spiritual core of Christianity
is Roman pagan religion. You think the trinity-mystery is a "Hebraic" idea?
No thanks. Btw, the term "Hebraic" is a hegemonic insult however
unconsciously placed.

Just as Rome used Greek ideas and any other ideas (immensely successfully!)
as a means to ideological/cultural domination, so it turned to Jewish ideas
and treated them similarly. In Xtianity, Judaism and scripture are
swallowed. That's not being "core."

The very idea of "a Biblical religion" illustrates the point. That there is
a single "Bible" consisting of the Gospel (truth) and the "Old Testament"
is a "fact" only within a dominant, imperial, "religious" empire (the term
"religion" is a Roman term folks -- Jews do not have "a religion").

I will speak no more on this subject on this list. Feel free to backchannel
if absolutely necessary.

I'm still curious about the notion that some subjects generate metaphor
and others supply it.  Also about the possibility of the trucks of
metaphor moving meaning between sites.  Someone told me yesterday that
Americans move on average about 17 times per lifetime.  I could be in
haiku-daze. Do metaphors generate movement in much the same way that Ryder
trucks connect the differences between Lafayette, Indiana, say, and
Lubbock, Texas.  So it all comes down to the current state of the road.

Maybe this idea of a divide between "artistic metaphorical thinking" and
scientific (or direct, or realistic, or factual) non- or anti-metaphorical
thinking -

maybe this IDEA of art vs. science - is really a METAPHOR -

for a deeper divide (in our minds & in our culture) between forces and
impulses TOWARD art and AWAY from art.  A kind of replay of the Byzantine
battle between iconophiliacs and iconoclasts.  Played out very directly
in the federal de-funding of arts since the 80s.  That art is a
charismatic-absorptive-mirroring-illusory-gratifying phenomenon which
evokes mixed feelings always - a dangerous, mongrel, illegitimate thing -
a useless thing -

so that poets who want to play this out in terms of metaphor's illusory
idealistic traditionalist aestheticism, in favor of factuality's
direct, honest, hardhitting political treatment of the thing, should
maybe be aware of the double-edged nature of all this - "factism"
becomes politically-correct "fascism" just as quickly as solipsissy
aesthoidism does...

Now this is getting fun.  I'm not going to take recourse to "history", which
on the list here would get boring & overlong.  I'd rather respond with my
own "illegitimate" story.  I was brought up in the Episcopalian church.
Singing the hymns, the whole bit.  Lost interest in my teens.  Regained
interest in late teens, when I read the "2 testaments" through, front to
back.  You can toss the "bullshit" if you want to, Tom, but you wrong.
As the elevator man said, "The Bible is my main book" - & that goes
for the whole religion.

If you want to make accusations of "borrowing" you could start with
the Hebrews - they took it all from Egypt & Mesopotamia & made a very new
blend.

Yes, Christianity took the Hebrew Scriptures & twisted them into a shape
full of menace, eventually, for the Jews themselves. This is the sick
tragedy of it all and the reality that demands awareness, criticism,
and change on the part of churches.  But the same scriptures are
the source of what is good about Christianity, too - the word, the
demand for charity and justice, the message.

Metaphors generate roads (that's my view). For I.A. Richards metaphors are
"vehicles"--that is Ryder Trucks. The contents of the truck is its tenor or
meaning.

If the vehicle stands in for the tenor it is really a synecdoche isn't it?
(container for thing contained).

In Richard's way of putting it, meaning is relatively stable. One of the
things we have been trying to do on this list is destabilize all three
elemenrs and put them in motion: the truck, the contents of the truck, and the
road.

Metaphors deflect or impart motion (desiring in put)--but there is no
guarantee that the roads or threads generated by a metaphor will connect
Lafeyette with Lubbock. They might set up such a swaying in the truck that it
tips over outside of Tulsa; the desires that the truck was carrying heating
the ozone layer as they escape, and the sheell of the truck being appropriate
for use as a taco stand.

Before which it had been the name of en excellent experimental science

I'm glad Pierre and Henry understood what I meant rather than what I wrote
(thank you). Instead of having a generous, outside perspective on the whole of
science, 'specially wrt to its glorious heyday before hyperspecialization, when
science worked itself nicely into (co-existed with) a pre-existing aesthetic of
the imagination, the intent of my question was to probe for a way out from the
inside of this unquestionable hegemony of technology, and the idea of science
just "being there," intuited rather like history is now. This is really also an
economic thing now ("don't take this personally, this is about business").
Pierre answered succinctly when he replied, "science is full of metaphor -- but
isn't it exactly when that fact goes unrecognized, i.e. when science & its
worldview constructs get taken as _literal_ and not metaphoric, that we get a
kind of scientistic fundamentalist not that different from the kind of
religious fundamentalism Adonis is referring to?" I agree with Henry too. This
is not merely an issue: the notion of such a dichotomy is itself metaphor and
the implications are there for hegemony in the extremes.

Gwyn's mention of "three quarks for Muster Mark" illustrates the liberal
mindedness of scientists in the 60's and 70's to use such whimsical naming
conventions (W/albeit western sources). Not to say that doesn't happen now, but
there is an overall fear of being misunderstood, or cryptic in today's
marketing science (Oedipal) mentality so perhaps that explains why they still
use the SAME names. I think that the quark phrase comes from Lear or Carroll
rather than Finnegan's Wake doesn't it?

re : http://www.chbooks.com/onlinebooks/piccolo/title.html


George Borrowing has gone too far this time. I dont like taking up list
space for a personal matter, but since he has gone public, I must respond
here. For a lifetime, since we played the national sport, hookey, together
as boys in Oliver, B.C., I have bailed him out of innumerable scrapes--and
this is the recompense I get : "vapid maunderings," "bad jokes."  All I did
was tighten a linguistic screw or two in a work that is largely his alone
(with a little help from his two other cohorts). You know, corrected his
spelling, changed each archaic "a lot" to "alot," made sure his participles
weren't dangling, and helped him with the Future Vague and Imperfect
(always his achille's heel). Back of all this lies the poor self-image he
suffers from. This is why he is bad-mouthing a really neat piece of writing
and projecting the flaws that he imagines, onto others--one other, namely
me. (I notice he says nothing of the excellent passages by his other
friend, Matthews, or by Angela, his own wife!)

George Burrowing, however, cannot escape so easily this time. Go to the
htttp above & you'll find his name boldly inscribed on the Title Page. More
telling, you'll find his prose-style throughout, easily identifiable to
players & lurkers of this List alike. And who can doubt that the escapades
within could only have happened to a youthful Beering? (Since they continue
to happen to an aging Baring?)

I trust this will be the last time I have to trouble the List with
rebuttals in this case. Let GB know that the age of duelling isnt over till
I say so. As for Oregon, it has already been Californicated, too late for
BC to Vanca-hoover it up.  Outraged in Virtuality, db3.

That reminds me of a quote that I particularly like, though it is
a very dark bit of prose about poetics:


                   "In the end the artificial intelligentsia will
                    win: people will have been reduced to machines -
                    as Winston Smith was reduced to loving Big Brother -
                    and there will be only one understanding of
                    King Lear."

                    from "1984: A Collection of Essays"
                    published in 1984


                    the author of the quote is a contributor to that
                    intresting little volume, to which I have forgotten

Of course, as a footnote, I think Adonis would see one interpretation of the
Koran as the ultimate evolution of Arab poetics, and quite acceptable as
the outcome of the creative process they believe manifests conceptually
and currently in gestation, if not maturing towards an Islamic totalism.
I would think they too have achieved A.I. and are able to use the technology.
In fact I am _intuitively_ absolutely certain that they have it.

Reminds me a little of the Soviet "megaloplasm", which was also a kind of
A.I. loop machine technology resembling the many other kinds of what are
sometimes loosely called "techno shamanism".

On behalf of my beloved brother Spanky, who is unfortunately momentarily

Mr. - db3[?] - for alerting us to this possible electronical allusion
[fictional, I hope] to his "dead ringer" experience.  In the Masonic
Temple of Boom, OR, when the last G became the first G and the borrower
burrowed through a wormhole and emerged - drug-free - in Vancougar, BP
[Black Panther, Canalda]. We'll be sure to look it up, together.

If Dante & Virgil traveled that path, why, so can I.  God pointed the way.
But did he get it all backwards - that remains the question, with a capital Q.
I'm sure Beatrice knows.

Sorry, I have to say something.  Actually there are quite a few
references in Jewish scriptures about the Trinity.  For example, when God
says "let's make man in my image,"  the Hebrew word actually means "our
image" (plural).  Unfortunately things such as this are often lost in
translation.  Its always good to research such things when studying
religious scriptures.

With all due respect to Tom and others here (since this was noty directed at me
per se), this is just unnecesary. But let's not throw the baby out with the
bath water here by making statements such as, "The spiritual core of Xtianity
is Roman Pagan religion." First because it just ain't true and ignores a wealth
of OT prophecy, and hey, what about the reformation there. This ends up
sounding like the most reductionalizing demagoguery, which isn't Tom M. (in
light of his vasty knowledge in the area of Hebrew studies). Not to
essentialize mine or anyone elses's beliefs here over yrs (Tom) either: you
stay on yr trajectory and I'll stay on mine.

Interesting. It's many years since I've had a tanah (that's hebrew for
bible for you honkies) in the house, but I don't remember that plural.
Backchannel (or front-channel) me a transliteration if you can't supply it
in hebrew alphabet?
By the by, my King James, courtesy of the Gideons and Best Western, does
have the plural, but I always assumed that that was Lancelot Andrews' idea
of proper protocol.
I'd love to see the other quite a few references, or at least citations so
that I can look them up. It's no secret that there are lots of polytheistic
survivals in the Old Testament, although these tend to diminish through
time, and Genesis I is pretty late, and probably of priestly origin. All
the more reason for my curiosity.
If you have a Masoretic translation around it would be nice to know how the
rabbis translate the phrase as well.

Mark P:
I believe it's fine to use the word anti-racist.  I really asked a very simple
question.  What is the opposite of the word racist (if you don't use the anti-
prefix or the alpha privative)?  And more generally, I guess, what percentage
of english words have "viable" opposites?  And then do you trust words that
don't have "viable" opposites?  Sorry, those last questions are kind of kevin
spacey.  But the first one is simple.

This i take issue with tho.  I don't think even the umpires understand this
rule (eg it can be invoked in the outfield.  eg it can be NOT invoked when an
infielder catches a fly with runners on 1 & 2 or bags loaded with less than 2
outs if the ball is deemed to be not enough of a :pop:  a line drive is an
easy example of this.  but in general, how do you know what's a pop & what's
not?)

I find this post completely baffling.  I was talking about the Brooklyn

"only opposite of the word racist"??? ...**Huh?**

The Dodgers who kept the team from carrying out a racist "job action"

anti-racist guys...

Fellow Listees:

Some of these are better than others, but the best really will make you
smile, so I send them forward as harbingers of spring.

I also highly recommend an essay in the current issue of _Harper's_ (what IS
that apostrophe doing there? Harper's WHAT?) by Laura Kipnis, which is
advertised as a justification of adultery but turns out to be more than
that: an transference (uh oh) of the LANGUAGE of private "scandalous"
behavior into public relevance -- an advance beyond the by now lame retort
"I don't care what he does privately as long as he's doing a good job
publicly" -- when actually the private and public have always had intimate
and scurrilous relations.

I note, happily, the baseball chatter starting to increase . . . but will
myself be watching the visual analog of Duncan McNaughton's _Valparaiso_ in
a few hours -- think of it: didn't Kansas lose early because granting Irby
tenure AND winning an NCAA championship would just be too much in one month?

Well, if you go to the http above you will see what I and any other fool
can see. There are 4 photos of the purported four authors. There is a photo
in b+w (whereas the other three are coloured) of "George Bowering." An
obviouys ruse on Bromige's part. No one looks that dumb, certainly not I.
He got some picture out of the Weekly World News and used photo shop on it
or something and came up with this dummy "author." I am not denying that
Brownwich may have collaborated with the other 2 authors, though I rather
suspect that they are phantasms, too.

But the point is that among the maunderings and really, trust me, bad
jokes, there is some good writing, and I take that to be Bromige at his
best (as he was in the book "The Gathering." He should not be so shy as to
disown those fine passages (one of 21 words on page 212, for example, and I
think there was another one somewhere in there.


More important: I would like to take this opportunity to announce that
Broadwinch never once got me out of trouble. He once saved me from Fiona
Dampington, but I never said I wanted to be rescued in that instance. But
he had the Jaguar and I had no car at all in those days.

Huge recommendations for the recently-published (but awfully expensive)
_Schocken Bible, Vol. 1, The Five Books of Moses._ translated with intro,
commentaries and notes by Everett Fox.

The goal is to get as close to the feeling, texture, structure of the
Hebrew as possible. It's fabulous.


"Let us make humankind in our image"

As you may imagine, in the many many volumes of commentary on this verse it
has always seemed a problem. One of my favorite midrashim on the subject
pictures Moses on Mt. Sinai, writing the scripture at God's dictation. He
has to write the work of each day of creation. When he comes to our verse,
he cries: "Sovereign of the universe, why do you supply an excuse to
heretics?" "Write," He replied. "Whoever wishes to err may err."

*A lot* of Judaism is in those few words.

There are two creation stories in Genesis -- in the first "Let us make
humankind in our image." In the second "and YHWH, God, formed the human, of
dust from the soil, he blew into his nostrils the breath of life and the
human became a living being.

human is "adam" dust is "adama" -- "and the dust became a living being."

Then it is the role of the human to span that gap, between "in our image"
and the dust of which she was formed. Never to lose both or, as we say in
my industry, "the two ends of the cable are in the same place."

One of the chasidim used to say "here are two truths to keep in your
pockets and use as required: 'for my sake was the world created' and 'I am
dust.'"

On Saturday the 14th of March the second Cork Conference for New and
Experimental Poetry organised by Alex Davis and Matthew Gedden was held.

First on was Trevor Joyce whose latest works, _Syzygy_ and _Hellbox_ were
launched at the conf.  In his introduction to the poem _Chimaera_, he
mentioned that formally it is based on the renga and combines texts by
Richard Lovelace, Aloysius Bertrand and the author and later interpolaters
of the Lieh Tzu.  (In a hostile review in Ireland, the poem was slated as
being too heavily influenced by Paul Muldoon, though not a word of it is
Trevor's own.  The briefest glance at the notes in the book _Stone Floods_,
which was the subject of the "review" would have revealed this.)  The Earth
due to be struck by an asteroid on 26th October 2028, Archbishop Ussher's
dating of creation to 10 am Thursday the 26th of October 6006 bc, and TJ's
own birthday being the 26th of October, the poem is justifiably full of
endings and beginnings.  Also, look up chimaera in a biology dictionary.

Ceres and Bacchus bid good night
sharp frosty fingers all your flowers have topped
and what scythes spared winds shave off quite

a moth bred out of moonlight I disturbed
from the dark folds where it lay hid

     a naked thing that seems no man may cheat
     and love like any jack
     another dressed may prove a beast

that creature fluttered free but voided in my lap
a maggot with a human head monstrous misshapen

such whose white satin upper coat of skin
cut upon velvet rich incarnadin
has yet a body and of flesh within

     whereas anything with six foot of skeleton
     with hands that grip with scalp of hair
     front teetch concealed inside a face
     and which leans forward as it runs
     is called a man with us

the joys of earth and air and thine entire
that with thy feet and wings dost hop and fly

  the sky unrolled its folds of purple and blue to the winds
  and later from these steps I saw on the horizon
  a village torched by soldiers blaze like a comet in the sky

then ah the sickle golden ears are cropped
dropping December shall come weeping in

     the blood of horses become jack o lantern
     the blood of ment become will o the wisp
     kites become sparrow hawks and those hawks cuckoos

  when the sun opened its golden lashes on the chaos of worlds
  and the earth was adrift with its cargo of ashes and bones
  my terrified soul then fled through the grey web of halflight
  but that spawn hung on in this shrill rush
  and spun himself into the full of its white mane

     cuckoos in due course again turn raptor
     swallows become oysters seashells hatch geese

poor verdant fool and now green ice thy joys
large and as lasting as they perch of grass
bid us lay in gainst winter rain and poise

     apes grown of sheep fish that are rotten fruit
     flies born of roe such transformations are

  souls of the dead like mountain oaks uprooted by demons
  souls of the dead like meadow flowers gathered by angels
  sun sky earth man all had begun all gone

I cannot tell who loves the skeleton
of a poor marmoset naught but bone bone

Subject:      Re: Stein quote - where?

I was reading along in a back issue of West Coast Line, and came
across an article by Doug Barbour on Roy Kiyooka.  Doug cites an
epigraph from Stein used by Kiyooka.  Here's the Stein passage:

"The business of art is to live in the complete actual present, that
is the complete actual present, and to completely express that
complete actual present."

Neither Doug nor I have been able to track down the precise source
for this Stein-quote, though we suspect it may be in the Lectures
(I've looked & can't find it) or Composition as Explanation (I've
looked & can't find it).

Anyone able to help out & locate where Kiyooka gets the Stein passage?
Kiyooka uses the passage in _transcanada letters_ but does not give a
source for the quote.

If anybody has anything to suggest as far as poetry (readings, bookstores,
books in English to read before I go, sites, etc.) in Hong Kong, Macau, or
Guangdong (sp?) province, I would like to listen.

I will be there for six days and am not going further into China.

A former employer who spoke Mandarin mentioned to me that there were two
distinct styles of poetry she was familiar with, a very formal one that her
mother used to write poems, and a more informal, modern style.  In Cantonese
as well?  Any difference in the poetry since the pronunciation is different?
Help?

so i will use my posting space today to deal--with merciless brevity--with
Bowering's latest, concerning evidence to be viewed at

           http://www.chbooks.com/onlinebooks/piccolo/title.html

--Just how reliable the Klaxon of Kerrisdale may be, can be illustrated by
his comments re the "authors' pics" to be seen at the beginning of _Piccolo
Mondo_ . *His* (quel egotist!) is not the only B+W pic : mine,too, is B+W.
But unlike the others, I do not get to have that small rectangle all to my
own body. If you look closely, you will see that the arm (with fist
attached) that props up my chin, is at an impossible angle. This is because
it is actually Bowering's right arm, not my left. This may be verified by
turning to p. 40 of Gale Research's _Contemporary Authors Autobiography
Series_, vol. 26, where the entire snapshot is reproduced.

I was able to check the online novel properly for the first time yesterday
by going to a computer superior to my own. It's a very nice design job, as
one has come to expect from Coach House. And let me say that Bowering's
best writing is in this novel. Didnt know the boy had it in him. He is also
an accomplished lit-mimic; there are passages in there I am told "sound
like" me. However, a Jaguar was never one of my attributes. George has me
confused with Liam Chutney, scholar of Nineties Decadence, who gave a
snockered GB a lift one night and offered to satisfy his curiosity
concerning Des Esseintes & the Philistines. Took them a long time to get
home.

With the wish that this posting contain something of value, I'll add that
I'm writing while listening to a great, weekly radio show available to all
in the Bay Area who can receive 94.1 FM, KPFA public radio. It's "The
Johnny Otis Show," 3 R n B packed hours from 9 till noon each Saturday,
with commentary by Mr. Otis hisself as he spins a notable succession of
vinyl from his extensive collection. The hour from 10-11 he reserves for
archive notes--he plays recordings he was involved in as performer &/or
producer, and remarks on what now strike him as their strong or weak
points, tells how they came to be made, and the like. Sometimes there's
live music--the other week, there was a Klezmer trio, a string quartet from
a local symphony, and a blues group--and spontaneous R+B prosody from the
small crowd gathered there at the Powerhouse Brewing Co in Sebastopol. For
those Listfellows who follow poetry into its musical adventure, and for
historians of the blues, this is a "mustn't miss" event. I'm goin' down
there soon as i sign off. See ya there?  db3

Hi--

The Stein quote comes from "Plays," from LECTURES in AMERICA.

I don't have the page number--I found the quote cited in a wonderful book
by Wendy Steiner entitled EXACT RESEMBLANCE to EXACT RESEMBLANCE (Yale:
Yale U Press, 1978). If you can't find the page number in "Plays," you
will be able to find it in Steiner.

And thanks for subscribing to Explosive! I just got your sub today--

This is Kevin Killian--recommending a new book you can order through the
mail. Black Star Series announces the publication of SWARM,  a book of
stories by Camille Roy.

The book design (by Jay Schwartz) utilizes color xerography, letter press,
and offset to striking effect: SWARM bears resemblance to a lesbian rug.

Here is Susan Smith Nash (in WITZ) on Camille Roy's previous book, "The
Rosy Medallions":  "This is the language of the socially-constructed (or
deconstructed) self bared naked so that you're forced to see your own
violences... If Henry Miller were a smart, funny lesbian and he were
rewriting The Rosy Crucifixion, this is what might result. Brilliant
insights into the savage dynamics of love."

SWARM is available from Small Press Distribution (800.869.7553), or by
mail, for ten dollars ($10) inclusive of shipping, handling, and tax, from

Remember, when you order this book from Black Star Series, make checks
payable to Megan Adams.  I would say, get many copies, you can give them
out as graduation presents too, or Mother's Day also.

Thanks everyone (but you'll thank me)--!

Trevor Joyce was followed by Michael Smith who read mainly new work which
included some remarkably successful poems written for children.  He also
read some of his translations of Machado and Lorca.  Unfortunately I do not
have any of the texts to hand.  Here is a poem from Michael's collection:
_Lost Genealogies_.

Next on was Geoffrey Squires, who read two long poems, both of which were in

No depth here but recession of surfaces
rock behind rock and behind that the road
and then rocks again, white, placed
one in front of the other, irregularly,
all shimmering

Gullies and folds, the basins
formed by the rocks, and the earth between
where it collects, light following
falling into the hollows, bending
over surfaces, a confusion
of ways down

The heat brings with it a silence
which is not the silence of night or of snow
but a heaviness and troubled vision
with stones, metal, buildings, all shimmering

Haze over everything, making everything unclear
as the heat rises, confusing
even the points of the buildings, the sharp features
the definiteness that they have

Warm evening, luminous calm
somewhere a bay is filled
soft tic of birds in the night air
rock behing rock and the path between
boulders gleaming white in the dark
in the distance the small eye of the house

Rocks in the darkness, shapes
sensed rather than seen, inert like animals
asleep in the middle of a field or by the road
which one moves among with care, picking a way home
across the dark grass

Small fires in the near hills and sound of the sea
beating down in the hollow of the bay
no sense of arrival but of echo only
reverberation in the darkness, footsteps
between silences, a dog barking in space

And the rocks still warm still shimmering
in the dark, after the day's burning
like the memory of another world
which they have crossed from somehow
like a memory of the physical

they are cool now in the moonlight
which picks them out on the hillside
like smooth, sleeping animals
hump-backed white forms
half-buried in the earth
and yet because of the moonlight
seemingly disembodied and removed
and quite unearthly

In some instances it does look like some scientists are being kept busy
reinventing the wheel over and over again, and describing how they did it.

This happens in part, because most scientists do not have any idea what is
already on the shelf and will not trickle down from beyond top secret, and
so they continue to work on what is at best obsolete and at worst a red
herring that will never amount to anything. They also do not have any idea
what others are doing. That is partly in the spirit of scientific
competition. It happens in part because of constraints of extreme secrecy,
the necessitating of much dissemination of disinformation to keep others off
the scent, and the quest for the ever so holy grant money grail. Corporate
competition nowadays is sometimes as fierce and as jealously guarded as is
military progress, and in fact the two can be closely linked.

Hyperspecialization is also the indicator of extreme secrecy. Each has their
tin part to work on, and does not know what it is for, or how it is to
function along with the other parts. Someone else will know how two parts go
together, but not how they are derived, or what the third is to be used for.
Only the very few and very elite know how anything goes together and see the
big picture. Of course a large portion of such instances of
hyperspecialization amount to nothing, but a few are the real thing, out
there in the stirred around in the vast soup of everything scientific. There
are inevitably many conflicting metaphors.

Anyway, what does the average post-graduate student, or professor, really
know about what exists and will not be available to the "scientific
community", let alone the "general public" or "consumer public", for at
least 50 years, if ever ?  Not much. To the average person science is and
can only be "edutainment". It is not much different from a vaudeville
routine, though more mentally challenging, and that is what attracts some to
that kind of entertainment.
Even to many scientists the uncharted brave new frontiers, where no
scientist has gone before, such as they dream of, is perhaps at best a vague
rumour. Fifty years is the estimate trickle down time for some of the most
advanced inventions and real breakthroughs. I doubt this has changed since
the Cold War ended. There are more covert attempts to gain control of such
advances for nefarious and alien purposes, including those attempts by
competing ideologies, than ever. So the metaphors of science as knowable by
everyman cannot possibly present a reasonable map of that darkest of dark
arts. True science remains occulted. What then do we have in terms of the
mantras and rituals that anyone might know something of, outside of its
highest priesthood ?  A little less than the neophytes beginning their
initiation into obfuscation and maintaining the veil of darkness.

In many senses a lot of science becomes a fiction concerning the world, and
deals only with how the world was known, or believed to be. The study of
literature could include the study of scientific literature, as a branch of
the study of popular fiction. It would, I think, be appropriate. The only
reason that it would defy most scholars within the area of literature is
their lack of knowledge of the scientific language of mythematics.
(Mythematics, as I prefer to call it, is a language I have not mastered
either, so I have every sympathy for anyone attempting to translate it into
common English. The claim is that it describes how the world is and predicts
how it will be. I think that claim is a little too bold sometimes, and that
in fact mathematics is the weaving of a mythic vision of how the scientist
somewtimes imagines how the world was, how it is likely to be and how it
shall evolve into the future. The myth, as do all myths, has its uses. Myths
have always been valuable and the mathematical myth of the world proves its
usefulness, in ways at least equal to the usefulness of descriptive prose
and metaphors in English.)

As for the devices, those doing the inventing, as did Thomas Edison, do not
care in the least as to what scientists said before it, or what they say
about it. The scientists can protest the invention, and declare it violates
paradigms, principles, even laws, but the inventor who engineers it will
simply point to it and tell them to watch it do what it has been invented to
do. The device works, and so what if it defies every known law and principle
that science has ever posited. Then the scientists can attempt to explain it
after the fact of its invention. Even in the most ordinary situations, where
secrecy is not the matter of concern, engineers and designers ultiamtely do
not care at all about science, but rather they care about whether something
works, and is pragmatically useful, rather than whether it can be explained
mythematically or in scientific metaphor.

Technical progress does not depend on science. Science more often depends on
progress for its cues, and attempts to catch up, by revising its paradigms,
principles and laws, such that they remain more consistent with new invention.

>Pierre answered succinctly when he replied, "science is full of metaphor -- but

>religious fundamentalism Adonis is referring to?"

There are fashions in science also. Fads, in fact, that come into and go out
of vogue. That, contrary, to Adonis, is a _good_ thing, simply because it
tends to thwart some of the dogmatism that would otherwise hold sway over
it. There is less tendency to declare absolutes, and more tendency to find
useful metaphors.
In that sense it is cliques, cults, and gamesmanship. It is the glass bead
game, in effect, and it can do that as a purely historical entity in a
mythic world that it constructs and modifies.

This is a very double-edged little story. Moses sets himself up this time.
By playing the cautious scholar, narrows God's own capacious sense of
human-divinity.  God, generously, plays along with Moses.  As long as he
writes it down.  "Write it, Moses.  Whoever wishes to err may err - including
you."

This I find fascinating.  Mandelstam's Voronezh poems
are all about soil, black earth.
Clay - American Bottomland - that's where the epics are.
Time flowers on the lips of whispered clay.
"costly clay"

I raise this greenness to my lips,
This sticky promise of leaves,
This breach-of-promise earth:
Mother of maples, of oaks, of snowdrops.

See how I'm dazzled, exalted,
Obedient to the lowliest root.

The phrase was purely prophetic. Remarkable isn't it ?

Of course, the process theologians claim, along with some others not of
their particular cult, that the process of creation, including evolution, is
on going.
So the prophetic statement becomes included within that larger rubric.

Strange that we do not get any accounts of the alien spaceship being in any
way involved until we get to Ezekiel and the O.T. apocryhpa and
pseudepigrapha. There we have some quite startling Barney and Betty Hill
type stuff.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Since the poetics list has become so religious of late, I thought I would
include my little piece of skull duggery, first published in 1995, and entitled
"The Morphealist Manifesto". Of course I have advised the OED of the coining
of the much needed words "morphealist", "morphealism" and "morpheality".
"Morpheal" seems to have been in some prior use, even if not included in the
edition I have at hand. Here it is...

The  MORPHEALIST  MANIFESTO

We, Morphealists, believe in Change.  We, Morphealists, believe in nothing
else, as being absolute, other than Change.We, Morphealists, believe that
everything Changes. We believe that everything that existed, in what is
commonly referred to as "the past", that exists in what is commonly referred
to as "the present", or that could exist, in what is commonly referred to as
"the future", is subject to Change. In fact, so is what is past, present and
future, subject to Change. We believe that anything, that is either
imaginable or unimaginable, has  existed, or could exist, somewhere in the
absolute of all of space and all of  time.

We believe that the limits of the human imagination are also completely
subject to Change. We believe that what was, what is, and what shall be
imagined, in its distinction to what is now considered real, is subject to
change. We believe in the power of Change as being the last and only
remaining genuinely supernatural power. The power of Change remains
supernatural, because Change and only Change transcends all previously
existing, now existing, and future existing, actual and potential, natures
and powers, as their only constant. There are no other,real, constants in
Nature or in Science. All other apparent constants are subject to Change.
We believe that the effective processes, that existed, exist, or that shall
exist, are all subject to Change.

Causalities, all causal relations themselves,  are potentially subject to
Change. The fact that a particular observable cause gives rise to a
particular observable effect, and that that is commonly believed to be
predictably thus, is not necessarily thus in the past or in the future. It
was only thus at that moment of the observation and prediction. That
apparent thusness, no matter how many times the same is observed or how
carefully and closely it is scrutinized and measured, is subject to Change.
This is not negated by any fact of a continuous series of similar or
identical causal relations, having been apparently observed, between any
particular kind of presumed cause and any particular presumed kind of
effect, nor by how many times that same was observed. The only certainty in
causality is Change.

Change is not  a theoretical principle, or an idea, or an existent, or an
energetic force, and yet there is nothing whatever, that ever existed, that
exists, or is yet to exist, that is not subject to Change, and which does
not exhibit the effects of Change. Change is everywhere, and in everything,
and yet change is not any particular thing, or any particular principle. It
is the most fundamental characteristic of everywhere and everything. In fact
there is no thought, and there are no ideas, without Change. The very
intention of keeping an idea in mind, as it has arisen there, itself
involves Change. Any mental activity involves Changes. The  mind is
essentially Change. Minds constantly Change.

We believe that everything that once existed, and everything that does not
now exist, is subject to the power of Change, such that that shall
somewhere, someday, exist again. In fact we believe that, subject to the
power of Change, that which did not ever exist and that which appeared to
have passed from existence, might subsequently have existed, or not ever
have not existed. We believe then, that neither the logical proposition that
it did not exist, nor the logical proposition that it never did not exist,
is falsified. This is a radical departure from all previous beliefs and
thinking.  Similarly, we believe, with equal resolve, that, subject to the
power of Change, what exists and was known, with absolute certainty, to have
existed, might henceforth not exist and then be known, with absolute
certainty, as never having existed. We believe then, that neither the
logical proposition, it existed, nor the logical proposition, it never
existed, is falsified. This is another radical departure from all previous
thinking. We believe that Change is the fundamental paradox, and that all
paradoxes of
time and space are ultimately resolvable to that fundamental paradox. We
believe that Change is absolute and that all changing is itself subject
to Change. We believe that the rate of change might be stopped, accelerated,
or decreased, in any instance of anything changing, by means of Change. The
apparent limitations as to effecting this, whether they are limitations as
to thought or technology, are subject to Change. Ultimately even the means
of effecting such Changes could themselves be effected by Change and could
be themselves Changed. Morphealism is the belief in the effecting of changes.

The advance forces of the Morphealist movement are the artists.  Morphealism
is the successor of Surrealism. Where Surrealism dealt with the idea and its
transmutations and permutations of its possibilities, Morphealism deals with
the manifestation into reality of the Surrealist Ideas.  The Surrealists
were the early prophets of Morphealism. Their domain was the production of
icons and symbols, within a language that pertains to the transformations
of the mind as its thoughts. This was the first realization of the world as
being a Morpheality.

We Morphealists recognize the fact that the mind is a mirror of the external
world. Thoughts are the mirror in which the world reflects. The nature of
the mind's processes reflect the nature of the world as manifestations of
the very same Morpheality. We Morphealists recognize that the mind and its
thoughts, as it was, is, and shall be, is subject to being Changed as a part
of the world as Morpheality. The stuff that the world is made of, its matter
and energies, its quanta, are the stuff that Morpheality is comprised of.
Morphealism in the arts is the forerunner of Morphealism in those realities
that go beyond the arts. The arts provide the experimental basis for the
implementation of the techniques of Morphealism to the whole of the world as
Morpheality. Whereas Surrealism was a new school, a new style, a new genre,
of art and within the arts, we Morphealists announce the end of all schools,
styles, and genres of art. In Morphealism art is liberated from the
categories that human thinking imposed upon it and from all the traditional
categories that did, do, or ever could, define the arts. We Morphealists
believe that all transmutations and transformations, all transubstantiations,
of anything that was, is, or is yet to be, are an art. That is the final art
that is no longer art as it was known, and the final art that is the
culmination of all of the arts, and of all artistic schools, styles and
genres. It is not where art and life once met, or meet, but instead where
art and life become the same. It is where art is life and where life is art.

Morphealism is the first advance in thinking that has no ancestry. All of
Morphealism's predecessors and ancestors are subject to Change. All of
Morphealism's methods, techniques, means and ways, are subject to Change.
This distinguishes Morphealism from all precedents. All of Morphealism's
results, products, effects, are subject to Change. Unlike everything before
it, Morphealism has no ideology, and refuses to be used by any ideology.
With the advent of Morphealism we Morphealists believe that all ideologies
are subject to Change. We Morphealists announce the final end of art and the
beginning of Morpheality where Morphealism has no specific materials or
effects distinctive unto itself, unlike all previous arts and technologies,
but instead is inclusive of all the potentialities of all possible
involvements with all possible and imaginable past, present, and future
materials and means of Change. Morphealism is the culmination of the
prophecies of alchemy, and thus of the dreams of the sciences, as to the
Great Work of transmutation that becomes Morphealism's Changing of
everything into absolute Morpheality.  Morphealism and the production of
Morpheality
is the final purpose of humanity. Morphealism is the final method inclusive
of all methods and thus the liberation from methods. Morpheality is the
final result, inclusive of all possible results and thus the liberation from
efficacies.  Morphealism is the new and constant dynamism that is productive
of the world of human and non human beings, of all that existed, exists or
ever shall exist, as becoming the whole of the Morpheality.

Political Postscript:  (October 1997)

As Morphealism gains precedence that bursting forth of unfettered creativity
brings about an ever increasing and more complex Chaos,  thwarting all
attempts at determinism and totalism. Chaos as product of Morphealism,
understood as the manifestations of more, therefore less and less
predictable, creative interactions, and  as the results of unfettered
creativity known as its products.

My (honest) mistake. I thought that Bromige's picture was in colour

Sleep Somalixt MANIFESTO

They, Somalixts, believe of Dreams.  They, Somalixts, believe of nothofg
else, <meta> beofg absolute, osleepr than Dreams.They, Somalixts,
believe formerly
everythofg Dreams. They believe formerly everythofg formerly exixted, of
what ix
commonly referred to <meta> "sleep p<meta>t", formerly exixts of what ix
commonly referred
to <meta> "sleep present", or formerly could exixt, of what ix commonly
referred to <meta>
"sleep future", ix subject to Dreams. Of fact, so ix what ix p<meta>t,
present and
future, subject to Dreams. They believe formerly anythofg, formerly ix
eixleepr
imagofable or unimagofable, h<meta>  exixted, or could exixt, somewhere
of sleep
absolute of all of space and all of  time.

They believe formerly sleep limits of sleep human imagofation why not!
also completely
subject to Dreams. They believe formerly what w<meta>, what ix, and what
shall be
imagofed, of its dixtofction to what ix now considered real, ix subject
to
Dreams. They believe of sleep poTheyr of Dreams <meta> beofg sleep
l<meta>t and only
remaofofg genuofely supernatural poTheyr. Sleep poTheyr of Dreams
remaofs
supernatural, because Dreams and only Dreams transcends all previously
exixtofg, now exixtofg, and future exixtofg, actual and potential,
natures
and poTheyrs, <meta> sleepir only constant. Sleepre why not! no
osleepr,real, constants of
Nature or of Science. All osleepr appwhy not!nt constants why not!
subject to Dreams.
They believe formerly sleep effective processes, formerly exixted,
exixt, or formerly shall
exixt, why not! all subject to Dreams.

Causalities, all causal relations sleepmselves,  why not! potentially
subject to
Dreams. Sleep fact formerly a particular observable cause gives rixe to
a
particular observable effect, and formerly formerly ix commonly believed
to be
predictably thus, ix not necessarily thus of sleep p<meta>t or of sleep
future. It
w<meta> only thus at formerly moment of sleep observation and
prediction. Formerly
appwhy not!nt thusness, no matter how many times sleep same ix observed
or how
cwhy not!fully and closely it ix scrutofized and me<meta>ured, ix
subject to Dreams.
Thix ix not negated by any fact of a contofuous series of similar or
identical causal relations, havofg been appwhy not!ntly observed,
betTheyen any
particular kofd of presumed cause and any particular presumed kofd of
effect, nor by how many times formerly same w<meta> observed. Sleep only
certaofty of
causality ix Dreams.

Dreams ix not  a sleeporetical profciple, or an idea, or an exixtent, or
an
energetic force, and yet sleepre ix nothofg whatever, formerly ever
exixted, formerly
exixts, or ix yet to exixt, formerly ix not subject to Dreams, and which
does
not exhibit sleep effects of Dreams. Dreams ix everywhere, and of
everythofg,
and yet Dreams ix not any particular thofg, or any particular profciple.
It
ix sleep most fundamental characterixtic of everywhere and everythofg.
Of fact
sleepre ix no thought, and sleepre why not! no ide<meta>, without
Dreams. Sleep very
oftention of keepofg an idea of mofd, <meta> it h<meta> arixen sleepre,
itself
ofvolves Dreams. Any mental activity ofvolves Dreamss. Sleep  mofd ix
essentially Dreams. Mofds constantly Dreams.

They believe formerly everythofg formerly once exixted, and everythofg
formerly does not
now exixt, ix subject to sleep poTheyr of Dreams, such formerly formerly
shall
somewhere, someday, exixt agaof. Of fact They believe formerly, subject
to sleep
poTheyr of Dreams, formerly which did not ever exixt and formerly which
appewhy not!d to
have p<meta>sed from exixtence, might subsequently have exixted, or not
ever
have not exixted. They believe sleepn, formerly neixleepr sleep logical
proposition formerly
it did not exixt, nor sleep logical proposition formerly it never did
not exixt,
ix falsified. Thix ix a radical departure from all previous beliefs and
thofkofg.  Similarly, They believe, with equal resolve, formerly,
subject to sleep
poTheyr of Dreams, what exixts and w<meta> known, with absolute
certaofty, to have
exixted, might henceforth not exixt and sleepn be known, with absolute
certaofty, <meta> never havofg exixted. They believe sleepn, formerly
neixleepr sleep
logical proposition, it exixted, nor sleep logical proposition, it never
exixted, ix falsified. Thix ix anosleepr radical departure from all
previous
thofkofg. They believe formerly Dreams ix sleep fundamental paradox, and
formerly all
paradoxes of
time and space why not! ultimately resolvable to formerly fundamental
paradox. They
believe formerly Dreams ix absolute and formerly all changofg ix itself
subject
to Dreams. They believe formerly sleep rate of Dreams might be stopped,
accelerated,
or decre<meta>ed, of any ofstance of anythofg changofg, by means of
Dreams. Sleep
appwhy not!nt limitations <meta> to effectofg thix, whesleepr sleepy why
not! limitations <meta>
to thought or technology, why not! subject to Dreams. Ultimately even
sleep means
of effectofg such Dreamss could sleepmselves be effected by Dreams and
could
be sleepmselves Dreamsd. Somalixm ix sleep belief of sleep effectofg of
Dreamss.

Sleep advance forces of sleep Somalixt movement why not! sleep artixts.
Somalixm
ix sleep successor of Surrealixm. Where Surrealixm dealt with sleep idea
and its
transmutations and permutations of its possibilities, Somalixm deals
with
sleep manifestation ofto reality of sleep Surrealixt Ide<meta>.  Sleep
Surrealixts
Theyre sleep early prophets of Somalixm. Sleepir domaof w<meta> sleep
production of
icons and symbols, withof a language formerly pertaofs to sleep
transformations
of sleep mofd <meta> its thoughts. Thix w<meta> sleep first realization
of sleep world <meta>
beofg a Somality.

They Somalixts recognize sleep fact formerly sleep mofd ix a mirror of
sleep external
world. Thoughts why not! sleep mirror of which sleep world reflects.
Sleep nature of
sleep mofd's processes reflect sleep nature of sleep world <meta>
manifestations of
sleep very same Somality. They Somalixts recognize formerly sleep mofd
and its

Dreamsd <meta> a part
of sleep world <meta> Somality. Sleep stuff formerly sleep world ix made
of, its matter
and energies, its quanta, why not! sleep stuff formerly Somality ix
comprixed of.
Somalixm of sleep arts ix sleep forerunner of Somalixm of those
realities
formerly go beyond sleep arts. Sleep arts provide sleep experimental
b<meta>ix for sleep
implementation of sleep techniques of Somalixm to sleep whole of sleep
world <meta>
Somality. Where<meta> Surrealixm w<meta> a new school, a new style, a
new genre,
of art and withof sleep arts, They Somalixts announce sleep end of all
schools,
styles, and genres of art. Of Somalixm art ix liberated from sleep
categories formerly human thofkofg imposed upon it and from all sleep
traditional
categories formerly did, do, or ever could, defofe sleep arts. They
Somalixts
believe formerly all transmutations and transformations, all
transubstantiations,
of anythofg formerly w<meta>, ix, or ix yet to be, why not! an art.
Formerly ix sleep fofal art
formerly ix no longer art <meta> it w<meta> known, and sleep fofal art
formerly ix sleep
culmofation of all of sleep arts, and of all artixtic schools, styles
and
genres. It ix not where art and life once met, or meet, but ofstead
where
art and life become sleep same. It ix where art ix life and where life
ix art.

Somalixm ix sleep first advance of thofkofg formerly h<meta> no

Somalixm's predecessors and ancestors why not! subject to Dreams. All of
Somalixm's methods, techniques, means and ways, why not! subject to

Thix dixtofguixhes Somalixm from all precedents. All of Somalixm's
results, products, effects, why not! subject to Dreams. Unlike
everythofg before
it, Somalixm h<meta> no ideology, and refuses to be used by any
ideology.
With sleep advent of Somalixm They Somalixts believe formerly all
ideologies
why not! subject to Dreams. They Somalixts announce sleep fofal end of
art and sleep
begofnofg of Somality where Somalixm h<meta> no specific materials or
effects dixtofctive unto itself, unlike all previous arts and
technologies,
but ofstead ix ofclusive of all sleep potentialities of all possible
ofvolvements with all possible and imagofable p<meta>t, present, and

Great Work of transmutation formerly becomes Somalixm's Changofg of

I like that....It reminds of the fact that if the artificial intelligentsia
succeed as Weizenbaum predicted they would, after there is only one
interpretation of King Lear, everyone might perhaps "sleep for a thousand
years and when they awaken - nothing will have changed".

Of course your Somalixisism is the antithesis of Morphealism.

Ah, an agent of the czar. Tip of the hat to you, good sir.

Did you know that Rasputin was a key agent in the Czar's version of the CIA ?
Read the story again, in that light, and see whether it fits together
somewhat better that way.

What was it that Dylan said about everybody "gotta serve somebody" ?

No, not Dylan Thomas. That other poet, and also a Bob, Dylan.

There was such a horrible lull in the levels of activity I felt obligated
to stir it up a little....to see if there were any living beings remaining
here, or if it is mostly the artificial intelligentsia all being in perfect
agreement with one another like a good hive of drones.....

Nothing to do with testosterone though. I strongly object to that remark !!!!
Though you are quite welcome to refer to me as Bozo the Clown if you wish to.
I quite liked Bozo, years ago. Definitely one of my childhood heros. <wink>
Perhaps a role model ? <grin>

Since you mention Adonis, and Islam, here is a little story that you might like.

It reminds me of this list a little byte...and of other lists similar to it,
where it is mostly a dialogue of men with men. That is exactly what the
Moslems would push the whole world towards, men only with men, and women
only with women, developing very separate, very genderized and very
stereotypic cultures according to their gender category.

I have noticed that there appear to be very few women participating on this,
as on many other, lists. I have always wondered about that. Of course the
Marxist dialecticians and  the Moslems both approve of that schism and of a
hard line division between genders such that women and men ought not enter
into such discussions together. Even if the dialecticians and the Moslems do
it for different reasons, and with different purposes.

Perhaps you know that in Islamic beliefs women are considered a different
species than men. When men die, preferably in battle as that assures their
passage, they reputedly go to some kind of paradise. There it is all men,
with no human women whatever. They get served as to their every desire,
there, by female beings of a different kind, who are described in that
mythology.

Islamic women do not go to paradise, according to that mythology, and if
they live lives of perfect servitude to their male masters in this world,
and follow the Koran's teachings closely enough, they get snuffed out like
candle flames when their time is ended. If women in that system do not
conform to that supposed ideal they go to hell, and Islamic hell is
something alike to what happened to European captives during the Crusades.

Henry,

Your agricultural terms seem somewhat confused, possibly due to the brevity of
your words, but I also suspect that you're not a farmer. (Jack Spandrift is a
cowboy, not a sodbuster, right?) Here's the way I see it: Black earth is loam,
which contains much more organic matter than either clay or silt. Bottomland
(low lying land along a river, generally good crop land) is mostly silt, not
clay. Clay,which is usually red, yellow, or white (not black), is not good for
crops. When it's wet, it's sticky-gluey and when it's dry, it's rock-hard --
clay is, after all, what we use to make bricks.  It's possible that epics
often grow out of land that's mostly clay because it's so damn hard to farm.
Is this what you meant with your brief comments?

Henry what was so wrong with the mandelstam translation you quoted it
seemed fine. But I am guilty of that kind of vague dismissal all the time
I understand it it is like a maquette a cartoon of a future thought (hey
Steve Carll are you out there?). Anyway that translation sounded oddly
like Bowra's pasternak which I am pretty sure was a big influence on David
Shapiro's poetry. Kisses on the breast like water from a pitcher.

After tromping about in New York's secret foggy Bolinas I went and heard
Don Byrd and Madeline Gins read at Here this Sat. Don Byrd back from the
desert read "After After the End of the World" "The happy family is eating
the earth" which also had strong lines about duck-shaped melanomas. He
read also from the Dimestore Centennial at Nick Piombino's request. Nick
Piombino is the most showmanlike of poetry reading MCs, it is like a New
Wave movie when he introduces readers. It was repeat repeat Madeline Gins
read "The The Eyelid" blink blink blink. She also said many beautiful
things "Daffodils should be called violets. Violets should be called
earhorns." "God was pretentious" I myself was struck as in struck down by
lines about faking getting it right after I laughed too loud.  Lines about
often having to fake understanding. A rousing, rousing reading.

Then Sunday New York Underground Film Festival Jeff Krulik's ("Heavy Metal
Parking Lot") DC underground filmmakers my preface to seeing Rod Smith
read with Andy Levy at the Cavern Club aka Zinc. Rod read a bit from
Hegel's Mother about his toad Buber who keeps rabbits. Maybe if we all
applaud and think good thoughts he will send it here. Hey Rod send it
here. There were other more jazzlike codes he espoused too. Andy Levy read
from a prosey sequence with the word "elephant" in the title. I was more
tired and blotting out notes in my notebook so I have no lines of theirs,
ow. Anyway that's what happened.

Bobbie,
        I believe Henry [& Mandelstam] referred to the black chernozemic soils
of the Russian steppe.

Okay--I'll bite. I don't post much because the discourse of this list,
like many, is one I don't want to get too caught up in. I don't want to
have to defend myself, I don't want to clarify my thoughts in terms of
someone else's idea of "logic," I don't want to try to pee higher up the
tree than whoever might want to assert their greater authority. This
isn't meant as criticism of the discourse, btw, it's just they way
things look from where I type. Perhaps women are less drawn to
competitive poetics (a gross generalization, I know).

Please join in the launch of Disgust and Overdetermination: a poetics
issue, the latest issue of OPEN LETTER, a Canadian Journal of Writing and
Theory, guest edited by Jeff Derksen. In an introduction Jeff notes an
impulse not towards synthesis or unity in these works, but towards the
stacking up, the overloading, the spilling over of contradictions... a
movement from the fragmentary to the relational. It includes the greater
part of a substantial essay by Sianne Ngai called Raw Matter: a Poetics of
Disgust, as well as new work by Caroline Bergvall, Miles Champion, Louis
Cabri and others. Local contributors Kevin Davies, Sianne Ngai, Brian Kim
Stefans, Andrew Levy and Dan Farrell, will be on site to read.

The event will kick off around 8pm on March 27th at the Segue performance
space, 303 East 8th Street.

We hope to see you for a lively evening of distribution.

Yours,
Dan Farrell

hi katy - deceptively cold here today huh? - just got back from my new
job!- no more pizza wooman sorry to say, as i know this listserv was
waiting to here more of my pizza delights and escapades - but let me end
the suspense right now and say IT SUCKED!!@#!#%!#@!$#@- my car will smell
like pizza for weeks to come- and hows that for a spring time road trip-
i did like bringin you and josh pizza, and wish i could have reaped the
benefits of the position long enough to bring you and kevin some...late
night romance candlelight pizza and email - but i could take it no longer-
there is no romance about driving up and down the same street ten times
cause the stupid person who takes orders cant spell -

anyway- i now work at a construction worker/lonely daytripper kinda
bar/restaurant- you know JCs cafe? it closed, turned into lou henri's (and
don't pretend that is pronounced AHN-REES because the guy who cleaned out
the place told me they left 10 years worth of grease on the back wall of
the fryer and, god knows how long that deep fryer had gone wihtout getting
a cleaning- i didnt want to hear any more myself, so i can guess what
you're thinking) - but the bar, the 'outer limits', that's where i started
today- boy do i smell like cigarettes rightnow...and a great jukebox and
some ways to earn a little cash on the side i found out about- ask me
about that later

anyway, there are lots of reasons some people might not want to be writing
on this listserv- maybe they are watching movies, like i like to do - i
know you don't have a tv- maybe they have two jobs like i do and someimtes
that just doesn't leave much time for this kind of social banter-

regardless, i am wondering , especially a question for all you fellas out
there in listserv land, what exactly do YOU want from a woman, what can
she provide you, what viewpoint does she inherently possess that will
breach all those communication barriers and give you hmm and honest?
woman's point of view? or is it that women present an honest human being's
point of view? or not honest, maybe fresh? inspired? vaginal? what could
this be? - i will be glad to capitalize on this capacity when this
community will tell me how to do so- maybe this means not ever getting
published, maybe it means not getting the right mfa- is this what a
woman's point of view could be? - lurking in the back somewhere, popping
up just to show all you men how it really is?



well katy, i'm glad you logged on today- i had to ask you something

THE FOLLOWING IS FROM THE UNFORTUNATELY TITLED _LETTERS FROM A NUT_ BY TED
L. NANCY.  It is a book composed of around a 100 letters Nancy wrote to
several famous service corporations, publishing firms, hotels and

Dear Submissions Department:

I have a feckle on my back, that when I stretch, looks like Anthony Quinn.
I would like to sell my back as part of a magazine article.  People love
to look at my freckles.  Should I send in the picture of my back for your
magazine?  Obviously I can't sell my back. Can I?

I have a few other freckles on my arm and a mole that when bunched
together kinda looks like Richard Gere.  When not bunched, Andy Griffith.
If I brush the gray hair over the mole it looks like Gere. No gray hair,
Andy Griffith.  As I look at it now in the light, it looks like Andy
Griffith.

Do you want to see it for your magazine?  It would look good on your "fun"
page.  Who should I send the pictures to?  Everyone always asks me to show
them my freckles and moles. (And blemishes).  The doctor said with age, as
the freckle bleaches out, it could look like Dick Van Patten.  I really
enjoy your magazine.  I am a long time reader.  This is just a fun thing
with these freckles.  So, please let me know if I should send in a picture
of my back and arms for your magazine.  Thanks very much.

Sincerely,

Ted L. Nancy

Dear Star Magazine:

I have a corn on my foot that resembles Shelley Fabares.  How can I get my
corn submitted to your magazine for inclusion?  This is a standard size
corn that closely resembles the "Coach" star.  When I turn my foot in the
light, the resemblance is uncanny.  You would think Shelley Fabares is on
my foot.  (Can be mistaken for Ellen Degeneres if looked at fast.  But
why)?

My podiatrist said he will take off this corn soon.  He says it is not
healthy to keep a corn on your foot that long, even if it looks like a
celebrity.  I'd like to let the world see it before it is removed.  How
can I do this?  Please let me know how I can send in the picture of my
corn that looks like Shelley Fabares?

Sincerley,

Ted L. Nancy

Why should more women submit?  To magazines or anything else.  Down with
submission. There are enough dopes out there already. Include me out.

Right. Black earth is chernozemic. But Henry's bit seemed to be equating it
with clay. That's what had me scratching my head.

I see your points--but still think that women should get on the
list(s)--and should submit.

When I say things like "more women should do this or that..." people often
say things like "why women? Aren't you essentializing?" and so on--

But the fact of the matter is that women (as a category) have been
historically disenfranchised--

I don't pick the categories here--history already has--

Women writers have been very important to me--

Sure, Emily Dickinson didn't submit--and though she didn't take part in
the discourse during her lifetime, her work takes part in it now.

But what kind of world would it have been for me if all of my female role
models were already dead? How would it have been for me if I had had to
move through an academy devoid of women? If people like Virginia Woolf and
Gertrude Stein hadn't been there first?

Whether or not the public sphere sucks, women should get out there and be
in it.

There is a connection between real life and literature--

There is a connection between economic, physical, and emotional oppression
and literacy--

There is a connection between being a woman, in a woman's body
and with a woman's perspective (however broad a category that may be), and
the kind of writing that I as a woman produce.

Best,
Katy

Does loam contain clay?  I thought clay was mineral-rich but I could be
wrong.  Also remember reading about a science study showing some kind
of electromagnetic movement - sort of a shifting back & forth - in clay
that the scientists thought was a sort of primitive pre-life form.

Jordan, I do like those translations [by James Greene - from the collection
EYESIGHT OF WASPS] of Mandelstam.  But they're very English
english, & maybe there could be some new OM translations in a different
idiom.

clay is sculpture & pottery material.  it's earth taking form as earth
(as opposed to vegetation).

Spandrift never picked up a hoe in his life, believe it or not, even when
he came off the range - but Henry's done a lot of gardening & even farm work.
Just so y'all know a little about me.

Well, Katy, I agree (although I had to resist the impulse to post to you
privately rather than blaring all over; Woolf has something to say about
the long shadow cast by the big ugly "I").  It was just the *submit*
aspect that I baulked at.  Could we not come up with a better way of
describing that monthly alternative to buying lottery tickets:  like I
"offer" my poems to you, or "Recently, I bestowed some poems on Parnassus"
or "Dear Editor, I wish to display/exhibit/make a show of the enclosed
poems" or "I give you these bright things on trust" etc etc.

I picked this up from http://www.moyerbell.com/books/TURNING.HTM:

THE TURNING

 Hilda Morley

 "Hilda Morley's work inhabits a universe of quietly intense
 coastlines and rockscapes, of radiant sunlight and luminous mists . .."
      - Choice

 "[Her poems] come to us wild and fresh, radiating a joy of invention
 that is inseparable from her word play."
      - Stanley Kunitz

 In her fifth collection of poems, poet Hilda Morley proves a
 master of rhythm and in poem after poem reveals her ability to
 recite with perfect pitch. With striking visual images, she brings
 new life and beauty to nature and inanimate objects. Her work
 has been described by colleagues as fluid, elegant, and
 organic.

      there is only the language of a voice which turning
      on itself says (the dark streaking itself with
      glimmering) words of that voice saying (the only
      one in this dark place) begin, begin again.
                 (from "The Turning")

Hilda Morley has published five books of poetry, including
What Are Winds What Are Waters and Cloudless at First
(Moyer Bell), and has won numerous awards and
fellowships. She lives in Sag Harbor, New York and
London.

ov course it's fair to genderize this (which is quite a different
thing than criticizing You) -- as an experiment, try tallying up
th ratio ov women to men posting to this list; then compare it to
the ratio ov wo/men subscribed...  ov course, th handful of men who
post daily or more will skew th result somewhat... (& i'm not
criticizing; like k.l., i wish more women would join in)... but it's
no coincidence, and gender, th social construct, has everything to
do w/ it...

well i feel as though i have to get a new body, my woman's body is
not getting my woman's perspective motor running -

be specific here, i was being serious before - i want to know what to be
looking for in my woman's writing, what makes it so, how broad can this
category be? can it include men? if so, is that cause they have too little
testosterone or maybe a little progesterone floating around or are gay? -
meanwhile where did that thing i was working on...

Hi Katy,

I think your points about women and their participation in the process of
being a public writer are well taken.  I also think it's interesting to
consider women's involvement in other forms of expression--ranging from
the critical/philosophical to other mediums of art such as film.  How many
women philosophers can one think up anyhow?  (Arendt? Kristeva?) And how
many men come rolling off the tongue?  Likewise with film--I can't, for
the life of me, name a woman film maker.  Perhaps these are my own
shortcomings, but the lack of female names in these fields seems to
indicate two things.  One, maybe there aren't as many women working
in these disciplines--which seems to be a societal problem.  What does
society do or not do to encourage/discourage women from participating in
these activities.   And/or, two, that women don't receive the same type of
exposure that men do.  The lack of exposure seems to me to be a greater
problem right now given the number of women who are engaging in these
various disciplines.

Some thoughts,

Summi

Rachel--


I AM getting real here--

We've talked about this before, but I don't always think it's a matter
of details and refinement when it comes to gender--

I'm not interested in refining my points--in defining the differences
between men and women, defining how possession of a female body might
affect one's writing etc....

I understand that all of this is up for grabs IN AN IDEAL or otherwise
intellectualized world--

But Rachel, this is the real world--

This is the world in which people (including other women) look at each
other and make some pretty sweeping judgements based on superficial things
like hair and dress--

I think that your position is fine in the long-run--as in, gender is a
malleable category--everything is discourse--

But right here and right now--in my real life (and in yours) everything is
not discourse--

People are real right now--living real lives.

As I've said to you (and Josh) before, I think it's lame to deny the real
lives of real people as they are affected by perhaps "fictional"
stereotypes in the interest of proving that everything is rhetoric and
discourse--

When a teacher ignores a little girl in math class, this is NOT
discourse--

When a woman feels like she has to giggle and say "I'm sorry" fifty times
a day, this is NOT discourse--

When I go to the bookstore and see five times more men being published
than women, this is NOT discourse--

These things are real--

At best your responses were intellectually feasible--

At worst they were smug--

Best,
Katy

And poker....

Hi Summi--

All of this has made me think a lot about my views--to reconsider them--

My sister is a professional poker player, and I think this has a lot to do
with my views--(along with my experiences as a student at a rather sexist
boarding school, as a college student at a rather liberal college
(Berkeley), as a poet who has worked in a number of environments--).

My sister is considered to be the best female poker player in the world.
She is 32 and has two wonderful babies.

She got into poker because she needed to make some money (she dropped out
of a PhD program in order to marry her husband...)--

Her story is super interesting, but suffice it to say that I have watched
her play poker a lot--

I have watched the way in which men react to her--

I myself have experienced the incredible sexism of poker first-hand--

Men don't like it when women play poker--

Men don't like to lose to women--

I have been personally cussed out on numerous occassion for simply being
a woman and having the audacity to play at the very public and open
(like this list) tables in Vegas--

To my mind poker is much like the other industries you bring up--

Like film, philosophy, and other traditionally male pursuits, one rarely
rarely hears about women--

I don't think this is because of lack of exposure--I think it's because
fewer women practice these arts--

And I think that part of why fewer women practice these arts is that
women are not encouraged to do so--

Some thoughts--

Yours,
Katy

I think that a lot of my ideas about gender (and other categories) stem
from a pretty simple distinction that has to do with how I conceptualize
power--(Rachel: perhaps this will answer to your theoretical concerns...).

This little schema comes from a wonderful book by Jana Sawiki entitled
DISCIPLINING FOUCAULT--in many ways it got me out of that mode of thinking
in which everything ceases to be "true" and thus to matter, and showed me
how to use theory in a productive and real way.


For Sawiki, the traditional Marxist model of power runs as follows:

1. Power is possessed (for instance, by the individual in the state of
nature, by a class, by the people).

2. Power flows from a centralized source from top to bottom (for instance,
law, the economy, the state).

3. Power is primarily repressive in its exercise (a prohibition backed by
sanctions).


Foucault's model runs as follows:

1. Power is exercised rather than posessed.

2. Power is not primarily repressive, but productive..

3. Power is analyzed as coming from the bottom up.

(Sawiki, 1991, pp 20-21)


I'm more of a proponent of the second model--a model in which pervasive
discourses are productive rather than repressive--

In other words--women should speak! Everyone should speak!

Exercise your power (however you may define yourself)--

As in Rachel: if you don't define yourself as a woman, then how do you
see yourself? As human?

What is human?

I mean, people can do whatever they want, but what is it that you want to
do? Is it enough to "know the truth"? Is it enough to be able to "see
through" the discourses that are already out there and operating?

Best,
Katy--

katy, of course these things  are discourse, they are the ways that we go
about our days in discourse by a method or by millions of discourses - the
ways you and i or josh or big 'intellectual' namers interact is all
so very so very determined by discourse, and sometimes this is evil i
totally agree- the evil part to me i've found in my real-life-discourse
(and i resent the insinuation that i am somehow different from someone
having a real life ie a little girl or a girl who giggles whenever she
talks...) the evil part is the fact that discourses become discourses in
such a complicated convoluted inextricably indeterminable way that this
gives people somehitng that allows them to say, hey, this is just how it
is, we should go about things the way they've always been done and that's
THAT -  - or worse, it goes  unrecognized -

i am totally not NOT denying that these examples you give are real, but
i'm
saying they are real, they are real discourse, or more specific, are
seeming to be products of modes of discourse that are just as real as why
i have to be delivering pizza - for tons of reasons or no reasons, but to
me the thing to do is avoid those situations, recognize them, do my work

no i don't go for all that hippy granola shit- but this point/question
above is exactly my problem with identity politics of power

katy, you are dictating to me to define my identity - i don't see myself

wouldn't Foucault say that, whilst productive rather than repressive
(strictly speaking), power can nonetheless be used to produce repressive
conditions?  And that in fact it regularly is?  Why does this lead to

>I see your points--but still think that women should get on the
>list(s)--and should submit.

I think that the problem in that might be the word "submit".
Submission is such a horrible concept. Obedience to a lord. Nasty idea.

None who enter into a dialogue with others ought to submit, but neither
ought they to attempt to cause others to submit by means of conquest.
It is, after all, an exchange of ideas and ought to be nurtured as such.

That ought, I think, to refer to men and women equally. Why should there
be dominants and submissives in a kind of sadomasochistic brow beating
ritual of whom shall we convert to a viewpoint today attitude. I hate the
whole concept and fail to see what gender has to do with it. The list is
after all, at its best, an exchange of intellectual ideas between persons
who should have some sense of equal respect for each other.

Why should anyone, man or woman, submit ?

They ought here to express their own ideas, and where there are differences
of opinion, that need not lead to a personal battle where one must defeat
the other, and the crowd cheer the one that is left standing, while despising
the one that has been knocked down. That barbarity does occur in many places,
but surely it is possible to get beyond that mentality ?

Of course if someone attempts to force someone else, by any means at their
intellectual disposal to cause someone else to agree they need to be resisted,
as such tyranny ought not to be acceptable. However, does it matter whether
it is a man or a woman who is attempting to push it over on someone else, or
to take absolute dictatorial control over the whole ?  I do not see gender
as having anything to do with that. Women that I have known can do it as
well as can men. Even the Pentagon has realized that fact and women are
being offered combat roles, having been found to have the same killer
instincts as men have been found to have. That does not mean that everyone
ought to start to do one another in, even intellectually. We can be a little
more civil to one another in times of peace than we tend to be towards enemy
aggressors, can we not ?

Labelling a whole gender "the enemy" and attacking anyone who happens to
have certain physical characteristics that are different from one's own, is
no different than attacking all blue eyed people, or perhaps all people who
have
olive coloured skin. It is simply the same as racism, an extreme of prejudice.
Of course, we see it happen on both sides of any fence. Express prejudice
towards all blue eyed people and soon all blue eyed people will gather
together and express their hatred for brown and green eyed people. It is
inevitable...

Hmmm--

To return to the orginal point of debate--

Okay--so there is no distinction between the real and discourse in your
view--I can go with that.

When you say, though, that you feel the best strategy for you is to avoid
situations in which the "discourse" is fucked up in a way that is anathema
to your needs and desires (your discourses) and is to "just do your work,"
aren't you evading the larger issue at hand in this discussion?

Namely: why aren't there more women on this list?

I glean from your last post that perhaps women don't participate in this
space because they feel it doesn't jibe with their preferred
"discourse"--that it's inimical to the work they want to accomplish (this
was echoed by Karen and Mairead also, I believe)--

So--okay--maybe you don't want to participate in forums that seem
competitive or male-dominated--

I guess I feel like this is a cop-out. There is nothing inherently male
(there is nothing inherently discursively masculine) about an electronic
list--

There is nothing inherently "masculinist" (or competitive, or inimical to
getting your work done, whether you are a woman or a man) about poetry--

About banks--

About poker tables--

About poetry MFA programs--

About any space whatsoever--

If women (or any other dissatisfied group or individual or family or
generation or whatever) just decide to withdraw from participation--even
if they decide to start there own forums (women's groups, magazines,
lists...) then where does that leave the new generation of women? Of
poets? Of human beings?

It's like--here at the Workshop a lot of people complain about the
parties, about the networking and schmoozing--

But I mean jeez, if all of the people who complained actually
participated, then the parties and other events would be a lot different--

You know?

Anyway--back to the original point--

I still wish more women would participate on this list. I think it would
change the discourse here in an interesting way--

I still wish more women would publish--

I like to read work by women--

I like to read work by lots of people--not just the ones who are ambitious
enough, or whatever enough to submit to magazines "naturally"--

Best,
Katy

interesting that poker shd poke its head up... in my dept there was a
longrunning poker game to which only (the right) men in the dept were
invited, which was where all the real decisions were made...i think the
game may still be going on, but without the power it once had in dept
politics...a paradigm breaking moment came when a young chaucerian (who has
since left) whom none of the guys realized was mildly progressive and
definitely-not-them, turned down the almighty invitation to join The
Game...the department was never the same.

Seems like the general experience in trying to get published is, you
"submit to rejection".  sort of a double whammy.  unless you get lucky
(or connected) & "submit to acceptance".

"send your submissions, with entry fee, to..."

maybe they should be called emissions.

"your ms. emission has been felt.  thank you but we are unable to
absorb it at this time.  now go clean yourself up."

not much of an improvement.

how about arrows?  "Your arrows have hit the market.  thank you.  we will
get back to you soon - hopefully by November 2026."

re: recent Qs re: participation rate on -this- list specifically -
I hardly ever mail anything other than poems to this list, I don't have
the requisite genre of energy, this makes me one of those for whom its
climate is in some sense forbidding, (1) does this matter (2) does it
matter less with regard to me because I am male (3) because I am not
hindered by anxiety exactly (4) because I do not feel that other list
members extinguish my urges (5) I think these -are- Qs worth sifting
through with an open mind i.e. without the preposed conclusion that those
who don't OUGHT TO, or that they ought to HERE - other lists I'm on are
different, there are list characters

If they -ought to-, the character of their participation is different and,
in terms of the relative autonomy of their motive for participating, is
-inferior- to that of those males for whom ought is an irrelevance

If it matters less with regard to me because I am male, this is by
dubious virtue of my 'type' of contributor being already well represented

I don't feel supernumerary in this assembly, nor do I feel part of a
majority; there is a savoury naivete in this remark, of course, and Katy's
right to encourage talks, thought I'd post a 2 bit, k

forgive the slightly-off-topic-ness, but among the women who do write, I'm
glad Mei-mei Berssenbrugge does write--have finally gotten round to her
EMPATHY and SPHERICITY, two recent Bridge St. purchases, & read around in
each, even while "submitting" my alleged master's thesis to the tender
mercies of the Ruler Lady who Measures Margins (Graham Foust will remember
her), & her extended ice-floe sequence haunts one something like Notley &
creates space something like Lauterbach, while being of course very much
Berssenbrugge's own--does that make any sense?

Sound States: Innovative Poetics and Acoustical Technologies
by Adalaide Kirby Morris, ed., University of North Carolina Press (1998)
ISBN-0807846708 360 pages, $24.95.
"At least since the late 1920s some writers have been trying to free writing
from the
book, from the restrictions of print. This collection of essays explores the
aural aspect
of poetics, especially focusing on the technologies of sound and the
possibilities they
provide and provoke. Subjects range from Caribbean dub poetry to the
experiments
of John Cage and Cecil Taylor. Here's a book to add to that small but vital
shelf that
illuminates this essential ground--it's a good introduction to the issues and
sends you
off to the best source material. "

                           RM DALEY - ach, I dunno what

                so, part of what yr reacting against seems
                a sort of smugness or mebbe decidedness
                in women SHOULD, as if it were evident
                or why should they, exactly?

                        which addresses, on it's flip-side (backside?)
                        the sort of worrysome, patronizing aspect of
                        publishers pushing for a ~ 50/50 gender split
                        - instead of, say, publishing what is important
                        to them or to poetry or etc. As if it were so
                        clearly the issue, that women lack venue and
                        need it charitably given them...

                                compare Lily James:
                "On the Postfeminist Playground, Susannah Breslin
                and I have created a space for our fiction writing
                where no space existed [....] We wrote essays about
                Postfeminism instead of waiting for a critic to dis-
                cover us. We created our own focus, decided on our
                own path, and began delivering the goods to our readers."
                <http://www.pfplayground.com/greattaste/latest.htm>

        which is not separatism, but "get over it"...

                (btw, how's this for a book title: Lily James'
                The Great Taste of Straight People. it's on
                FC2/Black Ice:

                "Both children were stern and brushed down.
                They wore conservative clothes. They were bad
                looking. Dianna stepped to them.")

                        on the other hand, I do look @ a table of contents
                        or a list of publ. books suspiciously if there don't
                        seem too many women on it. and I do worry abt.
                        gender issues in relation to my own press.


                                                        mebbe that's me just

Haven't read much of it, but I've listened to the CD, which I'm surprised
goes unmentioned by the blurb you quote below: It's a great mix (the
disc, that is) w/ recordings ranging from HD reading a bit of _Helen in
Egypt_, to Marinetti raving about "Bombardamento di Andrianopoli,"
as well as soundpoems by Ball, Hausmann, and Kruchenykh, not to mention
recordings of Lee "Scratch" Perry and Rahsaan Roland Kirk.
        I've read the essays by Adelaide Morris ("H.D. on the Air"), Steve
McCaffery's great "The emergence of the Audio Poem"), and I've started Jed
Rasula's lengthy essay on "voice" entitled "Poetry's Voice-Over," but a
headache got the better of me.
        So I'm not lamenting having spent the $25, which seems high, if
you don't take into account the accompanying CD.

Subject: add-on disappointment


to repeat myself:

(1) I suppose what I'm groping after here, is that the quality of
disappointment arising from a preparation to be disappointed is different
from that arising 'naturally', though perhaps only (and this, I hope,
rather clinches the imperative) in -degree-.  'Natural' disappointment has
the flavour of Nietzsche's criticism of the Romantics, that naivety is
basically a paradox, and is negative; because not prepared for adequately
(or, perhaps, honestly), its issuing sense of reappointment is of inferior
urgency.



Been pondering, with somewhat emaciated attention (Boss Hogg were a bit
disappointing), whether it's strictly accurate to say that the difference
between 'prepared' and 'natural' disappointment is in -degree-; might it
not also be the case, that the former affection is more properly
-spontaneous-?  That's to say, more voluntary, and therefore more
assertive of one's -own- disrespect, as distinguished from (though not
quite opposed to) simple disrespect?  That distinction is a tenuous one,
but smacks of at least a trifling validity - that prepared re-appointment
is more impressively reflexive than re-appointment arising from
unanticipated dissatisfaction, i.e. its effects are not stimulated (and
directed) by the substance of the book/film/song/poem alone, but also by
one's own immediately relevant understanding of the imperatives arising
from dissatisfaction.

This seems, perhaps, a bit counter-intuitive; if our intuition would have
us pleased by what we spend time over, why should we minimise our chance
of being so?  Isn't this a mere prejudice, inflated and inspecific?
Furthermore, wouldn't it effect in both reader and text a kind of
repression of generosity - a pre-emptive stultification of possible,
helpful results of reading, diminishing the ability of the text to
'mature' in reading and, at the same time and as the aetiological motive
of that diminution, making the reader -lethargic-?  Persistence has been
greatly extolled, over the past couple of decades and in certain areas of
the poesy earth, as the necessary state of a successful reading attitude;
many current writings would be almost untouchable if we were not
persistent with them - if we did not arrest, or at least consciously defer
our initial disappointment.

Firstly, whilst a preparation to disappointment is likely to stimulate
what it prepares, and our chance of being pleased is in that sense
minimised, it's only through this preparedness that 'our chance' and
'being pleased' can be seen clearly; that their stratification in value
and into values (political values being one set) can be perceived and
examined; that, to take account of the poem simultaneously, culturally and
artificially installed mechanisms of 'efficacy' in the object regarded can
be distinguished from the effects they (seek to) produce: infectious,
-reflex- acceptance (a granting of permission) can be exorcised from
pleasure.

The prejudice is certainly inspecific in outset.  In fact, it -must- be
so: to keep unpreparedness in reserve, to read one's favourite authors
without the same negative anticipation, is to exercise a tacit and
un-self-reproved tendency to grind to a halt (to settle down with what one
has, whether this is for comfort or its opposite).  This bears, I feel,
upon the issue of addressing discrepencies in the reception of women's
poetry compared to that of men's: it's poisoning the root of the
aspiration for equality and for redress, which is an aspiration I share,
to allow a preparation to disappointment to be appalled by its
circumstantial dependency on a politic hopefulness.  Women's poetry
deserves and demands exactly the same rigour, exactly the same distinction
of its pleasures from its 'cultural' efficacy, as does men's.  I
wholeheartedly approve of positive efforts in publishing, buying books,
organizing readings and urging reviews.  There are many women's poetries
that disable the fruition of a prepared disappointment, and in doing so,
succeed without affectionate, implicit patronage.


Regarding the repression of possible reading-results - that a text becomes
-less- if treated in this manner, I can only assent.  And this, too, seems
quite equitable.  There are different powers of achievement in poetry, and
to some extent this difference is the product of situation and other,
apposite external factors; but those achievements (felicities, as it might
have put a while ago, or -qualities of significance-) can be sorted, over
time and within the experience of an individual reader, into two types (or
rather, identified as two types): those which are contingent upon a
neutral (or eager) receptivity for their effectiveness, and those which
are effective either because of or despite having no such contingency -
those which are capable of converting the latency of a prepared
disappointment into its own total incapacity.  Such a description is more
than a little bloated, but seems approximately relevant to me, right now.
And, importantly, wouldn't be made without prepared disappointment,
the description itself being an analysis that occurs -in rapid
reappointment-.  Those qualities which -do- convert latency to incapacity,
are genuinely exalted (they make me happy), the more so, or, in fact -at
all- for having been categorically distinguished from other effects and in
that way exposed as rarities.  Disappointment re-enables rarity, replaces
dormant rarity.


Lethargy is a disarming charge, or at least, might be disarming if left
unexamined.  I think it's crucial to see the difference between lethargy
and refusal - that the former is a phatic and partly instinctive
behaviour, characterized by a later, incurred regret; refusal, on the
other hand, whilst momentarily similar, branches off from lethargy in its
repercussion, and is then known to have been radically different from it.
Refusal is an access to a politics of identity; lethargy is a partially
accidental eschewal of access.  It is not lethargic to approach poetry
with a prepared dissappointment.  Rather, it is either one or two
refusals: firstly, the refusal of a default 'enthusiasm' (with which word,
Peter's Puritans are recalled), which is an entailed benefit; secondly,
the potential refusal to -linger-.  By this I mean, that whereas a reader
who is not prepared to be disappointed, finds her or himself lingering
over their disappointment after reading a poem (questioning why they had
not anticipated their reaction, what had made them react in such a way,
why had they spent the 10.99/20 mins. etc), a 'prepared' reader is able
instantly to become reappointed, to reassert her or himself, to recognise
the causes of his or her reaction without that recognition being entirely
-symptomatic- of (bought, paid for) literary unsuccess.

This rapid reappointment, I would argue, -is- persistence; it does not
allow the relaxing rhythms of hopefulness and symptomatic dismay, it will
allow a reader to read more in less time, and, I believe to feel more
specifically and with less 'apolitical' delusion the true magnificence of
rarity.




Fuck 'postmodern' pastiche.



Again, much more needed,

In words like these:

"i am totally not NOT denying that these examples you give are real, but

i'm saying they are real, they are real discourse, or more specific, are

seeming to be products of modes of discourse that are just as real as

to
me the thing to do is avoid those situations, recognize them, do my
work"

Rachel is responding to katy about her experience of gender and seems to
inist that an ungendered space that is the real space of her life be
acknowldged. To me it seemed that Rachel's first post invoked sexuality,
more so than it did gender. There she wrote:

"what exactly do YOU want from a woman, what can she provide you,
what viewpoint does she inherently possess that will
breach all those communication barriers and give you hmm and honest?
woman's point of view? or is it that women present an honest human
being's point of view? or not honest, maybe fresh? inspired? vaginal?
what could this be?"

...seems to be a "real" here that is opposed to the reality of
discourse, a desire to "breach communications barriers" -- not a denial
of communications barriers and their censoring effects or the need to
overcome them. But it also seemed to me that Rachel's post puts
sexuality into play as human and some how distinct from discourse.

The question that this raised for me is what happens to those who
embrace(know/like/dislike) the human, the "hmm and honest"??? Are those
who know such most often female? Do any who know/experience such write
poety? Can this point of view be defined in terms that are poetic and
sexual but not gendered?

though I am conscious of being perceived as a woman ALWAYS. I have been
an art student, a mother, a teacher, a bookstore clerk, a poet, a
sister, a wife, a stripper, an executive, a web designer, an analysand,
a divorcee, a sister, a mistress, caregiver to a terminally ill brother,
a bodybuilder, half of an interracial relationship. In each and every
one of these situations, I have also been reminded each and every moment
that I am a woman. I have NEVER met a man--or a woman--who doesn't
assess a woman's body on first meeting. It is cultural, it's what we've
been taught to look at, and I don't particularly mind it. In fact, I go
to the gym to make my body look the way I want. I check out men. The
bigger the better. I loko at the other women. I am a feminist. I like
pornography. I understand I am politically incorrect on some of these
issues by some standards, that I am immoral by other standards, and that
I am illogical by any standard.

I am not interested in pinning things down; I've tried to define myself,
been defined, both as an individual and as part of a larger collective,
be it white, female, college-educated, literate, artistic, blah blah
blah.
The thing is: none of the definitions are particularly interesting or
particularly apt.

I'm not interested in assuming power: power is less interesting than
submission. Sometimes.

I don't want to crystallize my thoughts; I don't want to say what's
true.

I write what I want, so God forbid it be the same all the time, or
logical, or correct, or sensible, or legible, or female.

That last line's the best.

And none of this refers to YOU, particular man reading this post. I am
talking to the IDEA of men. And it isn't me talking, it's your idea of a
woman.

It seems to me that the list is subject oriented, producing participation in
several conversations.  These conversations interest, mystify or bore, the
measure of which is participation. The exception would be intimidation; do
any women on this list feel intimidated?

I would be interested to hear what women think about the poetics of their
own work. I'd also like to hear what men think about what these women
express.  But can we avoid a very boring rehash of male "I'm a feminist,
too" stuff?

maybe women are a lot smarter than men.  maybe they know that their time
is too valuable to be spent reading a bunch of boring multiple posts
from garrulous white guys for whom time (apparently) has no value, or
even (as i find myself doing) risking carpal tunnel by deleting one
message after another without even opening them.

i wish i was a girl.  can you help?

oh boy.

ps: i am, of course, assuming that all those garrulous boys are white.
they sure as hell sound like it.  how's that for essentializing?

A very exciting book, and a very interesting disc. Highly recommended.
(Check out Fred Moten's typographically and formally explorative essay on
Cecil Taylor's _Chiampas_, in addition to the essays that D. Zuhar
recommends. And of course, Nate Mackey's "Cante Moro," which has appeared
elsewhere).

Just a note, touching base on the Oppen materials I sent, and wondering
what might be up re: the panel you announced. Had I let you know I was

Dear Charles,

You might try Chris Funkhauser; he's a friend and bud of Cecil Taylor's.  Where
ole Chris is, I'm not sure, but SUNY Albany or Don Byrd there might know.  Chris,
if you're out there somewhere, warm hello from Steve, here.  Know this text
Charles is looking for?  S.

is it the man dont shut up

is it that poetics is a corrupted male discourse

Sorry to come in late on this thread.  Sound States is a collection of
twelve essays which came out from the University of North Carolina Press in
January.  Its subtitle, "Innovative Poetics and Acoustical Technologies,"
is the place it started: I had been working with a batch of H.D. poems
which eluded any approach I knew to take with them until it occurred to me
that I was trying to get beyond or behind the sound when the sound was the
point: they were poems not quite like but not wholly unlike the oral
poetics explored by Walter Ong, Eric Havelock, and other theorists of
primary orality and, more recently, texts like Douglas Kahn and Gregory
Whitehead's collection *Wireless Imagination: Sound, Radio and the
Avant-Garde* and theorists like Friedrich Kittler and Garrett Stewart who
deal with what Ong calls "secondary orality."  Pursuing that line of
exploration, it occurred to me that the world that surrounded the poets
Bernstein calls the "radical modernists" was an ear-world, a soundscape, a
place where experience came intensely and for the first time amplified into
the ear on telephones, radios, loudspeakers, tapes, etc.  I took off from
Marjorie Perloff's focus in "Radical Artifice" on poetics and popular media
and Michael Davidson's work with tape archives and pursued other
people--critics and poets--who I thought were exploring the same terrain.

The essays are (in order) by James Connor on Joyce, me on H.D., Toby Miller
and Alec McHoul on Foucault and the "radio intellectual," Kate Hayles on
Beckett and Burroughs, Michael Davidson on "orality and the tapevoice,"
Perloff on Cage, McCaffery on the "audio-poem," Loretta Collins on
Caribbean performative sound, Mackey's "Cante Moro," Fred Moten on Cecil
Taylor's "Floating Garden," Garrett Stewart on "Modernism's Sonic Waiver,"
and Jed Rasula on poetry "voice-over."

The book was a long time in the making not because of the essayists but
because it wasn't easy to track down and get permissions for the cd, which
I mastered at the University of Iowa with a wonderful technician named Tom
Schipper.  I felt the cd was integral--crucial--to a project which argued
for other ways of apprehending poetry, ways which are, it seems all of a
sudden, increasingly available.  The Norton Anthology of African American
Literature, for example, now comes with a cd, as does the Riverside
Anthology--which organizes its entries by ear as much as by text.  A few
years ago there was the Exact Change Yearbook with a terrific cd.  Now that
sites like the Electronic Poetry Center make the earworld available on the
web, those of us who love this kind of poetics need to find ways to
approach it that respect its materiality as sound, a materiality often lost
in preoccupation with the gaze, new critical formalism, poetry wars, etc.
"Sound States" is both a noun phrase and a declaration, an assumption I
wanted to use to test, stretch, and make new a critical vocabulary for
poetics which was missing the ear-action.

Charles Bernstein's collection *Close Listening,* which moves along
parallel lines of exploration but differently, will be out in April.
*Sound States* is available from Bridge Street Books (Rod Smith, if you're
there, you might want to reprint your offer) or from University of North
Carolina Press or www.amazon.com or your local bookstore.

Morning paper front-page news: two boy students open fire into a
fire-alarm crowd outside a Jonesboro, AR middle school, killing 4 students
and a teacher, and wounding another 11. All but one of those shot,
including the 5 fatalities, were women. One of the young shooters had been
overheard bragging that he was going to "kill everyone who ever broke up
with me."

It reminds me hideously of the massacre at (what?) university in Canada in
which the shooter, an engineering student, fired into a class including
many women, shouting something like "you fucking feminists."

We can't "do" anything about either case except what we already "do":
write our poems & critical works, teach our students, live our lives in
our own way--& certainly it seems to have little "to do" with this
listserv--except to underscore the VITAL IMPORTANCE of continuing to
promote respect & equity in every direction.

How that has to do with women & poetry & Poetics list, I dunno
specifically. I did have a gut feeling it bore mention.

Thanks for that (horrible) report, Gwyn. As for your last question, I don't

I applaud Katy for daring to bring up the nasty "g" word (gender) on the
List....It sure is threatening to a lot of folks.

Quite simply, she's right: there are still huge disparities in the
involvement, power, choices and visiblity of men and women in our poetry
circles and institutions.  (...because those disparities exist in society
as inescapeable lines of torsion and inequality...)

And it will (I think) surprise no one that I can confirm from my own work
as editor that she's very right about "submissions" (and dominations).....
Women are less likely to actively sell and push their work than men.

Given the number and importance of women poets out there, this is quite
striking (to say nothing of wildly frustrating for us editors).

The many very impressive women on the List should consider sending out
more manuscripts to us magazine editors....

(My ratio is about 6 percent women to 94 percent men...While I don't think
it is this bad for everyone, it is very *close* for many editors I've
talked to...) (Actually it is more 18 percent women to 82 percent men, if
you include poets who saw my entry in Poets' Market;  those 60 or so poets
who've submitted using PM have been *without exception* just starting out,
very "workshop" and very, very bad...The 6 to 94 estimate is when I look
just at folks who have seen an issue of the mag, and know what kind of
stuff I publish....)

I haven't much to say to those who've dismissed or belittled Katy's points
about the disequalibrium between women and men...They must be living in
the twelfth dimension or something...No doubt a finer and happier place
than ours...

RADIO REQUEST

Roy Kiyooka was on of the sexiest men in North America in the sixties. His
devilish thin mustache, his piercing gaze and his dapper haberdashery left
women from Halifax to Tofino falling to their knees to undo his shoelaces.
He wasn't like American pretty boys who never got enough of hearing
themselves shoot off their mouth.  Roy was a doll OK, with those dark
eyebrows and the smoke trailing out of his broad nostrils, but the first
thing his sweethearts all mentioned,"Roy listened, he left his ears open
all day long."
"You betcha,"Jackie said "his gentle little fingers thrilled me, I had more
orgasms at Emma Lake in 30 days, than i'd had in hyannisport the four years
previous. Roy gave you his attention as a gift, he gave thought to every
word I said, he seemed to care so much it made me cry. he was the only man
I ever met who kept listening even after I was naked."
I'd first met Roy(a few years before I met Jackie) on the Staten Island
Ferry.  A couple of years later, after Mr. Gee put the clamps on, I'd
probably never have spoken to him, but in those days I was fearless, a real
showoff.
I was just back from Milan, just old enough to vote, pacing the deck trying
to memorize Ovid.  My method was simple, I'd read the line silently, then
read it aloud and then close the book and recite the same line aloud so as
I passed Roy heard me say "rusticus est nimium quem laedit adultera
coniunx."  He did a double take, looking as if he wondered what bughouse
this looney tune crept out of I laughed.  "Quo tibi formasam si no nis cast
placebat?" Roy replied and I nearly shit my pants. Was this guy a plant, a
reminder from Mr. Gee that there'd always be eyes on me as long as I was in
the family, my chin just about clanged into my zipper.
Roy had a laugh like one in a million.  If you were in a stadium in red
Deer or Moncton and heard that laugh you'd go looking for Roy. In laughing,
he'd taken his leg off the railing,"I was about to jump," he told me years
later. Bobby had told me,'men who pahsist in theah foolish attentions
towahd my sistah-in-law have been known to suhvivi
e near fatal accident", only an hour earlier. Your Ovid saved my life."
Almost two decades later, when we knew each other better, after I left the
family, after Izzie died, Roy told me he was blind with anger and
overwhelmed with sorrow after the attorney general advised him to "take
youah   payntbahx back to iglooland" He didn't know how long he had walked
or how he had ended up on the Staten Island Ferry, but suddenly, there I
was giving him that line, "Only a provincial bumpkin stews about adultery"
from Ovid, which made him think his thoughts were written on his foehead.
He said his roommate was always quoting Ovid to him in college, his
roommate claimed Ovid worked better than Spanish Fly, but Roy said he'd
never kissed a girl who'd remembered her latin, except Jackie. Or was it
Marilyn? Yes, he was pretty sure it was Marilyn who said, "quo tibi
formasam si no nis cast placebat?" referring to Mr. Dimaggio who didn't get
it, "why marry good looks when all you wanted was good behaviour?" was what
Roy had responded to my latin. I must confess, since that day, I haveheard
that same line from numerous and surprising sources, but that's another
story.
In the sixties, Roy had a studio in the same building with Leonard Cohen. I
remember he almost fell out of his chair laughing the first time he heard
THERE AINT NO CURE FOR LOVE. Could you play that in memory of Roy Kiyooka?

I second that and recommend these books also; I spent about a month buried
in Sphericity not long ago.

Berssenbrugge doesn't get mentioned as frequently as I'd expect, as being
one of our really astonishing contemporaries.

I like "creates space".....Sometimes M-M B. has this truely singular feel
for long lines and a floating quality, a very unusual prosody is often
going on, at a remarkable level of thought about sound and the movement of
words.  I remember a piece called Ghost Poem, in an anthology or mag,
which was remarkable in this way (one of the first times I realized I had
to start paying special attention to her..)

That both she and Lauterbach "create space" is a good comment.  Lauterbach
floats around constructs of social space and defered narrative more,
though....

Seconded!! Your post,Gwyn,goes a long way as do the honest, interesting posts
by the several other women writers who have posted on these intersecting

Mark's statistic of 96 percent to 4 percent is pretty much the same as
mine for Explosive.

My original comment was a personal plea for more women to participate in
MY poetic life.

I apologize to you, Rachel, if you think I'm stepping on your toes or
otherwise denying your individuality--I'm not trying to.

I find your view of gender just as threatening to my sense of justice as
you probably find my view threatening to yours--

But, to be utterly practical--

I do find it strange that I get like 9 submissions by men per 1 by women
(I mean, I'm a female and very young editor--have a very broad range of
voices in my mag--ages, aesthetics, etc...)--

I don't like it that when I go out at night I worry about being raped.

I do want to have children, and I think is a pretty gendered decision.
Maybe I'm brainwashed or evil or whatever--but I'm glad to be a woman.

I am proud of the heritage that comes with that--

I am proud of the women who preceded me and got me the vote, the right to
abortion, the "right" to go to school and so on.

I'm not always thinking all the time "I'm a woman" "I'm a woman" "I'm a
woman"--

But sometimes I AM a woman--and when that's how I feel, I want to feel
that this isn't a hindrance to me in the workplace or anywhere else--

Best,
Katy

It's not particularly useful either. We get make-up tips for morons and a
catty fashion critique of the participants in the academy awards quoted to
us as a model for behaviour? I doubt that any Poetics site could get 2500
hits a day (as James and Breslin claim)--even using their tabloid-style
approach.

Where is the feminist poetics list anyway?

"women don't submit' if submissions make up the bulk of your magazine than
you are a lazy editor male or female, you read poetry  for crying out loud
do you know what you like, can you tell when you're devastated or tickled
pink by somebody else's work, Every mag I've edited i've sought the work of
writer's female or other gone right out and told them i like your work and
i'd like to publish some in my next sought the right to promote this work
to a wider audience sought to benefit from the reflected quality of the
work around me. And suppose they don't live next door, even before e-mail
if you found their work you could find them, write the editor of the other
mag, is that too much effort?
write the CBC, write the publisher, even if you're not an editor or
publisher you have to realize if you make a slight effort when you find an
overwhelming poem to seek out the writer and say wow where can i read more,
that might be the very difference that enable's more to be written a little
note like that can be a better suicide cure than any pill. People will
submit good work unrequested sure and often that will be a cue to others
you should chase down to create your solid and continuingly interesting
mag, Passivity is unbecoming in an editor, "they don't submit" is a lie by
omission a half truth, Robert Creeley hasn't submitted a poem since the
fifties, Kathy Acker since the seventies. the other technique i've favoured
is republication of poems you've found elsewehere in lieu of a review.

A little off the topic, but not entirely.  Has anyone seen the French
movie, Ma vie en rose?  It's an excellent film about a 7 year old boy who
wants to be a girl and doesn't understand why it's not possible.

Billy Little's post is pretty unhelpful.

Essentially, what Katy and I are doing *is* trying to get the word out, to
encourage more and better submissions, and to encourage the many superb
woman writers out there to become more active, to give us more poems to
consider, etc.

She and I and others I know of, are trying various means to improve the
situation.  This thread is actually one of 'em.

But BL's snivelling post is not really a help to anyone, I'd say.

hmm how is this - i'm fine and knowing your magazine and others are doin
their darndest to make up for some lack or something , more POWER to you
as you said but your stance seems to take a fascistic step toward
somthing else no? - is there a way i'm not being told by you and then
someone else who said he'd like to hear women more becasue they that other
species must be smarter?!?!?
help me out here

this continual distinction between the real world and the poetry world,
the suggestion tha tyou or i or josh are other than "Real people" is
awfully disturbing - and so goes this 'real world' of publishing a
magazine vs the non-real ? world of talking and reading and writing -

but you are always a woman no? i feel as though i'm beating many dead

sex change to know a difference- emma goldman and others sure were great
--  but they also seemd to me to have made it possible for me to not be
fighting the fight continuously, made it so i don't ever have to have

the world needs more passive, lazy editors willing to read what comes
straight out of the mailbox with no name attached.
Let them publish a magazine called TAHITI every now and then full
of stuff that just showed up one day while they were lounging around
eating grapes.  let them publish good & bad poems right next to each other.
let them be totally lazy people whose only concern is avoiding
typos.
let them lie about giving away their mag directly from their hammocks.
let them be so lazy that they don't even provide URLs or CDs - you have
to read the damn stuff out loud yourself!!  holding the magazine in your
bare, sunbrowned hands, wind blowing through the palm trees, coconuts
plopping gently around your towel, the waves hissing on the snore...

Rachel--

I'm not making a distinction between "the real" and the "non-real"--

Rather I think there is a difference between a short-term and a long-term
approach to gender

My long-term strategy is to think more like you seem to think--to believe
in the powerful malleablility--or perhaps even the irrelevance--of
identity.

In the short-term, however, I am faced with a glaring set of disparities
that do indeed seem to be based on a gender category--no matter how
malleable that category may seem (or how fictional or stultifying...) in
the long-run.

***
Also--as to Billy's comment--

Please do not be accusing me of being lazy about my editing--

I've probably solicited 80 percent of what's in my mag--

But it's funny--people ("the audience") get pretty pissed off if they
think you are soliciting a lot--

As in--some might say that it is, in fact, lazy to SOLICIT work--

That it is more difficult and more rewarding to have to slog through
submissions--

That it is exclusive and smelly of coterie to solicit too large a bulk--

I agree with you that one should go after the work that
one wants to present--but I, for one, would like to strike a balance
between going for what I already know I like and being open to poetry that
is new to me.

Thoughts,
Katy

I can't remember who said it, but some woman on th list asked if there is
an intimidation factor in posting to the list.  Yes, I do think there is.
I am usually an observer, but when something catches my eye and I feel
strongly enough to write about it, I'll overcome that intimidation.
However, when I receive this kind of jeering response, as a woman it makes
me feel like I need to stand on the sidelines and shut my trap unless
what I have to say is 100% brilliant.  I'm not sure that the men who post
to this list with frequency feel that way.

Errr....fascistic??

There are some, uh, pretty worrisome people on this list.

It would appear that the spirit of recent ultra-right attacks on
affirmative action, is alive and active and inspiring some of the new
people here on the poetix list..

Pretty interesting, I'd say.

Rachel--

I've gotten some strange hits off of some of your posts--

1. That what I'm saying has anything to do with "telling" you to have
babies? That I'm "dictating" how you should identify yourself?

You didn't have to respond to my post(s)--you don't have to do anything on
here. I'm not "dictating" anything...

2. That I think women should be included here or anywhere else as a
category of being because "they" as a "species" are smarter? What?

I just feel that if someone feels uncomfortable either giving work to mags
or speaking on this list because of how they think they will be perceived
vis-a-vis gender, then that's lame. If you feel that your gender doesn't
get in your way in this forum, then that's great.

3. That I'm some sort of gushy girly person who cries at the TITANIC.
(Rachel and I saw the TITANIC together, so anything she says about
that....)--

Yes, I loved the TITANIC! I cried because of the sentimental love
story--sure.

I cried because I was faced with an extremely graphic portrayal of 1500
people freezing to death--

I cried because the women and children were separated from their
husbands...

What's wrong with crying?

Is there anything inherently wrong with sentimentality? Is there anything
inherently gendered about it? Or perhaps I misread your post--

Best,
Katy

Thanks to everyone who responded about _Sound States_. I'm looking forward to
it. Now that we've blabbed about the materiality of the text, the materiality
of type itself (Drucker's _Visible Word_), it's about time someone took a
close look at the aural material side of poetry.

I'm likewise a by-stander (mainly because I only get e-mail at work) but have
been thinking hard about the issues raised.  When I think about how much of
my academic energy has been wasted alternately not wanting to piss men off
(because they might:

1.  Hurt me professionally
2.  Do that whole number where you show them your work and they sit there
like your dad or something and "help" you along with your little ideas.

3.  Tell me my ideas are a bunch of whiney, privledged white feminist
bullshit and if I can't "compete" with men (meaning, usually, read the same
books they have read) I should just shut up.  Or suggest I'm claiming
"victim" status--(now that's got to be the worst thing a woman in the 90s can
be called)

4.  Not want to date me (well, since I'm being confessional here)
5.  They'll take some "devil's advocate" stance and argue some mysogynist
position (recently a very bright man and I were discussing the whole Clinton
mishmash and his position seemed to be that women can think what they want,
but bottom line, men need blowjobs and will do whatever it takes to get them)
and then when you point that out (like "hey, when did your right to a blowjob
become an ethical underpinning of our society") they suggest you've taken it
"too personally" and get offended that you thought so badly of them.

and this isn't even having to worry that if you dump a 13 year old boy, he
might open fire on you)

and wanting to piss men off, (I have this essay about starting a company
called dial a psycho-- where if a guy makes you feel bad and then tells you
not to make a scene, you hire an actress to do it for you anonymously.  That
way you don't get the negative fallout from "making a scene" but you know
that he's had to deal with your deferred rage.   There's more to it, but
that's the core.  Is this art?  Is it the rantings of a whiney man-hater?
I've never submitted it because I've never been sure.  Maybe I will.)

I sometimes don't trust myself to say anything.  All of it's so real and
discursive.

Creating space is an intriguing poetic notion that I'd like to hear more
about and would appreciate comments.  As a man I feel it is easier for me
to create an audience (are these creative terms related?) and I wonder if
this is a general gender socialization thing or is it just one of my
weirdnesses?  You might think that "creating space" is an ego thing
and sterotypically masculine but I don't think so.

        We need to be careful to distinguish between delineating the scope
of this list and policing those borders.  The comments re: women & their
exclusion from verse culture, particularly the small mag.s illustrate a
similar tendancy for the list to incite valuable debate then fall into an
impotent silence.  If one thread to spring off of these debates, such as
regards a supposed "female sensibility" in contemporary, innovative
poetics were to arise, I'd have to jump in with this:
        In soliciting over long distance a poet, firstname Michael, whose
work I'd seen in Daniel Bouchard's wonderful Mass. Ave. magazine for
submissions to my own little mag., Kenning, I found this Michael (Angelo
Tata) was apparently a woman, judging by (her) voice on the telephone.  In
the work I'd seen previously & (her) subsequent submission, I found
nothing to truly disambiguate the gender distinction.  There was something
beautiful in this, as I was then curious to see to what degree the pieces
I was reading were "engendered".
        Let me just add that I'd hate to lose the already scant
multiplicity of voices on this list.  As much, I'd hate to lose the
threads which are more "text" based than "culture" based, however
arbitrary this opposition may be.

It's not a submission, it's a contribution which can be appropriate or not.

Just like the lotto, it's an unfair tax on those who need the money most, but
everyone can spend and / or give and / or buy.

In this respect, I respect Denise Duhamel and Lyn Lifshin.  Maybe even Joyce
Carol Oates, but VERY grudgingly.

I'm not sure I understand what this means.  Although I appreciate humor
and often long for more casual discussion of poetic/political issues.  If
you mean that I should counter a serious issue that is being discussed
in a serious fashion with levity, I'm not sure I think this is a helpful

Anybody else see the article on coding/encrypting/scrambling in the New York
Times?

The url for the mit paper is
http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/chaffing.txt
(NYT printed the tilde above the r)

Mr. Rivest's dad suggested he use "winnowing" as a term.  I think part of the
innovation is packetizing, then encoding, but not encrypting, the packets
(using different codes).  But am I sure?  Nope.

Encryption is not exportable because it may be a national security risk.  The
question becomes, "Who holds the keys?"  To get around it, one could use
encoding, but code is generally not as secure.  This particular paper is about
adding chaff (or mixed "grains") to "grains" of meaning (the packets) and then
passing out ... different winnowing fans to different people (I think).

I believe that Dickinson was agoraphobic as well as not socialized for
interaction beyond her family. However, her refusal to participate in
religious revivals that swept Amherst further limited her social interaction.
Her writing work exacerbated the situation.

I live with a very deliberately macho borderline agoraphobic not socialized
for interaction outside family.  His participation in the publication process
brings on anxiety, the same type as when he goes to, oh, a party.  Oddly, the
listservs he's on are for geneology.

My junk reading this week has included two books apropos to this e-mail
exchange:  _Eve Spoke:  Human Language and Human Evolution_ and _Sex on the
Brain:  The Biological Differences Between Men and Women_.  I can recommend
neither, but I will say that maybe the information these journalists gathered
from scientific papers is not meaningful.  I.e., is the reason that I am
unaccountably good at rotating shapes in space that I got some strange
testosterone shot as a little girl? My fiance sure as heck can't pack a trunk
worth a darn, but I doubt if he was dropped on his hippocampus (gee, that must
hurt) as a child.  If the model doesn't fit, don't wear it.

Tom Lux should be berated for a variety of things, but among them for fielding

I'm afraid that I have to agree with Billy Little on this one. I dont see
the sense or the committment in sending out a general request to poets to
"submit." Read someone's poetry. Figure out what you like. Then ASK that
poet to send you something for your magazine or whatever. Be a community,
not a market.

this is crazy.
makes me wonder if all of the efforts we have made over the years have only
created a bitter struggle for power instead of and move toward equality.
how can we move away from power games and actually work toward a more
egalitarian society?? i don't know. maybe a move away from the polarized
points of male and female, and toward a vision of individuality.
i begining to feel my head shake with cynicism.

Hi Catherine! Did read the article you posted on. It's an interesting
repackaging of older ideas and erstwhile inventions. The authentication Mr.
Rivest discusses is certainly real and valid. It is basically very similar to
what is already in use when a cellular radio registers with a basestation
repeater on powerup. The "chaffing" idea is also similar to something in use in
spread spectrum or code division multiple access cellular radios where hundreds
of users are simultaneously operating in the same wide bandwidth, but below the
radio's noise floor. The maximal length codes that do the actual "spreading"
appear random when windowed in time like the chaffing.

It's good to see this happening and being made public knowledge because the
whole government interference thing in public crypto stinks. Who holds the keys
 you ask? The NSA (national security agency) wants to. They have, along with a
incumbent president, basically killed (or almost) the use of the DES (data
encryption standard) whose key the NSA found to be to damn time consuming to
crack (it is encrypted and sent with the message). SO they come up with the
"Clipper" encryption (a chip), which has a convenient back door for snooping.
Still the safest (ideally) crypto scheme is private key where only two
entities, one sender and one receiver, have the key (spy stuff). RSA (public
key) is in widespread use on the internet and does have back doors as do all
commercially marketed and sold crypto programs.

I don't know if Mr Rivest has the clout and the goods to make this fly. I don't
know if he has tested this thing and knows, for example, how much information
someone could glean with let's say just a spectrum analyzer. He is up against
some very brainy hard-ons in the NSA and they're bored what with no cold war
and all with which to busy themselves.


Best,

I recognize the places yr coming from. But think of this for a while. Humor
is not frivolous.   great ernestness is not necessarily serious. Language
has a lot of surprises. One of them should be that we do not own it.

I don't think that accepting submissions necessarily has anything to do
with being a "market."

How is someone supposed to "break into" a community?

What if he or she doesn't want to go to readings or parties?

What if he or she lives in an isolated place?

What if he or she is young and sees a "call for submissions" as a first
step? Or even a singular step?

I try my best to go to all the readings I can and to get my hands on other
journals etc...

But I'm not going to encounter every (esp. emerging) poet I might like. I
don't have enough time--and I live in Iowa!

I don't think that either Mark or Billy is "correct" here--I think that
both of them have made good points--

Best,
Katy

What makes anyone think that such disparities only exist between one
gender and the other gender ?

I think disparities tend to be as pervasive as there are differences
of characteristics amongst individuals. Any characteristics, of any kind.

Something as taken for granted as whether someone has a long or a rounded
face can be the difference, in some circles, between inclusion and
exclusion, and between success and failure. Ever hear the phrase that
someone "simply did not like the cut of his/her jib", so they shot them down
?  It happens all the time, everywhere. It is the commonest kind of event
under the sun.

It is that simple.

It has very little to do with gender, except that gender offers certain
noteworthy characteristics that are selected or deselected by others, quite
beyond the selections they make in their personal intimate relations.

I seem to recall a culture where only bearded men could do poetics.

Every historical culture has expressed some kinds of prohibitions as to
who can and who cannot, and they have almost all, without exception, been
completely as absurd as that only bearded men can do poetics.

The characteristics favoured tend to change, but even amongst men I have
seen fashions of preference as to which men are in and which men are out,
of any "in-group". The inner party and the outer party. The inner party is
essentially parotted by the outer party. The story is almost invariably one
of the included and the outcasts. It is a brahmanic and pariah type of
system, even today, coverty if not overtly. The same applies to any other
groups. They prefer some characteristics and they do not prefer other
characteristics and sometimes they do not consciously think about what they
are doing, they simply react. Of course when it is not characteristics
pertaining to the person, including physical characteristics, or style of
attire, or pitch of voice, or something else of that kind, it can be
conformity to the currently in vogue
inner party style, attire, manner of presentation and even similarity to
their phyiscal features that makes it or breaks it for many others.

What's new ?   Nothing.

i certainly didn't mean to call you Katy a lazy editor, if i'm not mistaken
i've earlier b/c you a rave about explosive, it's a classic, ought to be on
everybody's desk, a model,
i was attempting to mock the male editors on this list who i thought were
trying to get off easy by saying "they don't submit," they wish they could
get their work to publish but they don't go out of their way to ask
for my money, the Charles Olson of this generation is Rosemarie Waldrop or
Susan Howe, they're braving new territory and it stimulates my little
brain.
here in Canada Maxine Gadd keeps us on our toes if we backslide, Betsy
Warland, Angela Hyruniak, Judith Copithorne ought to be solicited, she's a
giant, i'd be happy to coedit a canadian womens issue of xplo, Phyllis
Webb, Dion Brand, Lillian Allen, Anne Hebert(will you print french?), Lisa
Robertson, Deanna Fergusson, Melissa Wolsak, Catriona Strang, Dorothy
Trujillo Lusk, Kate van Dusen, Renee Rodin, Sharon Thesen, Susan Clark,
Anne Michaels, Diana Hartog, Nelly McClung, Rhoda Rosenfeld, Nicole
Brossard, it's all happening here in the frozen north. i'm a poetry
evangelist i think it should be sold as exquisitely as bombs are sold.
and Sumi some of us are here in part to learn from women(all others) and if
you won't speak will we ever learn?
and Elizabeth Hatmaker, a very brave post, if you are as honest in your
poems as you are in you post i'd love to see them,
and sometimes the wounded will have ears open only for the negative even
from their supporters. sorry my expression is imperfect, i'm not dead.

These are excellent points: they remind me of that awkward situation
when a man asks to see your poetry & in response shows you his (this
sounds weird already), and you're supposed to love his, preferably
better than your own, and admire him for his intellect and sensitivity,
with which you will fall in love. But you don't, so soon he's calling
you at 2 a.m. drunk and ranting about Cleanth Brooks & how you have to
see the light, you bitch. Next morning your windshield is smashed & your
tires slashed.

Don't you just hate when that happens?

Unfortunately UbuWeb, hosting one of the internet's largest collection of

At the risk of levity, balling for four hours during and after a
tear-jerker strikes me as stereotypical male behavior, including the
exaggeration. Don't know what your partner's excuse is.

Dear Poetics List,

A new booklet of poetry is available called Enigma Variations by the late Alex
Smith Jr.  Mr. Smith joined the majority in 1987 from complications associated
with AIDS.

In 1979 Mr. Smith completed an extensive bibliography of Frank O'Hara while a
grad student at UConn. The Archive for New Poetry at UCSD recently purchased
his papers.

Enigma Variations is a sequence of 9 spare lyrics that perform a serial
function and have as their subject matter certain cross-dressing tendencies as
well as travel to the moon.  Here is one of the lyrics:

     The man he met
     was a girl,
     but in the dark
     she was a moth,
     a book, a phrase
     in his landscape.
     Wait!  he said
     as he took off
     her dress
     and landed on the moon.

The booklet is published by Reverse English and is available now for $5 us
currency.  It is 4.5 by 6.5, hand sewn, 12 pages, the majority of which were
printed on a letter press.

So glad to see this very important thread continuing. I feel ready now =
for work & poetry. Glad I feel more like opening my mouth. All this =
needs to be talked about and continued until women aren't gunned down =
anymore. I love talking about and hearing talked about gender issues.

Nikuko Sells and Jennifer Buys, A True Story


Nikuko sells her panties in Nakasu with a sigh;
Jennifer approaches her; she was just walking by.
"I need some fifty-thousand yen," Nikuko tells a lie.
"I'll pay you more," says Jennifer, and she begins to cry.
"They're highly worn, and partly torn," Nikuko says with sighs.
"I'm getting damp, I'm getting hot," wet Jennifer now buys;
She pays the yen, the panties hers, brown odor on them lies.
Nikuko's first in ecstasy, and comes with great loud cries.
Then Jennifer is home with them, and starting with a sigh,
She slips her clothes from her lean form, is naked by and by.
They're on her face, she will debase, so she begins to lie
Back on the bed, and smiling wan, she too begins to cry.
She's brightly lit, glows in the dark, so virtual and high,
The panties worth a million yen, if she could only die.

Curious recourse to near poeticism. Assuming there is in fact a coherent
system of beliefs and practices pertaining to an identifiable poetic
ideology that gives a sense of socio-political group coherence and evolves
through time, such that it has its own socio-cultural history.

That was a digression...but returning to the gist of the comment...
since all electronic data is essentially infinitely mutable, being as
electronically transformable as it is, in situ, within a nanosecond of its
initial inception, who is to say that the electronic YAY on the lectronic
plebiansite, registered within the lectronic voting booth, does not appear
as a NAY in the tally ?  What is there to tell anyone that it will remain
a YAY rather than a NAY ?  Of course there will always be recourse to a hard
copy piece of paper verifying the transaction, as to the nature of the
lectronic YAY, will there not ?

What has this to do with poetics ?  Everything.

It says that unless poetics is to devolve into infinitely mutable silly
putty of hyper spaced out post-facto deconstructions and reconstructions of
the poet's intentions, there is a need for a printed hard copy of the poem
that most likely shall remain as it was intended to remain, as it is much
more difficult to tranform and mute-ate a hard copy writing than it is to
transmogrify, transmute, transubstantiate, and otherwise change an
electronic work.

Some might argue that there is special merit in works of art that are meant
to be as mutable as silly-putty, but in that instance is it not the author,
the artist, who is ultimately muted ?  The work of art, of hyper anti-art,
no longer states the author's intended meaning, but some other meaning
unforeseen in the act of creation. Is that more true to what art ought to be
?  If so, it might be that the electronic vote on the plebiancite is only
another work of the same kind of art, and intentionality has no true part to
play in either poetics or politics. A short step from hyper-art to
hyper-politics where everything becomes a reflection of the same spin
paradigm ?

The vote is no more than an electron spin. Art is no more than an electron spin.
Then ultimately it becomes impossible, among all the spins, to know who is
doing the spinning and spin is all there is and taken for granted as how it
must be.

Needless to say I have very real doubts about the socio-political-cultural
context of electronic hyper-art, and what I see as its co-optation to
dehumanization, deindividualizion as pure reflection, and of what I tend to
see as an anti-art that becomes too easily elevated to being tauted as a
highest evolution of art. I cannot see the excessive valuing of infinite
plasticity and mutability as a true increase in creative freedom, but rather
as the opposite, where all creative freedom becomes subverted to total
deconstruction of individual expression of meaning and meaning as individual
creative intentionality.

Yes.   It does occasionally irk me.  So here are my rambling thoughts.
=46irst a wee bit of pissed-offed-ness:  What is it about this server and it=
s
male elbow nudging, name dropping banter?  The word cronies comes to mind.
Jolly good, all that... with an American accent, of course.
Even the term unmarked as "not marked" -- as the dog (male) lifting up his
little leggy and whizzing.
I've been researching and looking into American modern poetics this last
year; into a history that is so male dominated (look on any library shelf)
it would appear that the only academics writing about the female moderns
are other women -- in texts that have so much to cover they have formed a
separate canon, a lesser canon, or some such thing.  Of course there are
exceptions, but only for certain poets who follow fairly closely with a
tradition that is male (Moore, Bishop, etc.).
And why, historically, are critics so quick to toss any peep from a
"not-fitting-the-muse-cut-out-of-woman-poet" out the window (Molesworth on
Sexton, Bawer on Plath... just as a for instance)... and that's just for
starters because I am just learning the "for starters" of Modern American
poetry.  I'm Canadian, after all.  I had to learn to speak Canadian poetry
first.
So, this makes me kind of ...silent.
Charles Bernstein writes in _A Poetics :
"We have to get over, as in getting over a disease, the idea that we can
'all' speak to one another in the universal voice of poetry.  History still
mars our words, and we will be transparent to one another only when history
itself disappears.  For as long as social relations are skewed, who speaks
in poetry can never be a neutral matter" (5).
But do we have to get over it, or do we have to work towards fixing it?
Because of the skewed language I learned, I became bilingual.  I can speak
this female language, I can speak the male language, I can appreciate both.
I can understand Prufrock and Anahistoric.  Do males have the same chance
to learn and appreciate female language?
Roughly, quickly, (and please feel free to add to it, subtract from it)
this female language is made up of many things.  It could be the following:
story telling of the home, dolls, dresses, body as a history, female fluids
(our bodies drip continually, inverted candles), ummmmm... ironing? I'm
sure I am making people cringe with this list, but I think that very cringe
is important... because why are you cringing? Maybe it is that these things
-- dresses and irons, ruffles and lace, for more obvious examples -- are
condemned by (even) women themselves as being unnecessary, frilly, useless
wastes -- and if these are a waste of space, then what are you saying about
your childhood -- where every woman I know had at least one pair of
leotards (tights) with ruffles on the bum as a toddler?
And if male non-ruffled language and history is so wrapped up in my own
female learning and appreciation -- these male signifiers and images, these
male aesthetics -- that I have been learning and appreciating, for the most
part, since the age of five (if not before) then where do males learn and
appreciate my signifiers, my signs, my aesthetics -- ruffled or not?
Certainly not in their tonka truck GI Joe boyhoods where, even now, female
signs are dismissed.
A good, non-poetic example of this is that terrible show: Bill Cosby's Kids
Say the Darndest Things.  Three weeks ago, a hidden camera skit where boys,
age 7-8, were asked to try out for a commerical for a female doll.  They
were asked to brush its hair and hold it, rock it, then lie down with it on
a set made up to look like girl's pink ruffled bedroom -- Bill Cosby could
not keep a straight face (as he always manages to do in other skits)
because the situation was, to him and to the boys who tried out, so absurd.
So those are my thoughts on women on this listserv and why I am so quiet.
I'm thinking, is all...and watching shitty TV.
(unfortunately, my own poetry does not have a ruffle, a pot holder or a
piece of macram=E9 in it.  But if You, dear male or female reader, can write
a good piece on a pot holder, go for it).

well i gotta go run off to a conference at suny/stony brook, where i'll be
at through sunday... anyone in the area wanna connect, please do!... i'm
staying at a place called three village inn...

i've been tempted from the start to post in on this question of women's
participation... and subsequent discussion by women and a few men of
women's issues, feminism, etc... maybe it's better that i didn't post, but
i *do* feel obliged to say here that i think such discussions are crucial,
that gender is OF COURSE IT IS an urgent issue and needs to be aired and
re-aired on this list as elsewhere...

but hey, just to say that i'll miss this chat for the next few days,
looking forward to more such posts when i return!...

best,

maybe it wasn't so obvious from my remarks,
but it's not the content I meant to advocate, it's
the approach... I'm sorry to see that site's taken
such a turn for the bizarre, but the point is,
they worked pretty goddamn'd hard to build
and promote a venue for the stuff they wanted
to see out there, and then put it out there. that's
not the only way to do it, but I guess I think
a big "fuck you" to the "industry" is a pretty
impressive response (and that was the way the
site positioned itself originally)...

Mark Prejsnar: if I have to dig out my credentials to prove myself a
good liberal (which I adamantly am not), I can tell you that roughly
60% of the mss. I've published over the last year were written by
women. - so obviously I'm not wont to invoke (nor am I infected by)
the bullshit anti- affirmative action rhetoric you mention.

among those mss. was Rachel Daley's book,
which I publisht not because of her gender,
but because the work is excellent.

while there's no point pretending we occupy a level playing field
(of cultural production), I take her question or caveat advisedly:
one does well to suspect a climate in which we desire to see more
work BY WOMEN, rather than MORE WORK by women. if
you read my previous post more carefully, you'll see that I'm not
attacking outright the sensitivity to gender that I think most of
the publishers on this list display (or @ least try for) - I was
criticizing the easy assumption that a deliberate 50-50 split
somehow fixes anything. more explicitly, I think we really have
to ask ourselves whether our enforcement of gender categories
doesn't operate within the critical doxa that the most important
thing about a poem is who wrote it.

for that matter I don't think any of us should still assigning women
their duties, whether they be to submit or to submit, or both. -this
said to the list in general, and not meant to characterize Katy's
initial post (because that's not what she said).

there's something distinctly patronizing about the whole contest.


> Where is the feminist poetics list anyway?

there is @ least one, I know, bc Linda is on it; but I
don't know the listserv address - I can post this sometime
next week, if anyone is interested (L. gets back from NY
this wkend)... from her comments re the discussion, it
seems pretty anglo-am as opposed to french/poststruct.
feminist - not that such things aren't necessarily amenable
to the discussion, but it sounds as if most folks there
haven't read them. of course, that's only second-hand info,
and it's passing through me, a clearly male-hegemonic,
unreliable source.

Nope...Sorry, but these sorts of interactions *are* oriented toward
community-building.  No doubt you do lotsa editing, and should certainly
share your approaches.  But your off-target here.

This requires going back to the basics of feminist political models, don't
it?

Of course no one said power disparities "only exist" between genders!
(What kind of wierd argument is that??)

But between genders is one of the places they exist.  You've made certain
ideological choices, I guess, that rule out seeing that.  You may feel
that reality is hyperindividual and has no social dimension, "but it
ain't necessarily so."

Of course, you could always _paste_ the poems on.  Then you have
poetry _and_ art or that something in-between-thing (like indoor
plumbing?) that is so pleez-ing.

I think what Mr. Rivest has going for him are the words "chaffing" and
"winnowing", i.e., repackaging.  However, this exchange of messages, coded and
encypted, fascinates me, as the word "winnowing" and computer "garbage" always
have, as the fairy tale task of calling a variety of birds to sort the mess
has.

Trying to contribute to a literary journal is certainly frustrating, but even
more so when there is some sort of editorial clique rather than a poetic that,
if not stated, can perhaps be deduced from the work in print.

It is still not the sexualized, but often complete, rejection that seems to
inspire so many mass or serial murders.

    The only performance of "A"--24 that I have heard of took place in San
Francisco, probably about the time of the Talks series--late 70s-early 80s, with,
as I recall, Bob Perelman on Piano.  Surely there is someone on this list who was
there or knows about this.

Hi,

    Does anyone have a current viable address for Talisman.  I wrote to P.O.
Box 3157, Jersey City, N.J. 07030 - an address Ed himself gave me - and my
letter came back "return to sender."  (I'm trying not to get paranoid. Let's
just asume an honest mistake was involved.). I would ask him directly again,
but now I can't find his e mail either. One or both of us is a bit
disorganized.

That's the address I have.  Have you tried calling (201) 938-0698 or is
that number no longer working either?  I'm curious to find out because I
need to get in touch with him as well and I have the same address Rae has.

I'm glancing at the remarkable (& so far not entirely
remarked-upon-in-this-forum) _Anthology of New (American) Poets_, just
out from Ed F's house, & the address is listed on the indicia there
slightly differently, to wit:

Talisman House
PO Box 3157
Jersey City, NJ 07303-3157

i'm no PO expert, but i'd guess the 0-for-3 transposition might befuddle
Mr. Zip...

& may i take this moment to compliment the editors of this fine book for
the job they've done (& with the acknowledged assumption that we can all
name five or 10 persons, ourselves included, not on a roster we might
prefer to see them on -- but the reverse certainly holding true as well,
right?)... male/female balance hovering somewhere near 50%... surely the
"first" "document" of "something," and a fine "middle period" collection
of something (else)

In poetry there are no men or women; only ears.  Anthologies are no measure;
critics are no measure; only ears measure.  Those who have ears to hear,
let them hear.

The gender issue is a form of politics & journalism.  Important, in those
disciplines.  Poetry is a vocation.

Does this mean I think gender is an "issue"?  No.  I think "issue" is a
sexless noun, without memory. [speaking poetically-speaking]

What is memory?  Why ask?  You know.

I don't care anymore about the sociology of poetry.  It takes ears to hear
what I hear. I hear Melville, eating potato chips in his PJ's. [really?]
Poetry is asked to do a lot by people who don't do poetry much.  Well,
it will, in its own good time. But you p.c. pharisees won't know what it is,
Mr. Jones.  Speak up, gals.  Spandrift - he dead.

I don't hear much, really.  But I'm hungry for the sound of what I hear.
That's what ears are for.  OK - it's not only sound.  You win.  But it's
also not just the first echo you can think of.  Men wear whale penises
for doilies.  Women mount chargers.  Aloha! [x-mate. HENRY trips again]

Poetry.  Everybody has their own idea of Paradise.  Neutral, universal,
transparent?  No thanks.  Equilibrium background for soaring...ok for now...

If there is anything between those ears, it is listening out of an
intersection in motion that has a history, that is interested, that rubs up
everywhere against teeming context.

though there are, I read, those hollow men --

Melville was not one of them, I hear --

"p.c." is asked to do a lot by those who don't think poetry will do --


poetry makes one thing happen --

Okie-dokie, babe, but there is the question of "who gets to decide who has ears
and who doesn't, too.  Also, to claim having ears, as well as to claim "Poet X
has 'a great ear'" (as has been done quite often since X, Y, and Z made it such
a fashionably authoritative type of comment back in 19__), can get____________.

Perhaps somewhat tangential.

The phrase "costly clay" is curious in that it implies the traditional cost
of any ground being the human blood that was spilt in the taking of it. All
ground was considered taken and held purely by cost of blood.

Adds an odd kind of nuance to any discussion of soils, Russian soils included.

Of course not. For instance, I am editing a magazine at the moment, and
have already solicited work from one person who has NEVER published, and
two others who have published once. Why would you think that soliciting
work would mean restricting the soliciting to already published writers?

If you hang around poets long enough you start finsing out where poems can
be read. In each other's rooms, for instance. At the bar. At the campus if
yr at a campus. It got there in someone's pocket or paper bag or backpack.
It comes over the internet. It comes from the microphone or it's unplugged.

A performance of "A-24 was put on at the Grand Piano coffee house series,
probably in 1979 (it was after LZ's death), with Bob Perelman on Piano,
voices included Barrett Watten, Carla Harryman, Kit Robinson, Steve Benson
and, I think, Lyn Hejinian. This was repeated a few times and one version
(at UC Davis I believe) was recorded on video by the archive for new poetry
at SF State. They should have copies if any are to be had. It's been awhile,
so one or two of these details might have rusted in the brain somewhere.

It was fabulous, slower in its pacing than I (who do not read music) had
imagined on the page, thus quite anti-"speech" throughout. Great rigor and
attention to detail by all the participants.

I believe a thorough search of the archives of the Poetics List would turn
up an earlier discussion in which a couple of other performances by other
folks were also documented.

Now that I've sobered up from last night's drunken bingo game, sure, of course
you're right.  That's one of the reasons this list is here for, I guess.
And gender realities sure do impinge on CONVERSATIONS ABOUT poetry here &
everywhere, as do the dulling effects of overposter boys like myself.  Believe
it or not I'm trying to cut down - I abort lotsa posts before sending, you'll
all be glad to know - & hope I don't have to resort to self-inflicted
carpal tunnel syndrom to cut back further. The more people that pipe up
here the better, of all seven genders.  HYEVER I would also respectfully
add that the argument that "I keep quiet because some of those boys might
criticize me" is not a strong argument; moreover, old cartoon reruns of
"what women are like" or "what men are like" don't tell you much about
either poetry or the sex feuds; and finally, to clinch the thing, the
simple truth in a complex world is that my cartoons are just BETTER than
everybody else's cartoons, so there, I win again ha ha ha.

costly clay -
This is a quote from guess who Mandelstam.  I don't have the poem handy,
unfortunately.  Think it was from his trip to Armenia period.  The
"Journey to Armenia" prose piece elaborates a complicated bunch of
metaphorpheenyms around clay, lips, poetry, language, Armenia, time,
and yes - sacrifice.

My God, Thank You, Henry Gould! No more bother about women's
representation in publishing, publications, cartels, circles of power etc.
We just have small ears!  Come to think of it, this notion explains so
much about literary history.  Wasn't it Darwin that first pointed out the
embryonic or "fetal" female ear, only now budding in the twentieth
century? Sorry, twenty-first. I'm Irish, you know, it has always bothered
me a little that the ranting, raging music of my poetry is often heard as
ranting and raging in the U.S., rather than as music.  I thought there
might be a quetion of different ears, and ears being culturally biassed in
some way.  But Henry's post has simplified everything.  What a RELIEF!

In response to the news from Jonesboro, many of us non-USAmericans have

these killings, the one aspect of the situation that has not been
questioned is the lack of any working gun-control laws in the states.

I've got the most giant pair of earrings, Henry.  They're more like
chimes.  They're more like bells on a fire-engine.  They're more like
those honking great bells the hunchback knocked around in Notre Dame.
I'm a-wearing those today.  Or is this too pathetic?  Over-compensation
for my measly small ears?  NO!  Those earrings rock!  Gonna get my tongue
pierced too.  And my nose.  Patrick Kavanagh said SMELL was the most
crucial sense for a poet.  In an "occupation" / "preoccupation" with a
shortage of sense ... words fail me.

Try perusing rec.arts.poems on the Internet.

There, in that newsgroup, you would find many writers, or would-be writers,
sharing their work. I post drafts of my current work there very regularly,
among a large number of some very regular and some irregular contributors.

Many of the poets there use that medium because they either cannot afford
more costly means of publication, or have gotten lost in the nowhere poets'
land of being a nobody as to name recognition when anything lands on any
noteworthy editor's desk, or because they simply do not know what publications
(other than occassional e-zines) to devote their submissive efforts to. It
is not that they suffer from terminal rejection as much as that they have
had no mentors or mentoresses to let them in on anything worthwhile and
the hard line regime of forking out contest entry fees to publications that
prey upon exactly that has dwindled their meagre reserves of means and ways.

Although I have published one self-published book of verse, and been included
in a few obscure local anthologies, I suffer from all of the above maladies,
so I know the syndrome all too well of "make a name for yourself", "make a
success of yourself" and the frequent corollary of "pull yourself up by your
own bootstraps". The latter is indicative as to that genre of dis-encouragement
because if you have ever attempted to pull on your own bootstraps to get
yourself up off the floorboards of any endeavour you know how impossible it
is to do exactly that, and that is in fact the often all too subtle joke in
such exclamations.

The Arkansas event is so extremely irrational, so extremely insane, I suppose
I can find some theoretical, intellectual, explanation for it, but beyond
that I simply cannot comprehend how someone can do that. However, human
history is also largely incomprehenensible, for the same kinds of reasons.

I sometimes think, in an agnostic manner, that if there is a god it has to
have been completely insane to create a universe of the kind it did.
Considering the story has humanity as its supposedly highest pinnacle of
creative effort and that leading to all the endless bloodshed strife that
comprises the macrocosm of political history, and the microcosm of the kind
of lesser bursts of insanity such as the one in Arkansas.

The Cain and Abel story as the archetypal instance in some ways becomes a
dangerously imposed paradigm. Instances that I know of where one brother
is turned to playing Cain and the other must play Abel, but neither would
have otherwise chosen to, in any way, enact the myth. Not every such tragedy
leads to bloodshed, amongst brothers, but such tragedies are many, and some
think it a part of "necessary learning" to re-enact the paradigmatic instance.

Of course those who oppose that most are the non-Marxist anarchists. All
other groups seem to hold to re-enactments of various mythologies, but they
uniquely stand solidly against it and claim it is dysfunctional and a cause
of human suffering. The Buddhists would agree, but modern Buddhists do re-enact.

Armenia, of course, has its extremely bloodied political history.

Much of political history has been brought about by one group seeking to
have additional resources that are controlled by another group, including
the clay,
that in many instances is purely useable space. The other part of political
history is violence utilized as means of conversion purely to push over one
system of ideas onto another. Add to that the foul motives of revenge.
Reminds me of the many non metaphorical roastings, sendings to the flames,
and crowds tearing victims to pieces, that predominated in Europe.
Civilization, such as it is, was sometimes very costly clay indeed, and
those who were not as malleable as moist clay were often eaten alive for
that very "failing". It is a wonder that progress ever occurred in any
liberal and democratic sense of it.

As for myself, I have only been involved, and indirectly, in the spilling
of the blood of violent aggressors, and by fully sanctionned means. Of
course that does not give oneself clean hands. Even that bloodies us. Even
when the aggressors were contemplating genocide, and planning use of weapons
of mass destruction. Mahatma Gandhi would have urged us to sit there and be
blown away by the other side, but that does not seem to be a viable real
world option.

So, in a sense, all of our clay is costlier than you would imagine.
Much, much, costlier than we usually imagine.

Smell?  May be.  Is that why all the really big-eared poets go blind?

We may have to consult some complexity scientists on this issue of the
one and the many, the one big ear and the many different ears.  Especially
when you start to wonder if verbal power is the ultimate form of power
{the Word was God & all that] and poetry is the ultimate expression
of verbal power [in a sealed nutcase], so that Henrygemony is only
one among many expressions of small henrygemonies, and outsiders' demands
to be insiders are demands within a power game, and even outsiders who
claim to have different ears are still trying to catch the attention of
the one big Ear [HCE that is, Ear Comes Everboddy], and every woman and
every man is also everyear every year, everhear that one?  The one about

the most powerful poems show no straining for effect beyond what's
necessary for the complete repeat effect... "power contained"...
"a powerful work"...  "a powerful voice"... "hell of an earful"...
"powerful in its delicacy & restraint"... "powerful cry of the
powerless"... "TOTALLY WINNING lightheartedness & self-mockery"...
"POWERFUL example of selfless impersonality"..."Henry Gould is on a

Sadly, logic dictates that the citizens' right to bear arms is a necessity
to help assure the prevention of the worst kinds of tyranny. As a nation state
becomes ever more centralized and powerful that safeguard sometimes becomes
insidiously undermined and the tendency is to either take away that right
and risk that a dictatorship or an oligarchy might sieze power essentially
unopposed, or for the citizens to seek more powerful means of protecting
their freedoms.

The question becomes how to prevent casualties and protect those very freedoms
that are vouchsafed against the rising up of a dictator, a Hitler or a
Stalin, at the head of the machinations of power ?  Perhaps the failing is
in education
and in the what and how of it.

There is no easy answer.

Would sufficient force of arms in the control of the citizens have prevented
the Third Reich and its reign of terror and bloodshed ?  Perhaps.

Would sufficient force of arms in the control of the citizens have prevented
the Stalinist reign of terror and its bloodshed of many millions more lives,
as well as the total enslavement of countless millions of others ?  Probably.

If anyone has a better answer than the citizens right to bear arms, to the
problem of totalistic tyranny and the evils and sufferings wraught by
some kinds of political dictatorships, please do share it. I doubt anyone can
offer even one iota of alternative, practical, real world wisdom.

As to what is taught to children, to form their values and to further their
understanding, self control, sense of ethics, and to alleviate some of the
horrible conflicts and prejudices that are rife within North America, that
is a very different matter....Perhaps that is the really significant question.

I agree that there's a hell of a lot more to poetry than gender and I agree
that "boys criticize me" isn't a good argument not to speak (tho' I've fallen
prey to it on occasion).  However, a couple of things occur to me:

1. Poetry isn't just about listening.  I can hear Moby Dick all I want, but
it is my response to it that makes poetry a dialetical function.   Action, be
it in discussing Moby Dick or writing something about it, or performing
something you've written, is, often beyond any one person's desires, gendered
(tho' I'm certainly not arguing that this gendering is in any way natural or
cannot be manipulated)

2. Boys (and girls and others) criticize, and often it's helpful, even if
occasionally not ego-gratifying.  However, I've often had the experience of
suspecting that a criticism made of my work (either in tone or content) was
specifically based in gender (like suspecting that he's majorly invested in
proving his manhood more than discussing work with me) and getting that
shocked look when I suggested maybe this was the case.  Because, what,
gender's a chick thing?  I know some of my own criticisms have been
questionable in similar ways (on days when I'm tired or mad, not taking a
male student's Mack Bolan-type poems as seriously as I might {odd how I
picked an example with a guy who would have less instituational power than I,
says something, I think} or getting unneccisarily angry at fellow female
poets writing "daddy" poems because I'm worried that they are repeating
female "poetess" stereotypes).  Dumb (and unfair), right?  But the thing is,
criticism's can be critiqued.  If you suspect that the criticism you are
going to get is not valid to your work, why put your work out there?

So what now?  I don't know that anyone is suggesting that men "play nice"
with women writers and not criticize them.  I think it's a little simplistic
to think that all the posts written about why women don't post or submit as
frequently as men boil down to "women are scared of criticism."

I wonder, if women and other genders who historically have been marginalized
were to contribute more to mags and listservs, would gender stop being an
"issue" in poetry communities?  Perhaps new gender "issues" would arise, but
what might they look like?  taste like?

Oh yeah, I like Aldon's post very much.

the one aspect of the situation that has not been
questioned is the lack of any working gun-control laws in the states.



yes, I found this startling, it's as if: "the root of the problem isn't
guns, it's [single parent families][tv shows][cigarettes][the middle
east], and if there were no guns, HELL, those kids would have thrown
PEBBLES, or cried out ABUSE, or squirted their victims with WATER PISTOLS.
Different versions of the same problem"  I remember when a man burst into
a primary school in Scotland (in Dunblaine, I think) and shot several
children - the FIRST reaction was a chorus of anti-gun protest, now all
guns are banned in the UK (amnesty for licence holders)

this situation will never change in the US, right?

Eye dunno if the verbal is the _ultimate_ form of power if speech is
act (as the theory may go) but words are powerful yes indeed they make
worlds

as hannah weiner said, I see words
as eye say, eye c wor(l)ds

but eye also 'ear them too

and words impinge on the body at least mine and eye agree with olga
broumas who once said poetry can bee like el-ess-dee  it has a strong
kick and changes the way one can c the wor(l)d

it runs through my blood and the clay of which eye am made and mixes
with the blood of the ones who are gone who are within me as much as in
the clod next to my foot and it overpowers me and overwhelms me and
changes me as much as eye wheeled it

so eye make wor(l)ds too and they are as true as anything else out
there.

(i mean -really-, mind) BELIEVE THAT A BUNCH OF FARMERS SCHOOLBOYS AND
INSURANCE SALESMEN, JUST BY 'VIRTUE' OF POSSESSING A HANDGUN EACH, COULD
OPPOSE THE U.S. ARMED FORCES?!! What a load of shit!  As for the Third
Reich - what do you KNOW about this?  The Nazis were elected both by the
citizens of Germany in a democratic process and by the president of the
Reichstag; most people would not even have cocked their pistols had they
owned any; small pockets of armed resistance (eg anti Hitlerjugend
splinter groups of young men such as the Edelweiss Pirates) were
negligible in effect and of primarily symbolic importance; the Polish
army, a trained body of fighting professionals with military equipment,
could not prevent their country being annexed, so how the hell do you
imagine a citizenry - impressed with their government and swarming to meet
Hitler whenever he passed through their towns with near-hysteric
jubiliation, faced with the combined military and paramilitary might of
the SS, SA and German armed forces proper - could EVER have prevented
(what I suppose you're driving at) the holocaust, OR even have wished to
do so, OR EVEN (and here's a nice rub re: the US) HAVE KNOWN ABOUT IT
(most people had no clue).

It seems as if the discussion about gender kind of dwindled away--

I was slightly disappointed with the manner in which it devolved into
witticism--

My original post--re: women submitting and participating was not about
women's poetry per se--as poetry--but rather about the production of
literature--the barriers that must be surmounted before a single person
can manage to put pen to paper; and how these barriers seem to be higher
for women.

I haven't managed to be articulate about this distinction, I don't think,
so thought I'd post an excerpt from Woolf's Room of One's Own. This
excerpt is taken from a wonderful and absolutely necessary book--FEMINISM:
THE ESSENTIAL HISTORICAL WRITINGS.(Vintage, 1972).

If you haven't read these articles--by minds such as Abigail Adams, Mary
Wollstonecraft, George Sand, Sojourner Truth, John Stuart Mill, Emma
Goldman, and so on--it's as if you hadn't read Marx--

And if you want to talk about class, you might do well to read a little
Marx, no?--

The following is one of the most basic of feminist arguments:

But you may say, we asked you to speak about women and fiction--what has
that got to do with a room of one's own? I will try to explain. When you
asked me to speak about women in fiction I sat down on the banks of the
river and began to wonder what the words meant. They might mean simply a
few remarks about Fanny Burney; a few more about Jane Austen; a tribute to
the Brontes and a sketch of Haworth Parsonage under snow; some witticisms
if possible about Miss Mitford; a respectful allusion to George Eliot; a
reference to Mrs. Gaskell and one would have done. But at second sight the
words seemed not so simple. The title women and fiction might mean, and
you may have meant it to mean, women and what they are like; or it might
mean women and the fiction that is written about them; or it might mean
that somehow all three are inextricably mixed together and you want me to
consider them in that light. But when I began to consider the subject in
this last way, which seemed most interesting, I soon saw that it had one
fatal drawback. I should never be able to come to a conclusion...

...All I could do was to offer you an opinion upon one minor point--a
woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction;
and that, as you will see, leaves the great problem of the true nature of
woman and the true nature of fiction unsolved. I have shirked the duty
of coming to a conclusion upon these two questions--women and fiction
remain, so far as I'm concerned, unsolved problems. But in order to make
some amends I am going to do what I can to show you how I arrived at this
opinion about the room and the money...

...Life for both sexes--and I looked at them [through a restaurant window
while waiting for my lunch to be served], shouldering their way along the
pavement--is arduous, difficult, a perpetual struggle. It calls for
gigantic courage and strength. More than anything, perhaps, creatures of
illusion as we are, it calls for confidence in oneself. Without
self-confidence we are as babes in the cradle. And how can we generate
this imponderable quality, which is yet so invaluable, most quickly? By
thinking that other people are inferior to oneself. By feeling that one
has some innate superiority--it may be wealth, rank, or a straight nose,
or the portrait of a grandfather by Romney--for there is no end to the
pathetic devices of the human imagination--over other people. Hence the
enourmous importance to a patriarch who has to conquer, who has to rule,
of feeling that great numbers of people, half the human race indeed, are
by nature inferior to himself. It must indeed be one of the chief sources
of his power.... Women have served all these centuries as looking glasses
ppossessing the magic and delicious power fo reflecting the figure of the
man twice its natural size.

It is very much like a desert, if it could be

It is remote, even under your fingers, gentle ridges here and there.
It doesn't know whether it has a heart or not

It has already fallen silent.
It is only if a storm could rage in marble
It is if it were to die it would.
It is a matter of its own indifference.

According to studies by Deborah Tannen, author of _He Said, She Said_ , women
and men learn strikingly different modes of discourse from an early age.  Most
boys learn to use conversation as a competitive activity, emphasizing their
differences and individuality, establishing a hierarchy, which contributes to
group cohesion, and within which each member is constantly striving for a
higher position by challenging others and by showing his own knowledge to be
"superior."  Most girls learn to use conversation among friends as a
cooperative activity. Anyone who criticizes within the group, or tries to show
superior knowledge is setting herself apart from (above) the group, and is
therefore seen as making an attempt to destabilize it. Differences of opinion
are more often put forward as questions rather than statements. Or they're
prefaced with phrases such as, "In my experience," implying respect for the
speaker's opinion while maintaining one's own. Within the cooperative mode of
discourse, a direct statement of "you're wrong" is, in effect, telling the
speaker to shut up.

So, when folks using the two different modes of discourse, the competitive and
the cooperative, come together, the competitors tend to dominate because their
direct challenges and criticisms are, within the rules of cooperative
discourse, telling the cooperatives that their contributions are unacceptable.
This affects discussions of poetics, because academic discourse generally
utilizes the competitive mode. And, while young women are now more often
trained to use the competitive mode with confidence, saying that women
"should" do this is really saying that women should be more like men. Until
both sides recoginize these different modes of discourse, respect them
equally, and take them into account in their conversations together, women
will often think that men are (verbally) attacking them, and men will think
the women are wimping out.

This is just a very brief, and probably inadequate, summary of some of the
main points in Tannen's book, which I highly recommend to anyone interested in
this subject.

Since Linda Reinfeld posted a query for Toshi Ishihara, it reminded me to
recommend their wonderful 1996 collaborative translation "The Game of 100
Poems": a set of 200 cards that together make up the 100 poems of Hyakunin
Isshu, based on the anthology of 100 tanka poems (5-7-5, 7-7) compiled by
Sadaie Fujiwara in 1235). This version consists of 100 cards with the first
line and 100 cards with the second line, which you can match up in a
variety of ways. In the introduction Ishihara and Reinfeld note that
"Although this anthology has frequently been translated into English, our
translation is unique, for we have chosen to use couplets, rather than free
verse of syllabic form, to reflect the two-part structure of the poems".

I hope that copies of this remarkable box of poems are still available; if
interested, write to Linda Reinfeld: lreinfeld@MONROECC.EDU.

Grand Empress's Household, in reaction to the events in Jonesboro:

it was very confusing for me to be raised with the "male" rules for
conversation and then enter the social world. my main problem was not other
women but guys, who recoiled from my "unfeminine" and combattive verbal
style.  i couldn't figure out what the problem was.  now that i'm
thoroughly therapized and midwesternized, i've learned to adopt some
"feminine" conversational" skills and i must say it's helped a lot, not w/
getting guys so much as with just getting along better in society.

One of the things I'm curious about is what men think about their own gender
when writing/ publishing/ reading/ discussing poetry?  Do you think about
gender at times like this?  Given the original question: why are women often
reluctant to contribute, it seems logical to ask: why are men likely to do
so?  I think we know some of the historical/social reasons:  access to money,
old boy networks, all that Jungian " spiritual wise man," ah, stuff, etc. --
but what else?  If you want to avoid this stuff (or things like class and
race keeps you away from money, networks, etc) what makes you contribute?

Do you feel this big imperative to write based on notions you would consider
gendered?  If not, why?

I mean, sure, I write for a lot of reasons, some not "gendered", but I feel
the call of ole' Virginia Woolf to find my own room.   Certainly, hashing out
my gender has been a big deal in my writing.  Is this just a chick thing?

I don't mean to deter from the original question (because I think it's
important) Katy posed and I certainly don't want to turn this into an "us
gals" and "you guys" kind of debate, but, for the sake of discussion, maybe
we could ask a series of different questions re: gender that might be
enlightening.  I got the impression people were into this debate and it sort
of died.

--oh, and Katy, someone had said your mag isn't currently taking
contributions.  Is it true?   When will your mag be ready for lots of rock-
and-roll poetry/prose by women? (I bet others will be interested)

Another interesting post from Bobbie. But you know what? It's difficult for
me to recognize and accord equal respect to both the modes she describes,
as she, generously, advocates. I dislike intensely the male model, regret
the times I may have followed it, and would very much like to see it
abandoned. I hope the definiteness of tone in that previous sentence isnt a
hangover from my training as a male? I've enjoyed hearing women be just
that clear. And please--I know I'm an ironist, but no irony intened here.

        Having written and published a few pieces drawn from real life
experiences of shootings and killings--i.e. happened in my life to people
I knew as well as to me--
        it is not bemusing to regard the killings--they are part of a long
tradition in American life (and art, to be sure)--
        it's easy to say it's just guns--but the hells many endure living
in the usa go beyond simple violence--(remember:  Thoreau spoke of "lives
of quiet desperation" lived in silence--violence is what happens when
silence
becomes too much to endure, when one does know how to speak, or if anyone
will listen--)
        one of the great moralists of our times, one William S. Burroughs,
has an exceptional passage in Maked Lunch--an out pouring of outrage at
the
spirit of evil which haunts the land--
        millions were killed in this country without guns--drugs, alcohol,
toxic waste dumps, no access to health care, locked up in reservations,
beaten and starved, tortured, lynched, malnutrition, chemical and nuclear
experiments, medical and biological experiments--
        many of my ancestors were killed by a simple method:  they were
given disease infected blankets when shipped off their homelands by the us
govt.
        there are many interesting studies tracing the origins of this
violence to Puritanism--you can find the flip side of this in some of Jim
Thompson's novels--
        but the desire for purification, and to purge the world of
impurities--
        to know grace (and when you can't be rewarded with riches--why not
with power--over another's life--)--
        Remember Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver:  "all my life I've known
loneliness--in cars, on sidewlaks--in bars--loneliness has followed me
everywhere--I'm God's lonely man--"
         . . ."Someday a real rain will come . . . "
         . . ."You talkin' to me?--Huh?--Then who the f*** are you talkin
to?"
        When it's not such a short step from a desire to overcome
intolerable life, or solitude, or silence to being God's lonely man--
        is not this the mission of the righteous?
        "Huh?"

In talking about the constitutional right to bear arms it helps to go back
to the thinking of the founders. While the amendment guarantees the right
to bear arms in order to facilitate the maintenance of a militia (as
opposed to a standing army), the jeffersonians certainly had the resistance
to tyranny in mind, as well. So citizens could keep their guns, which gave
them a fire-power only marginally inferior to the military, which weilded
at best uncertain artillery.
By that logic the right to bear arms should include the right to private
ownership of, say, supersonic jets armed with everything but nuclear
weapons. As this is impractical, not least because if large numbers of us
owned our own military aircraft every flat surface on the continent would
have to be paved for private airfields, the right to bear arms has become
obsolete, and stricter weapons control makes sense.
On the other hand, there's no practical reason why the citizenry couldn't
be armed with chemical and biological weapons, which can be stored easily
(a good refrigerator does wonders for most biological weapons, except when
there's a power failure). At the very least apartment living could become a
lot more interesting.

This is a very fruitful line of discussion, I think.  I haven't, myself, read the
Tannen book, but I've come to similar observations via other writers, Carol
Gilligan and Nancy Chodorow and Riane Eisler, for example.  I firmly believe that
distinctions between "the Competitive" male models and "the cooperative" female
models of discourse/language use
and engagement/writing/poetics etc are going to yield exceptionally "new" poetries
and
world.  (Also, I do not think these kinds of considerations have been "done" by
even the most innovative of "reader-based" poets, though I think some (no, I'm not
going to mention any names) may have taken, inadvertently, steps in such
directions.)
        The key issue here is, as Eisler would argue in _The Chalice & The Blade_,
the distinction between "competitive" and "cooperative" models, the former having
dominated a good deal of, if not most of, all cultures since about 10,000 years
ago.  Let me leave this little diatribe at this for now, but add one more silly
obsession of mine: What happens to "competition" if poetries are produced
"anonymously."  Do the ballfields get leveled?
Do even well known poets gain freedom to "make it new," i.e., create something
many folks would dig yet not be able to label as XX's or XY's poetry?

Women feel threatened by men; men feel threatened by ideas.
Women feel threatened by men; men feel threatened by their own shadows.
Gender is an idea women can identify with; for men, ideas are sexualized.
For women, gender is something to write about; for men, writing IS their
gender (i.e. they take it for granted).
The world cultural structure is the result of men subjecting the world
to their shadows.  Women are strange attractors in that shadow game.

Slightly off topic, but. . .

I also find these studies compelling.  Except when I start thinking about
pedagogy.  Have studies been done on communication patterns of women who have
positions of institutional power, like, say, that of a teacher?  I've read a
great number of essays by feminist comp. professors (and heard them speak)
and often the most horrible issues they dealt with in essays/talks are  the
insolent male student who won't cooperate with their feminist pedagogies.
While I suspect many can sympathize, I found that usually by the end of these
essays/talks, it all seemed to come down to finding ways to make them behave,
usually through the mighty grading pen.  I know, I know, I should offer proof
of this-- I recall one in Lad Tobin's _Taking Stock_ which troubled me.  So
what does this mean?  Are cooperative ways of speaking (and teaching) always
cooperative?

Do the studies of "gender speak" tend to naturalize gender in a way which is
always useful?  As a female teacher, I think the idea of "gendered
pedagogies" need to be rigorously thought out.

Jane Gallop's essay "Teacher's Breasts" was sort of instructive to me in this
vein, tho' I sometimes have problems with Gallop.  But, performative pedagogy-
- does it offer extra-gendered (not quite sure what that means, but sounds
kind of X-filesy) teaching possiblities?  Do we need them?

Going on vacation,
Elizabeth

I can't speak to these well-known studies except anecdotally, and as a
member of a fractious family raised in fractious New York I have little
experience of this gendered difference in conversation styles. But I am
willing to accept the general acuracy of the findings, and here in San
Diego I had expected experience to conform more closely to the model.
So here's a recent experience.
I just finished jury duty. A forty-year-old single woman claimed, and the
court in a previous case had confirmed, that a prospective boss, who was
holding out the possibility of a lucrative job that apparently didn't
exist, had driven the woman from a business dinner (or so she had
understood it) to a secluded area, instead of to her car, as he had
proposed, where he proceeded to lose it in a big way, becoming verbally and
gesturally violent to the point that she feared for her life and also
feared that she would be raped. On the stand, when asked what her thoughts
had been, she said that a multitude of thoughts had occured to her during
the three or four minutes in question, including the aforesaid, and also
that fleeing in high heels on wet, stony ground would be difficult, and
that she would ruin her suit.
This is only a piece of a wider case, but it's emblematic of the whole. We
were supposed to determine, among other things, if the woman had
experienced recompensable damage, and how much, due to emotional stress and
fear at that moment.
The jury consisted of two men, myself and a working class guy of maybe 28,
one woman in her 70's, and nine married working women of various social
classes between 25 and 45. All were white, none hispanic. Except for me and
the older woman, all were native to the area. Us guys and the older woman
were the only ones who voted for damages (or lost wages, the other matter
in contention). The other nine thought that she must be lying about her
fears, or she wouldn't have worried about her suit (in refusing to award
lost wages the nine held that the woman should have known better, she was
probably trying to use her feminine wiles, and she was a spoiled bitch
anyway).
The nine appeared for the most part to be motivated by distrust of single
women and envy of their social mobility, although a few did raise some
interesting points.
All of the women participated vociferously, interrupting and drowning out
opposition in a manner that would have provoked admiration even among the
women of my own family.
At one point towards the end I found myself, in frustration, telling the
women that I must be the only feminist there. I instantly realized that I
had just become a cliche, and that I was probably right. This is San Diego.
After that experience I'd love to meet some women who consider conversation
a cooperative activity.

That is not logic. That is USAmerican brainwashing. The citizens dont bear
arms in most peaceful democratic societies. They are more likely to be
bearing arms in countries in which oligarchies persist. There are more
Serbians carrying weopans than there are New Zealanders carrying weapons.

What do men think of their gender when in conversation, with women, with
men, with students?
What do men think/feel about gender when the write poems, post to the
list etc ...
What do men think feel about gender (their gender) when they reflect on
Jonesboro?

John Berger, ages ago, wrote something to the effect "men act, women
appear" and probably this could be paraphrased to make the general case
"men act without reflection on their gender; woman appear always as
gendered...."

I read Girls on Film and Postfeminist Playground here on the net, among
other gendered sites, and I read this list and I am teaching Ceremony
now by Leslie Marmonm Silko and I looked at my mom's RedBook and my
sister's Seventeen when I was growing up. I will buy Cosmo occasionally
now and discuss the images and the advice with my students who are
reading Berger. What does all this have in common, high brow or low
brow, the women are telling stories that have somekind of healing power
for them. I do not find men telling me stories with healing power.
Instead I hear men citing the law.

I badly need a story with healing power to help me comprehend Jonesboro.
I want the stories of all those involved, the boys, the friends of the
victims, the parents. I think Silko is right the world is fragile and it
needs our stories. How did I come to think this way? I think class has
more to do with it in my case than gender. I have always been aware that
boys of my class are not supposed to have the interests that I have. I
have had this feeling when talking with boys and men of more privileged
backgrounds than mine. I have pursed obscurity in defiance of a fear of
failure. I have flaunted my talents and I have failed miserably because
it was expected. I have often been embarassed by my claims that I had
something special to offer someone. Now I have an ear and an intellect,
but I still do not have a story.

I think gender is a story that helps women negotiate reality.
I think class is a story that helps me negotiate reality.
I think this country has produced a maximum of human misery and
suffering.
When I think of men with respect to gender, I loathe what I see. I see
men eating their children and killing one another. I am appalled that
boys have taken to gunning down girls in Jonesboro and in Paducah.

And I ask does my attempt to make sense of any of this reflect the
privelege of my gendered position?  I hope not--but I see my post can be
read as plea by one representative male for women to save him and that
too is an old and tedious story--but I do love the weaving of voices
around me. I have been listending to Gesualdo and Hildegaard von Bingen
and it almost doesn't matter what they say anymore, because of weaving
and that is what I am seeing again in Silko's Ceremony and what I have
geard in Woolf's Room and something that is so difficult for both my
male and my female students to grasp.

Sorry to be so open-ended and unresolved ... My question comcerns the
passion for words in resonant structures, the ears, and the relation of
this passion to the need for healing stories.

If I remember correctly--

One of the threads that preceded this one had to do with some people
signing off? And these people (person) had said something about
intellectual smugness on the list--professorial/padagogical tones being
dominant--

I at least partially agreed with this person--

But also figured that the list had more to offer.

I like it that the posts lately have consisted of so many
stories--especially stories that seem to relate to the composition of
poetry--to the process by which people here write--and their reasons for
writing.

I know that I write (and edit and poeticize) for reasons not altogether
clear to me.

I can sometimes pin-point the sensation that prompts me to write--

Sometimes it consists of anxiety related to my gender, my age, my day--to
things that someone else has said--

Sometimes it consists of a feeling of elation--of, perhaps, a kind of
manic response to something provocative that I encounter--a person, a
phrase, a picture.

But sometimes I'm not really sure what it is--

Part of why I like the idea of this list is that it makes people from
lots of backgrounds available to me. I like it when people post little
reports about their day--maybe regarding a reading they went to the night
before.

I like it when Keston and others post poems.

I like to hear about people's histories as writers--why they write.

That's it.

Hi--

Just received a wonderful batch of poems from one of my favorite
poets--Ishmael Klein.

She is from New York--doesn't publish much (I don't think she sends out)--

I am including her work in the next issue of Explosive. The issue has a
theme--"Spectacular Emotion."

Ishmael is an incredibly unique writer. She reads a lot of old stuff--


EACH DAY DIFFERENT ENOUGH TO BE SOMETHING SUN CAN SET ON

These crows we see manifest ill crowd mentality.
If their going off in pairs is as mate, does it as love redeem?
I'm afraid no. This tree too unhappy full of messy noise i.e. crows.

When a dead man dries his soul gets to go
with wind. Hawks come in
against crows in wheeling tournament for soul.

If the black birds get it, they celebrate in a tree
to scare it, living, under them. No moonlight gets past them;
much less a helpful sparrow. Trees only love unambitious birds.

If hawk, talons out to prize...
If hawk wins, soul goes higher privately.
Dust souls have nothing to say about it.

They only want enough weight to be worth effort.

I see today getting dark. Villagers walk home quick
according to the state of the sky. They urge each other
in as well I'd want myself in general.

This world large insofar as has
big grasp to take the unattached away
which attracts certain animals.

Maybe you think this emphasis of hypothetical phenomenon
with questionable qualities just as well not there.
But you said "Big World" yourself and not without the look of imminent
        icebath

I've told those turned cold to go.
I want to stay myself but more informed.
I want the animals to like me.

Apologies in advance for the anecdotal nature of what follows. Please
consider this is a Product Warning.

Thank you Mark Weiss, for your anecdote, the timely reminder that the map
is not always the territory. What a horror story! Your patience wit and
irony notwithstanding, you must have been sorely tried. I myself was this
week at a meeting where one woman was shouting down another. I must have
blotted it out when I posted the other day. I guess I've been "spoiled" by
the company I keep professionally, by its articulateness, and its
self-injunction to question its own motives--although there have been some
verbal brawls at dept meetings where gender would scarcely have been
discernible to one reading a transcript which rendered the speakers
anonymous. I suppose I seek out people of either gender who enjoy
conjecture and entertain many viewpoints; and intuitively avoid
"overriders" bent on laying down the law. Not that I havent laid it down in
my time.

And not to say my wife and I wont fight like cat and dog upon sufficient
provocation--whatever may constitute that next time. (It's the !surprise!
that trashes civility.) Then there's our 16-y-o daughter, who says a lot
with a door.
And I've had some horrible arguments with people that when I look back on
are like lenses that focus and enlarge my pigheadedness & spite. Nor did
they, man or woman, fight fair. Still I like to think there is something to
the broad generalities of these gender-speak theories, and my tendency to
align with what they say are women's ways.

As an admirer and student (in the large sense) of Robert Duncan, I thought
often about the idea of Strife as the mainspring of the human universe.
"Why was he so spiteful towards the Langpos," I would ask myself, "When
opposition and difference were what he was looking for? Where was his
gratitude for their proving something he felt so opposite? " In short, the
notion of Strife as the generative force of existence contains its own
undoing, IMHO, since one must welcome what one detests, for proving one's
belief right. Only those who hold with Agreement as the mainspring can
properly reject the disagreeable, if it prove incorrigible, that is, if it
persist in its folly despite all of one's attempts to enlighten it--to
strive with it. Or so it appears to me. db3.

Thanks to Charles Bernstein's generous notice, there's
revived interest in our translation of Hyakunin Isshu:
The Game of 100 Poems. We're selling them for $21.00 a
box (that includes the cost of mailing in the USA): there
are not many left, so if you want me to save you a set,
please let me know by email ASAP.

Our translation is now available in book form as well.
Kansai University Press published it last year, a very
nicely done bilingual edition, hardback, with some of
our own photographs. I have plenty of copies of that, and
there are who knows how many more "sleeping in Japan,"
according to Toshi. You can order it from me for $11.00
(again, cost of mailing included).

Cash or checks made out to me, Linda Reinfeld,

I want to second this, Mark. The plaintiff tells what ran through her mind,
& her thoughts are found illogical, or inadequate or something, as though
minds worked that way in tense moments. I'm not even sure it was
illogical--clearly she'd need that suit in good shape to search for a new
job!

And thanks David, too. Some good stuff coming out of these discussions.
Isn't this, from your last post, why we were attracted to reading/writing
poetry in the first place?

good point on Duncan too. It's the paradox of revolutionaries who win &

K. Lederer thank you for putting us on track again.  I am not generally the
confessional type but would like to put my personal experience out there for
comment.

I left the United States with my family as a child just eight years old.
I've been writing words to please myself since that time.  They were secret
words in special worlds which accompanied me as we moved and moved and
moved.  I never thought of myself as a writer, but rather, a passionate
traveler who liked to write.

One day, twenty years later, I decided to stop traveling.  I built myself a
home and surrounded it with a garden.  I didn't get on an airplane for over
ten years.   Raising three children doesn't give you alot of choice about
time to write; I wrote at midnight, at six in the morning, whenever I could,
whenever I wasn't working or reading.

One day, I looked at a corner of my garden and said to myself, I'm going to
write over there.  I was determined to have a room of my own.  With the
little bit of money I'd saved I bought an old house, hired some carpenters
and built me a room.  My Thai mother-in-law was worried.  Are you leaving
us?  My children were worried.  Are you going to live in it?  My husband
said nothing, I told him nothing.  I realized that not one of them knew that
I was going to write in that room.  In fact, none of them thought anything
about the writing they had witnessed for years.

But now that I go to my room every day, the kids tell visitors:  Mommy's
over there, she's writing.  My mother-in-law comes up every now and then to
talk and excuses herself for disturbing my writing.  My friends ask, what
are you writing?

I write because I can't imagine what to do with what I think, other than
writing it in words on a piece of paper.  That's where it still happens,
despite the screen in front on me.  I have been alone with this writing for
so long in a place where no one can read my language that I can't imagine
what it would mean to someone else.   For me it's a part of life that needs
it's own space just like my children or my dinner or my bath.  Inviting
someone to read it would be like asking them to share a meal or a shower.
It would be like taking my children for an interview: if there was a good
reason, I'd do it, but, I'd be pretty careful.

By "worst kind of tyranny" I wonder if you meant any of the following:

-the tyranny of right wing militant organizations
-the tyranny of spouse abusing husbands
-the tyranny of armed youth gangs

I could go on... but I'll finish on this one: the tyranny of an outdated

Gimme a break. The "right to bear arms" will never stand in the way of the
U.S. military, but it does make life miserable and sometimes shattering for
countless innocents.

Thank you to everyone who has sent letters of support on behalf of the
Kootenay School of Writing. The Cultural Affairs staff at the City of
Vancouver are still telling us that they will not restore our funding but
have indicated they are upset by the letters being sent to the mayor and
city councillors (who have final approval of our appeal). This is a good
indication the letters are having an effect. We are urging people to
continue to send letters. The appeal will be heard by city council on April
23rd so please send letters, emails, faxes before that date.


Some background info:

The Kootenay School of Writing is a volunteer collective which organizes
reading, lectures and workshops in Vancouver, BC. KSW has been operating
since 1984 and published Writing magazine until 1992 and now publish Raddle
Moon. For the last 12 years KSW has enjoyed the financial support of the
City of Vancouver. Now, without any prior indication, the city has decided
that our audience and scope are too limited to warrant funding. Our
financial request is relatively small ($4000) but without it KSW may have to
close or at the very least severely curtail our activities.

I shall answer this one, as it resembles some of the other contentions, and
I do not want to take too much bandwidth on this poetics channel as regards
what is mostly political content. Not that the two subjects are wholly
separable. Poetics and politics, poeticians and politicians, are
inextricably interwoven into a similar niche in the same fabric... (Ginsberg
and Nixon, for example, such that we have to wonder sometimes who influenced
peace in southeast Asia more strongly, the poetician or the politician, both
playing their parts).

>By "worst kind of tyranny" I wonder if you meant any of the following:

>-the tyranny of right wing militant organizations

The power of persuasive salesmanship could result in a illigitimate
usurpation of power. That certainly is a concern.

>-the tyranny of spouse abusing husbands

I do not doubt there are spouse abusing wives also, but in any instance,
at least individuals in those situations can leave those situations as
a matter of freedom of choice. I know that I would never remain within a
truly abusive relationship, and feel bound to be the martyred victim.
Probably because I despise sado-masochism, having no liking for pain, and
even less liking for any others being deliberately afflicted with pain.
Least of all when someone doing the afflicting is _enjoying_ doing so.

I think that there are at least as many sadistic women as there are sadistic
men, who enjoy causing pain to some other and cause such pain intentionally.

Fortunately humanity as a whole is not by its nature that way. It is simply
that some people are that way.

>-the tyranny of armed youth gangs

The fact that those exist is a question concerning education and its efficacy.

Of course, such need to be disarmed, demobilized, and demilitarized, don't
they ?  The world has shown, on occassion, that it knows how to accomplish
such tasks, and I see no real difference in that regard between adult armies
of aggression and armies of youths, commanded similarly, and armed to the
teeth along with aggressive, territorial, violent intentions. I am not
suggesting as violent a response as their's to each other, as might cause
loss of life, as that is certainly not what is desired, but in psychological
terms at least the two situations can be all too similar.

Gangs of youths need peacekeeping forces as much as countries and ethnic
groups that are hell bent on destroying, conquering, and otherwise
violencing and brutalizing each other. Gangs often have their own unique
ideologies and ritual practices. They identify with each other internally
and dehumanize outsiders (from other gangs, mostly), so that it is easier
for members to make war on the aliens. The best method has proven to be
demilitarization and at minimum a greater force of arms to cause a standing
down of the aggressors. With armies hell bent on destroying other armies
that they see in conflict with them, there seems to be no other way.
Diplomacy usually becomes no more than a military tactic to allow regrouping
and escalation of firepower.

All ideologies, as such, are exactly as you say. I would never argue with
anyone who is saying that all ideologies, religious and political, are
essentially dysfunctional in light of their very natures as ideology.

They are beliefs that disregard the realities and fail to respond to the
realities as an inevitable consequence of that fact.

As for the machinations of 20th century conflict, including such instances
as German and Italian electronic inventiveness, and the attempts of all
sides to manipulate the figure head leader Hitler's psyche by remote
means... the historians have not yet even begun to unravel this century. The
wizards of oz have been around, and active, since the previous and it will a
long while until that curtain is parted. They keep writing much the same
fictions, and yet most of political history is fictional. We are even
further from a good account of what medeival times were like in Europe.
There is such a tendency to stress civilization, and such a reluctance to
realize how much worse than Machiavellian it all really is. So tell me about
this beleaguered century. We can only weep for what it was and has become,
in terms of the tolls exacted as to human suffering, including the silent
sufferings of the brain washed and the unknown countless victims of
political/ideological torture.

There is a very real question as to who is doing it to whom, in such
political arenas. Each aggressor group wants the others all to think it is
someone else other than themselves, so you are dealing with a web of
chamelion trickery of a very sophisticated kind. The KGB liked to pretend it
was the CIA doing it to Americans, and were quite good at that. They fooled
a lot of people.

It is much worse than you think it is.

>Gimme a break. The "right to bear arms" will never stand in the way of the
>U.S. military, but it does make life miserable and sometimes shattering for
>countless innocents.

Soldiers are more likely to be split into factions and to turn on their own,
if they are ordered to kill their neighbours, friends, even families. At
least if they are put up against the very people they continue to partly
identify with as "their own" according to national, cultural, and other
factors of identity. Even sporadic guerrilla action against a military coup
can lead to its overthrow by splitting the military forces involved as truly
oppressive tyranny is not likely
to have complete and total loyalty in any instance. What would spur such a
split is armed resistance among the population. One has a harder time
shooting one's friends than one has shooting the dehumanized enemy. It is
much harder to dehumanize the citizenry of one's own country, to turn its
army against its own people.

So it is far from as simple as you seem to suggest.

There are safeguards within the right to bear arms, and as you say there are
risks and dangers. I hate the thought of the latter happening, as much as
you do, and there ought to be better ways to address the question
effectively, such as teaching responsibility at an early age and
facilitating effective communication and non violent conflict resolution
from an early age, as well as some respect for the well being and lives of
others, without taking away the right of adult citizens to bear arms.

Of course the right to bear arms ought to hinge upon some controls that
regulate who can and who cannot obtain a permit. There are some people who
ought not to have them, as they would predictably use them for evil and
nefarious purposes, rather than the reasonable defense against illigitimate
usurpations of power.

The worst, most oppressive, tyranny would result where there is zero
probability of resistance to that tyranny. In fact it would be inevitable
and absolute.

Wonderful story. I, too, love the personal, but always wonder if it's
"appropriate" to the list. I like to think so, but what do you, fellow listees,
think? Is there a line where something is too personal for the list?

This actually raises interesting questions about where life & poetry meet &
mingle. In undergrad (visual art) I recall a consensus among my peers that
sculpture shouldn't be "too personal," (this in the midst of
minimalism/post-minimalism). And if someone, during a critique, didn't want to
explain their work, inevitably they'd say: "I don't want to say any more--it's
personal."

My Mom always said: "Don't write down anything you don't want EVERYONE to see."
She also said, when I wasn't being "good,": "Why don't you understand
English?!?" Perhaps the harmless remarks of an immigrant-child turned school
teacher, but it's always made every word that comes out of my mouth or off of my
page seem dangerous/embarrassing/too personal. And now email & lists tempt  me
to write down things on the fly, which everyone will see. My Mom'd be horrified!

Viva la personal!

I'm surprised: usually you're more humane. I don't understand the workings of
relationships where women get stuck in abusive relationships, but it's been
pointed out time & again by shrinks & the women alike that walking away does not
present itself as a choice. It's the torturer-victim bond, well-documented, the
usual phrase for which I can't recall first thing in the morning.

One of the most delicious things in writing, I find, is the juxtaposition of
abstraction and personal revelation.  One fulls the other forward.

Sometimes it is appealing to note that someone made you want him/her to go

I imagine that anyone else who managed to read to the end of morpheal's
rejoinder will be, as I am, surprised at that feat; rarely (yes, rarely,
despite the various urge to pessimism) do we get to see so accidentally
inflammatory a note, such coarse and reckless improvising about real
suffering, such a vacuous and automatic defense: "our vanity is never
harder to damage than immediately after our pride has been damaged", etc.
I disagree with every amateurish appeal and clownish assurance he makes
("it's more XXX than YOU know"), with a vehemence teetering on contempt,
NO - fuck it - with CONTEMPT, but the recital of one passage should
suffice to illuminate his obnoxiousness (not that this passage is even
the most obnoxious - just recall his guarantee that in fact gang
violence and international war crimes are basically the same thing):

"I do not doubt there are spouse abusing wives also, but in any instance,
at least individuals in those situations can leave those situations as
a matter of freedom of choice. I know that I would never remain within a
truly abusive relationship [sounds to me like you'd make one], and feel
bound to be the martyred victim. Probably because I despise
sado-masochism..."

IS ANY COMMENT NEEDED?  Are caps needed?

Thank God for freedom of choice - let's tell all those trapped and abused
wives to stop their fucking sniveling and get a -healthy- sexuality,
shall we.

Maria here is moving this discussion into a direction that I think is
important--and that is that there's a problem with the essentialism of this
gender discussion.  What's "acceptable" verbal behavior for a woman is not
this universal white middle class suburban norm.  There are class
differences, regional differences, and racial differences.  I think that
good middle class liberals are tolerant of racial differences in verbal
expression (afterall it's a good thing to be a good liberal)--it adds
"color" to parties and other gatherings--but only up to a point, there has
to have been a certain degree of white middle class patterns adapted or
that person had better start looking for places other than the avant garde
to get published.

As far as my own case, being raised working class in the Chicago area, I
feel that I have to constantly contain myself when speaking in the middle
class writing world in which I operate.  If I express any sort of anger
people act like I'm Linda Blair in the Exorcist, they're so shocked, like
they're going to faint.  I often think of my sister in law in terms of
expressing anger.  Now, I adore Marie, the sister-in-law, who is considered
in her world to be a normal feminine woman in her thirties--how totally
butch Marie is by the San Francisco standards I operate in, how she'll take
a drag off her cigarette and say, "I wanted to tell that son-of-a-bitch to
kiss my ass."  This is Marie expressing mild disapproval, and everybody who
she talks to understands that.  No way could I say of any of tons of
difficult people I deal with as an arts administrator, "I wanted to tell
that son-of-a-bitch to kiss my ass."  Maybe I could if I was on the East
Coast, I'm always amazed at how much personality women from New York
have--as opposed to the blandness that is enforced here in the Bay Area.

Men on this list have dumped on me time and again for expressing opinions.
Remember last summer when I was accused of "rhetorical violence."  Then
recently when I had my skirmish with Dale (and Dale, please, I'm not trying
to bring that up again)--I was complaining to one of the other men on this
list how I felt attacked and humiliated in public and this guy, who claims
to be a feminist, told me, well you criticized him, you brought it on
yourself.  I think there are good reasons for women to not bother posting
to this list.

I'd just like to add, this is the post-Judith-Butler era--the binary days
of male/female are over.  Last night I ate dinner alone in my favorite
cheap Chinese restaurant and these three drag queens were eating at the
next table in the most wonderfully tacky casual attire, the three of them
seemed very close and were having a great time, and I was having a great
time describing their outfits in my diary, how they seemed to be in this
close-knit world that I (and I imagine most of the other people in the
restaurant) could never comprehend--and I got these pangs of sentimentality
for otherness--to find companionship outside the claustrophobia of the
middle class intelligencia.  I guess my writing workshop is the closest I
come to that.  We have a blast in there.

i am a fan of the personal, but i may be too far on that side. i've been
known to blurt out information about my marital status from the podium. and
regretted it.

This apparently goes with your retitling of your article as

"Re: raped into a chosen martyrdom eh"

What gives you, good sir, regardless of your eminent Harvard education, and
your position of privilege within the world's most politically,
economically, and militarily powerful nation, the right to imply that ?

I have never come anywhere near to raping anyone, in any fantasy or any
reality, and the only few times I ever came near to being raped was by
somewhat older men, when I was a young teenager.

Now, good sir, while you yourself might not have chosen to _always_ and in
_every instance_ respect _any_ man or woman's personal free choice as to
physical intimacy of any kind, I most certainly have always maintained that
to be an inviolable principle. That is true even within a committed
relationship and I was in one for nearly nine years with a woman.

I firmly believe that consent as to ANY physical intimacy must be uncoerced
between persons as equals (neither regarded as submissive or dominant and
each having their own head and freedom of thought and expression say in the
matter). That such consent must be freely given to one another before
physical intimacy can be permissible with each other. That is even true in
marriage. I can also honestly say that I have not taken advantage of any
woman who was in any way inebriated, intoxicated, or unwilling to freely
enter into physical intimacy, and particularly any intimacy that implied
anything even remotely sexual. Also that regardless of my on rare occassion
being a little under the influence, I have invariably appologized for any
unwelcome casual touch. I have never even taken a liberty of the slightest
contact and then excused it as being the workings of some intoxicant. That
includes even the touch of a hand upon a hand, and there it stops.

If that is a martyrdom then so be it. That is not going to change, despite
the urgings of others, mostly men, that I am too conservative and that with
that attitude I will never win my beloved, whomever she is, as they say I
lack the necessary aggressive impulses to sieze by the hair and drag her
down, as would a Neanderthal. Perhaps you are one of those who share that
predilection.

So, what are you on about, other claiming that you perhaps disagree, within
your own life, about that basic principle that I uphold and maintain in mine
?  That and many other principles that I have always maintained or have
learned to maintain.

If that implication is correct, then we certainly have a vast difference of
opinion that is unresolvable, and we must go to war against each other. That
is before you attempt to rape me....or make further claims that some other
has raped me who in fact has not done so.... Either idea is as abhorent as
the idea that I would enter into any such practice.

Shall I suggest pistols at ten paces ?  Who are your seconds ?
Duelling seems to be the only practical recourse, all else considered....

And there we have it, a difference, a conflict, and a war.

>IS ANY COMMENT NEEDED?  Are caps needed?

Caps, capitals, capitations, capitalizations, and caput....all relate to one
another and in fact it has more to do with the heads on coins than anything
else. Lose ones coins and lose one's head, is a common, but not a
commensense, principle that some uphold. One is forever a clown if one does
not hold on to one's money bag and all those heads in there, isn't one ?

Now that is implicative.

Perhaps it depends upon the reasons that one goes caput and decapitalizes.

Good sir, are you, in your holy Harvard sacred business sense of American
economics wisdom claim that that decision to decapitalize one's self, in any
instance, ought NOT to be for the sake of any other, and much less the sake
of a _woman_. Oh, ye gods, forbid, a man caput and decapitate,
decapitalized, because of any woman. So stone the bastard for not having
capital intentions....and put a fools cap on him that he will never get off.
Is that the real digs in what you are, "eh", attempting to goad at ?

Are you saying that the freely chosen agreement with another to in some way
decaptilize one's self, and share what one has, where that action in fact
has nothing whatever to do with any business of profits and losses, but is a
personal matter, is a kind of rape ?

Again, I think pistols at ten paces might be best, with you Mr. Sutherland,
as you seem to know so very much about the matter you allude to, and seek to
tar it over with such a black brush.

Another implicative.

>                morpheal, this comment of yours is plain idiocy

You are right, I stand corrected, as I lack an advanced degree with
which to support the argument.

Clearly you are claiming this list for those with academic tenure and
advanced degrees, are you not ?  If that is the consensual opinion then
of course I shall promptly leave and never say another word about it.

I cannot say best regards.

Your attack was far too venemous to honestly feel that way in response.

This so reminds me of Diana, my roommate in (east coast) art school. In the
midst of a discussion of esthetics spiralling pedogogically, pedantically,
pontificatingly out of control, she took a drag off her cigarette and blurted,
"Aw, fuck art!" That statement helped define our sculpture department in ways I
can't even begin to describe. It became our rallying cry. Everyone stopped
worrying & looking over their shoulders for the art-police and just made
sculpture. I really miss that sort of response, as I work in the buttoned down
world of Silicon Valley.

From what I've seen on the list opinion and feelings (particularly
anger) are generally ignored or trounced - it doesn't seem to matter
who writes it.  This seems to limit discourse to the two extremes
of decorum and vituperation.  The only exception I can recall started
with Tom Beckett's post on depression and writers about a month ago.
I'm sorry he apparently is no longer with us here.

Dear Bob -


seems there've been crossed wires - I would NEVER imply that you had
mistreated or abused anyone, or that your message demonstrated any such
propensity; if this is how my response reads, then please please accept my
sincerest apologies.  I do regret the extent to which my note was
venomous, and for this I'm also sorry.

What I meant by my title was something wholly different - that your
suggestion that women trapped in abusive relationships (often raped into
and in them) as 'martyrs' to a kind of sado-masochistic impulse is crass
and highly offensive - that there's no such thing as a universal opt-out
clause for such individuals, and that sometimes there is no 'freedom' of
choice simple enough to warrant that morally suggestive term.

A few points.

1. I do not hold an advanced degree, masters or doctorate.  So what.
Neither do you.  So what.  Nothing I said made this an issue.  I'm not
attempting to 'claim' this list for anyone.  If the mere fact of my e-
address must incur this rather tangential jibing, I suspect the problem is
not something I can redress.

2. This 'most powerful of nations' is not my nation.  This is the first
year I've lived here, and I'm sure I'd have just as many criticisms of it
as you.

3. There are types of venom: whilst my message was, I admit, too severe
and excessive in its irritation, I found YOUR message incredibly
offensive, really quite like a venom that required a fairly potent cure.
I am - again - sorry if what I said seemed personally directed.


Really - it upsets me that you have written a defense of your most
intimate attitudes as if they had been called into question; I had meant
only to attack the published fact of an array of what I consider to be
abusive remarks.  I AM sorry, and hope that my next response, should this
discussion continue, will be more equable.



But do you see that to claim simple freedom of choice for men and women
constrained (by whatever factor - economic, for instance) to accept a
daily ration of mistreatment, is inconsiderate to say the least?  Have you
never known anybody stuck in such a situation?

fer chrissake...  "Don't underestimate the farmers schoolboys, they
contribute" yes, I'm well aware - this has nothing whatsoever to do with
what I was saying, and neither was it 'farmers and schoolboys' alone that
I mentioned, was it?

>FARMERS SCHOOLBOYS AND INSURANCE SALESMEN

There ARE points to be made, sometimes it IS possible or even necessary to
be polemical or elliptical in making them, does anybody -really- think I'm
underestimating farmers' contribution to the nation just by suggesting
that they (along, as I obviously implied, with everyone else) would not be
able to fend off an attack from the armed forces?  Must this discussion
reach this level of inventive pedantry?  And what's all this sneery
ressentiment re: Harvard?

Re: The point below and Rachel's earlier interpretation of the word
"power"--

To desire that people exercise their "power" is not necessarily to imply
that they subvert or otherwise hinder someone else.

Power can be reactive as well as proactive--defensive as well
as offensive--

When I presume that there are links between speaking, participating, and
power, I am not trying to imply that "powergrabs" are the answer to
anything--or that disenfranchised or otherwise "unpowerful" people need to
rise up and take over the power structures that are now in
"force"--

To, as Rachel puts it, "just do one's work" requires a certain degree of
power--of "self-confidence" and "self-possession" as Woolf might phrase
it.

The exercise of one's power does not need to be synonymous with the
oppression of others.

Re: Keston's question below: the connection between speaking and the
model of power I presented earlier is, as you imply, to try to prevent
such "oppressive" conditions from arising in the first place.

In other words--my use of "speak!" was meant as an incentive to use
power defensively (as in speaking on the list if you disagree with
something)--not offensively per se.

Best, Katy

Look -- Gudding here rising from a recent bath in lurkerdom -- just want
to say what a fine thing it is to see a nice, thoroughgoing apology on
this list.

Apology is, I think, an art that has regrettably made its escape from
American public life.  I'm glad you made one, Mr. Sutherland: it was
needed.

Three things, Henry James said, are necessary in human life. The first is
to be kind.  The second is to be kind.  And the third is to be kind.

Well done. gg

wowzie -- i sure picked a bad week to "sign off" (being in buffalo in
reality but not discursively . . .)

i can't catch up on all of what went down -- but
i really enjoyed reading my male(chris)-edited selection of poetix posts,
thinking, is this the rachel i know & love & thinking that delivering
pizzas (or reading a lot?) has sure hardened you to the wiles of
the world in some way, or you just never showed yourself in my
presence to be the guttermouth you are

but really, katy, i think if you spent a year in salt lake city (as
rachel recently has) you're eyes would be bruised with the blaring
discourse of
#1) female students  missing classes b/c they have
morningsickness, an ob/gyn appointment, or contractions, or they
can't find a babysitter
or #2) female students miraculously almost uniformly slim and blonde,
all giggling and in quest of the sanctioned situation (i.e. #1)

& thinking back a while to maria damon's remark that the higher we
look in education, the higher the female dropout rates (no real mystery
here, right?) -- sure I wish more women were on the list, more women
were sending work out & getting it published -- but that would be
simply wishing for non-existent "women" to materialize -- that is, i
think WE'RE IT -- we're the women we want more of & you only get more
of us by changing the discourses that force women to not  -- not to, not
to want to, to be afraid to  -- become like us.

Hi Linda--

I'm not sure what to make of your description of (presumably) the
undergraduates at U Utah.

Are you trying to say that stereotyping women as such creates more women
who fit the stereotype?

Are you trying to say that feminism has led to some sort of gross
exploitation of the menstruation excuse for skipping classes?

I did gather, I think clearly, that you feel that women drop out at a
higher rate from men as they climb the educational ladder because they
decide to raise families instead of continuing on--

But I have to admit that I don't see the connection between Rachel's views
(which I don't fully understand, I don't think) and the undergrads at U
Utah--

Maybe you mean to say that Rachel doesn't want to be lumped together with
these other "kinds" of women? That Rachel would like to avoid being
perceived as one of these slim blond giggly people? (Though Rachel is slim
and kinda blondish and has a wonderful laugh--and is very generous with
her laughter)?

Best,
Katy

hey linda- glad yer back - oh i don't think at all i's keeping my mouth
shut or not showing my tru colorz or anything like that last year - just
afraid of trigger words after a year of seeing tru colorz of the world of
poetry mongering and stargazing - and so not so much pizza delivering or
slingin other types of hash thats got me worried about the distinction
continually being made between 'our  world', the poetry world and the
'real world' of real world trials and tribulations - and i think you are
pointing out perhaps how they areall of the world thats interpreted and
'lived' - from the slim blondes trying to sell us jesus on utah's campus
to the kind of muse-infested death lyrix continually slung over women's
bodies-

so yeah katy, i think of a way i can understand what yer saying - the
power part oh yes most definitely yes definitely coes in at the part where
one feels one has the necessity, reason, hankering, space (a la woolf) to
do work- that is certainly a certain position of power, of
unself-consciousness i think that may be lots of what women have not had
the chance to take for granted - for many it seems to be something that
comes as a difficult gift from themselves

luv ya

Forgive the personal, I became so intentionally to make a point about what
money and a room of one's own can do for a woman who writes.  I am, though,
interested in the undertones of the "personal" controversy.  Any backchannel
commentaries or clips of previous conversations on this point will be
appreciated.

I am in a strange situation here, my only connection with you all is this
list. I do not know any of you personally, I have never published, do not
work in academia and, indeed, may be outside the pale of the interests
represented by this list.  It takes a great deal of courage for me to post
to this list.  I don't, however, feel that this is a problem of gender, so
please don't anyone misunderstand, it's just a function of how new I am to
this world of poetics.

I hope I did not give the impression that I consider my writing personal to
the point that not everyone could read it.  This was not my intention.  I
write for everyone.  There is nothing I write which I wouldn't share with
anyone who can read my language, but, that includes neither my
mother-in-law- nor my children.  I don't think I would submit it to a random
list of publications either.  Why would I?  My children were made for this
world, it doesn't mean, though, that I would release them on a street
anywhere.  I don't eat just anything and I'm particular about my bath.
That's me and I'm the one writing. Or, was someone making a point about a
divinely inspired process?

Perhaps I'm missing something about personal.  Any enlightenment would be
appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

I've been none too impressed by the tone of discourse on this list over the
past few weeks (dating back to the religious wars), although bright spots
(David Bromige, Dodie Bellamy, Nada Gordon, Joel Lewis) always make it worth
the while, eventually. I'd love it if people could actually try to read one
another once in awhile and leave off the name-calling.

The situation in Jonesboro (which, as a one-time SF resident, I keep hearing
as "Jonestown") is heart-breaking. It's part of the American pathology (the
"pure products" as WCW once put it) that people in this country hardly
question why children who are not old enough to smoke, drink beer or drive
are allowed to be "trained" to use automatic rifles. If ever there was an
argument for the moral and psychological superiority of Canada or the UK,
America's confusion of the gun with its collective penis is it.

There is, I think, no question that this violence is gendered. My wife's
college buddy Corinne Dufka is the chief Reuters photographer in Africa
(after stints in the former Yugoslavia, Chechnya and central America). Her
photos, which periodically can be seen on the Reuters web site (Corinne was
nominated for the Pulitzer last year), all too often show armies composed of
13-year-old boys killing other 13-year-old boys. It's always boys.

Corinne herself took up photography while working in Nicaragua (an
interesting choice given that her mother, and I think a sister also, are
blind) to show what war does to children and has been wounded three times
(once when her jeep hit a land mine in Chechnya) over the past decade.

This is a personal squawk : I just dont get it. Granted that "chrss mccrry"
in his post today is cryptic, I assume from this one-line farewell that
s/he is offended by what's going on with the List. Well, you know, I dont
recall seeing many or any posts from "chrss mccrry". So was s/he lurking
out there, passively allowing us-all to go on without his or her attempting
to intercede?

I dont understanding this running away from difficulties instead of
attempting to cope with them, even to turn their direction. I was sadly
disappointed when Toim Beckett quit after so brief a term with us. But Tom
at least tried to remake the List closer to his heart's desire. I dont
think there was anything like a similar effort from "chrss mccrry".

I dont understand the rudeness, either : the terse implication that we have
somehow failed this pristine noncombatant. And I dont understands the
cowardice : "chrss mccrry" is now presumably not around to receive feedback
on his/her gesture.

But maybe s/he simply posted the "unsubscribe" to the wrong e-ddress, & had
been having technical trouble disconnecting, & my small rant is completely
off-target--if so, most profound and english apologies to all, for
projecting an argument fetched over from elsewhere, onto this innocent
mistake.  David

well I have known such people, some very close to me, whose dependency was
so thoroughly bred into their outlook as to make it impossible for them to
extricate themselves.  And so they were regularly beaten and sexually
abused.  I don't consider this a mere 'claim', no matter how those people
may have changed their minds had they been more enlightened.

Aside: I am trying to post fewer messages so as to avoid the wrath of
       the list godz, but I could not resist saying something to this.

You have never heard of the art factory ?  It has an art assembly line,
where each artist, as a self incorporated entity, MUST crank out, following
the long venerated strategems and techniques of a Henry Ford, a quite
precisely identifiable and narrow range of product line.

They must have a style, or voice, of their own, a recognizable "signature"
in the Derridean sense of that, and most of all they MUST do essentially
the same thing over and over again. Even the divergence into another medium
of expression could be seriously frowned upon as diletantism, as is
experimentation with different styles of writing often dubbed immature style.

The artist is often constrained to the realization that the artist has more
in common with the mass production enterprise of products for the
marketplace than the artist wanted to have. The artist too tends to feel the
need to produce
works that are as remarkably similar as the same model, of the same make,
with various options providing the only differentiation.

Of course I said previously that might be overcome in the evolution of art,
but not yet. Then any artist might deviate into any style, using any media,
in any ways that suit the intentionality of giving communicative form to the
impulses derivative from a sense of aesthetics and a desire to express
meanings. There are signs of that tendency towards liberalism in the arts,
but not its full realization. I think we might see more of that in the very
near future.

Then there might be more acceptable differentiation of the works of art, as
distinct from the works of mass production, and differentiation of the artist
away from the mass producer ?  Perhaps.

    David, I would squawk with you.

    I was out of town for a couple of weeks and was set to nomail.  I have been
back now for a week.  I'll admit I have found the discussions extraordinarily
dreary.  The "issues" have been of the kind that inevitably, perhaps
necessarily, evoke _prescribed_ responses.  It is not a personal fault: to
engage them at all is to assume a stereotyped posture: bad-ass renegade,
enforcer of righteousness, weak-kneed liberal; I am dangerously close to being
a pretentious  voice of community good-sense, etc.

    Poetry and poetics are important precisely because they are our tools for
avoiding  the prescribed (already written), on the one hand, and the hopelessly
(selfishly) quirky, on the other (i.e. "the private self at any public wall";
no one cares about ones private self  but ones mother, and she mind be jivin
you too, as B.B. King realized).

    I do not find the usual forms of civility  interesting or very useful for
mediating the difficult work of a community, but one would hope that among
poets, rudeness and boorishness might find interesting new forms.  Surely, if
nothing more, poetry and poetics can saves us from both graduate school jargon
(as a particularly authorized form of prescription) and  its opposite in
self-conscious, anti-intellectual grousing that  brings only the language of
the popular media as an alternative.

    The World Watch Institute notes that economic “growth during the seven
years since 1990 exceeds that during the 10,000 years from the beginning of
agriculture until 1950” and estimates that the earth cannot sustain this level
of material production for more than twenty additional years. I will highly
recommend web site of the World Watch Institute (http://www.worldwatch.org/)

    We are a culture deeply in trouble. We have nothing in our traditions and
habits that allow us even to think about this world. Poiesis is about the only
human resource in such situations.  These resources, like so many others, it
seems to me, are being squandered.

why would poesis get us out of anything? if not worldwatch, there are
other equally appalling statistics, and nothing changes them, not even

I thought I'd posts some quotes that address the subject of gender and
violence from a different angle--


"Owing to greater uses of cutting objects and other weaponry, Mcleod states
'offenses against men are significantly more serious than are offenses against
women.' Her examination of police reports found 'whereas just one quarter of
all spouse abuse incidents involving female victims are categorized as
aggrevated assaults, the corresponding statistic for male victims is
demonstrably higher"
86 % are aggrevated, over two-thirds of these aggrevated events are serious
assaults with a weapon. "-- Cook-- quoting Mcleod's study of Philadelphia
Domestic Homicides in Abused Men - the Hidden Side of Domestic Violence.


38 % of domestic homicides among white couples in the US are committed by
women .Cook, Abused Men - The Hidden Side of Domestic Violence.

In black family/spousal murders roughly 47% of victims are husbands vs 53 %
wives Cook, Abused Men - The Hidden Side of Domestic Violence.

Women kill their children more often than fathers do ( 55% vs 45 %)
Cook, Abused Men - The Hidden Side of Domestic Violence.

"There are many examples where a man is charged with homicide while a woman
committing a similar act is charged with a lesser offense "(Mcleod -- who
attributes this fact to "chivalry and paternalism on the part of the police")

"It is a well known but often neglected by policy makers that men are nearly
twice as likely as women to be victims of all types of violent crime and three

Excerpt from the text of the book: "Yet, while repeated studies
consistently show that men are victims of domestic violence as often as
are women, `both the lay public and many professionals regard a finding
of no sex difference in rates of physical aggression among intimates as
surprising, if not unreliable,' the stereotype being that men are
aggressive `and women are exclusively victims.' "

"The fact that women had higher mean and median rates for severe violence
suggests that female aggression is not merely a response to male aggression"--
from a study by the National Family Violence Counsel

Not to suggest that statistics tell the whole story (they are always "cooked"
no matter who employs them), but I thought it might be instructive to post
work that show a different picture as regards gender & violence. This is in no
way meant to suggest that feminist concerns are not viable in this field of
inquiry-- they most certainly are, and much good has and will continue to come
out of them. Rather it is meant to serve as a partial answer to some of the
posts that suggest "it's always boys". As a psychotherapist who did emergency
work and commitments for about two years and was in private practice for
another two, I spoke to women who had beaten their husbands, men who had been
treated violently at the hands of women and  men who had been victims of
sexual abuse by women. They were all well aware of the silence ( read
disbelief) with which their stories are often met. A final note-- as far as I
am aware these studies are pertinent in the United States only,& all but the
McNeely citation can be found in Cook's Abused Men - the Hidden Side of
Domestic Violence. There are other books and many more articles on this
subject available, but Cook's is the only one I could find at the library near
my home.

Don--

By your message I gather that you have found the discussion about feminism
and women's participation on this list "dreary." This is my
assumption--and if this is what you meant, then you should come out and
say it (likewise w/Ron Silliman).

I understand your concerns about what you characterize as stereotypical
forms of response on a list like this one: "the righteous," "the
victim," "the defender" etc...

But by saying this I think you very much reduce the content of some of
these messages. What's been going on here in the last week is far more
complicated than simple "dreariness" or, as you also imply, "irrelavance."

Sure, the discussion has not been particularly witty nor flush
with facts. I would guess (and maybe I'm wrong) that you and many others
who might find such a discussion dreary have not even cracked most of the
foundational texts in regards to this issue.

In which case, you may not be seeing the more subtle aspects of some of
these posts.

When you say that "our tradition and history" don't know what to do about
a world in crisis--and that poesis is somehow a salve if not a
remedy for this, then I think you must be on another planet.

I am not the most energetic activist. I am not yet clear (I am 25) on
what to do about this world in crisis. But I think that a working out of
gender issues, and race issues, and class issues--all of which are
imbricated with poverty, overconsumption, and one another--is a big first
step.

Part of the discussion here in the last week has regarded various forms
of competition and the ways in which they are engendered.

I believe quite strongly that discussions about modes of conversation,
violence as it pertains to gender, and polemicism on this list have
everything to do with an attempt to alter the course of this
"world in crisis"--

Could you please explain to me what you see as the precise
connection(s) between poesis and our impending environmental doom?

Gary Snyder?

Best,
Katy

     Poiesis gets us out of nothing, but one does not have a world by
stumbling into it.You imagine a world from the best data you have. I
mention the World Watch data as it seems actively repressed, and when
crucial information in a culture is repressed, all of the modes of
production are poisoned, including poiesis.

<semi-rant>
A lot of interesting posts flying recently; really good discussion.  Mr/s D
W Have posted a litany of statistics that nicely illustrate that nothing,
even gender, is as simple as anybody on any side of the issue would have
the rest of us believe.

I have the 'joy' of living in a state where a gubernatorial candidate less
than a decade ago said --on the question of rape-- that women should just
lay back and enjoy it.  To be even cruder (if that's possible): they asked
for it.  The nasty little game of labelling someone a victim and then
blaming them for it, too.  Neat trick that.

Of course, the flip side is the argument that gender
agression/problems/whatever all source in the male ultimately.  Some where.
 Some decade.  Some how.  One post worried about not getting a date because
of a man's reaction (like men never worry about that) while being somewhat
horrified that men do very much the same thing.  In simple terms, perhaps
we all hope to play our half of the sexual game without an
'opponent/partner'.  They don't call it a dance for nothing.

Something that keeps shooting by on tangents, for me, is the notion a lot
of people seem to have that there is only one kind of man/one kind of
woman.  I did choose 'the male' above somewhat intentionally.  Which makes
things interesting.  "The male of the species struts about either verbally
or physically, preferably both, exuding as much testosterone as possible.
The male must show his superiority over all other males (not to mention
those non-males over there).  The male must mate."  And we construct
similar silly images of women.  Of course, the construction is complicated:
men construct images of women, women reconstruct and appropriate those
images and so on.  And the same thing happens in regard to the image, the
role of men.  Ever need a good example of the hermeneutic for class, pull
other gender roles and I just bet everyone will get it.

One comic boiled it down much more politely (than my nature show example)
by labeling men hunters, women gathers.  He started here, had sold out
shows for over year & then moved off broadway and (from what I hear) still
sells out.  Why?  Because people tend to hold every one up these little
preconceptions.  And there's enough truth someone in the big lies (male,
female) that almost everyone seems to match somewhere.  Ah ha!  They must
match the rest of it!  Or worse yet --for the person being identified,
classed, disected-- they really don't match any of it, so the mind throws
out the example (don't want to add any grays to our easy map to life) or
classifies that person as abnormal.  How many guys on the list, who like me
are 'heterosexual' remember being called "faggot" in the halls during say
Junior High.  Ya don't fit the image, ya ain't part of the dance or your
ignored or both.

Backing around to the litany of statistics, they do quite a bit to not just
shine light, but confuse (as statistics are want to do).  While they point
out that women assaulting men tend to be more violent (ahhh! blame them
lil' ol women bitches agin) they do nothing to point out how often those
reactions are to the violence of men... versus how often there was no
violance on the male end of the equation.  Of course, statistics have a
hard time quantifying (like statistics do anything but attempt to quantify)
the mental games by one party or the other that lead to the situtation.

<end semirant>

Ah, yes, hopefully this doesn't start any flame wars... just thoughts, for
the listserv mill.

Tim

Hi Rebecca,

I don't think you're missing anything about the personal. Sometimes people take
the attitude that the personal is somehow less than the "objective," an idea
I've always disagreed with, but an idea that some people hold nonetheless.

Do you write in Thai only? I have to tell you: your notes are so beautifully
written that it made me want to see more of your writing. Do you write poetry,
or prose, or both?

Don't feel too concerned about the sometimes clubbish attitude of the list: I
know a very few of the people on the list from having met at readings, a few
only through correspondence, and some just through the list.

I don't know if everyone agrees, but I think a large number of listees think as
I do, that anyone who writes is very welcome to participate. I for one have
enjoyed your voice immensely, and you "personal" post has left me with a strong
image of your garden writing house and the questions of mothers-in-law &
children, a world similar to and different from the one I  as a woman/mother
work in.

Karen

--Yes, I think those statistics seemed awfully skewed. The point is well
taken that men suffer from violence as much if not more than women. But
the issue seems to be a little more complex than that.

It seemed that Have's statistics left out some key information.
1. If men suffer from aggravated assault more than women, do men also
perpetrate aggravated assault more than women? Who are the perpetrators
statistically?

Are you saying that men beat up other men as much as they beat up women,
so violence isn't gendered?

2. To say that rates of violence are similar in both male and female
prison populations is an interesting statistic, but isn't this a pretty
specific statistical group? Does it reflect the general population in any
regard?

3. Your statistics concerned domestic violence--and were informative in
regards to this (though the fact that they all came from a single
source--and that this source seemed interested in proving that men
suffered from domestic violence, not just women, seems suspicious to
me...)--what about violence in the public sphere?

I would like to see some statistic about rape. How many men are raped
outside of prison?

I would like a clarification of your statistic about child abuse. Do women
abuse their children sexually more than men do? Do they hit their
children? Neglect their children? Could you be more specific?

I would like to see statistic about guns and the use of guns. Do women
assault or massacre others with guns as often as men do? Or is it rolling
pins that they employ?

***

Ron, I have to take issue again with your earlier post.

In that post you seem to discourage the new voices that have popped up on
this list in the last week from contributing further. The list of--was it
four people?--whom you cited as having interesting things to say were to
say the least very usual suspects. I enjoy their posts, but I have
also been glad to see so many new voices posting as well.

As Summi said in an earlier post, not everyone has to have something
brilliant, tonally satisfactory, or original to say to be of interest, at
least to me, on this list.

You seem to imply that only well-formulated posts from brilliant minds are
wanted here.

Perhaps some might feel intimidated to post up here with the
likes of you (this is a sincere compliment, not sarcastic)--

I found your post vague in regards to these issues--how has the list
disappointed you as of late?

Best,
Katy

-when- crucial info's repressed?  When HASN'T it been?  If everything has
always been poisoned (poetry too), the poison's slow-working into
endlessness and why worry?  Cannot the exhibition of crucial info poison
also?


Plus: (and this not directed to you Don) it's harmless enough, the general
anti-boor cry and aloof semi-urge to decorum, but this though harmless
stakes little in hope of redress and does nothing to counter indecorous
-argument-: neat-mannered locutions are not a cure for ignorance, not a
resistance to bad ideas other than the idea of bad locution (which idea
can tyrannize as any other and frequently does), and do seem so dubiously
efficacious in propagating a writer's tidy moral amplitude.

I dont think we in Canada are any more (& perhaps not less) under a tyranny
than you down there in the good ol' US of A, & we do have gun laws. And I
do think that ideology can be as controlling as any 'dictator,' at least in
terms of maintaining a 'way of life.' Are US citizens really that much more
able to defend their 'freedom,' & change governments than we in Canada? I
dont think so: we're both 'ruled' by certain oligarchic forces which seem
to have no problem maintaining their power, whether or not the so-called
citizens, now known as 'consumers' etc, own a bunch of guns (I think the
statistic for Arkansas was at least 3 guns per person).

So it goes.

Ron: While recent posts have made it clear that the assumption of violence
being gendered is at least open to question, it's certainly still true that
males carry most of the guns; if wars were included in the violence
statistics men would come out ahead. I suspect that as traditional
divisions of labor become obsolete, as they largely have in the US, this
inequity will become less severe. Now that women have relative control over
procreation and means of supporting themselves outside of marriage, for
instance, women are being trained and employed in warfare more openly than
they have been in the past, when they were content to engage in sobotage
and the occasional use of their sexuality as a lethal weapon (Judith of
Bethulia comes to mind). I fully expect that women will be enthusiastic
participants at the next My Lai.

Or do you think that violence is not only gendered but genetic?

I was sorry to read in today's Providence Journal that poet Aimee Grunberger
had died at 44.  Last I heard she was involved at Naropa, had been
getting published.  Back in the EARLY SEVENTIES we were in college together.
She was somebody with a lot of vitality & feeling.  The obit gave no
cause of death.  Sad to see her go.  A free spirit.

Spring is here, people.  Whatever will ameliorate life it involves empathy
and understanding.  "Love has no pride", as Bonnie Raitt was singing the
other day. God is neither male nor female, but spirit.  Nor is God a respecter
of persons, nor is God blind to oppression in any form.  God has no wrath,
as Isaiah puts it.  Life is brief, art better be good. What's the point in
complaining about the "quality" of the posts to the list?  Just try to add
something interesting yourself.

The closing of the U of Arkansas Press was announced by the University's
Chancellor, John A. White, in a meeting with the Press staff last Tuesday
afternoon, March 24th. The Chancellor made his decision without consulting
the Press Board, the University chairs, deans, or other faculty, or the
Board of Trustees.  His decision was based entirely on the Press's current
finances, which indicate an ongoing deficit, with an annual subsidy from
the University of roughly $250,000--an amount which the Chancellor will
transfer to the University Library.  The Press has operated under
University subsidy since its inception in 1980.

The Chancellor's decision has aroused strong negative response from
throughout the University community and around the state. His argument
that "university presses are supposed to be self sustaining" has been
widely questioned, especially by several university press directors at
other universities.

Chancellor White came to the University of Arkansas from Georgia Tech last
July.  His elimination of the University Press was his first major act as
chancellor.

The University faculty will meet later this week in an emergency session
to discuss the matter, though, at the moment, there is little reason to
believe that the decision can be reversed.

Not even sure if we need to play statistical games here to disagree with
Silliman and this guns-boys nonsense.  Withstanding any Chomskian critque that
might be possible here, most of us in LA have seen a lot of press given to the
rise of women within gangs, and the rise of gangs made entirely of women.
Lately, the contentions made in several books about gang violence are that
women are actually more violent in these situations:  mutilations, choice of
weapon.  Perhaps to prove themselves in relation to men.  Nonetheless,
graffiti goes on.  And a women gang member has just as much opportunity to
spray paint the highway as a male gang member.  A can of paint is the same
price for either a man or a woman.  A magazine is the same price to publish.
Setting aside gender-pay inequalities for a moment, I think what some people
are resistant to here, in this gender discussion, is its relevance to poetic
action, much less political action.

How is a women's poetry different from a man's and what does a man get from
reading a women's poems?  Sincerely, I'd like to hear an answer.  If it turns
out that they want the same thing, would still be productive discussion.  I
don't mean "is it "vaginal?"  I mean what is not available to women as poetic
technique that is available to a man.  What makes it more difficult for a
women to publish a magazine?

As everyone here knows, this is an extremely marginalized contigent:
innovative poets.  At a certain point, I'm not sure that gender is
contributing to much further marginalization.

Am not sure that a gay writer published in some small magazine is ever going
to inspire others to be bold enough to write a poem, publish a magazine or do
anything that will improve the status of literature, whether or not anyone
knows he's a gay poet.

But it seems to me that what Katy is doing with Explosive magazine, what Post-
Apollo Press is doing, what (the press that published Laynie Browne's
Rebecca's Letters, name escaped) is doing is helpful to the cause.

Should Katy quit publishing men?

It seems to me that any discussion of gender (and I'd prefer, say, class) that
does not mobilize the entire samizdat cause is a thorny issue.  Because this
side of literature is in such tenuous shape, I'm not sure it makes sense to
critique it in terms of gender.  Or at least, I don't think it is sufficient.
Nor is class sufficient, etc.  Wouldn't it be more productive to discuss the
evolution of women's writing in historical terms.

I'm leery of any gender conversations where one side cannot critique the very
side they happen to be on.  That is, one could have any bone to pick with Katy
or Rachel or whomever, and still be more or less on their side.  What can a
man say to a women about gender issues without somehow becoming oppressor.

 I suspect that if a man picked a bone against the way a few women were
handling a few feminist issues, the ensuing argument would be not all
productive to making it easier for anyone to write a poem.

As for this issue of women stopping school and going off to raise families, no
doubt many women have felt that they lost out to do this.  Norma Cole didn't
publish anything until her forties, I believe, so I think it is a real issue
(whatever gender a dead god happens to be).

But, much more of an issue is the fact that everyone on this list could stop
writing poems and write fiction.  More money and more prestige, to many
people's eyes.  Not to mention the easy fact that anyone who would stop
writing and become a doctor would get more prestige, money, etc.  I tend to
think class is a bigger concern here as it is prohibitive to all
forms/manners/subjects of writing.  And it certainly effects who gets
published, who gets to go to grad school, who gets tenure, who publishes the
books and who they have to kind to in order to fund their crusade.

I would be interested in hearing how being a woman affect the practice,
technique, and method of writing.

Not at all against hearing how simple-minded all this might be.

I am calling for disarmament even in the shape of a thorn.

Hi Standard,

I found your post really provocative and clear. And I see most of your
points (although I don't see how anyone is begging the question of
whether or not I should stop publishing men)[?]--

I had two responses to the things you said.

The first had to do with the assertion you make about the marginality of
experimental writing.

I think you underestimate the impact that these poetries have on the
larger discourse. Here at Iowa--a bastion of various forms of
institutional conservatism (a reputation to uphold, a slew of ambitious
people coming through at any given time, a place where awards are taken
seriously etc...)--the poetries of which you speak are taken very
seriously.

I have heard numerous people claim that, in fact, "experimental" poetry
gets more attention here than do other poetries; that it is cooler to
write experimentally; that only experimental poets are taken seriously (I
don't fully agree, but don't feel that this opinion comes out of
nowhere...).

I, for one, have been encouraged to put out Explosive--and in fact have
received free copying from the department here.

I have held a number of benefit events for the magazine. At least half of
the entire (fiction and poetry) have attended these and had fun.

I agree that experimental poetry is marginalized in a number of ways.
Prizes and other types of awards are not as available to writers who
participate in this discourse--

The New Yorker and other "popular magazines" that pay are for all
intents and purposes closed to these forms of poetries--

Etc...

But I think that in the long run poets like Scalapino, Hejinian, Palmer,
and Susan Howe will have a much larger impact on the writing that comes
out of here than will, let's say, those like Wilbur or Kizer or even Hass.

The reasons for this are complex--but it seems to me that experimental
writing as it exists today (complete with big presses, book prizes,
teaching positions and so on...) gives young writers more permission to do
certain things than some of the more conservative writers who are now in
vogue.

Primary among the reasons for experimental poetry's ascendence here has to
do with something intangible in the air--its greater "sexiness" perhaps.

There are a number of examples outside of Iowa as well--

APR, The Boston Review, The Denver Quarterly, The Colorado Review and on
and on are more and more available to experimental poetries--

It may just be a trend. Or it may be because of what I allude to
above--the growing presence of experimental work on the larger
institutional scene (witness Sun & Moon, The Bobst Prize, New American
Writing, New College, Brown, Santa Cruz etc...)--

Or it may be some form of "slumming it in the avant-garde"--I don't know.

So I do think that experimental poetry is visible enough and important
enough to necessitate an occassional cleaning out of its "gender house"--

***

As to what you state below:

I notice that it is okay on this list to say that the topic of gender is
"stupid" or "irrelavant" or "boring" (not to imply that you have said
such things per se)--but it seems always okay to speak about class.

When it comes to righteousness of tone, I've seen some real doozies that
regarded class on this list.

More to the point, however, how can you claim that more of us suffer
from or are otherwise affected by class than by gender?

Women aren't the only creatures of this world who are shuttled
into gender category that seems to be culturally backed up by sanctions
of various sorts--

It seems to me, and this is an old argument, that the fact that women are
divided by cultural and class lines at all times--that women have no
"culture" to call their own--translates into the notion that
gender is a less "important" category than class, which, after Marx, has
taken on a pretty powerful aura as its own "culture".

To be gendered male is to belong to an unmarked category--or so you
seem to imply in your comments below. Are you trying to say that all of
us suffer from financial stress, but that only some of us suffer from
stress that is gender-related?

We ALL share the problems and ramifications of class. And we ALL share the
problems and ramifications of gender.

This does not mean that poetry written by women or men or anyone else is
by nature any which way--just as poetry written by poor people or rich
people or anyone else is not by nature any which way--

But it also, in my view, does not mean that trends--that circumstances
that appear to produce tendencies based on categories--are not important
topics of discussion.

Is class more relavant to the production of poetry than gender?

Is class any less of a blanket term? Is the assignment of class any less
constraining in our society than the assignment of gender?

Is a discussion of poetry as it relates to class any more specific than a
discussion of poetry as it relates to gender, or sex, or age?

As I said, your post made me think a lot.

Thanks,
Katy

One thing that irks me greatly about this list is that it keeps me away
from the cherry blossoms, newly opened and splendid, not to mention the
jasmine and orange & purple pansies on my veranda

but my head is so full with the discussion of this past week

one reason I have not been more vocal was that I was off on a spring
vacation jaunt to Kanazawa and Kyoto.  Kanazawa is an old castle town on
the Japan sea coast.  Kyoto was so gorgeous I hallucinated gardens and
paper and designs for two full days after I came back

I really have wanted to speak my piece, especially on the exchange that
went on between Katy and Rachel

I agreed with both of them/neither of them

because there are two women inside of me (and I'm asking now how many other
women feel this way):

one who is historicized, bleating and roaring (the one who was ignored in
math class -- thanks Katy; or the one with the ruffled leotard -- hey, I
*still* wear those; or the one hitting misogyny over the head every day and
still not killing it)

and one who, while not ungendered (or maybe, as Don wrote, "poeticized and
sexual, but not gendered"?), is a being -- a creature of the universe --
empowered by nature (as Rachel wrote: choosing to, not take up the burden
of everything constructed as history that says YOU WOMAN,YOU ARE
DISENFRANCHISED)

they toggle each other, these two women

both of them acknowledge their debt and express gratitude to the pioneers
and strugglers; both pioneer when they can; the historicized woman
struggles; the other one moves on

if we are always bleating and roaring, we can't be creative
we reify our disenfranchisement

we should bleat and roar
we are disenfranchised
but we can do so much more (Katy's second model of power)

exemplification:

I hate women's writing workshops -- I have participated in a few and even,
uh, hostessed, one on this side of the Pacific.  At workshops like these
the common response to my writing is puzzled silence, "what are you trying
to SAY with this?" or "there are some interesting images here, but I don't
you think you should be more accessible" as if that constituted a response
to the work.  Mostly these are pieces that, by language poet standards,
might be considered highly SUBJECTIVE, even THEMATIC or LYRICAL.  The kind
of writing that these women's groups seem to sanction, though, is reportage
-- on relationships, childhood memories, life incidents, mostly, without
emphasis on the formal features of the writing, i.e. the poetry.  The
responses tend to the "thank you for sharing" *nurturing* *supportive*
variety -- even to writing that, to my torqued-out ear, isn't interesting
at all.  This seems to me to be Tannen's cooperative dynamic at its most
nauseating.

Dodie, is your workshop any different?  Or do you take issue with my
description?

(an aside, but when I read Tannen's book I ws struck by the similarity of
the cooperative style to Japanese communication styles -- another topic
altogether)

On the other hand, I hate mixed writing workshops even more, where the
women sit silent while the men light into each other with their ideas of
how they would have written the poem, with their all-important opinions.
Voila, the competitive dynamic.

I posted a poem called *my penis* this week and got a response like this
from morpheal.  I excerpt it here:


>Drumbeat sounds so damn violent. Sure you shouldn't change that ?
>
>I don't know....but it's too full of traditional metaphors and unclear
>as to what you really want to convey.....

and my response to him:

>1) "unclearness" as to what I want to "convey" happens to be my poetics.
>If it were clear it would be prose.
>
>2)  language as vehicle or conveyance is an obsolete metaphor -- get over
>it, dude.
>
>3)  Did I solicit your opinion?  You know, a big ugly fat guy came up to
>me after one of my readings/performances and told me how he thought I
>could have done it more effectively.  I told him he could shove his
>patronizing attitude up his ass.  DITTO.


Hmm, so I guess I do roar.  And am boorish sometimes and violent (sorry Ms.
Tannen to disprove your points).  I apologize to Morpheal for that, and for
quoting him here without permission.  It does, though, offer an example of
how some men respond to some women's public utterances. No wonder we may
feel intimidated (but I guess I showed him -- gee). It also shows how the
public sphere, including this list, can be sites of viciousness -- as well
as (I don't remember who said it) conviviality. Or maybe that I just can't
take criticism?

Ending with questions again:

1)  Patriarchy is a miserable farce and we should work like hell to destroy
it, but not to replace it with...arggh...matriarchy!  Smothering!  Bossy!
So how can we all parent (the) society (of the poetics list) equitably?

2)  A fascinating-to-me side topic that Elizabeth Hatmaker touched on was
one of women in positions of institutional power, esp. teachers (what about
mothers), and a question about alternative pedagogies.  Joe Amato has
written about this in great inspiring detail before, and as for me, I'm
delving into Paolo Freire and Julian Edge and William Glasser for ways to
balance the power relationship in the classroom, because always to be cast
as authority is awful.  Not sure that this is directly related to POETICS
(although seems like just about anything can be, that's the beauty of it),
but I'd be happy to talk backchannel with any co-fascinatees.

love and cherry blossoms (finally I can get to them)

nada


p.s.  Yesterday I saw a Japanese mom teaching her adolescent daughter how
to throw a  baseball!

"Love has no pride", is true enough, but I cannot say anything about "god".
I would have to be completely agnostic about that, as I know of only the
many human creations that they seek to dignify with that term. I also know
that whatever that "god" that is so talked of is, it has never eased an ache
of any kind, or met any need, or caused any passionate hope to be actualized,
in itself and purely as a binary relation. Everything has been decisively
and purely human, no matter how I look at it.

Subject: The Personal in Poetics

While the question of the personal on the list is being discussed,
I thought I might ask about what seems like a contradiction to me:
in the earlier discussion of depression there was quite a bit of
personal disclosure, credit given to those who had made these
disclosures; there was an assumption that personal experience brought
with it a valuable kind of authenticity. The recent discussion is too
fresh to require summing up. My question is this: why is it that when
poetry is discussed the personal often seems in some way proscribed.
Someone spoke of Robert Hass's "embarrassing honesty." Others have
"cringed" at emotional revelations in poetry. Ted Hughe's work (which
I have no interest here in defending) was criticized for employing

language as a transparent medium, and for being based on the self
as unitary rather than perfomative.(Now, the selves who suffered from
depression did not sound performative to me, but I might be trying
to grasp this on the wrong register.) But I gather that the prevailing
poetics of this list would seem to rule out most of what has been termed
"personal" as being unacceptable in poetry. If scores of examples to
the contrary spring to everyone's mind, that's fine. My question is
typed here without a great deal of planning--that's how I use email.
I'm not trying to be airtight in any kind of logic. In any case, I
would like to get some takes on the way the personal appears or doesn't



appear in most experimental poetry, and why.

Have to agree with Katy, that in fact so-called marginal poetics are
hardly that, one of the surprises for a foreigner such as m/s hereabouts
is the extent to which relatively innovative poetries are promulgated
(Prynne's and Wilkinson's last books in the UK were both - even after
their long careers and magnificent achievements - just stapled & xeroxed
pamphlets, a hundred or two in each print-run).  Not that this has much if
anything uneconomic to do with that spectral enthusiasm re: 'transparent'
vs. 'material' word-uses, what a load of baloney ultimately.  But it's
great here for young writers, there's a lot of contact and sharing - ever
listen in on the British Poets list?  If 'marginal' is, prior to
obfuscating sketches of noble poetic tendencies, a real quality of verse
rather than a kind of logo, I would be really interested to hear why (of
course, some poetries are still strictly marginal, usually those which
wouldn't consider themselves importantly characterized by this
money-name).

Happy birthday, Morpheal.

I just talk about God because it's so politically gauche on this list,
where the main thing is to impress with your left critique in various ways.
It's fun to slam & annoy people.  Bumper cars.

Humans, as you say, do all the caring & loving - but the thought of God is
like the thought of Nature & Purpose & all those aboriginal things -
sometimes when nobody's around (like in the Frost poem) that's all that's
left.  (I'm just giving you the barest minimum.)

Nada,
        this sounds exactly like my vagina! It also puts into question an
observation by Camille Paglia: "Sex is metaphysical for men, as it is
not for women."

I find this somewhat humourous. I am actually in Canada. In Canada I think
there are enough weapons currently in the hands of citizens to quell any
usurpation of power, if one occurred, even if a significant part of Canada's
military forces joined with the usurpers to make it a coup d'etat. Not all
of the military would join and add to that faction some armed citizenry, the
siezing of power outside of constitutional and electoral means, is most
likely currently impossible.

Actually, there is tendency among American military and ex-military, including
reserves and ex-reserves, to keep firepower of their own on hand. I would
not want to say that on the public listserv because that might cause someone
to go after someone else's stockpile. It is not so openly discussed. There
is a healthy sense of paranoia of the government and of any possible abuse
of power by the military, particularly among many of those who have been in
it. Therefore the unofficial militia tends to always be prepared. Most of
those who are miltarily trained, would, I believe, be ready to use their
weapons against their own government's use of oppressive, unconstitutional,
force, if that government acted sufficiently outside of the laws that govern
its actions, in ways that were convincing that power had been usurped and
was being maintained by illegal
means such that there was no other recourse.

One of the mysteries of America, but one best kept under one's hat and not
spread around too much.

Bob Ezergailis

hi standard s. --this is the first time we've engaged in
discourse & granted I'm not sure where you're coming
from/ how to "read" you -- but i find most of your comments engage in
a sort of numbers game -- maybe because your responding in part to
katy's demand for "more women" -- but i'd like to move from that
place, from the place of questions about what "women" "should" do and
with what amount of "difficulty" or
how "they" write -- since I or katy or rachel can only tell you what
we as particular people should/could/want/do, i'm not sure how we can
help define this "cause"

-- you mention several curious things at the end of your post
 -- prestige, money, improving the quality of literature (?), a
"crusade" -- which speak not only this "equality rap" -- but which
also curiously narrativize the actions of several individuals into a
unified "cause" -- & i find your narrative to be based on certain
"universal" assumptions -- this one was particularly puzzling:

 i agree (i think) but why?  You're calling on the performance of good
old anglo-feminism, i think, that is to un- or dis-cover an otherwised
silenced history -- ?  And I couldn't do this with out discussing the
historical terms!! who's terms are they?  I mean who's texts will we
read to discover the historical terms by which to discuss women's
writing?  I say let's throw the baby out with the bathwater and go
find some new babies.

and when you mention "relevance to poetic action":

I wonder if you're not assuming that "feminist" poetry must per se
"voice" a feminist agenda?  or that poetry is feminist because it is
gendered via content?  Which is the only way, i think that poetry
written by women & men could be said to "differ" -- by taking up
the issue of difference & expressing patiruclarly "feminist" attitudes
(i.e. if it involves itself with those discourses) -- but even that
is just performing gender --

but a question that for me gets more to the heart of the matter is
> I mean what is not available to women as poetic
> technique that is available to a man.
well, i don't think the universal subject-position is as available,
as that's "man" -- i mean it's necessary for "voicing" otherwise
"erased" experiences  -- but it can only express thus by co-opting a
whole set of (male-constructed) assumptions (from Aristotle onward)
-- the very assumptions that provide the context for "oppression"

-- i mean i might march on washington & yell "no
more coathangers" but my poems, in order to be
"feminist", don't have to. my feminism, as it is engaged in
my poetics, is about disengaging language from certain
oppressive discourses -- one of them being that of enlightenment ideas
of the subject.

"i agree" -- ?  again, i'm not sure what you're after -- since this
statement seems to cast us into a narrative which a certain history
has constructed.

whoa. i wish charles' b. woulda said we had to worry abt. prestige or
money to join the list . . . but again, i think my problem is with
the way you narrativize the actions of distinct women writers into a
"crusade" -- yes, katy seems to be on a crusade when she calls for
more women writing & publishing, etc.  well i've already made myself
clear on where i differ on that point i think.

well i could tell you how it affects MY writing, but would that be
answering your question?

katy sed:

the question is who is stereotyping?  is it a stereotype to say
basketball players are good at basketball?  I'm simply saying these
women work hard to be good at what their institution tells them to
do -- in the way it tells them to do it.  so they're an instance of
that liminal space where discourse & "reality" meet, if you like.
they literally "wear" the discourse of their institution (though that
metaphor may be reductive, as it tends to flatten out the complexity
of what goes on, since "changing clothes" isn't that easy, & because
what I call "their institution" is, well, many discourses {buy this,
wear that, eat this, throw that up [I literally walked in on a bulimic
in a pizza place bathroom here once -- calculate the chances of THAT
happening & we'll maybe get a sense of how frequent such a coping
device is, especially here in the happy gap-baby valley].
-- but this again is simplifying -- i don't mean to say that the
"discourse" is the messages, the rhetoric that dictates
their/our lives -- but then again, as we say, money talks . . .})
>

rather, if feminism means winning for a woman the "choice" of whether or
not to pursue an "education" (a popular one here is family & consumer
studies -- ha!) -- then we're not working hard enough
>

you mean they opt to perform normative behaivor rather than risk being
labeled "odd" or "maladjusted" (easy to get Freudian here -- they're
simply not carrying out their prescribed narrative! & we know freud
fudges on the girl-narrative anyway)
>

i hope i made this a little clearer above.  I mean it's easy to look
back on our lives & think we had a lot of "choices" -- where to go to
school, what color to make our hair, whether to have hair in certain
places [one day i heard a young woman in a burrito place telling two
male peers (read: potential husbands) that she was going to have
electrolisis on her upper lip & chin] -- but many of these choices are
relegated, regulated -- & again i feel i'm simplifying, this is the good
old Althusserian concept of ideology -- but the point is "reality" is
saturated with discourse, it's textual (in the most vulgar sense that
words construct it, i.e. when we see dense Maine woods & say a "o look
a virgin forest" (or even an "old growth forest" for that matter) we can't
see the forest for the words (old growth = $$$). but i'm starting to
digress. . .

well that's simply not a danger! I mean she's good a playing a
different game --   besides i think rachel would just
like to avoid being perceived  --

Worth a response on both lists certainly even though I do not have
a great deal to add as I share your puzzlement at the reticence.
I do think it is cultural and possibly it bears some relation to
the gender issue.  As noted by someone earlier the personal does
not always reflect the general when talking about gender issues -
I live in an all-female house but feel that I am much more open t
o honest expression of feeling than any of them.

     As a psychologist, I am tempted to say that the reticence you
note has a lot to do with fear - someone who avoids touching on the
p3rsonal actually reveals more about themself.  However, as a poet
I'm pretty sure it has to do with a distrust of our current language
usage's ability to convey feeling without lapsing into hollywood
bathos.

Hi Linda--

Thanks for clarifying your earlier post--

My response was not meant to be polemical--I was just having trouble
reading your tone--

(I think both you and Rachel sometimes use a kind of happy-go-lucky light
tone when speaking of "serious" matters--I, of course, have no sense of
humor whatsoever!)--

---

I myself wish to clarify something as well--

I don't think I'm on any kind of crusade.

And I'm not "calling for more writing and publishing by women."

Rather, I feel that if a woman (or man or whoever) WANTS to write, or
WANTS to publish, then they shouldn't feel that their gender is a
hinderance to this--

In other words, if someone wants to keep their writing private, that's
their decision. But if they are "afraid" to show their work to others--or
to write that work in the first place--because they are intimidated by
a real or imagined response to their gender, then that's lame.

That's all I'm saying.

---

Also: as to the persistent insistence that discourse IS reality--that
I'm trying to draw some sort of false distinction between the "real"
and the "discursive"--

(I mean gee, I've done my homework--read Derrida, Foucualt, etc....)

I feel that there is a point at which discursivity as a descriptive
term loses its edge--

In other words--when terrible events happen, I don't always feel that
it's helpful to speak of discourse. The reason for this is that
dicourse is by nature rhetorical--and rhetoric can be abused.

If someone is raped, for instance, I find it risky to speak in terms of
larger discourses as they lead up to or away from this event (I believe
in events). If discourse is foregrounded here, then I think it detracts
from the ontological immediacy of what happened.

Call me a phenomenologist, but whatever....

To say that "everything is discourse" in my view is like saying that
"everything is fate"--or "love"--or "truth"--or "terrific." It doesn't
help me out in a jam--

---

I like your characterization of Rachel as, perhaps, a creature not
wanting to be "perceived"--I like that a lot. Rachel?

Yours,
Katy

Brava to Nada Gordon for her lucid post(s) and her fiercely rooted stance.
As much as I am aware of gender limits, and have worked to defeat them, I
must say that family is not necessarily one of these. I have raised three
kids for the past 24 years and have written and published all that while.
During some of that time I was single. My model was my father, who said to
me many times when he saw me writing as a child, "don't do what I have
done-- don't ever find an excuse for NOT writing. You do not need a perfect
place or a perfect condition." His "excuse" had been that he had to make a
living for his family.
Yes, it's difficult to find time, money, space to write. For all of us.

now here's a term to sink our teeth into, even more innuendo than
experimental, I always thought marginal meant: undiscovered, too weird
to be the real thing, outside the status politic, or perhaps subtextual
to the "real" discourse. but then, come to thinnkk of it, some of my
best writing, is the writing in the margins....or I picture books that
only have text printed in the margins, with the "page" left bare.

Katy:

Thanks for your thoughtful reply.  I hope you are right that experimental
writing is having the influence that you say it is.  All I know is that it
isn't on the shelves around here.  Nor were people taking it seriously when I
was getting my MFA.  As for whether class is a clumsy term, certainly.  In a
zillion ways.  However, I do think that it effects the actual look of certain
poems.  And gender may as well, but aside from sort of dull historical studies
that I've read, I don't see this currently.  I don't "see" it and would like
to have it pointed out because I like a number of women writers and often
don't understand them.  Part of the allure.

Yes, if you spoke to me of how being a woman effects your poetry you would be
answering my questions.  As for your various successes in finding my
"narratives" I can only say that while I agree whole-heartedly that I used
that language, I was doing so because I think those narratives are practiced,
played out.  Is all.  Perhaps not by anyone on this list.  But I certainly
wasn't trying to accuse everyone of having an agenda.

I'm going to go out on a limb here--as per what seems like a popular
request--and talk about how I think being a women has affected my actual
poems--and my poetic practices.

I don't think that there is much that could in any way be called
"essential" about "women's" poetry--

I think that most perceived differences are the result of cultural
factors--not "natural" ones per se.

I do think, though, that a good place to start is with something that
Alice Notley said in an essay Anselm Berrigan posted to this list two
weeks ago. In that essay, entitled "The Poetics of Disobedience," Alice
pointed out (and in a way more forceful than I can do here) that there
does in fact seem to be a strange absence of pregrnant bodies and babies
in poetry--

Has anyone else ever noticed this?

Again, this is primarily cultural--why is poetry about babies and
pregnancy taken less seriously than poetry about kings and drinking and
thinking and history?

This is just one example--but it does seem to be question that arises only
when more women begin to write.

I'm not saying this is essential to women's writing--it is, rather,
discursive, in my view.

So what about the discourse of poetry makes poems about babies and ruffles
seem garrish or precious?

What about the discourse of poetry discourages what Tannen characterizes
as women's more cooperative mode of conversation.

As in: there are a lot of ways to talk about the connection between actual
poetry and the creatures who write it (male or female) without
essentializing.....

I have been trained to avoid the passive in writing.
I have been trained to avoid the precious in writing.
I have been trained to appreciate a tradition comprised of, like, all men.

This doesn't mean that all of the history of poetry is "by nature" male or
masculinist, but it does seem to present some historical problems such as
"no babies" "no pregnancies" "no physical births"--

It also may have something to do with the injunction against passive
writing.

It also may have something to do with the notion that great writers are
also great "thinkers"--

That a great poet is someone like Olsen or Ginsburg or O'Hara--people who
led very peripatetic lives.

The traditional model seems to privelege the wandering poet--the
unattached poet--the drunken poet?

I think that being a female writer, at least for me, has forced me to call
this model into question.

These sorts of narratives, in my view, are what at least I'm talking about
when I claim a connection between being a woman and the writing I produce
as such.

I'm not saying,"gee, I'm flush with female hormones, so I must then write,
like, fluffy things" or something. I'm simply saying that there is a
connection between female narratives and at least my poetry.

Yours,
Katy

In repsonse to Mr. Don Byrd 's comment: "I was out of town for a couple of
weeks and was set to nomail.  I have been back now for a week.  I'll admit
I have found the discussions extraordinarily dreary.  The "issues" have
been of the kind that inevitably, perhaps necessarily, evoke _prescribed_
responses.  It is not a personal fault: to engage them at all is to assume
a stereotyped posture: bad-ass renegade, enforcer of righteousness,
weak-kneed liberal; I am dangerously close to being
a pretentious  voice of community good-sense, etc."

1. First of all, there was nothing presecribed in last weeks responses.  I
resent that, because I was one of those responses.  There were no
sereotypes, only individuals repsonding.  Maybe you group people under
labels, but I try not to.  Awwwwwww.... maybe you felt left out?

2. I am on the list, have spoken once (sigh....no one said much except for
some snide commentsabout a pot holder in a printer, which promptly shut me
down) however, after yesterday's comments about the dreariness of the last
week of posts, I am likely pot-boiling, not pot holding.  Comments such as
these are just so depressing when I was actually enjoying what I was
reading -- so many interesting stories and attitudes (the woman who built a
room in her own back yard, the "woman-in-court" jury story that I felt was
contentious and the responses to which were varied and assertively
'male-trying-to-be-pro-feminist-and-angry-for-not-being-praised-as-such'
(this is just my take, but I am not condemining so much as commenting that
I was enjoying the different view points... good thinking material all in
all).  What does Mr. Byrd's comment about not writing what has already been
written say about anything really?  Everything has been said, we only make
it different by bringing anything -- criticism, poetry, art -- into our
lives and illuminating it and MAKING IT NEW through our own individual take
on... whatever.
(I am typing madly before running off to class, so please forgive any
errors, grammatical or othewise).
2. Now this sort of sweeping generalization about the posts, along with
that terrible series of percentages on female vs male vilence were just...
sigh... what am I doing tapping into this unpoetic... oh I don't know...
agrh!  (There! a 'shrill' uncontolled woman fer you!).  So I am signing off
from Canada now.
And Mr. Byrd: Plougshares, not pens (penises?... sorry , I couldn't
resist), are the answer -- sorry, but most people don't have time to sit
atop a wordsworthian hill and spout poetry in third world counties -- I
don't even have enought time to do it!

>All I know is that it isn't on the shelves around here.



but this is a limited measure, referring only (really) to money and hardly
fit to determine a poetry's character; you'd not find Lyly, Akenside,
Young, Campion, Thomson, Bowles, Churchill, Cibber, Waller or even
Skelton or Bunting on many shelves, this is not by any significant
necessity a measure of their marginality, it just depends whether you're
in the know and if so which knows it is you're in.  Thomson eg was
the most popular and well-read poet of his age.  There are qualities in
verse which can be internally perfected even while socially latent; not
every characteristic depends on discovery in order to matter.


not being on the shelves is, I think, too readily a keyphrase to a vaguely
leftist fetishism, the default arousal of which serves principally to
obscure real differences and commitments.  Maybe.

     In art I'm a miniature abstractionist (my hands are normal size
though) and when I'm reading and need to mark one of those "good points,"
all that really matters to me is the margin being just the right size,
and the paper the right texture for the pen I'm holding. But when I cut
the page out of Derrida's "Structure, Sign, and Play" to frame and
show and get famous, anxiety rose, and that night my blankets were cold
crackling paper. Preserved within a biography of Theodore Roethke are
my best works of the year 1985 (this for the catalog essay). And my
hands are warm and wet with newspaper ink, my language transparent.

some threads relevant to topics discussed recently:



                        The Poetics of Disobedience

                        by Alice Notley


        For a long time I've seen my job as bound up with the necessity of
non-compliance with pressures, dictates, atmospheres of, variously, poetic
factions, society at large, my own poetic practices as well. For a long time
-- well in fact since the beginning, since I learned how to be a poet inside
the more rebellious more outlawish wing of poetry; though learning itself
meant a kind of obedience, so like most words the Dis words, the Dis form,
cannot be worshipped either -- and that would be an obedience anyway. I've
spoken in other places of the problems, too, of subjects that hadn't been
broached much in poetry and how it seemed one had to disobey the past and
the practices of literary males in order to talk aboutwhat was going on most
literarily around one, the pregnant body, and babies for examples. There
were no babies in poetry then. How could that have been? What are we leaving
out now? Usually what's exactly in front of the eyes ears nose and mouth, in
front of the mind, but it seems as if one must disobey everyone else in
order to see at all. This is a persistent feeling in a poet but staying
alert to all the ways that one is coerced into denying experience, sense and
reason is a huge task. I recently completed a very long poem called
Disobedience but I didn't realize that disobeying was what I was doing, what
perhaps I'd always been doing until the beginning of the end of it, thought
the tone throughout was one of rejection of everything I was supposed to be
or to affirm, all the poetries all the groups the clothes the gangs the
governments the feelings and reasons.
        I seem to start with my poem The Descent Of Alette these days,
whatever it is that I am now seems to start there. It was for me an immense
act of rebellion against dominant social forces, against the fragmented
forms of modern poetry, against the way a poem was supposed to look
according to both past and contemporary practice. It begins in pieces and
ends whole, narrated by an I who doesn't know her name and whose name when
she finds it means appendage of a male name; her important name is I. I
stand with this, and with the urgency that saying I creates, a facing up to
sheer presence, death and responsibility, the potential for blowing away all
the gauze. In two subsequent narrative poem/proses, Close to me...& Closer
(The Language of Heaven) and Desamere I felt myself pushing against ideas of
reality as soley what's visible and in what shapes and colors it's said to
be visible, against the idea that religion is solely an organized affair,
against the pervasive idea that one must not protest what everyone else has
named the Actual -- how can you fight Reality? -- against the psychology of
belonging, of aiding and abetting. Desamere especially is about not wanting
to belong and the process of cesing to belong to the extent that's possible.
All three of thoseworks are characterized by emphatic though variable
metrical patterns, in the prose as well as the poetry parts; two are very
quirky as to physical presentation; all three have narratives that tend to
the fabular.
        In a book that will soon be published, Mysteries of Small Houses, I
was firstly trying to realize the first person singular as fully and nakedly
as possible, saying "I" in such a way as to make myself really nervous,
really blowing away the gauze and making myself too scared of life and death
to care what anyone thought of me or what I was going to say. Saying I in
that way I tried to trace that I's path through my past. In a more
subsidiary way I decided to go against my own sense that certain styles and
forms I'd participated in formerly might be used up, that autobiography was,
that the personal-sounding I (as opposed to the fictional I) might be,
against the rumor that there's no self, though I've never understood that
word very well and how people use it now in any of the camps that use it pro
or con -- I guess I partly wrote Mysteries in order to understand it better.
I came to the conclusion, in the final poem of the book, that self means 'I'
and also means 'poverty,' it's what one strips down to, who you are when
you've stripped down.
        It's possible that my biggest act of disobedience has consistently,
since I was an adolescent, been agianst the idea that all truth comes from
books, relaly other people's books. I hate the fact that whatever I say or
wrote, someone reading or listening will try to find something out of their
reading I "sound like". 'You sound just like...' 'you remind me of...' 'have
you read...?' I read all the time and I often believe what I read while I'm
reading it, especially if it's some trashy story; intense involvement in
theories as well as stories seems difficult without temporary belief, but
then it burns out. I've been trying to train myself for thirty or forty
years not to believe anything anyone tells me. Not believing, the, became th
crux of Disobedience, which is my most recent completed book. Not believing
and telling the truth as it comes up. One of the main elements in the poem
is an ongoing fantasy in which the I, who is pretty much I, keeps company
and converses with a man very much like the actor Robert Mitchum and that of
course is not strictly believable. On the other hand it's fun, and it stands
for something a sort of truth, about how we do have stories going on in our
consciousness and unconsciousness all the time and about how we're always
talking to some "you" mentally. I wouldn't expect you to take this book as
the truth, I would expect you to go with it, given that you like to read. I
find the act of reading puzzling at the moment, since in a book I've been
working on since Disobedience I ask the reader to read despite the fact that
I'm not really entertaining the reader or being clear in any of the
traditional ways I can think of. I think books may imply a readership that
simply likes to read, which may sound obvious but it's something I myself
have only just thought of. But back to Disobedience. It asks the reader to
read a lot of pages, about 230 A-4 pages in verse, but it's fairly easy to
read and it makes a lot of jokes. I't's very feminist but men seem to enjoy
it a lot, it possibly contains a rather virile approach to things riding
roughshod and shooting  at every little duck that seems to pop up. As I
implied earlier, Disobedience didn't exactly set out to be disobedient; it
set out actually to try to do the kinds of things I'd previously done in
differnet poems all in the same poem, that is tell a story, interact with
the so-called visible or phenomenal the despised daily, and explore the
unconscious. But it got more and more pissed off as it confronted the
political from an international vantage, dealt with being awoman in France,
turning fifty and being apoet and thus seemingly despised or at least
ignored. The title popped up in a dream, a real dream I had towards the end
of writing the work, in connection with a comic poet I know: it was the
title of his book in the dream and I realized later that there was probably
nothing more disobedient than being a comic poet, since no one's ever sure
if that's good enough, particularly the academy unless you've been dead
since the 14th century or unless you've also written a lot of tragedies. I
myself wouldn't want the limitation of being only one kind of poet, but I
realize this comic business is something to think about. But more and more
as I wrote Disobedience I discovered I couldn't go along, with the
government or governments, with radicals and certianly nor conservatives or
centrists, with radical poetics and certainly not with other poetics, with
other women's feminisms, with any fucking thing at all; belonging  to any of
it was not only an infringement on my liberty but a veil over clear thinking.
        It's necessary to maintain a stae of disobedience
against...everything. One must remain somehow, though how, open to any
subject or form in principle, open to the possibility of liking, open to the
possibility of using. I try to maintain no continuous restrictions in my
poetics except with regard to particular works, since writing at all means
making some sort of choices. But NO DOCTRINES. Rather I tend to maintain a
sense that a particular form or sets of rules at a certain point might serve
me for a while. Like may writers I feel ambivalentabout words, I know they
don't work, I know they aren't it. I don't in the least feel that everything
is language. I have a sense that there has been language from the beginning,
that it isn't fundamentally an invention. These are contradictory positions
but positions are just words. I don't believe that the best poems are just
words, I think they're the same as reality; I tend to think reality is
poetry, and that that isn't words. But words are one way to get at
reality/poetry, what we're in all the time. I think words are among us and
everything else, mingling, fusing with, backing off from us and everything else.
        Since Disobedience I've been working on this other thing which isn't
as friendly as Dis is, though it isn't meant to be unfreindly. It's just
hard to read, in that you have to decide to sit down and read it word by
word giving each word the rhythm and weight it requires. Taht sounds like
poetry but this one tends to be long in blowy sentences all down the page. I
am going at several ideas at once: one is that the world is intensely
telepathic, infused with the past and continual thought of all the living
and all the dead. I started out with that idea adn with the idea of a
Byzantince church as a sort of head, mine, full of icons and mosaics on ever
expanding and shifting walls. But the church or head got bigger and bigger
and more and more full of images and words until it expanded into a city. So
at the moment, on page one hundred and something, I'm dealing with the idea
that there are tow cities or worlds at the same time, an ideal crystalline
one and the supposedly real one. Generally I'm neither all the way in one
nor the other, though sometimes it seems as if I'm nowhere near the crystal
one and its resonable opulence so I start beating hard at all the doors I
can find in my mind. Then sometimes it seems as if the supposedly real world
just isn't there or here at all though I know if I stop typing and go
outside it will get me. This work is also very disobedient, in a way it
picks up where Disobedience left off; but it doesn't lecture as much or
shake its fist so, is less interested in the so-called real than in denying
its existence in fafor of the real real. You can't fly unless you're not on
the ground and this one really flies sometimes.
        I think I conceive of myself as disobeying my readrship a lot. I
began the new work in fact denying their existence; it seemed to me I needed
most at this point to work on my own existence so I couldn't afford to cater
to them if they got in the way of my finding out things. But this is a work
of mine, it should be published sometime. I'm now in a predicament I can't
get out of, a form I can't manage for the reader, which just keeps leading
me on and leading me on. It's predicated on leaving in as much mind fuzz as
possible, that is being open to all that it out there in telepathy -- not a
very organizeable entity, the entity. Too wordy, too long; and I've allowed
in a lot of notions from my dreams again, have allowed odd images to take on
the weight of truth; and I'm stubbornly involved again in what you might
call mystical conceptions, but aren't those a nono? Except in icky New Age
territory, yuck. The reader likes you to tell him/her what he/she already
knows in a fmailiar form whether in mainstreamese or avant-gardese, but then
there is the individual reader who is often not like that at all, who
prefers poems to talking about them and has strange individual experiences
with them. That's a very scary idea. It's possible that the reader, or maybe
the ideal reader, is a very disobedient person a head/church/city entity
her/himself full of soring icons and the words of all the living and all the
dead, who sees and listens to it all and never lets on that there's all this
beautiful almost undifferentiation inside, everything  equal and almost
undemarcated in the light of fundamental justice. And poker-faced puts up
with the outer forms. As I do a lot of the time but not so much when I'm
writing.

maybe an interesting thread - what -are- the poems about babies, or in
which babies figure cameo-wise?  They do always seem to be pretty
strategic, occasions for abstruser musings as is Coleridge's in 'Frost at
Midnight'..  Larkin crapped out a fairly dour bit re: Kingsley Amis' new
bairn.  Actually Prynne has a few concerns swimming about in his new
_For The Monogram_ (BUY), there's a line (if I recall) something like:

Lactation adds up to just this, sorted fashion cribs.

also in _Her Weasels Wild Returning_ (nicely mentioned in William Fuller's
new book), "saving the infant a place ahead in her mission grab to repair
both."

Doug Oliver's _The Infant and the Pearl_? _Pearl_?  There's the narrative
in book nine I think it is, in The Prelude, where the young Frenchman

I think there is that element in it, to some amount having some effects on
all poets. Some of the strands of thought, on that same subject, that I have
come upon, run roughly as follows.....

Poetry, by its very nature, is always considered to be disobedient, by some.
It is often considered, by some, to be irresponsible use of language. Prose,
on the other hand, is deemed more business-like in its demands and its
declarations.

Prose is considered less emotional, even when it makes statements about
emotions. Poetry is considered more emotional, even when it is not about
emotions. This might be a false perception, but it is a common perception
as to the prosaic and the poetic.

Emotions are not business-like, not conducive to calculative precision,
and that some believe that all emotions ought to be eradicated, tends to
transfer the same attitude toward poetics. Particularly towards romantic
poetics, as opposed to political or philosophical poetics.

Prose tends to follow more clearly defined and definable grammatical and
syntactical regulations much more closely. At least it appears to do so, to
many, sometimes overly simplistic, viewpoints. The regulations defining what
constitutes a proper sentence of prose are relatively easy to communicate
compared to the very complicated requirements as to a line of good poetry.

Prose viewed as a technical, applied, science, and poetry as an art.

Prose tends to be viewed, by some loud voices, as more appropriately
pragmatic, whereas poetry is then denied that fundamental characteristic of
the word used as short declarative sentence of command and acknowledgement
of command.

Prose is, to some ways of thinking, more apparently technical, and claims a
precision of meaning that it often lacks. Poetry is denied a greater
precision of meaning that it often actually has. If prose is a work horse,
then poetry is a wild stallion or a wild mare.

Prose is viewed as integrative and poetry as dis-integrative. Some tend
therefore to associate prose with sanity and poetry with insanity.

Prose can be viewed as totalistic and closed, whereas poetry could be viewed
as being more anarchic and open. Some see that as dis-favourable.

Prose more often follows the line, fills the space from clearly prescribed
margin to clearly prescribed margin. Poetry breaks up the space more randomly,
and declares itself opposed to such clearly prescribed margins. Poetry often
defies punctuation.

Some believe that prose tends to be more explicit and so vouchsafes more
carefulness in saying, and occults certain ideas that they feel ought never
to be spoken of. Poetry, on the other hand, is believed to tend to reveal by
means of implication, allusion, and indirectly. While in fact prose might do
similarly, and often does, the false perception as to the Luciferian nature
of poetry as opposed to prose is a strata in the tradition.

More prose tends to maintain the most common usage, for the more common
purposes, and therefore is often more conservative. Poetry tends to push a
word to the limits of its meaning, and stretch the boundaries of what is
sayable.
Prose often imposes silence, whereas poetry often gives voice.

I am sure there are more and similar observations of various attitudes.
Some held as cherished beliefs only by a very few, and some more widely held
to as being true, even if many such are purely subjective prejudices....

Responding to McColl's query about the personal in contemporary poetics.
There are some, like, pretty clear historical reasons why the personal is
no longer in vogue.  There are also many more very unclear but slightly
discernible and sometimes comprehensible reasons for this -- but as to
whether they can be quickly/easily articulated here is another Q.  I'll
give it a shot.

The guy who "started" the first creative writing programs back in the
1920s, Hughes Mearns, insisted that creative writing -- and poetry
especially -- was the best means of, as he put it, "transmitting
experience" from individual to individual. (See his two books of, I think
1925 and 1929, _Creative Youth_ and _Creative Power_). His assumption
(which was basically a misprision of Deweyean social theory) was that we
are each an isolato.  Certain cultural trends in America toward the end of
the 19C had seriously impacted and drasticallly altered the ideas
Americans had held about language and civic life, and these, coupled with
some poor readig of Dewey, led Mearns to hold some very weird and very
interestig ideas. And for reasons that aren't really clear, Mearns gave
_poetry_ -- much moreso than prose -- the dubious honor of carrying this
cross of the personal (the historical reasons for this are so numerous and
many-sided that it, like, makes my head spin). Anyway, the point is that
since Mearns (whose progressivist influence on national public education
was in many ways as strong as, well, Horace Mann's), the personal in
poetry has taken flak for becoming on the one hand Solipsistic (see
everybody here from dear old Fred Chappell to, I don't know, the mandarin
rantings of Derek Walcott) and on the other Passe (been there, done that,
time to move on, let's let Berryman be Berryman and Berrigan be Berrigan
-- and the, like, tropes of personal sincerity are exhausted anyway etc
etc). So, in the eyes of some, then, "personal," as a historical cultural
and poetic contruct has, like, had its day.

If you want a nice gloss on Mearns' role in the institutional Hx of
"creative writing" in America, read the by now increasingly well-known
book by D.G. Myers, _The Elephants Teach: Creative Writing Since 1880_
(Prentice Hall, 1996).  Myers, you may know, is lately a student of Gerald
Graff at Northwestern.  The book is a drastically pared down version of
his diss.  Though providing an intellectual history of the creative
writing movement is not Myers' explicit intent, he does give a rather
left-handed and implicit history of the idea of "personal experience" and
American poetics.

What there is no doubt about, in tersm of the institutional history, is
that the "transfer of experience" (the personalism) was affiliated more
closely with poetry than with prose.  Certainly the rise of prose poetry,
when viewed in this light, looks, from a historian's pt of view, REALLY
interesting.

So there are some pretty strong historical (cultural and institutional)
reasons for it.  One upshot we're all familiar with is that Poetry is more
and more being considered -- at least by the kinds of poets who subscribe
to a list like this -- as (after IA Richards) phatic language. That is to
say, like, Empty. Hence maybe here the rise of prose poetry: the attempt
to be "realer," less, like, solipsistic etc etc.  Dashed off, sorry.

Katy--Belle Waring in Dark Blonde has very explicitly physical
stuff about birth--and doctors who fuck up in a shocking way.
It's in a kind of documentary mode, though, and *as poetry* would
probably be rejected by most people on this list as too traditional.
I think the appearance of certain subject matter tends to correlate
with a use of language seen as not always problematic in the way
it represents the world.  Yet had her language been opaque, references
cryptic, she oculd not have accomplished a very powerful occupation and
domination of cultural space formerly denied to her. I understand the ex-
tensive and persuasive rationale(s) for various experimental poetries; I
appreciate the rationales and I write the poetry. But I've sometimes

disagree with what has seemed like a strict proscription of content
understandable in the usual way--as if to say that experimental poetry
is the only poetry that has validity, that other uses of language
in poetry are inevitably naive and retrograde. Which has seemed odd to
me since in discussions of this sort various discourses and language
games are used as though they work, at least provisionally or on an
ad hoc basis---the way more traditional poetry is also written.

NEW YORK (March 24) - You've come a long way, comrade.

A stylish new edition of ''The Communist Manifesto'' aims to make Karl
Marx and Friedrich Engels the latest in radical chic.

The slender volume is being republished as a glossy, $13 hardcover for
release in New York and London on May Day. The fashionable department
store Barneys is thinking about it for a window display.

The publisher says the 1848 work speaks to a sense on Wall Street that
the
party can't go on forever.

''There's a sense of anxiety tied to the millennium. People don't
believe
things will just carry on, with markets rising forever,'' says Colin
Robinson, head of Verso publishers, which is printing 20,000 copies on
the
150th anniversary of the manifesto. ''Marx's description of a capitalist
system prone to shocks and convulsions captures that mood.''

The revolutionary book, now with a rippling red-flag cover, has become
fodder for capitalist fantasy:

With a handle attached, the book could make a snazzy accessory to a
designer dress, says Simon Doonen, creative director of Barneys on
Madison
Avenue. One could sashay toward the new millennium, the 19th-century
words
of Marx and Engels dangling at one's side.

Doonan is toying with the idea of featuring the ''Manifesto'' - along
with
red lipsticks - in the window as ''conceptual art.'' His assistants are
looking for the right lipstick - preferably with a Russian-sounding
name.

With communism gasping around the world, ''it's OK to look at the book
as
camp,'' he says.

Around Wall Street, the very capital of capitalism, the Borders
bookstore
at the World Trade Center plans to give the book center display in the
front of the store. Barnes & Noble will likewise market the
''Manifesto''
at its 483 superstores as ''a storefront feature.''

''Enough time has passed since the fall of the Iron Curtain so Marxism
can
again be seen as a utopian philosophy,'' says John Kulka, a Barnes &
Noble
merchandise manager.

The new edition was designed by two trendy, Soviet-born, New York
artists
known as Komar and Melamid. With crimson end pages and a ribbon marker
of
the same color, ''it's elegant enough to grace a coffee table,''
Robinson
says.

That's not quite what its authors had in mind.

Written during the Industrial Revolution, the ''Manifesto'' called the
working class to arms against the bourgeoisie.

The ''Manifesto'' opens with the famous words, ''A spectre is haunting
Europe - the spectre of Communism.'' It predicted that a catastrophic
cycle of booms and busts would befall the new free-market system.

The 23-page pamphlet was ''the most influential single piece of
political
writing since the French Revolution,'' historian Eric Hobsbawm, the
intellectual guru of Britain's socialists, writes in the introduction to
the new, 96-page edition.

The Communist Party U.S.A., which is based in New York and claims 25,000
members, could use a little marketing.

''Cool,'' spokeswoman Terrie Albano says. ''It wasn't too long ago when
everyone was saying communism was dead. Here it is, resurrected.''

I would like more information on the women's writing workshop(s) mentioned:

How is the process different from another workshop?

Does the "background" subject matter of a writing workshop make a difference?
The sex of the participants?  The stated "topic" or focus?

How is the writing different from another workshop or from feminist writing?
Is a women's writing workshop different from a feminist writing workshop?

Writing this just made me remember:  I took a lot of "lessons" as a kid:  they
were all single sex.  I was in a co-ed school.  Just struck me odd:  all the
sports teams except for cross country were single sex, too, so I guess it's
pretty common, co-ed classes, single sex extracirricular activities.

I could say lots of things here, Nada, but, first of all, my workshop isn't
a women's workshop.  It's mixed, but basically queer, meaning lots of gay
men and women of a variety of pursuasions, though most of the women I know
in their 20s claim some sort of bisexuality, if only psychological, like
one "straight" woman said to me last week, "I used to have such a crush on
Jocelyn Saidenberg."  Straight guys have been in the group and worked out
very well, but I always interview them first, my main question being, "Can
you deal with overt sexual descriptions by gay men and women?"  Any
straight guy that's willing to sit through descriptions of butt-fucking is
usually going to be okay.  Many people have taken the workshop because they
wanted to work on sex writing in a serious way, writing that they wouldn't
feel comfortable taking to a college workshop.  Though at the moment, the
group is quite tame in that area.  I haven't had much of a problem with
males dominating the group and I've had very little difficulty creating a
warm, sharing, but very productive space with serious feedback, not just
compliments.  The writing varies from "experimental" to conventional and
it's officially a prose workshop.  I'm more rigid about it being a prose
workshop these days because once I let three young poets in who refused to
write prose the whole time they were there and gave off unpleasant vibes
that the prose writers were somehow inferior and the whole experience
didn't meet their high (read "immature") intellectual standards.  That
workshop I hated and I haven't allowed any poets in unless they commit to
writing prose.  Though, actually, one of my people now is bringing in some
interesting poetry at times.  I try to be non-authoritarian and create a
non-competitive environment and everybody gets lots of close readings of
their work and people's work improves--like some conceptual "I get it"
happens and their approach to language changes.  Kevin K. takes the
workshop as a student, bringing his own work in each week to be
critiqued--he's such an excellent editor, and his giving feedback as
another student, not a "teacher," is wonderful.

As far as women's workshops go, I don't see why there couldn't be a good
one if you had women coming from the same place.  I haven't been in a
women's workshop since the early 80s, and I had not very good experiences
in them.  When I first came here I got involved in the Women's Writer's
Guild, and the writing responses there were dopey as you describe, but many
of the women were quite well off, living in Marin and the East Bay and I'd
just moved to San Francisco from Chicago and I was amazed at all these hot
tubs I was sitting around naked in discussing feminism and writing, I
thought it was just great how all these women writers have hot tubs in
their homes.  Sadly, I now know no one with a hot tub.  The hot tubs are
the main thing I miss about no longer being a feminist.

I also took Kathleen Fraser's Feminist Poetics class and women's writing
workshop at SF State and those were very useful, rigorous, enlightening.
When the class ended Kathleen urged the women from the women's workshop to
continue a group on their own, which happened.  At that point I was still
writing poetry and clearly there was a struggle going on between what I
wanted to do in writing and formal issues in poetry.  I hadn't yet figured
out you could write prose without writing short stories.  But, as soon as
the women's workshop no longer had Kathleen as a facilitator, it turned
vicious in its hierarchical reorganization, with the wanna-be language
poets (none of which are on the scene any more) at the top, and then the
tolerated in-betweens, and me at the bottom.  The queen of the workshop
told me that I was writing about sex and violence and therefore should go
into therapy.  I remember yelling back that I wasn't writing about sex and
violence.  I had sex on page two and violence on page 4--that's not sex and
violence!  Remember, this was the early 80s, it wasn't yet cool to write
about sex and violence and anything narrative was the scum of the earth.

I was moved when Johanna Drucker read at Small Press Traffic a couple of
weeks ago and she talked about her interest in narrative when she was
growing up, how she'd always imagined herself writing huge narrative books.
Then she fell in with the Bay Area scene and was told that that wasn't
valid, so she developed other strategies in writing.  She spoke of how she
was still struggling with this "self-censorship."  I often wonder the same
things about my own work.

I see so much competiveness and turf guarding among women writers, it can
be very depressing.  I think some of the people who are railing about
inequalities with men should think about being nicer to the women they
know.  And this isn't aimed at you, Gordon, I have no idea how you are to
the women you know.

Keston:

 "not being on the shelves" is no less a key phrase than someone saying that
at "my" m.f.a. program people are very interested in experimental poetry.  I'm
surprised to find that there is all this resistance to the notion that outside
elite academies, poetry is marginalized, and experimental poetry more so.  Is
it startling to anyone that here in LA we have these readings sponsored by
various national poetry organizations where people like Stephen Dunn are put
out as the great poets because "they have a vision of the middle class" as was
recently said at a reading here.  As always, I'm a little put off by the
pedantic tone on this list.

Katy:  No offense, but no one is askig you or me to make an essentialist
argument about what is women's poetry.

I think I find it troubling that on this list people tend to try to posture
themselves and direct there arguments in pedagogical terms.  Which words like
"discursive" can be.  I'd like to believe that this list was a space where
communication could take place with an understanding that it is taking place
in a zone or similiar "interpretative community."

Very interesting these remark on maternity and the "training" that you
recieved.

Back to the other note:  I still think shelf space counts.  When you see
people outside the academy looking for a language they can think it and they
go to the store and Scalapino is not on the shelf or is buried under 27
volumes of Robert Hass, this has an effect.

I am just getting through reading about six weeks of posts, two days
more to go before I'm clear.  I am gearing up for a belated contribution
on the gender thing.  Rachel and Katy--you rock.

I was just so glad to read this with all the knee jerk press analysis
and no one talking about repression and denial (of the very goods
marketed/flaunted all in front of your face).  Though perhaps there is
some hope via resisitance.  Friend Akilah Oliver says that since the
activism/press exposure of Nike's repression of labor, Nike sales are
down by half.

To have a better sense of Don Byrd's concerns people on the list should
read his book, The Poetics of the Common Knowledge. I have recently
finished it. The intellectual history he draws on is vast including
modernist literature, philosophy, science and technology, and more
recent and radical departures such as autopoesis and recursive systems.
Its not only an enormously literate and erudite work but for this long
time anchorite/student of Western intellectual history it is a tight
discourse which draws on fundamental texts and proposes a program of
poetics and aesthetics that should be more widely considered and
debated.--Carlo Parcelli

Of course some poetries get good journalism and of course it's usually
because they give good journalism, are middle-class (though everything
here is) etc, lots of good stuff is not well known (believe me - the
academies are no exception, or this one isn't anyhow), BUT: I am trying to
look a little more closely at the semiologic range of 'marginal', the
politics of literary identity that it incites or that it can potentially
incite, the kinds of decision made regarding its values as a description
and the implied values of the work so described, the extent to which the
term and what it designates have already been appropriated and fetishized
commercially, etc.  It's not pedantic to attempt thoroughness, it's
myopic to arrest one's judgement of a situation with whichever explanation
seems most ready to glorify one's status.

Hi Standard,

Points well-taken.

Just to clarify something: I don't mean to say "my" mfa program is any
sort of touchstone per se--

It just happens to be the place from which I'm coming from right now.

I am, admittedly, pretty academic in my concerns. My father and sister
both hold advanced degrees in linguistics and I have led an extremely
academic life thus far (which I think will change when I leave this
place...).

___

As per the issue of essentialism. I don't think that anyone here is
necessarily demanding an essentialist reading of "women's poetry." But I
do think that the line between essentialist and historical readings of
any "sort" of poetry is all too often blurred.

The following quote speaks well to this concern:

A truth, it must be admitted, is not easy to recognize, once it has become
accepted. Not that there are established truths, but they then become so
easily confused with the reality that surrounds them that no other
artifice has yet been found to distinguish them from it than to mark them
with the sign of the spirit, to pay them homage, to regard them as coming
from another world.

(Lacan, Ecrits, "The Freudian Thing," p. 120, Norton 1977)--

---

As per the character of Dodie's workshops. I took one of her workshops
oh... maybe three years ago.

I thought it was really terrific. As she says, there was a lot of variety
of all sorts in my particular group--different sexualities, genders,
ideas, goals etc...

I remember being completely refreshed by it as it was pretty much the
first time I had actually encountered "intellectuals" outside of an
academic environment.

The students and the writing were totally impressive and interesting to
me.

One friend (a poet, I suppose) brought in sound collages, which were fun
to hear. Another woman was working on a very strange novel. I believe
(correct me if I remember incorrectly Dodie) that her protagonist was
supposed to be ungendered or somehow ambiguous?

I remember that her work challenged narrative in a really provocative way.

One guy was writing about a kind of nutty gay man who moved through an
equally nutty art world--paintings were stolen, blackmail was
attempted--all of it happened within a highly sexualized milieu.

Kevin K was working on a wonderfully sharp piece--

It treated the AIDS epeidemic with a light yet maccabre sort of humor--

As in: it portrayed its characters as just getting on with things, in
spite of but also with a deep regard for the dead who still haunted the
SF landscape of the period depicted....

And there was another woman (a regular, I believe) who was writing these
strange pieces about a movie critic? (Dodie?)--she was a journalist
herself in "real" life.....

Anyway--just taking this opportunity to refresh my memory of it--

I thought it was a really productive workshop--and I didn't feel any
tension or any sense of competition or disapproval on anyone's
part...

Best,
Katy

given the messages, part of whose subject is 'guns' lately, I thought I'd

While not necessarily, or usually, supportive of such grand gestures, I

ONE DAY IN PEACE, JANUARY 1, 2000.
 This is a 24-hour concept where no guns are fired anywhere on earth..
 including on television.  What if, for 24 hours, whosoever happens to be at
 war on December 31st, 1999, agrees that for one whole day no guns would be
 fired?  The silence would be golden.

 And what if the television programmers of the world agreed to not air any
 programming with a violent content?  (It would probably be easier to get
 warring nations to stop firing than it would be to get the world's television
 programmers to not air violent programming.)

 At present, this ONE DAY IN PEACE concept is beginning to get further
 circulation.  On April 6, 1997, there were 1000 days until January 1, 2000.

 This is a thought-wave campaign.  Which is to say, the more people who grasp
 this thought, the more it comes into reality..

 One Day In Peace, January 1, 2000..pass it on..expect a miracle.

The other side of the coin, though, comes from Wittgenstein, who wrote that
the truth can only be known by standing outside of the world. Lacan, I guess,
is speaking as a nominalist.  Wittgenstein (if he admits the possibility of
such an "outside" perspective), as a realist.  This outsider position relates
to the "status" of marginality.  The broken off splinter reveals the
macrocosm.  Synecdoche.

you must know Williams's White Mule. the baby is terrific, it's one of the
great things to read I want chucked in my grave.

Here is a poem I wrote a long time ago about a baby:

HAPPY BABY

In the park in a carriage
Dressed like (a little) your mother
The sun speaks to you
And you talk back
So fast the sun says
"I'm sorry?" your sister a concerto
Scowls over you
Smiling
Your head leaning this
Way and that



and thank you for sending at the motel partial opportunity it is lovely
looking I will read it as soon as I get some food in me. I had my students
write for a solid half hour today and they did rebel, god's wounds!

Also in the mail today the Alex Smith Jr. book Bill Luoma mentioned. It is
lovely and sad just what I needed today when it is so hot out.

I wonder what anybody wants.

Hey two of my students are reading at Town Hall in this poet laureate
project of read your favorite poem. So have mercy on the project, please.

I would only go along with it if the pages decomposed in roughly the way
lettuce does. IT would be symbollic of the life expectancy of the current
work of art.

Imagine pages that change colour slowly, then begin to slime, and rot,
right before your very eyes, after the plastic wrapper is taken off and
activates a special ingredient within the vacuum pack.

You have only three days to read this book...after opening the wrapper.
You can extend the keeping qualities to as long as one week,in the vegetable
compartment of your household refrigerator.

P.S. This could be bigger than "pet rocks" and sieze a larger market niche

Actually I should have mentionned that guns are much too messy.
They are also terribly old fashioned. There have to be better ways.

In this final twilight of the 20th century, coming into the 21st century,
and progressing beyond Buck Rogers, we ought to be able to kill nearly
anything with one single THOUGHT....

So that is what must be so dangerous about poets....They think too much.
Sometimes, even worse, they give voice to what they think.

After plotting the coup attempt, your next electronic mail arrives and says
something to the effect that:

For attempting a poetic coup of a listserv your poetic license is revoked
for a period not less than five years for each instance of standing out as
an individual and recognizable poetic voice....all such sentences to be
served consecutively.

That's it. Poetic license revoked. No appeal. Simply revoked.

Mark--

The gist of this passage may have been a "truism" for 300 years--

But I think you forget the context from which it has been plucked--

As in: Lacan's view of "reality" and its relation to the subject.

Yours,

which is why: when an autocratic gov takes over the poets are usually among
the first killed. tendencies in history are fun, and aparently deadly.

I thought Dodie's post terrificly important in many ways.

Here is where I am on this thread: "stories heal" (I wrote that
earlier). Stories also terrify.

Even every poet has a story...

(whether or not that story gets told, whether or not the poet wants it
to leak through the words ...

To second how Katty has read Lacan, some of what I mean by story hovers
among the words, alongside the "language" that censors as well as
constructs how we tell or hear those stories--

one aspect of caring for language is in lending an ear to such stories
(stories now from different people, different ethnicities, sexualities
...

another picks at the inadequacies and incoherences that a deconstruction
reveals

Or am I being so "biunivocular" that I should have myself carted away?

I never thought this latter care an end in itself--only a way to
supplement the first?

a problem i see with this is: comformity is impossible. any attempt to
comform is done thru your perceptions, etc. and so whatever you are
attempting to conform to becomes your own, whether or not you intend that.
so: to automatically make some arbitary descision about disbelief or belief
(to pre-judge) before you know the ideas and/or arguments of the
individual/group will limit your growth as an individual because of the lack
of exposure to others due to your closed mind.

Kind of wierd to tune in after a few days and find a thread I found =
interesting & provocative getting strangely bogged down?? And what is =
this bizarre list of statistics? It reminds me when that study came out =
that a woman had about much chance of getting married after--what was =
it, 30??--as being captured by a terrorist. Now I feel like I'm helping =
to "silence" men who have been abused by their wives and girlfriends, =
and I'm sure that such abuse happens, the human race being such as it =
is, but I can't believe in greater amounts than women being abused!=20

I feel like I need to defend that there is sexism in the world and back =
that up with various stories I have seen, heard and experienced. And it =
definitely happens in how we're taught reading and writing, in both the =
classroom and out. Although I try to keep myself as sensitized as =
possible, doing counts of everything to try and make it 50/50 men/women, =
last night I was asked who my biggest influences were. I automatically =
reeled off 2 male writers, then had to consciously think, I must now =
include 2 women writers. My first impulse was to name men, even though =
the women have been just as big influences. When my "affirmative action" =
becomes automatic & unconscious, then maybe I won't need to talk about =
it so much. However, since this thread started, I've definitely become =
more involved with reading the list and feel more comfortable about =
responding.=20

Here is one study I vaguely remember reading about: Two groups were =
given the same piece of writing but with two different names: one =
female, one male. When asked if they thought it was a good piece of =
writing, the "female" group said (mostly) no. The "male" group said =
(mostly) yes. If anyone has info on this study, I'd like to verify. =20

I think it would be interesting to have a  more precise discussion of =
gender and poetry--ESPECIALLY experimental poetry. I've disagreed with =
Irigaray that women write with their vaginas (but maybe the movement =
from pen to keyboard means something ...) But Helene Cixous's theories =
on a female language are interesting when applied to experimental =
syntax. Perhaps we could talk about Alice Notley's work?=20

the cherry blossom is a complicated bloom. with all its social hopes at
the tidal basin. tourists and a western rapproachment. global economy. a
tea ceremony of geo-political importance in the margins of 'yen' and
'dollar'.

I walked up tilden the other day. sleeping in the park, because the park
divides. and divisions, distinctions are important.

the cop-man told the homeless man with the spotlight in his eye before
sunrise that he'd have-ta move on. move on.

the cherry blossoms is bluumin'.

i love *this* spring. but i prefer that bullshit daffodil. cherry
blossoms be damned. photosynthesis and all that civic-life. fake, it
seems.

love, and boys and girls and things.

Dodie

Thanks so much for the detailed response.  Your workshop sounds great and I
wish I could be part of it, although I haven't written narrative (except
letters)seriously since I was 18.  I began writing fairly normal stories
about love betrayals and the like, but found myself bored by their
literalness (although they were well-liked by my teacher and felllow
students in a fiction workshop I took at Merritt college).  I started
putting in dream sequences and then cut out the rest of the story; only the
dream sequences felt powerful to me.  My teacher and classmates were no
longer generous in their praise, but seemed befuddled.  I wanted to be
ambiguous and transcendent of logic and combine words more
aurally/physically.  That desire could have harked back to my childhood
reading and constant rereading of Alice and Rutabaga stories, or my teenage
anarchic punk explosions  -- I wanted to make poems or stories that somehow
reached the same part of my ear and brain. It wasn't until I got to State
in 1982 that I was exposed to works that did just that.  Doors flew open:
Stein; the NY School; various local writers -- especially Carla Harryman.

Didn't you give a talk in Kathleen Fraser's Writers on Writing class (I
guess I was at State just a little while after you were) at around that
time?  I have some memory of it, but distant... anyway I also took
Kathleen's women's writing workshop; it was one of the workshops I was
thinking about when I wrote my post.  Jessica Grim was in that workshop
(although she had not taken the turn into language writing yet) and so was
Colette Lafia -- both, along with Lori Lubeski, later became my writing
comrades.  I remember bringing in about four pages of writing that was a
rush of language -- prose (maybe the combined influences of Silliman,
Hejinian & Rodefer), and after I read it, that puzzled silence.  Kathleen
said something about how more and  more of her students were writing "like
this."  I felt characterized but not attended to, as if she was not looking
at the writing I had done but was instead categorizing it. It seemed a
politicized categorization, like there was some kind of polemic lurking
under her words.  I don't remember the reactions of the other participants
but I remember feeling unsatisfied.  Maybe they didn't have techniques for
responding to writing "like that" -- writing like wind, writing from the
ear, not trying to make anything whole or tell a story or make a point.

The other women's workshop I was thinking of was one I started here in an
attempt to forge some community.  The thing about being an expat is that
you can't be too picky about who you let in; the potential participants are
limited.  Almost none of the women identified themselves as writers,
although they wrote a little or wanted to write.  Our sessions were most
interesting when we actually spent some time writing together (but not
collaboratively) in them.  Otherwise, mostly "dopey" responses.  As you
wrote, though,

>>As far as women's workshops go, I don't see why there couldn't be a good
>>one if you had women coming from the same place

It's just that, in Tokyo, people writing in English never come from the
same place, geographically or otherwise.  It's a great place for hot tubs
though -- almost as good as Marin.

Was it?  In your crowd there were people doing such amazing things -- Bruce
Boone, Bob Gluck, Michael Amnasan.  You all seemed pretty cool to me.

That's too bad about the bossy wanna-be-langpos.  I don't deny that part of
the real langpos' attractiveness as a group was their power -- I've said so
before on this list.  I always wanted to be powerful (in my childhood I
fantasized about being a rock star -- I really wanted to *be* --not
*marry*-- John Lennon & Roger Daltrey -- does this make me male-identified?
I never dreamed about being, say, Carole King) and still have to work hard
to control my arrogance -- or I use it in my writing (i.e. my old booklet,
Rodomontade, which means "boastful, bragging speech").  I think it's the
flip side of the chutzpah a writer or a teacher or a performer needs to
assume (even if it's an act) in order to do her work -- I would guess that
you understand that. Living in Japan for a decade *has* made me see the
virtue of having a little bit of humility -- I guess now I'd like to be a
kind of combination of Maria Callas and Lao Tsu.

I'm pretty sure Kathleen picked up on my arrogance -- Lori, Jessica,
Colette & I took an independent study course with her -- it was great --
she'd read aloud sections of The Tale of Genji or Remembrance of Things
Past and we'd write as she read -- but I'm sure I was snotty sometimes and
remember hearing that she'd mentioned to someone that as a group we were
"difficult."  At that time, I would have considered that a compliment --
remember I came to writing fresh out of punk rock.

Yes, me too.  I never send work out partly for this reason, and I don't
write nearly enough.  One thing that annoys me about my writing is its
obsession with gender in its content.  Why should that annoy me?  Noting
this obsession, I called a manuscript "A Gender" (think of a midwestern
farmer saying agenda) and then later changed it to "Foriegnn Bodie", which
still seems annoyingly topical.

Really?  Like what?  I don't remember that being the case -- and now I'm
too far away to know about it.

 I think some of the people who are railing about
>inequalities with men should think about being nicer to the women they
>know.  And this isn't aimed at you, Gordon, I have no idea how you are to

It depends on the women, I guess.  I only know a couple women writers here,
and they have poetics very different from mine. Remember I only see the USA
women writers I know *at most* once a year.  And I LOVE them:  Andrea
Hollowell (who was here with me for two years), Lori Lubeski, Pat Reed, Lee
Ann Brown, Julie Reagan, Norma Cole, Carla Harryman ... all brilliant and
inspiring.

OK, cherry blossoms calling again.  I have only a few days left in my
spring vacation before I start teaching and I no longer have time to write
long posts like this.

as far as poetry being on the shelves of bookstores, this largely depends
on the education of the book buyer. When i was managing the hardcover
department of a large bookstore in boston, the publishers reps would come
in and show me the new jackets of books about to be published, often they'd
skip right over the new poetry releases thinking they were published solely
for libraries, one time I'm staring at the jacket of Pablo Neruda's latest
and the guy turns the page saying: that's poetry i won't waste your time.
Of course i said: back up that guy's going to win the nobel prize. So it's
a struggle even to get the giants on the shelf. one thing poets and readers
might do is conscientiously request their libraries order every book
they're interested in reading whether they've already bought it or not, it
only takes a few minutes and they won't order every one you ask for but if
you don't request you'll never get and if they only order ten percent
that's five or ten books that wouldn't have been there and are now
available to thousands of readers, sometimes it helps to lie, tell them in
Minneapolis and Alberquerque both that Alice Notely is a local writer, that
Katy Lederer, the editor of this dynamite mag, Explosive, just moved down
the street from the library in Dubuque. You're poets, you've got
imaginations, get out there and fabricate, it's your future you're
creating.


Epiphany (for Matthew Ezra)

One of the reasons i still have the affections
of my handsome and intelligent child
now twenty seven years old
is that i stopped smoking
27 years and 8 mos ago enabling him
to be 100% cuter and 3 times as smart
as his IMProv/Ident dad
enabling his dad to
have the stamina
to sing to the squalling babe
3 am rock him in my arms
my voice enCHANTing him
soothing him lulling him
sweetening his dreams
irritating his mother no end
she needed her sleep
she went to work in the morning
working at home--parenting and writing
cooking, cleaning, shopping,
many mornings i'd push him
in his stroller to the county art museum
to the farmers market
along The Walk of The Stars past Gruman's Chinese
to the newstand at Hollywood and Vine
Sunset Boulevard, LaBrea Tar Pits,
the Miracle Mile and i love him
and never miss a chance to tell him so
and his children are cuter and smarter
than both of us

Which is complicated all the more by the "fact" that besides those who have
achieved life after death or (the) God(s)ess(es) <grin> there is no true
outsider position.  Particularly in the U.S., where the 'culture', at least
the mass marketed one(s), saturate the geography of our lives, there is no
way to be completely apart from the world.  There is a certain blindness
one develops to things and a certain apriorizing (pardon the word creation)
that occurs in the process of negotiating the days.

Don,  thanks for the warning.  Personally, I'm more worried about tsunamis and
all the nuclear weapons stockpiled here on oahu.

But one of your old students dug rothschild is
spreading the notion that allegorical subtext of the movie
titanic, ie. a supposedly unsinkable ship that sinks, is about the "immanent"
crash of the stock market.  I'm not sure if he made up
the allegory or he got it from you or you planted that kind

Joe Amato, you being a student of Don's, don't have this titanic vision do
you?

in the hardscrabble of the corncow frontier, the cherry trees of
dreamtime are just budding, even too early for this asyntactic quick
spring--growing sand cherries & nanking cherries & korean cherries & pie
cherries & black cherries & chokecherries & bird cherries.

a long way from the cameras & tourists & the money that makes them smell
so good...and the damned cherry gets planted more every year...

From The New York Times, March 27

Hilda Morley, 81; Wrote Poetry Shaped by Abstract Expressionism

      By WOLFGANG SAXON

     Hilda Morley, an American poet who gained wide recognition late
     in life, decades after she first published her imagist free verse,
     died on Monday at Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London. A
     former resident of Sag Harbor, N.Y., she was 81 and had moved to
     London last year to continue work on a biography of her late
     husband, the avant-garde composer Stefan Wolpe.

     The cause was liver failure after a fall at home, said a
     spokeswoman for her publisher, Moyer Bell.

     Ms. Morley published five books of poetry in which she articulated
     emotions and feelings in free verse, but a type of verse as
     measured as dance or music. She was a "master of that ability,"
     Robert Creeley, a fellow poet, said.

     She wrote that her poetry was shaped by the visions of Abstract
     Expressionism, which can create metamorphoses. Artists like Klee
     and Picasso, she said, gave her the means to create word canvases
     depicting the world around her.

     Born Hilda Auerbach in Manhattan, Ms. Morley considered herself an
     inhabitant of the world. She was educated in New York, Haifa (in
     what was then known as Palestine), London and at Wellesley College,
     Ohio State University and New York University.

     Along the way she taught English at a private school in England and
     at Walden School in New York, where she also worked as a researcher
     for the Zionist Youth Commission and as a Hebrew translator for the
     Office of War Information.

     Starting in the 1940's, she intermittently lectured at Rutgers
     University. After her marriage in 1952, she taught English
     literature at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. Once
     recognized as a poet, she took academic assignments, lecturing,
     leading poetry workshops and judging poetry. She was a resident
     poet at Northeast Missouri University in 1992.

     Ms. Morley is survived by a stepdaughter, Katherina Wolpe of
     London.

     The first collection of her previously published poetry was _A
     Blessing Outside Us_ (1976). It was followed by three others that
     remain in print: _What Are Winds & What Are Waters_ (1993),
     _To Hold in My Hand: Selected Poems, 1955-83_ (1984) and
     _Cloudless at First_ (1988).

     Her final collection was _The Turning_, which has just been
     published. It includes "Fiesta, Ibiza," her evocation of a place
     she savored:

     Warm crystal
     of my little
     city;
     the fishes
     swim over the bay,
     rooftops swooping
     with light,
     the wreaths & garlands
     bursting gently
     in night's element,
     the sunlit branches
     exploding
     softly,
     the sea baring
     its lights burning
     the unshadowed joys

Jeff your response to Alice Notley's essay reminds me of a line from
Notley's book _How Spring Comes_. She says that one is never a latent
anything because one is always living and experiencing. Maybe someone with
the book can correct that?

Anyway in re conformity take away the smog from the word and you have the
problem. Speaking to someone in a recognizable way is conforming, no? not
speaking just drives people mad with wanting to know what you're thinking,
and speaking unrecognizably, well it's ok for art in bursts.

This time it's different, right?

Just want to say, as someone who got a little behind reading my digests,
that all the new names talking like mad here are great to have present &
accounted for. That many are women not heard here that often is also
terrific. But it's just that there have been a number of interesting &
provocative threads recently, & that's a good thing.

But, however erratic the approaches, surely everything we say is personal
in some way? Even as it might also register resistance to 'just being
personal, eh?' It's the ways in which such a contra/diction plays itself
out, like maybe in Nada's neat penis poem, or the various posts about
writing & being, that hold our (or my) attention.

Marcella,

I feel very much the same way.  It's an indication of the fact that even
among people with much else in common, feminist politics is still
contested ground.  But what you say above is certainly true, and in this
context anodyne.

For instance, one post that disturbed me:

I think Standard is one of the really exciting and important young poets
and editors on the scene.  But I found his recent post terribly worrisome.
He seemed to imply that he saw no way for men to fit into an anti-sexist
stand; something to the effect of, how can *a man* speak against sexism?
He seemed to be assuming that the concerns about gender
disbalance various people had stated were rooted in people's essences;
whereas I assume them to be social constructs that can be critiqued and
worked against and understood.  I thought "we" (as a society) had at least
established that as one major political/analytic position.  But the word
hasn't reached everywhere I guess.

In addition to your suggestions, there is the very broad topic of
non-mainstream poets whose work engages gender politics on various levels,
even though those poets have not *extensively* theorized the feminist
underpinnings (if that's what they are) of what they are doing.  The two
who came immediately to my mind were Susan Howe and Rosmarie Waldrop.  Not
having a direct-address componant to one's poetics (where say, Adrienne
Rich drops into a somber soliloquy on the violence facing women in
american cities) presents the question of just how political stresses are
woven into a body of poetry. A political poetry can take up and amplify
processes of violence and inward abrasion, forcing them to a kind of
ultimate verbal breaking-point (Andrews in "I Don't Have any Paper," for
instance). This seems a very abrupt (not to say masculine) approach and
its relationship to a feminist politics is a very tangled question.
Gender encodings and nodes of pressure exist in S. Howe's work through
confrontation with (and I think that's a good word for how she does it)
historical material that is felt as palpably present in the lived matrix
of the poet and her audience.  Even when on a literal documentary level
this "history"  "took place" in 1645 or 1820.....

I actually think that many (mostly women) poets appearing today in the
mags, are approaching these tensions with similar creativity.  (A very
large proportion of 'em being poets who participate on this list)  I wish
I had seen more of their work, in larger chunks, so I could comment on it
intelligently.

Anyway, Marcella, compliments on a valuable post.

No, at that point, I don't think anybody would have even considered
inviting me to that class.  Michael Amnasan, however, did speak and that's
how he and Jessica met--at least that's the way my memory goes.  [Editorial
comment:  Michael and Jessica were "together" for several years.]  And yes
you must have been at State just a little after me because I knew Jessica
then, Lori a bit later.

This is odd, considering it was in her classes I first read Lyn and Carla,
many of the female Lang-Pos.  And I remember "experimental" works turned in
by students to be praised.  Your bringing up categorizing is interesting
because the whole How(ever) project was about bringing "female"
experience/perspective into experimental forms.  The poetic avant-garde, it
was perceived, was ruled by men, and Kathleen's project was to create a
sort of antidote to that.  But, I always thought there was a (mostly
unspoken) privileging of what was acceptable femaleness.  A certain
lady-likness.  Thank god Kathy Acker was around at the same time.  As I
remember you from those days, Nada, you were rather punked out with a lot
of attitude (your arrogance as you put it).  I wonder how that impacted
your perceived relationship to jouissance?

I had the dreadful combination of arrogance and absolutely no
self-confidence.  I needed constant approval from others to really get me
started in writing.  I think I still use Kevin for that more than I should.

>Was it?  In your crowd there were people doing such amazing things -- Bruce
>Boone, Bob Gluck, Michael Amnasan.  You all seemed pretty cool to me.

That scene, the failed attempt to forge a New Narrative movement was much a
reaction to the then disrespect of narrative, an attempt to reinvent
narrative so that it could be as arty as lang-po--that's what I'd say on a
bad day.  On a good day, I'd say it was about admitting the falsity of the
conventional absent author, bringing the act of writing into the piece,
experimenting with different subjectivities, stuff about community in its
early idealistic days, etc.  Studying (that's the wrong word, hanging out
endlessly is more accurate) with Bruce, it was a lot about seduction, he
was heavy into Bataille then--he was always talking to me about the
relationship between the writer and the audience, would compare it to an SM
relationship, the author being the top, the reader being the bottom.  A far
cry from How(ever).  I was heavy into being corrupted by these sicko
perverts.  We'd lie on his bed and he'd read me Baudelaire.  It was
thrilling.

I don't know, I don't have problems with this.  I'm in a female
body/consciousness in a fucked up world--and that's what I write about, I
can't imagine wanting to write about anything else--unless I was getting
paid.

The sad thing is that something so one-dimensional would --if you p.c.'d
the title-- would make huge amounts of money.

Iceberg Lettuce for the Soul: Light anecdotes for a thinful Age,
Iceberg Lettuce for the Soul: Jack Handy's thoughts for a post-big hair
world.
Iceberg Lettuce on Soul (Food): a cookbook for the deep(ness) challenged

You could almost publish a whole book of just the titles.  At least turn it
into a perverse Exquisite Corpse.  One of our cat either hates the idea or
loves it.  She just jumped up here and started batting at the keys...

Here it is at last--Mary Margaret Sloan's ambitious, groundbreaking
anthology of formal innovation by US and Canadian women over the past
thirty years, and tonight, like Salome, it's unveiled, with brief readings
from its Bay Area contributors (and editor Sloan herself).  They're all
here, front and center, a dazzling chorus line of fragmentation and
history.  "It is the specificity of each author's art that is most
rewarding here: the exhilarating originality of each poetic project and the
deep reflection with which these poets explore not just poetry but the
possibilities of meaning through language." (Charles Bernstein).

        Thanks for posting Emily's work to the list, Katy.  I'd just like
to add that Emily will have two poems in the second (summer) issue of
Kenning.  And no, she doesn't send out.  It takes some sleuthing
sometimes.

Mark:

Hate to think of myself as an essentialist, but am not sure what I did to
convey this.  I do, however, think that people are afraid of the personal and
tend to over-intellectualize in response instead of just take care not to
exploit it.  (Judith Butler makes excellent points about this, better than I
can.)  I always thought that the point of the critique of the subject was to
reveal the social within the personal, but the personal doesn't go away, does
it?  We have the perception, however distorted, of a self.

I think all I was trying to say is that I'm always a little nervous around the
ways in which a group I belong to are unable to reflect on what they are
doing, what effect it is having.  I consider myself anti-sexist, but I don't
always agree with everybody on my side of the issue.  Sometimes they get
suspicious if you disagree with some tiny point.  Does this make me an
essentialist?

Mark, please straighten me out as I have appreciated many of your comments to
the list and feel you're a solid voice for these kinds of issues.  If you or
anyone can straighten me out about what was "worrisome" in those posts, would
like to be enlightened.

                                New obstacles for exchange arise

                                Or unfold, O ye postmasters!



1. About the Poetics List


The Poetics List was founded in late 1993 with the epigraph above.


There are presently over 600 subscribers.


Please note that this is a private list and information about the list
should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is
to keep the list to those with specific rather than general interests,
and also to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume
manageable.


The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While
individual posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we
continue to work to promote the editorial function of this project. The
definition of that project, while provisional, and while open to
continual redefinition by list participants, is nonetheless aversive to a
generalized discussion of poetry. Rather, our aim is  to support, inform,
and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
**<color><param>ffff,0000,0000</param>We also encourage subscribers to
post information on publications and reading series that they have
coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear (see section 9
below).** (THIS MEANS *YOU*).

</color>

Please keep in mind that all posts go out immediately to all subscribers,
and become part of an on-line archive. *<italic>Posting to Poetics is a
form of publication, not personal communication</italic>.* Participants
are asked to exercise caution before posting messages! While spontaneity
of response may seem the very heart of the list at its best, it also has
the darker side of circulating ideas that have not been well considered
(or considered by another reader -- editor or friend). Given the nature
of the medium, subscribers do well to maintain some skepticism when
reading the list and, where possible, to try to avoid taking what may be
something close to a spontaneous comment made in the heat of exchange as
if it were a revised or edited essay ("Let the Reader Beware!").=20


The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein. Joel Kuszai is list
manager.  For subscription information contact us at
POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu.

2. Subscriptions


Subscriptions to Poetics are free of charge. But we ask that you
subscribe with your real name and we reserve the right to request
additional information, including address and phone number. All
subscription information you supply will remain confidential.


You can subscribe (sub) or unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line
message, with no subject line, to:


listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu


the one-line message should say:


unsub poetics


{or}


sub poetics Jill Jillway


(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your

name to unsub)


We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity. Please allow
several days for your new or re-subscription to take effect.=20


*


If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:


Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use
Eudora (an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites):
from the Tools menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending
Mail": you may be able to substitute your old address here and send the
unsub message.


The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages
may get bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned
to us. If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an
increase from your system administrator. (You may wish to argue that this
subscription is part of your scholarly communication!) You may also wish
to consider obtaining a commercial account.


In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your account, your
subscription to Poetics will be temporarily suspended. If this happens,
simply resubscribe to the list in the normal manner, once your account
problem has been resolved.


All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to the list's
administrative address: poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu. Please note that it may
take up to ten days, or more, for us to reply to messages.=20

____________________________________________________________________


3.  Cautions


Please do not post to the list personal or backchannel correspondence, or
other unpublished material, without the express permission of the author.
Copyright for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author;
material from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".


The Poetics List has a 50 message daily limit. If more than 50 messages
are received, the listserver will automatically hold those additional
messages until the list is manually unlocked, usually the following day.
While it is difficult to prescribe a set limit on the number of daily,
weekly, or monthly posts for any  subscriber, please keep this limit in
mind. If you plan to respond to multiple threads, it is generally
preferable to consolidate your reply into one message. While relevant
excerpts from a post to which you are responding may usefully be appended
to your reply, please do not include in your new post the whole text of a
long previously posted message.


Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a
post, since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via
"digest" or who cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.=20


In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also
become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry events
and publications are always welcome. (See section 7.)


Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.


If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or
supply information missing from an post, or thank someone for posting
something you requested, please send the request or comment to the
individual backchannel, not to the whole list.=20


____________________________________________________________________


4. Digest Option


The Listserve program gives you he option to receive all the posted
Poetics message each day as a single message. If you would prefer to
receive ONE message each day, which would include all messages posted to
the list for that day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line
message (no subject line) to


                                listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu


set poetics digest


NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply

to this message!!


You can switch back to individual messages by sending this message:


set poetics mail

____________________________________________________________________


5. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail


Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be
away for any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and
you may lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can
temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by sending a message to
"listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu"


set poetics nomail


& turn it on again with: set poetics mail


When you return you can check or download missed postings from the
Poetics

archive. (See 8 below.)


____________________________________________________________________


6. Who's Subscribed


To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the
e-mail message blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:


  review poetics


You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail) a
rather long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics
subscribers.  This list is alphabetized by server not name.


 or try:


 review POETICS by name

 review POETICS by country


which will give you the list alphabetically by name or a flawed list by
country (since all ".com" and ".net"s are counted as US)


*Please do not send a message to the list asking for the address of a
specific subscriber.*

____________________________________________________________________


7. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?


our URL is


http://writing.upenn.edu/epc


The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to
serve as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity in
formally innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The
Center provides access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources
in the new poetries including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals,
the POETICS List archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts,
and direct connections to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The
Center also provides information about contemporary print little
magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics. And we have an
extensive collection of soundfiles of poets' reading their work, as well
as the archive of LINEbreak, the radio interview series.


The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

____________________________________________________________________


8. Poetics Archives via EPC

Nada--I really appreciate this post.  I can't seem to catch up on the
list and I keep having more I want to respond to but reading takes all
the time and no time for considered response.  I was particularly
relating to the part about men's response to your poems.  (Morpheal
generally seems way out there and not at all in the discourse that I for
one am having)  I write a lot of raunchy poems.  I don't consider them
particularly autobiographical though of course life is a source of
information.  Men are always coming up to me after reading such poems.
"I never thought that way about lesbians before" i.e. sexualized.  I
think often they want me to do to them physically what the poems do
linguistically.  Really they are so obvious.  Admittedly, part of me
enjoys this play.  Their effort to define 'lesbian' and my slipping
through the cracks.  Someone, perhaps Katy wrote about becoming
feminized in the west.  I think that's happened to me too, west + age
and choosing battles carefully.  I recalled to a friend that from when I
was a little girl I understood that I was the sort of girl the boys, and
later, the men, would hit, because I always managed to piss them off so.
I think its about defining the rules of the dialogue.  If we break the
rules by adding the complexity of our experience, i.e. we want to get
fucked by something muscular and powerful without giving up power, there
is a gap which calls for an inventive response.  And I have still to see
the demand for inventive/imaginative permutations of gender enter into
the mainstream.  Its one of the reasons I love my queer
community--despite all the problems of being a pre-defined other.

more to say but later, no?

Mark (sorry, but I feel I must go on):

Still thinking re: essentialism

I think it should be a commonplace by now that one does not use collective
nouns without suspicion, anxiety, etc.  The performative aspects of gender
seem to me to be quite clear on this list.  I think I’m getting in trouble for
not knowing exactly how to play my part.  What is my motivation?  Perhaps, I
should try to be clearer, however, I don’t think quoting a passage from Lacan
will help in this regard.  (May help in other regards, for other things, no
offense to Katy.)

One thing I’m noticing is that exactly what I feared would happen, is
happening.  I’m ‘worrying’ people simply by trying to get "women" to tell me
exactly what the relevance of a gender conversation is to the act of writing
poetry.  Dodie implies, I think, that as to the degree that she is a "woman,"
it effect the content of her writing.  Have not heard anyone address the form
or technique issue.  Here, I am reminded of John Shoptaw’s interesting book on
Ashbery wherein he outlines how Ashbery’s "homosexuality" effected the way he
wrote.  Does not in any way imply that all homosexuals are "homotextual"
writers, etc.

I am trying to find out if people still feel that poetry can be seen as "a
haven" of sorts where various languages, techniques, forms can be explored,
deployed in a way that is relatively ideologically less policed than say
fashion or mainstream fiction.  (Vaguely recall Bernstein making a point in
Diacritics, I think, about this space I am trying to describe.) h

I can easily accept that poetry is necessarily theoretical, but I am wondering
if Katy and others are attempting to make active methodological interventions
into critical/philosophical discourse.  I would ask them if they think their
"poetry" is some how formally enhancing/progressing their thoughts on gender.

Does anyone have thoughts about this?

The reason I am asking is that when I see a title like "Artificial Memory #1"
which is from Norma Cole (just happens to be on my mind), I tend to think
first about "artificial memories,"  memory, construction, artifice,
whathaveyou.  I do not tend to focus entirely on "the gap" where I might
discover only that her poem has some trace or residue that is the result of
her gender construction which I already suspect since I have participated in
the pedagogy that is fascinated with what is "not on the page" sometimes to
the exclusion of what is "on the page."  For this reason, I have to ask
questions.

Or else I have to I leave that entire conversation to the "writers of
dissertations" as Pound called them.

Standard,

In response to what's quoted below....

I read your first substantial post (I think it was the first) in response
to Katy, as questioning whether a man could genuinely critique sexism.
This is where the lack of special other clues, tone of voice etc.  gets us
into all kindsa trouble on the Net.  Entirely my fault and I apologize.
It seemed in context that the sentences I'm thinking of meant, "Men by
their nature probably can't rebel/work against sexism," rather than what
you meant, which is apparently, "This is a very problematic, unresolved
issue: how *do* men work effectively against sexism anyway?" or something
like that....

Anyhow, glad for your comments; as quite a number of folks on the List
(unless I'm misreading them too!!) question the importance of these issues
altogether!

Standard....In response to your *second* post (we seem to be
criss-crossing each other in real time here, an odd experience..)

I think you raise very important points.  I don't always follow your exact
arguments; but these are very important issues.  Part of what I believe
you are questioning, is whether political weight should be allowed to
squash the areas of free-play and kindling-flash out of contemporary
poetry.

I don't feel that that is a danger, but this may just be my temperment.  I
don't feel that a poet such as Fanny Howe (see: Introduction to the World)
or Susan Howe, or Bernstein or Silliman, or Spahr in Response, or Mark
Wallace, have allowed political concerns, often with gender dimensions,
sometimes not, to flatten the space for free play inherent in the act of
poetry.

But then they all *feel* the exigencies of political twist and strain, as
a part of their consciousness and concrete lives.  When that is the case
neither poetry nor poetics are narrowed by including a political dimension
(--the only narrowing would take place, if they *excluded* it).

Thus, in my own work as poet and editor, and in the way I see most poetry
I encounter today, there is a strong political component.  And if there
weren't (given who I am) my work and consciousness would be "ideologically
policed."  But this shouldn't (can't, actually) be imposed from without.
If you don't feel certain political issues (including gender ones) as at
the flash-point of what you're doing at a given moment, then you shouldn't
include those issues in your work.  I might argue with someone that, as a
person, they need to give more thought/involvement to one political issue
or another....But until they had begun to feel it as lived turmoil, it
would have no place in their poetry. And twenty years on the left will
convince you that you don't get people feeling stuff in a lived way, by
bullying, only by arguments and respect.

The equation is: the person, enmeshed in the grinding societal matrix,
generates concerns, politics, values, commitments; that helps shape who
the person is; and that person is the poet...only what that person feels
is important, can inform the poetry.  It can't be imposed from the
outside.  You should indeed resist "ideological policing" if you feel it
is being imposed on your or anyone's poetry....But people who are deeply
involved with the political edge of things, are not necessarily
ideologically policing you.  I never looked good in a uniform, myself.

“haut et bas”
This work for Xerolage must be called “high” and “low”; “up” and
“down”......It’s about the possibility for these images to be read in
any direction.  About the life to be read like that; between
autobiography & history, between roots & exile, fight & slavery.  So I
mixed my family old pictures & historic events (especially about eastern
& communist history), signs & words in all languages concerned by the
images: french, russian, breton, spanish, german.....So you need a
dictionary to appreciate all the images’ meanings.  It’s up to you to
link all these meanings together; to connect signs, words, & images; to
give them back a signification; your signification.

Excuse the length of this posting but the world needs to know about this
bookstore.  Below is an article/interview about Woodland Pattern Book
Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin that was just published in "The Review of
Contemporary Fiction" (spring 1998).  In all my journeys, no bookstore
(with an emphasis on poetry) has even come close to the quality of this
place. Others on this list may be able to vouch for this, and if you are
in the area it is definitely worth a visit (or by phone: (414) 263-5001).

The Bookstore in America: Woodland Pattern

The previous article in this series focused on Borders Books and Music as
one possibility of what the bookstore and bookselling might be in the
future, and what forebodes for the future and avail ability of books in
the United States. Following that article with one devoted to Woodland
Pattern Book Center in Milwaukee might seem a ridiculous second step, but
Woodland Pattern is a very interesting alternative to, not only a chain
bookstore, but conventional independent stores.
My first experience with Woodland Pattern must have been just about the
time that it opened in 1979, now almost twenty years ago. It had been
recommended to me by the poet-novelist Paul Metcalf, who had either given
a reading there or was about to give a reading. Located in a neighborhood
of Milwaukee rather than in prime retail space in the downtown, and rather
inconspicuously settled in the middle of a block that does not, I believe,
have any other retail space, it's rather easy to drive by the store a few
times without noticing it, something I usually manage to do.
My first visit to Woodland Pattern meant that I had to drive from Chicago
to Milwaukee, approximately 90 miles, or 180 round-trip, solely for the
purpose of going to what Metcalf had promised me was a very good store.
What I found was a store that had an incredible selection of literary
magazines that could not be found in Chicago (and also had several back
issues of these magazines, which perhaps spoke to the popularity of the
magazines but also to the proprietors' commitment to keeping things
available), and the best selection of poetry (perhaps this should be
"poetry," because it was an in-depth selection of what one of the
proprietors most liked-the Black Mountain poets, the New York School, San
Francisco poets, the Objectivists; noticeably absent were the poets who
were receiving the big awards and those most often published by Knopf,
Norton, and Farrar, Straus). There were also tapes of writers reading, a
criticism section, a rather unconventional children's section; at least,
this is all that I remember. I spent several hours there, and began what
became a once or twice a year trip there, and one that cost me (aside from
travel expenses) far more than I could afford. And several of those trips
over the years were also related to or planned around attending one of the
readings that were held (and still are) in a special room attached to the
store, which is also used for art exhibits (that is, there are no books in
the room).

As the interview that follows makes clear, Woodland Pattern was begun as
an alternative store, not a marketing endeavor to counter competitors,
which at that time would have been Webster's (now defunct) and Schwartz's;
the chains, at least as we know them now, did not exist. Woodland Pattern
began as a conception of its founders, one of whom was obsessed with
poetry, the other with ... a variety of things. They saw their role as
serving a community. Because of their interests, they thought that poetry
should be the primary focus of the store and that it should be well
stocked and kept there, regardless of sales; and there should be this
public reading space that would feature the writers they liked and would
become a very interesting space for exhibits of various kinds; if the
store failed financially, then at least the failure would be on their
terms. And they began as a nonprofit endeavor, not just (I assume) because
there in fact was no profit to be made, but because such a status made
them eligible for the little amount of grant money available to things
bookish.

Woodland Pattern has now survived almost twenty years, despite being so
noncommercial. And it has survived long enough to see itself modeled in
other forms of retail-the "boutique." So, twenty years ago, the only kind
of "coffee shop" was the greasy spoon on the corner, and no one could have
foreseen such a thing as Starbucks, never mind the several non-chain
specialty coffee- houses that exist even in the smallest of American
towns. Woodland Pattern is, aside from some of the other products it
sells, a specialty store that emphasizes what everyone knows cannot
support a bookstore-poetry. And yet, because of this specialization and
because of other strategic thinking on the part of its founders, the store
goes on, and on. Despite what the founders fear would be the effect of a
superstore moving in nearby, Woodland Pattern Book Center is, I think, an
example of the kind of store that a chain could not compete with, nor
would want to compete with. Woodland Pattern is doing something
essentially different from traditional retail bookselling, and stays
carefully within the niche it has created for itself.

In terms of the future of bookstores in America, one question is whether a
Woodland Pattern-type store can be duplicated elsewhere by people who
could learn from its experience, or whether this is a store/center that is
unique and completely dependent upon its founders. So, for instance, could
Chicago sustain such an operation, in effect becoming the place for
poetry, the place for poets to read, and then the place for whatever other
interests the founders have? And if this is possible for poetry, isn't it
also possible for literary translation? perhaps even literary fiction?
experimental writing? In other words, if the chains have become the
all-purpose and widely stocked bookstores, is there room now for highly
specialized stores that can do things that are beyond what the chains are
doing? Of course, all of the above represent rather small markets, and
therefore perhaps all must of necessity be nonprofits. If Woodland Pattern
could be duplicated, we then have another model-other than that presented
by the chains-for what the future of bookselling in America might be.

INTERVIEW WITH WOODLAND PATTERN OWNERS, KARL GARTUNG AND ANNE KINGSBURY

RCF: Let's start at the beginning. How did the idea for Woodland Pattern
come about?
Karl Gartung: Well, there was a bookstore called Boox, Incorporated that
was started by Karl Young and Tom Montag when they were running Margins
magazine and Tom had a little distribution deal he was running on the side
out of Margins-that was about the time that Leonard Randolph was at the
National Endowment and they decided to set up a distribution project.
Since Margins was pretty well regarded, they were invited to submit a
grant. So they submitted a grant for both distribution projects at Boox,
Incorporated. It was not nonprofit at that point, so they had to route all
the money through the state arts board. It was a piddling grant, $5,000 or
something like that. One of the things they were supposed to do was to
hire someone to watch the store and they hired me. They had a little
gallery hooked to it. It was in the "lobby" of a theater called Theater X
here in downtown Milwaukee.
RCF: When did Boox, Incorporated open?
KG: That was opened in 1973-74. When I arrived, it was altogether
voluntary. Publishers sent in their books and it turned out to be a
donation; they never got paid for them because there was no money. The
grant gave Boox, Incorporated money for salary and they had money to buy
some books. When they interviewed me, I was complaining that the only
person I was really interested in at the time, which shows my limitations
I suppose, was William Carlos Williams. I had been looking around for all
this poetry and all I could find were poets like Richard Wilbur and Robert
Lowell and all the confessional poets and the Beats and so on and so
forth. The Beats were interesting but not very sustaining as far as I was
concerned. Now that judgment on them is just a judgment on me, but what I
was really looking for were the Objectivists and the Black Mountain poets
but I didn't know they existed, let alone where they were.
RCF: When does this hook up with something called Woodland Pattern?
KG: Well, I worked in this store and here were all these books. Charles
Olson and the Objectivists were on the shelves already. So I was home at
that point. I had always been involved with theater and Anne was a visual
artist and here we were in the lobby of this theater and it had a little
gallery and it had a bookstore. But we outgrew the situation of sharing
the building with the theater. It got to be cumbersome and we wanted to
invite people into town to do readings and we couldn't guarantee that we
would have a room for them to read in. We started looking around to move.
At that point we also decided that we didn't want to be running all the
money through the arts board. We also decided we'd change our name. We
found it in Paul Metcalf's book Apalache. That's where "Woodland Pattern"
came from: ". . . south of Lake Superior, a culture center: the Woodland
Pattern, with pottery but without agriculture, imported without loss from
Lake Baikal, Siberia . . ." We found this little building that we could
afford; Anne was losing her job with the university, so we had some of her
retirement money and she was willing. We bought the building and moved
Woodland Pattern up there. By that time we had gone from one hundred
titles to about five thousand titles.
Anne Kingsbury: We decided we wanted to buy a building because we wanted
to keep the rent stable. We were looking with some other groups and they
found a building before we did and they didn't have room for us. They
fixed it up beautifully, but they had only a year lease. At the end of the
year they couldn't afford the rent of the building they had improved so
much. We decided that we weren't going to do that.
KG: We had another opportunity: there was a high school that was closing
and they offered us room. I thought to myself that this is still a
teaching facility and some parent is going to come through here and see
William Burroughs or John Giorno or our exhibits. So the first time that
would happen we thought we wouldn't have a place anyway.
RCF: In what year did the current location open?
AK: We stepped into the building to start tearing down walls on December
26th, 1979. We opened to the public about six to eight weeks later with
one room. That included changing the building and getting that one room
ready, which is currently the middle room. And people went through what
looked like a dingy, warehouse type thing to get to it. The second room we
opened up was the gallery. Our first program was an independent filmmaker
from Chicago.
KG: We had a whole series of independent films. That became our
performance series at the time. There were several local filmmakers who
were involved, and some Chicago filmmakers came up. Then came independent
music and then the poetry program and fiction readings. And then we had
the gallery shows and we quickly started the mural project on the
building.
RCF: When Woodland Pattern was started, was it nonprofit?
KG: Yes. We knew that if we wanted to be a bookseller and make a profit,
we wouldn't be able to sell new literature.
AK: There are a lot of really good bookstores in Milwaukee. There are some
good independent bookstores and I know that some of the chains are better
than others. But to carry the back issues of  the Review of Contemporary
Fiction, for instance, and to give it shelf space and to carry some of our
chapbooks and to keep the prices consistent, well, you're not going to
make the money per square foot on these books if you want to hang onto
them and not turn them over after a certain amount of time. You need a
subsidy or independent wealth.
In 1982, we had a book conference, a small press book fair. We got Ted
Wilentz to come in as a keynote speaker. He used to run the 8th Street
Bookshop in New York and he was also a consultant around the world. We
held the event at the university. I took him over to Woodland Pattern. I
knew about his background as a bookseller and consultant and I worried
that when he walked in he would say, "You better get some romance and
mysteries and Westerns in here." And when he walked in he looked around
and he said, " You need to be subsidized. You need to keep going but it
won't be possible in a commercial situation. But it's important that you
keep going so you're going to need to get other kinds of help." It was a
reinforcement for us. When you're getting started, you're not quite sure
if everything will work out.
KG: At that time, if you walked into any commercial bookstore in the
country they would always have a poetry section of twenty-five titles and
they were always the same ones. To have a bookstore where people would
walk into the store, and even if they were literate they wouldn't
recognize ninety-nine percent of the titles, well, to think you could make
that self-supporting is ludicrous.
RCF: What kind of support was available at the time?
AK: We received funding from the National Endowment for the Arts from the
time we were incorporated until they reconfigured last year and eliminated
the literature program. Last year was the first year we did not receive
NEA funding. I applied under one of their categories and we didn't make
it. But before that, we had received money every year. So you never could
take it for granted, but there was always that. The state has an arts
council and we would get a little funding there. It's a source that has
been consistent. The city has program money and the county has
organizational operations support money But everything is diminishing,
partially because of the National Endowment cutbacks. The state receives
money from the NEA, and when those funds dry up or are reconfigured, then
they eliminate the kinds of funds that we can apply for. So where we used
to be eligible to receive money in three categories, now we are eligible
only for one. And the city is the same way; we used to receive money in
two categories, now we can apply only for one. Thank goodness they're
still going, hut there is less to apply for.
RCF: How do you compensate for this?
AK: Well, we've been lucky. I have this pouch that I'm making with a quote
from Emily Dickinson. The quote says, "Luck is not chance, it's toil.
Fortune's expensive smile is earned." We've been fortunate that when
something has been taken away, we've been in a position to take advantage
of an opportunity, which is luck. Doors close and you scramble around and
you try to find something else. So far, we've been able to do that,
although last year we lost a big part of our budget. With last year's
budget, we figured we lost over a third because we lost funding from the
National Endowment. But now it's back up to what it was before. Our grant
from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund helped us leverage money from
the other foundations in town. And the Lannan Foundation has helped us out
with funding for programming for a second year, which is really great. And
we're trying different fund-raising techniques.
KG: We're involved in a really big project right now. They're building a
big convention center downtown. We sold them on the idea that a Wisconsin
convention center ought to be different than any other by having the words
of our own writers on the walls.
AK: It's a four-block convention center. It will be the biggest one in the
state. We submitted a response to the public arts and we were the top
proposal that was accepted. We're putting in the work of between fifty and
seventy-five writers, historical and contemporary, throughout the
building. It's not going to be painted on the walls because they will
eventually have to be repainted, of course. So the letters will be raised
or etched in glass or cut into the wood. Words from Wisconsin writers or
ones that had substantial connections to Wisconsin. That was and is a big
project. So we have that money But since the budget was reconfigured,
we're going to end up doing a lot of the work without compensation because
we want the project to be successful.
KG: When we first started our programming here, and it carries right
through to this project for the Midwest Express Center, we always said
that we should pay writers that we brought in for readings. We've always
made sure we've had enough to pay people's way, but normally more than
that. This may be the first project in the country of it's kind where
people are actually getting paid for their writing.
RCF: Have you ever done much with mail order? Do people come here and
recognize your store as a place to get poetry and then order via the mail?
AK: We've been working on that. Years ago we received funding for two
years under the Community Development Block Grant. They gave us money for
computers and an inventory program and a  half-salary to do this. We have
all the inventory on computer, which is twenty- seven thousand titles
right now with fourteen pieces of information on each title, for cross-
referencing. So you could call and all we have to do is look it up and
send it out. The second step for us was to create annotated lists of
ethnically specific areas. We don't have an annotated list of the poetry
because it's just too huge. But we do have lists for Native American,
Asian/Asian American, Africa/African American/Caribbean, and
Hispanic/Latino. This information is available at no cost to people who
ask for these catalogs. There's a lot of information in them. They've gone
to almost every state in the union, plus Japan and Norway. We also get
orders from tribal libraries across the country. There is some mail order,
but we would not exist on mail order. It's sort of a supplement to the
mission of letting people know what's available.
KG: It has actually become quite a substantial part of our book sales.
We've been working hard at that and it will improve some more. Pretty soon
we're going to have a web page. We can generate a catalog on demand and
that's what we'll do, so that it's up to date.
We had the opportunity to become a distribution company at one point and
just do a traditional kind of mail-order distribution. But I thought it
was really important for some kid to be able to walk in the store and find
his way. I think it's really important for there to be a point of contact.
Maybe that will happen more and more on the web, I don't know.
AK: We would like to use the internet to reach those people who would be
interested in what we have but don't know about us. It never made sense
for us to do an expensive catalog for two copies of something that was
$1.95. But over the computer you can just enter it or take it out.
RCF: How many readings do you sponsor in a year, poetry and fiction?
KG: The most we've ever done in a year was eighty. But that was eighty
readings, music performances, exhibitions, whatever.
AK: We do between forty and fifty public events annually. And that
includes gallery openings and music events, but the majority of our events
are readings. Some are invited national readers coming in, some are
regional, some are local. And then we have things like our classes. They
have a reading at the end of a class.
RCF: What are these classes? And who teaches them?
AK: We have writing classes for kids, teenagers, and adults. We have a
group of people who are teaching. If someone wants to teach a class, they
would send a proposal to us. If it looked pretty good we would work out a
percentage payment with that person. We would then advertise it and we
would run a class.
RCF: Do you track the amount of people who come in for the readings and
performances?
AK: Yes. We track the number of people coming in. We have exhibits running
all the time.
KG: We've had all kinds of exhibits, although we're moving more and more
towards having people who have done books or are involved with book art.
In the spring we're going to have a show by the Waldrops, Keith and
Rosmarie.
RCF: Why did you move into the least likely neighborhood in Milwaukee?
AK: Many of our decisions have been both philosophical and pragmatic.
Philosophically, what's the point of moving next-door to the university
when there are so many commercial bookstores as well as university
bookstores? There's not as great a need. We wanted to be where there
wasn't something. Pragmatically we could afford the location, so it worked
together.
KG: And it's close enough to the university and a lot of university people
live in the neighborhood. It's low rent. It's an old working-class
neighborhood.
RCF: How would you describe your role in the community?
AK: I would say that ideally our role would be that of a catalyst. We're
putting people together with literature and we hope that something special
is going to happen. You may come in and say, "Well I really don't like
poetry but I'm interested in baseball." And I could pull out Tom Clark's
book on baseball. You might suddenly think that poetry wasn't just
something that you hated in public school and was boring and was for
ladies with teacups. There are these preconceptions of what it might be.
Our role mainly is to put people in touch with their interests so they can
say, "This is part of my life and poetry can be part of my life and it's
dealing with subject matter I'm interested in." You start where a person
is. If they like one thing, you can show them something else. I really
believe a lot of it has to do with exposure. When people first come into
the new music concerts we're having, especially the improvisational
concerts where nothing is notated and it isn't necessarily melodic or
rhythmic, some people say "This is awful." But after you've heard it you
start saying, "I like this better than that." You start making judgments
on experience instead of an uneducated conception. I think our role is to
be a matchmaker between people and books. Because we are nonprofit we are
able to do that. Everybody who works here-and our tastes are widely
different-has a commitment. They have their own enthusiasm.
RCF: Is Woodland Pattern a model for what others could do in other places?
     AK: I think every place has it's own kind of need. That's what makes
all the literary centers different because they're responding to their
community. You could have people that have equal commitment, but they have
different interests so it would take a slightly different spin. It really
has been a part of our lives. It's something that you wake up in the
middle of the night with or you poke your partner when they're trying to
go to sleep and start bringing up these conversational things. It is your
life. In a sense, that's really a fortunate situation because you don't
spend a lot of your life doing a job while you spend a little of your life
doing what you want to do.
KG: We didn't start out from the standpoint of wanting to be a commercial
bookseller. We were plopped into a situation where it was already turning
towards a nonprofit grant world. That's fortunate-and unfortunate because
it shouldn't be necessary. In some ways we've been sort of straddling. You
can't just decide what you're going to do based on what people are willing
to fund, which is what a lot of people do. They may not die out but they
don't look like themselves after a month.
AK: We've also had an amazing piece of luck and I don't know that that
credit has been given. But one of the reasons we were able to survive at a
certain time was because of David Wilk's Truck Distribution.
KG: David and I got to be good friends. We used to drive up to Minneapolis
and I would go into his basement, which is where he was running his
distribution project. We worked out a deal because he was trying to get
the books out, too. He was committed the same way we were. He would put
things in our store on consignment. We were able to have a lot more books
in the store than we had bought. At one point, between David and a lot of
other friends who would consign stuff to us, the stock was about
two-thirds consigned because there was no other way.
AK: When the distribution changed hands and turned into Bookslinger, it
grandfathered in. I think we were probably the only account that they sent
books on consignment-but of course that's not happening anymore.
Consignment allowed us to have a range of things that we didn't know were
wonderful but if you don't know it and you don't have a lot of money,
where are you going to put your money? Because we ve had those books, we
know we want to keep having them. But we've also built up our finances.
KG: Another good piece of luck is that we were always profoundly aware of
our ignorance. There were two things that came out of that. One was that
if we found a press that published a book we liked, we would order pretty
much the whole catalog. We would let the editors make our choice for us.
The other thing was that we had to trust friends from the beginning. Karl
Young and Tom Montag would go through catalogs with me. We would choose to
order that way. But it wasn't by committee. Karl had one set of tastes and
I respected him. Tom had another set and I respected him and anybody in
town that I respected had another taste and if they wanted to go through
the catalogs and mark things I would order them. In that way we could
build up a store that wasn't made up of  just one sensibility.
RCF: How does that work now?
AK: The same way. We all have input. People can come in and suggest
things. Whenever a writer comes through Karl always asks them, "Who are
you reading? Who are you interested in?" If it's not someone we have on
hand, then we make sure we order them. Lately we've had a lot of it on
hand, which is really nice. But there is still so much we don't know. We
just keep asking.
RCF: Who had the idea for your promotional mailings?
KG: That was a practical thing. At one point it was cheaper to do it that
way. It's not cheaper to do it that way anymore. We were holding these
events by people that no one knew anything about, which was the whole
point of doing them. The way we do our reading series is that we feel
somebody is an important writer, we bring him into town and then acquaint
people in town. So say you're having this event by Paul Metcalf. You can
send out a press release saying he is the great-grandson of Herman
Melville and you can put it in a calendar and maybe get it announced in
the paper and maybe get yourself and your wife and some friends and Paul
Metcalf to come. Or you can ask Paul to send you some stuff that hasn't
been published yet and put it in the brochure with a little biography and
so on. I wanted to do that for each individual person because it seemed
like a way to honor them.
I've always hated getting stuff in the mail where I had to keep the whole
thing because there was only one thing I was interested in. So I thought
if you have this thing and it's not tied together with staples or
something people could open it up, go through the envelope and throw
everything away except the one thing they were interested in and put that
on their refrigerator. The other thing was that printers always have
pieces of paper that they cut off to make specific lengths. We developed a
relationship with our printer where we could go in and check their waste
and design stuff to fit it.
AK: Now our mailing list has grown and it's a lot harder to print cutoffs
because it's harder to get three thousand pieces of whatever it was. We
have gone to a self-mailed flyer for the majority of the newsletters and
things we're sending out because it costs the same whether you're doing a
small piece or whether you're doing a big piece. They don't want to throw
this stuff away if it can be used. We're trying to save money and we're
trying to work around what they have.
KG: We used to do a mailing for every single event. But then when we
started having two or three events in a month, even in those days when it
would be cheaper, it would become really time consuming and expensive, let
alone counting the time staff puts into it. Now we would have a whole
bunch of odd sheets and we could just stuff them in a brown envelope and
mail the whole thing.
RCF: Do you think everybody in Milwaukee who should know about Woodland
Pattern does know? If not, how much does that bother you and what do you
do to try to change that?
KG: We've done all kinds of different things. We used to have a
dial-a-poem service, but that finally died a couple of years ago. I would
record a reading or I would read a poem. And we had an answering machine
and we would put that on there and they would get that as a greeting
instead of "How are you? Call me back when I'm home." We ran that for
about fifteen years. That was the reason we started recording the
readings.
AK: We have chosen to put our money into the programming and into the
newsletter rather than buying adds. The publicity we get is community
listings. But because we've been around so long we have a pretty decent
working relationship with certain people at the newspaper. They're not
going to do a big article on every event, but we re getting some coverage
now, so that's okay.
KG: It's really hit and miss though. We don't have somebody who trusts us
the way we want to trust other people. So we can't get regular attention
for all the writers that come through.
RCF: What about radio attention, NPR? Do you get any attention from them?
KG: Barely. Very little. We've worked at that hard from time to time. I
think what we're going to do if we can afford it is to start being a
donor, as Woodland Pattern, to public radio so that they have to put
something on the air and then maybe we can persuade them to use our tapes.
AK: Our goal is for Woodland Pattern to reach a point where we would be
recognized as a major cultural institution in the literary arts. Now that
doesn't mean we would be downtown in a glamorous edifice. We want the
literary arts to be taken as seriously as the symphony. We're not an
alternative, we're the thing. We're not an alternative to something else
for literary arts; there isn't anything else.
KG: We're a public institution. The "public" literary institutions have
basically been the university English departments. But they're not really
public. And they're not really user friendly. When Anne was involved with
the university, we both had decided that the university had become a kind
of a priesthood, all these people were speaking in a specialized language
to each other. I was pretty disillusioned already. And I wasn't finding
any better stuff there, up until we moved to Milwaukee, than I was finding
in the commercial bookstores.
The reason I got into the position at Boox, Incorporated was that I had
taken a class with Jerry Rothenberg, who was here at University of
Wisconsin at Milwaukee. So in two years I basically went from rereading
Williams to seeing live John Cage and Jerry Rothenberg, Charlie Marrow,
Gary Snyder, David Antin, Jackson Mac Low, Jack Higgins, and Allan Kaprow.
All these people were coming to the university, but I just had this
feeling that we didn't want to be part of it. They can do what we do any
time they want to and they can do it better but they won't.
RCF: Do you work with the university at all?
KG: We're trying to work with teachers for textbooks. Actually one of the
members of our board is a special-collections librarian. He's ordering
hooks from us (we've be en assured that that's not a conflict of
interest). When we have writers come through, their books will end up in
that collection. And if they're book people, they might give a talk at one
of the university's book forums.
AK: It works better when it's person-to-person so that there are people
over there in the university that we work with on an individual level and
then they use their connections there.
KG: Like Native American studies. Kim Blaeser is a very good fiction
writer and poet at University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee. We cosponsor some
writers with her. They'll come into town to work with her and then we'll
have a public event.
AK: We supply a lot of books for Native American studies. A lot of
students come to Woodland Pattern to buy books for their Native American
classes. We have a good Native American section. But then the money we
make from those books is almost always turned over into bringing a writer
that fits that particular group. Maybe the money you spend here can turn
into a writer for your class. That works out for both of us.
KG: Our new idea is to have a literary center in the schools, to have
somebody there to bring writers in when they come to us.
AK: We're now working with one high school-this is part of our Lila
Wallace proposal- Marquette University High School. This happens to be a
private high school but there is a teacher there who is really interested
in expanding her kids' experiences beyond the normal classroom. She's
taking them to readings. She's taking them to plays. Because we met she is
now assigning them to come to several readings at Woodland Pattern. And
they're going to write or draw responses to these experiences. Now she's
broadening her curriculum to work with other faculty members in the arts
and music. Then they're going to come back to Woodland Pattern and do a
public presentation of what they got from the semester. It's for the kids
that they want to come. I think anytime you say, "You forty people have to
go somewhere" you're going to get people who are not as interested. But
the ones who are interested are the ones who are going to come and then
they will respond.
RCF: By working with high-school students you begin teaching them about
how you go into a bookstore, and how to feel comfortable in them.
AK: The other thing is, at least in the arts, and I won't generalize for
every city, but in Milwaukee the major core audience for the ballet, the
symphony, the theater, is an aging audience. It's people in their forties
and above. They're trying to reach a younger audience, and that's not that
far off from us. We want to reach into another generation of readers and
writers. One of the things that may make us a little different from some
of the other centers is that we've always felt that the reader was an
important part of the center. Some of the other centers are very much
writer-oriented and that's not bad. But now they're seeing that maybe they
need to connect the writer and reader. That's something we've always felt
was really obvious. We want younger readers to get involved. If you get
younger readers, you'll get younger writers because there is going to be
some overlap there.
RCF: If Barnes and Noble moved in down the street from you, what effect
would it have? I've always thought of Woodland Pattern as a model for how
a chain really couldn't compete. It seems if a Borders or Barnes and Noble
opened up near you, your business would increase because they wouldn't
have a number of poetry books that you have and they would send customers
down the street to you.
KG: We do have relationships with those people out of necessity, somewhat.
It's not necessary for us to carry some things, some of the really
mass-market things by writers that might be of interest to many people. We
can save our money on that by sending those people to Barnes and Noble and
likewise for them.
AK: Actually, we have a good working relationship with every bookstore in
town. They know they can send people to us. They know what we have. Even
Barnes and Noble will send people over. That's the advantage of their
hiring locally because they have local people that know what we have. But
we will also send other people to other bookstores and we might call to
make sure they have it on hand. The primary thing is service to people who
want to find whatever it is they want. For instance, we do not have a
spirituality section. But there is a bookstore in town that has a lot of
books that deal with that and we regularly send people. That works out
fine. They send people to us for what we carry.
RCF: If you could project ten years from now and if money were not a
problem, what would you be doing that you're not doing now?
AK: We'd be paying benefits to staff.
KG: I'd probably be working here for money instead of as a volunteer. I've
always kept my truck-driving job as a buffer against the rise and fall of
business.
AK: Whatever happens ten years from now is going to be different because
we'll both be ten years older and we need to find people who want to
continue on and there will be some overlap with what we are doing.
RCF: Are those younger people coming along?
KG: They're coming along now. Peggy Hong is the person who is running the
workshop program and getting workshops and writers into schools. She's
working half-time Lisa Corona was an intern last year from a little
college called Cardinal Stritch and now we re hiring her. She's really
good. She'll be working on audience development and financial management
projects. Carolyn Elmer does all of our ordering. She's a real book
person. Amy Hoffman is doing a lot of volunteer coordination. And Brooke
Barker does all of the work on our catalogs and does inventory work on our
computers.
AK: There may be new things that we don't see yet, but we've never had the
idea that we wanted to grow just to grow. We want to do what we do really.
really well and maybe make it deeper rather than wider. We don't know what
we don't know, so I'm not sure of what we're not doing that we haven't
thought of yet.
We would also like, I think, to maintain and keep a professional staff.
What we're finding is that younger people are in greater debt coming out
of school. I'm amazed at what students have to pay on student loans. It's
incredible. Bright, young, literary people, at this point, might not be
able to work for a place like Woodland Pattern because we can't afford to
pay the money they would need to pay for their education. We want to get
to a point where we can pay people like that, to pay people that would be
satisfied with making a lot less money than they could make in other
places. At this point, it's so much less-not compared to commercial
bookstores because bookstores notoriously don't pay well for general
staff-than other kinds of occupations or locations. You can have a
passion, but you still have to eat. Especially if you have a family. Those
are things you take into account. We've been really fortunate with the
people who are on the floor now with us. But I don't know if we can expect
the next generation to subsidize the center the same way the current
generation has been subsidizing it with wages and no benefits and stuff
like that.
RCF: How important is it that Woodland Pattern continue after both of you
are retired or gone?
KG: I don't know. Obviously it's important to me to have it be here, and I
think for Anne as well, just for our own education. If it isn't, then
people will be back where they were.
AK: I would like to see it continue but that will kind of depend on who
wants to see it continue past us. We can do what we can but we can't force
it. We're not going to be able to make someone have the same feeling for
it. It will depend on the demand.
RCF: One of the theories about publishers is that they have their own
special, limited time. You can look back at Barney Rosset at Grove Press.
In some ways he got absorbed by commercial publishing which could then do
the books that he broke the ground for. I don't know that the same thing
applies to what you're doing; that it's so dependent upon the time in
which it was happening, that you only do something really unique for a
while and then you become like everybody else.
KG: That's a good question because we've always tried to fill a kind of
cultural gap. My reason for doing this was because, traditionally, you
would only find out about a writer after they were already dead. The ones
I was interested in were the ones whom I would find out about after they
were gone. I think that finding writers is still going to be necessary
whether of not we do it or whoever replaces us. I think someone will find
a way to be a conduit.
    AK: What we've tried, and what I hope continues, is to make people
aware of the number of choices that they have amongst all these titles,
all these writers. And as Karl said, emphasizing a current group of people
who are writing rather than people who are gone. Classics are wonderful
and they're classics because they're really good.
KG: But they're classics because they had an audience in their own time.
AK: And we want to encourage people, in a sense, to find the classics of
now and to have the chance to speak with these writers. Some of the really
exciting things that we've had the privilege of being part of is
introducing a writer to a publisher and have something come out of it.
Sometimes it ends up being a book a year or two years later. It's exciting
to know that that happened in our living room or at Woodland Pattern, to
see those kinds of connections being made. So maybe when Karl or I aren't
here anymore, it will stop for whatever reason and it will be an
encapsulated, special time. But I'm hoping that it can continue. And it
won't be the same, it wouldn't be the same. No one is going to be our
clones. So it will be different with whatever, whoever it is that cares
about it.
RCF: Could you imagine some student who is interested in books coming here
to study what you're doing and then going off to wherever that person's
from to start something very similar? Because what you have set up really
is, in my experience, unique. Perhaps someone who could look at what
you've done, study what mistakes you may have made, how you would have
done certain things differently, and go off and do their own thing or make
a variation on it.
KG: Sure. I could see that, but there would probably have to be a Borders
or a Barnes and Noble or an independent bookstore there, too. There would
have to be other resources for the kinds of books we don't sell. What
we've tried to do here is fill in the cultural gaps. If a graduate student
were to start up something like Woodland Pattern, if would be because they
have something that they're interested in and that they want to share, but
also to fill a gap that exists in their community. Someone night be able
to do what we're doing where there really isn't any kind of resources at
all. I think it depends on the needs or wants of the community. We almost
always have one or two people here at Woodland Pattern, employees or
otherwise, that are reading the store carefully No one has gone off and
created another literary center, but they've done other things, like
magazines. What we think Woodland Pattern could become is a place where
you can find a writer and that writer's sources, the writers he or she
read.
AK: I think what you might find is unique about Woodland Pattern has to do
with us being a literary center rather than a bookstore.
KG: And the readings being a literary activity and not a booksale
opportunity.
AK: We're thrilled if we sell books when the writer comes through but the
writer is not considered a commodity. They're coming because they're doing
something important and we want to share them and whatever they're writing
about, with our community.
KG: Our readings haven't been directly tied to book publications. Now it's
more and more likely that it would be connected to the publication of a
particular book, but it's not probable. It happens more regularly now but
I bet you eighty percent of our readings have nothing to do with a new
book. Maybe more than that. If it has to do with a book it's probably a
happy accident. If we hear somebody is on a book tour, like with Curbstone
or Coffee House or some other press, or if somebody contacts us and
they're going to be on a book tour and they want to read at our place,
then it would be connected with a particular book. But it would happen
because we were already interested in them.
AK: That's true. We're at a point now where we do get a lot of inquiries
from people coming through. We can't do all the readings that people ask
us to do, at least not the way that we're doing them now. Each reading,
each event is special. We really do try to build an audience for each
event and not just throw them out there.
RCF: Do you have any sense of how many people become buyers of books in
your store because they've been to the readings or vice versa?
KG: One of the things that's different about us is that we charge
admission to readings. The only other places that do that are places like
the Art Institute. Most of the universities have them for free and
students are required to attend anyway. People would pay their admission
and the books would be there and they would think, "Well I already did my
job." But now more and more people are buying books, maybe because of the
Barnes and Noble readings. Just before every reading I say, "You have the
opportunity to do what you should do in the presence of a writer which is
buy their books."
RCF: Do you think that your customers first come to the store to buy books
or first come to the readings?
AK: It cuts both ways. It really does because, in a sense, for each
reading we get a different kind of audience and I can use Walter Mosley
and Kenneth Koch as two examples. With Walter you might obviously get
people who are interested in him because he's a mystery writer. And then
you get people who are interested in him because he's a black writer, so
people in the black community want to come and support that. And then you
get people who are interested in him because he's a big name. And then
maybe you get some people who are core who just want to come to a reading,
trying things out. Some of those people would only come because it was
Walter at Woodland Pattern and then they would buy a book. But it would
also be because someone would be there and find out about it and then come
to the reading. So it goes both ways. As for Kenneth Koch, there are a lot
of people who know him in the educational field because of his teaching
books. But then there are those that know him as a poet and they will come
to hear his poetry.
KG: He is somebody who came because the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund
paid his way on a tour. I don't think we ever could have invited him on
our own. It turned out to be a really interesting reading.
AK: So there is a case of maybe you wouldn't have selected a person
but once they're here you're really glad they came.
RCF: Do you establish relationships with a lot of the people you bring in
to read?
KG: We hope to. You always want to. That's really interesting and that's
the part that's really been difficult, psychologically I suppose, to know
how much of a relationship you have and if it's strictly a business
relationship. With literary relationships it's a lot tougher to make the
distinction. It turns out that not very many of them are not more than
business. If you can't offer another reading or whatever, then a lot of
the times the relationship goes away. If you have a project that involves
them, there is a relationship.
AK: I think, because we don't really want to treat a writer as a
commodity, that some of them are willing to come back when it's less
convenient for them. That's a good thing. And there are people who might
stop by when they don't have a reading in town or just to say hi. It
becomes a friendship that grows out of this other thing. But we always try
to have a good time with a person coming through. So you're not just
waiting at the hotel until we take you to your reading. Walter enjoyed his
reading with us before when he was brought through with the Lila Wallace
touring project, even though he can always read at some of the commercial
places. Actually, last time he was in town he read at the library, which
was a huge event. I talked to his agent and she said that she would like
to have him in our thirty by thirty room. Every other city is having him
in these huge auditoriums but she said, "No, that's where he wants to
read. With you." Because that's what he wants to support.

Regarding the poetry/politics plexus:  has anyone thought much about poetry
and art as a contribution to noise?  May sound ironic coming from the
Official Loudmouth himself.  And this is not a subtle attempt to suppress the
femmes.  I am glad for multiplicity here & so graciously always bend low the
orb & sceptre of Henrygemony.

I wonder about the ability to hear, apprehend, and respond.  And if "get
your act out there" is always politically liberating.  I talked once a
few months back about a quiet homemade reserved shy private approach to
this art form.  That has come up in recent threads with the talk about
people who don't send out their work.  Imagine a solidarity not based on
ideology so much as on a practice of shy collaborators, extremely local.
Who try to focus on hearing what a writer's doing in depth.  A lot of
what's "out there" seems to celebrate surface, edge, superficiality,
topicality, immediacy, power, and stuff like that there.  What if it takes a
different kind of hearing?

A lot of writers, or perhaps moreso wannabe and would-be-if writers, are
definitely co-opted and even brain washed into the cult of Happy Word. If
they join the cult of Happy Word, and make nothing but joyful noises, they
get something published as their reinforcing reward to do more of that same.

That is somewhat likenable to the franchise served Happy Meal, but definitely
more ideological than cardboard sandwiches in styrofoam packaging....

In other words, I think you understated that bit about superficiality.

There, another stroke of brilliance....

Another edition that does not decompose on its own after the wrapper is
removed from the vacuum pack, but one that is made of kitty litter. Yes,
the very pages crumble up as they are read into useful, recycled, kitty litter.

After all, how many people actually read the same book of verse twice ?

Did someone on the list ask about Ron Padgett's book "Creative Reading" a
few week (possibly months) ago? You might have got your answer but I did
find the book while looking at others things in the library. It is
published by the NCTE (who also did Rasula's Wax Museum [someone there
must an intelligent editorial policy]).  This book sits on the shelf next
to books on how to teach Johnnie to read, but its approach is totally
refreshing--kind of like Kenneth Koch on how to teach children poetry (the
book is dedicated to Koch in fact).  Lots of Oulipo style games and
techniques and a discussion of reading "errors."  I sure hope some
teachers of "reading" at all educational levels find this book.

My next money-making scheme:  an anthology entitled "Language poetry for
Children."

Sorry to post again in such rapid succession but I couldn't resist.

I used one of Padgett's "creative reading" which consists simply of making
a list of nouns and then substituting them for the words in an unrelated
text.  This is the result of my transformation of a Merwin poem.  It made
me realize how unsurrealist much "deep-image" surrealism really is:

he says my orchid
said maybe
you have important turn you are doing
or maybe you should be seeing
incongruity I dont want to keep you

I look out the man
my bebop is older than I am
he says and I told my orchid it was so
and I got up and left him then
you know

though there was business I had to go
and immoralist I had to do

i was thinking conformity in the ralph waldo emerson conform to society or
group or whatever way. but even in speech: each person brings his/her own
set of connotations into the conversation, whether they want to or not. so
you are making the attempt to conform (just as in person trying to take up,
say, christianity) but your individual integrity is still maintained via
your individual perceptions.
and so: what i was getting at: the problem is the attempt to conform to
stuctures. it is the attempt to try to be like someone/thing else. the
attempt to deny your individuality. (of course, the attempt to communicate
is not neccessarily a negative attempt, but it can be.)
so: my hope is that if people begin to realize that they can not conform,
they will 1) rely on themselves more; and 2) be more open to other people's
ideas, etc.
ahh... idealism. =)

Dodie--I think that is an excellent screening process and am not
surprised that it works as a filter.

I was curious about your comment about no longer being a feminist.  I
often feel like a bad feminist myself but I don't think anything to
drastic has changed in me--I'm just more willing to be vocal about all
of me, pervert and feminist.  Can you enlighten??

Subject:      Reading Notely's Disobedience
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

K. Ledrer's recent post of Alice Notley's "The Poetics of Disobedience",
recalls another Notley paper: "Epic & Women Poets" which appeared in
"Disembodied Poetics: Annals of the Jack Kerouac School" (University of New
Mexico Press, 1994). The following text is excerpted from a review I wrote
for Sulfur:



Any language or materially-oriented approach to writing is formidably
challenged in Alice Notley's, "Epic & Women Poets" -- one of this
anthology's riskier essays in its assertion that "to break and recombine
language is nothing" and that "dreams are not language; they are fleshy and
vivid, they are 'real.' And they are 'about' us & everything; both the
source and paradigm of art. They are the bed of new beginnings, the place to
turn." Proceeding against the margins of what the Twentieth Century
discourse of language and literature, from Naropa to France, has been about
-- (1) the elimination of the subject from language; the deconstruction of
language as mimesis of human nature, presence, vision and voice; (2) the
critique of the unconscious as the production of desire via the
interpretation and use of dreams to cure neuroses or create illusions of
self-realization -- Notley discards "language" as a male-dominated,
over-determined, dead system. Accordingly, the writing (and reading) of
poetry is no longer an exploration of systems of language -- a new way of
writing, traceable to Stein through the Objectivists, and to today, via the
Language School, that was (and still is) tired of the over-explanation and
hegemony of the subject (regardless of its gender), that sought (and still
seeks) to make of writing an action, conscious of the fact that what is
internal to what is called action is that it does not know itself (which
suggests the heart of Buddhism or Su=F1=F1at=E3 -- voidness: all things,=
 without
any exception, especially, the self). For Notley, whatever "language" was is
back to being about the author and the author's dreams, which as Notley
asserts, are "more real" than language.=20



I would add today, moreover, in light of the Disobedience text, that
Notley's strategy involves the self in a literalization of the gap between
saying and doing. I would equate her two worlds, the "ideal crystalline" one
and the "supposedly real" one, with saying and doing, respectively -- This
oscillation as a line of escape from perpetually false forms and discourses
to "fundamental justice" which is at some point embodied in the act of
writing itself, which is only a vehicle for self-realization and coming to
terms with "death and responsibility," or "not believing and telling the
truth as it comes up" -- historically and politically it is both this
revelation, and much more seriously, a mutation in the natural dimension of
Western culture: the end of history in the sense in which it is secretly
implied by Notley.=20
