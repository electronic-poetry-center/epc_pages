The form increases in length; I did not know about this limit, and then it
was of course too late. So the replies are stuttered, and I want to thank
everyone who has written here. And my reply is stuttered as well and there
is a Holderlin-call from the Japanese translation by Rexroth at the end,
which doesn't clarify, but mutes.

------------------------ Rejected message (50 lines) --------------------------
Subject: Japonisserie

As I've said, please check the URLs. I am not making any claims about
"Nikukos in Japan," about the "Japanese," about Japanese culture. I
am writing texts which look at issues ranging from avatars through
psychoses, etc. There are politics involved, but not claims. A few years
ago I wrote "through" thinking about cuneiform; I was interested in
language diffusions as well as the granularity of the real. These inter-
ests play a role here.

I remain blind to the possibility that Nikuko is a stereotype of anyone
or anything. I cannot imagine a classroom of Nikukos, or that being in
Japan for six years instead of six months would have changed what I was
doing in this respect. Nikuko is very similar to Julu in a lot of re-
spects; I have limited imagination, but the very fact that I do not know
Japanese, do not know kanji, opened up the possibility of a world of
impervious signs, and a probe thereby.

Possibly misrecognition has resulted from sending only a certain section
of poems/poetics to Poetics; the other essays, etc., have been omitted.

If I were writing in a future six-year stay, I would have kept Nikuko, and
reminded myself of the ignorance of the language. The writing has been
concerned with epistemology, what's knowable under the circumstances of
probes and membranes and systems. It hasn't been concerned at all with
geisha.

The reason I brought up PC is based on some of the critique coming in. If
someone recognizes her students as all Nikukos, that means what, for ex-
ample? That I should not write through a character I create? That if I do
write through such a character I should be critical because she sees her
as a type, and as a girl-geisha detrimental type at that? That I should
negate my own interest in pursuing this work - which again makes no claims
whatsoever about Japanese culture (I have been carefulabout that), and
perhaps use a Jewish white male my own age as exemplar, since that is
really all I "know" about?

This questions also touch on Yasusada's work, by the way - if the work is
Kent Johnson, and is, then what right does he have - along the same lines?
What right does right have? How is it right for what right?

If I write a Nikuko-X that seems harmless enough, without too much cultur-
al debris attached, I'll send it on. It is not only that I am concerned
with writing hurtful texts; I also don't want to create a male probe in
this regard, and worry it will be taken as such. Although Nikuko is "fe-
male," she is not female, and that would indeed be a misappropration as
far as I'm concerned. (One might say just as well that she is "Japanese"
but not Japanese. I realize I'm getting away with murder. Littoral.)

Finally, if Nada and others have different (or similar, since she recog-
nized Nikuko as a type?) experiences, why not write to those experiences,
instead of critiquing my own position from the viewpoint of perhaps mis-
placed (in)authenticity? (I.e. I was here or there longer than you, or I
know Japanese or say unix better than you, or whatever.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------


Here is a translation of a poem by 8th-century Yakamochi, by Kenneth
Rexroth:

The cry of the stag
Is so loud in the empty
Mountains that an echo
Answers him as though
It were a doe.

_Yama biko no
Ai to yomu made
Tsuma goi ni
Ka naku yama be ni
Hitori nomi shite_


And through this you see darling Nikuko how I call you through the wires,
rural electrification notwithstanding! For it is true that the echo com-
mand - in format {k:0} echo 'command' - behaves just as in Perl, that is,
the backward quotations enact command, then echo it onto the screen with-
out line returns, but a pure escapement, pure emission, pure thrust of
activation

so that I emit towards you this echo, this command, reverberating in the
midst of the mountains, creating you; your sound, scent, touch, envelop me
and you sense my presence as I echo back to you, your wish is my 'command'

so that you emit towards me this echo, this command, reverberating in the
midst of the mountains, creating me; my sound, scent, touch, envelop you
and I sense your presence as you echo back to me, my wish is your
'command' . . .

btw, i'm pleased that personal quotas have now been instituted for the

This has been great!  Let it fly!

I want to say that a b-c from Bobbie West has sobered me up some. I got
called on my  W,M p-o-v. Indeed, a comfortable one, at least out here in
the Bleachedburgs. If I were a male-terrorized female--if that isnt a
redundancy--I'd have a much harder time detaching from the content of some
of Alan's poems.

I also want to say that Nada was not censoring, she was expressing.

This matter of detaching from content : I recall playing a tape of Robert
Duncan reading his boffo poem "My Mother Would Be A Falconress" and a male
student said, very much aroused, "That guy is _sick_ . He _hates_ his
mother." Well of course, Sophistication answers. But this student was
_getting it_ in a way I wasn't. Maybe he was recoiling from a picture of
his own subconscious, who am I to know?

There are going to be texts, for any one of us, where we cannot achieve an
esthetic distancing because the content is traumatic. And surely our saying
so is part of the Grand Testimony that would allow whatever form and
content in poetry?

This, then, is to apologize for the bleakness of my response (though not to
retract the argument offered. Certainly not to ask Alan to change a thing).

PS in the same class, one wag suggested--this being during one crest of the
wildlife protection movement--that the falcons should sue RD for his
misrepresenting them and for personifying them.

Alan,

Thanks to digest mode I'm always behind the list discussion, so
I never posted my reaction to your Nikuko IRC post some weeks
ago.  I loved it.

It gave me an idea, though.  Couldn't someone program a
Nikuko generator that takes a given text (as Nikuko did in your
post) into an IRC discussion, speaks bits of it & mixes those bits
with what other people are saying?  It's been awhile, so I can't
remember if you started doing this or if Nikuko just stuck to her
text... but I remember that some of what the other IRC identities
were putting out could've mixed interestingly with Nikuko.  I also
think Nik should've hung in there a bit longer; folks were just
beginning to react.

Just an idea.

Keep posting your work.

        That's the first I'd been aware of a five message per day limit.
When was that instituted? I would much rather have the list members use
moral suasion, boycotts, the delete, or whatever, to influence the
cyberhogs. It seems to me that when there's a useful debate, such as that
surrounding Alan Sondheim's work, it should be able to run its course. Run
without hobbles.
        Bromige, I take your note of support for the limit to be
ironic--that you are against it? (Careful, if you reply, that's one gone!)

this 5per day rule has been in place for a long time. I think about a
year, tho I cannot remember for sure. Many people on the list I think have
encountered this rule when posting frequently to the list. But five times
in a twenty-four hour period?? Granted, as Sylvester P. once wrote to me
backchannel, many people like to read the list in "real-time" as it
happens,and I feel a certain amount of interest in that as well. However,
it seems to me that just as there could be a valuable conversation
happening such as the reading of Alan's work going on here, I can ALSO
imagine such an occurrence where someone might be let loose on the list in
a violent, or verbally agressive manner. Obviously the reality is
somewhere between these two. Certainly when people get so riled up that
they have to be "censored" by waiting til after midnight to respond, they
might be a few percentage points more likely to eventually require
restraint by more than the email police.  I think this contestedness is
good for the list, and for poetry & poetics as well, but it may not be the
best use of this forum, which combines interest in such "poetics"
with the amenities of the new media, such as immediacy & virtuality. But
that doesn't mean we need to maximize the possibilities offered by one at
the expense of another. The need to shape the list by limiting posts to
five a day is a decision based on the supposedly limited nature of this
list. If you don't like it, as they say, combine your posts into single
message. Sometimes it seems like everything would benefit if people would
slow down and read each other with more consideration. Sometimes it seems
like people end up arguing in public about "how I read you" and "how I
read you reading you" - sorry, but this does not a poetics make

end of managerial rant. I'll be waiting out behind the barn if you want to
duke it out.

I wanted to mention Nick's incredibly interesting post. I wanted to remark
on that because it seems funny that a post about feedback should go
without feedback, tho maybe I missed it. Also to add to his sense of
getting feedback at a reading, as the work encounters an audience, it's
audience or otherwise. Sometimes I feel treated as a listener to a sense
of a reading as an event, one which the author has prepared a special
statement to me as member of the community of listeners addressed. This
may involve "reading new work" - a public redress of work considered (in
the poetry lab) for some time. The worst readings are those where the
author is "simply" performing a "set list." Of course one can read a
statement of sorts into that, a relation to ones "readers" that may unveil
some whole other bag of wax. As a poet I've never been fond of poetry
readings, tho Nick's post makes me reconsider the prospect as I plan for a
July reading here in Buffalo with Stephen Cope and Wendy Kramer. Part
goodbye, part unlock, part letter to Creeley (everything here it seems,
even the lovely town of Buffalo, is a letter to R.C.) suddenly the
interest to give a reading is a very exciting prospect.

Thanks to everyone who posted to me publicly or privately about electronic
computer poetry softwares. I found several and will post my evaluation as
I come to it. They all offer different things. Electric Poet is the best,
I think, because it allows ENORMOUS text files as source text and spits
out relatively syntactic language. The rest is all craft, no? Hammering
out meaning and sense like the shield of Achilles, into, as Susan Howe
wrote, "fragmentary narrative enclaves"

Here is something I wrote yesterday using a source text processed by
Electric Poet:

Halfway across the doorway something terrible happened
Dorothy lived in the trap door, Dorothy lived in a corner
The sun had changed her, and gray as her horses were gray
as she screamed into the trap door into a cradle
He ran toward the child's accidents happen
She screamed the house broke the house broke the sheds
where the room came strange building
in a sharp whistling barking loudly
they heard the cyclone coming
the hours passed and gaunt the south winds met
to the far north carried miles in a cyclone cellar
the room contained a feather cookstove
a cupboard for the great pressure of the air

This is part of a long section of an ongoing project to affix private,
coded meanings, into randomized samples of processed language. Everything
here has a referential value, although there is no obvious set of
correspondences. And as a "control" there also meaningful linguistic
sequences of words and phrases that do not have any affixed, private
meaning, but are provocative as langague crashing on itself in collage.

As a text, this section of Canto10-The Cyclone is a reading of the
vocabulary of the first chapter of The Wizard of Oz. Rather, it "borrows"
"steals" "begs" these words off the original, taking with them full
resonsance of where they came from. It would be impossible to remove
Dorothy, just as "balloon" from her source in the Baum book, or more
likely, the 1939 film. By writing over the original, now lost in
compuerania, the oz of the book becomes a fragmented contemporary
allegorial meaning-generating device, not meaning "destructive" but
seeking Kansas in lyric statement, hid out, buried from the wind
and its caustic debris. Tack & tact.

Joel and I are on the same timescale of reply today, I guess, as I was
reminded to post the Welcome Message, as we do every month for those who
may not have it handy. You can check out the automatic list options by
looking at the header that comes when you request a list of subscribers
using the "review" command, as explained below. The "daily threshold" is
50;5: 50 overall and 5 for any one subscriber. As of today, there are 627
subscribers. There have been a number of discussions on the list in the
past about the reasons for setting these parameters in this way -- and
they all took place in the environment of a significantly smaller list.


I want also to take this chance to thank Joel for his work in bounced
message control and other list duties that keep this thing going. He does
everything that the "fully automated system" can't handle, i.e. quite a
lot --

                                New obstacles for exchange arise

                                Or unfold, O ye postmasters!



1. About the Poetics List


The Poetics List was founded in late 1993 with the epigraph above.


There are presently over 600 subscribers.


Please note that this is a private list and information about the list
should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is
to keep the list to those with specific rather than general interests,
and also to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume
manageable.


The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While
individual posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we
continue to work to promote the editorial function of this project. The
definition of that project, while provisional, and while open to
continual redefinition by list participants, is nonetheless aversive to a
generalized discussion of poetry. Rather, our aim is  to support, inform,
and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
**<color><param>ffff,0000,0000</param>We also encourage subscribers to
post information on publications and reading series that they have
coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear (see section 9
below).** (THIS MEANS *YOU*).

</color>

Please keep in mind that all posts go out immediately to all subscribers,
and become part of an on-line archive. *<italic>Posting to Poetics is a
form of publication, not personal communication</italic>.* Participants
are asked to exercise caution before posting messages! While spontaneity
of response may seem the very heart of the list at its best, it also has
the darker side of circulating ideas that have not been well considered
(or considered by another reader -- editor or friend). Given the nature
of the medium, subscribers do well to maintain some skepticism when
reading the list and, where possible, to try to avoid taking what may be
something close to a spontaneous comment made in the heat of exchange as
if it were a revised or edited essay ("Let the Reader Beware!").=20


The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein. Joel Kuszai is list
manager.  For subscription information contact us at
POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu.

2. Subscriptions


Subscriptions to Poetics are free of charge. But we ask that you
subscribe with your real name and we reserve the right to request
additional information, including address and phone number. All
subscription information you supply will remain confidential.


You can subscribe (sub) or unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line
message, with no subject line, to:


listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu


the one-line message should say:


unsub poetics


{or}


sub poetics Jill Jillway


(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your

name to unsub)


We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity. Please allow
several days for your new or re-subscription to take effect.=20


*


If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:


Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use
Eudora (an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites):
from the Tools menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending
Mail": you may be able to substitute your old address here and send the
unsub message.


The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages
may get bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned
to us. If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an
increase from your system administrator. (You may wish to argue that this
subscription is part of your scholarly communication!) You may also wish
to consider obtaining a commercial account.


In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your account, your
subscription to Poetics will be temporarily suspended. If this happens,
simply resubscribe to the list in the normal manner, once your account
problem has been resolved.


All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to the list's
administrative address: poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu. Please note that it may
take up to ten days, or more, for us to reply to messages.=20

____________________________________________________________________


3.  Cautions


Please do not post to the list personal or backchannel correspondence, or
other unpublished material, without the express permission of the author.
Copyright for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author;
material from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".


The Poetics List has a 50 message daily limit. If more than 50 messages
are received, the listserver will automatically hold those additional
messages until the list is manually unlocked, usually the following day.
While it is difficult to prescribe a set limit on the number of daily,
weekly, or monthly posts for any  subscriber, please keep this limit in
mind. If you plan to respond to multiple threads, it is generally
preferable to consolidate your reply into one message. While relevant
excerpts from a post to which you are responding may usefully be appended
to your reply, please do not include in your new post the whole text of a
long previously posted message.


Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a
post, since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via
"digest" or who cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.=20


In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also
become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry events
and publications are always welcome. (See section 7.)


Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.


If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or
supply information missing from an post, or thank someone for posting

Hi Nada!

Glad to have read your post. Although I'm not familiar with the poems
you're talking about, I think you raise a really important issue concerning
irony.

Recently I heard Bruce Andrews read and although I really enjoyed the work
(its rhythms and contortions and general force) enough to tell him so after
the reading, it was hard for me to see his use of words such as "pussy" as
ironic and unproblematic.

Actually, this is all very odd, I agree.  I don't *believe* the "welcome"
message we get frequently re-posted to us, which supposedly gives all the
ground rules, mentions the 5-post limit.  If I'm not mistaken, it gives
quite a different impression..I've looked, because in fact I first hit the
limit some months ago, so it has been operative (not just for me I
presume) for quite some time....

I never asked the list-honchos or the list in general about it, figuring I
was the only one stupid enuff not to have noticed the rule someplace...

Shouldn't the Welcome message (*if* I'm right) make mention of the limit??

This information is provided in the list "header" which is available to
list subscribers by request, most easily when you send the "review" command
to the listserv address. However, I do agree that it is a good idea to
include this also in the Welcome message and so I have added it for the future.

Hugh sez re "Composer Webern was Double Agent for Nazis":
> I have strong doubts about whether this happens to be true

no doubt yr skepticism is fully appropriate - but what a wonderful
strategy for coping with the avant garde, eh? mebbe it won't be so
long we'll find something like this in the Times:

"Florida State University Prof Establishes Poet's Link to Terrorists

Tallahassee - What would you think of an 'avant garde' poet whose
work was actually useful for something? ridiculous, right? but that's
just what Professor David "Genital" Kirby is proposing. "That's
right," sez Professor Kirby, "I have found incontrovertible evidence
that American poet Jack Spicer's use of the 'serial form' can be
linked directly to the need to pass information securely from the San
Francisco bay area to Berlin."
        Professor Kirby's controversial paper, delivered before some 150
of his peers at the recent Florida State Conference of the Literary
Arse [sic], proposes that Spicer's otherwise incomprehensible poetry
was actually a complex code employed for trans-continental
communication leading to terrorist activity in the U.S. and abroad.
Kirby links Spicer to an openly homosexual splinter group of the
Red Army Faction, headquartered in the famous Berlin leather bar
Der Vesuvius. "While it's true I haven't read any of Spicer's work or
his lectures or his biography, I'm absolutely convinced that my
conclusions are correct. I think he even wrote a poem or something
called 'Three Marxist Essays.'" Professor Kirby asserts that "it's
particularly important to get the word out now, when a resurgence of
interest in Spicer's outlandish work could only mean a coming
resurgence of red terrorist activity."
        While several members of the audience had walked out by the
end of his presentation, Kirby is not discouraged. "There has to be
some explanation for Spicer's nonsensical verse, his bloated
egotism," says Kirby, who describes his colleagues as "just jealous"
that he has uncovered it.

Not to mention the fact that Schoenberg developed the 12-tone system around
1920, after Hauer and others had already developed similar systems.

A notice by Maria Margaronis in the May 29 TLS for two new titles by Karen
Van Dyck on contemporary Greek poetry:

        _Kassandra and the Censors: Greek Poetry since 1967_, 305 pp.,
Ithaca, NY: Cornell U Press (prices given in sterling)

and

        _The Rehearsal of Misunderstanding: Three collections by

Deep, by Jenny Mastoraki; Hers, by Maria Laina_ (Bilingual edition) 336
pp., Hanover NH: U Pres of New England / Wesleyan University Press (prices
in sterling)

From the review:

"The junta passed a law demanding that book titles correspond exactly to
their contents; a group of writers countered with a volume called simply
'Eighteen Texts'. The junta condemned American popular culture while
opening the gates to foreign imports and the CIA; poets and songwriters
exposed the Colonels' looking-glass logic in paeans salted with the names
of consumer durables. By the 1970s, direct parody had given way to
strategic playbacks of the regime's mixed messages, underlining the
writers' inevitable complicity in the culture they inhabited while
rejecting clarity as dangerous and tainted. In Greece, poetic difficulty
emerged not as a literary fashion but as an urgent response to a pressing
political situation."

while I'm at it, saw a documentary on Karadzic last night on PBS, at one
point, the ex-poet is surveying Sarajevo from the hills, accompanied by a
Russian poet, Limonov (?), they come to a sniper position, and Karadzic
shows Limonov how to work the high-powered assault weapon, which Limonov
fires into the city ..

Hello,

I read your post on the Buffalo poetics list and thought I might make
contact w/ you, and enquire about your call for chapbooks/submissions.
I have a chapbook-length "experimental" poem I've been working on, called
"Incomplete Catalog: Variations."  Portions of it have appeared in a
small-mag I co-produce here (Vancouver, BC) called "estrus".

Below is one "set" from the series.  Each "set" is composed of 3 five-line
"stanzas", which are variations of 10 words, linked by  two
alternating conjunctions or prepositions. The poem is partly informed by
Gertrude Stein's theories of composition.  Let me know if you'd like me to
send you more via snail-mail.

Yours,

Roger Farr



INCOMPLETE CATALOG: VARIATIONS 6-9

I am confused because many send their submissions email and well,
they are still coming in for the first issue which is half prepared

so if you sent somehting and I not hear yet, we are still reading...
it was long last semester busters!

July

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-transfer-encoding: Quoted-printable

=B6  Congrats to dbkk on the Examiner article!!
Congrats also for making Lingua Franca, and
without the trouble and muss of abusing any
impressionable students.

--------------------

=B6  Anybody out there familiar with a French band
by the name of "Kat Onoma"? I happened to notice
a page just now that mentions their second album,
Stock Phrases, which apparently "is based upon the
works of the American poet Jack Spicer".  !?

--------------------

=B6  It's great to see Alan's work being discussed and/or
argued here, I'm only sorry I didn't catch any of this over
the wkend when I would have had more time to digest it -
now I'm at work and comments have to be kept to a minim,
esp. as I've already 'wasted' some time today on poetix; not
to mention there's a 'net technical staff meeting going on right
outside my office, and the air is heavy with data and acronyms...

   Alan knows how I feel about his wrtg - working with
him to publish Jennifer has had a tremendous impact on
my thinking and on my own wrtg, which I haven't bothered
to conceal. I'm only now coming to really =3Dunderstand=3D parts
of his project (i.e., not just comprehend them intellectually);
other parts remain wholly unfamiliar to me. if I haven't digested
the work in its totality, that's only because it's composed of
variable intensities none of which are fully *comprehended
by the work itself, outward turnings and assemblings that
destroy and incompletely destroy the work's integrity - to my
reading, it's as a vase AND a handful of shards, and neither;
all of which aspects I think are necessary. I don't think I can
say more about this just now, other than to caution that I'm
not using Modernist (and decidedly not postmodernist, at
least in one of its aspects) terminology - i.e., not the same
atotality (ha ha Webern) proposed at that time.

  certainly there are aspects of the work that are disturbing
in the extreme, yes even traumatic. "handful of shards". the
project is dangerous - which is not just a way of excusing
offensive material. it should be pretty obvious, however anyone
feels about them, that the Nikuko poems aren't *synonymous
with JAPANESE SCHOOLGIRL ALL-ANAL ACTION etc. etc.
ad nauseum - though they obviously position themselves in
relation to this and other fetishizing discourses. possibly
we should remind ourselves that poetry can be an address
(to problems and to persons), and not just a 'symptom'.

to my thinking, Alan's work takes up quite deliberately and with
concern those aspects of it which most (ALL) of us find threatening -
subjects or persons as fetishized, dissolved, partial, becoming -n.
this runs in a continuum from the negative/terrifying to the
+/revolutionary; or, more than apt than a continuum, I'd say
that any 'single point' in these poems - any statement or idea -
positions itself in relation to these extremes and innumerable other
points, without being reducible to any of them. to read the work or
even any part of the work as 'just pornography' is to miss
innumerable other intensities; to read it as wholly 'revolutionary'
is equally a mistake. it's relation to the material is not *simply
ironic, and I'm not sure that its mode isn't too complex even for
the term "ironic".

        e.g., the (necessary) departure from EGO as a false wholism
manifests here in relation to technology as

                        EGO             >>>             machine
     person overcome/destroyed by machine, person automated
     and routinized; programmed (compliant), reified (made whole)

but that same departure, even at the same point manifests as

                        EGO             >>>             cyborg
     person as deconstr./assemblage with machine, person activated
     and transformative; revolutionary (noncompliant), transpersonal
     (composed of partial objects)

a similar, and possibly more troubling nexus occurs in relation to
(mostly sexual) desire, between the exploded ego and/or body as
fetishized/pacified AND/OR desiring/activated, where desire is
understood (as unfortunately  it so rarely is here) as a destructive
force. The accusation can be (has been) levelled that Alan fetishizes
women in his work prior even to the body of desire as it occurs
there - I've always been bothered by this to the extent that it
seems fully appropriate to say this of (we assume) a Man writing
about Women, but not for instance of Acker's work in relation to
'her' gender or Burrough's in relation to 'his', as if the work
doesn't announce itself anyway as trying to destroy 'natural'
categories like MAN and WOMAN, that last safe binary, saving grace.

(I can't emphasize enough that the enforcement of Gender as binary is
pervasive and accounts for the frightened neglect or misunderstanding
of some really great, risky stuff out there - not to mention the
painful, distorting effect it has on us as persons, trying to force
our desire/experience into rigid gender criteria, even if we're
"sophisticated" enough to parrot back the vocabulary of
constructivism...

        "William 's cuttin off his fingers so they'll fit into the glove".)

                - anyway,  I think that read is reductive in that it neglects
Alan's (the poems') keen awareness of "Alan" as another figure
constructed in/by his work - not author, not in control or variably
in control, not whole. Alan is as much Jennifer as he is the Alan,
I can see the Alan sometimes moving from Jennifer to Alan as
Julu and so forth in its identifications - but trying I think,
hardest of all NOT to identify or be identifiable.

        okay, a much longer post than I intended but I'm not sorry.
        obviously I'm partial to Alan's work (ha Ha) but I don't mean
        to invalidate anyone's response - only to reiterate and broaden
        Joe's remark to read further (farther? not father).

My name is Anthony Lawrence.
My address is: PO Box 75, Sandy Bay, Tasmania, 7006, Australia
I heard about the discussion group from the Electronic Poetry Centre
homepage on the Internet. Also, a friend of mine, Philip Mead
is a member.
My interest is discussing poetics and current trends in contemporary
poetry.
I read widely in American poetry, and this is an opportunity to interract
with and learn from some of those poets.

Sincerely,

Anthony Lawrence

months back of single author issues of magazines, I think these pages stand
as exemplary tributes to these authors; and with a million transactions a

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

This is a current (June, 1998) version of the EPC Author Page Call for
contributions:
=============================================
        We are asking people to consider contributing to the EPC author page
development initiative. We feel there are certain key authors who should
have a page at the EPC. Since you may also be working on/reading some
of these authors, helping to create their page might be a simple matter,
and might be a natural tie-in to ongoing research and/or writing projects.

        What is an author page? Our basic aim is to create a place where
links to resources in various web locations by and about the author might be
gathered. (Additionally, if the author would agree to notify me of future
web publications of their work, that would also be helpful.) In addition, in
an EPC author page, we often seek to make available some new-to-the-web
textual and/or visual resources, items specific to the EPC. But this is not
necessarily required.

        The basic requirements of such a page are a photo, a cv/list of
publications/ bibliography, brief bio, the above-mentioned textual work, and
the author's agreement to use their work. Files can be sent as attachments
to e-mail (include a list of file names in e-mail message) or mailed on
diskette. Also include links to any existing resources on the Web (available
through any number of search engines).

        An EPC author page does not require extensive knowledge of HTML.
Indeed, the core activity of such a page is to gather and compile materials
related to a given author; often this allows you the opportunity to contact
and work with someone in whose work you are interested. It is also a
valuable form of advocacy for writers who you believe should be read more
widely.

        The main purpose here is to develop a center where people might find
out more about these authors. Help us with this collective effort to develop
a body of content related to poetry that is available on the Web.

        A list of suggested authors whose pages need to be created or
developed follow. Have a look and let us know if you are interested or if
you have suggestions.

For further details, please contact: Loss Glazier, glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu
or Charles Bernstein (bernstei@bway.net) regarding this initiative.

Yeah the J.Clark book is impressive. I enjoy all the risk taking that is there,
the reconstructive work with the narrative in the delightful little prose
vignettes like "on the iron cot," "Napoleonette," invaginations," and "if i
don't return."

This is the third or fourth time I've seen the "the little door..." and weird
mentioned together in this venue. Doesn't the "weird" gets a bad rap with all
the baggage that the word carries (likely the abuse, overuse it gets in pop
culture(weird as "hip"))? Tom Beckett's take on surrealism years back in an
interview was that it had become associated with hip weirdness in America, or
something like that. Ray DiPalma preferred to say "dark music" here.

Jeff Clark is already fairly well connected (published in APR and what not) for
a relatively young age, a good start.

As an addendum to Peter Balestieri's original post (part of which is
excerpted below) that began the interesting thread earlier this morning
on Alan Sondheim's work, I just wanted to say that I, too, purchased
Rochelle Owens' "New and Selected Poems" from Mark Weiss and Junction
Press last week, and find it a handsome volume, a pleasure to hold and
read -- because I didn't really know Owens' work before this, I'm taking
my time looking around and through it -- my initial impression is that
she's a really accomplished writer, able to manage a wide variety of
moods, voices, and rants -- unlike Peter (apparently), I never thought
"wildness" per se was a criteria for poetic excellence -- but I
certainly wouldn't call this work "tame" -- and what he means by "an
older definition of avant-garde work, one that is increasingly codified
and canonized" is truly a mystery. Perhaps, Peter, you could point to
specific examples of Owens that you find fit these descriptions? I'd be
happy to throw in my faves as well . . . it might be worth talking about
. . .

one more word regarding alan sondheim's
remarkable work, in all sorts of characters
and personas...for those interested in being
in contact with alan's updated writings from
jennifer, julu, nikuko, alan -- the fiction-
on-philosophy mailing list is a good place
to read it as it is being created...

other writers interested in a forum
to create texts in a supportive environment
can also post their material there...

information on the list can be found in
the usual places -- search engines,
by searching for under literary or philo-
sophical categories of mailing lists...
or by backchanneling me...

That proved all well, good and pragmatic, when it came to a three
dimensional or four dimensional world. Then, when we exceeded that
the mathematician scratched his head and yelled: "infinity, infinity,
it is all at infinity". Then attempting to plot it beyond four
dimensions, the mathematician, went absolutely mad. There was no way
to plot anything graphically in five true dimensions. The Einsteinian
universe, of four dimensions have been perplexing enough, but how to
plot this new plethora of infinities ?  Impossible. So impossible that
most mathematicians decided that there could be only four and a fifth
was too much for their calculations to contemplate. That mythematical
wall then would stand in the way of a new cosmology where the answer
to the shouts of infinity was always the fact that what had disappeared
on this side was precisely locatable if one more true dimension were
to be added to Einstein's hapless four to make five true dimensions.

Of course, exactly the problem. Vision is the primary empirical sense,
followed by touch and then by sound. These "sense" only four dimensions.
They can empirically discern for the derivations of Einstein's four but
they go no further. Beyond that we have an "unseen world" that traditional
empiricism denies any validity to. So the hard line empricist sides with
the mythematician and they both yell: "infinity, infinity, infinity" as
if that might exorcise the problem.

for such a long time. At least it stood in the way of any reasonably
inclusive cosmology, and multiplied not only infinities but the numbers
of "infinities" into vast legions as massed as the demons of Hades itself.

To say five dimensions was to become transcendental. Horror of horrors.
We cannot see it. We cannot draw it on a graph, without horrendous difficulties.
We can hardly refer to it properly with metaphors and so it is more poetic
than mythematical. Where the mythematician says "infinity, infinity, infinity"
the poet-cosmologist might still be able to delineate something more definite
about how things are. However, the mythematician might never agree, preferring
"infinity" to stand firm. Instead that firmness becomes the monument at the
end of the traditional empiricist's road, where five replaces four.

No more mythos of four dominating everything. No more the four quarters of
empiricism and the quadrants of the graphical representation. Tradition
finally broken down where four is no longer enough, but we must posit five.

How very true, but how very false a premise to give mythematics such
pre-eminence over philosophical cosmology, as if the mythematician's
exhortations of "infinity, infinity, infinity" are the be all and end
of the entire matter.

"The phrase "distinguishable object" has figured in the foregoing.
Counting can be only of the discrete. We cannot count the drops in a
beaker of alcohol unless we first introduce a convention as to what will
be regarded as "a drop." This agreed, we must then find a way of
separating out these drops from one another in an invariant and uniform
way.
Moreover, objects are distinguishable because we distinguish them. The
world is not all cut up for us in advance, just waiting to be numbered;
processes and events are not marked with dotted lines for ease in
numerical tabulation. Counting is seldom undertaken just for its own
sake, or for verbal exercise. We count when we can make significant
connections between the discernible entities we are counting. We
enumerate, not anything and everything, but only that which our
questions, hyptheses, and theories earmark as relevant.
Counting, therefore, helps make our ideas precise-our ideas not only
about the quantitative nature of things but also about the nature of
counting itself. We come to know, implicitly at least, what can and what
cannot be counted. This knowledge gets built into our questions about
nature, so to speak...."---from Perception and Discovery: An

Assuming that the quantum poetry of this universe results in a finite
number of objects being possible, is a more logical assumption. There
are a limited number of components, for which conditions allow a limited
number of different, "useful" or "functional", arrangements. Our universe
as a whole is a poetic form essentially written in one language.

However, I propose that there are other universes, different from the
one that we live in. They might be comprised of very different quantum
units. There is no reason to imagine that every instance of an existent
and functional universe is comprised of the same building blocks of
matter arranged in essentially the same ways as they are _here_. They
would be a different poetic form, written in another language.

Could different universes intercombine along boundaries and produce
even more different combinations, emergent from those boundaries ?
Why not. I think it is possible. Could hybrid poetic forms with
hybrid languages result from that ?  Of course they might.

Imagine a larger vision of the whole, not limited to our narrowly
anthropocentric Terran view. Imagine the analogy of set theory in
mathematics and how that is diagrammed on a piece of paper. Each
set is shown to be a demarcated area, indicating its boundaries.
They overlap where they have elements shared in common. One set can
also be wholly within another set. Where the analogy breaks down
is the constant dynamism of the whole. The boundaries are dynamic
rather than static. The universes effect one another. Their expansions
and contractions. Their pressures upon one another. Their mergings
and emergences are all inter-related. How matter is forced out of
four dimensional existence and into four dimensional existence. How
it disappears into mathematical infinity and emerges from mathematical
infinity is then related to the densities of presence, and the forces
exerted by the dynamisms present, within a five dimensional cosmological
system that remains essentially constant for the whole of cosmogenesis.

Now that is pure poetry. Not simply one form, in one language, but
a unifying paradigm of absolutely universalized poetics.

>"impersonation of the machine that it produces itself so that ultimately
>the machine can replace it."

Of course the ultimate goal is machines that can utilize the fundamental
building blocks, the quanta, of any possible universe, to create any
potentially possible, currently real or in any manner imaginable, thing,
including those with sentience.

That would be an ultimate creativity. An ultimate poetics where the
very stuff that everything that exists is comprised of is the alphabet
and that alphabet is combined into any language, and given any possible form
of expression. Might we then think of every possible thing that might
be made as something written, and thus something purely poetic ?

Is their first album the one I have? I dunno. It's BILLY THE KID
selected and performed by Kat Onoma
The cd # appears to be 592 042 WM332 but it's hard to read. Copyright FNAC

The album cover has CONTACT 78 2740 31 printed on it, which looks like a

I forget who the American agent is promoting it -- he's in LA and sent me
thre album aboiut two or three years ago. I got it some exposure on  the
Vancouver Co-op Radio, but nothing cam e of it that i know of.

The album includes kuch of Spicer's poem, with tyranslated texts ad songs
also by Thomas Lago, from his
Serie B, After Spicer (there's an acute accent on the first e of serie). The
album also includes "Navajo words from THE NIGHT CHAMNT, translated by Jery

Actually n-dimensional geometry is well developed; it presupposes that n
can go to infinity. Measure polytopes such as line segments, squares,
cubes, hypercubes, etc. are governed by very specific laws. Coxeter has
invested these, and there is an excellent book published by Dover on
the subject - D.M.Y. Sommerville, An Introduction to the Geometry of N
Dimensions.

When I was younger I worked out the laws myself for some of the polytopes
- it's not difficult. But the proof that there are only a finite number
for any dimension > than 2 is.

Here's a quote:

"For space of higher dimensions these series persis and are the only ones
possible. Recapitulating, in a plane there are an unlimited number of
regular polygons and 3 regular networks, in space of three dimensions,
there are 5 regular polyhedra and one regular honeycomb, in S-sub-4 there
are 6 regular polytopes and three regular honeycombs, in space of more
than four dimensions there are just 3 regular polytopes and one regular
honeycomb."

A great deal of the book is taken up with intersections of n and m dim-
ensional spaces.

Finally, there are books on Dimension Theory (the title of one published
by Princeton years ago) that go into the foundations of "dimension" - and
it should be noted that string theory works with eleven dimensions, not
four, at least from what I've read.

Weird is a weird word.  It can mean so many things, but in Clark's way I mean
not "hip" at all, interesting, strange ways of laying out the lines, images
which on a surface level (i.e a guy leaning out of a window while you walk
past.)
are normal situations
but Clark takes you somewhere    and I find that weird, in a world of young
poets who want to be "hipsters" and metaphor stirrers,

Clark takes you with him into the realm of this moving image you are allowed
to see, to be in,  without being part of some comparison or metaphor trickery

great discussion for now I will go to it like a "callboy to a c-note"

Any other thoughts on Duncan    ???

yes weird is a bit diffuse, but the disconcerting, unheimlich quality *is*
diffused, saturated throughout the work (not unlike alan's, tho with
obvious differences) and thus makes it hard to pinpoint.  other qualities
aside, i keep coming back to the language: exotic, archaic, foreign:
"daim-coqs" (deer-roosters?), as in
                Howling daim-coqs fill the rows
                Herons from wires love hooves in hose
(wouldn't even eliot have loved that couplet?)  or "gauche mare" (left
pond/pool ... de sang? = cauchemar?). or
                Who deals in scales and fleshrecord players
                Who wafts in the imbroglio of scents
                Whose siblings are spilled in tusky drawers
                Whose oil fouls the linens whose down and lint
                                        ("Mal de Dusk")
i think of "decadence" as a useful descriptor here, more than a hint of an
earlier vintage but decanted through a high-surrealist cheesecloth, made
more potent for the current fin-de-siecle.

(sorry for the bad metaphor; this is supposed to be a compliment.)

years of the twentieth century to the 1990s. =20
        Delville reassesses the work of established prose poets in relation to the
history of modern poetry and introduces writing by some whose work in the
form has so far escaped mainstream critical attention (Anderson, Patchen,
Edson).  He describes the genre=92s European origins and the work of several
early representatives of a modern tradition of the prose lyric (Charles
Baudelaire, Max Jacob, Franz Kafka, and James Joyce). =20

    By applying a broad range of theory to the history of the prose poem,
Delville adds evidence to its reputation as a norm-breaking form writing
within, against and across already existing genres and traditions.  He
shows that the history of the contemporary prose poem is, in many respects,
the record of its efforts to question both the nature of the "poetic" or
"lyric" mode and the aesthetic and ideological foundations of a variety of
other genres and sub-genres, including the fable, the parable, the interior
monologue, the aphorism, the object poem, critical theory, narrative
fiction, autobiography and letter writing, or even the non-literary
tradition of the stand-up comic."

form has so far escaped mainstream critical attention (Anderson, Patchen,
Edson).  He describes the genre=92s European origins and the work of several
early representatives of a modern tradition of the prose lyric (Charles
Baudelaire, Max Jacob, Franz Kafka, and James Joyce). =20

    By applying a broad range of theory to the history of the prose poem,
Delville adds evidence to its reputation as a norm-breaking form writing
within, against and across already existing genres and traditions.  He
shows that the history of the contemporary prose poem is, in many respects,
the record of its efforts to question both the nature of the "poetic" or
"lyric" mode and the aesthetic and ideological foundations of a variety of
other genres and sub-genres, including the fable, the parable, the interior
monologue, the aphorism, the object poem, critical theory, narrative
fiction, autobiography and letter writing, or even the non-literary
tradition of the stand-up comic."

Mime-Version: 1.0

As I recall, from a little research done years ago, this word comes to us
from A-S, where it carried some of the weight/freight of "Fate." Perhaps of
the mystery of eventuation, like "Vhat am I doink in Vauderville," as a
friend from Poland said to me when he was teaching in Maine. (Well, he's
really from Brooklyn, but he had had a Fulbright to Poland [where he no
doubt exclaimed "What am I doing in Lodz."]) And the mystery of
synchronicity. And the terror of memory -- where's the horse gone, where
the bright armor, where the great mead-hall kind of sense to it. One link
with today's word appears to be _surprise_ , happily so or far otherwise.
And, something inexplicable. Witchcraft enters the word somewhere along the
way. So we have its application to amazing moves in a game, the poetry game
e.g.  Weird.   db3

OED is lovely on "weird," as you might expect.  A few samplings to pick
up the weird-licht from Bromwright's armor & mead-hall post:

1603 Philotus c, Quhat wickit weird hes wrocht our wo?

1895 W. Morris Beowulf 16 Weird wends as she willeth.

Ibid. 17 Weird swept them away.

weird.

1678 Ray Prov. (ed. 2) 360 (Sc. Prov.) A man may wooe where he will, but
he will wed where he is weard [ed. 1, where his hap is].

1571 Sir J. Maitland in Satir. Poems Reform. xxvii. 102 Then warreitt

[Quick detour into "wanhap" : misfortune, and the even more devastating
wanhappy : "The wildbair that wanhappie beist"]

1721 J. Kelly Sc. Prov. 2 After Word comes Weird; fair fall them that
call me Madam.

1883 Hall Caine Shadow Crime xxxvi, Weel, weel; after word comes weird.
That’s why the constables are gone, and that’s why Robbie’s come.

David, Yeah, I know what you mean. I decided I wasn't about to duke it out
behind no barn where I was limited to five swings & the other guy
unlimited! I've been thinking of a buddy-system (is that non-gender
specific--it's meant to be) where each talker is matched with a lurker, to
pool his/her message units by forwarding. That way, when there's a genuine
discussion, e.g. Nada Gordon/Alan Sondheim, it could play out in real time.
Joel's " put it all in one message" is great for soapboxing, but lousy for
dialogue, which goes faster than 5 in 24. Sylvester

The case of Sondheim's orientalist heteronyms vs. the case of Akiri
Yasusada.  It's interesting that no one has vented the kind of outrage we
saw on the List a couple of months ago when Yasusada's book
Double-Flowering was announced.  (It's a Roof book, BTW, and both
brilliant and important:  should be seen.)  Different kinds of
"transgression"?  Some fascinating questions arise about what kinds of
transgression are easy to accept and esteem, currently, and which
not....Many points of comparison/contrast come to mind--but the careful
respect Alan Sondheim has gotten, even from scolders, and the earfuls
that Kent was treat to, is.....fascinating.

dialog happens more than 5 in 24. I only work here (volunteer). The five
limit rule was instituted after the peer-pressure method didn't work.
More soapboxing, less dialog, Puhleeeze!

And Sylvester, who said that I would get more than five? Frankly, I
can't imagine needing that many...

Subject:      Repetition
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I am working on a critical study of the use of repetition in 20th C writing
and performance and would appreciate citations people might be able to
provide for works (creative and critical) that deal with NON-LITERARY forms
of repetition: i.e. in music, computer programming, painting, oral
performance, physics, chaos theory, mathematics, mechanics and other areas.
If anyone has come across interesting attempts to account for the peculiar
exigency of repetition without recourse to literary schemes and tropes
please backchannel me the info.

I'm trying to make a case for a certain use of repetition that defies the
inherently symmetrical/stabilizing/structuring forms of repetition that
anchor western systematics. Repetition as process rather than structure.
Key figures/areas are (of course) Stein, as well as Pound, Hejinian,
Scalapino, bpNichol, visual/sound/oral poetries.

With thanks in advance!

NEW FROM MEOW PRESS:

Graham Foust, 3 from Scissors
Andrew Levy, Elephant Surveillance To Thought
Denise Newman, Of Later Things Yet to Happen

Currently I am in the process of getting caught up with Meow Press
activities, such as reading manuscripts and answering long over due mail,
making books, making books and making more books.

In the next few weeks, Meow Press will produce its 50th book. All of the
backlist items are currently available. By the end of the week, SPD will
have copies of Aaron Shurin's limited edition Codex & I am in the process
of assembling Dodie Bellamy's Hallucinations and Kevin Killian's Argento
Series, which SPD now has in stock.

(Some) books from the forthcoming list:

Susan Schultz, Addenda
Ted Pearson, The Devil's Aria
Noemie Maxwell, Thrum
David Carl, The Library
Liz Waldner, Bus Stop
Adrian Clarke, Just Deserts
Paul Long, Saccades
Don Cheney, Catullus


and more. Please write privately to inquire about ordering books or
sponsoring a book from the forthcoming list.

I am committed to making 50 books a day for 90 straight days. I have help
in the assembly dept but am going to need to replace my toner about 8
times in the course of these 4,500 books (78,000 prints). The recent
donation of an old Apple laserwriter makes this a little cheaper. If you
can help, please do.

This isn't the non-literary, Scott, but one area in which a lot of work has
been done on an "oral poetry" which makes much use of repetition is with
the various traditions of Yaqui songs. I don't know if you would find this
"repetition as process rather than structure," but there is at least one
way in which I think it is that. You should look at Yaqui Deer Songs, ed.
by Larry Evers and Felipe S. Molina, pub. by the U of Arizona Press
sometime in the early or mid-1980's, and also Wo'i Bwikam/Coyote Songs, ed.
by Evers and Molina, pub. by Chax Press. The book of the deer songs is more
of a critical work with a lot of cultural/social and literary context; the
Coyote Songs book has a useful introduction, even though its critical
apparatus is very minimal.

If I understand correctly what you're asking, there are a number of mathematical operations that one might consider both examples of repetition -- iteration -- and somehow "nonsystematic". This is, in a sense, what chaos theory is all about (for the mathematician), and catastrophe theory (for the engineer). Then there are also clever linguistic/mathematical crossovers that involve repetition across the boundary; the sequence {1,11,21,1112,3112,211213...}, for example.

More generally, repetition is one part of a binary, its antithetical pair being subdivision. In Western music, rhythym is built from subdivision, and it is more of a strucutral device -- the production of a grid from which to hang various units -- than something that is consciously realized in performance. Many non-Western musical traditions (including the subcontinent) construct rhythymic units through repetition -- a concatentation of various sound lengths with no notion of how a particular note, as played, might be subdivided in terms of its neighbours.

I believe Small Press Dist. carries RADI OS.  Part of ARK, the
last section, called "Ramparts", was first published in
Conjunctions 15 (94?), and includes a brief statement on poetics
by RJ. As for the  earlier books, I think they're all out of
print.  Steve McCaffery has written a great essay on Johnson, the
name of which escapes me -- check the MLA.

Yours,

Interesting to me that once "weird"  (fate) was primarily a noun, a
force--now it is usually an adjective indicating a category that causes
discomfort--almost proto fascist in that application. One vote or node
here for "wyrdness" versus "wiredness."

And check the etymology of "wired" ... for fun (related to hair and
manly as well as "virgin").

Just a tad-bit of semi-useless information concerning the new poetry
reading series, Apokatastasis Reading Series (Thanks, Ginny Masullo, for
the name) in Providence, Rhode Island.

The reading takes place at Myopic Books on South Angell Street in
Providence, and starts at 8:00p.m.

Tonight's featured reader is Bill MacMillan of Worcester, MA.
In coming weeks we will be featuring Kyria Abrahams, Tony Brown, Michael
Brown, and others.  (Hopefully Cathleen Calbert, if i can get her e-mail
address).

Anyone who is/will be in the area and would like directions to the reading
or would like to discuss the possibility of a featured reading (it pays $30
for a 35-45 min. reading), feel free to  e-mail me at Brent_Long@brown.edu

This reading was started in order to counter-balance the overrated "Slam"
poetry scene, and to embrace all schools and genres of poetry/short
fiction, so all are welcome.. Also, there is an open reading following the
featured reader every week, and open reading participants are allowed 5
minutes each.  $2 at the door pays the featured reader and includes a
bottomless cup of coffee.  You can also bring your own beverage of choice
(i.e. wine, beer, etc.).

However, this is NOT an open forum to come and read your diary, so please
bring your strongest work.  Hope to see you all there..


Brent

Scott,

For musical examples / analogies, you might look at / listen to:

-- early Steve Reich (I hear the more recent stuff as
symmetrical/stabilizing/structuring, "classicizing," etc., but "Violin Phase"
and "It's Gonna Rain," say, get at a sense of repetition as processual,
diachronic, etc., etc.

-- Anthony Braxton's newer Ghost Trance Musics, and any published accounts of
his compositional method within his former quartet -- which would often play
one composition in the drums and bass, another in the piano, and yet a third
on sax -- deploying the repeatability of these compositions as "unit
structures" (think Cecil Taylor, when you say that, you dirty structuralist)
to effect a complex interlayering which ultimately compromises and
reconfigures their unit status. Anthony Rabano has a good, but technical and
rather difficult book, on Braxton, which deals mostly with the quartet years.

-- dub, esp. Lee Perry, King Tubby, and more recent stuff produced by Adrian
Sherwood (Revolutionary Dub Warriors, Dub Syndicate, et al) -- repetition at
the level of the "version"

-- raga -- good, relatively non-technical chapter on this in Derek Bailey's
book Improvisation -- I'm at a loss for accounts of the music by practicing
and / or historical musicians of the subcontinent (someone help?)

-- (related to repetition): persistence, sustain -- as in long-duration
minimalism -- Tony Conrad, Phill Niblock, early LaMonte Young -- "keeping on"
as opposed to "doing again," with the proviso that such an "opposition" might
be called into question by these musical practices

-- anything on West African "additive rhythm" (sorry, no sources at the
moment)

-- Jacques Attali's Noise treats repetition not only as a micro-component of
the musical object / event, but uses it to name an historical stage in the
macro-social organization of music:
"[With the advent of recording] More than ever, music becomes a monologue. It
becomes a material object of exchange and profit, without having to go through
the long and complex detour of the score and performance anymore. Capitalism
has a frank and abstract interest in it. . . . Once again, music shows the
way: undoubtedly the first system of sign production, it ceases to be a
mirror, an enactment, a direct link, the memory of past sacrifical violence,
becoming a solitary listening, the stockpiling of sociality.
     The mode of power implied by repetition, unlike that of representation,
eludes precise localization; it becomes diluted, masked, anonymous, while at
the same time exacerbating the fiction of the spectacle as a mode of
government" (88).
This might be a less savory sense of the repetition-as-process you're looking
at: repetition is that which "eludes precise localization" -- i.e., that which
is destabilizing in any particular event-series -- only insofar as it
reproduces at the largest scale the contours of a spectacular ideology. In
many ways, this reads like a rehearsal of Jameson's by-now-infamous critique
of Perelman's "China."

-- (related to repetition): This, from Iannis Xenakis' "Formalized Music":
"But the profound lesson of such a table of coherences is that any theory or
solution given on one level can be assigned to the solution of problems on
another level. Thus the solutions in macrocomposition . . . can engender
simpler and more powerful new perspectives in the shaping of microsounds than
the usual . . . functions can" (vii). Thus, a kind of repetition across levels
of scale in either or several directions -- repetition here is not the
incremental addition of units to form a whole, but the process by which one
whole might be said to model another. (In another realm entirely, see Samuel
Delany's various texts and paratexts on the "modular calculus" [Trouble on
Triton and its second appendix, the appendix to Tales of Neveryon, all of
Neveryona, and "The Tale of Plagues and Carnivals" in Flight from Neveryon]
for an indication of some of the difficulties of generating such a modeling
procedure which does not lapse into easy analogizing). Xenakis, of course, has
also worked as an architect, so I wouldn't be surprised to find other works by
him which deal with this problematic in terms of architecture.

. . . and one example from architecture / visual art:

-- Arakawa and Gins, any of the various catalogues or publications stemming
from their 1997 Guggenheim show -- when you build a structure out of , say, a
regular dodecahedron with one missing face repeated in a linear series in
which each iteration is rotated a certain number of degrees off the horizontal
and the vertical, you've established a very different relation between unit
and macro-form than that of a Corbusier, all the evident similarities (i.e.,
reduction of the large to a series of repeated smalls) notwithstanding.

Hope this helps. See you in Buffalo soon.

such a modeling procedure which does not lapse into easy analogizing).
Xenakis, of course, has also worked as an architect, so I wouldn't be surprised
to find other works by him which deal with this problematic in terms of
architecture.

<P>. . . and one example from architecture / visual art:

<P>-- Arakawa and Gins, any of the various catalogues or publications stemming
from their 1997 Guggenheim show -- when you build a structure out of ,
say, a regular dodecahedron with one missing face repeated in a linear
series in which each iteration is rotated a certain number of degrees off
the horizontal and the vertical, you've established a very different relation
between unit and macro-form than that of a Corbusier, all the evident similarities
(i.e., reduction of the large to a series of repeated smalls) notwithstanding.

<P>Hope this helps. See you in Buffalo soon.

Decadence is apt descriptor in his book yes. The prose continues to haunts me
most, what Baudelaire could be now, but the racy, fictive narrative agrees too!

High-surrealism: are we there yet? Has Jeff Clark raised the bar? What do
listcitizens think of (if anything) the later noir films of David
Lynch/surrealism as this relates to recent threads on "flatness," 'specially
with regard to flattened female figuretypes?

There does seem to be mounting evidence of commercial pop-culture gesturing in
the direction of this fin-de-siecle, a jockeying in position for the final
stretch. There has been a burst of stage and cinematic activity on the life of
Oscar Wilde which I find interesting. Found the film "Wilde" to be surprising,
likable, but a bit tamed, or perhaps normalized. Still, should be an eye-opener
for anyone thus uninitiated.

Huge oooops......you've made a common error. The clue there is "geometry".
I was referring to true dimensions. Seems Einstein _believed_ that there are
only four such dimensions. (Always best to use as few as possible.) Four
dimensional space-time was to be  believed to be sufficient to fully locate
any event. Fact is that there are too many, empiracally observable,
anomalies for that to be true. (Not to mention the non observable ones that
elude us simply because we lack the means as to that observation.) So the
Einsteinian cult, and its religion, follows the Newtonian cult and its
religion. If we suspend the element of belief we realize that is not where
it ends.....progress always rears its ugly many heads and shatters the
belief. That is a paradigm shift. We are currently in the middle of the
biggest paradigm shift that has ever happened in science....the leap beyond
Einstein and beyond the limits of past empiricisms.

Nevertheless the geometer tries to confound as, joining in to obfuscate the
meaning of dimension, along with the mythematician who is yelling "infinity,
infinity, infinity".... It really is surreal.

Wierd as it seems, the history of science claims that before Einstein's
poetry there were only three dimensions. That is in Newton's poetry. That is
a different usage of the word "dimension". Shows you how the mythematicians
got so fuddled up that they had to redefine the terms dimension and
dimensionality to obfuscate the real difficulties.

The difficulty as to defining the poetic usage of words, precisely, and
distinguishing mythematical infinity (any empirically non locatable event,
any incommensurable even if very finite) from true infinity, and
distinguishing the mythematical geometers multiplicity of geometric
dimensions from true dimensions.

All that geometry stuff is known in what amount to three, occassionally
if you are doing animations, four, dimensional graphics. Geometers rarely
even think about Einstein. They simply define any possible geometric shapes,
within their own system of definitions. Geometry as another poetics.

Again, those geometric dimensions are not true dimensions, but we do begin
from Euclidean poetry. (The geometer simply adds verses to that epic.)

True dimensions are the 1-3) 3 Euclidian dimensions of space    x,y,z
                          4) the dimension of time              t
                          5) Let's call this the "hyper-dimension" T
                             (T is appropriate as it locates tachyons
                              but to locate tachyons requires the three
                              Euclidean coordinates plus a T coordinate.)

       Some would add     6) Many Worlds (really permutations of the above
                             but including bifurcations of causal chains in
                             terms of quantum event histories).

                          7) probabilities

Some do include #7, but it is the only one that is disputable as being
a true dimension. However, because causality becomes so "synchronistically"
complicated by the fact of five true dimensions, potentially resulting in a
highly complex interweaving of bifurcating chains of cause-effect quantum
histories, we must include a sixth dimension to allow localization of whole
sets of such cause-effect quantum histories from their bifurcation point.
That means, any branchings of quantum histories, as found anywhere along the
t or T axis of coordinates.

Although I can "picture" it, roughly, in my mind, I cannot suggest an
adequate "geometric" representation. Rough analogies or geometric metaphors,
sure, but no definite way to represent this six dimensionality. Essentially
shove an empirically "invisible" space-time into the four dimensional
visible one so that the two are interactive. Ouch. That boggles the brain
and the computer. Add probabilities of any interaction, in all of that, and
you're there in the universal madhouse.

Remember that a true dimension is never reducable to anything else. It is
necessary so as to be able to locate quantum events in space-time.

>Finally, there are books on Dimension Theory (the title of one published
>by Princeton years ago) that go into the foundations of "dimension" - and

Again, not true dimensions, and string theory has been discussed in terms
of more than eleven geometric dimensions, but that might be the lowest
possible number of geometric dimensions that were necessary to produce the
original string theory metaphor.

        Tom, I think moral climates have altered as much as literal
climates since 1898. It's difficult to imagine a famous playwright being
jailed for 2 years for homosexual acts, today. Surely we're in the El Nino
of moral climates with Clinton in the W.H. & Maplethorpe in the galleries.
Sure, Jesse Helms and ilk still have clout, but in California and Ontario
those attitudes feel remote.

Oscar, however, keeps his currency. One year back in the '80s I decided to
try "The Importance" out on an Intro to World Lit class. It was a stretch,
I figured, but what th'heck. They loved it! And every year thereafter, the
next set of "them" did, too. Surely these young english twits of '98 had
nothing to show my northern california dudes and dudettes of '89. It was
the wit, the wit survived--that, and maybe the airy disdain for convention,
curiously twinned as it is, there, with the worry as to what is the proper
thing.

  I have yet to see the movie--which a friend whose opinions I sometimes
trust (when they have agreed with my own) recommends. Any List-eners have
an opinion?

Ps : Tom, as you, being up there near the weekend-getaway moose-lodge know,
we owe to George Bowering a great deal for this freeing up of at least
Canada's moral climate. It wasnt so long ago that Maria Damon and Rachel
Loden were testifying to his pioneeer work. Surely the silence of late on
this score announces the triumph of the new morality, rather than its
having succumbed to an older set of regulations?  D

I heard he was crook. At least, the photo I have of him waving

In the future they can see clearly with the lights all turned off.
Or, prognostications for a future cyber symbiotic capability.

On the not so future battlefield it is possible that the same facilitation
that facilitates remote viewing will enable troops to, in essence, see enemy
positions. The data from satellites that are capable, for example, of
sensing a single circuit within a tiny electronic device at vast distances,
combined with data from infra-red and electromagnetic sensing stations,
merged meaningfully into the human visual impression of what is directly
emergent in the field of view.

We might easily envision a futuristic capability of remote and meaningful
electromagnetic sensing of an organic system's information processing by an
inorganic entity, transmitted virtually to a central processor, translated
into machine data, interpreted by a multitude of expert systems,
retranslated back into electromagnetic data that conforms to the organic
systems processing language, and transmitted over a long distance to another
organic system. The organic source becoming an organic sensing peripheral to
the central processor, and the organic receiver receiving the informational
content of the entire process as a kind of "remote viewer", on a need to
know basis, any useless data and erroneous data having been presumably
filtered out. All happening virtually in what is effectively zero elapsed time.

Incredible, even unbelievable, as that technological supremacy seems to be,
I believe that it is entirely feasible, and that organic devices can be
fully merged with inorganic systems, in a fully symbiotic, meaningful and
pragmatically useful manner. Not only that, but that they can function at
potentially mythematically "infinite" distances. A fighting force that
possesses such intelligence cannot be defeated where the outcome is
significantly dependent on intelligence, as opposed to being dependent
purely upon other assets.

We might also envision that any hostile fighting force, arriving at this
planet, from beyond our solar system, will already have that kind of
technological advantage and will be fully psionic and symbiotic. That any
alien force would be competitively hostile rather than friendly, within a
remarkably competitive and hostile Nature, is indicated by our empirical
observations of human and other species, species internal and species
external, interactions. So, if the real
demons or angels decide or chance to arrive here, at this clod of earth, at
the far reaches of the galaxy, we are in real deep doo-doo.

All of that brought only one thought to mind.

All ideas are in fact quantum electromagnetic events. They are in essence
materialized in the same manner as is other stuff (matter). Ideas are in
effect no different from other things. They are substantia. They are actua,
rather than potentia. There is no potentia. There is no Platonic form. Even
the thought of any potentia is in fact a kind of actua. The same as to
Plato's ideas regarding the world of ideal forms. Whatever we can perceive
and/or cognize is in effect, as that very process, and that instance of
manifestation of process, right to its most fundamental roots, a quantum
complex of material events.

Insubstantial is nothing. Insubtantial does not exist. Immaterial does not
exist. What does not exist cannot be thought except as this thought of not
being and that thought of not being is itself already beingness as a thought
of not being. There we stop. We can go no further. We can no longer divide
the world into body and soul, mind and matter, in the ways that our
ancestors did.
Now there is only one world of quantum histories, quantum cause-effect
chains, material events.

There is no mind and body duality. There are only quantum events. That
expression shakes all previous worldviews, and divides us from tradition.

There are also only the histories of quantum events. Can we be so poetic as
to refer to that a the "soul" ?  It would be no more than poetic license to
do so.
(As long as our poetic licenses are not revoked I suppose that is alright.)

The interesting question is the virtual storage of _all_ of those quantum
histories. It quickly exceeds the old byte per neuron capabilities of an
entire brain, in any organic system. It exceeds, by many times more, the
byte per neuron capacity of any specialized storage area envisioned by
traditional neurology as being devoted to memory.

So we arrive at a quanta of memory, parallel to the quantum metaphor for
the structure of matter.

Imagine the precise resolution required for any discernment of one idea
from among all the possible data within a typical jumble of lifetime
acquisition within any typical "free agent" organic system.

The typical demonstrations of nanotechnology become a child's toy in comparison
to the scanning and retrieval capabilities of a highly evolved intelligence
system (whether organic or inorganic).

This reminds us of David Cronenberg's movie "Scanners" and what a leap of
technological speculation, considering the currency of the setting wherein
the story takes place, is represented in that particular depiction.
Cronenberg claims immediacy. Does that frighten us ?  Perhaps that is the
thought that viewers of the film failed to think. What if that is us, today,
right now,
was unthinkable to them. It was too terrifying to contemplate. Similar to
the momentary amnesia that the victims of most serious accidents experience,
at the moment of impact and very often for a short while after that, the
viewers of the film could not think that thought superimposed upon their own
day to day realities. However, in the future, we might easily predict that
that is part of the day to day reality of everyperson.

Just a quick note re a new book.  I think it might be of interest to
university libraries which have an Irish section.  If anyone would like to
see a brochure which contains reproductions of the lino-printing, the
author can be contacted at

****************************************
The State We're Out is a novel without words told ijn a series of fifty
three original printed plates by Brendon Deacy.  The narrative describes
one man's emigration from the West of Ireland in 1951 and his subsequent
experiences but as Roddy Doyle writes in his foreword, 'its form invites us
all to create our own story from the images and, perhaps more importantaly,
the page-turns between the images.'  The pictures have been created by
linocut printing, a medium which powerfully and directly evokes all the
vitality of the wide range of events and emotions resulting from exile.

Subject:      recommended criticism

Would like to recommend remarkable book out of Canada:
INFINITY, FAITH & TIME by John Spencer Hill
McGill-Queen's Univ Press
isbn 0773516611

Book explores renaissance humanist tradition of faith-grounded reason out
of Clement of Alexandria & Nicholas de Cusa, contrasting it with
scientific rationalism which followed it.  Looks at concepts of time,
space, infinity via Traherne, Milton, Shakespeare, Pascal; Augustine &
Bergson.

We have had many discussions on the list circling around issues of
science & poetry; this book gets at the roots of those dealing with
reason/faith/knowledge & points toward a contemporary reconnection
with the questions confronting Donne, Herbert, Shakespeare, Milton,
Traherne - the basic role of poetry in a rationalized cosmos.  Implying
also a re-renaissance of this connection in poetry itself.

The section on Nicholas of Cusa alone is worth checking this one out.
An amazing thinker who undid the scholastic/Aristotelian closed cosmos
decades (centuries?) before Copernicus (much more timidly) did, without
either mystical eccentricity or rationalist enthusiasm (ie. F. Bacon).
See Nick's volume: ON LEARNED IGNORANCE.  For example, Nicholas
thought the question of whether the universe is finite or infinite
was moot.  This sounds like a typical medieval know-nothingism, but
it's not; Nick had a very subtle concept of creation as
BOTH finite & infinite.  Red shift, anybody?

From the most recent New York Review of Books:

To satisfy the religious right, many textbooks have largely banished the
 words "imagine" and "feel." According to an editor at McGraw-Hill,
 who did not want to be identified, "We were told to try to avoid using
 the word 'imagine' because the people in Texas felt it was too close to
 the word 'magic' and therefore might be considered anti-Christian.
 Instead of saying 'Imagine you were sailing across the Atlantic with
 Christopher Columbus,' we were encouraged to write 'Suppose you
 were...'"

Sounds doubtful, because the subject necessarily is so multi-disciplinary
and a specialist in one area is hardly able to see the big picture. At least
most cannot. Your implication that the book (which I have not read) is
mostly about chemicals in the environment is indicative of that same criticism.

Cancer is a very complicated disease. Actually there is no such disease, as
it is a category for a very wide variety of disorders with very divergent
etiologies. In fact, any example, of one identifiable (scientifically
namable) disorder might have many different etiologies. The causality of the
disorder need not be the same in each instance. Often it is not the same.

I can phrase this as a question about the book. Does the book discuss

1). genetic precursors (predispositions to specific disorders)
2). physiological precursors (contributing or causal to the etiology of
    specific disorders)
3). psychological precursors (contributing or causal....)
4). in light of 2) and 3) does it discuss sociological and economic factors
    that can predispose some individuals towards specific disorders
5). does it discuss how 1), 2), 3), and 4), are related to other environmental
    agents that are definitely identifiable as causal factors in specific
    disorders ?  That does not mean simply to say that such specific
    environmental agents are simply _present_ in the environment where there
    is an increased prevalence of a specific disorder, but it means empirical
    and indisputable proof that a specific suspected chemical or other
    environmental agent is in fact causal to a specific disorder or disorders.
    In other words is it based on hard science or only impassioned belief
    and a lot of misinformation that comes from non scientific discourse
    and second hand misinterpretation of hard science ?  Most books that
    popularly appear in the non fiction section are of the latter kind.
    They have little or no value other than entertainment of the masses.

6). are the newer areas of electromagnetics and bioenergetics even mentionned
    in their role, which is both positive and negative, depending on the
    a multitude of internal and external factors.

7). is the role of the immune system and what has effects upon it mentionned
    in relation to predisposition to specific disorders, including where
    environmental agents are suspected as being significantly causal ?

8). are chemicals as such differentiated into mutagens and carcinogens
    and are they discussed, in hard science, terms as to their suspected or
    definitely proven role, as causal or catalyst to or with other causalities,
    in the etiology of specific disorders ?

If the book does some of that and does it accurately it is worth reading.

Otherwise I shall stick to poetry and leave "Living Downstream" in the
fiction department.

i'm encountering this sort of thing in my collaboration with a writer of
educational materials, in this project on teaching poetry to grades 3-5. we
can't even mention the names allen ginsberg or h rap brown, though we are
doing units on list poems and rap.

The article that quote comes from is a review of Joy Hakim's _A History of
US_, the one US history book for children that isn't written by a
committee.  An important article; I read it yesterday and left it feeling
pretty close to sure that literacy and history in this country are doomed.

The list might be interested to know that the "hyberbolic blurbs" on the
back cover of Rochelle Owens' _New and Selected Poems: 1961-1996_ are by
Jerome Rothenberg, Maureen Owen, Jane Augustine and Marjorie Perloff.

Here, for the list's amusement, is John Olson's review, puublished in
Sulfur 42.

Reading Rochelle Owens is like riding a Harley-Davidson: a savage intellect
rumbles in the words like frenzied pistons. _Rochelle Owens/ New and
Selected Poems (1961-1996)_, Junction Press, 1997, (how appropriate that
the photograph on the cover shows her adjusting a high collar on a black
leather coat) is a strange brew. "Indeterminacy of syntax" is a gross
understatement. Beginning with the early work Owens' syntax is aggressively
charged and highly compressed, "honey & dung hidden burnt a form filtering/
through the wall/ soaking through the guiltless lederhosen." The
interrelational density of her words, the supercharged hyperverbalism of
her style is consistent throughout. "O it's going to be/ murder at
Christmastime for me," Owens decalaims in a fragment from 1988's _How Much
Paint Does the Painting Need_, "my blood pressure/ dropped to a dangerous
level/ eyelids of black glass/ wanting to tango." Owens' entire oeuvre is a
tango with the auditor/reader. It is violent and dangerous. Edgy and
bloody. Wild. What amazes me is the entire lack of _melopoeia_, the absence
of musical phrasing. The words are tough, sharp, jagged. Raw and impudent,
dripping blue fire. "bulging/ six Urges!" "...& 8 darknesses/ burn &
chant!" It is not surprising Rochelle Owens is also a playwright and video
artist. There is an aura of spectacle about her poetry, Catherine wheels
and Roman candles fountaining sparks and dragons. Her poems seethe, boil,
thrash and lunge. Were I an actor auditioning for a role as a prophet, I
might want to choose a piece from _Elga's Incantation_ to declaim. "YES GOD
PUT A BODY ON COME ON BACK & RISE WHILE I'M IN THE FLAESH LIKE YOU YES & IT
MUSH BE THAT'S RIGHT MUST BE WRITTIN OF THE LAW MOSES MUST BE FULFILLED
MUZIC & DAVID WAS A O FOOL & SLOW OF HEART & GOD WANTED THINGS DONE & THEY
FELL DOWN & HE ROSE LIKE A PROVERB SO NOBODY PLAYS MUZIC IN AMOS' HOUSE."

two friends - vance bell (university of penn/english) and darren floyd
(temple u./film) organized a series last semester at the writers house
called "interrogating cinema."  one of the seminars was on repetition.  the
films i recall covering (in darren's pre-made 15 minute series of clips)
were:

flirt                           hal hartley
masculin/feminin                jean-luc godard
aeon flux (episode"tide")       MTV Liquid Television
la jetee                        chris marker
last year at marienbad          alain resnais
the cook, the thief, his wife and her lover     peter greenaway
triumph of the will             leni riefenstahl


interesting conversations i remember:

*as in stein saying "i never repeat myself" - repetition more often
reveals difference rather than sameness(actual repetition)

*force - marching bands and "themes" in riefenstahl; seduction/feeling of
no exit in marienbad;  getting accustomed to abuse in the cook, et al.
staying in line, staying in a bad relationship, returning to the bad
host/bad goverenment out of habit. . . watch these films and think of
these ideas.  wow.  good stuff.

*we talked about sonnets and repetition of certain forms partly to situate
oneself in a tradition but also partly to gain entry into a scene.  this
brought up the topis of habit, also empty gestures - mentioned ron
padget's "sonnet" that repeats "nothing in that drawer" 14 times;
repetition in work, class, memory, and character(see flirt).  also the
fact that riefenstahl-style (tall, overwhelming, seductive,
downright irresistable) filmmaking is foundational for present-day
big time hollywood film.  what are we repeating here.

if you can watch only one of these films - last year at marienbad
contains (though *way* more subtlely) *all* the moves.

POETRY CITY is happy to present KESTON SUTHERLAND

this THURSDAY JUNE 4 at 7 PM readers familiar with
Keston's work only from the internet may not know
that he looks like the young JOHN LENNON and he sounds
more like WIRE than the BUZZCOCKS he is the author
of several chapbooks including the recent AT THE MOTEL
PARTIAL OPPORTUNITY and a forthcoming collection from
CHRIS ALEXANDER's nominative press collective  John
Kinsella has had to cancel no one not even the rain
you know I'd say the number of poets whose work I've
come to know mainly through readings is nowhere near
the number of poets whose work I found first in print
but the opportunities for reading here in New York
far outcount the chances to publish so yes I think
I know what some poets have said about readings that
they're harmful ego radiation that the basso continuo
is adore me but I think this is ungenerous and therefore
less likely the case than that they are performances
recitals occasions to present something which is not
the writer to someone who is not the audience  ie
they are only as much about the self speaking as
the self speaking wants them to be  and in New York
one clear effect of the lack of opportunities to
publish the prevalence of  opportunities to read has
been that the poetics have shifted away from a theo-
retical basis  a so-called critique of ideology
we don't have those materials to work with  Brian's
funny Ray Liotta impressions aside  we have had to
tell each other what we heard  photocopies become
sculptural in  manhattan portage bags and chapbooks

The state of California, I'm told by a high school teacher friend, has
under Pete Wilson stopped teaching American history before 1900. Thought
I'd mention this to cheer you up.

hey morpheal, why don't you do us ALL a big favor and read the book... or
at least pick it up and look at it... it's kind of amazing that you're
capable of generating a 5kb post about something you haven't read, in
response to a 3kb post from me with a few evaluative claims regarding
something i *have* read...

ok?... *you* look at the book, and *you* determine whether it answers
*your* questions... it answered/enhanced many of mine... in any case i
maintain that, in my view, it's a remarkable book, even if i voice
hesitation (again) about calling it, or any book, a "must read"---and your
response is one reason why i voice such hesitation...

so i cheerfully withdraw the suggestion that anyone "must read" anything...
but if the latter if taken simply as a superlative descriptor, why then
i'll stick to it...

best, as i am able///

hi all, a russian translator, Maria Zavialova, who sat in on my american
poetry since 1940, and who was involved in samizdat publishing (worked on
Chasy, etc), knows Arkadii Dragomoshenko etc., will be visiting New York
City for two weeks starting the day after tmw (friday).  i've taken the
liberty of giving her some of the e-amil addresses and phone #s of those of
you whose e's and phone #s i knew, so you may be hearing from her.  she
really wants to know what's going on in NYC.  I told her about St. Mark's,
the Nuyorican, and the Teachers and Writers Collab and some other stuff.
But if you hear from her, it's my doing, and i hope some of you anyway will
have time to have a chat or something.  her e-mail address is
zaria001@tc.umn.edu, don't know how much longer that'll be good for, maybe
till end of june?
thanks all --md

        Come, let us adore him/her, the poetry performer! For we must adore
someone, and better her/him than the death scene of a god, or the religious
right, or billary clit, misplaced worship that makes us liable to big
ripoff. But where is it writ or proven that adoration rightly placed is
harmful? I recently attended a concert by Ray Davies, and we adored him for
bringing back the feisty feel of our youth. Performers _do_ _give_
something.

EP wrote that the study of literature is hero worship.

A big line in "As Good As It Gets" is Jack's character saying to Helen
Hunt's, "you make me want to be a better man." It goes over big with her,
and why not? When I hear a moving performance of poetry, it makes me feel
finer, brighter, purged, relaxed and alert, makes me want to keep that
going, what's false about that, why the fear?   David

To catch up on a few points:

-- Those who want to pursue Rochelle Owens' work(s) should also check
out the plays which made her for a time what Ross Wetzteon in The
Village Voice called "the most profound tragic playwright in the
American theater."  (The "hyperbole" here was playing off the profoundly
_comic_ nature of her work.)  The most immediate source I have is a
collection of five plays, _Futs & What Came After_, which Random House
published and for which I was privileged to write the introduction.
It's probably out of print by now but Mark W. would likely have a better
sense of that.  There was also a film version of her first play, Futz,
directed like the stage version by Tom O'Horgan, and her other directors
included Andre Gregory and Lawrence Kornfeld at the old Judson Theater.
Notable later plays were _He Wants Shih_ and _The Karl Marx Play_, with
lots of activity in Germany and elsewhere in Europe throughout the
1970s.

-- For what it's worth (and assuming anyone remembers back to when the
note was sent by David Bromige) the line about "Bombs opening like
flowers" used to be attributed to Mussolini's son (I think the son
rather than the son-in-law) on the occasion of a bombing by Italian
airplanes (circa 1936) of pitifully unarmed Ethiopian troops.  But
maybe, as David suggests, he was quoting D'Annunzio.

-- Peter Quartermain mentions the use in the Kat Onoma Billy the Kid
album of "Navajo words from THE NIGHT CHANT, translated by Jerry
Rothenberg in Technicians of the Sacred" and thinks I might have some
more information about all of that.  Actually I don't think it ever came
to my attention -- but then my attention span is pretty short -- so I'm
as puzzled as the next guy.  I should point out, however, that I didn't
really translate the Night Chant, although I included one of the
poem-songs in Technicians.

-- That poem and many others in Technicians would, I think, be major
examples of the use of repetitions in (so-called) oral poetry.  I
believe that Technicians was full of commentaries on all of that -- in
both their traditional & experimental manifestations.

-- And finally, since I don't think it's been mentioned, Exact Change
has just reprinted my 1974 anthology, _Revolution of the Word: A New
Gathering of American Avant-Garde Poetry 1914-1945_: s facsimile of the
original with a new cover by Marcel Duchamp.  So ...

Best,

Jerome Rothenberg

Hero worship--of course, how could I have been so dense?  That must have
been what George B. had in mind at the Bide-a-Wee in Lake Oswego, all
those springs ago.  George, forgive me!  You can take off the moose
antlers now.

A reminder to sundry consumers that Barque Press has now made available
the sublimely proprioceptive wizardry of J.H. Prynne's _Red D Gypsum_,
which can be sent your way for $7 incl. postage and packing.  Positive
reviews flooding in, including the following (a big claim indeed) from
John Kinsella:  " I reckon it's Jeremy's best work. True rad pastoral."
Some competition.  Anyhow: orders from the US still being taken, within

For those of you who don't know John's work, these words of Marjorie
Perloff's (from the jacket) should help locate him:

"Discussion of John Matthias' important poetic oeuvre  — so wonderfully
various in its conception and execution and so often arcane enough to
demand careful study — is long overdue.  Robert Archambeau, himself a
poet-critic, has assembled a superb group of contributors, including
such leading voices on contemporary poetry as Michael Anania, Romana
Huk, Vincent Sherry and John Peck.  Taken together, the twelve essays in
Word Play Place, prefaced by Archambeau's excellent and informative
introduction, make an important statement about Matthias' place on the
current poetry scene — and indeed, on the scene itself as it is playing
out in England and America.  An extremely valuable book!"


John's work really is remarkable, and this book has been a labor of love
for me.  Hope it helps get John the recognition he deserves.



(*footnote: John Matthias may have the broadest stylistic reach of any
poet in America -- I'm sure this is the only book ever published with
jacket copy by both Marjorie Perloff and Robert Pinsky.)

Same superluminal trend here also.....

Since the future belongs to machines, the machines in remaking humankind
into the image of the machine, would demand that humans give up imagination and
emotional feelings. After all, the artificial intelligence machines do not
have either imagination or emotional feelings, do they ?

Maybe that is a possible answer.

After all, why blame a few rabid right wing narrow minded superstitious Xtians ?

No. They would only be cogs in the machine also, wouldn't they ?

So glad to have brought Rachel Loden out of lurk mode with a recent post. I
have adored her posts since I first logged on to this List. She has become
a model for me--she makes me want to be a better e-male.

Too bad she wasn't around when EP needed a better person to worship than Il
Duce. But up until then, Rachel, wouldnt you say that he made something
good out of his devotions to some writers living and dead ?

Btw, Rachel & others, those arent _moose_ antlers on Bowering. They grow
out of his skull.

O absolutely, yes.  Some of his devotions became my devotions--much to
the fury of my father, a Jew who fought in Patton's army.  He tried to
take Pound off my shelves many years ago (but failed).  I forgave him a
little when I heard snippets of EP's broadcasts : "A hundred yids should
die for every Fascist that falls..."  But no, just couldn't resist the
bit of business you'd so beautifully set up--

Not exactly the answer, but related: Watched Greenaway's "Pillow Book" last night.
Exquisite film. And I thought of the recent list-response to the Nikuko poems.
Greenaway certainly flirts with steroetypes, though not, I think, Asian-female
stereotypes so much as artsy-bohemian stereotypes. Also re: the recent talk about
repetition as stabilizing/destabilizing. There is a repeated image of the
protagonist's father writing calligraphic messages on her face as a birthday
ritual. She goes on to search for someone to write on/be written on by her. I am
usually annoyed by repetition, and was slightly irritated with it at first, but by
3/4s of the way through was waiting to see this scene again, in its variety of
playings-out with various lovers/acquaintances. She even tried writing on herself.
And the physical beauty of the calligraphic process makes you want to throw away
your keyboard & write with big fat brushes on textured surfaces.

Thanks to Jerome Rothenberg for the attribution of the above to Musso's
son. I had read, son-in-law (namely, Ciano), but can't now find where, nor
why I think Ciano was quoting d'Annunzio. I've been through the index of
the Carpenter _A Serious Character_ . If I could find my _Pound Era_ . . .I
have a hunch it might be there.

My attention was caught by the phrase "pitifully unarmed" in Jerry's note.
Not at all out of place in a letter, indicating as it does (to my mind,
leastwise) some attempt to distance oneself, by way of sympathy with the
underdogs, from the image; some attempt, surely, to be careful of one's
self-presentation. But how out of place it would be in a poem next to that
image! For what difference if the Ethiopians had been armed to the teeth?
Or if instead of Ethiopians, they had been Nazis? Or children in a
wheelchair parade through Columbus, Ohio on July 4th? It would still be a
matter of people being torn limb from limb by high explosive.

For all I know, the line in context may have some such slanting. But as I
have come to know it, it is pure. It neither condemns nor justifies the
act. For what difference if it did ?

So liberated, it allows us to contemplate a number of equivalences : that
flowers open like slowly exploding bombs; that any other form of being
which poets have compared to flowers, may be a form of violence and
destruction; that _opening_ and _death_ can be synonymous; that human
"flowerings" may destroy; that language, freed of obligations to
presentation of self ("I'm a mensch"), can still reveal secrets of
phenomena and sentience.


However, it would make a difference to learn that it described an event in
an uninhabited part of the Sahara. And yet the effect being described would
be, qua phenomenon, the same.

I have no appropriate reference books at hand and am no specialist on
Italian literature or culture (though I can tell you where to get decent
Italian food here in Taipei) but my recollection is that the bombs
opening like flowers was a paraphrase of a remark by one of the Italian
futurists, not Gino Severini but the other one, maybe the one that had an
affair with Mina Loy?  but not, I think, d'Annunzio, who (again, from
profound ignorance) was not a futurist if I remember correctly which I
probably do not.

enough or is it basta?

History is no different than "literary criticism" that attempts to discern
and prove the influences that went into the process of production. It is far
from limited to the final product of that process.

That, in the study of literary history, as in the study of the history of
science, attempts to discern how process and form of product reveal the
thought processes and their changing over a period of time. There is a
distinct overlap between the study of the two kinds of history, in that both
concern themselves with the larger situation around any more specific
instance of subject matter,
and both concern themselves with the ideological underpinnings that are
affective and effective in relation to the product. We attempt to see how
human thought processes evolved, from the artifacts they produced.

Returning to our theme of prognostication, that is a limitation that will
eventually be more and more overcome, as more and more of the thought
processes connected to specific artifacts become more precisely known. That
eventually exceeds a purely logical analysis, of deductive and inductive
reasoning, and becomes more empirical. This has to do with the virtual
interconnections of events, that remain technically legible, even when the
cause-effect connections of traditional empirical observation have long been
broken. The trace, or ghost, of the past, then becomes discernable. There is
information content coded onto the artifacts, and that trail leads to other
artifacts. The interconnected trails can be "read" and meaningfully
interpreted. The event at the crossroads, a hundred years ago, leaves its
trace, and we might read that trace as though a crucial part of history is
replayed as if on a tape recorder. The information is there, and sometimes
glimpsed momentarily by particularly sensitive passers-by, and it is that
very haunting of place that gives us the clue as to the encoded virtual
record attached to artifact of past event. The trail is connected to and
carried along, with the quantum histories of the artifact itself, and with
the past connections any discernable artifact has with other artifacts.

Slowly the study of history will change from an imprecise humanity, full of
conjecture and subjectivity, to a more purely technical, empirical, science.

It is not as simple as every past quantum event being accessible, but we
have yet to learn the rules governing access to quantum histories.
Eventually that will unravel more and more completely and comprehension of
what was once termed "the unseen world", will extend from comprehension of
the virtual phenomenon of gravity to the subtle encoding of quantum mind
events onto non mind artifacts.
Reading the virtual world will no longer be solely the function of organic
systems, known as "psychics", but will be the function of inorganic
machines, increasingly precise in comparison to those traditional human
imprecisions.
The most profound intuitions of the best, most sensitive, historians,
irreducible to logic, will also become the increasingly precise functions of
the newest waves of our technologies.

History, as a subject of study, as we know it, in terms of its methods, will
eventually end. It is certain that it will be replaced by an empirical, and
thus increasingly precise, science that is based upon technologies that are
derivative from natural processes that were previously only exploited,
albeit very imprecisely, by the occult.

I think what you are referring to has a close connection with the difference
between the intuitive and the purely empirical, distinct from the difference
between the logical and the empirical, that I loosely referred to in my
reply to Gancie's most recent quote re: "analysis".

I do not think you and I are so very far apart in our viewpoints. Thanks,
for the detailed response. The sitting and waiting for the right words or
the unknown but sought after idea, to suddenly come to mind, from the
subconscious, is something familiar to most writers. It is, however, hard to
describe as to what that process is. The process seems largely inaccessible.
Therein the problem that you seem to be wrestling with.

It is interesting to note that the mind can be taught to sublimate out of
consciousness an idea or ideas, and to deliberately hold within the
subconscious and/or to work upon those ideas purely within the subconscious,
such that later on the end product that was sought is 'automatically'
produced as something completed. Either the original information embedded
into the subconscious can be called forth and repeated, or the original idea
evolved into a more complete and finished product.

Believe it or not, that sublimation of ideas, into the minds of couriers of
commands and intelligence is not a new phenomenon. Which tells you how
"psychics" attempted to "read" the minds of couriers of sensitive
information in the quite distant past, while the specially trained couriers
of that data attempted to protect it. That occultism goes far back into
ancient times. It is my theory that sensitives were more prevalent then.

In fact it is my own theory as to how the architect, in ancient Egypt, was
able to coordinate the building colossal and extremely precise structures
using a vast workforce, and only extremely limited methods of commensuration.

Also sometimes referred to as primitive jungle sense.

People who know other non human species, such as horses, particularly well,
know that they sometimes have it. They sense it, being more instinctively
connected with the unseen, virtual, world. (Virtual in the superluminal
modern quantum physics sense of "virtual".)

Creepy, here, that the myth of a perfect, a transparent history - which
would presume to restore what has been thought, to locate a "genesis" and
"play it back" as if on a tape recorder - is championed via a technology
fetish and general mathesis of the real.  Creepy, that this presumes to
make the "artifact" eternal; as if a poem remains the same from one
reading to the next.

Of course the language of blurbs is hyperbolic--tremendously, extremely,
superb, amazing, the best, the brightest. It is a form of advertising. A
strictly honest blurb would sound like faint praise indeed:

"Jonathan Mayhew is probably the 10th best poet is Lawrence, Kansas."

Not that there aren't a lot of amazing writers wholly deserving of their
blurbs.

Which brings me to John Matthias. I'm planning on getting his books from
the library later today, but I'm puzzled by why he has never come to my
attention before. What invisible divisions in the poetry universe keep him
out of anthologies and off the radar screens of otherwise informed readers
such as myself, if he is as good as they say?

Now I feel ignorant once again.

Thank you, David, for a marvelous reading of this antique Futuristic line,
with its Shiva-like connotations of ironic rejuvenation.

The only famous person I've ever met, I should tell the List, was David
Bromige, who seized the occasion to hand me a tape recorder. We talked all
night and afterwards the tape was empty - nothing but that familiar
sibiliant hissing of not-so vacant space.  I can testify, however, that
Bromige was able to connect far more than Karl Malone, who flowered the net
with empty bombs.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

     To Joseph Safdie,

     In response to your post, let me say that I agree with you in your
     description and admiration for Rochelle Owens' _New and Collected Work_
     from Junction Press.  I do not, as I stated in my original post on
     this, agree with the way the work was described on the List or on the
     book's back cover. I had heard of Rochelle Owens but had not read her.
     Then her name came up in a discussion of "rants." Her work was
     described as "savage." This made me curious and I decided to read some
     of her work. I wanted especially to see what "rant" and "savage" meant
     to other people/poets. I asked for recommendations and received many.
     Mark Weiss was kind enough to reply and send me a copy(Mark, I am
     grateful, though we disagree about the blurbs). I had specifically
     asked Mark if _New and Collected_ contained "wild" work because of the
     reasons I just stated. He thought so and sent me a sample. "Wild" isn't
     my idea of a "criteria for poetic excellence"(your phrase). It was the
     word I used to describe the way Owens' work had been endorsed on the
     List.

     I don't think anything would be accomplished, either here or via
     backchannel, by comparing different poems and saying, "see, that is
     (or isn't) 'wild.'" Do you agree with Marjorie Perloff's blurb (and
     the Olson review posted by Mark Weiss) that the work is "savage"? I
     find the word "savage" problematic for its ethnographic invocation of
     the primitive as I do your use of the phrase "poetic excellence" for
     its pretensions to universality. Ultimately, all these considerations
     amount to matters of taste.

     Criticizing Owens was not the point of my post; it was to draw
     attention to the fact that there are consistent postings to the List
     that seem very provincial considering the avowed purpose of the List.
     The recent flap over "borrowing," "appropriation" or "stealing"
     (whichever term you prefer) is a good example. Why shouldn't poets be
     as free as visual artists to "steal"? Why the aversion to found texts
     and everyday or techno forms? The "older definition of avant-garde
     work, one that is increasingly codified and canonized" that I wrote
     about is the historical tendency towards enshrining the difficult work
     of the past as the new canon while more recent difficult work goes
     relatively unnoticed. I believe we should resist that tendency as
     strenuously as possible by acknowledging important work from every
     period but staying focused on work and trends that are developing now.
     This is only my opinion. It's what I'd like to see more of on the
     List. I appreciate your response to my post.

I had hoped to stimulate a discussion of Rochelle Owens'rather unusual
work. This apparently is not to be.

So, for the record, the words "wild" and "savage" have the same
ethnographic and neocolonialist connotations, are equally problematic, if
one wishes to read them that way (in French the word "sauvage" covers both
meanings. We derive our word from the French, and until very recently, as
the history of words goes, it was synonymous with the germanic-derived
"wild." Hence, "the wild man of Borneo." Hence, also, the practice of
"wilding," which I think could fairly be called savage in another of the
word's senses).

I haven't noticed any general aversion to appropriation, or found texts, or
"techno forms" on this list--quite the contrary--although there has been
disagreement about some texts. I, for example, don't particularly like Alan
Sondheim's work, for instance, but I don't blame the machine or the machinery.

(Appropriation will always be a tricky issue--is it, in a given instance,
homage or plagiarism? That seems to depend on one's sense of its function
in the work at hand. Consider this--in the early eighties in New York there
were several artists--those with better memories than mine can supply
names--who painted museum copies of old masters, retitled them, and
exhibited them as their own, not meaning to deceive, but to comment on the
cannonical nature of the works in question. This generated some noise. I,
for one, thought it a waste of time, unlike, say, Colescott's
appropriations, where the familiar and the unfamiliar comment on each
other, usually to hilarious effect, as in his "George Washington Carver
Crossing the Delaware.")

It is in the nature of a selected poems that it tends to consist of older
work (this book includes the dates of original publication in its title).
Rochelle is in her 60s. We rarely sum up the work-to-date of poets in their
twenties or thirties in this manner unless they're dead, or unless we're
joking.

I'm sorry Rochelle's poetry didn't meet your needs. Other members of the
list might find it useful, exciting, even "wild." It does seem a waste of
their time to discuss what it isn't before discussing what it is.

I would really appriciate it if people could not send these on; if you feel you have some urgent political cause, then make a web page. By the time you figure out how much money was spent storing and passing on a petition (when you could probably get an order of magnitude more signatures by canvassing a campus), you realize that it's not really helping anybody. This goes for "virus alerts" too, which are almost always hoaxes a la Dawkins' memes.

   So, last night, at St. Marks group reading church for anthologies
   I arrive early to assuage nervousness in drink and am standing
   at urinal stall talking about the weather to a man in a green
   shirt who "looks familiar" but i can't place the context....
   anyway, he stays for 90% of the reading, and then as he leaves
   I realize he looks like ROn Silliman. I ask Drew Gardiner.
   It was Ron Silliman. Thanks for coming Ron Silliman, and
   apologies..........chris

Better: thanks for the recommendation! I've heard nothing but good about this
film on this list. I need to get off my ass and see "Pillow Book" for myself.

Was thinking of "Lost Highway" because of its own flatttened female object of
desire, the enigmatic Patricia Arquette character, which is certainly
characteristic (though not necessarily *bad*) of surrealist lit and film (same
as in Louis Bunuel's "that obscure object of desire"). In lockstep with a
repetitious destiny, she was not the hero ever in the film--that was the Walter
Mitty turned maudit fugitive in the Bill Pullman character. Maybe there was
something there of the Freudian death wish on the part of the maudit (or maudit
wannabe).

I am curious to know whether this conversation was conducted along the lines
of the infamous "urinal law" referred to in one of Ron's poems - I forget
which one - the law that states whenever possible, men will leave at least
one empty urinal between themselves and their fellows. I'd never thought
about this before reading that. Now, I can't think of anything but whenever
I enter a public restroom.

And to think my professors tell me that poetry is dying out,

Would that be Marinetti? Certainly sounds like the sort of thing he would
say. I remember the line chiefly from a Clive James poem with the line
"some blockhead said a bomb was like a flower".

Speaking of futurists, has anyone come across the work of Valentine de
Saint-Point? I've just come across her "Futurist Manifesto of Lust", and
alongside all the usual futurist war cries there are some gorgeous
sentences, like "Lust is the expression of a being projected beyond itself.
.. It is the panic shudder of a particle of the earth."

           BANGKOK, June 4 (Reuters) - Fans of the Spice Girls need not
despair over the departure of Ginger Spice.
            The pop star, whose real name is Geri Halliwell, may have
quit Britain's famed all-girl quintet but she's still very much
with them in the Thai version -- a group of transsexuals known
here as the Spice Gays.
            Akanit Ratanavich, or ``Pretty,'' mimics Ginger Spice in a
red wig, black hot pants and low-cut gown over a pair of
implanted breasts as the group lip-syncs Spice Girls' numbers at
a Bangkok theatre.
            ``Pop fans everywhere might be disappointed with Ginger's
decision to quit the group, but here this Ginger will be with
the show for good to make up for the loss of the real one,''
Pretty said after a recent show before a packed audience.
            ``Its very funny...to act as someone famous that you always
like to be,'' said the 24-year-old singer, who underwent a sex
change operation five years ago.
            ``It was sad news, but I knew that one day, they would come
to this point since they are so famous,'' Pretty added.
            Among the group's renditions, ``Spice Up Your Life'' and
``Wannabe'' were the two Spice Girls numbers that drew the most
applause from a visibly spiced up audience.
            ``People always ask if we are really women. The answer is we
are better than men and we are humans of all seasons,'' said
Pretty.

Ez Bob,

I liked your description of Crash a while back and thot it quite provoking.
Tho I'm not sure I'm getting what you're talking about on this Scanner Dan
thing.

L Bill

<<This reminds us of David Cronenberg's movie "Scanners" and what a leap of
technological speculation, considering the currency of the setting wherein
the story takes place, is represented in that particular depiction.
Cronenberg claims immediacy. Does that frighten us ?  Perhaps that is the
thought that viewers of the film failed to think. What if that is us, today,
right now,
was unthinkable to them. It was too terrifying to contemplate. Similar to
the momentary amnesia that the victims of most serious accidents experience,
at the moment of impact and very often for a short while after that, the
viewers of the film could not think that thought superimposed upon their own
day to day realities. However, in the future, we might easily predict that
that is part of the day to day reality of everyperson.

Chris Stroffolino recalls Shakespeare's "I can see through you like water
in a urinal" (which, presumably.could mean "very little", or "not at all"?)
Following this thread (though not suggesting this is synonymous) I recall
Robin Blaser's "poets are the deodorant-pucks in the urinal of life." (In
_Syntax_, I think).

At least one famous literary friendship was struck up in this way--but
which, I am not recalling. Anyone?

It's fitting that Ron's down-to-earth no-subjects-excluded poetry should be
the occasion of this thread. The more I read him, and the longer I have to
think about him, the greater my amazement that we should have such a poet,
large of heart and of mind (as I once wrote, in a bleak mood ("and ends") I
guess, "American poetry starts with Whitman and ends with Silliman"),
dwelling among us today, a MacArthurian genius if ever there was one.

Now George will nominate him for the Nobull Piss Prize.

A similar quote to the "bombs like flowers" is this passage from
Marinetti.  This is from Perloff's _The Futurist Moment_ p. 30.  She is
quoting Walter Benjamin quoting Marinetti:

"War is beautiful because it initiates the dreamt-of metalization of the
human body.  War is beautiful because it enriches a flowering meadow with
the fiery orchids of machine guns."  etcetera

One of Pessoa's heteronyms has a great poem called "Marinetti, academico,"
which protests the fact that the once avant-garde poet is now inducted
into the academy.  The title says it all.

I don't have anything witty to add about the urinals, unfortunately.

I knew MacArthur (and I've known one writer who received one), and I'd much
rather read Silliman, and spend time with him, too. Yes, I'm with Bromige
there. A good place to be.

After you see it, post your thoughts. I know it's an older film, but I'm still all
excited about seeing it & want to talk about it.

All right, gentlemen (and lady), let's get our minds out of the urinals!
Serious poetics-type disquistion to follow . . .

Peter Balestrieri, whom I thank for his careful and measured post, says
he doesn't

But if this is a discussion merely about the truthfulness of BLURBS,
everyone whom Robert Creeley (in his infinite generosity) has ever said
a kind word about would have some explaining to do! (That would include
most of the people on this List, wouldn't it?) I don't, by the way,
think the blurbs on this back cover are any more hyperbolic than others
I've seen, but that's not the point. There MIGHT be a point, though,
when he says

>
First, here's what Marjorie said --"In its uncompromising savagery, its
passionate rejection of sentimentality, Rochelle Owens' lyric voice is
unique among contemporary poets." I read that as saying "WHEN the work
is savage . . . it's unique" -- I'm not so sure about that (and neither
is Anne Waldman) -- but I value other, quieter pieces in the volume
more, which is why I questioned "wildness" being somehow necessary. Yet,
even a cursory look at the poems included from "Elga's Incantation"
(1962), "Salt & Core" (1968), "I Am the Babe of Joseph Stalin's
Daughter" (1972) and "The Joe 82 Creation Poems" (1974) in this volume
reveals that the voices in them are the opposite of calm, everyday
language -- they jump, they're excited, shamanic, violent, enthused,
other-worldly, "in tongues" -- in a word, they're "savage". (Olson's
review does other things besides calling the work "savage" -- for
example, describes its linguistic elements -- and I have no quarrels
with it, it seems accurate to me.)

Mark Weiss has posted rather eloquently earlier today about the possible
neocolonialist connotations of the word, and I bow to his considerations
-- (Mark, were the paintings you mentioned the subject of the late Orson
Welles movie called "Fraud"?) -- but the last lines from your post above
are also interesting to me. I've been . . . dissatisfied . . . lately
with the expression "it's all a matter of taste," because it seems
merely a way to end discussion about matters one doesn't want to
consider anymore -- in the worst case scenario (which I'm NOT accusing
you of), it means "we can't talk about this, because my taste is
obviously better and more advanced than yours." So I ask you -- is the
phrase "poetic excellence" really a "pretension to universality"?
Indeed, "excellence is sparse" -- but are you suspicious of the very
IDEA of excellence? -- must we "deconstruct" it? -- some criticize Ezra
Pound for believing in the "great man" theory of history -- others, I
think, criticize the CONCEPT of "greatness" itself -- Is that what
you're doing? Can there be no more "great poets"? Are writers who aspire
to "greatness" barking, as it were, up the wrong post-modern tree? I
hope not.  WCW said early on that he could see nothing to aim for except
greatness, which has always stayed with me, even though I'm never going
to make it; I've been fortunate enough to have known several great
poets, and they've enriched my life, and I say that completely without
embarrassment.

>
        Peter Balestrieri, meet Mark Prejsnar! But really, I understand
that you weren't criticizing Owens and am glad that you appreciate her
work, as I do more and more the more I read it. Check out, for example,
"Devils Clowns & Women" near the end of the volume (a Mark Weiss
recommendation) which seems to me one of the finer love poems in the
language, reminding me of "Asphodel" and a great poem by Muriel Rukeyser
which has the repeated refrain "yes, my love, we are looking at each
other" (title, anyone?) Un-sentimental love is . . . excellent!

        It was nice to meet you this way, Peter, and I look forward to
more dialogue. And now . . . back to the urinals!

Suppository understood as a term of rhetoric. Early morning, cheap
ballpoint pen falls into a urinal in the fourth-floor men's room who
knows how? never to be removed, to become a target, moved willfully by
streams of urine, pushed counter clockwise around the white who knows
what it is made of? urinal cake. Returning in the rain from the old
brick bank to the car, I realize that I forgot to feed the meter, had
scurried right past it in my hurry to stay dry, only to have gotten by
without a ticket, little gift of fate. Kitaj's eyes.

"The naivete of speaking about "objectivity" without ever considering
subjectivity as experiencing, knowing, and actually concretely
accomplishing, the naivete of the scientist of nature or of the world in
general, who is blind to the fact that all the truths that he attains as
objective truths and the objective world itself as the substratum of his
formulae (the everyday world of experience as well as the higher-level
conceptual world of knowledge) are his own life-construct developed
within himself-this naivete is naturally no longer possible as soon as
his life becomes the point of focus. And must this liberation not come
to anyone who seriously immerses himself in the Treatise and, after
unmasking Hume's naturalistic presuppositions, becomes conscious of the
power of his motivations?"---from The Crisis of the European Sciences

For Tom Beard and other interested parties:

Nancy Moore has done an interesting PhD thesis on Valentine.  You can
contact Nancy via Jerry Bruns (her husband, probably known to this list
through his brilliant books, most recent one on Blanchot) at Notre Dame
or on email <Gerald L. Bruns.1@nd.edu>.   Nancy did a lot of research in
Europe and hopes to publish her book (Northwestern U PhD)--contact her
thru Northwestern would also be possible.

Some people on the poetcs list have indicated that they're having trouble
getting at the Otis Rush magazine web site.  The same address seems to be
working ok for some people but not all.  The solution is to go via the
address of the Experimental Art Foundation's site (on which Otis Rush
piggy-backs) - viz:

   http://www.eaf.asn.au

Tou'll find lots of interest there, along with Otish Rush magazine.

Eventually the problem of interpretation is overcome. Not immediately,
but eventually.

We know that the Field Marshall spilled hot porridge onto his uniform in the
morning and ordered an immediate attack against the opponent in a conflict.
History never mentionned the porridge before and historians had dozens of
theories why the attack was suddenly ordered to commence. Now we know.

We have to realize that the quantum histories are incredibly vast. The
virtual data traces as to past events make the entire universe equivalent to
being a
vast computer "hard drive". We simply have to learn to access and decode the
information that is stored in connection with that manifested vehicle. The
data is virtual (using the physics definition of virtual) and the storage
medium, by analogy, is the material stuff (organic and inorganic taken as a
whole) that traditional empiricism is somewhat familiar with. The data,
being virtual, is at mathematical "infinity", and therefore it can be
accessed at a remote distance super-luminally in what is effectively zero
elapsed time. The only time requirement then is the time for the technology
that is accessing and interpreting to do that portion of its work that
remains subluminal (non virtual).

The practical difficulty of having all the relevant virtual data, at hand,
becomes the barrier to a purely empirical understanding of history. We fill
the gaps in our empirical understanding with interpretation. Interpretation
arises from ignorance of precisely observed causalities, or histories of
causalities.
Interpretation fills in the gaps, based on logical functions such as
conjecture, assumption, expert opinion, etc. It is therefore a weakness, as
far as empiricism is concerned and is not in fact a higher function. It is
simply the failure to have sufficient data at hand so as to "know" with
certainty.

Interpretation is largely creative. It adds something to what is there. It
is not to be found in the thing itself, or the events themselves. When we
phenomenologically bracket out any interpretations, so as to arrive at the
thing in itself, or quantum histories in themselves, we arrrive at a purely
precise and empirical knowledge. Filling in gaps in knowledge, using
traditionally accepted logical and intuitive methods, leads to probabilities
as to errors.
There are no theories then as to what happened.

Since mental events are material quantum events and encoded onto the
universal data base there could eventually be no doubt as to motivations,
intentions, purposes, goals, etc. Those would be knowable as empirical facts.

What I was referring to was ever increasing certainty as to quantum
histories, implying ever increasing certainty as to human histories as a
whole. That means less and less interpretation, as it becomes increasingly
empirical. That means less and less recourse to theories.

I suggest that technology eventually arrives, by various mechanisms, at a
reading of human history, and of the history of the universe, that is purely
empirical and accurate, requiring no further interpretation. As empirically
accurate as a properly functionning computer hard drive allows the mechanism
within it to recover its own stored data and allows the mechanism to replay
it in an orderly, logically connected, fashion, with repeatable accuracy. It
does so by its very nature, as functions as its inventors meant it to
function. I am suggesting that the universe, by analogy, functions the same
way.

Is there a continuing possibility of variant, considered correct, literary
intpretation, of a poem for example, if the qunatum histories involved in
its production are fully known ?  We could attribute other readings, other
than any that the author meant to include. Those accidental attributions,
that accrue to works of art, need to be included as such, but then we know
they are exactly that, and we also know exactly what old Bill meant when he
wrote that sonnet,
hundreds of years ago. We know Shakespeare wrote it, and we know exactly
what was on his mind. The virtual, "unseen", world contains those traces,
all still connected with the chain of quantum histories linking Bill's work
to its first origination. Similarly with the first event at the origination
of the universe.
There comes a point in future time when it is no longer possible to give an
interpretation to Bill's sonnet production. The history of the sonnet,
provides its meaning as the communication of self to self and self to others
that it was for Bill and the relevant contemporaries. It also reveals what
that sonnet was to their successors.

In effect we can look at the history of a sonnet, and we can then look into
Bill's mind. Since our probe, probes virtual space-time,along the T axis, it
accesses "infinity". The virtual ghost of Bill's mind, is also at
"infinity". The probe in effect accesses Bill's mind and retrieves the data
to the present point along the axis t, to our normal empirical space-time
coordinates.

The threads in the string, begin there. From the the rope is woven.

Bill then hangs from that evolving rope exactly as we hang from that same rope.

The setting of the movie "Scanners" was completely contemporaneous with its
time of production. The technology appeared completely futuristic. That
juxtaposition becomes the most horrific moment in the thriller, and yet
it is that very juxtaposition of contemporaenous and futuristic that is
ignored by the average viewer. It is as if traumatic amnesia takes hold
of the viewer after the initial shock of contemporaneity. That's really all
I wanted to say about that.

"Let us accept the viewpoint, the chief progenitor of which is probably
Hume, that there are just three modes of discourse: discourse about the
empirical world (positive discourse), discourse about what is logically
necessary (roughly the same as pure mathematics), and ethical and
aesthetic discourse (discourse which makes value judgements). The first
two discuss what is, the last discusses what ought to be; but from what
is, with no assumptions about what ought to be, we cannot derive any
propositions about what ought to be; and from what ought to be we can
conclude nothing about what is. The third mode is therefore to be
distinguished from the first two. BUT THE FIRST TWO MUST ALSO BE
DISTINGUISHED FROM EACH OTHER; for no purely logical truth can tell us
anything about the real world, nor can empirical facts yield logical
truths. The three modes of discourse are therefore closed off from each
other.
Of the three modes of discourse,science rejects the third entirely. It
is not concerned with value judgements. It uses the second (logic) but
only as a tool. Essentially it is concerned with the real world,
although to discuss the real world IT USES LOGIC IN ORDER TO DEDUCE ONE
EMPIRICAL STATEMENT FROM ANOTHER."---from Paradoxes of Rationality:
Theory of Metagames and Political Behavior by Nigel Howard
---
"Classification is a condition for cognition and not cognition itself;
cognition in turn dispels classification."---from Dialectic of
Enlightenment by Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno
---
"'Tis usual with mathematicians, to pretend, that those ideas, which are
their objects, are of so refined and spiritual a nature, that they fall
not under the conception of fancy, but must be comprehended by a pure
and intellectual view, of which the superior faculties of the soul are
alone capable....'Tis easy to see why philosophers are so fond of this
notion of some spiritual and refined perceptions; since by that means
they cover up many of their absurdities, and may refuse to submit to the
decisions of clear ideas, by appealing to such as are obscure and
uncertain. But to destroy this artifice, we need but reflect on that
principle so oft insisted on, that all ideas are copied from our
impressions. For from thence we may immediately conclude, that since all
impressions are clear and precise, the ideas, which are copy'd from them
must be of the same nature, and can never, but from our fault, contain
any thing so dark and intricate....
Reason is the discovery of truth and falsehood. Truth or falsehood
consists in an agreement or disagreement either to the real relations of
ideas, or to real existence and matter of fact. Whatever, therefore, is
not susceptible of this agreement or disagreement, is incapable of being
true or false, and can never be an object of our reason."---from A
Treatise of Human Nature by David Hume
---
"...[T]he fact that it can be described by Newtonian mechanics tells us
nothing about the world; but this tells us something, namely, that the
world can be descibed in that particular way in which as a matter of
fact it is described."---from Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus by Ludwig
Wittgenstein

I met Ted Joans in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1981. He was putting a
collection together for Handshake Editions in Paris at the time. Whether
that collection was or wasn't the Selected Poems referred to in Dorothy
Wang's post, I can't say. I never saw it. But the time was right. Bill

"Formulation of ideas is not an independent process, strictly rational
in the old sense, but is part of a particular grammar, and differs, from
slightly to greatly, between different grammars. WE DISSECT NATURE ALONG
LINES LAID DOWN BY OUR NATIVE LANGUAGES. The categories and types that
we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because they
stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is
presented in a kaleidoscopic flux of impressions which has to be
organized by our minds--and this means largely by the linguistic system
in our minds. We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe
significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement
to organize it in this way--an agreement that holds throughout our
speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language. The
agreement is of course, an implicit and unstated one, BUT ITS TERMS ARE
ABSOLUTELY OBLIGATORY; we cannot talk at all except by suscribing to the
organization and classification of data which the agreement decrees.

too. And when someone tells me what he knows about something, he
provides me with new evidence only by confronting me with new sensory
data: I hear him speak, and I have evidence of his truthfulness, i.e. as
to the likelihood that the sounds he makes will tally with my experience
in appropriate ways; and therefore I treat the occurrence of my auditory

Loosely stated my response is this:

I firmly believe, on empirical grounds, that there is a fundamental error
in this. The process, significantly for the arts and thus for poetics,
similarly as for the most progressive in the sciences, is a process of
non-verbal to verbal. It is a process of knowing something non
linguistically and then attempting to put that into words. That is,
communication of the observation, of the world or of the idea, is a process
of finding the words for it. I do agree that sometimes we make the error of
saying that the observable does not exist because there are no words for it.
We too easily limit the universe, and the predication of existence, to the
already namable. Science does this less than the arts. The arts, where they
use language, are more prone to that error.

Language, in fact, evolves, along lines determined by the empirical
observation of the world. (I hesitate to distinguish natural from non
natural, because it is all ultimately "of nature" and even what is made by
our own species is a natural product of a natural species. There is nothing
unnatural. The arbitrary and pragmatic distinction between what human beings
make and what else there is,
is misleading as to our place within the whole, as another variant part of it.)

Language evolves to accomodate new observations of the world. It is the
conservatism of language, its resistance to change, as its necessary
function of the preservation of commonly understood meanings, that sometimes
stands against progress, and slows acceptance of the inclusion of more and
more anomalies within new paradigms. It slows the expression of new
paradigms into a more commonly communicable and understandable linguistic form.

If the observation occurs and there are no words to describe it, as in
instances of anomalies, there has been the tendency to fail to accord it its
reality. We do tend to make the error that language is inclusive rather than
exclusive. It does tend to be exclusive, mirroring social structures.
Language has always been essentially a political tool, as well as a
conveyance for what was considered acceptable ideology. As I said, we do
tend to limit our empirical observations to what a-priori language is able
to name. That magick of naming is in itself an error that we have slowly
overcome. We have learned that we can always create a new name for a new
thing, or new descriptors for a new observation that defies the limits of
language prior to that advance. Slowly we have become more accustomed to the
fact that the universe is full of things that as of yet we have no names
for, and cannot yet call upon, much less command. However we shall name
them, and we shall commend them, to our purposes, stands at the very
foundation of modern scientific progress, in radical distinction, from any
interpersonal equalities. (Also, potentially in conflict.)

In most instances the creative process itself begins with a non linguistic
idea and gains partial or complete expression, precisely or imprecisely, into
words. The sub-conscious does not work primarily linguistically. It works
proto and pre linguistically.

In the ancient past, it is my firm belief, that the conscious sense of this
was far less exceptional, and much more common. This relates to my comment
about the building of the massive monuments of ancient Egypt. It is as if
the pictogram, or hieroglyph is more natural to humankind. The first
language then being more visual than sonic. The projection of the image of
what is to be built to the uneducated workmen, by the skilled architect,
such that a hundred or more workmen can work in precise unison creating a
massive, near perfect, statue, or structure, such that no one workman can
see enough of the other workmen's work with his own eyes, so as to be able
to properly guage his own individual actions. Of course, without precise
blueprints, and with limited means of measurement, measurement is not enough
to explain the phenomenon. We therefore
begin to understand that they were trained to follow a non verbal jungle sense
more common to the consciousness of our distant ancestors. There is an
interesting mythology and depiction of the methods for opening the minds of
the workers to the receipt of transmission, and it is psychologically valid
in terms of what has been learned about stimulatind and developing latent
psi abilities
in human subjects.

It is interesting that Colonel John Alexander has written, in his
discussions of "remote viewing", that the roots of modern advances can, in
some instances, be traced back to ancient Egypt. Of course he writes about
warriors and future war.

There is at least one sect of Wiccans who feel similarly as to the origins of
naturally available and specially trained psi abilities. They follow the
same Egyptian methodology to awaken psi abilities.

Psionic or psychotronic power is natural organic systems enhanced by, or
replicated in principle into non organic systems, where those inorganic devices
have variable precision. The quest then is not only to duplicate the
abilities of organic systems, but to build machines that exceed those
abilities in terms of their precision.

However, that only reminds us that pre-linguistic visuatization precedes and
oversteps language in significant ways. Psi, (often loosely called "psychic")
abilities are traditionally closely related to non linguistic data, as much
as is most of artistic creativity, other than literature. Literature often
makes the error of claiming pre-eminence and putting cart in front of horse,
then asking the horse to pull it.

The poet struggles to turn, usually sub-conscious, non linguistic information
into a fountain of precisely chosen and structured words, so as to give some
communicative conveyance of the pre-linguistic ideas.

True, but there are a multitude of private languages. There are also a
multitude of very specialist languages, unique to small groups, who do not
necessarily or always share their entire meaning with outsiders.

This, in a very simple instance, is the difference between mathematical
"infinity" and true "infinity". The term becomes confused, unless we look
very carefully at the situational context that it is used within, and know
that mathematicians often use it differently.

Science is full of such limitings, stretchings and re-definitions of language.
It no longer allows language to be its limit.

The poet, however, is usually in a more constrained situation. There is less
freedom to create language, but language must be used as is given. Few poets
transcend that limitation. It is often considered a poetic taboo to 'create
new language' as opposed to use language as predecessors have used it. The
very nature of language as as a system of precedents makes language more
conservative than science.

"Wahington (Reuters)- The U.S. military used lethal nerve gas during the
Vietnam War, targeting American defectors in a village base camp in
Laos, CNN and Time magazine said in a joint report on Sunday.
Adm. Thomas Moorer, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
confirmed that sarin nerve gas was used in 1970 in a secret raid into
Laos called Operation Tailwind, according to the report aired on CNN
Sunday.
Capt. Eugene McCarthy, commander of the mission, told the program
"Newstand: CNN & Time" that "upwards of 100" people perished in the
raid, including women and children. Platoon leader Lt. Robert Van
Buskirk estimated up to 20 American military defectors were killed."

Marjorie Perloff March 96 on Regis Bonvicino

"He notices, for example, that time has a way of transforming, not only
such obvious items as leaves and flowers, but that even the graffiti on the
walls fade and that their absence oddly presents the observer with a loss.
And he also knows -- having put himself to school with such U.S. masters as
William Carlos Williams, Robert Creeley, and George Oppen -- that the
location of the small words -- entre, como, alguem -- are as important as
their more pretentious cousins, the big nouns that claim to point to the
great truths about experience.  This is a poetry in which lineation is the
"bone" on which the "butterfly" is suspended, the wire on which word,
morpheme, even the silence of empty space, become elements pregnant with
meaning."

 - Claude Royet-Journoud on Bonvicino (specially for this reading)

"It is the mutual observation of a body and a language, in the minute
slowness of the world which cries out the surprising richness of Regis
Bonvicino's work.  At times it reminds us of the powerful and striking
narrative of a Larry Eigner or a Robert Creeley.  An imperceptible
movement shakes up the surface which, under our eyes, collapses and, just
as soon, is reconstituted.  Nevertheless, it remains out of reach.  One
can only grasp the violent cesura of the work.

Don't miss it!!!

I am currently at work on the issue of anarchy and dissent in American
poetry during the 1960s. Could anyone suggest poems & reading on that
specific subject?
Any help will be most appreciated.
Thank you,

Maggie --

WFMU plays things. I forget how to find them -- they have a web page --
Kenny Goldsmith could say more. WKCR (89.9 FM) plays jazz, country, blues,
they used to do some ok hip hop, Garam Masala's a terrific raga show,
Composed on the Tongue has more fiction than poetry these days, but the
host changes from year to year, so it's worth trying on the odd Sunday at
8:30 pm. Otherwise, you're pretty much stuck with NPR's local, WNYC (93.9
FM, AM 820), or Pacifica's WBAI (again, I forget the call numbers). Susan
Howe had a show on BAI ages ago, and All Things Considered has Cathy Bowman
on now and again to contextualize a reading by someone from work that's
usually energetic and sometimes surprising if almost-always anecdote-based.
WNYE (91.5 FM) plays poetry every Tuesday and Thursday at 11:45 a.m.
Anybody interested in reading on that show should e-mail me, I'll put you
in touch with the host, Irwin Gonshak. WNYE is the NY Board of Ed's
station, and they rent out blocks of time to Greek, Chinese and Francophone
broadcasters, so if you hear French radio late at night in a cab, it's
probably 91.5. And then there's Howard Stern, Rush Limbaugh, etc etc etc.
Caspar Citron is still on the air, somewhere on AM, quick, which Frank
O'Hara poem does Citron appear in?

Thanks to everyone who pitched in with suggestions to help me with my
query about Ted Joans' Wow. With the help of a reference librarian here at
UC-Berkeley, I was able to locate Joans (who now lives in Seattle) and
spoke with him by phone. He told me that Wow was scheduled to be published
in 1981 by a Canadian publisher but, because Joans isn't Canadian, the
project ran into problems and was never realized. He says that a woman in
Seattle plans to put out Wow in chapbook form in Spring 1999.

Jesus & Christians were symbolized as donkeys in pre-Christian Rome.

Then Dante faced up to it & climbed through Satan's ass.

Whew! YHWH!  Gesundtheit!

Put a frame around it & you can say anything.  "I been framed".

We get scared when you take away the frame.  So we say, hey, I'm an artist,
the frame is everywhere.

Prison is a frame-up.

today on NPR they interviewed an expert on Nigeria.  The NPR lady asked him
why Nigerians put up with a dictator for so long?  Well, it's been a
tragedy & they're a very diverse country.  Any hope for democracy?
Well, maybe.  They didn't discuss the fact that Nigeria is a oil-based
economy controlled by an elite & the US never turned off the tap.
Hypocrisy is the perfume of repression.

Subject:      Distributed Image of the Internet in - r* and similar commands:
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

[This might be of interest to anyone concerned with the poetics of the Net
itself, the relationships among nodes and protocols. For "Nikuko" or
"Alan" for example are merely symptoms carried in datagrams and packets
across the wires, often broken up along the way, only to be reassembled
later.

The early Net was one of comparative transparency, and a number of shell
commands are, literally, apropos. Alan]


_______________________________________________________________________


Distributed Image of the Internet in - r* and similar commands:


Clearly, at one point the imaginary of network distribution and function
was based to some extent on considering telnet a universal protocol or
protocol suite (in fact the World Wide Web is at telnet port 80), creating
a group of r- (remote) commands as well, unifying both local and remote
machines/hosts. There is rwho, rstat, rup, ruptime, rsh, rlogin, rdist,
rcp, etc. The last is remote copy; rdist is for (usually) periodic dist-
ributions of updated files; rlogin and rsh allow remote logins using files
and bypassing passwords. These and others are demonstrated below.

The image or vision, now remotely backgrounded, is that of a skein of
nodes or sites, all of which are transparent to one another - almost down
to the hardware. Finger is another important component here, since it
displays or splays information concerning a particular user - what was
once thought of as freedom, is now thought of as invasion of privacy,
often across firewalls. Even now, however, you will find rusers still
implemented on some systems, returning the current online users.

(Note that intranets provide a shadowy parallel to all of this - but in-
tranets exist in atmospheres of tight security, are corporate-driven, and,
if anything, are the result of mistrust and exclusion. I like to think of
the r-commands as looser, the result of at least a translucent net and a
belief, related to hacker ethos, of the relative freedom of information.)

Besides rlogin, with the proper .rhosts file, rsh still seems to work
between panix3.panix.com and gol1.gol.com. rsh is a login from a local
shell to a remote one.

For any of the following, you may use the "man <command>" pages at the
unix prompt; for other information, try "apropos <attribute>" at the same.
Most of the demonstration below uses panix (US) and gol (Japan); a third
site is murdoch (Australia). The output of "apropos remote" is appended.


Here is rup - status of hosts:

{k:7} rup cleo.murdoch.edu.au
cleo.murdoch    up 39 days, 13:26,    load average: 0.08, 0.05, 0.05


Here is rstat - from gol1.gol.com where it remains implemented:

{k:1} rstat cleo.murdoch.edu.au
  8:10am  up 39 days, 13:29, load average: 0.04 0.05 0.05

Ginsberg said something similar in one of the poems he wrote, a few
years before he became a wholly disembodied poetic bodhisattva.

I wonder why Edward Teller and Ginsberg had that commonality of experience.

Perhaps someone is lying about Teller ?

barbara -

1)  i'm a poet who frequently yogues.

2)  i envision a back which is broadening as well as lengthening
as a back which is making a huge "X"
from shoulder to opposite hip
AND
as a back which "rectangulizes"
from shoulders to hips



that's about the extent of my putting the two together - so far.
so, -
thanks for the inspiration

what's the connection do for you?

Though minimalism is usually the exact opposite of anarchy.

Minimalism being the exploration of fundamental principles of order
rather than an ever increasing free reign of chaos.

Minimalism can be seen as a return to the exploration of the most fundamental
roots of composition and sonic expression. It is a primal expression of basic
paradigms and principles, reasserted in clearest relief against anarchic noise.

Cage was exploring the very bars that the cage was made from.
Proving that names are very important antecedents.

I have to take issue with some of what's sprung up here surrounding both JML and Cage.
Beware of associating "chance" with "compositional anarchy" -- as I'm sure that JML at least
would be troubled by that connection. And as has been pointed out all too often, the term
"chance" doesn't really describe the procedures used by JML (or, for that matter Cage). As
Mordecai-Mark Mac Low (an astrophysicist at the Max Plank (sp?) institute in Heidelberg)
pointed out to his father some years ago, these "chance" procedures are really more
"deterministic" than anything else. Jackson called them "algorithmic" in a recent letter.
And while there might be a connection between such a proceduralism and an anarchist
politics, I think that most anarchists would freak out at the idea of having their politics
reduced to a philosophical anarchism of the aesthetic variety. But we could talk about that.
JML has at turns denied such a connection between his politics and at others said that the
performance pieces were "analogies" for intentional communities. Personally, it seems to me
that making that connection stresses the "individualist" anarchism of Tucker, etc., and the
american anarchists of the 19th century, which lead in no uncertain terms to the
anti-statism of the anti-govt paranoids on the right, while the majority of "anarchists"
with whom we'd know about come from the anarcho-communist heritage of Bakunin, Emma Goldman,
etc. (and that's the lineage of most poets who were involved in that movement). So, it seems
to me that the question has to come from another angle.

Also, I don't get how either Cage or JML are "minimalist"   In fact, both Cage and Mac Low
seem much more maximalist, where the signifying capacity of words is overburdened, rather
than emptied out. There are plenty of examples. Maybe some of the work like "Barnesbook"
would be minimalist, but then that comes from a particular use of that program "Diastext"
which also seems a long way from "anarchy" and even Barnesbook isn't minimalist in the way
that say,   I dunno, errr, Cid Corman or someone might be considered minimalist. Any
thoughts?

Also- I got the sense also that Manuel meant something different. Please explain what you
mean.

I always took Bernadette Mayer's work to have more to do with anarchy in
the Bakunin/Kropotkin sense that the state the governance of things in
some ordinary tight-ass way is irrelevant and if things if people were
left to take care of themselves without the state then people would make
an effort to make sure everything was seen to, viz. Utopia and Mutual Aid
and cf. the total complete works of Clark Coolidge.

Of course the random side of anarchy is nice too, and the punk circle A
has its glints of inspiration.

But Manuel Brito wanted to know about anarchism poetry and the 60s and
Bernadette's so-called anarchist works come later.

AFTER, by Douglas Messerli

Yes, it's my first new book of poetry in years! (If you
discount the STRUCTURE OF DESTRUCTION series as poetry).
After began in the late 1970s, when I was trying to under-
stand why Baudelaire was interesting in English. I certainly
couldn't tell it from the then-available translations. So
I began my own poems "after" Baudelaire....and then after
Rimbaud, Mallarme, Sor Juana, Verlaine and many others.
I then began alternating these poems with my "own" poetry
influenced by some of the formal devices and occasionally
thematic concerns of the "after" poems. The result is a book
in which Milton sounds like a "language" poet (whatevr that
my mean), in which the write through "The Acquaintance" by Robert
Frost, I retranslate a poem by Rae Armantrout from the French
back into English, and write a poem "After Lorca after Spicer."
The result I think is serious poetry and good fun.
$10.95 (available on the list with a 20% discount).


THE EFFORT TO FALL, by Christopher Spranger.

Annihilation--how many sleepless nights I have spent repeating
this word to myself in ectasy!

The prrof of wisdom is not knowledge by weariness, and he
that is absolutely weary is absolutely wise.

Misery being coextensive with life, a happy moment may be defined
as any moment occurring either before we are born or after we
die.

I want the ideal performance--the one which exists only in the
composer's mind; not the real performance which requires conductor
and orchestra.

A book of pity and brilliant observations, aphorism at its best.

...differences in tone and intent and general impact, in "violent"
lines--is a very disturbing and engaging topic.  Especially because it
reflects so well  the character of our culture.

I still feel that Andrews' I Don't Have Any Paper... is the key reference
point here.  The first two quotes Bill gives, have first a localized
reference; only seconarily do they get involved with the abrasions that
are general (but they do do so..) Also, they betray more than a little
anxiety about the poet's place in our rough and tumble demikulchah..

The Watten is more like the Andrews:  it's implicated in ongoing violence
in a deliberately hurtful and "unforgiveable" way.

On Sunday L.A. Books held the last reading of its initial series.  Paul
Vangelisti and Dennis Phillips read from their recent work, and a great
time was had by all.  Paul read from a variety of work, including a
series of poems ordered by the days of the week (all eight of them) and a
novel-in-verse (_Gold Mountain_) about a bordello in 19th century Los
Angeles.  Dennis read from a book-length work, _Sand_.  Spotted in the
audience were, in no particular order, Standard Schaefer, Guy Bennett,
Martha Ronk, Diane Ward, Franklin Bruno, Evan Calbi, Mark Salerno, and
Martin Nakell.

We've had three previous readings for this series (held at Cafe Balcony
in west L.A.): Douglas Messerli and Joe Ross, Leslie Scalapino and Diane
Ward, Guy Bennett and Martha Ronk.

A new series begins in September, and we're still working on the schedule.

In the next couple days, I'm hoping to have photos and a couple sound
files from the reading online at the LITPRESS.COM site.

As many of you know, the announcement of new books at the litpress site
has lagged behind my original intention of updating once a week. It's
more like once a month. Bit off more than I could chew on that one, but I
will keep doing the announcements, and a new list of them will be up
later this week.  Thanks for your patience.

I've been listening to the media reaction to the nerve gas story.  the defense
department says there's no documented history of any use of nerve gas, or
targeting defectors with extreme prejudice.  some of those who were involved
are apparently having a difficult time dealing with their participation in
these "elite" death squads, and they are trying to come clean; I can
understand this.  it's a surprise, but it shouldn't be, to sensitive folks
when they discover that, as they grow older, their ability to repress the full
context of their participation in behavior that is in fact abhorrent to them
is significantly impaired.  (I'm not talking about the most vicious among us
who haven't developed a conscience.)  the media, for the moment, has been
caught unawares; they haven't gotten their instructions yet, but the general
trend seems to heading toward `well, it was a dirty thing to do, but it was a
dirty war,' as if our prior atrocities somehow justified this one.  this is
pretzel torture a la scalia; a parade of middle-aged men who thought that
anything that was used to help them in the perpetuation of that illegal war
was also justifiable.  yet given the literally sacred vow that this country
would never be the first to use "these terrible weapons" , and the approbation
heaped on the head of saddam, why is the moral dimension appearing as an
afterthought?  this is a good measuring stick for the immediate future, and
whether or not you should keep your passport current and a cash stash.  if
there is no significant outcry (really, in any other western country the
people would be in the streets) then this will be interpreted (correctly) by
our master class that such behavior, having been justified in the past, is
thus justified in the present.  the absurdity of such a logical premise is
matched in my memory only by those of the Nazi's, who, having absolute
control, had absolute contempt for the intelligence of their minions.  if we
have reached this level, and I think we have, then the decades-old attempt by
the elite to desensitize a populace sensitized by the war has succeeded, and
anything is possible; chomsky can crawl home to die -- the propaganda war has
been lost, and only subversion is believable.

To J. Kuszai:

You make some good points; in fact I don't think Cage and Mac Low work/ed
with any kind of simplistic parallel between anarchism and the procedures
they use/d.

The original query was about poets influenced by anarchism...And from the
point of view of their subjective political beliefs, these are indeed the
first two that ought to be mentioned.

What in fact the relation is between those beliefs and their work,
including form and procedure, is (as you suggest) complex and mediated.
But (to my limited knowledge) anarchism as a tradition has had some
influence on 'em, as individuals...

Though it is the furthest from poetry yet, the Russians had chemical warfare
materials in the 1960s. The Chinese might have had some too. It is not a
very complicated technology.

It is the defectors who were the losers in the propaganda war, regardless of
any further analysis as to historical outcome. They were not really
defectors, but instead "prisoners of war", of a peculiar kind. Their minds
twisted beyond any semblance of sanity by a constant barrage of radio
frequencied Hanoi propaganda.
The psychological warfare side of Nam has yet to be written, and much of
what was endured is still presumably too classified to become historical data.

The usual strategy is to attempt, often at high cost in assets, to liberate
prisoners of war. If that fails, then the second strategy is to attempt to
minimize damage, in terms of preventing increased human suffering being
brought upon a larger number. In effect, actions meant to minimize, or at
least decrease immediate and long term damages to one's own assets.
Consideration is usually given, if possible, to the sufferings being endured
by the prisoners. Presumably the defectors in question were not being
tortured into defecting, but I do not know if we have that side of that
story right either. Some prisoners defected as the result of brainwashing
and torture. Some were technical specialists that the Soviets badly wanted
to break, in order to gain larger advantage than that which could be
attained solely within the limited geographic space of Vietnam. So it is
very very complicated. The news media typically oversimply, while other
sources attempt to obfuscate the brutal and horrific truths as to the nature
of human military conflict in any overt confrontation.

Mark:  indeed.

A Meow Press book currently in production, not\"scheduled" although
it may appear this summer is

"War Poems and Sonnets" by Jackson Mac Low, tho it may not be called that
when he gets thru with it.

It includes Jackson's anti-war poems dating back to his Sandburg
influenced high school poems, early sonnets written in September 1939 and
selected "peacenik" and anti war poems up through "Marines Defend Burning
of Village" which Jerry R. published in a magazine in the late 60s.
Jackson was involved with the "Why?" and later "Resistance" group during
the war, something which has lead me to a consideration of underground
publications by C.O.s. Mac Low and Paul Goodman were among those who
picketed the Federal Penn. at Danbury CT, where anarchist heroes such as
David Wieck were hunger striking to protest the segregation of the prison
mess hall. They were successful. I think JML was also the first person
ever arrested for protesting nuclear testing, during a civil defense
emergency test. Also arrested included Bayard Rustin, Judith Malina, among
others (tho JML was protesting the tests and not the civil defense
emergency alert).

for more on Mac Low and this question, check out Louis Cabri's very well
documented and thorough introduction to this period in the CRAYON issue
edited by Andrew Levy and Bob Harrison..

I didn't mean to suggest that they weren't committed anarchists, but that
such a relation to their work was problematic. I think there's more of a
connection to Morton Feldman, and contemporary music of the mid-50s than
an explicitly "anarchist" take on poetry/composition. blah blah blah.

but I am interested in the 1960s as a condition for the ferment of
anarchist activity (action and thought, if we want/should to separate them
here). As a child born under the sign of Hendrix & Coolidge, I'd be
interested to hear more on this periodd that Manuel initially proposed.

Duncan's take on the Vietnam War would be another place to look, the
debate between him and the late Denise Levertov etc. which is a book New
Directions has currently somewhere in production... (or so I hearz)/ I
mean their correspondence, which Marjorie Perloff has written about
recently...............but ah, I'm wasting time. Somebody else take the
mic

Perhaps the connection between Mac Low, Cage, and anarchism lies in the
lack of central authority in the aleatory method.  This is the case at
least I think with some of Cage's works; Mac Low seems more procedural than
anarchic, but even so, the openness to allowing the formal constraints to
freely shape the material leaves little room for authorial intention (this
may not work for Mac Low's "intentional" pieces (Forties, for example,
written quickly but intentionally)

        After the disillusionment with the CP, anarchism was about the only
radical
political alternative.  Several of the poets and writers had some connection
with the  anarchistic magazine _Why_ in New York before and during WW II.  I
think Duncan and Mac Low first met at an anarchist meeting in New York,
possibly at the Spanish Anarchists' Hall on lower Broadway, where there were
regular Saturday-night meetings.  After Duncan returned to California, Duncan
and Lamantia (after a Sacco and Vanzetti memorial organized by the WWW)
started an anarchist group which met first at Rexroth's house and was fairly
active for some time. William Everson, Thomas Parkinson, Sanders Russell, and
Jack Spicer were involved.

        I have recently become aware of an interesting Norwegian anarchistic
novelist, playwright, and poet, Jens Bjorneboe (w/ a slash through the first
o).  I recommend the excellent web site on his
work--http:\\home.att.net/~emurer, which is maintained by his English
translator, Esther Murer.

Your argument would justify almost any wholesale slaughter, as in "Gosh,
those Romans are suffering" (Atilla the Hun), or, "Gee, it must be hard

Perhaps making a distinction between anarchist "aesthetics" (a
more recent development, born out of the collapse of
the anarchist movement in the 30's) and the anarchist movement
itself, with which very few poets and artists have been
involved, would be useful . . .

Anarchist aesthetics first appear in the modernist avant-garde
as images of terrorist violence and "chaos" -- quite at odds
with the anarcho-pacifism of JML, Cage, Duncan, Levertov,
Rexroth, Snyder, Ginsberg, et al.   After the horrors of
WW II, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, such images no longer
resonate the they once did.

It would seem that "post-modern" writers who have been influenced
by anarchist theory are wary of literary attempts to "master"
reality through statement (propaganda) and (technique) bomb,
favoring instead a direct attack on the reproduction of
centralized state authority in language, and cognition.  I
would suggest that the Situationists have been especially
influential in this respect (see "All the King's Men" in the new
Rothenberg/Joris anth.).

I wonder: exactly how does anarchism figure in contemporary
poetics? Watten has spoken of an "anarchy of production" in
recent poetries, and someone has also mentioned Mayer and
Coolidge.

Is this "anarchist tendency" at odds with the originally
Marxist elements of LangPo?

No, nothing of that kind was implied.

Contrary to some opinions there is hardly anyone, if anyone, who has any
significant power of command, who does not agonize about the fact of losing
even one man. It is a sense of responsibility that is hard to convey or
to explain. On the other hand if it comes down to it, sacrificing a few
for the sake of many more than were sacrificed, is also a responsibility.
Not a responsibility that can be enjoyed, but one that is necessitated.

If 20 men were in a position to cost the lives of hundreds or even thousands
of other troops, as an officer your responsibility would be to prevent that
from happening. Sometimes that means by any means necessary.

It simply is that way. The details often never make it to the media.
They only get a broad, distorted, overview.

You should keep your computer circuits away from that methyl hydrate.
It is not good to drink that stuff.....

Actually, I replied to this a moment ago. It really is not that hard to
understand. Simply that the lives of many are valued more than the lives
of the few, where both are in the same balance. That logic is simple enough.

I would agree that mistakes happen, and particularly in the complicated
psychological and technical jungle of modern warfare. I do not know if a
particular incident was a mistake in terms of there being a more viable
option or whether it was the only viable option to save the most human lives
within the context of the military action in progress.

I can only speak to the principles, not the specifics of that incident.

I was not into discussing whether the war as a whole was legitimized or not.
That is a very different debate. That is the supposed hindsight is 20/20
discourse about whether there were other options and what the outcomes might
have been. (Fact is there is no such hindsight. We are where we is because
we were where we was. That's all there is to it.)

        Anarchism continues to have a strong input in poetic, visual and
theoretical practices all over the world--
        the areas of visual poetry and mail art especially
        there are hundreds of journals, web sites, events going on which
are anarchist
        yes there are many forms of anarchism

Another point of departure for the subject of anarchy (and the supplemental role our government played in its use of chemical weapon's in Vietnam) would be the case of Elizam Escobar, painter, poet, and contributing/associate editor of the magazine Left Curve. Perhaps Manuel Brito would like to contact him.( I know his question is directed toward the 1960's poetry scene, but perhaps he could write to him and ask him if he feels like he beat his head against the wall but now is forced to let poetry do it for him? I mean who breaks down wall really,poetry(not the poet) or the anarchist? Who is full of (aka Yeats) 'passionate' intensity? The best lack all conviction? .)I can't comment on the  two poems I've read of his, but his essays and paintings(seen some on the website and in a magazine) warrant our attention. He can be reached at the Maximum Security prison in El Reno, Oklahoma, where he is serving out a 68 year prison term. Anyone know about this guy?

I have only know about Elizam Escobar #88969-024 for about one month, but I am having trouble understanding what the U.S. government's role in his arrest and incarceration is? This case seems as insidious as the use of chemical weapons on our own citizens.

====================
Quoting from a web page devoted to him:

His paintings have been exhibited in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and in more than 10 Puerto Rican cities. The paintings he created in jail are currently being exhibited throughout the United States.

His works have been published in several magazines including Beginnings and Currents. He published a series in De Pie y En Lucha and soon will finish a collection entitled The Onthological War Against the Art Market: An Act of Liberation. His works have also appeared in the Anthology of Latino Poets in New York. Some of his more recent illustrations can be found in Cuadernos de Poetica, published in the Dominican Republic. Quimera Editors published his book, Speech in the Night and Sonia Semenovena, while another article appeared in the art magazine, Left Curve.[  http://www.wco.com/~leftcurv]

Since April 4, 1980 Elizam has been serving a 68-year prison sentence, accused of seditious conspiracy. He was later accused of being a member of the Armed Forces of Puerto Rican National Liberation (FALN).
===========
Maybe Manuel Brito could get some interesting responses to the project he is working on by hooking up to these sites, which gives Elizam Escobar's address in Prison, and if you are editing a book of some kind on this subject maybe Elizam Escobar #88969-024  would contribute a piece, from the Belly of the Beast, so to speak).

Well, there is an astonishing piece on Left Curve's Website by John Berger (yes,
THE John Berger) called "Steps Toward a Small Theory of the Visible( with an
exchange of letters between the author and Elizam Escobar) which is astounding.
Trust your own judgement and see for yourself.

===========================
Here's the address for _Left Curve_...go to issue #21 to hook up to the John
Berger piece:

            http://www.wco.com/~leftcurv/lc21contentstx.html
===========================

In the magazine version of Left Curve No.21(which is apparently different from
the Website  version) Elizam Escobar has an essay which I only read part of but
he has been an attentive reader of Nietzsche and Blanchot ( whom he quotes
extensively…..Pierre Joris might be very interested in this piece).

===========

As anyone heard of Toni Negri? This from a website at _leftcurve_:

 Toni Negri, radical philosopher and activist whose writings are well- known
throughout the world, has been in prison in Rome since July 1, 1997. He has been
sentenced to more than 13 years in prison, not counting another conviction that
is now in the appeal process. After residing in France in exile since 1983, he
returned to Italy voluntarily in the hope that his action would contribute to
the resolution of the problem of the exiles and prisoners who are wanted or
convicted for the political activities of the1970s in Italy, the so-called
"years of lead." About 180 people are still in Italian prison under these
charges and about 150 are in exile, the majority of them in France.

piece. (Back channel it to me if you like)

(By the way, the 100th anniversary of Puerto Rico's invasion by the United
States is coming up this July. I suppose there will be many readings,
demonstrations, art exhibits around various U.S. cities).

Finally, a Scientific American reader with some nuts and bolts
political and ethical sense! I say that when the U.S. goes back to
the Persian Gulf  or Central America or maybe Indonesia to save the
natives from themselves it should keep Morpheal's simple formula in
mind: Use whatever it takes on hold-out villages if it will arguably
result in fewer losses to our forces and shorten unfriendly
resistance to the military action in progress. And come to think of
it, if I can add my two cents to Morpheal's sound and simple line of
argument, keep the anthrax handy too. If necessary, that will quickly
take the fight out of Charlie--not to mention any brainwashed
defectors from our side-- and could well save quite a few lives when
everything is factored in.

Of course, I'm sure Morpheal would agree with me that such
actions--particularly when we are temporary guests in another
land--must only be undertaken as a _last resort_ and be guided,
always, by the foremost of all principles-- the hypothetical
preservation of the greatest number of human lives, for human life,
as we civilized people know, is the bottom line. And I'm sure he'd
also caution that military and political leaders forced to make such
decisions in the jungle of modern warfare should realize from
the get-go that they may forever be burdened with the angst of having
possibly made a "mistake"-- as even Saddam Hussein must be burdened
by the gassing of Kurdistan, though he believes in his heart that it
was done to save many others from unnecessary death and suffering.
(Of course, the thing with the Kurds was obviously a _mistake_, and
so I _am not_ defending Saddam Hussein in any sense here. I said he
probably "believes" he saved many more lives. The man is a threat to
the world, and if we'd made the tough decision and
precision-nuked Baghdad some years ago, the planet would now be
--simple logic-- a less dangerous place.)

And the planet _is_ a complicated place R. Gancie, whoever you are,
much more complicated than you realize. So stop it, will you, with
your empty and bleeding-heart rant about nerve gas and just stick to
neutrinos or something along those lines. As Morpheal brilliantly
summed it all up, "We are where we is because we were where we was."

One of the most startling realizations of the Gulf war for me, independent of how I feel about whether that war was justified or not, was this: when nations come to the brink of war and an ultimatum is issued, it can never be a bluff. And once the war begins, it is a fight to the death of many and all civilized norms about 'fair fighting' become irrelevant in the face of the necessity to end it unequivocally and quickly. The first options considered are those that will win quickest and most decisively. The only reasons chemical or nuclear weapons might not be used in such a situation would relate to the fallout the perpetrators might suffer, not the other side, civilian or military.

This is the hellish logic of war when it happens. Defectors are traitors or have been broken and turned into weapons against the nation they are now fighting against and will be murdered as quickly as the enemy, perhaps with more sympathy than otherwise, but no less quickly, given the opportunity.

Morpheal was not arguing the moral stature of such realities, only pointing out their existence once a state of war has descended.

Hey, she's been hanking with me more than she has with Bromide. The latter
is a shy English gentleperson who has to be hit over the head before he
knows someone is coming on to him. He writes good aromatic poetry, though.

And if you are in his neighbourhood, you should snaffle a photo of him in
his famous straw hat and scan it into the net.

I was with you till you got to the word "Hanoi."

I had made the normal assumption that some young people in that theatre of
war would notice what was obvious to the rest of the world--that though
such a thing is only relative, the US was the wicked power in that war, and
the Vietnamese were defending themselves YET AGAIN against invaders from
elsewhere. It is only to be hoped that a few young people would get free of
Washington brainwashing and decide to leave the repugnant invaders. The

Now you're talking! That would justify killing John Kennedy and his

Negri wrote an interesting book with Felix Guattari called "Communists Like
Us: New Spaces of Liberty, New Lines of Alliance".  It was published in
France in 1985 & translated & published in english in 1990 by Semiotext(e)
(who also, I believe, translated & published another of Negri's books).
From the back cover of Communists Like Us: "The project: to rescue
"communism" from its own disrepute.  Once invoked as the liberation of work
through mankind's collective creation, communism has instead stifled
humanity.  We who see in communism the liberation of both collective and
individual possibilities must reverse that regimentation of thought and
desire which terminates the individual."

The book is an attempt at rethinking the political left, post-1968, a bit
romantic at times (that's prhaps why I like it) but raises interesting
possibilities - the production of subjectivity & the production of new
social alliances are the key forces for new revolutionary change (from
memory).

Negri is apparently still hanging around Paris, a friend of mine met him
there last year.  She said he didn't look at all like she'd imagine an
Italian anarchist to look like - he was immaculately groomed & wearing a
suit.  But they were going to the opera...

Roger Farr's post is interesting and forwards these issues, yet I'm
troubled because I don't see the disentangling of terms and the confusions
about "aesthetic anarchism" leading to a sense of where or how this debate
could even be framed. Thanks to Don for pointing out the west coast
branches of this "movement". Let me try to get my bearings a little on
this topic.

> Perhaps making a distinction between anarchist "aesthetics" (a

> itself, with which very few poets and artists have been

If you mean anarchism as  "popular" political force, then didn't anarchism
die out after Haymarket? Didn't it die out after the round-up of
anarchists after the assasination of McKinley at the Pan Am Expo in
Buffalo at the turn of the century? Or do you refer to the Civil War in
Spain? The suggestion that an anarchist aesthetics develops out of the
collapse of the movement is very interesting & I'd like to hear more about
this. It seems to me that anarchism gains quite a bit of momentum during
the war, when the unions and the communists capitulated to the war fever.
In fact, the anarchists pulled some of the disenfranchised lefties
(Macdonald, Goodman, among others) in that direction because their
opposition to the war led to their estrangement from publishing circles
such as the Partisan Review, etc.

It was Mac Low who introduced Goodman to the Why circle, which did meet
for years at the Lower Broadway Spanish Anarchist meeting hall. For an
interesting "account" of the later end of that time, see Judith Malina's
diary, for it was Mac Low who brought her and Julian Beck to those
meetings for the first time. Other members of that group included Moe
Moskovitz, of Moe's Books fame, and even a very young poet named Irving
Feldman, who has taught at UBuffalo for 30 some odd years. I'd be very
curious to know more about that group and the accounts I've read of the
meetings are very interesting indeed.

I don't agree that poets and artists haven't been involved in the
struggle. The list from the 20s,30s & 40s is long enough. Auden included
Dachine Rainer in his anthology and her 1948 chapbook is a very
interesting little document, which is also "forthcoming" from meow press
in the future as part of the "anarchist poets from the 1940s reprint
series." She married a man named (Scott, I think) Ballantine who was the
nephew of Emma Goldman, or the grand nephew and she is very elderly and
lives in London, I think. Before that she lived in the woodstock area with
Holley Cantine, who was killed in a fire (?) in the late forties or early
50s I'm not sure. But Dachine Rainer was a known poet at the time.
Obviously Duncan and Mac Low, who met yes at one of those meetings. Don
mentioned others, but list is longer. All of those magazines (Cantine and
Rainer edited (((AND HAND PRINTED!!)) Retort, "an anarchist quarterly".

The question is, it seems to me, how do you want to define anarchist. Do
you really want to include Thoreau? Do you want to leave him out? Do we
accept tactical responses to repressive uses of central authority, or only
strategic ones?

Roger continues:
>
> Anarchist aesthetics first appear in the modernist avant-garde
> as images of terrorist violence and "chaos" -- quite at odds
> with the anarcho-pacifism of JML, Cage, Duncan, Levertov,
> Rexroth, Snyder, Ginsberg, et al.   After the horrors of

> resonate the they once did.

Personally, I think that the "terrorist violence and 'chaos'" associated
with anarchists is an image that dates back to Haymarket and is part of
the popular mythology. Alexander Berkman did try to kill Frick but Czolgoz
(sp?) who killed McKinley was NOT an anarchist but a disturbed person who
once heard Emma Goldman speak. (btw, you can view an early Edison film of
his execution at the Library of Congress' American Memory website).
Whether Sacco and Vanzetti actually killed (i.e. murdered) anyone isn't
relavant to their association with anarchists. Whether they were framed
(if they were framed) for being anarchists, however, may be.

But is the representation of anarchists, of "bomb-throwing" and terror and
chaos, is that really what constitutes an anarchist aesthetics here? I
don't think so. Is "Guernica"? maybe. That's getting closer. Does
anarchism become simply an analogy for ones relation to the materials?
(i.e. decenterd author/reader) "groovy chaotic poetry, dude, anarchy!"
"Wild stuff! Wild wild stuff" (RIP Phil Hartman, whose impressions of Rich
Little and Ben Friedlander brought anarchist aesthetics to TV)

A double standard?

Whether Sacco and Vanzetti actually killed (i.e. murdered) anyone IS QUITE
relavant to their association with anarchists.

In fact, that particular and large group of anarchists were quite into
bomb-throwing.

You've read Avrich's "S & V: The Anarchist Background" I'm sure. Anyone
interested in S & V (making dozens of appearances in popular American poetry

Dan & other Anarcho-hysterians...

Mike Basinski's tour of the East side of Buffalo includes the house where
Leon Gzolgoz lived. (I know that's not right spelling, but no one ever
gets my name right either)

If you can get past the 500 typos in his book "High Hopes: the Rise and
Fall of Buffalo, New York", Mark Goldman tells the story of what happened
with some amount of humor. After the expo was a wash due to the hysteria
surrounding the death of the Prez, an elephant went on a rampage,
trampling some people, etc. In an effort to rejuvinate enthusiasm for the
Expo, they sold tickets to the excecution of the elephant. They wired him
up to be electrocuted (I guess everyone was pretty impressed by all the
lights and the juice flowing thru them). But when a couple shots of
electricity didn't do the job (apparently they didn't account for the
elephant's thick skin) they let the poor thing live.

I read an "oral history" once about the excecution of Leon C., which
stated that he was electrocuted and dissolved in acid and that they burned
his clothes (in public, again) in order to placate the terror of the
people. This turns out not to be true....alas...

Goldman also tells of how Irish immigrants invaded Canada from Buffalo in
an attempt to hold it hostage in order to free Ireland. People knew
something was up when suddenly 5,000 young men gathered in the old first
ward. When they rowed across the niagara, the brits were waiting for them
and they were thoroughly routed.

I'm sorry if I got the S/C thing wrong. I thought they were "framed" or
whatever for murdering people during a botched robbery. I haven't read
that book and will at some point. The syntax of my sentence there is
flawed. I guess if I am going to rob someone and kill them -- whether I'm
disturbed or not -- that has nothing to do with my friends...  I've read
also that they DID in fact kill those people and that their affiliations
were otherwise. If it wasn't in an Avrich book that I read that, I can't
remember where...

And on another note, I've been affiliated with "anarchists" at different
times in my life, and some of them were in fact quite violent. But that
seems to me to have nothing to do with the anarchism to which I subscribe.
(and my subscription is about to run out). I.e. there isn't in my mind
anything about anarchism per se which necessitates violence. But then all
those anarcho-pacifists were reading Ghandi, etc., when all that was
happening in India.

Is Timothy McVeigh an anarchist?

Remember, loose lips sink ships...

Wasn't Manuel's original question a search for info on poets connected in
some way with anarchism & dissent in the 60s?  That's a pretty specific
question.  I would think the answers would be restricted to poets involved
in anarchist or civil disobedient activity in that period, or who tried
consciously to reflect that activity in their poems or poetics.

Not to suppress discussion, just to reiterate Manuel's original query.
I hope I got it right.

            The nearest thing to an active and self-identified anarchism now
is probably the hacker community.

            The high-school hacker-cracker anarchistic scene and its funding
by web porn
is something to ponder. See, for ex., http://www.chaostic.com/. There seem to
be hundreds of these sights.  Chaostic.com has information on making bombs and
classic anarchist stuff,
suggestions for disrupting school ("piss in your pants while giving an oral
report"), pirated software, hacker software--all the guides and tools for
information-age anarchism.  It is all technique, no theory.  Resistance to
authority at its grubbiest.

        Does anyone know whether the magazine Drunken Boat, ed. Max
Blechman, "The Anarchist Magazine of Literature and the Visual Arts"
published more than two issues, or intends to? The first two were/are
wonderful. Blechman's Intro to #1 begins:

        "I'm sick of these post-modern, post-Marxist, post-structuralist
journals of literature and the arts. They're post a lot of things but
they're not post-boring."       and ends:

        "Forget Foucault, NEVER MIND Baudrillard, FUCK DERRIDA. This is the
DRUNKEN BOAT."

Last address I had was PO Box 718, NYC 10009, NY.  I should have sent
money. Maybe it's not too late--anybody know? (I would have been an
Anarchist, but I heard you had to join.) sylvester

       Well, as far as I know, the DRUNKEN BOAT was a Phila. magazine
        (Philly magazine) of the early mid 90s, and i don't know if it
       still exists. It might. I think Linh Dinh edited it?????
      Of course, there might be two, and Todd Colby's band....

I cannot agree with you. Also, that is misleadingly simple minded.

Corollary to what was already stated, another responsibility of command
is to complete the mission with as few civilian casualties as possible,
while keeping the losses among one's own and friendly forces minimized.
Any mission is a difficult mission, and that is inevitably a delicate balance.

Civilian casualties and collateral damage to infra-structures that are
not of significant strategic importance is nothing to write home about.
Those casualties of war, being innocent victims, often of fear and political
brainwashing as well as of the machinery of outright conflict, are a tragedy
in any instance. It is that that inevitably becomes most regretable as to any
conflict, even if unavoidable.

Anthrax is a deplorably horrendous means of mass destruction.

We do, however, have need to develop effective detection of chemical and
biological weapons, as well as efficient counter-measures and defences. There
is a long way to go, on that score, and in fact the battle against potential
designer viral and bacteriological agents has hardly begun. It is an arms
race, similar to that which was faced when the Soviets and America went up
against each other in the race for nuclear weapons and defences against
those weapons. It is an arms race unlike any other, because any nation might
develop such lethal and destructive means, and it is far from limited to
superpowers.

Also, it is not possible to see a biological or chemical warfare facility as
easily as we can see, via satellite, a concentration of nuclear materials
sufficient for one nuclear bomb. The latter can, in theory and practice, be
spotted and tracked with accuracy.

The other approach, rather than the development of weapons of mass
destruction, is the development of effective non-lethal weaponry. It is that
area of endeavour that shows the most promise in reducing collateral damage
and both opponent civilian and military casualties. Whether that avenue of
research can effectively put an end to war, is an interesting question. It
might be that the power that evolves that technology far enough so that it
is wholly effective, can in effect put an end to war as we have known it in
the past.

That does not mean standing down all more conventional forces and weapons,
as we never know what new threats might be suddenly poised to strike, either
from known or wholly unknown sources of aggression. As peaceful technologies
move towards more radical exploration of farther and farther from what we
are essentially familiar with a certain increased vigilance and continued
development of new means of more potent and varied defence becomes an
increasingly important concern. Certainly, I do not believe, that the human
race can relax its guard, even if the conflicts upon this planet could be
resolved peacefully, and if non lethal means of controlling and eliminating
the outbreaks of violent conflict could eventually become the normative.
While the latter is not only possible, but likely, there is no reason to
believe that we dwell in an essentially friendly space. New frontiers will
inevitably mean new species competition, and conflict. It is simply how
nature has revealed itself to be and we have no reason whatever to believe
that we are a unique instance of evolution in scenarios of conflict, within
a much vaster whole. Simple probability says that we will run up against
adversaries, somewhere in the future.

On 10 June, I offered this effusive praise for Morpheal's
eloquent defense of nerve gas as a sometimes acceptable
weapon against non-chivalrous enemies who try to brainwash young
American soldiers with nonsense about "imperialist wars of
aggression" and whatnot:

Morpheal, to my chagrin, responded:

>... Anthrax is a deplorably horrendous means of mass destruction.

OK, OK, so the plug for the bio stuff was unfeeling of me. So just
nukes to back up the sarin, OK? I mean you always hope those won't be
necessary, but if you're weighing the lives of the many against the
lives of the few, you gotta do what you gotta do.

Subject:      What it all has to do with poetry
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

For those with tight schedules and short patience, this post is broken into
three parts 1) a thinking-out-loud-reply on Morpheal's (Bob E.) comments, 2)
an example that counters his assertions, or the potential application of
such, and 3) a brief meditation on Brent Long's question "What does ANY of
this have to do with Poetics, pray tell???"

Prithee listen, and pray I do not exceed my five-per-day chances to speak.

I.
The defense by Morpheal of his defending remarks summed up:

1) the issue at hand is the "responsibility of command"
2) civilian casualties and damage to infra-structures are a) "victims" b)
"tragic" c) "inevitable" (& "unavoidable") and d) "regrettable"
3) "Anthrax is a deplorably horrendous means of mass destruction"

[does this imply that there are more acceptable "means"?]

4) a chemical arms race is a logical step towards Peace
5) superior lethal technology (& its proliferation), successive developments
of the same, and good old fashioned GI Joes will always come in handy because
        a) no one is trustworthy
        b) space aliens may have a hungry eye on us


II.

OK, for an example that Morpheal's faith in the integrity and values of the
Pentagon is a little over-optimistic (to put it politely), let's think about
what the United States orchestrated seven years ago against Iraq (with "the
responsibility of command" in mind, and the unavoidable "tragedy" of
civilian victims). This is taken from the Web Page of the International War
Crimes Tribunal United States War Crimes Against Iraq
(http://deoxy.org/wc/warcrim2.htm):

A partial list of Iraqi targets:
"electric power generation, relay and transmission; water treatment, pumping
and distribution systems and reservoirs; telephone and radio exchanges,
relay stations, towers and transmission facilities; food processing, storage
and distribution facilities and markets, infant milk formula and beverage
plants, animal vaccination facilities and irrigation sites; railroad
transportation facilities, bus depots, bridges, highway overpasses,
highways, highway repair stations, trains, buses and other public
transportation vehicles, commercial and private vehicles;  oil wells and
pumps, pipelines, refineries, oil storage tanks, gasoline filling stations
and fuel delivery tank cars and trucks, and kerosene storage tanks; sewage
treatment and disposal systems; factories engaged in civilian production,
e.g., textile and automobile assembly; and historical markers and ancient
sites."

"As a direct, intentional and foreseeable result of this destruction, tens
of thousands of people have died from dehydration, dysentery and diseases
caused by impure water, inability to obtain effective medical assistance and
debilitation from hunger, shock, cold and stress. More will die until
potable water, sanitary living conditions, adequate food supplies and other
necessities are provided. There is a high risk of epidemics of cholera,
typhoid, hepatitis and other diseases as well as starvation and malnutrition
through the summer of 1991 and until food supplies are adequate and
essential services are restored."

Does bringing this into the argument make an effective counterpoint? I'm
loath to rebut Morpheal's assertions directly (because of the faults
inherent in e-mail, mostly).


III.

"What does ANY of this have to do with Poetics, pray tell???" (Brent Long)

For the people whose lives, ethics, values, etc. are inextricably wed to
poetry, Everything.

        Thanks, Chris, but this is a different one, NYC/Brooklyn based. #1
has an interview with Allen Ginsberg entitled "Anarchism and Revolution in

Also, #2 had a good article on Holly Cantine, Dachine Rainer & Retort

I think that was supposed to read "hostility is the sincerest form of

I had a few comments to make about this, but rather than burden the list
with them I would refer you to my 5,000 page dissertation "EPIGRAPHS FOR
EPIGONES."

haven't seen the Beatty movie yet, but that Baraka line sure sounds like

of command, etc.): yup, that's it, at least on the theoretical-
strategic level, viz. "to complete the mission with as few
civilian casualties as possible, while keeping the losses among one's
own and friendly forces minimized." bingo.

        however, a quick review of the Tribunal report makes it pretty
clear how much of the Gulf War, for instance, was theoretically
feasible and how much is better explained by greed, hatred, and co.
at the local and underlying levels, not to mention various
moneyed/political factors such as the promotion of the Bush
presidency, the desire to impress upon the public a continued need
for fat pentagon spending, perpetuation of the military-industrial
complex, and so forth.

one gets the feeling that 'national security' and "mine is but to
do or die" aren't really adequate to the task of explaining why
we might need to kill thousands of civilians by deliberately
targeting, for instance, water treatment plants and factories that
produce infant formula. Nor can the expenditure of weapons
and supplies AFTER Iraq's compliance with the UN order to
withdraw from Kuwait be explained by a strategy of limited,
task-oriented engagement - .

        "For example, on March 2, 1991, [after
     U.S. 24th Division Forces engaged in a four-hour assault against
     Iraqis just west of Basra. More than 750 vehicles were destroyed,
     thousands were killed without U.S. casualties. A U.S. commander
     said, "We really waxed them." It was called a "Turkey Shoot." One
     Apache helicopter crew member yelled "Say hello to Allah" as he
     launched a laser-guided Hellfire missile."*

"What does any of this have to do with Poetics?"

        this question comes up a lot here, mebbe less recently than
        in the past. Generally when discussion involves social-political
        issues, like now, I'm inclin/d to say "everything". I don't mean
        to be chiding - as I sd, lots of people have asked this over time -
        but we need to keep in mind the degree to which our art practice
        is NOT separate from History, i.e., the present, or from our
        political practice. That doesn't mean history is all we shld be
        talking about - I guess it means that's all we're EVER talking
        about, and      this is the Poetics List only because (we hope) we talk
        about that portion of it, too, more often than not.

Dear Daniel Bouchard,

Thanks for your well thought-out and lucid response to the posts from 'morpheal' et.al., in your three -part response.

 I have been trying to come up with a response that wasn't smart-ass or sarcastic. Amen to the " What does it have to do with Poetics".

I believe (some what naively) that if more people would make the 'poetics' of (say) Robert Duncan, part of their "energy of devotion", particularly "The Truth and Life of Myth"( which takes YEARS to deal with in my opinion; we have not answered for the signature of R.D. yet) or apropos of this discussion " Man's Fulfillment in  Order and Strife" we might have a chance at this.

Chris Roess


From "Ideas of the Meaning of Form"(Robert Duncan):

"...still let the war be done and the adultery rage on, for my soul is sick with fear and contention whenever I remember the claim of mind against mind and some ass praises me because a line rimes who would despise me if he knew the meanings, and I am aroused myself toward thoughts of vengeance and triumph"


from "Man's Fulfillment in Order and Strife":

"Here, thinking of our concern for World Order and for a language of that order, and of how our ideal of such an order is always betraying to every observer an other and an other order, so that those who would liberate us from the tyranny of unconscious intent but display the tyranny of conscious intent, I would call up that flash of divine insight that is embodied in the..."(R.D.)

"We are ourselves in our unhappy state as in our happiness new revelations of meaning that change the What that is at work in that event. This is the grievous impatience and the ecstatic patience we are fired by as we apprehend in all the disorders of our personal and social life the living desire and intent at work toward new orders."(R.D.)

IMHO, the Soviets did exactly that.
Using Oswald as the Soviet programmed, lone assasin.

Of course the Soviets did not like American threats against their permanent
harbour for floating and submersible nuclear missile bases either. That
really upset them enough to want to be rid of Kennedy.

Then the efforts to defer the potential public demand for outright hostilities
as to reprisals that could result in all out war and perhaps M.A.D. at a
time when Soviet and U.S. war machines were too evenly matched.

It is a strange world we live in.....

Wanted to try and raise the issue of mythology again, this time through
a really interesting quote by Marx:

"Where does Vulcan come in as against Roberts & Co.; Jupiter, as against
the lightning rod; and Hermes as against the Credit Molitor? . . . Is
Achilles possible side by side with powder and lead? Or is the Iliad at
all
compatible with the printing press and steam press? Do not singing and
reciting and the muses necessarily go out of existence with the
appearance
of the printer's bar, and do not, therefore, the prerequisites of epic
poetry disappear?" Nevertheless, Marx went on to say that "the real
difficulty is not in grasping the idea that Greek art and epos are bound
up
with certain forms of social development. It rather lies in
understanding
why they still constitute a source of enjoyment with us, and in certain
aspects prevail as a standard and model beyond attainment."

So why IS that? (This from "A Contribution to the Critique of Political
Economy", N.Y., 1904 - (and also from an essay by one Joseph Mali,
writing of Walter Benjamin's use of myth, which he got from Vico! -
quite fascinating, even brilliant in parts, and I'd be glad to supply
the citation if anyone's interested . . .)

And now, back to "The Massacre of the Innocent Jazz" - a little-known
Florentine work . . .

And an intensely-orchestrated version of the above, of course, was
put forth as official justification for the bombings of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. It is a catchall hypothetical scenario and can be easily
construed to justify just about any war crime or to "ethically"
circumvent any international treaty designed to restrain the world
from spiralling into generalized barbarism. All one has to do is play
the numbers speculation game (as Morpheal does, in theoretical
defense of the "tactical" use of nerve gas on civilian areas) and
argue that such and such an atomic, chemical, or biological act,
however regrettable the "collateral damage," may have been necessary
to prevent "even more death." In the grip of such Strangelovian
logic, the gassing of civilians comes to be described (as in one of
Morpheal's posts) as either the most "viable" choice available to
commanders or an unfortunate "mistake."

Maybe I'm just a hopeless essentialist, but my own feeling is that
when one falls into this logic, one leaves one's humanity behind. And
thus leaves behind anything we could call poetry. I think that's
some of what Ginsberg felt and meant when he said "Go fuck
yourself with your [nerve gas] bomb."

Well I guess so, if hanking can be defined as an occasional exchange of
choleric outbursts.  But everyone knows that the most poignant POETICS
love story is the one between B & B (not that there's anything wrong
with that).  Watch your screen in the wee small hours of the morning
when these two often achieve intense lyric heights.

This is very odd.

My opinion, at the time of the Gulf War was that Iraq should be made a
United Nations protectorate. That way, not only would any subsequent buildup
and problems as to control over remaining weaponry be eliminated, but the
population of Iraq would have been assured:

1). deprogramming from the brain washing they had endured
    (not unlike denazification in post WWII Germany, but not as extreme)
2). adequate care for the wounded and the civilian population
3). protection, if necessary, from any other country taking advantage of
    a defeated neighbour (most likely Iran)
4). the end of a then Soviet region of influence
5). genuinely democratic elections when the infra-structure was restabilized

It could be done after WWII, and facilitated the rebuilding of a secure
Germany with a viable economy and a truly democratic government. So why
not in Iraq ?  I could see no reason for not doing it. Nevertheless,
those who made the decisions decided against going that far. Presumably
because of the threat of further violating potential Soviet interests and
perhaps risk to allied assets if the Iraqi capital was to be secured, as I
believe it ought to have been secured.

As you recall Iraq threatened Israel first, then attacked Kuwait.
The threat against Israeli civilian targets was quite extreme. Threats against
the Kuwaiti population were horrific, as we know from events. Of course, I do
not believe that coming to the defence of friends and allies in any way
justifies punishing the civilian population of the aggressor nation. To the
contrary, I have always maintained, and published several times on the net
in prominent places, the argument that Iraq ought to be immediately allowed
to trade as much oil as necessary for medicines and foodstuffs. That
recommendation was completely ignored, by those who presumably had other
aggendas.

Anyway, you are very misleading as to my own opinions in that matter.

In any situation, even if we respect those in command in any specific
instance, we still have the right to our own divergence of opinion. That
does not mean that we have any possibility to act upon that opinion. The
actions are decided by those who have the ultimate power to decide them.
However, sometimes our opinions do have some influence on the outcomes.
Unfortunately my opinions as to the future of Iraq did not have the positive
influence I hoped they would have, and the future there remains very dark,
for different reasons.

I certainly did not say that.

I have never condoned the use of weapons of mass destruction on
civilian targets. Never, at any time, in any situation. That includes
biological and chemical weapons, as well as nuclear.

In fact I attempted to influence, and might have had some small success
in the provision of European and American assistance to the former Soviet
republics as to the safe destruction of weapons of mass destruction. There
is now a very effective program in place providing technical assistance.

The entire purpose of bringing the Cold War to a close was to reduce the
number of such weapons, including dismantle nuclear bombs. Some of the
bombs and chemicals were becoming somewhat unstable, as well as there

a slow, meticulous process.

Anyway,....that is where I have always stood, on the frontier of argument
for the effective control and destruction of biological, chemical, and
nuclear weapons of mass destruction. How we achieve that goal, is another
question.
Some of the major proponents in the past were simply too naive to have any
real effect on it.

"An inner connection obtains between the Ars Combinatoria--the first
philosophical masterpiece of the young Leibnitz--and his political
memoranda written during his stays at Mainz and Hanover; among them is
the Memorandum on the Election of the Polish King, in which Poland's
place in the European Constellation of Powers was worked out in
quasi-mathematical fashion. Not only philosophy and theology, but also
politics was treated more geometrico. EVERYTHING THAT COULD NOT BE
EXPRESSED WITH MATHEMATICAL CERTITUDE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE OUTMODED; and
this applied especially to the idea and reality of the German Empire.
The rational and political constitution of the absolutist state, on the
other hand, the constitution of France, was seen to be in harmony with
the spirit of the age. Since 1660 political calculations had become
fashionable; thus in 1690 there was published in London a book by the
economist Sir William Petty, entitled Political Arithmetic. The method
of these political enquiries, which had become popular in England with
the Restoration, was inspired not by religion or morals, but (as might
be expected in this age of the great French and English scientists) by
mathematics and physics."---from Leibnitz and the Seventeenth-Century
Revolution by R.W. Meyer---cp

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Manuel,

There is a discussion of Mac Low's thoughts on anarchy in "The Pronouns"
(Station Hill,1979), p.74: "Since 1954 I have made many
pieces--simultaneities for voices &/or instruments,poems, plays,musical
works--which call for the active creative collaboration of performers &/or
audience. My reasons for liking this type of compostion have not changed
much since I wrote the statement quoted in "A Controversy of Poets"
(p.540--see bibliography):
"An 'anarchist' does not believe, as some wrongly have put it, in social
chaos.He or she believes in a state of society wherein there is no frozen
power structure, where all persons may make significant initiatory choices
in regard to matter affecting their own lives. In such a society coercion
is at a minimum & lethal violence practically nonexistent. Certainly there
will still be situations where coercion may have to be exercised to prevent
something worse, but as Ammon Hennacy demontrated in his life, even maniacs
with knives may sometimes be pacified without violent coercion....How
better to embody such ideas in microcosm than to create works wherein both
other human beings, their environments, & the world 'in general' (as
represented by such objectively hazardous means as random digits) are all
able to act within the general framework & set of 'rules' given by the
poet...The poet creates a situation wherein she or he invites other persons
& the world in general to be co-creators.The poet does not wish to be a
dictator but a loyal co-initiator of action within the free society of
equals which it is hoped the work will help to bring about..."

By the way, I quote part of this section in my article "The Aural Ellipsis
and the Nature of Listening in Contemporary Poetry" in the recently
published "Close Listening: Poetry and the Performed Word" edited by
Charles Bernstein (Oxford University Press) in a discussion Mac Low's
performances.

i believe drunken boat put out more than 2 issues.  they also recently
(past few years) published a "best of" anthology, i believe.

best place to get info on this and on the anarcho-tip is:


Left Bank Distribution
http://www.leftbankbooks.com

they're the largest north american distributor of anarchist and
anti-authoritarian lit (or at least that what we said when i was a
collective-member back in the day) and they have a huge catalog at
http://www.leftbankbooks.com/catalog.html.  i'm sure i saw drunken boat
stuff on there in the recent past.

while i'm thinking of it, left bank also runs a great books-to-prisoners
project that provides free books to incarcerated men and women.  when i
was working on it, we always had more requests than we could fill.  i
doubt it's changed much.  check out their home page for info if you're
inclined to dump some (tax-deductible) books and/or cash on them.

Maybe one reason is the way the Iliad & the Odyssey combine fiction and
reality.  The Greeks along with most ancient peoples took their "epos"
very seriously as the "whole story" for "everybody", but
the whole story included the utter strangeness of experience (the gods,
the giants, unknown regions of the world, fate, death, love, etc.).
So the story radiated a lot of "otherness"  & strangeness while
remaining a story (with a plot of earth & a grave for every character).
Poetry & writing still involve that sort of double thing, a momentum
into strangeness which retains or even heightens belief.  The
credible incredible.  What else IS ultimately "believable"?   It's
a powerful drug & a poison.  Plato was rightly concerned for free minds
& sane life when he outlawed the poets.  Isn't Don Delillo's
LIBRA the way it really happened?

This really must be the darkest, silliest, hour.

Now you are condoning the death of the many to save the few.

I wish I could laugh at that, but my laughter machine is broken and in for
repairs.

Perhaps something of the opposite might have been true when conflicts were
decided purely by the numbers of cannon fodder that a king, emperor, or
other semi-divinity could muster into the field. It is not quite the same
nowadays. Then we could have dropped a simple hand grenade on that cluster
of generals and nobility on that distant hilltop overlooking the English
squares parading against each other and falling like flies and put an end to
it more quickly.
The advance of technology seems to have changed that somewhat.

Sounds as if Plato was in fact a communist - marxist.

Either that, or Plato was/is a computer.....  It really does not matter which

        Jackpot! Thanks, Charles. That site seems a fantastic resource.
They have both issues I referred to, and in fact published what I was
calling #2 themselves, as Drunken Boat: Art Rebellion Anarchy ed. Max
Blechman. $6 & $12. The place sounds great, non-profit co-op, etc. Also
hold readings & events (Seattle). From a quick glance, they have a huge
catalogue.

Gas! GAS! Quick, boys! - An ecstasy of fumbling,
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling,
And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime...
Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.

In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.

If in some smothering dreams you too could pace
Behind the wagon that we flung him in,
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,
His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, -
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest
To children ardent for some desperate glory,
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est
Pro patria mori.

        --Wilfred Owen, from "Dulce Et Decorum Est" (partial)

Ah thank you Daniel Bouchard for posting this Wilfred Owen poem. Goes back a
long, long time for me (school). As it turns out I always remembered the simile
"like a devil's sick of sin," with particular interest, but couldn't remember
the name of the poem, or it's author. Owen does as much as he can here to
express inexpressible horror.

        Maybe one reason [why myths still constitute a source of
enjoyment with us, and in certain aspects prevail as a standard and
model beyond attainment] is the way the Iliad & the Odyssey combine
fiction and
        reality.  The Greeks along with most ancient peoples took their
"epos"
        very seriously as the "whole story" for "everybody", but
        the whole story included the utter strangeness of experience
(the gods,
        the giants, unknown regions of the world, fate, death, love,
etc.).
        So the story radiated a lot of "otherness"  & strangeness while
        remaining a story (with a plot of earth & a grave for every
character).
        Poetry & writing still involve that sort of double thing, a
momentum
        into strangeness which retains or even heightens belief.  The
        credible incredible.  What else IS ultimately "believable"?
It's
        a powerful drug & a poison.  Plato was rightly concerned for
free minds
        & sane life when he outlawed the poets.  Isn't Don Delillo's
        LIBRA the way it really happened?

        Which thought I applaud, not only as a response to Karl Marx's
question but as a contribution to the "What's nerve gas got to do (got
to do) with it" discussion - DeLillo's _Underworld_ continues this theme
of blending the real with the imaginary, being a "history" of the last
50 years as well as a "novel" (beginning with the Giant-Dodger game of
1951, Hoover in attendance, learning of Russian H-bomb explosion) . . .

        Brent Long's hermeticism just ain't gonna fly, and Daniel
Bouchard's Owen poem (and the work of Sassoon and others, as mentioned
yesterday) is perhaps the best response to it. But there's also this,
from an article called "The Politics of Jacques Derrida" in the current
issue of the New York Review of Books :

                "The history of French philosophy in the three decades
following the Second World War can be summed up in a phrase: politics
dictated and philosophy wrote. After the Liberation, and thanks mainly
to the example of Jean-Paul Sartre, the mantle of the Dreyfusard
intellectual passed from the writer to the philosopher, who was now
expected to pronounce on the events of the day. This development led to
a blurring of the boundaries between pure philosophical inquiry,
political philosophy, and political engagement, . . ."

        . . . which lines, he goes on to say, are slowly re-establishing
themselves. Substitute "poet" for "philosopher" here and you have a
justification for such discussion, and for such work. (This article is
TREMENDOUSLY entertaining! Equally as good as the one about the Texas
textbook massacre of a few weeks ago! It's very jaundiced about Derrida
and the entire program of "academic postmodernism" - and has instructed
me greatly . . .)

No, Brent's wrong. Even if you take the Personism defence, there's no
beauty in ignoring atrocities. I mean,aren't we supposed to be lightly
_humiliated_ by the fact that we identify with Seinfeld, those of us who
do. I don't, I feel more like George? I feel more like a Kosovan than
Muslim, too, which may account for my only beginning now to try to find
out what is happening and who profits from my not knowing about it. I
mean, Abacha dropped dead! In his sleep!

Unless of course poetry is just pretty words, in which case, scuse me
while I go paint over Homer Sappho Virgil and O'Hara. And unless we're

caste gently and let big things take care of themselves --

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I'll add my voice to Jordan--Bernadette Mayer is key here.  I talked to
her a year or so ago and she said she was writing a book on anarchy.  Has
anyone else heard anything more on that?  I take her MEMORY project as a
how-to for practicing a refusal of the dominant society (July '71).

Coming out of Rimbaud (Je suis en gre`ve) one way to anarchy is *absolute
refusal to work*.  See also his "Je m'encrapule le plus possible."  Guy
Debord and the Situationists, Paris May '68.  Greil Marcus makes the
connection from there (a little too self-celebratorily for me) to the Punk
rockers of the seventies in his _Lipstick Traces_.

Baraka "Black Dada Nihilismus" (I agree) follows this through Dada and
Surrealism and the refusal of power in the Olson/Baraka poems to each
other from early sixties time evidences this.  Spicer relevant in
this regard, especially his refusal to play the poe biz game.

Ted Berrigan's view that the poet is always doing poetry at every moment
takes the writer out of the cash nexus.  Michaux connects to Surrealism
and important beyond what Ted did with him.  Not only his work on drug
experience but also his immersion in the world of the "mentally ill" who
by definition are isolated from and other to dominant society (big
thread here connecting up with Artauld, Foucault, on and on).

Georges Perec's political involvements in La ligne generale as this leads
into his shift to OULIPO in the sixties might be of some relevance.

bp Nichol has been going through my mind in this connection, maybe for
that same singleminded commitment to only poetry, invention of all the
possible new forms.  Michael Ondaatje's _In the Skin of a Lion_ a
practical how-to manual that ties anarchism to immigration.

Has anyone mentioned Andrei Codrescu and the anarchist streak that gets
here through the Eastern Europeans, anti-authoritarianism as wild humor?

Peace,
Peter

Dear Brent. What the livin' hell are you talking about! Haven't you
heard of the mustard gas attack at Ypres in World War One. Such poets as
Sassoon, Rosenberg, Service wrote diectly or indirectly about that
horrible business. The savagery of World War I, embodied in the gas
attacks at Ypres, are immortalized, IMMORTALIZED! by Pound in the Cantos
and Mauberley as well as in Bunting's work. Pound's loss of his friend,
the sculptor, Gaudier-Brzeska, to the insanity of that war affected him
deeply for the rest of his long life. Official lying is a poetic
theme---read Pound, Ginsberg, Corso, Bly, Levertov---practically any
damn body of my generation or the generations before me. Hypocrisy is a
theme of poetry---read Martial or Catullus or et al. War is a theme of
poetry. Death is a poetic theme. How obvious! How far we drift when we
abandon meaning or wallow in the pubescent delights of a material
culture or practice an aesthetic asceticism. How clean we all feel. I
for one began hearing rumors back in the mid-seventies (around the time
of the Pike and Church sub-committee hearings) that the U.S. used sarin
gas in the Southeast Asian general theatre of operations. I live just a
few miles from Fort Detrick, MD where such things are tested. But in
spite of the foreknowledge of the likelihood of the U.S. using gas in
Southeast Asia, this most recent and concrete information has profoundly
distressed and sickened me. And to borrow from Sojourner Truth---"And
ain't I a 'poet'!?."---Carlo Parcelli

Jordan,
Dan was right, with the perfect comeback, the Owen poem.

It's always been a losing issue to try to "police" the list topics.
Because, yeah, poetry gets into everything.  But I still say Brent
was right to ask, where's the poetry in this "everything" we're
going on about?

I agree with those people who periodically ask here, hey, can we talk
about some specific poems or poets we're reading lately?  I agree with
that - that's why I've tried to contain my own meanderings...

Thank you, Henry. That was JUST what I was thinking.  Before I posted,
there was only a message from Daniel pointing out wed to poetry he
is...only problem was, there was no poetry mentioned about the topic.  NOW
we can have a conversation about poetry...finally.

The problem if there is one for poetry then isn't what subject matter is
it appropriate to discuss but:

how to make something someone anyone would want to need to read.

Cooler now I see Brent could be heard to say what is there in this about
how to make something anyone would need to read.

This is my secret (to me) problem with poetics: the only answer to that
question is the poem that does it. The question is sphinxy, automatically
better than any answer that thinks it has to do with the question.

Plato would agree with you there, Jordan, that's why he banned the poets,
because their poems were better questions than his philosophical questions
were better than the windy answers to them, which is why philosophy keeps
asking questions, to keep from being bored with their own answers, but
Plato lives in Mauritania, I think?  Therefore I am Maury? Je wha???

This is an extraordinarily muddled conversation. Nobody contests (least
of all, I would venture to say, the "hermetic" Brent Long)  That poets (like
philosophers, "writers," and people of all kinds) can and maybe even should
think about nerve gas, care about nerve gas, and maybe even, to the best of
their ability, _write_ about nerve gas-- if they hope or imagine that
writing about nerve gas might do something about nerve gas (like cause
other people or themselves to think about it or care about it or do
something about it).

The question Brent was asking-- and,as a cross aside, it strikes me that
it is the question one can KNOW he was asking just by reading it with
the tiniest presumption of goodwill-- was not, why should such a
conversation begin on a list like this
one (not, in other words, poets shouldn't talk about such things!) but
rather, why is this conversation going on and on (and on) without anyone
even trying to address the relationship
between caring about the constructive choices that (let's say)a particular
POEM enjoins (or more generally, about the nature of the choices that
POETICS as a field of inquiry takes up as its clearest subject
matter) to the various _other_ kinds of ethical and political choices people
have to make? Its a knotty question, but there are obviously ways to think
about it-- in other contexts, people _on this list_ have
thought it. It doesn't seem so far out of line (self-righteous,
hermetic, aestheticist, aescetic, formalist, elitist, careerist, or
policelike) to bring it up.

But "because I care a whole lot about x and y, x has EVERYTHING
to do with y" is not really thinking about the question, no matter how loud the
caps, no matter how aphoristic the formulation; it is a way to dismiss
the question, and I understand Brent's (irritated) refusal to take it
seriously as a good faith answer. "I developed a strong
set of moral and political beliefs while reading and thinking about and
writing poems and I can apply those beliefs to the topic of modern
warfare and to many other things" or even
"look! some poems are actually _about_ modern warfare and even about how
horrible nerve gas is," as genetic and thematic answers, don't quite
address the question fully either-- which is about the relationship
between areas of practice: again, how to think about the
conceptual relation between choices made in the making of poems and
choices of other kinds.

        Perfect.  This is the task of poetics.  Not a given poem.  The
poem needn't address the why or it, that's not its task.  The why is
engulfed by the how (to interpret, to listen) which is the fundamental
task of poetics.  The works denegrated are not being listened to, I'm
afraid.

Shakespeare study turns into exam tragedy


            LONDON (Reuters) - British students found to their horror
they had spent two years studying the wrong play when their exam
paper had no questions on Shakespeare's epic tragedy ``King
Lear.''
            Bradford Grammar School, whose former pupils include painter
David Hockney and former Labour minister Denis Healey,
discovered its curriculum error and hastily rang the examination
board.
            A teacher mistakenly taught the pupils ``King Lear'' instead
of three other Shakespeare plays which were on the syllabus.
Headmaster Stephen Davidson said the teacher was ``absolutely
devastated.''
            A spokesman for the examination board said: ``It will have
been a stressful time for the students and we will do everything
we can to make sure that they are not disadvantaged by a mistake
that wasn't their fault.''
            Staff and pupils are anxiously awaiting the results from the
A-level examination, which can affect pupils' chances of gaining
entrance to universities.

I guess now's a good time to repeat that POETRY MAKES NOTHING HAPPEN! Poetry
makes poetry happen, keeps us sane, dignified, and civil-like in bad times, and
buoys or transcends even our best times. It is an inertial wheel that keeps
experiences/memories/thought/language, everything, good and bad, alive. Poetry
makes something happen but in the "radiant and productive atmosphere" of the
mundo of the imagination. "There was so much that was real, that was not
real"--the world is upside down, circular. What is too real, hyper-real (the
horrible) becomes unreal compared with the "normal," the things as they are,
no?

Do paint over Homer, Sappho, Virgil, and O'Hara, but with words--it's all we've
ever been doing since in this palimpsestuous relationship we have with the
past.

The problem if it is one (don't think it is) is that there isn't one poetry
(subject matter excluded).

"to need"--not gonna do it, not gonna do it. What is that phrase "all the news
fit to print(?) or something like that.

teb berrigan was on the job full time
as are most of us. We don't get paid for the hours
we spend writing, or dreaming up ways into writing.
And who thinks of cash when they're deep inside a poem?
Did that insurance guy from Hartford look up
from his angular handwriting and see dollar signs
in the air?

OK, in some sense I'm on  the job of being a poet full time when I'm making
book works. And when I'm washing dishes at home. And when I'm taking my
children to guitar lessons. And when I'm picking up masonite at the
lumberyard for my wife so she can include painting on masonite in her class
at the Tucson Museum of Art. And when I'm thinking of cash because I don't
have any. And when I'm thinking of insurance because my children sure do
get sick often enough.  But maybe not on the job as poet any moreso than
someone else who does similar 'extra' things who is a carpenter is always
on the job as carpenter; or someone else is always on the job as biologist,
etc. etc.  I don't really think poets are any more 'special' people than
anybody else, although I do like the way a lot of them think . . . and
write. What was the Olson line?  " poet  /  get a joboosky!"

<<  POETRY MAKES NOTHING HAPPEN!

If poetry makes nothing happen but more poetry then does it become a mechanism
for control.  People write, publish, read, comment on it and thereby acquire
some kind of cultural capital (Bourdieu would call it distinction) that allows
them to become relatively satisfied and therefore prevents them from making
things happen in regard to economic capital.

At the same time, poetry in relation to say Hollywood is in a domintated
position which perpetuates the frustration and animosity of poets who then
express their animosity (however beautifully and joyously) by writing about
pop culture...politics...etc?

I think it was said that it keeps us "civil-like".

I get a little nervous with the suggestion that poetry returns us to the
imagination, to the mind or the prison house of language.

      I would say not-I here I'd say _The Book Of Knots_
                            (Michael Palmer: Letters to Zanzotto)


      Friends too tired to see differences,
This, Marx dissociated:
"Equal right..presupposes inequality,
Different people are not equal one to another."
But to make the exploitation by one man of many
                                                                                 impossible!
When the opposition between brain and manual work
                                                           will have disappeared,

When labor will have ceased to be a mere means of
                                                                             supporting life,

       Whether it was 'impossible for matter to think?'
                  Duns Scotus posed.
       Unbodily substance is an absurdity
                  like unbodily body. It is impossible
       to separate thought and matter that thinks.
                                                        (Louis Zukofsky,: [A-8])




Although the horizon of (Mallarme's)_ Un Coup de des_ is not that of technology---its vocabulary is still the vocabulary of symbolism, grounded on the anima mundi and on the universal correspondence---the space it opens is the same as that faced by technology: world without image, reality without world and infinitely real. MARX is frequently accused, not always with reason, of aesthetic blindness; but this does not prevent one of his observations from being an extraordinarily accurate forecast of the contemporary  poet's situation: the modern world is "a society that develops by excluding any mythological relation with nature, relation that is expressed by means of myths, and then presupposes in the artist an imagination independent of mythology…" (p254)


The imagination free of any world image---a mythology is nothing else---turns back on itself and sets up its abode out in the cold, as it were: a now and a here with-out anyone. Unlike the poets of the past, Mallarme does not offer us a vision of the world: nor does he say one word to us about what it means or does not mean to be a man…our legacy is not Mallarme's word but the space opened by his word.(Ibid)


Mallarme's method, creative destruction or transposition, but above all surrealism, destroyed forever the idea of the poet as an exceptional being. Surrealism did not deny inspiration, an exceptional state: it affirmed that it was common property. Poetry requires no special talent but rather a kind of spiritual daring, an unbinding that is also an un-winding.(254-255)

                                                                                (Octavio Paz: _The Bow a                                                                                                                       and the Lyre_)

 A poetics is informed and informs-
Just 'informs' maybe-the rest a risk.
                                                       L.Z. :[A-12]

Maybe we've got the wrong thing here, but my boss and I think it's On Bread and

was published in 1977 by Grey Fox Press, Bolinas (isbn 0-912516-27-5). Nice
little book. We have it here in the archives at the Ginsberg Library if the
friend is ever in Boulder :-)

Anyone else come up with anything closer? If so, I'd love to know. Did Richard
Brautigan get into Zen? I know he spent some time in Japan and was fascinated
with things Japanese... but I didn't think he was the religious sort. Then again,
some of the first parts of the Bible I read were in Brautigan poems.

Generally those who think about it most seriously, I'd hazard; anyhow, if
in following pudding here's a prooflet:

giddy at the tilt of a negative crystal.
The toy is childish, almost below speech

so hard to know as it is to do:
wresting the screen before the eyelet lost
to speech tune you blame the victim.
Pity me!  These petals, crimson and pink,

of soft azure.  At the last we want
unit costs plus VAT, patient grading:
made to order, made to care, poised
at the nub of avid sugar soap.

RICHARD BRAUTIGAN'S LAST DAY IN MONTANA

I saw his death in Rolling Stone - the typeset memorial,
the photo of a straw-haired man
tapping a Remington for the prose of love.
Brautigan loved Japan, and like Yukio Mishima's, his art
involved a marriage of ink and blood -
no great poetry comes without a taste of death.

The day he left his life with a loud report,
the deer moved off into the shapes of trees
and the Great Owl unsheathed its daggers.
From the simplest work the darkest work emerges.
He left a handgun rusting in the grass, his fingers
unfolding like the stamens of a starnge blue flower,
his life's work bleeding away
for hours in the cold Montana rain.

If convenient, check out the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley.  It's got a
spectacular collection of everything in the world including Brautigan
hard-to-finds and Beat stuff.  It's also an archive library and is open to
the public.  Down side--can't check things out, but it's the neatest thing
around, I tell ya.

Someone whose name MIGHT be Oren Izenberg says:

Well, let's hear it for "muddled," I say -- I frankly can't remember a
day when this List wasn't. For example, Jordan says the only real answer
to the question is the poem itself, and Patrick answers him and says
"exactly! It's not a given poem." I mean . . . what could possibly be
more muddled than that? As a poet no one on this list has mentioned in
the last two years (with some reason) once wrote:

        Misunderstanding. Misunderstanding, misunderstanding.
                                                (John Berryman)
Oren goes on to say:

>
Ah . . . so there IS a condition that poets must meet before they can
write about nerve gas -- they must "hope or imagine that writing about
nerve gas might do something about nerve gas" -- in other words, they
should have some political agenda at stake when they mention certain
objects or images, and not just want to rhyme "nerve gas" with "rat's
ass".

As much as I believe in the poetic decision to mingle fact and fiction,
history and myth, as much as I believe that poetry does other things
besides "survive in the valley of its saying," this admonition seems . .
. limiting. And arises, I think, from a basic misconception that I
explore below. But first, more Oren:

I'll say! Also muddled! Can we accept Jordan's formulation of it
instead?

        What is there in this (topic of nerve gas)
        about how to make something
        anyone would need to read?

I would say first that this question, implying as it does a separation
between what's called "poetry" and what's called "politics," could not
even be formulated in other cultures, where poets were and (in some
cases) still are recognized as truth-tellers. It would be, for example,
unrecognizable to Central European and Latin American poets of a certain
time. Most North American poets have no conception of what it means to
live in a society where every word they wrote had the potential to
become part of their own death-sentence. And that's probably a good
thing!

We read that most people are "turned off" by politics these days, that
most of us feel no connection with government or our elected leaders or
the decisions that are made in our name. Such cynicism is
understandable. But surely what fueled the indignation of the
respondents to Brent (including me) was the suggestion that poetics --
the occasion for this list -- has NOTHING to do with the revelation that
our government was guilty of monstrous acts and keeping them secret.
Poets are makers (look it up), and the words we use to make our poems
have histories and roots and blood and guts -- they have implications,
connotations. Poetry IS history IS politics just as a rose is a rose is
a rose, and we shouldn't confuse the luxury of being insulated from such
knowledge with an actual intellectual position. And I'm not talking
about propaganda or pamphlets, either (although god bless Jack
Hirshman!).

        In addition to the poets that have been cited in this thread
(Carlo, I think you got everyone!), I'd mention one more prose-writer,
Milan Kundera -- especially his _Book of Laughter and Forgetting_, which
deals with these matters rather more eloquently and poignantly.

        And because this is such a long post and because it's my 2nd of
the day, I won't quote more of the NYRB's "The Politics of Jacques
Derrida" here -- but would love to hear other reactions to it!

Yeah, know the line, but my point is (sigh) that the writing
of poetry is not concommitant with making money. AFTER it's
been written? There are some who do make a quid, sure, but
do they write with cash in mind? That's not what Mr Stevens
was on about.

Maybe I'm off here but....

Don't poetry professors get raises and promotions when they publish books
with "respectable" presses?

And don't they get raises if they win awards etc?

Or if they edit something?

Don't people who win first-book contests get money (like, $500-$5000)?

I know some younger poets who will only submit work to magazines that
pay... (I know this sounds crazy.... it has something to do with what they
perceive as a heightened prestige...).

Yes, they are important. Don't forget:

                        1). nerve gases
                        2). other chemical warfare agents
                            (toxins, mutagens, carcinogens, for attacking
                             people and foodstuffs)
                        3). psi weapons (including some EMR and RF type stuff)
                        4). bacteriological weapons
                        5). viral weapons
                        6). other biological weapons
                        7). nuclear weapons
                        8). microwave and laser type weapons

Did I forget any major categories ?

A government shopping list. Which government ? Could be any of them.
Or maybe a despotic dictator's request to Santa Claus and his elves.

Poetry is noticably absent from their wish lists.
That is one of the reasons that I keep on writing it.
Poetry seems so very sane, in comparison with international politics.

I wonder, however, would poets make reasonably good diplomats ?

disagree heartily with don byrd that the online hackers are the only
visible presence these days.  the scene around anarchy magazine, zerzan,
feral faun etc has been going for years, the writings of hakim bey,
particularly TAZ has situated numerous autonomous zone infoshops around
the states, many in their own enclave, but yearly anarchist gatherings
bring em together.  at dreamtime I would guesstimate that more than half
of the folks coming thru here over the years is from some sort of
anarchist orientation, whether punk, queer, animal rights, intellectual
or art/noise.

I must speak here and not lurk.  Mostly I write responses, sit on them and
then trash them because they seem superceded or supercilous.  What I most
enjoy here is the tangetial discussions such as those on the poetics of
anarchy or January's slugfest on vizpoetics.   What most disturbs me are Yahoo
pronouncements about war, or technology, or political Anarchism. I suppose the
initial effect arises from my own nature, which values speculation over
assertion and poetics over polemics.

I try not to dismiss wholesale Morpheal's posts, and in trying to read them I
have only one mode of accomodation.  Morpheal in his best manifestations is a
poetic terrorist, introducing a topic and then mastering and remastering the
spin of it - always, you will note, a topic at least once removed from the
presumptive expertise and focus of this list.  The trope is always
'morpheatic,' moving in the direction of M's own mastery of the topic, the
alpha and omega of this petite discursive universe.  (The root 'morph'
referring to form and its shaping and to sleep, especially narcotic.)

I find him: patriarchal, dogmatic, declarative, unsubstantiated, and in
general substituting authoritative diction for real thinking.  (Maybe the core
of this is the distinction between doxa, or opinion, and sophia, wisdom, that
I recall from Plato).  This ugly lumber in the support of shapeless sentences
in distinction to what I think of (perhaps my limit here) as poetic
speculation: the latter is balanced on a regard for language itself, between
what we speak of and how we speak it.

An icky chestnut: "Those that speak don't know, those that know do not speak."
seductive tho, fulfilling our paranoid needs...

I teach in an art school which has always cherished political engagement and
its absolute relevance to 'art.'  One of the areas I often see fall short is
when an esteemed painter, poet or composer comes to visit and inevitably
someone asks a fine question, say on Bosnia or the Rodney King Uprising.  The
artist, feeling compelled to fulfill his role of wise man, makes an
authoritative pronouncement of Deeper Meaning, most often layered in received
wisdom and rhetoric.  (Rather than, say, pointing toward the thoughts of
someone who has devoted him or herself to just this topic)  I see two errors
here: the 'great man' mythology (of course a great artist would have a
profound political opinion...); and the egotism of success, the correlate to
being a great man.

The other component is our cultural penchant for paranoia (to wit, the evil of
Islamic fundamentalism against the goodwill of Western capitalism).  It is
much preferable to believe a hyperbolic and hence simple theory of the
conspiracy behind some event and its horizon.  To follow a classic line of
reasoning, balancing doxa against doxa to find wisdom, seems to exhaust
everyone.  Hence also the X-files, which endlessly defer the outline of the
grand conspiracy -- a way to leverage their discursive power and clothe their

A question:  is there a poetics of paranoia?  who are its practitioners?  Do
they lapse into the politics of paranoia or articulate a distinction to it?

Katy,

you're right on all counts, but does the actual writing process involve
"the mind lying by its accounts, and considering?"

At a festival in Sydney, when I was 18 or 19, I attended a discussion
on little magazines. I got up and said that I didn't care whether
I was paid or not, as long as I got published. I was shouted down
by poets who insisted they be paid like any other kind of worker.
They were right. I wanted so desperately to see my poems in print.
Some magazines pay well with cash, others with copies of the magazine.
In Australia, the majority of magazines pay contributors. It ain't much,
but it helps. Are there people on this discussion list who accept
copies of a magazine in lieu of cash? Who accept publication only?
Who publishes only in magazines that pay a lot? Hands up.

Nick Piombino' quoting Jackson MacLow on his erformance pieces reminds me
of the 11th Sound Poetry festival in Toronto lo these many years ago when a
summation of sound poets gathered on stage to perform _21 Matched
Asymmetries_ -- my first experience of such. Then and now my response is
wow. But exactly as he argues, they all participated by joining in
individual decisions to sound as a whole but not as 'one' ordered that way.
They chose. & boy did they chant...

I require an upfront prepub payment of $1000-5000. depending on circulation,
plus royalties on each issue sold & guarantee of book tour & promo material
(1st class air on all travel); the poems must be in unique handset font
(to distinguish from other contributors) and either 1st or last in the
table of contents; all fan mail must be directed to me by fax and
I insist on a tropical bird feather of my own choosing for each poem
which I am collecting in my cap.  Unfortunately I haven't been able to
publish much (anything, actually) so all this is negotiable.

Lets face it, money helps pay bills,
but poetry as well as music  in all reality (unless you are Jewel 1.7 million
for her book of poems) will not pay up-
who the hell makes enough off poetry without having to take a professorly job
where as Katy says the prof's get payed for publishing/publicity (business)-

poetry is a business, when it becomes a ways and a means of staying alive-

What about music, alot more high profile than poetry so more image is involved
manipulated and the buying and selling aspect is easier



You have to watch it because the moment something you do (that you love)
becomes part of the grocery bill its gonna change-

Look at the paying magazines for poetry,  the major reviews, if you tailor
your work to it then you start to mold to that magazines style to get PAID-
When someone writes you a check for your contribution and you realize it could
happen again, then you have to play into the editor's agenda- "as a poet" that
does not encourage experimentations or growing--just read those mags ...

The Rolling Stones keep putting out the same record because it pays-
Some of the older Jazz guys tour huge places for green and they have been
boring for years-
Some Poets --who have not changed in 20 years  stay that way because it sells,
that is the "high profile poetry," and is the type of poetry people figure is
"poetry"
not Jack Spicer
who gets patronized in an article by some academic bore who obviouslynever
read Spicer, only the biography (hats off to Killian and Co.)!!anyways

Money is good, but every artist/musican /poets I knew and respected had
another job to pay rent that is not bad-

Some magazines can not afford to pay poets, but those poets will see their
work in print and in good company-



-what is bad is expecting money for poetry to equal prestige-

agreed--as "music"-does it "make something happen"?
or as Zukofsky "Poetry is dervied from everyday life...real or ideal.."

--getting slightly off anarch subjects;  but not entirely...

Having to have money (and therefore acknowledging that it has a presence;
in the work, in living) is not the same as full insertion into the cash
nexus.

I'm working on an essay on this interesting and diverting topic.

Essentially, poetry by dint of its "marginal" place in contemporary
culture (esp'y in the US) gets less funding than most art-activities.
This is altered in an interesting way, by the far-right success in
withdrawing public art funding...But it remains true.  Much "funding for
the arts" of course involves capitalist marketing: how most musicians make
a living.  Whether mediated by the capitalist marketplace or by the
capitalist state, the flow of money into art-activities makes it possible
to find time to work, and to create a space relatively free from overall
societal abrasions.  Poetry in large part escapes this situation.

Poetry is not defined as having obvious "value" because of the immediacy
of performance (like both art- and pop-musics); nor is it useful as a form
of rarity that may be traded as a stock-market type counter for investment
gambling, like painting and all forms of unique visual art-object, which
have become so very important as investment-games for the wealthy.

Poetry simply has next to no exchange-value, in the contemporary world.

The siting of mainstream work in the academy allowed just enough cash-flow
to support some teaching jobs, and a few grants.  This is the tenuous
thread from which a little poetry (the weakest, artistically) dangles.  If
women historically have been slaves of the slaves, the more interesting
poetries are on the margins of the margin (as defined by the shapes
created thru the intertwining of culcha' and capital).

This means poetry is less "free" as an activity, and has absolute freedom
(it doesn't haul blocks of stone for the pharoh's pyramid, but at the same
time the pharoh's government gives it no bread so it can stay alive). This
absolute freedom from commodification means that some poets (Hugh
McDiarmid say)  will work as welders in shipyards...Others (like Berrigan)
will refuse to consider non-poetry work, and pay a different sort of
price. But no one "wants" their work, as want is defined in a market
culture.  This is radical freedom in a near-vaccuum.

Thus poetry is less "enslaved" as an activity, and is absolutely enslaved.
Its unique relation to words (and thus ideas and thus politix, and
politics' violent connection to human happiness) melds with its uniquely
decommodified status in history, to give it an interesting fluidity and
an intense fire.

To create what Perelman calls "social location" is what poets outside
academe and the workshops are usually trying to do:  social location
refers not to the content of the work, but to the context of the working.
Where is the poet ( and poetry) "sited"?  Delivery systems interest poets
as much as meters; they are a part of the work.  (thus the attention given
activities like poetry slams etc.  Terrible dreck, in fact.  But in one
sense aware of what the right questions are, if not the right answers...)

Chuckle.

Bluntly stated: nice trigger happy gunshot at my metaphorical head.

You are such a warlike fellow. The trouble is that it is not the likes of
yourself, with your quick trigger finger, that is recruited from among
poeticians, but instead the most pacifist. Whenever there is a real
conflict, it is the most pacifist, (once inclusive of Whitman, but subject
to some conversion during the process of that induction), who are recruited
to be of such service.

However, I will reply to two specifics.

1). Morpheal is similar to what can and is morphed.
    The artistic, virtual morphing, becomes the model for a more
    engineered, more scientific, morphing. Eventually there is no distinction
    between virtual and real. Then it it is all real.

    The morphology, of morphing, is morpheal in exactly the sense that you
    imply. That is, of sleep, or of narcotic. It is an ultimate form of "maya"
    created to supplement 'bread and circuses', as much as for any other more
    technical and often more violent purpose.

    I did not come to sing its praises, or to bury it.

    I simply came to state a fact: that the world is becoming more morpheal,
    more morphed, more a morpheality, than any other prophet ever predicted.
    You seem to honour Morpheal in the traditional way a prophet used to be
    honoured. <grin>

2). You have misrepresented the nature of the paranoia that you refer to.

    You have expressed it in the above paragraph.

    There is an ever growing 'paranoia' as to seeing the actual conflicts
    as conflicts, and sometimes as irresolvable conflicts between certain
    instances of ideology. You mention one example of that. There are at
    least a few others. This is the same as the very prevalent arguments
    as to the Soviets being your friends, and America is the real enemy.
    Those who urged that kind of thinking urged that it was paranoia to
    see any reds under our beds. So, of course, the 'red menace' was a
    fictional creation, created by Hollywood and CIA collaboration.

    The recognition of the ultimate conspiracy that there is no conspiracy
as       the ultimate instance of paranoia. <Laughing like a Bodhisattva.>

>A question:  is there a poetics of paranoia?  who are its practitioners?  Do
>they lapse into the politics of paranoia or articulate a distinction to it?

I think Ginsberg was a wonderful paranoid.

Though I do not share some of his beliefs or predilections I certainly have
the highest respect for his work.

We definitely need more paranoids.
There are fewer than there used to be.

Paranoids at least make people think about the otherwise unthinkable.

That is the best preventative as to totalitarianism and totalism.
A kind of ex-lax for the human psyche.

Ever hear Donovan's wonderful song "Intergalactic Laxative" on his
Cosmic Wheels recording ?  I have a similar kind of feeling about this
as he expressed in that.

Oh. My. Gawd. . . . just received Sheila's _Many Wishbones_  . . . & on first
reading, wow, well, it's just the best chapbook I've read in a long, long time
. . . here's a section, later in the book:

Suddenly, no daffodils. Merely a stone
You place your finger on to take it
Miles, you place your hand around
Its substance. There you are,

Surrounded by imprudent rearrangements
You have made to match a kind of indigence
Perhaps insufferable to the diligent new worker
Who imagines time's a corollary to sure bounty.

The ray guns of generosity bombard
The self-contained who only murmur
Gratitude as learned response.
The mind struggling with nouns

Does not lose clarity about relationships.
A need for things
To have been malleable at least once
Fades. For there to have been reason.

Sheila, how did you get to this place, find yourself in the situation where
this writing is possible? Your work, which has become increasingly eroticized,
or sensualized, or whatever term all them hipster academics are toting from
conference to conference . . . now begins to incorporate or weave in, well,
dang:

As a killjoy why not patch the jacket
With your dimly lit etherea.
So your selfishness becomes a recitation. . . .

I mean, do you even REALIZE, Sheila, what the mouth & lips do, how they feel,
sounding this out? And this is invective! Yow!

This one, I mean, this is almost painful to read, here . . . & I boggle at the
situation that gave rise to it . . . how did you get something so damning to
*sit* there like that, not completely still, but like a slowly breathing
gargoyle?:

Blasphemy is swaddled in emancipative clothes.
Night emerges from submersion.
Gentry casts a pall.
Libido housed among the faithful wolves.

Don't tire me with your nuggets on a string against my neck.
Is that Apollinaire you're reading somewhat nattily?
I guess not, is the proper phrase.
This had to be America stretched to the point of ending

What we have left of an interpretation.
_Know thyself_.
Have you permitted children to be imitators of your friends,
Of you yourself.

With intimacy so taken for granted,
Many wishbones choose to snap
Beyond the point umbilical.
Beyond the enclave labeled past behavior, present life, and future mending.

This section following one in which you say: "For something to mean/ Anything
it would have/ Not to be an object" . . . you seem concentrated in this series
on the dual resonance of language . . . how it feels, how what it means feels .
. .

Sheila, mah butt is sore from where this new series of yours has been keekin'
it . . . relentlessly . . . all morning! . . . and, I'm sorry if being effusive
like this is embarrassing for you. . . but, WOW, what am I supposed to do? Read
this stuff & just sit here, turd-like, nodding my head, goin' "yeah . . . sure
. . . okay . . ." -- I mean, sorry, no way . . . I'm totally thrilled by this .
. . hummallah hummallah . . . peoples, you gotta git this book, MAQUETTE PRESS,
3 South Street, Sheepwash, Beaworth, Devon, EX21 5LZ, U.K. . . 2.50 pounds . .
. (six bucks, USA?) . . . anyway . . . okay . . . I'm totally embarrassed now .

Newton's contributions considerably furthered the science of "ballistics".
Predictable regularity as to falling bodies meant being on target.

What is interesting is not as much Newtonian science, but rather Newton's
copious expositions on biblical Revelations. Any contention that Newton
did not have a strong desire to preach would be in error. Any contention
that Newton did not feel that he was a privileged initiate into occult
knowledge and secret traditions, is also likely to be as wrong.

Poetry returns us to the real--did not suggest otherwise--but it is ingenuous,
or even naive to think that it ultimately does otherwise than engage the
imagination, the mind, or language. We will find that things "real," things as
they are, or may be, did not exist for us where we thought to find them. It is
not in consensus. The social, relativistic body of the world makes an
affectation of the mind and spirit that is not real, but rather an artifice for
survival. My feet are in "this world" though: I love a broken glass poem as
much as the next person.

Count me behind bars then. You're there too running a tin cup across the bars
in protest. So's comrade Kristeva--whistling in the dark.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that quite a number of people make
a living off of poetry (poetry professors--both practitioners and critics;
people who work for poetry foundations, editors etc...). There is an
economy that goes along with poetry....

There is also a very yukky underbelly that goes along with this: the
large numbers of recent MFA graduates who are $10,000, $20,000 and even
$30,000 in debt because of their degrees.

The fact that so many 25-year-olds seem to be beginning their poetry
"careers" in such debt is disconcerting to say the least . In order to get
out of debt such young poets have to get serious jobs that really pay.

I've heard that there used to be a time when younger poets could "study"
with older poets for free.

If Mark Prejnar's right & poetry is not a commodity (I think he's right)
this casts all po-biz in a strange light; but poetry itself is so rare
& unusual (in my opinion) that when it shows up it casts politics too in a
strange light of its own, as well as criticism, etc.  Not that it's
"above" everything - it's just unusual; these people who demand pay for
their work like other "workers" - I doubt it's even poetry as I understand
it.  Poetry casts an energy of its own which is highly political and
makes things happen both in the mind and in culture in general; the
poet's style is a function of deeply political motivations, conscious
& subconscious; the project of poetry goes more and more into poetry
but there's no culture at all without some kind of shared consciousness
or mass opinion or mass development in confrontation with global
circumstances; the artist listens to the crowd & takes the crowd's
pulse on a profound level, while pursuing private & individual
impulses of craft, self-knowledge, truth... this is how it seems
to me anyway on both a "serious" & a "playful" plane... the poet is
a politician in love with words for their own sake... - Henry G

Matias -

great post - you should chime in more often. I think you're dead on re:
Morpheal's soporific blowhardism. Tom Mandel was right - where's the bozo
filter when you need one?

Just a friendly warning to all. Next week begins the 4-week long Naropa
Summer Writing Program. I hope to post some thumbnail reports of the
readings as I did last summer. Here's a partial list of poets and writers
who will be descending on Boulder: Alice Notley, Doug Oliver, the Berrigan
boys, Bev Dahlen, Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Michael
Heller, Jenny Penberthy, Carl Rakosi, Barbara Guest, Lawrence Ferlinghetti,
Elizabeth Willis, Peter Gizzi, Maureen Owen, Eleni Sikelianos, Cole Swensen,
Harryette Mullen, Eileen Myles, Joanne Kyger, Victor Cruz and my wife,
Barbara Wilder.

A general question to the List - why the hell doesn't someone publish a Jack
Collom Selected Poems? Among many grievous oversights in the world of poetry
publishing, this is one of the worst.

I try not to dismiss wholesale Morpheal's posts, and in trying to read them
I
have only one mode of accomodation.  Morpheal in his best manifestations is
a
poetic terrorist, introducing a topic and then mastering and remastering the
spin of it - always, you will note, a topic at least once removed from the
presumptive expertise and focus of this list.  The trope is always
'morpheatic,' moving in the direction of M's own mastery of the topic, the
alpha and omega of this petite discursive universe.  (The root 'morph'
referring to form and its shaping and to sleep, especially narcotic.)

I find him: patriarchal, dogmatic, declarative, unsubstantiated, and in
general substituting authoritative diction for real thinking.  (Maybe the
core
of this is the distinction between doxa, or opinion, and sophia, wisdom,
that
I recall from Plato).  This ugly lumber in the support of shapeless
sentences
in distinction to what I think of (perhaps my limit here) as poetic
speculation: the latter is balanced on a regard for language itself, between
what we speak of and how we speak it.

Just to put this into the mash on anarchy: that Robert Duncan identified
himself rather profoundly with anarchism--in fact there was a friendship
between him and Jackson Mac Low, which you might think perhaps an
unlikely connection--based on this.

Here is a brief poem of my own from a "deck" of poems abusing Rachel

Hi Katy & All,

I've been following the stuff on the list regarding poets and the ways
that they do/don't make money.

So, there might be money in poetry, but it doesn't seem to be coming my
way.  Most of us poets probably feel this way.

So--the stock market? Yesterday, a grad student and a computer science professor
from Berkeley who have created a web browser opened their stock on the
market at $16.  It closed at $40.

Part of me--the poor poet part--feels like I need to just learn to be
stock-market savvy and get in on the money.  The other part of me--the
"can't sell out" poet in me--feels like there is something not quite
right about poets who play stocks.

Anybody out there play stocks?  If so, do you feel like poetry should not
be involved in this sort of "capitalist" aspect of our culture?

Summi

P.S.  Sorry this message sounds so much like a "dear Abby" but my concerns
are genuine.

Interesting post, Summi.  I don't personally play stocks, but might say
that they and poetry do not have a direct connection to one another (unless
you are damn good at stocks and can therefore finance your own
publication/promotion).

However, I do think that your question poses other interesting points to
ponder.  It seems to me (from observing the few people I know who are
making a living at their craft) that much of the success can be attributed
to being at the right place at the right time, as well as to who you know,
in addition to being adequate in skill.  (Sounds alot like the stock market
to me.)

Perhaps the thing to do is to amass a fortune in the market, use your power
to influence famous writers, and then capitalize on that friendship.
Rememeber, there are no set "rules" for fair play in the world of money
(and if you have paid any attention to the posts of the past few weeks
here, not in the world of Poetics either.)


In jest,

Brent

         hi katie--
           "to be (professional) or not to (be) professional,
            that is the question"
             hey, have you ever read that WORDSWORTH section
               near the end of the prelude where he writes
                so eloquently (which is a kind of comedy)
                about how he met his patron, or his first patron,
                 (baby's first patron),and how he got money--
                 it's, of course, "unrealistic"
                  yet no more than any poem or movie--
                 anyway, it fascinates (or haunts) me...
                 (this reading suggestion is going to cost
                   you 100 flowers--
                     though it's be best if you waited
                         till after pollen season)...
         anyway, i am with you in rockville
            ("one day he gives us gold the next day stones"
                     timon of athens)
         but be glad you got the rent deal you got
               and a job upon arrival
                (maybe you can keep that cash nexus at bay
                   and pray that i win the slam
                    i mean pass that job interview next week
             --  it's not a moral objection to the stock market
                  nor to moshing for that matter
                   .........
                  (i like the sheila murphy stuff too
                    thanks for your effusiveness gary....)

I'm a little baffled by all this concern about money and poetry which strikes
me as a bit superficial.

First of all, anyone who hopes to make a living knows that poetry is not the
most efficacious way to do this.  People who go into the literary field hoping
to make a living probably, in a sociological analysis, would prove to belong
to group with inherited cultural capital (say the children of academics for
who education is extremely important).  These people then go get their
degrees, their book deals, tenure, etc., in order to main the relative
positions of dominance they are born into.

Another way to say this is that artists (no matter what their political
orientation) are belong to a dominated fraction of the dominant
class...dependent on those who have economic capital.

The social function of art whether we like it or not is very likely to be one
of creating distinction to those for whom economic distinction is not so
important (the rich who have it already, and the poor who don't expect to have
it).  Aren't these people in their various writing programs just trading their
economic capital for cultural capital?  Katy has already shown how those who
expect to get paid see it as a mark of legitimacy.

Third, there is a very strong connection between poetry and stocks.  In the
past it has been called ideology (althusser), then disciplinary (foucault's
discourse), lately it has been called "control society" by Virilo, Deleuze.
Whatever the name or form, the effect is an interiorized schemata which
contains the the thoughts, perceptions, and actions available to a
culture...and only these actions.  (Bourdieu's habitus, somewhat like
Chomsky's generative grammar).

Poetry and stocks:  one thing I know about people who profess an interest in
the America avant-garde is they get very uncomfortable when it is drawn to
their attention how much inherited, economic capital is behind the people with
the most cultural captial (degrees, publications, academic positions, presses)
in the comunity, many of whom are the biggest pontificators about
politics/poetry/language-- I can think of at least five big guns who have
never had to work for a living...three of which have their own presses.  These
people, of course, use their money and their prestige to define good taste
(and it tacitly accepted by those excluded from legitimate culture).

Challenges to artistic conventions could very easily be seen as struggles for
legitimacy among members of groups.  My hunch is that these challenges almost
never reveal the relations, struggles behind the notions of art (the degree to
which taste is dictated by those with the most economic and cultural capital).
Even when they speak about these relations, there is a tendency to ironize
them in such a fashion as to make the issue highly ambiguous.  They simple
oppose a dominated culture to a dominant one creating a cultural avant-garde
which by its very existence contributes to the discourse on legitimacy.

Well, those are my thoughts today.  Anyone who can show me a way of
this...well, I'd gladly appreciate it.

        Katy, sure, and that provisional term, career, has me wondering.
I tend to subscribe to the notion that poet=scholar, but at the same time
doubt whether academic=scholar.  Whether there is what could even remotely
be construed as a career in poetry would seem to depend upon a much more
vital question being raised and then jettisoned on this very list, under
the rubric of "Anarchy" and "Marx & Myth", etc.

        See Laughlin & Pound?  I beleive what these cats were up to was a
great deal different than the MFA scene we have today, not that you need
to be told that.  It's too easy to construe academic or weekend poetasters
as swindlers.  It makes sense that much of that thouroughly dis-engaged
verse should come with a certain price tag.  It's entertainment fer
chrissakes!  It makes just as much sense that really vital work comes from
the peripheries, where, f*ck it all, it will be written and disseminated
despite the careerist trappings of "the writer".

well, I studied with older poets for free (unless you count a few
sixpacks of pepsi and boxes of donuts) not so long ago and, assuming the
older poets have the time, I suspect it is still possible.  of course, I
didn't do it in beautiful Iowa City, and I have friends who studied with
the same older poets who did have to pay (or the GI bill paid or
something like that), but they got to live in Iowa City and meet Marvin
and Donald along with the poets they wanted to study with.

Aside:  I seem to recall, from what I believe was a reading of
        Ted Berrigan's first book of poems, that he felt that
        being a poet simply was not one of the options offered
        by American society to an American man.

        The book was full of interesting clues as to what made
        him say that.

        As far as I could tell the legitimate options were
        limited to soldier, businessman or factory worker.

I just wanted to clarify something....

I think that teaching is a terrific thing to do.... teachers are terrific....

And I don't think that it necessarily sullies a writer's work if he or she
teaches (either politically or aesthetically)....

I just wish that people were thinking a little harder about what's
happening vis-a-vis the plethora of first-book prizes... (the fact that
younger poets are paying out the ears so that the occassional big press
will publish a first book)... and about the debts that are being accrued
by younger writers who, perhaps, can't figure out any other way to find a
writing community or the time to write...

Best,
Katy

Sometimes I say no to magazines or anthologies that promise money, and

To me the company of other writers is the main point.

Oh yeah! Now I remember. But also Bowen did play Ornette in the late
fifties, and he was the first disk jockey I remember doing that. Also he
and Frank Davey were the first 2 people I heard of who had an MG6.
So when people laugh at the idea of the New Orleans Jazz moving to SLC and
keeping their name, I remember Bowen.

Aren't such sociological analyses skewed when "hoping to make a living"
is a synonym for "wishful thinking based on supposed literary talent"?
I mean, these "children of academics" sound like abstractions. NOBODY hopes
to make a living at it without foolish ambition & literary dreams of glory.
Maybe I'm wrong but I can't believe it is EVER a matter of some kind of
social calculation.  Am I being naive again?

But why bother to call that art?  That's the primary mistake of this kind of
"analysis".  It's not poetry you're talking about.  I mean why dignify it with
the name?

Is this the poetry of sociology?  The control of control.  Bites its own tail.

This seems true & only increases the mystery around the question : where's

Check out the bozo filters on Netscape 4 (which by the way is free for

It's easy as pie and you can pick your own bozos.  Highly recommended,

That sigh is very telling Anthony.

I hope you=27re right otherwise I will be ditching those theories =
suggesting art informs, leads, and offers new perceptions as opposed to =
reinforcing existing hegemonies.

As an editor of an eclectic literary magazine - a little thing struggling =
to survive from year to year - it has been years since Ive not paid for a =
poem, though at ten dollars a pop this is mere tokenism. A response =
recently by a young poet is typical, she writes, as for payment, this is =
hardly an issue to be raised by poets these days - we=27d all stop writing =
if we were thinking it is for ten dollars.=20

It is somewhat different with articles and essays. If you cast your net =
wide enough sometimes you can trawl an embarrassment of riches: material =
so good you think, I cannot do this justice with my limited circulation =
and offer of payment, probably it has only come to me because the writer =
is not au fait with existing publishing networks anyway. This is where the =
tokenism becomes even more apparent, when you are capable of offering only =
twenty to fifty dollars for a piece of writing, knowing they could get =
three hundred for it somewhere else. Its painful. On at least one occasion =
I have taken work elsewhere, to a magazine with a far wider distribution =
(where incidentally the value of the piece was reaffirmed for me), to be =
met with, youre the lucky editor, you should use it: a kind response since =
I know the interest was genuine. But generally, surviving on a shoestring =
you struggle so hard for good material that the last thing on your mind is =
to give it away, you can rarely afford to be that generous.=20

Sometimes though, a little goodwill results in an occasional windfall =
(read: exciting manuscript) in the mail, or a ready response when youre =
seeking comment on an issue ... and its gratis. Or at least, affordable.

Goodwill can surface in other ways too. Some writers for instance, given a =
book to review,  come up consistently with work of such quality youd think =
they were submitting it to the most prestigious and most highly paying =
outlets in the land. (God you treasure such individuals). They simply care =
a good deal about their craft and subject matter and dont know any other =
way to write but to give it their best. Money? ... is a long way down =
their scale of priorities.=20

I am no poet. But the care and priority for craftsmanship that I see =
elsewhere, in other forms, isnt too far removed from the poet deep inside =
the poem, is it?

By the way, my apologies for the absence of apostrophes but they=27ve =
given me trouble in this forum before.

Best,

Ralph

who are the "people" who you wish were thinking harder (= younger
poets?  contest administrators? etc).  You are obviously thinking
harder, putting a lot of energy into creating a print community -- is
it that you wish that this alternative forum (small press, which
offers no such incentives as book prizes, etc.) was in some sense
more legitimate in the eyes of your peers? In other words, is this
(in part) a generational problem?  Or, extending that, do you wish
that we could construct a whole other (non-academic) forum to
study "free"?

Thanks Patrick Durgin -- I did read it twice!  The first time very
critical of Standard Schaefer's generalizations -- it works "in theory" -- but
in "reality"? The second time agreeing with it all in theory. please,
allow me to explain:

> They simple oppose a dominated culture to a dominant one creating a
> cultural avant-garde which by its very existence contributes to the
> discourse on legitimacy.

> Well, those are my thoughts today.  Anyone who can show me a way of

the way out is through the door -- i mean there is no way out in this
Derridean bind Standard points out.  I'm assuming that since he wants
to be shown the door he sees the "legitimizing system" as a problem.
But I wonder to what extent it's an intellectual problem *only* -- an
"artificial" problem (well, the whole system is artificial) "created"
via  theorizing it as a problem?  If people can access economic
and social alternatives in what ever communities they tap into for
support, then this seems to me to be an intellectual (and therefore
ethical?) problem.

> Aren't these people in their various writing programs just trading their

or rather, "investing" -- because they still come out with economic
capital. But, in "reality", a lot of people trade econimic capital
for shit (though anything can be construed as cultural capital)
or to meet Bill Knott who's an amazing poet and teacher but who
doesn't have a lot of (current) cultural capital. (Is his performative
cultural capital -- it only grants me capital when I claim it & only
to a certain community? No -- All captial is performative, hence the
resume.  I'm just arguing with myself here -- don't really have an
answer)
.
People trade or invest econ capital with or in writing programs
for lots of reasons.  Always, community -- whether
to have people around the seethe enviously when you win the prize, or
to maybe hang out and talk poetry -- well that depends on a number of
factors and especially what values the institution puts
forth in its choice of faculty & students, how it awards funding, what
sorts of pedagogy & dialogue it constructs, etc

I'm sounding like an advocate for writing programs, but actually I'm
not.   I don't think there's a one out there that doesn't think
primarily about the bottom line. I'd much rather have camped out on
Bill Knott's lawn, if he'd chosen to surround himself with such luxury.

still, the way out is through the door.  The question is, which door?
and do we need some new doors?  regardless of how complicit they are
in the system of legitimacy since we seem to have no choice.

thanks for hearing me out.

Summi

A couple of years ago I worked for a media monitoring company & my job was
to compile & edit all the info in the Australian press on the oil, gas &
mining industries.  I had no previous knowledge of the area but after about
six months knew what was going on in the industry pretty well.  I was
seriously going to get into the market as I figured that I knew all this
info so I even did a stock market course at the Aust Stock Market.

The only trouble was, knowing how the industry works & how the market
works, could I really invest my money in a company that I knew was dumping
crap into a river of papua new guinea & destroying peoples lives
downstream, or a company that's signing deals in developing countries that
mean they have no environmental responsibility for control or clean up?
the examples go on ... Oil, mining & gas is a good industry to make a lot
of money in but there's an enormous amount of shady business goes on,
particularly Western companies in developing countries.

Perhaps the best way to get into the market is to pretend that it's just
money & you're making it & people aren't involved.  But in the end they
are.  I never really had enough money to get into the market anyway & quit
the job over not getting paid on time.

This wouldn't have been free, but I would've paid to be in Berryman's

Esp. Henry,

I don't quite see how you arrived at the statement "why bother to
call that poetry"--as in, just because someone accepts money for their
poetry--or is concerned with such things--does this necessarily disqualify
it as art?

Does poetry have its own special rules? What about painters and fiction
writers who sell their art? Is the work of F Scott Fitzgerald un- or
anti-artistic because he thought so much about money? Fitzgerald conceived
of The Great Gatsby as his "canonical" work.... when it was panned by the
critics, he was devastated....

Is Stein's work worse for the fact that she could afford to spurn the
academy and the critics (due to her independent wealth)? Or Better?

Is Dickinson's?

It would seem that Berrigan's financial state buttressed his aesthetic
aims--did Eliot's?

Crane?

I think it's too easy to simply dismiss work by people who are concerned
with money and/or prestige....

Best,
Katy

Interesting.....and there is always the danger of a totalitarianism of one
kind or another. Paranoia is sometimes the antithesis of that. Poets
sometimes stretch some of the limits. That is sometimes their value. They
sometimes struggle to keep the boundaries of what can be thought and
communicated  expanding rather than contracting, within the domain of
language. They also  strive to maintain the place of emotive expression,
when it is besieged by
calculative mentalities. That is quite important.

Though I doubt that you would find that human survival is ultimately achieved
in the way that you suggest. Dissent has been an important part of human
survival. A very important part of it.

I really don't have much pity for those who choose to rack up the debt at
Iowa. I had one year of possible teaching writing to law students at Iowa
with no promise for the second year, or a solid one year comp, one year
poetry writing teaching deal at Irvine with a 2/3 fee reduction.  Guess
where I went?  Sure, I had a prof say, pay whatever, get the loans, go to
Iowa.  I decided otherwise for the financial reason as well as for who I
wanted to study with and the crit theory at Irvine. Great poetry study does
not necessarily--or even usually--equal great debt.  Can't figure out any
other way to find a writing community?  I don't buy it.

I don't think anyone should enter an MFA program in poetry to prepare for
any kind of moneymaking job.  Period.

Absolutely not.  Bourdieu is actually most specific and if you read his books
you will see that he spells out with many actual naive statements by various
people who are not abstractions...it would also be clear how it does not
require any social calculation...that happens to be why I mentioned

Is anyone under the illusion that it's only "younger writers" who carry a
great deal of debt; this is true even of many poets I know who have found a
writing community, and it's certainly not only true of poets and artists in
our current economy. And it has nothing to do with somehow losing their
money by giving it toward first book prizes. It's more a fact of their
existing on extremely small incomes, sometimes with growing families, yet
continuing to make it a priority to 'buy' (with what? is sometimes a
question) time for writing.

While growing up in America (mostly in Oklahoma) I certainly never
encountered the possibility that one might actually be a poet. I would
think that if one grew up with a strong sense that it was an option in
American society, that would be quite unusual. I think in my family the
options were more like: teacher, soldier, businessman, laborer, clerical
worker, administrator, and perhaps a few others, possibly even writer, but
definitely not poet.

Henry as usual is quite acute, however it strikes me that to  counter
Standard's skepticism about the ideological dimension of poetry with merely an
assertion of the "mystery" of art & (here I'm putting words in his mouth) its
capacity to transcend institutional/cultural contradictions is not really an
adequate response.  Moreover, aligning Bourdieu, as Henry does, with the
academy is a cheap shot given B's consistent criticism of the French academic
system in works such as _Homo Academius_,  and  his long association with the
marginalized Ecole des hautes Etudes.  What, Standard is asking, are the
social conditions of poetry?  It's a question worth addressing I think, before
dismissing it. There is, I've found, a tendency in this venue for people to
become somewhat sanctimonious about art.  & I'm afraid this is reflected in
alot of the new poetry I see -- Ron Silliman's criticism a few months back
about the prevalence of the abstract lyric seems to me, in hindsight, quite
legitimate -- it is numbingly ubiquitous. To what extent does it conspire with
the taste of those with the most cultural/economic capital? -- even if,
granted, it is in a form that they would not immediately recognize. As much as
I've enjoyed the spate of new anthologies in the last several months, I also
find myself asking if there is a connection between the diversity of poetries
presented in most of these collections -- take for example the recent New
(American) Poets antholgy --  & the politically neutralizing pluralism of
contemporary American culture?

I wonder if I'm just totally out of the loop here: the only mag that's ever paid
me is Sulfur, and that was 35$ per poem. For a grand total of less than $150. I
understand that the Bay Area where I live is expensive, but I can't believe that
anyone really thinks that 35 bucks is going to makea dramatic difference to their
personal economy. Particularly if they have children. Does anyone really believe
they could live off literary magazine payments?

Are we assuming that people with stock inherited it? Again I'm out of the loop,
perhaps. Can one not be a legitimate poet if one inherits stock? How about those
of us who purchase our own stock? Or are we not allowed to, if we want to be
poets? Aren't all of these boundaries a little silly? I always thought the cool
thing about art was I could do what I like.

Is there a burgeoning suburban-mentality of poetics? A suburb that uses Marx to
look down on the Joneses? The problem isn't that the neighbors have better
things...we can look down on them for having immoral things. Like money or
professorships.

I think Bowering is sincere when he says he'd sooner write poetry than get
money, because decades ago I offered him a stipend to stop writing, and he
kept the first instalment & went on writing anyway. Natch, I sent no
further instalments, & with maturity I am glad we let the matter drop. But
I would like that CAN$500 back. I need US$300 to send to an editor.  David

"In a pervasive change of the cultural mind in the seventeenth century,
a complex descriptive model was substituted for nature, so something in
the model corresponded to everything in nature. The model was a formal
system or linguistic machine--in contemporary jargon, a computer
program. It was assumed that the world consists of a few types of simple
objects--atoms of some kind, some limited and enumerable set of simple
things, that can be represented by linguistic tokens--and a finite set
of specifiable rules by which these tokens can be combined. Thus, the
rules can be applied to the tokens; and linguistic models of the world,
corresponding point by point to the physical world, can be created. "To
understand a phenomenon," thus means "to be able to construct a
corresponding linguistic machine." Of course, if the model corresponds
precisely to the original, it is not clear what has been gained. The
locus of the object is changed. Humans seem to feel that the model,
being a "human thing," as it were, is more understandable than the world
itself."---from The Poetics of the Common Knowledge by Don Byrd

"The essential idea is very simple. Inside all hadrons are smaller
particles called quarks. The rules say that they are permitted to stick
together in one of two possible ways, either in trios or in

particles, and these are called baryons, meaning the 'heavier ones'. The
best known baryons are the neutorn and proton........."---from

kidding around, lapping up the delights of conversation, coming into work
early on a Saturday morning, unlocking the poetics list with the jangling
keys of doubt, curiosity, hope, confusion, bubbling over with love and
affections for everyone on the list, drunkenly waking up to find that I
didn't have enough money to buy a beer, living off the generosity of
friends, wondering how I am going to move across the country, wondering if
there is a border scene with Mexican poets in TJ Mex, hoping that I can
make it, realizing that my full time job doesn't pay anything, realizing
that I'd do it anyway, half-serious sticking stamps on 50 catalogs to send
to richie-rich patrons and libraries, hoping that I can sell enough books
to make up for th 90% of them that I give away, realzing that the kindness
of friends outweighs any sense of terror that the economic system is going
to crush me under its boots, crunch crunch crunch

STOP THE RAT RACE NOW!

I always loved that story about Bob Creeley visiting the Zukofskys and
him leaving with a coat and a dime for the subway. recently he mentioned
to me with a quizzed look how when he "was young" (tho RC seems
perpetually young to me) that he and his cohorts never considered the
sense of having a "career" as a poet. Just that they never used that word.
And I think now I need to understand what does that mean. A careerist is
bad. Yes?/No? (choose one). But 'having a career' (as opposed to a "life")
seems to be an assumption based on some vision of the conditions
of necessity, and to question that seems to put you automatically in this
badass camp and it raises the hackles of those who have invested their
good fortunes in graduate school, etc., and now want the payback owed to
them for their hard work. This is an argument that happens annually around
here--the grad school as "gift economy" (you do it for love, for the
purity of the intellect yayaya) and grad school as training factory (must
write on Melville and [insert current idea here] -- must not be creative)
The argument that people are owed something by this system has always
amused. But as I watch my friends get chewed up and spit out & as I watch
the saw blade spinning and notice that I have been tied down & there is no
superhero coming to rescue me, I shake my head hoping to wake up.

I suppose we are what we eat and why shouldn't the wall-street logic of
the newspapers runover the average poet stumbling into an MFA program,
looking for "community" (of all things) a good time and a job. Personally
I would like a filter for such thinking. Bruce Andrews once described the
buffalo poetics program to me as problematic because it gave young people
the opportunity to obtain power and prestige (??) without having to do
time in a community. I have spent a lot of time thinking about
this statement and is provocative stance. Sometimes I used it to
tame whever hopes and expectations that may develop from being
around here. Every year people show up here with this on their
minds, how are they are going to get something for themselves. And I'm
working (slowly) on a novel about this place, which is framed by a murder
mystery. This sense that people are owed something...I dunnoo..I learned
to type by memorizing the Tao te Ching back in 82 or so (in high school)
and the notion of wu-wei as expressed by JML and such thinkers is not a
foreign idea to me...and seems a better description of how to live in the
world than Derrida (whom I enjoy as much as the next PBJ sandwish being
served up on the grad platter)

 Obviously Bruce doesn't know about the rather high
placement rate of the program (compared to the rest of the department).
When he said that, which was during the Apex of the M crisis, when
everyone in New York thought there was some kind of religious revival
sweeping across the Niagara Frontier. For all their problematic ideas, at
least they were in the bizness to stir things up. Lew is now at Union
Theological (gone Horse and Buggy as someone recently said to me)
Alan is doing honest work, as is Kristin, and I'm assuming Pam is too. But
none of them are trying to make money as poets or poet-instigators.
Bruce's comment hit me like a pile of bricks and recently I asked him
about this comment, which he had forgotten. But in the absence of any real
economic reward it seems to me (ob via) that you just simply have to want
to do it and that will win out over everything. Even much of the rhetoric
surrounding conceptions of community seem to be screens for watered-down
ways of thinking about this relation to power and authority. Show me a
community and I'll show you a scene...

But what, finally, does it mean to have a career as a poet? What is the
goal? In this dispersed networked economy, what constitutes "community"
when the fact of literary centers has been reduced for decentralization
and global expansion. Surely all these poet-teachers are not going to be
teaching in New York and S.F.

If all of this is simply about finding a job, well then I think we've seen
what that adds up to. Take a walk around the halls of your local English
Dept sometime soon. obviously, you gotta work. Lately I've been working
fulltime as an editor and a book-designer, assembler. But there is no
money in this.  I sent out an appeal to the list & two  people
replied. Thanks. That will keep the printers going for that much longer.
Scott Pound gave me some beautiful new color covers for the newest meow
press books. Charles Alexander's, Noemie Maxwell's, and Denise Newman's.
They're lovely. Thank god for Scott's generosity. My organizational skills
are improving. I can't pay people but I can give the author copies of the
book to sell, give away, etc. Of a run of 200, I can give 50 to the
author. It takes me a while to make all of them so I tend to be a little
behind. The summer has given me the opportunity to work every day on this
project and sometime in July I'll be "all caught up" with those
commitments to authors and people have ordered books. I wish I could do
more for people who labor writing.  I may stop giving books away and move
to a "subscription" system similar to the victorian era system in which
the guarantee of interest in support for specific books will them happen.
Why whould I want to print 1000 copies of a book that finally 100 people
care about. Why would I want to let Norton, or whomever, pulp my book
because of unfortunate tax laws which make it cheaper to destroy the
extant copies of a book, rendering it outofprint, rather than keep it
around another year?

Sorry to go on at such length. I'm feeling emotional as all of this talk
of money and how to survive and still do your work and you want to stay
busy and you want to be honest and free and believe without cynicism that
the gift is real and not tied to power and prestige as seems to be the
default logic of people who get paid to knock other people down.

Hi Linda,

As per your questions:

The first re: putting out a small press magazine/ small presses....

One thing I've learned while doing EXPLOSIVE is that no literary magazine
has that large of a circulation--particularly magazines that feature
poetry only.

Right now I'm producing 300 copies of each issue of EXPLOSIVE--I give some
away, sell others, and get some subscriptions. At first I thought this was
a joke--300....

But after researching a little bit noticed that even the most prestigious
magazines (many of which feature prose and fiction as well) weren't
exactly flooding the world (The New Yorker aside...). The Paris Review,
for example (if the CCLMP guide is correct) does a circulation of
12,000--and this with an incredible world-wide distribution network, a
gazillion libraries subscribing, and all the prestige in the world--

In other words, I don't think the small press scene is really that small
when compared with the "big press" scene--in all scenes it's terrific if a
book sells 1000 copies....

As far as book prizes... I'm just shocked at how little attention is paid
to this particular phenomenon. An interesting example: The Yale Prize last
year... 700 younger poets applied, shelling out $15 a piece.... that adds
up to about $10,500 that went to Yale University Press (a small press like
Atelos could put out 6 books for this price...). Merwin decided that no
manuscript deserved the prize that year.... and Yale U Press kept the
money.

I'm not so sure what's happening to this money--whether book prizes
finally make money for the press that sponsors them, or simply pay for the
price of the book and the publicity for the prize--

This is not to say that first-book prizes or evil or a totally bad
deal. They do guarantee that some first books will be published--and
published nicely... but in the end it is the contestants who are paying
for the book... not the press or the judge.

Finally, this is not to say that I haven't entered my share of book
contests... or gone through my MFA program.... or submitted work to
perfect-bound magazines...

I guess I'm just trying to say that (perhaps most members of this
community aside) there is certainly a market for prestige in poetry....
and it's certainly taking its toll on very young writers in the form of
actual cash...

Another thing: I find it strange that so many posts to this thread seem to
generalize about "MFA students".... or about what it means to be part of a
community of writers...

These days it's hard to find a "scene" or a "community" that's not
comprised of a lot of people with MFAs (just take a look at the new
Talisman anthol of younger writers...). To just dismiss this
phenomenon.... or to ridicule or otherwise laugh at people who might
enroll in a program (whether they're looking for jobs in poetry or
not... some people aren't.... some people just don't know what else to do)
is facile at best.

I don't know the quote off-hand, but Pound once said something along the
lines of "it doesn't matter who writes the great poems as long as they are
written...". I have to admit that I get tired of the conflation of art and
life insofar as it excludes or denounces the work of people who might
conduct their "real" lives in an ethically questionable manner.

Some of the posts to this thread seem to be saying "well, if you're not
tough enough to do it on your own, then you're not a real poet...". I
think this is crap.

I also think that there is a romanticization going on here of the
poet-as-cowboy model. Personally, esp. if I have children, I don't want
to be going over to someone's house and getting a coat and a dime for the
subway.

Best,
Katy

What a lot of interesting messages on this subject!  Katy, Standard, Jacques,
Joel:
Katy - I can imagine a poet with a hell of a lot of talent and smarts who
knows how good they are & moves like a tactician into all the money &
prestige enclaves there are; actually I can imagine a lot of poets
approaching this level.  What I meant by saying "why call it poetry?"
is that that prudent, ambitious, acquisitve, aggressive energy is not
the poetry: I agreed with Mark P. that poetry's basically not a commodity
and those acquisitive or practical drives pose a threat to: 1) creative
freedom, and 2) poetry's strongest hand - the truth-telling it can do
from the outside.  I agree with Jacques that the flip side of this is
sanctimonious self-righteousness & complacent subculturism, and I agreed
(in my first response) with Standard: "counter-cultures" become mirror
images (sometimes) of economic elites. But I did not take a cheap shot
at Bourdieu or the academy or sociology - they are too strong for cheap
shots.  Their social analyses can be all-encompassing: that's what I meant
by "the control of control".  I don't dismiss Schaefer's points at all -
I just think there are limits to critical rationalism when it comes to
understanding the synthetic coherences of art & poetry.  Ultimately I
agree completely with Joel Kuszai's point that it's a "gift" you have
to take on its own terms.  This does not cancel out a critical-political
analysis of the author's background or the poem's genesis; but what I
worry about is the dismissal of the work based on a rational-critical
Sorbonnean "explanation".  As Augustine put it in Latin: you must believe
in order to understand.  Belief is prior to understanding.  This is a
threatening paradox to rationalism, but it underlies the learning
process; it underlies receptivity to a work of art; and it's a
theological tradition very basic to the development of universities
in the first place. Sociological explanations easily become blinders
which slot the politically-correct from the incorrect. Katy, you
might accuse me of similar blinders based on the "gift" position:
but my response is the same to you as to Jacques & Standard:
I find it simply impossible to write or read poetry with "career"
in mind.  The receptive/productive synapses close down; the
intellectual process is stifled. Maybe this is just my problem.
It doesn't mean I don't get excited to get published, or stand
on tenterhooks (is that what you do with tenterhooks?) if a
publisher is reading my stuff; it doesn't mean I haven't thought
about self-publishing & done it, or felt sorry for my poems &
myself, the poems in the folder getting older; it doesn't mean I
haven't tried to figure out my limitations or where my stuff might
find a reading; I'm subject more than most maybe to ego-trips;
but I consider all those concerns & worries to be in my right hand.
I'm a left-handed poet.  You're not supposed to let your right hand
know what your left hand do.  - Henry Gould

Karen Kelly:

Thanks much for responding.  I fear though that you may not have seen my post
in context of a previous one where someone was taking a stab at "poets who
play the stock market."

In a message dated 98-06-13 08:18:30 EDT, you write:

<<
 Are we assuming that people with stock inherited it? Again I'm out of the
loop,
 perhaps. Can one not be a legitimate poet if one inherits stock? How about
those
 of us who purchase our own stock? Or are we not allowed to, if we want to be
 poets? Aren't all of these boundaries a little silly? I always thought the
cool
 thing about art was I could do what I like.
  >>

People who acquire their own fortunes are just stuck in the cultural game like
everyone else.  Frankly, one of the most sinister things about capitalism is
that if you refuse to play (or cannot play) in any regard, you are left
without much of an existence...not just diminished status, but a lack of
housing. The result is that it makes people responsible for things that they
are not.  You're no responsible for being born into a system that requires
capital of some sort to exist.

Hi Erik,

I didn't mean to trivialize the Creeley story... for Creeley this sounds
like a terrific thing. I think that I just get frustrated with some of the
life-style models that are put out there (and Creeley, being the wonderful
Creeley that he is, is a powerful role-model for me.)

As far as the "some don't know what else to do" comment--

I think that people have many different reasons for entering an MFA
program. In many ways I entered mine because I wasn't ready to be
finished with school. Some people here are definitley thinking that this
MFA will get them a job--and it does get some people some pretty good
jobs. But other people seem to have entered this particular program
because they just didn't really know what else to do. They got in, got
some form of aid (maybe teaching rhetoric or something--or a fellowship)
and just came. It wasn't something they necessarily thought out fully.

In other words, everyone is different, and to generalize about MFA
students just doesn't really do the trick for me.

I do think, though, that it's possible to generalize a little more about
the programs themselves. As someone put it, they tend to focus on the
bottom line. This is not to say that some of the teachers in these
programs aren't really cool and helpful, but rather that they are in some
sense forced into the usual positions viz administrations and such.

Best,
Katy

I saw Creeley tell a story at University at Buffalo like a year ago and his
comments on Zukofsky were so nice and heartfelt I knew that he was
really engaged with the man/ and the text.

You know what makes me sick Katy....
people who act as if university is bad...as if a continuing of an education is
a bad idea, but you will find those comments flying our of people's mouths who
have always had the opportunity  to go to school , financial or other wise

when i quit the Post Office in Buffalo after working there a while they gave
me a huge cake and every guy and lady there who was a vet and who worked there
since Vietnam patted me on the back and said "do good in school" it was the
only job I worked where the people made  me a farewell cake, but people in
Buffalo are just really nice anyways..didn't realize that until now

MFA is not bad at all, i don't think, and it is a good way to work out ideas
with other writers..the only problem comes back to money
you think this country would value writers etc and people who decide to learn
more should do it for themselves...My grandmother immigrated here and never
went far in school  it was hard to be an immigrant in buffalo even though it
was a big city back then it was divided as it is now.. but she thinks it is
great that i went to college, it is a huge deal to people who never have had
the luck to get there.

The value is in the inner growth , it is such a shame though that it costs so
much to get a graduate degree..and at times the profs know only the world of
academica and that makes it even harder to shell out cash to get "taught" by
people who
seem to value only their "status" in the world of  university.

cheerio

the kids in the opposite houses are doing a shouting match and banging pots
and pans to the sound of the thunder and rain here in albany...I am in the
middle
a pickle!

Carrie Etter said, "I don't think anyone should enter an MFA program in
poetry to prepare for any kind of moneymaking job.  Period."

it strikes me as naive that one would insist, after undergrad degrees,
exploration into grad programs, and time spent working outside of academia
(of which 90% of us have had the pleasure), that education would still be
thought of in terms of "job training." As if IGA were looking for a VP of
Poetry (not that most companies couldn't use one).

We should be paid handsomely for our work. but if money denotes cultural
value and the jury is corporate media, it's better to be paid in ...
corporate media, i would suspect, is not where we get our legitimacy now,
so why look to it to affirm one's right to eat healthfully and sleep in a
dry place? Do what you can stand to get by, and spend your own time doing
what you can to make what you think is necessary.

what we do for food and shelter is what we must do for food and shelter.
It's society that should provide for us, as we, in our poetic work provide
society. This is no pithy comment. I demand to exist in a world that sees
production and worth not in terms of profit percentages, but in terms of
the  societal/cultural contributions of its members.

if we are to _assume_ that, as poets, capitalist market forces will provide
us with our food and shelter, it seems to me that one's cheek has joind the
hook. If the societal value of art is measured by its worth in dollars, not
by its reflect/interact/meditat/ruminat/etc.../ion--CONTENT re: "the
present" or "the time in which one writes," we should all shrivel up.

Since leaving college, I've been thinking about how one can continue to
contain a larger vision of one's existence as poet and human, outside the
realm of academia. "what do you do?" such a question invariably leads folks
to give their job title or occupation. but this is not what we do.

When i met Erica hunt (at the time, i believe working for NYC Urban Dev or
the like) she said, "So are you a poet?" not "so are you a student?" which
would have been the obvious question since we were on campus and i was the
requisite age and type.

Education is a job-not job training. The real work, and one's practical
value comes in applying what you've got/studied to the society yer in (get
out and make stuff "right"). One's line of work doesn't necessarily
constitute what one "is." But one's way of thinking just might.

now, here comes "community." it's a thorny word and Joel Kuszai, in his
post earlier today, notes its complexity well. His mention of Br. Andrew's
describing "the buffalo poetics program" "as problematic because it gave
young people the opportunity to obtain power and prestige (??) without
having to do time in a community," is truth contained in truth. Power and
prestige? Most people outside the "community" of actively engaged writers
think of Buffalo as a cold snowy place. no more no less.

Power and prestige. In the eyes of interviewers at MLA, maybe. It seems to
me that for the rest of the world (that is, the greater "community," or
society) it's what you put in, not what you get--power/prestige--that
actually makes a difference.

That was a wonderful post by Joel Kuszai. Lots of good ones on
the topic of poetry and community in relation to money and publishing
and careers. I just wanted to say that I purchased _Poet Be Like God_
a few days back and am well into it and it's an amazing book (though
I wish it had more photographs!). And the book has *very much* to say
about the whole matter of "poetry vis a vis money," inasmuch as
Spicer's poetry is, arguably, what it is because of his
ultra-principled and conscientious (some would say paranoiac and
self-righteous) opposition to the "market" and "career" aspects of
the literary scene. The book is also very much about the
personal risks involved in such absolute devotion to poetry and to
the idea of a comunitas that would remain "pure."  I haven't read all
the way through, but I think the book might in part be about how such
poetic heroism is doomed to failure from the start, and much of the
book, in fact, is not all that "pleasant" to read.

In any case, I would strongly urge everyone to check this
impressive book out. (In it, in fact, you can even read about
George Bowering and David Bromige, so loved by others on this list
and so obviously adoring of each other!)

_Poet Be Like God: Jack Spicer and the San Francisco Renaissance_,
by Lew Ellingham and Kevin Killian. Check it out, and write to the
publisher requesting more photographs in the second edition.

This is Dodie.  I urge you all to check out Laura Moriarty's intro to non 3
(Headache).  Laura does an excellent job of talking about that space where
pain takes over and language/"selfhood" collapses.  Using language to talk
about such a thing, is obviously a losing proposition, but in this case I
think Laura wins.  So often writing about The Body leads into an almost
comic abstraction/dis-embodiment.  It's satisfying to see someone giving
the body its due, respecting rational limits, the grungy
nose-pressed-against-the-wallness of it all.  Been doing lots of
body-centered readings this past year.  Recently I've moved from
theory-type books to memoirs.  Just finished Autobiography of a Face, and
while the book falls apart in the second half, the first half, the
precision of Grealy's descriptions of chemo-therapy and anaesthesia are
stunning.

So, good work, Laura!  Headache is a perfect antidote to so much, so much.

Oops. Sorry. I  admit to a hair-trigger sensitivity to the money-is-bad theory.

I don't know exactly why I keep thinking of this, but when I studied at Brooklyn
College (yeah, yeah...for an MFA) I visited Allen Ginsberg at his home, and was
always curious about his apartment in a crummy eastside neighborhood. Was is a bad
apartment because it was in a bad neighborhood? A good apartment 'cause it was big
& airy by NYC standards? A good apartment because it was probably rent-controlled
&, therefore, cheap? A bad apartment because it was rented cheaply to a man with a
professorship and, presumably, a good deal of money, instead of to someone with
less money available to them? A bad apartment because he could have had a better,
more prestigious one on the upper westside? A good one for the very same reason?

Who knows? I'd be lame to judge. He was a great guy & we never saw eye to eye
about poetry but he still generously played his Kerouac-reading-poetry tapes for
me.

To me it is increasingly unimaginable as to anyone being able to earn a
modest, but adequte, livelihood, from any kind of art. Least of all from the
writing of poetry. I cannot, in fact, imagine how anyone can do it, even
though I know there are some people who actually do so. (However, I have
never met any who earn an adequate livelihood solely by such means.)

What used to be even more unimaginable to me, was the idea that doing art,
and particularly writing poetry, can in fact reduce one's chances of success
in other attempts at earning a livelihood. That is, even if all else is
essentially equal. There seems to be a built in bias, or prejudice, against
the artist, and the poet, in many non artistic, and non literary, situations.

What is even more unimaginable than that is that works of art and poetry
have had their effectiveness as means of communicative expression reduced
severely.
It is very difficult to effectively express anything more personal, outside
of the constraints of nearly anonymous (at least depersonalized) work of art
as product meant for an anonymous mass market.

I cannot, for instance, be certain that a poet or artist is permitted, in
our post-modern world, any right to express passionate love for some other
person,
via any artistic medium of expression. I simply do not know that it is possible
to use art in that way, though we know that traditionally it has been used
that way in many an instance.

So there is the push to question 1). art for money, and 2). art for the sake
of communicative expression from person to person.

What is left when those two "uses" of art are disempowered ?

Is art, as such, being redefined, en masse, as products of artists, such
that those products cannot and do not have any elements of personal
communicative interaction included in their substantive discernable meanings ?

Is art to become limited to what can be produced by a production mechanism,
and mass marketed to a market of everyperson ?  Is that enough to satisfy any
artist ?  Does it really satisfy the art consumer ?

I tend to be somewhat existentialist about the arts, and I am both a visual
artist and a poet, but I have no experiential basis for answering those
questions in any positive way. Also, though there have been essentially
impersonal expressions of appreciation, in consumer to producer terms, there
has been no monetary achievement from any kind of effort at artistic production.
Of course, artistic expression has fared even worse than production.

It seems sometimes a distant dream to _have_ some balance between being able
to produce improvements in one's own artistic work, make a  steady
livelihood at something else that is considered useful enough, and have the
joys and contentments of a love life with someone where there is some mutual
enjoyment of life and each other. I am not even certain that the struggles
to keep one's artist alive, and to be able to better one's own art, are
sustainable, in the often unpredictable turbulence of economic systems and
their constantly changing demands. As for achieving passionate mutuality,
that requires communicative interaction of specific kinds, quite distinct
from any mass appeal, artistic criticism, or economic interactions.

Standing at one end of the field and looking across its vast expanse, I
shudder, and feel exhausted at its "infinite" complexities. Enough
complexity that anything personal, sensitive, intimate, and passionate, so
easily suffers, more
than our art is able to say.

WARNING-LONG POST-DELETE NOW

perhaps Yale University Press should prepare its Younger Poets series for
such a catastrophe as the Oregon Lottery Commission. The case of the
lottery provides a useful frame for viewing the problem with the contest
racket which Katy pointed out in a recent post. They say your chances of
winning the lottery are less than being picked as a Yale Younger Poet, but
both require that you must pay in order to play. You may have a million in
one chance of winning, but that assumes you buy a ticket. If you don't
approve of the system, it seems to me that you can REFUSE to buy a ticket
as a first step towards dismantling the system. You can buy a ticket and
hope to win, knowing that when you win it won't matter whether the system
is corrupt. In both circumstances the rewards tend to erase the years of
griping and losing. At least one language"" poet was involved in the
lottery system, exporting such revenue generating technologies to places
like Africa and Oregon.

Personally, I wouldn't send my 25 bucks to any organization I didn't
believe in & frankly I'm not going to win the Yale Series never mind the
Sun & Moon anything, tho I will continue to send them my money and buy
their books to show my support for the kinds of literature they
produce--never mind the poets whose words are contained within their
modest covers.

Katy remarks that the 700 poets sending x.dollars to Yale raised about
10,000 for the press. Does that go straight to the trustees, or does
Merwin himself have to take the bushel of checks down to the Bank? (many
of which I'm sure will bounce, seeing that they are written by Cowboy
poets from "upstate" and the rest of the provinces) No, I'm sure there are
some grad students whose summer jobs include sorting and sifting through
the papers, poems, cover letters etc. Does Merwin read them all? no, I'm
sure there is some kind of staff there to help with all this, at least one
person. Assuming that there are two people, one who lugs the loot down to
the bank, and one to sort and well, you know, decide which poems Merwin
will actually see, aside from the ones which are pre-decided winners set
up by his cronies at Universities, urban centers, cow-pastures, and the
like. That means that the two staffers are splitting about 8,000, or 4
thousand a piece. The other two thousand pays off the university b-crats
who let these poets take up University real estate.  Assume that this is a
summer job, ok, a four month job. That means they are earning about 1,000
a month before taxes. Subtract commuter costs (these grads live in new
York, and pay 1,000 a month each to rent), etc. etc. and it becomes hardly
worth it for them. But as students of Merwin, they truly belive in this.
Charles Bernstein writes somwhere that it costs about 5,000 (I forget the
exact number) to produce, distribute, advertise, etc, the average small
press book of poetry. I've always found this to be a bit high, but then
I've only recently begun fantasizing about producing perfect bound books
printed and assembled in Ann Arbor. But ok, we'll take that number.
Imagine the trustees at Yale, when they hear about the deep hole of
financial losses sustained annually by the Yale Younger Series. Imagine
the rhetoric of diversity & democritization used to secure the funds
required to produce a first book by a poet who may or may not write
another book. In the crony system, such "continuity of literary
tradition"(Silliman's phrase from The Political Economy of Poetry) is
maintained by the network of mutually supporting poet entrepreneurs

Granting institutions generally require that the recipient of the grant
demonstrate an effort at collecting revenue, however modest, as a show of
good faith. We already know that these books will not sell. Imagine the
contest system as a sort of corrupted lottery, with 99.9% of the contests
living in a total dream world as to their actual chances, while the .01%
crosses their fingers, hoping that their "contacts" will come thru for
them. The bouncing ping-pong balls are just an illusion of a democratic
process...everybody knows that!

But let's go back to Silliman's essay, where he describes what Laura
Riding called "the forced professionalization of poetry." The rhetoric
that Katy used in her post, referring to the marginalized cowboys whose
romantic visions of a poetry divorced from specialized and institutionally
legitimized networks (such as MFA programs), this kind of talk just
demonstrates how far apart we are in this "community." Wow. How far we
have come. Where once we had the "forced professionalization" of the poet
at the end of the 60s, with the balooning of the university system, a
professionalization that declawed the oppositional poets, neutralizing
them for the suburban "accomodationist" poets such as Lowell, tho I've
always enjoyed his work. This distinction I'm borrowing from I think
Culture and Value by Von Hallberg, tho I dont ahve this book. Though many
people have written on this topic. Then there was an opening in an often
unaffiliated "underground" of poets--whatever you may say about them--in
the 1970s, who developed their own industry of poetry distribution and
yayaya. Now it seems that we're going to borrow all those technological
advances of formal devices, and lower them into the grave of
specialization, professionalism, and finally, ignominy, while adopting the
superstructures they sought to undo. And frankly, it was the same
superstructures that Creeley and the "New americans" fought against: the
academic drivel of the previous bygone era. So...while you may try to
setup your gendered cowboy constructs, I will resist you all the way. My
reference to the story of Creeley visiting Celia and Louis Zukofsky was
told because that story truly makes me happy. It gives me hope. By
situating yourself with baby, you take the high ground, to the grubby
cowboy poet in need from a little help from friends. I think when he went
to visit them he was in fact a parent (i'm not sure, however when that
happened). If I had a child--and anyone who knows me knows that I envy all
parents and I cry often about the loss I have experiened in my life in
this regard--I would certainly take a coat as a gift if I was in need,
rather than stubbornly insist on the whole apartment...

The Zapruder family wants $40 mill from the gov't for the original
film of the JFK assassination.  The 6 oclock news tried to belittle
them - "the question is, does history belong to the people, or
is it in private hands?" (the gov't is offering $20 mill). A Kennedy
desk went at auction for 1.5 mill.  Toyota Civics now offer wider
space in back and they are for people who have a sense of tradition and opening
their own garage doors, they are only $16,000 (cheap, huh?)

Joel's post - pretty astonishing.  Funny though that from Jack Spandrift's
ultra-cowboy perspective, Creeley,Bernstein, Silliman, and your heroes
merge with the other academic operators... so many axes to grind.
Creeley came and read at Brown University, as part of some tour
no doubt... distinguished guest, tweed plus eyepatch... must have
landed a few thousand through the buddy system there... how do you tell
the difference?  Standard's take on New Directions (ol boy money
all the way) is relevant...
Does this have something to do with Bourdieu?  Distinguishing presses
within a cultural pecking order?  Yes, the deconstruction of Yale
Younger Adolescents was great - but why is your buddy system any better?
Because you're broke?

I ask again... where's the poetry?

BIRD

Overhead the internal workings
of the sound of your voice,
the bright world we waited for
in the sense of a lost cause,
or a joke and its day after
among the gathering crowd.

And the constant lessons,
running up to the buildings.
John's day and your hopes
rubbing shoulders, the sheep
folding into the hills beyond.

How are we to take this?
Detectives probe the galleries,
the ice-cold promises bending
the daylight into shapes,
houses, families, dreams,

and by April you could laugh
when the leaves folded up your hopes,
and the important idea was no sense
consummated in the old headlands,
dogs barking, and babies crying.

Somehow in the cold chair light,
under a rainy month,
sentenced for life, the brown day
stops by the bed with a hush,
the aftermath, all sold out.

Someone mentioned _Libra_ and _Underworld_ a while ago. I was thinking

inner-city stigmata. An evolution for Delillo; not an inadequate marker
of writerly possiblities. now. not a paranoid style anymore. paranoia is
a luxury. pop culture.

In the 80s there was a sociological category called 'homeless'. Kinda
like the Watten's _Bad History_ introductory refrain of architectural

nOw, you have various legislations against pan-handling. poetry

put the pole over like he was fishing. when they left he held it out to
all the consequential georgetown-area foot traffic. iN dc it used to be
called the peoples park, across from the white house. now its not and
you can't sleep there anymore, the park police ride up horses in that

(otherside of town from the experiments in poetry). buffalo cops know
whats up. in that station.  they might even be poets.) I'm quite sure
that the Younger Poet entry fee goes straight to that other NEW HAVEN.
outside the wall. Goes probably for basic health care and dictionaries
in the public libraries, or, in a pinch, to a day-care center for
wealfare-moms on clintonian welfare reform. that is: a state-form
methadone program. but no needle-exchange. no real chance out.

Its true Deleuzes 'control' seems an equivalence to Foucault's
'discipline'. But this is somewhat illusory. linda russo is right, I
think, the way out is 'through the door'. Not just a derridean paradox
of agon. Rather. a deleuzian, anti-dialectical, non-hegelian sentiment.
poets like other former revolutionsists manque continue to hope for that
teleological OTHER backdoor. Even as modernist earnestness. Or humanist
redaction. Like we were living in a shot-gun shack. a front and a back.
only. but there are other MINOR literatures, lines of flight, other
doors through (does anyone like the new translation of Kafka's
_Castle_?) beyond a poetry of symptomology.

ok, i've gone on at too much lenght, and I'm broke tonight. But I think
I'll have a beer. And spandrift? you wanna come over and make
reterritorialized humanist love with me? maybe we can find that poetree
you been lookin for. That new film _WILDE_ a cinematic treatment of
Ellman's biography of Oscar is a case study in old-money, new aesthetics
and being pilloried. And I was just reading William Finnegan's _Cold New
World_ and all that obvious declension in Keynesian economic terms since
1973. Its not just the younger poets. its the younger at all. embodied

        I have found the discussion of poetry and money  painful.  There have
been attitudes, of course, about MFA programs and about academics and about
the honor of not making money, etc.  But what is the issue?  Joel Kuszai (who
has been consistently acute in his posts) was right to mention Laura Riding's
denunciation of the professionalization of poetry.  The book to which he
refers, _Contemporaries and Snobs_  is the only useful discussion on the
development of the "profession" of poetry that I know. I thought I had  a
xerox of it somewhere in my files, I wanted to just quote some passages, but I
can't seem to locate it now. (Though I did find a xerox of _Anarchism Is Not
Enough_, another  great, forgotten Riding book that bears on a current
discussion.)

        At any rate, what Riding refers to has nothing directly to do with
money,   she is concerned with the creation of professional standards for
poetry--the _precondition_ that made it possible to tenure poets in the
university, to give prizes, fellowships, subsidized publication (of course,
the commercial presses used to subsidize poetry; now only a diminishing few
university presses do), etc. It was in fact part of the professionalization of
the humanities and arts in general, as a way to protect a certain high-sense
of human possibilities from the mass media. That is, the "culture" became
something one learned in school, rather than something one absorbed with
mother's milk as Dante said. I learned "culture" in high school from Rose
Roebaum, who told me "a poem is a beautiful thought or a beautiful scene
expressed in beautiful words," and then from the state university where I was
taught my culture was Wyatt and Surrey and Donne and Bach.  I am happy to know
about that great stuff, but in fact, it was not true: my culture was Little
Richard, Jackie Gleason, Elvis, Otis Redding, and by a certain stretch, Miles
Davis.

        After WW II, a group of poets managed to create a kind of
anti-profession, out of Black Mountain, the San Francisco Renaissance, and so
forth, but it turned out that the 60s university could absorb it to: Olson,
Creeley, Dorn, and many others ending up teaching, but only because the
university--at least in the humanities and arts--  failed to maintain its
professional standards and never created new ones that could accommodate these
poets (or Duchamp or Cage or Smithson).

        The professionalism of culture was an aberration that lasted 60 or so
years, an attempt of the traditional high-culture to maintain itself against
the impossible odds of Radio and TV. (Of course, now, with Cultural Studies,
even that culture is being professionalized, which must mean that it too is
already dead.  It will be a while before we see what is replacing it, though
it may be an anarchist (i.e. an-archai, without origin or first principle)
fragmentation. Not mass culture, but culture without generalization. Anarchism
may still not be enough.

        At any rate, I am glad I do not have to try to establish a life in
these treacherous waters, and I sympathize with the problem of those of you
who do.  There is a web site that might be of interest to any of you who are
trying to find a way in and around universities:  Palinurus: The Academy and
the Corporation -- Teaching the Humanities in a Restructured World
(http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/liu/palinurus/index2.html). Although it is just
getting started, Alan Liu has put a great deal there to think about.

        Katy / clarification well taken.  in my case, at least, i found
that writing from leisure (afforded any way at all) produces writing for
leisure.  which is fine.  i certainly go in for an entertaining poem or
two in my "free" time.  but, i feel very strongly that the discourse which
literature ought to entertain is one which is ecumenical, as far as the
distribution of leisure, power, legitimacy.  therefore, figuring out how
to accrue "extra" time for writing ought to be balanced by an extra effort
elsewhere.  the academy seems like a very high-priced way to do this.  i'm
not fantasizing my way out of my own situation via radical (Marxist, etc.)
theory theoretical stances; i'm attempting to connect literature to my
situation, which has never required a prize or a glossy, perfectbound
format to engage those with the similar desire (obligation? [or sense
thereof]) of listening to whomever is useful at the time / Patrick F.

this is my last message for a while. I promise. I can feel the yakyak of
emotional puke catching up to me and it is time to turn off this channel
for a while. I'll be available (on and off) backchannel if anyone wants to
talk. In the meantime, Henry asked about poetry. Here is another excerpt
of my ongoing rewrite of the wizard of oz. I hope evenually to make it
back "home" and be done with the discursive utopias that this space
promises but does not deliver. When it is done, I hope to read it in
public, as it is very important to me. This is in progress, so keep that
in mind.  One final quote from my boyhood hero, Robert Creeley "If it
isn't fun don't do it / you'll have enough to do that isn't. // And if you
can't keep it, who needs it anyway."  well, that's a paraphrase anyhow...
Have Fun!


Introduction

In what follows joy is retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left
out. This song aspires to be a modernized fairy tale, in which the
wonderment of childish hearts takes precedence over all other human
creations. Comprised of disagreeable incidents, education includes
morality & therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its
wonder-tales, and with an instinctive love for stories fantastic,
marvelous and manifestly unreal, gladly dispenses with all that may be
classed as "historical," where the authors give a fearsome moral to each
tale.



Canto 10   Into the Forest / Bower Blisse


"Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable"



A woman opened it just far enough to look out
and see the visitors waiting
the door was a lovely emerald-green color
and the people wore peaked hats like those in movies
but he refused to see us and we had to return
to our site along the forest's edge
where the poppies grew
After a few hours the road began to get rough
   the walking was a great deal of hard work
 for the Lion was heavy and slow
In an hour or so the light faded
  the crows had gone I thought this over
suddenly we came upon a broad river
 flowing swiftly in the afternoon
   sometimes people came to the doors   looked
  rushed forward
   the Lion crossed over the tree
  said the Tinman sadly
  I wish I had a heart to beat



Those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart
clicked and stopped its impervious author
look how gray everything was there!
how the cyclone    the people
had never seen a dog before
they had suffered many discouragements
but before them an ordinary girl
who had come by the chance of a cyclone
uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool
said the Tin Woodman
my brain is a dish of scrambled eggs
a plate of nice white bread
as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy
the Emerald City is   the other end of the road
in a squeaky little voice:
crying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak
She offered other flowers
I will give you some supper   a place to sleep
it will take you many days
The country here is rich
Aren't they beautiful?  the girl
   she breathed in
    climbed on the Lion's back
 holding tightly to his mane
   a better man than some of them
  he feared a spark might   burn him up
beautiful green fields before them
    the raft was nearly done
  that isn't the way we Lions do things
  you wear silver shoes
and have killed the Wicked Witch


  tree trunk
  mice spoke
  up to the door and knocked
  met over the road of yellow
  It was almost dark
  and they all sang sweetly
  I am not afraid so long as I have my oil-can
  I do not want people to call me a fool
 and if my head stays
  it takes time to make a raft
 even when one is industrious
  We cannot fly
 that is certain


caught the dog and held him tight
  Toto!  said the girl anxiously
   What will protect him?
   the flowers were too strong for me
  How did you get me out?
 comrades
 what shall we do now?



If I only had a heart I should love them
but it requires brains to figure it out
I should never have said
this road goes in, it must come out
if we cannot jump over it
we must stop where we are



No
 but you tried to
  she retorted
   You are nothing but a
No
 for this pole is stuck up my back
  If you will please
 indeed
  I don't know anything
  You see
 I am stuffed



Oh yes said the girl
 where you found me
give me a heart
or send me back to Kansas
or stick a pin in me
it doesn't matter
for I can't feel it

I've heard about this before, and I'm curious: is it cheaper (tax laws
taken into consideration) to destroy the books or to give them away? And
why?

"The Physiocratic school, following Aristotelian and Confucian
philosophy, argued for the preeminence of the natural order, whose rules
provided for the continuity of human sciences. Quesnay endeavored to
apply the mores of China to the grave problems confronting France, and
to craft general principles of government. His model was one of
enlightened despotism, under which the "positive" laws, i.e. statutes,
would be drafted especially to give effect to the sublime set of

if I recall, Tony Towle (?) put out a marvelous little document in the late
70's that tabulated what he SPENT on poetry vs what he earned. he
calculated drinks at bar readings, entrance fees at the poetry project,
cost of postage to mail submissions, typewriter ribbons (rememeber them?) &
paper itself. He then totaled what he got from the occassional paying mag,
fees for giving readings and other writing related gigs --well, as you
guesed, he ended up in the debit column.

i may be insane, but have always liked poetry's realative
non-commodification. Hell, even Grand Poobahs like Pinsky and Levine make
far less than a law firm partner in New York. There are also levels of
participation suited to one's life situation. Most of my companeros in
jersey read at local venues, publsih in local magazines and don't get
knocked up in the head when Charles Wright wins a Pulitzer.

what despair sounds like


i can't sleep any more at all, not with melatonin not without. i hate here
where i am. i can't get work, everything in my life is in shambles. i
think a lot about death, it seems i should make a story out of this where
Nikuko says "hi death," and death answers something clever back and you
can't tell who is really speaking and i'd sign the post alan - whomever or
better in light of my life, alan - whatever, because it's more like a
thing this thing is thinking of or thinks it's thinking of. because i
can't persist under all this stress just like this laptop's running on
battery power because the storms are coming again and there's electric
energy running wild through the wires and i need to save these machines
for inheritance. so they will keep working when i can't. so they will be
carrying the viruses of languages i write because everything i write is in
another language, this is in another language that Nikuko calls "last
language."

now this is the point where i run out of steam, where the writing begins
to collapse because i can't be clever any longer. i look in this room and
i say, i say, i don't belong here. and i look at my face on my body and i
say, this doesn't belong there, doesn't belong there.

and i wait for the perfect phonecall returning the debris of a perfect job
in new york while i make a nuisance of myself desperately following up on
an identity that has slid past the imaginary into the coffee-grounds of
the real, as if ha ha ha, some sort of joke might have passed by the cen-
sors at that point. now yelling in the street as i prepare to wait for the
dawn senselessly another seven hours away.

there will be more yelling, more storms. there will be faces falling from
faces. there will be entertainments, yes there will, there will be enter-
tainments.

On the other hand, Charles, I remember that when I was growing up in a
dicky little orchard town I bought a kind of mass market paperback from the
pool hall, kinda book that was available then, anthologies of recent US
poetry, and that joined with other less choate things to persuading me that
there was such a thing as mortal poets. These were usually the kind of
poets one didnt want to be or read, but at age 16 one didnt know that yet.

Yeah, but Bromide is not telling the whole story. I gave that $12 to an

1. The social conditions of poetry.
S. Schaefer and P. Durgin are correct here in discerning this as the
salient point. Cheers to Schaefer for pointing out the conditions of
class privilege that allow for the production of many poetry books:
leisure, that is freedom from paid work equaling time and space in which
to write, on the part of some writers; and wealth to access the means of
production on the part of many editors/publishers. There is no reason to
judge wealth as "evil," or poverty as "virtuous." If a writer is not
afforded the material conditions in which to write, there will be no
need to judge their work against those of leisure, because there won't
be any. There is no virute in being poor. Class oppression is suffering.
For those of us from poor or working class backgrounds, or who currently
struggle economically, just carving out the time in which to write at
all is a damn miracle.

2. There is no "clean" part of capitalism.
Whether you work in a union job pulling lines on a tugboat guiding
oil-carrying ships into the SF Bay, or sit in a tenure-track job
professing poetry all day, or trade stocks for a living, it's all the
same system, and none of us are cleaner than the rest. In other words, I
don't care what stocks you buy or don't buy, it's all the same fucking
thing. Though, of course, the ruling class has much to answer for. And
why is that whenever someone has the guts to point out the very real
class differences that exist within the poetry community, someone has to
come along and say, "Oh, no, money is GOOD. I'm not bad because I have
money." As if that were the point! There are very real class differences
here folks; get used to it. Class differences which translate into daily
experiences central to one's life in the world, one's life as a poet.

Thanks to all for the many good posts on this topic.

Thanks to Henry (and to Rachel!) for injecting a little circumspection into
this $ morass.  While we're on the subject, does anyone have a copy of an
Amis piece out of that running-dog rag The New Yorker a couple years back in
which the fictional lives of a poet and a screenwriter were flipped, the
poet on the coast doing a million-dollar rewrite and the broke screenwriter
trying to schmooze & booze a sadsack editor of a tiny journal into
publishing his latest?  Top cent paid.

i thought Merwin was trying to pull an Auden by not selecting a winner for
the Yale thing and was wondering if the press still screens the
manuscripts, as they did then, because what happened was Auden didn't get
excited about any that they had filtered to him so he asked for some more
and he got O'Hara and Ashbery.

How could Merwin declare a no winner if he hadn't read all the manuscripts?

when i was growing up the career options were
from home: academic academic academic
from school: nurse, elementary school teacher
from popular culture: outlaw

i guess i picked up a little of each
the poet is entwined with the latter
but nobody it's true said poet
but they all gave me poetry to read or hear

Listarians,

Poetry's relationship to money is so nebulous and money's relationship to
everything else in our lives is so often so charged with endless manner of
social/family/self-imposed pressures that a discussion of this sort seems
infinitely difficult to embark upon. I've been generally amazed at how much
wisdom (thank you joel kuszai, thank you karen kelly) I've seen on this list
in the past couple of days.

I have only a couple of thoughts that I want to add.

First is that the product, to speak in strictly mercantile terms, of the
poet is not the poem. The money in poetry -- readings, grants, teaching jobs
-- is all so ancillary to any given poem that the connection makes no real
sense. There is a wonderful comment somewhere in Whalen's On Bear's Head
(one of the great hard-to-find books) to the effect of "at 50 cents a line
in Poetry (Chicago), this poem is now worth ..." (I forget the amount).

Instead, the product for a poet is the life's work, around which individual
poems and books are really features. Just as an academic's product is
generally going to be his or her c.v., it's the bibliography or (more
accurately) everything they have done in and around the poetry scene "as
poets" but also as reading curators, editors, publishers, critics, goads,
etc. The value that Kevin & Dodie bring to SF, or the Tyshes to Detroit, or
Charles Alexander to Tucson or Rae Armantrout to San Diego or Rod Smith to
DC or Gil Ott to Philadelphia or or or (the list quickly becomes rather
infinitely expanding) cannot be gauged by how much Dodie makes from her book
(even when a movie gets made and we see Mira Sorvino as Mina), and, hey,
it's a novel, not a poem so how does that get calculated in? (Actually, the
category of "poets novels" from Melville through Kerouac through Acker to
Bellamy & Killian is a whole other thread worth thinking about.) We hope
that these people will, over time, be rewarded for everything they do,
although the politics of the literary scene absolutely do not guarantee it.

Second is that there are lots of reasons to go to school and incur the debt
that comes with it. It's a shame and foolish, though, if the idea of a "job"
or "money" is a consideration when the degree is an MFA in poetry. If all
the tenured poetry professors dropped dead today...

(a) there would not be enough spots open for all of the recent MFA grads,

AND

(b) most of the newly vacated spots would not get filled anyway

The more dangerous problem that comes with an MFA, I think, (and this goes
also for the PhD in Poetics, I might note) is that the person with same is
easily seduced into the adjunct/migrant labor market on a "temporary" basis
only to wake up 20 years later with no money, no pension, no health care
and far fewer marketable skills than they would have had if they'd worked at
Borders instead.

And that is criminal.

 I found my copy of  Riding's Contemporaries and Snobs.  Here is part of the
passage I wanted to read into the record:


 "There is a sense of life so real that it becomes the sense of something more
real than life. Spatial and temporal sequences can only partially express it…. It
is the meaning at work in what has no meaning; it is, at its clearest, poetry.

Unfortunately this sense, which can in its origin be only a personal one, is
easily professionalized.  From observations of it in written works, rules are made
for it, intentions ascribed to it.  There results what has come to be called
criticism.  Criticism in turn uses this sense against itself.  It dissociates it
from its creative origin.  In the end the ‘literary' sense comes to be the
authority-to-write which the poet is supposed to receive, though criticism, from
the age that he lives in.  It is not even in each age a new literary sense, but
merely a tradition revised and brought up to date.  More and more the poet has
been made to conform to literature instead of literature to the poet…"

As she notes, the move to professionalize literature began in the sixteenth
century, but,  she is writing in direct response to the establishment of the
professional code by her contemporaries, most notably, of course, Eliot and the
institutions, academic and otherwise, that grew up around him:

 Riding continues:

"The universe still had a myth requiring the ritualistic services of poetry.  The
new myth was that there was no myth.  Delighted with this discovery, criticism
rushed to the rescue of the unnumbered poets who, being individual  and not, like
criticism, a public institution, had perhaps not noticed that anything was
happening at all but continued to wirte as they had always written, for reasons
that they left others to discover.  For people never live in contemporary history:
they live either in the past or completely  outside the time-sense.  So the course
of criticism… was to announce, first, that historical conditions had put an end to
poetry, removing all hope in order to bring home to poets the proper time-sense,
then to follow this melancholy report with the cheerful amendment that, after all,
all hope not gone, since, if poetry had one subject of which poetry could not be
deprived, namely that poetry had not come to an end.  Here was an ingenious method
for indefinitely postponing the end of poetry; and, after the general applause
which followed this remarkable solution, many volunteers stepped forward and
declared feeling that the time-sense had been brought home to them and that, now
that it had been made clear to them that poetry was at an end, they felt sure that
they could write better poetry than ever.  Never indeed, they said, had such an
urgent reason for writing poetry been presented to poets.  Under the spell of this
enthusiasm a tremendous revival of poetry took place; and not only was better
poetry, but more poetry than ever written.  Since poetry was to write about
nothing, it could write about everything form the standpoint of nothing; it could
still have its epics with the burden of having to have convictions about it."

 "Meaning at work in what has no meaning" cannot become the basis for a
profession, cannot be institutionalized. It would be like a carpenter claiming to
make houses that have no house.

been wanting to impart a few twists & turns on the poetry-money couple for
a few days now, and am reading don's and ron's and karen's and joel's and
henry's and standard's and rachel's and kathy's and katy's and anthony's
and karen's and erik's and jacques' and charles' and linda's and bob's and
well i-don't-know-whose posts with great interest and, even, appreciation
for the depth of emotions and convictions expressed...

first, i want to try to distinguish between the 'is' and the 'ought to be'
here, just for a moment... "the relationship between poetry and money is
such & such" [whatever you think] does not necessarily mean it *ought to be
that way*... and some folks actively work to correct the "crime" (as ron
puts it---in whatever form this crime manifests itself)... as some would
have it, as i read them, there is nothing to be done about poetry and $$$
b/c it's well and good that the two are kept apart... for me, they've never
been apart, exactly, which isn't to say that there is a causal/reciprocal
relationship between each word i write and each dollar i net... but simply
to observe that money problems (real problems, some forced upon me and some
a function of choices i've made) have been a regular, daily, conscious part
of my life for three decades now, and it's hard to discern where my work
entire departs from kathy's class issues (i'm using "class" here as a
shorthand for struggling to make ends meet)...

but of course it's so very complicated, and here i'll speak as one of them
english profs about this, and risk a very personal observation or two---so
please bear with me, esp. those of you who tire of whining academics (hell,
*i* tire of whining academics, i tire of myself)... i was going to respond
to this as a former corporate type, in fact---the feelings i experienced
when i had a steady income that was also a living wage (the two are not
coterminus), and aspired to be a poet/artist... but it's don byrd's posts
on the professionalization of poetry etc. that inspires me to respond
initially as an academic...

recently (as most of you know by now) i was denied tenure at illinois
institute of technology, where i work (i.e., as a worker)... as is my
right, i requested clarification and appealed, and in the course of denying
my appeal iit's president enumerated a few of the reasons why i would not
be tenured at iit... now:  you all know, i'm sure, that bureaucratic texts,
though generally written at the sixth grade level, require advanced reading
skills in order to be interpreted correctly (yes, there is a correct
interpretation)... and you all know, too, that it's impossible for me to
expose the entire, six-year long network of relationships and events that
led to my denial (some of which would no doubt lead you to conclude that i
had a hand in my own denial, and must therefore accept a certain
responsibility for outright mistakes i've made)... in any case, two things
become evident in reading over the president's response:  (1) that there is
"little doubt about the quality of [my] scholarship and teaching" (indeed,
i was the most highly recommended of all six candidates for tenure in the
past year---recommended, that is, by all faculty committees); and (2) there
were yet "concerns ... about the degree to which [my] contributions are
aligned with the new vision of iit"... please read this latter as
ominously, and literally, as you can... as i've indicated before in these
spaces, iit's vision is distinctively and increasingly corporate---and
clearly, though i was not hired to teach poetry but to teach technical
writing, there is something about me that is perceived, rightly i think
(and hope), as contra this corporate tendency...

i was not surprised by the decision to deny me (and my colleague)
tenure----it's fair to say that i was the only faculty member not surprised
(well, there was *one* other who knew it was gonna happen)... but just b/c
i saw it coming does not mean that it was deserved, anymore than it means
that i alone undid myself... fact is, imnsho, i deserved tenure (if
deservin's got anything to do with it), and that, in any case, this lack of
justice, if you will, at iit (and elsewhere) is something to be resisted...
part of the reason i say this is b/c profs need academic freedom---but i'll
say no more about this here...

ok, so the professionalization to which don refers is, in my case anyway,
not exactly about professionalizing poetry per se... though it might be
argued that this is taking place in some sense---from where i sit, this is
a relatively small if significant aspect of a larger reality... it would
perhaps be more accurate to say that professionalization is about turning
the world into a professional place, a place in which poetry is ok as long
as said poet doesn't ruffle any feathers... and here again, it's not my
poetry gives offense, folks, it's not even the anti-institutional prose
that i often write... in fact i doubt that my president or his crony, the
v-p, have read a word of my poetry, or my prose (that "one other" colleague
to whom i refer above surely has not)... but these administrators have it
on good authority that i'm not a team player... and this perception of me
is largely accurate, if i do say so, in part b/c i have a habit of not
sleeping with the enemy, and of telling the enemy that i'd rather not sleep
with her/him (please not to attribute any self-aggrandizing gesture to me
here---i do my share of asskissing---as everyone must, i suppose... i'm
simply indicating that i draw a line---as everyone must, i suppose...
obviously i believe that there are, finally, enemies)...

it should likewise be clear that the professionalization to which don
refers is hardly restricted to academe... i experienced an almost identical
reaction to my own mouthy presence back in 1984, when i was working as a
senior project engineer for bristol- myers co... that's another story, but
one that parallels closely my current life-narrative... same shit,
different day, different place...

of course i've had numerous occasions in my life to ponder whether i'm
simply a malcontent... but this inkling of self-doubt (if that's what it
is) is quickly allayed when i consider the obvious ploys and hair-brained
"educational" or "industrial" plots in which i've been embroiled, all
presumably to better produce or produce a better "product" (whether
student-widget or just plain widget)...

money and poetry?... in many ways my life-choices (i hate that word
"career" too, judy!) have amounted to money *or* poetry (via teaching---i
think of myself as a writer first, though i maintain that i'm paid as a
teacher-bureaucrat first)... still, this latter is a crude and i think
ultimately reductive opposition, b/c poetry is part of what i do as a
writer (not as, btw, "the writer"), part of what i do as a teacher and
scholar (i am not a scholar, really), part of what i do as a worker, part
of what i do as an earthling... poetry is nice in part b/c it *does* "free
me up," relatively speaking, from the forces of commodification under which
most novelists (e.g.) work and suffer (this is not to suggest that poetry
operates in the absence of institutional gradients---they're there, no
matter how transcendental or mythic the reading/writing occasion of the
poem, which i've little doubt can be transcendent and mythic)...

but there's no way, no way i can imagine myself a writer w/o thinking
continually and even apprehensively about how to earn a living... "in the
midst of" what, exactly, is part of what i think about---and how to alter
not simply myself (in my more adaptive moments), but that little part of
the "what" with which i am alternately, i suppose, in or out of
"alignment"...

best,

Yes, Boering, but she was only unwed because you refused to wed her.

Seriously, folks, my twobitsworth re poetry/money/career, while merely
anecdotal, & personal at that, might help out someone . . . When time came
for grad school, I told my mentor, the Great Canadian Author Earle Birney,
that I was thinking of taking a master's in creative writing. He reasoned
me out of it, thus : "There are more jobs for PhDs in English than for MAs
in c.w. You will continue to write poetry in any case. Do what I did, get a
PhD, get hired, then get them--on the strength of your publishing--to give
you a c.w. course or two."

It should be said, there were far fewer schools offering grad degrees in
c.w. in the early 60s.

But even today, this makes for sound advice. Boering is correct to warn
against the adjunct colon-izing that besets c.w. teachers even more than
PhDs in English.

In the event, I was hired in my one and only (lifetime) tenured job on the
"ABD" status of my doctoral studies (which stayed that way), & my books of
poetry. By a twist of fate Earle couldnt have foreseen,during the early
70s, when poetry was still so weirdly popular, 3 of the 4 course I taught
each semester, were poetry writing classes. Fortunately, this interest
waned later on, and I was freed up to teach contemporary anglophone
poetries--which courses were much like the c.w. classs had been, but w/o
student-indited poems to discuss.(From the potentially negative readings of
this paragraph I exempt all my ex-students on this List). But it was the
straight doctorate that got my foot in the door. For what that was worth :
a pension and a health plan.

As a p.s. of sorts : The Cal State Univ system operates on the Peter
Principle : if "they" can teach efficiently at 3 courses/semester, let's
give em 4. So try to get hired elsewhere than in the CSUS.

A work gig brings me to NoCal (near Concord) late June through mid-July.
Any readings going on?

Also, anything in San Diego June 24-28?

Questions about poetry's connection with society, its utility, its
connections with elates or oppressors.
if poetry is important why doesn't it pay better? as if pay was the
important value. it's the dominant one, and i feel that domination is a
serious threat to society and the planet in general.
poetry is an art whose medium is language. tons of discussion on the place
of art in a society, pluses and minuses, from brain-washing to epiphanies.
still i believe that language is a deep intelligence, can tap parts of
brain not usually used, can influence people to take a broader (in measures
like historical, systemic, global) perspective, to be more open to the
other  (than technical and capitalistic) dimensions of evolution humans are
capable of.
i feel the best thing i can do with my life is tap into language the way i
do in what comes out as poems.
i cant support myself on that, and feel sad and ripped off that way, but
that how things are. some "poets" do support themselves on their "art,"
though primarily as teachers. but they are not a standard i judge myself
against.
having language as a medium makes poetry the most populist art, the art
with the most unskilled practitioners (though language as a positive energy
is beneficial to all who deal with it openly,) and is the least likely to
recognized as a high art in these times when value is dependent on either
mass investment (spectacles) or one-of-a-kind collectability.
Perhaps in a world with much more eaully7 distributed capital poetry could
come closer to subsistence value.

Some poets are forced into publishing a book simply because they never have
any chance to read their work if they do not have a published book.

If the book cannot sell, lacking a distributor and any promotion by those
who know how and have the means to that (because they are distributing and
promoting many authors and many books, as well as having connections), then
the book itself is "promotional literature". After all, it is not
publishable for profit.
It is only the promo for the chances at doing readings.

Not that the publication of a book gaurantees worthwhile readings, but it
inevitably gets the author many more readings than would otherwise be possible.
Not necessarily to the right audiences, or to anyone who has the connections
and pull to make the author more successful, but nevertheless, some
audiences rather than only the four walls and one's own voice talking to
those walls......

i've much enjoyed this stream of discussion (so much so that this usual
lurker is responding twice), since its a long-standing issue in my life,
when i need to remind myself that theres value in this poetic path despite
all evidences (monetary, pnaitonal publication, et al) to the contrary. (i
have mfa and ma, butve never had a teching job, and support myself working
fulltime for Oregon DMV).

this poem was written (tho i have much trouble writing intentionally or on
a given subject) as part of a collaboration between visual artists and
poets. i'm working with the (fantastic) painter rick austin. the works will
be the july exhibit at quartersaw gallery here in portland (OR).

A lot of parallel tracks in this discussion.  Doesn't "professionalization"
of poetry in school or criticism parallel what we (especially me) do on

the sense though after reading a lot of the messages here on this subject

& Ron Silliman's messages were parallel - writing, reading & poetry
merge somewhere with living (Cold New World), & that

"Scientists usually assume that only their data and theories matter for
scientific progress, that how they talk about these data and theories
does not matter, that it is irrelevant to their actual work. but in
introducing this particular way of talking, the first generation of
American geneticists provided a conceptual framework that was critically
important for the future course of biological research. To capture both
its rhetorical and conceptual force, I will call this way of talking the
"discourse of gene action"--a discourse that was, for genetics,
undeniably productive. It enabled geneticists to get on with their work
without worrying about their lack of information about the nature of
such action--to a considerable degree, it even obscured the need for
such information. (Throughout the interwar period, American geneticists
routinely invoked the notion of gene action as if its meaning was
self-evident.) At the same time, the attribution of agency, autonomy,
and causal responsibility to genes lent primacy both to the object of
geneticists' concern amd to the discipline of genetics--in their own
eyes and the eyes of others. They were dealing with 'the' basis of life.
If, as Brink wrote, the hereditary complex is elevated from a "passive
object" to a locus of primary activity, the student of that hereditary
complex is, by the same move, also elevated to primary activity...
Watson and Crick have gotten a lot of credit for their work and
deservedly so, but one contribution has, I fear, been overlooked: their
introduction of the information metaphor to biological discourse was a
stroke of genius...Just a few years earlier, the mathematician Claude
Shannon had proposed a precise quantiative measure of the complexity of
linear codes. He called this measure 'information'--by design, the term
was independent of meaning and function--and by the early fifties,
"information theory" had become a hot subject in the world of
communications systems. It seemed to hold enormous promise for analyzing
all sorts of complex systems, even biological systems. Because DNA
seemed to function as a linear code, using this notion of information
for genetics appeared to be natural."---from Refiguring Life: Metaphors
of Twentieth Century Biology by Evelyn Fox Keller

Thanks, Karen and Joe and Ron.  Perhaps I can now restate my concern,
ill-expressed the other day, more clearly: how, having racked up debt to
pursue BA, MFA and PhD, I want to believe, Okay, job market (or, for others
perhaps, poetry market), payback time--only to greet the frustration that
ensues given the market conditions.  I've seen several poets enter the MFA
program with the _expectation_ of a job teaching poetry on completion--it's
the actual expectation, and how it seems to have affected these poets as
writers, that concerns and saddens me.

Standard does indeed make a lot of good points....

I do feel that the emphasis, though, for me, is not on putting down folks
for linking money and poetry..It is more interesting to see how they are
connected.  The very twisted angle at which our activities connect to the
the bizness of amerika (which is bizness) is *constituative* of much of
the work we are doing.  Thus a mag like kenning or MProj. is part of an
overall structure of projects, that often shape poetry practices
themselves; guerilla focos on the grassy plains of the margin.  As always,
the art-world is in the hands of people with ambiguous and shifting class
trajectories, by the way: and Standard's "dominated part of the dominant
class" is not quite on-target: the dominant class owns large-scale
capital; poets are working or (precariously) middle-class, not
capitalist-class (usually; there's always the occasional James Merrill).

Not to dismiss concerns like Katy's about how people (who start poetizing)
will get by, day to day...But that after all is a struggle for *most*
people in the income-polarized nightmare of reagan/clinton type
capitalism. Somewhat more fascinating is the forms poetry has to take to
flourish as the most undercapitalized of art-activities in a late
capitalist market world..(--it takes strength, for one thing, from already
being "pre-rejected"...They wouldn't *let you* sell out, if you begged
'em, because market values have no place for your work and your
engagements:  this makes for interesting undertows of resistence and
self-creation..)

Scott Pound is right:

<<>what or who is Therafields ....

Therafields was a therapy centre in Toronto. bp was a lay analyst for
Therafields.>>

It was a bit more than that though: a community in itself, & one which bp
hoped would be & worked to make a kind of working ideal of community in our
world. A group of communal homes in downtwon Toronto, plus a farm north of
the city. For awhile there (& some of what happened there is to be found
interlined in _the martyrology_) it worked. An ideal of living that also
found its way into much poetry (bp also facilitated a number of writing
workshops for Therafields).

I guess my thought would be that in ANY field, there is not "payback" time to
be counted on. And counting on one if one pursues an art is absurd.

My personal decision has been to pursue living-money in high tech, since I'm in
the Silicon Valley & am a single mom. Happily, the job I have is the best job
I've EVER had, and finally I am able to pay off the MFA debts and many others.
Intially I was guilty about the luxury of having money, but so far it hasn't
changed my work, except perhaps I am more relaxed generally due to economic
breathing room. I was also convinced I would never "fit in." Not true, though I
am considered "creative," which amounts to pretty much how I'm perceived by
family and friends: given to saying odd things & holding strange beliefs. So my
personal freedom remains unchanged. I would point out to anyone on the list
looking for a job that high tech is hardly a closed field to the writerly:
facility with language is in EXTREMELY short supply.

Before this job, I taught for a while, parttime, but am happy not to exhaust
myself in that particular way. My current job is quite demanding & satisfying,
but it doesn't enervate me word/concept/emotion-wise, the way teaching did.

I keep remembering a letter from Clayton Eshleman when I was struggling with a
low paying bookstore job & looking for that elusive teaching position. He
suggested I do ANYTHING (& I recall one of his suggestions was even to find a
job looking after animals at the zoo!) rather than teach. He felt it would mess
up my writing. An interesting tip, coming from a professor. Of course I ignored
him & taught. But he was right (for me). But I'm not going to tell him.

I too have been reading all the posts on $$ & poetry & life & finding a lot
of fine thinking through the problems going on. Thanks to all.

I should have added that for awhile there, in the Therafields experiment,
bp was able to 'make a living' there, doing lay therapy & writing, &
feeling, I believe, that the two were in synchrony not opposed at all. A
life 'in' & 'of' writing? But then, he did follow that line further than
most of us, much further than I could anyway...

actually david this is what i tell a lot of students in our new mfa
program.  and in fact the ones who do get jobs are the ones who go on to
get phd's after their ma or mfa in writing; like you, they're hired on the
strength of their doctoral work, but end up teaching creative writing which
is what they wanted.  of course a lot of our mfa students, for obvious
reasons, don't really want to hear that, since they've already invested
quite a bit of time and energy in this degree program.

There is something worth reminding one's self of.

Poetry has to do with human life, or human lives, as such.
That is far more comprehensive than any academic course of study could ever be.

We might expect that many poets have lived, and live, different lives,
than those people who spend or have spent most of their's within academic
circles, and pursuing not only degrees, but also academic teaching careers.

The academic world is a very different world from all the rest of what
constitutes the breadth and depths of human experiences and those differences
do have profound affects upon every facet of the academic's life, including
the personal. On average they move within different circles, and pursue
different activities, often in different ways, than others.

Of course, some would limit legitimization of poetry and poetics to those
specific instances, of academic achievement and tenure, and thus to those
very specialized, often narrowed, avenues of human experience and lifestyles.

I think there is as much to be said for the importance of poets who do not
have specific academic credentials relevant to poetry, who do not pursue
(for whatever reasons) academic lifestyles, including those who
do not have academic degrees of any kind.

To reiterate Bill Luoma's biannual call for phenomena (objects, dynamics,
qualities) that obsess you, e.g. high power lines, the World Bank,
Myers-Briggs tests, ocean-floor volcanic vents, regionalist prejudices,
injustice, the unjust neglect of great artist zzz, alien stock analysts,
poetry wars, the politically neutralizing effect of pluralism, anonymity,
heat death, nookie acquisition, radiant joy in the form of a soccer ball,
time is a loser, etc etc etc etc etc. My background obsession has been:
allergy, or misbound receptors (faux mots); my foreground obsession has
been: Africa and Asia. Reason I ask: preparing a FALL PREVIEW of what to

Essentially, there is a tax that is assessed according to the amount a
company has invested in certain categories of assets.  For many years the
U.S. law was written so that books in warehouses were not taxable assests.
The law was changed sometime around the mid-1980s I believe.  (I certainly
remember reading about it a lot at that time, when i was in my first
library position involved with acquisitions/collection development, which
was affected for various reasons by developments like this in the
publishing industry...)

Essentially, pulping the books, when they are not selling at any great
rate, loses less money than storing them and paying the taxes accessed on
'em as "assets."  Yes, i believe that giving them away would be
logistically more involved than pulping, and therefore would cost more and
not save the publisher *quite* as much.  True, the difference may not be
great, but the in the scale of capitalist values any difference is vital.

This is a great illustration of the fact that capitalist values are
*opposed* to those of culture and meeting human needs.  Of course, the
books we are talking about here are very often the likes of Jacqueline
Susann, whose print runs are in the hundreds of thousands.  So in that
case we aren't talking about books that meet human needs in the first
place! I don't cry when she's pulped, only when the books are printed to
begin with!

Of course a program should be developed to give 'em to needy poets wish to
use them for aleatory cut-up procedures...

        Mark, well, yes, but what is most useful touchstone in Katy's
original post (thanks, Katy, for inciting so much) was that there IS a
place for (ostensibly) innovative poetries in market values, the magazines
listed that pay are evidence of that.  There are those that read Paris
Review & NYer as hallmarks of taste, and in that light, I find Standard's
lucid rendition of the money creates taste=cultural/economic capital
formula dead on.  Now, Katy should be applauded for working to put out one
of the better magazines (in my opinion) on the "grassy" margins,
Explosive.  As far as selling-out, which is a term I try to avoid, it's
really only useful as a term denoting a sort of acquiescence to the taste
fabricator, that was poorly put, let's call it the wholesale repression of
consciousness.  I think we've established how ludicrous a notion it is to
EXPECT to be paid, make a living (whatever that means) . . .
        The simple fact is that PR & NYer print crap, and that the need to
buy in (precondition for selling out) is greatly diminished by magazines
which are inexpensive to purchase and committed to another sort of bottom
line, where those "undertows" flourish, Mark's Misc. Proj., Katy's
Explosive, and my own Kenning.

Hi Carrie and All:

I don't understand how the conversation about spending money on MFA's got
bitingly shifted to a conversation on the value (or worthlessness)  of an
Iowa MFA. I don't think, Carrie, that you should pity the MFA's at Iowa
because--generally speaking--Iowa funds better than most MFA programs
anyway.  For all the negative commentary it gets (and maybe some of it is
deserved), it's probably one of the best programs you could go to if you
didn't have any money to begin with--the tuition is cheap (if you don't
get a scholarship) & living expenses are too.  And, believe it or not,
there are many people who come to the program without ever having had a
writing community--people from rural areas--hoping that they will find a
kinship in those who do attend.

Ron,

Thanks for the plug re: Mina.  How did you know I *love* Mira Sorvino?  I
wouldn't have thought of it, but I'd be honored to see her play Mina.
There's one part of the book, at least in one version, I'm not sure if it's
still in there, where Mina complains about having had Winona Ryder play
her, the insult of that.

As far as money and poetry goes, Kevin and I go to Ralph, an accountant who
"does" a lot of local poets and rock bands.  You probably know him, Ron, he
used to "do" Barrett and Carla, for instance.  This past year, according to
Ralph, Kevin and I made the most on writing of any of his clients.
(Clearly Ralph hasn't reached into the Amy Tam/MacArthur-award-winners
crowd for clients.)  Even though we had more than enough receipts to claim
a loss, he had us claim a gain on our taxes--BECAUSE even if you earn
several thousand dollars at this, if you get audited, it's a hard battle to
prove to the IRS that this isn't a hobby--as opposed to a profession.  And
part of the money earned was Kevin's California Arts Council Award for
Poetry--how much more official sanction can you get?  It reminds me of when
some poets talk about their parents.  "They'll never accept that I'm doing
something real here, instead of being a slacker."  Neither will the IRS,
either, apparently.

Starting in July I'll be going to the local poets' dentist.  If I gain any
insights there, I'll be sure to pass them along.

Dodie

You may be right.  I think what I didn't make clear is a) most of what I said
comes through Weber, Bourdieu, french Marxists (for whom there is some
autonomy between capital and status-- usually institutionalize)  So I have to
say that the dominated part of the dominant class does not have to have
tremendous amounts of economic capital, but may simply share their values,
etc.  (Here of course there are lots of arguments against "ideology" and
"habitus" and "cultural unconcious")

Trouble wi talkin about it is that it's like making pots or money, you
can't say anything about it until you see what happens, what works.
You can't talk about poetry into existence.

May be the poems lead the way,
no matter what you say.

Every poem is a thing; can't help it, the thingness of it is one of the
most durable fascinating things about the thing.  So if it talks out of
4 or 5 sides of its mouth SOMETIMES that can be a something about it.
A wall, a ship, a pyramid built to outlast the scramble.

O boy.  How many lousy poems come out of that gamble.

What is this embodied something... a way into... health food?
Not the ultra-craftsman Balmont but the paisan craftsman Esenin or
the beyond-craftswomen Tsvetaeva & Akhmatova...

something alive that stays alive? is this personism or Bird-ism? or just sex?

now we have steep politics as always in the US - so does poetry become a
sub-category of rhetoric?  I mean, why do the craft types cluster at
the conservative end of the spectrum - or do they?  I mean do people
enjoy poetry or art anymore for its own sake - I mean the "cutting edge"
people - or does it have to have a civics lesson attached?  That seems
to be where the money's at... I mean civics of some kind - righteous

Having a dual track life, earning money separately from writing and its little
cousins, is EXTREMELY useful for some people.  I knew this very early on about
myself.  The prerequisite which precludes some people from living this way is
a high level of energy.  Discipline helps, just as it does in any life
pursuit.

Hangups about having earned or other money can readily be addressed by making
sure that if you do have resources, you use them to contribute to the
accomplishment of what must be done.

If that's the case, why don't they take a small amount of that cash to
support them until they can get a job in a place where there is a community
of poets? What does it cost for an MFA? How many years in student-like
squalor would that pay for in Paris or Prague, or even NY or SF? (Or
Boston, or Baltimore, or DC or Providence--there are a fair number of
places where poets can be found outside of the classroom).

Behind my modest proposal is the firm belief that it is absurd to expect to
be enough of a poet after a couple of years in school for potential poets
to become one's apprentices. There's a wisdom about the craft, and the art,
that only comes from years, in most case decades, of practice. And what one
learns at school is at best a minor part of this.

I think that this is an interesting point.  I suspect that poetry is a sub-
class of rhetoric among certain "avant-garde" writers who are interesting in
politics or civics first, and then come around to writing poetry.  I feel
sometimes they can only rant rather than enact things in language which might
steer us toward thought.  But why is it I tend to like these folks so much.
It may be a slightly American problem.  This division between craft and
politics.  I'm thinking about the new Sun&Moon international magazine Mr.
Knife and Miss Fork (and also the reviews within) which suggest that other
cultures have always been a little more comfortable (right word?) with this
problem.  Paul Vangelisti's translations of Zanzotto, his reviews of other
Italian writers like Pagliarini and another translation of Zanzotto speak to
this problem.  I like this new project of Messerli's and he suggests often
these days that the answer to "where's the poetry" is everywhere (I mean it is
international...there are people beyond our borders who may still be
interested in art for art's sake but don't shun the vital issues that it
raises).  I don't know how else to put it, but to say that recent translations
of Gionvanna Sandri (Guy Bennett's Seeing Eye Books), the recent Raddle Moon
contain some of the most exciting, provocative work without dogmatics, civics
lessons, etc.

I think my original point stands, Patrick:  it is a *structural* truth
that the overall shape of poetry, A. is not supported, financially; and B.
double-marginalizes work that is formally of any interest or energy.  I
honestly don't see what the existence of payment from a few major
establishmentarian publications does to qualify this....My analysis is
mainly about the broad shape of the poetic "career" (the very fact that
such quotation marks feel *required* in this context, says all).  I don't
think anyone for a second thinks that payments from Grand Street or the
Paris Review have made a substantial difference to the living situation or
overall work-choices of any poet on this list.

My point is that poetry as an activity stands outside most of the forms of
funding art-activities have..And that this has interesting ramifications
for the choices people make in their work.  Much of this thread has
proceeded as though there were the *possiblity* of getting major support
for the actual work itself.  My analysis of the structure of art-marketing
and art-funding, is that poetry for a fascinating array of historical
reasons has gotten less grant-funding than other forms, and is less tied
into the capitalist marketplace.  And the stopgap approaches that have
evolved, rather clumsily, to support individual practitioners, such as
teaching, are of course not precisely full solutions...At least, that's
the impression I get from quite a number of friends who are poets who
teach: not that they don't love and value teaching, but it is not really a
form of support for the work; its pressures can apparently be as bad as
those of any job..(this of course is becoming far worse, as all rights,
job-security and decent pay vanish for the young academics now entering
the universities, who are overwhemingly facing adjunct positions at
poverty salaries).

...er, didn't you notice that my use of "selling out" was not exactly
serious?  I bring the phrase up because it is useful to demonstrate how
much this is a matter of *structural constraints*....In such a situation
compromise isn't really an option, unfortunately.  Thus my point that they
wouldn't "let you" if you begged 'em:  poets have nothing the capitalist
market (and its periphery, such as academe) WANTS.  These are so to
speak the working conditions that apply....

Mark, not sure how you see my remarks tied to American Individualism.

I may have made myself less clear by adopting the language of Henry Gould (as
I was responding to him).

I'm really talking about a number of recent poets who like Whatten, for
example, talked all this communism up in the early days and then edited out of
their collected works when they were reprinted.

I do think there is sometimes a civics lesson that turns up in poetry these
days.  It bugs me most when it is the purely an intellectual civic lesson:
poems which ostensibly tell you why the Bell Curve book is bad.  The other
ones sometimes disguised as meditations on pop culture (pop culture is only a
problem for intellectuals, I might contend).

 Also I was addressing the suggestion by Henry Gould that there is a divide
between the CRAFT people and the POLITICS people currently.  I suspect that
anyone in any MFA program might be able to confirm this for us.  Plus, there
is the legacy of the deep image (still alive and well in people like Forest
Gander) which seems to me to show an idealistic, individualistic residue of
our forefathers who cast all that romantic, nature oreinted talk in terms of
rights, liberty, blah, blah.

It might interest you, Mark, to see my interest in international poets in
regard to politics because of the way labor has status within political
parties.  Union are often political parties.  The merger between poetics,
politics is more clear as I think it was Jordan Davis or someone recently
suggested: because the poets lives are at stake and not just their pocket
books.

Recently learned, it might also interest you, that the first line of the
Italian constitution read like this:  Italy is a nation founded on work...

whereas we are nation founded on what?  that all men are created equal?  Don't
you think this kind of idealism is a live and well in some US poetry?  Maybe
you don't get those submissions to Misc. Proj. but here with Rhizome I get
plenty.

Mark:

I agree that poets should not necessarily look towards MFA programs for a
sense of community.

But they do.  Carrie said "Can't figure out any other way to find a writing
community?  I don't buy it."  Well, whether or not one buys it, it is a
reality for a few people who aren't living in "hip" towns and cavorting
with the hipsters of the poetry scenes outside of academia.  Many of them
were encouraged to write by a teacher/professor and probably also led to
believe that their opportunity to find other people with similar interests
was on this  very specific track.  I was also trying to say in my previous
post that these possibly "disenfranchised" writers actually do fare well
at Iowa, accruing little or no debt.  They are given the opportunity to
write and be in the company of other writers with little strings attached.

Poetry communities can be very difficult to enter if you aren't lucky to
live in an area that fosters a community that grows 'together.'  And you
might still find that a community that you've found is not a community
that you want.  (Whether it be at an MFA program or in Prague/Paris/SF/NY,
etc.)

or pop culture (just intellectuals?) or just the thing, just the thing,

precisely desiring machines, can't be bodies without organs, without

thats an obsession. at least after the isp is paid and electric is on

With some exceptions. David Eggleton, a NZ poet known for his ranting
performance style and capitalist-baiting (was it Ken Bolton who wrote of
him that he's unlikely to have someone stand up in the middle of a
performance and say "As a yuppie, I have to disagree"?), has just done a TV
ad for Honda. "A poem is an object, a rough diamond ..."

And even if you _do_ live in a place with a thriving poetic community (such
as Wellington) it can be difficult to become a part of it. Especially if
one's background, education and workplace are not oriented towards the
arts. Most of my friends and colleagues are great for drinking Lagavulin
and watching Jackie Chan movies with; not so good for recommending a good
translation of Baudelaire.

One can always hang out with the open mike crowd, but if one is interested
in more challenging and (loaded word) "thoughtful" writing, then it can be
hard to be taken seriously unless one has done the right course. Many
events are only ever publicised on varsity noticeboards.

Which is why I'm so grateful for the net, and for this list above all. I
may have been in lurk mode for ages, but the chatter on this list keeps my
mind fizzing amid all the workplace talk of Project Management
Methodologies and Rich Feature Sets.

Amen to both comments (from different folks).

I wandered in the wilderness for many years.  The community was here all
along (although back then very very small) but it was shy and didn't know
how to respond to someone who knew nothing except that there was something
else to know.

Subject:      Skivvues Lesson

My obsession tonight is with finding the formula that will allow me to
umbra-ella all these pol-poet money issues & shut myself up at the same
time so I can worry about money more.

So here it is, robot guys & gals:
VOICE.
You mean - deep throated Galway Kinnell or something?

What I mean is, we can coagulate about various political realities & styles
as we chat along here, but lyric poetry is about a voice that takes command
of the present within poetry in some fashion.  We can groove on somebody's
quirks (Scalapino's) - that's a start - but only a start.  The idea is to consi
der voice - the speaking/singing voice of a certain individual poet (this is
where the Individualism/Community chorus gets the hook, off-stage you go)
- as a kind of testament, like Villon's testament or Dickinson's.
That is, the biz of craft vs. civics is the PROBLEM of the voice & the voice
is the solution.  Now in America & in school general (I mean trade school)
we try to come up with a formula for this or a set of procedures.  Good
luck!  "Lengthen your line a bit - no, that's too far, you're going
Jeffers - cut the Vachel Lindsay pterodactyls - okay, okay, now you're
getting it - yeah!  A Whitman short poem!"

Hah hah.  The antidote : read one Akhmatova.  Now that was a voice with
a Person behind it.  And a Poet.

So we start to talk about how THIS PARTICULAR POET calibrates the brevity
of a poem - the intonation, the triple entendre, the changes, the
modulation, the sound, rhythm, diction, syntax - and comes across with
something that either blows our minds or puts our heads together again.
That's a voice - not "voice" -
A voice.  A river.

Once we identify some of these - then we can even start acting like real
Critics! - we can see where they tried to start to sound like themselves -
we can see where it comes across as inauthentic or sloppy or lazy or
complacent etc.  And the interesting thing is that these weak points
will probably be political and stylistic together... - OR different
in an interesting way...

I stress interesting and well-read & informed & homeworked as opposed to
the usual theoretical blowharderie of which I among many am vociferously
GUILTY.

For the record, I found my first writing community in Normal, Illinois, in
its pre-Dalkey Archive (and well pre-MA in creative writing at the state u.)
days.  It is not necessarily a reality for people who aren't living in "hip
towns" to look to a university for a writing community.  I'd see that
someone in a 100-mile radius had published an interesting poem in a journal,
and I'd write or call; I'd find homemade books by locals in the Waldenbooks,
buy the books, and seek out the writers; there'd be a rare (once a year?)
poetry reading.  I've also had other locals (admittedly within that 100-mile
radius) see my work in a mag and come meet me in Normal.  Even in my first 6
years in LA, the writing community I participated in was entirely
unconnected to a university--or to any "hipsters," for that matter.  Sure,
it took more work to find a writing community in Normal than it since has
anywhere else, but it's do-able--writers are EVERYWHERE.

I also have no particular attitude toward Iowa--I've just heard only
complaints about the financial support there from a number of people who've
been there in the last 5 years in both poetry and fiction.  I'm glad to hear
that it's not that way for everyone.

Responding to Standard:  all I can say is, if you gonna talk the talk
you gotta walk the walk.  I wrote about this in an insane misunderstandable
way in Witz ("The Sense of Being Right").  There might be a way to be
"righteous" without lecturing to others about it; in fact, it might
involve shutting up sometimes (I should give that some thought).  Then
the vicious voice of the poet finds a balance between beauty &
justice which is... gracefulness.  Righteous, not self-righteous.
Singin', not rantin'; hollerin' not squawkin'; preachin', not pissin';
callin' to account, not checkin' the accounts; etc.et.c Lawdy, we
think we knows whut's best - we us, the blinest of th' blin'!!

But there is no righteousness.  The earth is a chorus of groans.
the voice of poetry goes into birds, oceans, imaginary friends,
only to simulate the righteousness of children.

UPCOMING RELEASE (available soon):

*  Brion Gysin  "Poems of Poems"  LP     some of the most important
experiments in cut-up and recording technique by the famous poet and
artist.  originally recorded in 1958 at the historical Beat Hotel
in Paris.  "Language is an abominable misunderstanding which makes up a
part of matter.  The painters and the physicists have treated matter
pretty well.  The poets have hardly touched it.  In March 1958, when I
was living at the Beat Hotel, I proposed to Burroughs to at least make
available to literature the means that painters have been using for
fifty years.  Cut words into pieces and scramble them."  40 previously
unpublished minutes of hypnotic, pure cut-up, only the voice of the
author plus background noise from the Uher 4400 reel-to-reel recording
machine; a fabulous, minimal piece of history.  "What to do with all
this all?  Paste it to the wall with some photos and see what it looks
like.  Wait, paste these two pages together and cut in the middle.
Paste it all together, end to end, and send it out like a big
piano-roll.  After all, it's not but matter. There's nothing sacred
about words."  edition of 630 copies. Alga Marghen Italy G 8VocSon021

AVAILABLE NOW:

* Brion Gysin "One Night @ The 1001" 2 CD $17.99 in 1954, Brion Gysin -
writer, painter and favorite collaborator of William S. Burroughs -
launches his 1001 Nights club in Tangier. in his mythic restaurant, that
stayed open only a few months, Gysin invited the best traditional
Moroccan musicians to perform all night long. the first CD of this
document is what the lucky Western and Moroccan customers of the
interzone could hear at the time: a varied selection of pure
traditional and trance music (along with other Joujouka master
musicians, Bachir Attar's father). a decade before Brian Jones brought
this timeless music into the world, this unique document was recorded by
the inventor of the cut-up method himself. it has been digitally
remastered by Brion's recordings heir Ramuntcho Matta. included is an
exclusive introduction by Paul Bowles. the second volume of this double
CD document is based on a spoken word tape called Dilaloo, which is a
precise decription - written and read in 1956 by Brion Gysin 'Master
Brahim' himself - of an initiation ceremony in the village of Jajouka.
Ramuntcho added a quiet electronic music background generated by a
computer algorithm programme that he created in Gysin's random
permutative spirit. Sub Rosa Belgium SR142

Subject:      1 more on voice

"Her life experience could do nothing but follow the voice, permanently
lagging behind it, for the voice was overtaking events - after all, it had the
speed of sound.  On the whole, experience always lags behind anticipation.
    "Yet the issue here is not only that of experience lagging behind
anticipation; it is a question of the differences between art and reality.
One of them is that in art, owing to the properties of the material itself,
it is possible to attain a degree of lyricism that has no physical
equivalent in the real world.  Nor, in the same way, does there exist in
the real world an equivalent of the tragic in art, which (the tragic) is
the reverse of lyricism - or the stage that follows it.  No matter how
dramatic a person's direct experience is, it is always exceeded by the experien
ce of an instrument.  Yet a poet is a combination of an instrument and a
human being in one person, with the former gradually taking over the
latter.  The sensation of this takeover is responsible for timbre;
the realization of it, for destiny."
- Joseph Brodsky, "A Poet and Prose"  [on Marina Tsvetaeva]

A couple things about this passage.  The first & last few sentences
zero in on why the voice phenomenon is central.  The other point is
that Brodsky, a born popularizer, does a funny thing in this passage
that you find often in his work.  He uses outrageous hyperbole (art
always exceeds any real world experience) in order to describe something
to a general (generally non-poet) public which is actually MORE
EXTREME (hyperbolic) than he lets on.  Poets and insane people
understand this submission to the "instrument" as fate and inner
superreality; but if Brodsky let on just HOW uncanny this is, no
one would believe him.

        Listmates, dont know about you, but I will always read any post
with oops in its header. Oops, most poetic of titles. The lack of intention
upon me (if I can resolve with myself that the writer be not disingenuous)
that Oops would assure me of, feels so . . . trustworthy. I feel I may
learn something. Now I recall being intro'd once (on Hornby island) as "The
poet of Ooops"--the introducer had turned over two pages at once. It was a
delightful mistake, but I think she took my laughter to be mocking. No, it
was the slight shock of recognition that snuck through. d.

There is no money in poetry. The commodity is prestige and influence.
That is exchanged for teaching positions or generated therefrom. But
there are also a few like Al Purdy and bill bissett who lifeart money
somehow. Not easy. Not for me. But they do it well, incredibly well.
Gerry Gilbert in a different way. MacEwan. Leonard Cohen via music.
Phyllis Webb via real estate...

This is primarily 'canadian content':

An institutionalized avant garde is:

Proof that you can change the system within the system;
One of the more bizarre consequences of nationalism;
A contradiction in terms;
A testament to a nation’s committment to excellence;
Necessary;
Inevitable;
A liberal conspiracy;
A conservative conspiracy;
Coincidental with the end of art;
The life of art;
A good argument for garrets;
A garret for good arguments;
Dangerous;
Tame;
The unwritten Brave New World;
Bureaucracy in the service of art;
Art in the service of bureaucracy;
A noble union of art and bureaucracy;
A machine with decision procedures;
At odds with market capitalism;
Intent on revolution;
A co-operative of artists.

jumping in with carrie, summi, markp, standard, patrick et al.:

carrie wrote about "payback time...and the frustration that ensues *given
the market conditions*...," my emphasis, cuz this is quite the point.
and i think mark is right on: that this plagues us *all*, mfa and non-mfa
alike, normal iowa city nyc "hipster" alike as far as i'm concerned.  and
again mark is right on in saying (if i may splice these gems together)
that the "interesting undertows of resistance and self-creation" call
precisely for "an overall structure of projects."  capital knows no
payback.  and i think no single project is enough: any project must be
ventured with an acute awareness of how it can situate itself (yes,
agency!) into the overall structure: go to university, drive across the
country to find a chapbook, work in high tech, do lay therapy in a farm
north of toronto, and hell maybe somebody will climb the random house
corporate ladder and actually convince the ceo to cut 50,000 bucks off the
top once a year and put it towards publishing some non-mainstream poetry
titles too.  find yr community, it aint where you are its what you do
and what level of awareness you can do it at...

>Leonard Cohen via music.

As much as I enjoy Cohen's offerings as they are, it would be extremely
interesting if he could untangle his tongue a little, and express some
of the so obviously repressed creative materials a little more freely.

In one interview, some years ago, he told the interviewer that he is
made to agonize about each word he writes.

I am sure some of us have had similar experiences, and understand the
conflicts, but it is the overcoming of some of those potential influences
that might be the larger challenge.

We might hope.....

Of course.

There is no true dualism of matter and mind. It is all matter. It is all mind.
That is the key to understanding how life began. There is no beginning,
as first instance. Information is already acquired and utilized, in rudimentary
ways by what we traditionally define as "non living" matter. Similarly there
is no true dualism between body and soul. This is simply another way of
expressing the false dualism between particle and wave.

        Now that is what I call painful. And true. ... yes, yes.  And yes
how true. Poetry is pre-rejected - at least certain kinds, adn certain
types of poets are 'pre-rejected' Robert Frost did okay, and so did
Delmore S for quite a long time. Till he drank it all away... there is the American
poet Wallace Stevens who did quite well among the middle class, and was
quite a successful poet in his time. And W.C. Williams the good doctor
earned a good living and wrote all his life... But I think that Katy's
argument no less interesting for all that. Fine poetry is pre-rejected,
but the economics of poetry are certainly as important and no less
difficult than the lives of so-called ordinary people and their daily
struggles to make a living. I don't know if there is an average when it
comes to this type of thing, but I'd say that the cultural worker's
contribution is harder, more demading and carries no insurance policies
that I know of. Not here in Canada, or the U.S. and in the good old
U.S.S.R well being a poet wasn't  a matter of being paid, it was  a matter
of being imprisoned if you said the wrong thing.

And I think that poetry is more important than making cars, or advertising
or building space shuttles... Having said that I still like the space
shuttle but it would be nice if Poets got paid. And poetry got paid. And
if the cool count of words added up to dollars and cents.
I think it is awful and not just sad that poets have to squeak about
salaries. And I don't think they are just like everyone else. At least not
today.

Ey, Vin, heppy Bloomsday nal while we at it wit de idiomts...
Yknow Akmet's pal Isay Berlin talk about thuh Fox an the Hedgehog wull
I about as Hedgehog as they come (long wid Listhog), cause whens I
reads the end of Requiem evr time I gets the physical chills uppa spine
yknow an then I knows dis ending here of dis poem is the greatest poem
of 20th cent. maybe of all time... an thass juss one examp of how a
Hedgehog getta crush onna cert writer an all an then iss curtains fo the
rest like Akmet getta crush on Pushkin soze like she spen pract a lifetime
juss goin deeper into it, now whats I love about Akmet & Almondstem
way beyond Kleb & Kharm (tho I likes them A LOT) is the same thing I loves
about Zhdanov it's the MUSIC man, it's the HEART-MUSIC, when you gots
dis correlations of images & a story & a sly thing goin on meanwhile
juss a simple tune playin with simple words alongs a line that what I
love an it comes outa thirst an hunger man like you know all the NOT-POETRY
world that you gotta walk da walk eventually gives you dis basic THIRST
f'dat music an that is a simple ting that a lotta younga poets are onto
but then a lotta younga poets are NOT onto because they in it all day long
too much know what I'm sayin?  So it gets mighty political rhetorical
sophistiy-clever intullectchall ya know like throw in a big word here
an a lil radical experience here an presto hey this is one cutting-edge
poet man an I say ey juss gimme that MUSIC man that develop an surge
into high heaven like Tsvetaeva & Akmet & Mandel got that SURGE man
maybe it eastern orthodox icon or somethin but it come across so
thass one thing I like about it plus I juss LOVE the mystery games
Akmet & Mandel play wid a line stole from here an meaning about 20
diffunt things without bein obvious about it I dig that now if you wanna
see whut I do wid all this stuff I love well you just hop on down to the
new non (http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~moriarty) cause I got a few lil
jingle examps there wheres I take some ver Merican material histeria
wisteria an I puts it troo a Mandelstam octet like wid rhymes an all, see
#1 I do there is like almost a direct steal whiles #3 come outa the
film version of "Oblomov" an so on juss for an examp now theys a few more
a these comin out in Talisman next but you will see how diffent they sounds fum
all the other non people an mostly they sound like TV ad jingles done by
Celan but anyways thass what it all about...

I think, with many highly-influential albums, books of poems
and prose poems, two novels and a Roshi, Laughing Lennie has been
quite free with his expression. The air might be thin on Mt. Baldy,
but the groundswell shows no sign of abating. And as for the agonising
over words... he has been intentionally esoteric when playing
the interview game, but so has Richard Wilbur ("someone looking down
on me from above, as I sit at a card table in the sun staring
at a white sheet of paper, could be forgiven for thinking I was
in a state of severe catatonia"), and others in the Paris Review
& Parnassus interviews. Some of us lay words down with a trowel,
others, like Bunting & Cohen, use a chisel & blow powder
from the stone before the next word is revealed.

Standard,

Your long reply to my snappishness, clarifies immensely...Thanx.  Sorry to
be so snippy.  That you mention specific poets helps; i can get more of a
grasp of what we're talking about...

Lots of good points in your reply (not all of which are worked thru, and
about which one could quibble slightly here and there; but basically i'm
in agreement).  Well done & thanx.

Carrie, I never said I thought it was "necessarily" a reality for people
living in rural areas or in disenfranchised areas to look to the
university for a writing community.  All I'm saying is that they have done
so in the past--and not necessarily without success.

I encourage everyone to do these kinds of things--to get themselves
involved.  But many of us don't always know where to start.  It's obvious
that we (the ones on the list) have done some searching in order to
find each other.  If you're out of the loop, then you're out of the loop.


Oh--and by the way--I happen to like hipsters, even though they are
hipsters.

And then, Allen Ginsberg was similarly doing ads at the very end of his
life, when enuff decades of notoriety had made him a "celebrity" in a
sufficiently bankable way....

But these are exceptions that prove the rule, i think..

Anyway in the Ginsberg case, it truly reinforces my point: AG was
useful because he had become that neutral colorless odorless substance
that constitutes all mass culture under late capitalism:  The Celebrity.
Yeah i know, in reality and for most of us here he was still anything but
colorless.  But for the World of Marketing he was another undifferentiated
"personality."  The idea that he was a poet was equivalent to basketball
star/rock singer/former presidential candidate, etc. An abstraction that
it was assumed most of the buying public would be indifferent to, so long
as he was known to be famous.

FWIW, Ginsberg donated his fees for appearing in the Gap khakis ad to the
Milarepa Fund, which agitates for Tibet.

Patrick,

i see what you mean about what you call Jorie Grahamesque poets who can
get some $....

But...but..i understand that to you what she can get in the way of grants
and prizes, relatively nice teaching jobs, etc.  may seem like quite a
lot, and desireable....**to me too!!**  it would be nice to have a few
goodies..

But my structural analysis is really about the place of poetry-activities
in the general culture and economy, and really (i would argue) it isn't
weakened by the fact that a few mainstreamers have prestige and income
that's way above most. They still have fame and money (insofar as the
latter comes from their work) that are way down in the scale of
finance and resources our society doles out...

More to the point is the fact that very few poets (no matter how tepid and
conservative their work) ever achieve those exalted heights.  It is very
different from the specific place occupied by various genres of theater,
film, fiction, music, viz art, where there are guiding myths of adulation
and big bucks awaiting the industrious... And the possiblity (tho even for
them, not easy to achieve in today's economy) of scraping by till then..

Then, if i'm right about the specific material character of "the
marginalization of poetry," this has interesting echoes in the way
publishing formats, performance spaces, etc. get invented and mutated, and
the way these become inseperable elements of the work itself..

Despite equivalent efforts to those of other makes as to economics and
quality, the Honda Motor Company has largely lost its battle for popularity
in the North American market. Has that something to do with it ?

What about the argument that advertising / marketing has a greater right to
use of language than poets have ?  I have actually experienced that form of
persuasion. So I know it happens. In fact also the argument that advertising
/ marketing of other products has precedence as to usage. That specific
words, once identified with specific products are no longer as available for
other uses as they were before a coporate take-over of language claimed
specific words as corporate assets. In particular common words that serve as
jingos, slogans, and trade-names, and have become commonly identified with a
specific product.

Duz All of you understand that Tide of Cheer thinking ?

An example of the deter-gent of poetic usage.

 No sorry the list did not "hash out" what i was refering to at all.....

i am not talking about the hand-wringing that went on here regarding
moral/political judgments.....

i was more interested in the cultural dynamic involved with reducing a
specific person and his activities to the abstract cypher of
celebrity-as-marketing-device-and-commodity;

i haven't much interest in what he did with the money, since unlike many
who participated in the old thread you're refering to, it never disturbed
me much that he was doing it!  it was fascinating that he was doing it,
but, no really, i feel there are larger and more interesting political
fish to fry than ethico-political fretting over AG's advertizing career!!

Not the rushens.

It all began with the rush-Ins.  (Pronunciation is everything in this game.)

That was quickly twisted around by the Christadelphians, into some kind

sudden virulent attacks of cult jamming.......

Little enclaves of academia, following the ancient tradition of far flung
monasteries, in the hostile reaches of the empire, notwithstanding. Even
if they do send occassional emissaries to the big sacred cities for audiences
with the holy sees of poetics.....

Does anyone know of an episode, or chapter, within the famous sociological
study of "Middletown, U.S.A.", that dealt with anything resembling Middletown
poetics or, more broadly, Middletown art ?

I do not recall such an episode or chapter. Though I might have missed it
because of its brevity.....

I wonder why that might be.

something in the world analogous to Stalinism now? Does the poetry you
disdain oppose it? Does it oppose it not only with what it says but how it
says it? And most importantly, does it do anything? I hope I'm not giving
you a way out of carrying on this conversation by offering you that last
question. I know that Auden's verdict, that POETRY MAKES NOTHING HAPPEN,
has been invoked on the list recently, but I also think that was what we
may gently call an historical (impatient) remark. The anthologies of poems
on affairs of state, as well as the works of the Russians you admire,
suggest otherwise.

A report from that hipper-than-thou enclave and poetry nexus in Boulder:

Yesterday afternoon, in the Big Tent at Naropa, a panel was convened to
expound on experimental poetry. Moderated by Anne Waldman, the panelists
were: Eleni Sikelianos, Alice Notley, Wesley Tanner, Maureen Owen, Doug
Oliver and Laird Hunt.

Less a busy exchange of views than a series of well-tempered reflections and
mini- manifestoes, the panel was exceptionally lively, diverse and
thought-provoking. Alice Notley began by reading her "Poetics of
Disobedience," (posted to this space previously by Katy Lederer and
available on the Notley author page at the EPC). Disobedience, for Notley,
involves more than a rejection of doctrine and convention. It is both "the
necessity of noncompliance with pressures [and] dictates," and, though she
did not say so directly, the means to attaining a deeper form of obedience
to the self, the self impoverished, or stripped bare, of mental clutter,
outside agitations, and the pervasive and deleterious host of "shoulds"
pressing in from all sides. Alice would chide me for saying so (since I'm
about to bring up a comparison, which she's quite sick of, thank you), but I
kept thinking throughout her reading of Nietzche's idea in _Gay Science_
that we must "obey, at length and in a single direction [so that] something
worthwhile might result, something divine and transfiguring: poetry,
madness, the dance..."

Laird Hunt gave us a stimulating disquisition on the idea of "lineage,"
weaving a renga-like chain of references between Kafka, Hamsun, Bernadette
Mayer, Montaigne, Samuel Johnson, Borges and others.  The stranger in the
book can enter our lives at any point in the text.  Read everything.

Maureen Owen followed by tracing the Western attitude toward knowledge
through 19th Century empiricism to more radical modernist approaches. She
exhorted the audience to dare to be open to form -- to reject the received
and packaged forms of knowledge in order to make ourselves available to the
new, the unknown, the unforeseen.

The celebrated printer Wesley Tanner spoke about the difficulty of making it
new in a form that encourages conformity (i.e. the making of books) and gave
what I thought were two of the best lines of the panel: "Poetry, I think,
saved my life." And: "It's got to be about loving what you do."

Next, Doug Oliver led us on tour of what he called "ideological cliches,"
summarizing the various nodes of the postmodern attack on certainty and
language. He talked about the interface between surface and depth as the
place in language where both play and tragedy occur. And how the older
generation of poets (his) are looking to the younger generation for
inspiration. For Oliver, young American poets (presumably those in the new
Jarnot/Schwartz/Stroffolino anthology) are not burdened by the anxieties of
their predecessors. He made it sound, I thought, as though they were
unburdened by any anxieties at all. Which I don't think is at all true, if
that's what he meant. Poetry is incessantly engaged with the anxiety of form
-- which seemed to me the theme sounded by all the panelists, in so many
words.

Eleni Sikelianos closed the panel with a rousing and lyrical essay which had
previously appeared in "Tripwire," and which explored the tensions between
the eternal, conceived of as static repetition, and a sublime that was
constantly recreating itself. "We must upset the atomic stability of
language." And: "a poem is a suspension of legal terms." That is, it must
defy definition, stricture. She enjoined her listeners not to use strange
syntax for its own sake, "but through syntax to reveal the strange things
that are beyond syntax."

Very surprised there aren't more younger folks out there who found their
teachers for free as I did. Start up a literary magazine, or a reading
series and teachers will appear. For me-- Nate Leslie, Si Perchik,
Laurie Anderson, Paul Weinman, Alan Catlin, Len Roberts, Bob Grenier
etcetera.

As for anarchy, I have an essay called Survivalist Aesthetic in the new
W'orc's Aloud/Allowed on how to make money as a writer with large
caliber weapons, sharp instruments, and blunt objects that might
interest some of you.

Thanks for all the Toronto info. I still owe a few of you notes & am

For myself, I found Forrest Gander through a Web Page I wrote on Frank
Stanford, and for a time he was very beneficial to me.  I also have started
a reading series in Providence, and people have indeed arrived.  Our dear

I was just recently reading a Kathy Acker interview in which she objects to a
characterization of her work as marginal.  She  compares herself to the
Language poets & says that the difference, politically, between her work &
theirs is that she confronts people who don't support her work, that she comes
into contact, for example, with the religious right -- that they actually know
who she is & militate against her, & attempt to disrupt her readings, etc.  By
contrast, the marginality of poetry makes political claims extremely
problematic, though I'm aware of many persuasive arguents to the contrary.
It's interesting to see, however, how essentially "poetic" work in the visual
arts -- David Bunn's recent collaged texts from library catalogue cards,
Lawrence Weiner's stuff, Holzer, Kruger, some of Nauman's & Smithson's things,
etc., etc. -- by situating themselves in the context of "art" -- almost
entirely by that enunciative act alone -- seem to transcend the marginal
status of poetry & enter into the world in a more visible way than poems do. &
this has to do  not only (negatively) with the availability of the plastic
arts for exploitation as commodities, but (positively) with the international
character of the art world -- so ventures like Douglas Messerli's new mag seem
a step in the right direction.  Re: some comments Standard made today --
certainly craft & politics are not antithetical terms -- highly crafted &
aestheticized work -- Mapplethorpe's for instance -- in the context of Helms
attacks, can be explosively political, whereas, for instance, if they had
merely a closeted or marginal audience, their politics might perhaps be
questionable.  Both craft & politics in any case have much wider connotations
than we generally attribute to them.

Alas, Gwyn! I had a headache (I'm taking Laura M's NON 3 for it) and took
crappy notes and so I'm afraid I have little to offer you. But as I recall,
he spoke less of figures in a personal lineage, and more of the idea of
lineage as a kind of circulatory system in which the dead and the living are
engaged in an endless conversation, thus complicating the idea of lineage.
Mayer and Montaigne he juxtaposed in terms of their omnivorous reading
habits and their activities as translators or interlocutors with writers
like Seneca and Tacitus. Maybe he'll publish this piece? It was very
elegant, I thought. I'll try to ask him though I haven't met him yet.

The official Boulder summer reading season got under way last night at Penny
Lane, where Anselm and Edmund Berrigan read to a SRO house. The MC was Tom
Peters. Among the crowd: Alice Notley, Doug Oliver, Michael Heller, Jane
Augustine, Anselm Hollo, Jane Dalrymple Hollo, Jack Collom, Rachel Levitsky,
Akilah Oliver, Laura Wright, Eleni Sikelianos, Laird Hunt, Michael Friedman,
Sarah Bell, Maureen Owen, Steven Taylor, Michael Smoller and the ectoplasmic
form of David Bromige, temporarily OOB, and his magic martini. A cool breeze
did waft...

Anselm Berrigan read first. And I have to say at the outset - I'm shocked by
how young these fellows are. Or by old I've gotten, to be more forlornly
precise. Anselm's reading was carried forward on a wave of dynamic, tricky,
smart alecky combinations: slangy wit mixed with surreal bon mots mixed with
street smart pathos in a rapidily shifting tempo of rhythms. A sense of
continual surprise and freshness.

* enraging the cosmos was easier than I ever imagined
* you can get a medal for running in circles that's intergrity for you
*  you couldn't even talk about subject matter in San Francisco but it was
nice
anyway to take part in a poetics of insinuation

His shorter pieces were followed by a completely hilarious play entitled:
"Intermission: The Autobiography of Katy Lederer in Five Acts." Partly an
account of a road trip by Anselm, Edmund and Katy, it features the plaintive
cry of the heroine: "But I don't want to go to Iowa City!" (For another take
on Iowa City, List folks are hereby directed to Alice Notley's "As Good As
Anything," in her wonderful new _Mysteries of Small Houses_).

Edmund Berrigan read next. His is a more deliberate music. By turns
playfully caustic and sharply, sparsely direct, these poems offered
carefully modulated observations of the all-important minutae of
relationships (and life in general) in a tone of  elegant, dissonant
tenderness. Who knew the colloquial could carry so much melancholy?

* for to take words solely is to miscontruct their origins
* there are some people coming out of tigers with carefully exploded pasts
like babies
* Xnay on the firestarter
* the dinged dept. in you will agree with you
* when strangeness was a childish normalcy

At one point, the poet observed that the shakiness of his hands was
attributable to his birth in a power generator - and boldly called on his
mother to verify this. But the mother - wisely, methought - declined.

As another printer/bookmaker, and poet, I'd be interested in hearing more
about what Wesley said. I met him once, and have seen books he has made on
different occasions. From what I know, I can't imagine him in an
"experimental" forum on poetry or books. I think of the bookmaking he has
done (but perhaps I only know a little of it?) as encouraging conformity
within a very traditional 'fine print' context. I don't think of that work
as engaged with new writing/new forms in ways I would like to see more
active in the field of artists and craftspeople making books.

Iowa is a state school--meaning that it is usually cheaper to begin with.
Then, most Iowa students gain automatic resident tuition if they have a
teaching fellowship, etc (which is the majority of people).  Resident
tuition per year comes out to between 2500-3000/year.  It might even
be less than that.

Also, first year students often receive scholarships--sometimes hefty
ones--that pay for both tuition and cost of living.

(But the "fiction" program is much more brutal.  I've heard that some
people get all funding and some get none. Poetry is more evenly divided.)

Jordan & Henry,

Have you two ever met? You should meet. We could set it up on neutral ground
somewhere between Falmouth and Providence, at a bar on Route 6, and earn the
respect and admiration and endearment of the locals as the poetry discussion
gets hot.

Jordan, don't think I'm still perturbed by your once calling Auden a "crass
fuck," but it does still bother me that this excerpt of his "POETRY MAKES
NOTHING HAPPEN" is still waved around as proof that a) poetry makes nothing
happen, b) poets often believe that poetry makes nothing happen, and c)
Auden was a stuffed shirt who wagged his finger a lot in the face of his
fellow-poets and said stuffy things like poetry makes nothing happen.

After that particular line, what follows follows:

        "it survives
In the valley of its saying where executives
Would never want to tamper, it flows south
From ranches of isolation and busy griefs,
Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,
A way of happening, a mouth"


Placed where it belongs the remark seems less impatient.

Anger may make things happen, but it doesn't survive.

Patrick Pritchett: keep the reading reports coming.

Thanks for your defense of LC.

He _is_ a roshi, yes?  Or at least that's the rumor I heard, that he got
transmission from Sasaki a few years ago.

Even if false, it's a nice rumor.

People Mag did a nice piece on him a couple or so years ago, lots of good

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I have just received from Robert Thurmer, director of the Eleventh
Cleveland Performance Art Festival a copy of the following review of The
Unspeakable Rooms by Amy Bracken Sparks in The Plain Dealer, Friday May 22
1998:

"Those who left after [the featured performance] missed one of the most
stunning performances the festival has ever presented. A stark,
stripped-down, minimalist work, "The Unspeakable Rooms" is an
interpretation of a performance text by sound poet Alaric Sumner, but it
also could have been a year in the dark night of the soul or human Angst
personified.
        "Performer Rory McDermott first made a video of himself in various
positions and movements, which was rear-projected onto a screen, in front
of which he mimicked his 'other', or played off him. The beautifully
recorded audio track began with breathing, as all things do, working up to
non-verbal sounds, echolalias of physical and psychic despair before
launching into the poem itself, which was layered and doubled.
        "McDermott's performance was utterly committed and terrifying,
beginning in fetal position and rising to full cathartic contortions. The
poem was intense and emotional and often obscured by layered sounds or
McDermott's vocalisations. From the hoots and hollers and long applause
that followed, the work by the men from Devon, England was clearly the
favourite.
        "The lesson here. The featured performance may not be the best."

The video is actually front projected.

Otherwise, I am fairly happy with this review!

We are seeking further venues to present this work. It is available in
three versions: as a sit-down performance of either 30 minutes or an hour
and as an installation with live performance lasting about three hours.

Cohen is indeed a Roshi.  has anyone here read his _Book of Mercy_?
I found it to be the most difficult thing to get through of his thus far.
I know it is an older book, but I recently was given a copy and had not
even heard of it prior to this.  Anyway, I found it to be extremely dry,
which wasdisappointing after reading his poetry and some of his commentary
in _Stranger Music_ .

Michael,

"Desire" has become one of those prissy words I find problematic *these*
days.  When Jane Gallop visited SF State (maybe 10 years ago), she talked
about how many feminist books at the time had mauve covers.  Mauve, she
said, was Frenchified pink.  "Desire" seems to me to be Frenchified sex.

Remember last year talking to this fellow who had a book coming out and I
asked him what the book was about and he said, snootily over his beer, "My
book's about Desire."  I kept pressing him, but that's all he'd say about
it.  When the book came out, it was, in part, as I had expected, knowing
his previous oeuvre, about having sex with teenage hustlers.  I'm not
judgemental about that--but "Desire" certainly sounds better than kiddy
porn.

Mina, I'd say *these* days, is about sex and appetite--Courtney Love's "I
wanna be the girl with the biggest piece of cake."  And of course a
desperate search for self-validation.  "Desire" isn't problematic enough.

For what it's worth.

*** German ad withdrawn in row over Nazi slogan

Hundreds of German advertising billboards carrying a slogan
associated with a Nazi death camp were being pasted over on Monday
after an outcry from Jewish groups and the media. The phrase "Jedem
das Seine" ("To each his own"), which hung over the entrance to
Buchenwald death camp from 1937 to 1945, was featured in an ad
campaign in Germany for Finnish telecommunications company Nokia. An
official said neither Nokia nor Gramm was aware of the Nazi
associations of the phrase, which stems from antiquity. Nokia would
paste over the offending billboards with its international slogan
"Freedom of Expression." See

FEATURE-Homeless iguanas roam Los Angeles


            By Sarah Tippit
            LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Here's a real-life Godzilla story:
Leaping lizards lambaste Los Angeles.
            Hundreds of homeless, angry and malnourished South American
green iguanas are loose in Los Angeles.
            Considered trendy pets just five years ago, what were once
cute little lizards -- shipped in by the thousands from Central
America and sold in pet stores -- are growing into 6-foot-long
temperamental pests, as much fun to run into as Godzilla.
            They whip their owners with heavy tails, outrun them, leap
through screens, land in swimming pools, run up huge veterinary
bills and are creating a glut of discarded pets that nobody --
not even animal rescue groups -- want.
            And it's not just a Los Angeles problem. They're fleeing to
Phoenix, building colonies and reproducing in Florida, when
they're not fighting each other.
            Dead or alive, these reptiles could mess up the ecosystem.
Doctors say some carry salmonella bacteria that causes
gastroenteritis in humans.
            Other exotic organisms they may harbor can infect and even
kill off local animal populations, said Diane Lee, of the
Reptile and Amphibian Rescue Network.
            Not since the potbellied pig -- cute as babies before people
realized they ate too much -- has there been such a glut of
unwanted pets, said Russ Smith, reptile curator at Los Angeles
Zoo, which can't handle any more green iguanas either.

            IGUANA: GO HOME
            ``We're constantly getting calls ... from people wanting to
unload their iguanas,'' Smith said. ``I suggest they call any
school that's close by and ask if someone would like to pick up
a pet as a classroom science project.''
            Even the nonprofit Wildlife Waystation -- a final resting
place for failed pet fads from leftover purple Easter chicks to
mountain lions who shredded their owners' drapes and sofas -- is
up to its gills in iguanas and can take no more.
            ``We stopped taking them 30 to 45 days ago.'' said Martine
Colette of Waystation, which recently has adopted more than 100
and is having a hard time finding suitable foster homes.
            The iguanas first caught on in North America during the late
1980s after South and Central Americans in search of a lucrative
cash crop scooped hundreds of nasty-tempered, tick-infested
iguanas out of the jungles and shipped them to the United
States, said Joe Ventura, a wildlife inspector with the U.S.
Department of Fish and Wildlife.
            Their size and temperaments initially kept the demand low
while leather producers deemed their hides unsuitable.

            CUTE BABIES CAN GROW UP AGGRESSIVE
            But breeders, seeking a quick return, flooded the market
with cute little babies that could be carried out of pet stores
in brown paper bags by children. Prices plummeted from $50 to
$75 per iguana to about $6 or $7 apiece, Ventura said.
            Hailed as yuppie pets because they did not require daily
feeding or walking, nobody told new iguana owners that they were
actually very high maintenance.
            For example, the California desert does not agree with
iguanas, which hail from the tropics. So owners either have to
buy a fog machine for humidity or carry the iguana into the
shower, said Liz Baronowski of the Pasadena Humane Society.
            Iguanas also require proper vitamins and diet and light.
Otherwise they develop rickets, pneumonia, or permanent
malformations which make their legs appear to be attached
backwards.
            During their 20-odd-year lifespan, iguanas never stop
growing and require increasingly larger living spaces. They also
get more difficult to handle, and when deprived of affection,
they become skittish and aggressive.
            ``You don't want to see an angry iguana,'' Baronowski said.
His throat pouch inflates, and then ``he comes at you full
board, his tail a lovely little sword.''

            GUIDELINES AND PERMITS REQUIRED
            The Los Angeles Animal Regulation Commission recently
approved a new set of guidelines. They would require pet stores
to inform potential owners that $70 permits are required to
legally own an iguana, and provide other details on care,
handling and potential risks, said spokesman Jeff Prang.
            Discarded iguanas who are considered too cantankerous are
put to death by lethal injection, Baronowski said.
            ``You know there's a real problem when shelters have to
start putting animals down,'' Baronowski added.
            The conclusion? ``Unless you can make a long-term commitment
to an iguana, try a different reptile,'' said Erin Terry, owner
of the Exclusively Reptiles boutique in the Los Angeles suburb
of Westchester.
            ``Get a skink, a water dragon, or a gecko. They don't grow
as large and they will not outgrow their terrarium.''

Iowa isn't so pricey.... pretty much everyone gets some form of
aid--primarily in the form of teaching. Some people get tuition wavers...
and the town is pretty inexpensive to live in. There are a few full
fellowships....

I think the conversation got off track in this instance because someone
assumed that because I was complaining about the expense of MFA programs
and the proliferation of indebted MFA grads, that I was really complaining
about my own situation...

Katy

To one and all:

This money discussion has been a bit upsetting.

That and the fact that I'm staring at 200 copies of Rhizome I'd like to move
(money needed for future issues).  So I'm going to cut the price from $10 to
$6 on the current issue..unless you happen to be an institution.  Those of you
who have seen the magazine might be able to confirm that it is easy on the
eye.  Maybe even slick.

Off the top of my head:  Issue 2 contains Jacques Debrot, John Lowther,
Barbara Guest, Ray Di Palma, Nick Piombino, Norma Cole, Bruce Andrews, L.
Scalapino, Patrick Pritchet, George Albon, Guy Bennett, Paul Vangelisti, Aaron
Shurin, Mac Wellman, Franklin Bruno, Joe Ross, Andrew Mossin, Paul Long, Bob
Crosson, David Bromige, Sheila Murphy, Mark Wallace, John Yau, Avery Burns,
Nico Vassilakis, Ted Greenwald, B. Mayer, Dennis Phillips. Lot of others, Lots
of reviews.  Some artwork by some young LA artists as well as Dennis
Oppenheim.  A couple translations of fiction from Mexico (Fabio Morabito,
Jaime Moreno Villareal).

If you're interested, send a check for $6 to 366 S.Mentor Ave. #108, Pasedena,
CA 91106.....MAKE IT PAYABLE TO S. Schaefer (not rhizome).

Very much hope to recover some money so we can get on with the third issue
which should be very good...lots of translations from France, Chile, Italy.

Jordash,

lately i've been thinking about the big database, the one that has your MONEY-
credit-POWER, and your medical, education, arrests, etc.  and thinking that
there is so much data, how much time will people have to snoop like a need
will develop for people like the database dude in gibson's recent novel who
can just sniff out the relevant patterns.  are you afraid of the ONE database?

i've also been obsessed with the roofs of honolulu houses.  they are made of a
kind of tar shingle with little gray or green gravels, and also very pointy,
not many gables tho, but pointy roofs and they decend low so that it's easy
for a tall person to touch their lower extremities.  rarely there is a roof
that is tiled, but if it is, it is wavy tile and a deep blue; i think it is a
japanese fashion, so unlike the tiled roofs common in mexico and southwestern
us: which to me say the ground the red, etc, but these ones look like the
ocean, the sky. one is next door to me and i look at it in the morning when i
make mango smoothies.

another structure i think about is what i call the "skirt".  it is kind of a
1960s era covering around buildings.  you can see through the skirt and often
these are made of elaborate cinder block style patterned materials.  i can't
really figure out their purpose, other than shielding sun and creating a layer
of air between skirt and buliding that must stay a little cooler than the air
outside the skirt.  i think metaphorically this skirt lets, gives the
appearance of being able to see in (through the holes), of openeness, but
really hides the building and boxes it up.  to me feels like the culture here.
open, laid-back on the outside.  on the inside, hierarchical, highly class-
race conscious, proper, uptight, etc.  i would say about 40% of the apartment
and office buildings in honolulu employ some type of skirt device.  anybody
know anything about 60s architecture?

also i've been thinking how ugly white people are.  and think, oh, i don't
look like the odd haoles i see now and then.  i don't know what i think i look
like.  i'm afraid to think.  like when i go to the beach, what do people
think.  (i've never had a tan in my life)

also i've been buying stickers.  in french a sticker is called an autocollant.

I have a solution: the leather may not be great, but they're a standard
menu item in some countries and are said to be delicious. In places like
Florida where there are feral colonies a hubting season might bring in both
restaurant and tourist revenues.

Brent, is this web page on Stanford still available?  If not, do you need help

By the way, have you read Gander's latest?  It's truly awesome, and I think
that the reference someone made to his poetry as being of the "Deep Image"
aesthetic limits its breadth and power.  It's quite unique, shockingly
unusual, and possesses stimulation for mind, body and spirit--all three at

Summi, thanks for the info.  I had no idea.  How do students without
credentials get teaching fellowships?  I'm pretty ignorant of this academic
world, and wonder...what do they have to teach?  What qualifies them?  How
competitive is the scholarship funding?

Dearest of financially encumbered poets,


This is a luckfest for your vision, a hootenanny of freedom entrenched
within the delicacy of days. This letter could make you 111,110.00
dollars in six-weeks. How many times have you sat in your poetic abode
wishing your credit-card load was low enough to afford a six-month spree
of writing? Or say, it was the fault of the government, their boring NEA
choices sacrosinctly reeking disgust towards supporting your habitudinal
lattice of words. O poet of diesel breathing trees, of cicada swarmed
windshields, of perpetuitous pavement, of trim mothers and fathers, with
minds of winter, with chronic meanings, with eyes of a summer's day:
there is a solution. Only with printing this parchment can this quandry
of sustenance obtaining be quelled.

One evening, I too was measuring the arcane capitalistic starlight
bonding my soleil to the fortune wheel behind the curtain of
post-modernism. I would daydream of living off my art while tasting the
remnants of the wealthy before the overhead rinser at Fontenay
Restaurante as a dishwasher. As my hands hardened with a poverty of
saying throw your skinny body down son, there's hiraganacle handwriting
on the checks of fortune, there's a dumptruck of clams languishing in
the lacuna of epistemological decline.

What you are now holding is your righteous poetic perquisite. The
lauditory lotto for the priest of the invisible. Considering you are a
poet, with poetic friends, you should have some scintillating poems
which you would be willing to sell through the mail for $1. If you do
write poems, and who among us doesn't, you could easily earn over
$100,000 in six weeks. Here's how:

1. Send $1 (US currency) to the progenitor of this idea:
         David Baratier / 345 E. Whittier St./ Columbus, OH 43206
2. Send each of the poets listed $1 for each of their poems.
3. Remove the name which is in the #1 position, move everyone up one
space and place yourself in the 5th position.
4. Make at least 100 copies of this letter and distribute it to aspiring
writers at thriving MFA programs, bars, workshops, and bring copies to
readings and parties for those rarest of people who tell you they write
also.

Since most poets are mathematically deficient, and the realm of science
was taken from our visionary attributes a few centuries ago, let me show
you the way to fiscal freedom:

1. 100 letters will (assuming the poem's excellence) elicit a 10%
response, this is $10.
2. Those 10 send out 100 letters, 100 will send $1 = $100
3. Those 100 send out 100 letters, 1000 will send $1 = $1000
4. Those 1000 send out 100 letters, 10,000 will send $1 = $10,000
5. Those 10,000 send out 100 letters, 100,000 will send $1 = $100,000

For the price of sending out poems to some glossy journal who would only
give you two contributors copies, a pittance for your brilliance, you
can have what you've always desired: the fat fingers of free-time
clacking away on your keyboard. How could your poetic sensibilities
possibly find this offer egregious?

One man became the poet laureate five days after sending out the
envelopes, an ex-president's poems were finally taken seriously and
accepted in literary realms shortly after following this plan, and one
tedious poet was able to stop publishing and writing as a result of this
methodology.

Testimony:

C.K.W. - "The fortune of this plan has enabled me to buy a tombstone
early and start writing about my withering from this point onward."

Helen Steiner R. - "I am now writing serious poems again."

C. S. - "With the wealth of envelopes with influence of wealth I found
no reason to find poets of influence any longer."


Now certain writers have broken this chain. Perhaps you have noticed
their names disappearing at an independent bookstore rate off the
shelves at Borders. Be forewarned, refusal to comply brings a variety of
severities upon the receiver. One woman's literary journal folded
shortly after non-compliance, one was accused of new primitivism in
public, and yet another poet's first book went out of print. Do not
delay, tenure track positions have been lost and found on the basis of
responding to this letter. I look forward to hearing from all of you.

Be well,

David Baratier, Richest Poet in the United States

I have a bunch of announcements/statements here:

first, Bernadette Mayer's "Experiments in Writing," which includes lists =
of journal ideas and lists of writing experiments is now up on the =
Poetry Project web site (www.poetryproject.com), and yes, there's a =
convenient e-mail link at the bottom of the page so you can send your =
own writing experiment additions.

second, Eleni Sikelianos has asked me to post sublet info. Her apartment =
in the Lower East Side (Ridge & Rivington) is available from July 1st to =
August 9th for $1650 plus utilities. I haven't seen it personally, but =
she says it's large, and 2-bedroom, altho sheets will be needed to be =
hung over doorways. If you're interested, e-mail her at =
Sikelianos@aol.com.

third, even more sublet info. Loft on Chambers St in Tribeca from July =
27th to September 9th for $2400 plus phone deposit. It's huge, with =
painter's studio in front, living room, back bedroom, roof with some =
plants. Captures that early 80s feel of rustic artist's loft. Call (212) =
233-6982, or you can e-mail me back about it.

fourth, Jordan's call re: obsessions. Street "furniture"; vendors; pawn =
shop symbols; the inside of pipes, walls, corners; city as energetic =
structure; political relations within communities; purchases and =
counter-purchases; barter and trade; abstraction; confusion--these are =
all "poetic" obsessions and may or may not appear in my fall season. =
Personal obsessions will stay where they belong, in the bathroom with =
all the handwashing and the soap.

best,
marcella

"In perception and everyday experience, we are bound to and limited by
our genetically determined ratiomorphous apparatus--in science we are
relatively free.
Kant failed to make this decisive distinction.

The scope and theory of knowledge extends no further than the objects of
the senses.--Kant

Kant wrote his Critique in order to establish that the limits of the
sense experience are the limits of all sound reasoning in the
world.--Popper

His forms of intuition, categories of experience, and general principles
of factual knowledge were supposed to apply to everyday experience and
also to theoretical knowledge. But, faced with the most successful
thoeries of modern physics, most of those principles turn out to be
false. For the description of nature we do use Kant's allegedly
"universally and necessarily valid" a priori principles. Elementary
particles, atoms, molecules, neutron stars, black holes are quite
different from all those mesocosmic objects we cope with in perception
and everyday knowledge."---from On Supposed Circularities in an
Empirically Oriented Epistemology by Gerhard Vollmer
---
"In a way, sense-datum theorists invent the last link of their
perceptual chain so that it will fit in with the causal-chain model they
think they have inherited from natural science. What the theorists have
not appreciated is that the last link in seeing is not something
detectable(as are the events taking place in the sun, in space, on
earth, and in the human eye). The last link of seeing is itself the
detecting. Trying to treat seeing as something itself seeable is what
leads to the account set out before that so that so offends our common
sense."---from Perception and Discovery: An Introduction to Scientific
Inquiry by Norwood Russell Hanson

I inadvertently deleted the letter before I reread the author, but not
before I wrote down the line, which I submit as
best-out-of-context-line-of-the-week (oh wait, I just remembered: it was
Bill Luoma). Anyhow:

Another structure I think about is what I call a "skirt."

Can I use this, Bill?

Other listees: would you be offended by an appropriation like that? It
doesn't represent the larger concept of Bill's paragraph, which I WOULD feel
weird about appropriating, but how about single prosy lines (vs. perhaps
more overtly "poetic" lines--say, containing a metaphor)?

Appropriation is *my* obsession.

I suppose you would have to search the _big_ database for other possible
instances of usage. You would have to find all those who had made any
previous claims to that seemingly original turn of phrase. You would then,
perhaps, have to obtain their permission, or a waiver as to their
appropriating it first. Only then might you appropriate it as your own.
Should you find one instance of trade mark, copyright, or similar
encumberance, anywhere in the world, you might have to forego appropriation
and hope like hell that you can use it, the way Bill did, without
acknowledging someone else's prior appropriation.

Now, who said that they coined an original phrase ?

Really ????  Prove that it is original.

And remember how many millions of English words are published annually.
(Also including advertising.) Anyone have a word count on that ?  It would
be interesting to know.

What then are the chances of a whole verse of _your_ poem, or a paragraph of
_your_ new novel, being substantively or wholly present in some prior work ?
I wonder what the statistical odds really are. Anyone know that ?

We do not, on average, like to think about such questions. I wonder why.

Gwendolyn MacEwen, not Rod McKuen. I spelled her name wrong. You spelled Rod McKuen's

Actually, _Book of Mercy_ was Cohen's last (so far) book of poems. It got
less attention than any of his others, but I remember at the time being
pleased and interested because (again) he had gone to the work of writing
something he had not written before, and because there was some stuff you
knew you had to come back to, to try to piece out. There was one
intelligent review, by an Ottawa philosophy teacher.

Does anyone on the List know whether anything has been written about Hannah
Weiner's _Code Poems_?
Also, perhaps someone could comment on the relationship between Weiner's texts
& the codes she appropriates there.  Interesting examples appear in the
Rothenberg, Joris anthology.  I've become interested lately particularly in 1.
the relationship between public & private languages in her writing & 2. the
relationship of her work to LangPo --  2 issues that very likely overlap.  Any
thoughts on these things?  Oh, and one more question -- what are the best
essays on her work?

Aviva,

Unfortunately, I had a "falling-out" with Stanford's widow, and have been
working to re-construct the page w/o the poems she has the rights to.  I
have completed the page for the most part and have been donated some 25
Megs of Web Space to post it on, which should be complete by mid-summer.  I
have even added a sound file of Frank Stanford reading his poem _Linger_,
and this is the only known recording of the poet reading his work.

As for Forrest's new book, _Science and Steepleflower_, I think it is the
most brilliant work he has done to date.  I love it!!!
I find him to be one of the most honest, articulate voices in contemporary
poetry, and i think his work does not get nearly the amount of attention it
deserves.

I'll keep you posted on the Stanford Page.

Brent

I understand Henry's & Standard's skepticism about the poet too willing to
classify poetry as rhetoric, or, seemingly more to the point, to write the
poem qua civics lesson, but I also think that there's an important
distinction to be made: if all langauge is fundamentally rhetorical, as
many a good 20th century theorist would suggest it is, then poetry is not
a "sub-class of rhetoric" but rather a particular *kind* of rhetoric which
is good at doing particular things.  Standard suggests that he's
interested in the way poetry, as a kind of writing, provokes thought, & in
saying that he's implicitly using a rhetorical theory of form.  Here's
Kenneth Burke on such a theory as it regards poetry:

"The general approach to the poem might be called 'pragmatic' in this
sense: It assumes that a poem's structure is to be described most
accurately by thinking  always of the poem's function.  It assumes that
the poem is designed to 'do something' for the poet and his readers, and
that we can make the most relevant observations about its design by
considering the poem as the embodiment of this act."


Burke of course is far from a vulgar pol & I find this approach to the
poem, however avant-garde or 'traditional' to be incredibly helpful.

The Burke paragraph suggests it is possible (& fun) to look at a poem
both as an (art) object and as a pragmatic "act".  Such would lead the
Mandelstamian critic to follow that up by pursuing the pre-context,
the "impulse" behind the work, the poetic impulse.  & the Brodsky
quote I sent a couple days ago (before Jordan & I started zinging the slang)
suggested that this specifically poetic impulse is psychically "deep"
and historically "anticipatory" - an instrument (language) with
specifically poetic powers underway.

Anyway, an awareness that there might be a specifically, generically poetic
activity & impulse at work might allow a reader to weigh that in relation
to the political goals of a poet & the specifically political/social
rhetoric serving them.

When I started yelping, where's the poetry?  I guess I was thinking,
where's the singing? with reference to this poetic impulse...
but I've taken this general bullshit line about as far as it will go...
right Jordan?  Read any Elena Shvarts lately?  Julia Kunina?

about US/Russian cultural-political relations...

I am a bit surprised by Brent Long's characterization of _Book of Mercy_ as
'dry,' but to each his own. Is prayer 'dry'? Alas, too often. But I found
_Book of Mercy_ a marvel, not least for the wit, even the black humor,
something too often lacking in prayer or psalms:

                        When I left the king I began to rehearse what I
would say to the world: long rehearsals full of revisions, imaginary
applause, humiliations, edicts of revenge. I grew swollen as I conspired
with my ambition, I struggled, I expanded, and when the term was up, I gave
birth to an ape. After some small inevitable misunderstanding, the ape
turned on me. Limping, stumbling, I fled back to the swept courtyards of
the king. 'Where is your ape? the king demanded. 'Bring me your ape.' The
work is slow. The ape is old. He clowns behind his bars, imitating our
hands in the dream. He winks at my official sense of urgency. What king, he
wants to know. What courtyard? What highway?


Well, I find it funny anyway, . . . not to mention that it seems to connect
to a number of threads ongoing here...

Jacques,

There is an incomplete list of reviews of Weiner's work on the Hannah
Weiner pages at the EPC, see
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/bernstein/weiner.bib.html: the end of
this file has everything I knew about up to the time of her death. If you
or anyone else comes up with additional critical pieces, please let me
know: I know this needs to be updated to include the Poetry Project
Newsletter pieces from last year and Mark DuCharme in *6ix* (can you give
me the full citation for that?), and Maria Damon's recent MLA presentation
(Maria will be giving a talk entitled "Hannah Weiner: Clairvoyance and
Trauma" for the UB Poetics Program on Thurs., Oct. 15). What else?

Hannah would be seventy years old on November 4 and we are presently
working on a celebration of her life and work, to be held at St. Mark's
church -- The Poetry Project. I don't yet have a date, but it will likely
be on a Sunday afternoon in the Fall. When I do have additional details, I
will put out a call for those who might like to participate in this event.

        Yes, and I always thought the realization that that line would
outlive all
        his others is what did him in. S.

        I don't know, Sylvester . . . there's his poem called "Poetics":

        Not many people can do it really well.
        Nobody knows why.

volume of tribute out to him from a new press in Bolinas, Clew - does
anyone know of this publication or this press?)

Gee, Dodie, I didnt know there was anything wrong with frenchified sex. The
Others appeared to like it. It was better than or as good as Nothing.

As myself the author of a book titled _Desire_ I rush to the title's
defense. (1) The title was arrived at in 1987, one year before your meeting
with Jane Gallop  (2) I intended not only Lacan theorizing but also Rita
Hayworth singing "Put the blame on Mame, boys" as well as some juggling
etymology around the phrase "Follow your star" (3) it's a pun on "de-sire",
the necessary oedipal move.

However, Frank Bidart's last book of poems is also titled _Desire_ , and it
came out in 1997, so sock it to him.

The urge to speak and the urge to procreate appear inextricably tangled up
in blues. Even the alphabet shows this, which as we know, in its emphatic
form begins "Fucken A".

I understand that in your desire to distinguish your marvelous book from
asomeone's quick characterization of it (not even that, really ... just a
tentative trying of the water), you likely had no intention upon others'
use of the word. But as we see, I couldn't resist. The urge to kid around
is a serious urge. Desire me to continue,if you will riposte.  db3

        Well, I will indeed confirm that Rhizome is a handsome magazine.
At the reduced price I don't see why anyone interested in contemporary
poetry should let this opportunity pass.  Paul Vangelisti's fierce piece,
Barbara Guest's sprawling lyric, John Taggart's melancholia Americana,
Mark Wallace's quippy stanzas . . . etc.  That's my review.  Buy the
thing & support what is certainly one of the more important annuals
running.  Patrick F. Durgin

I also always find Bill's obsessions inspiring -

My obsessions lately and have been gardening and walking - I've almost never
gardened until the other day when I suddenly began digging away in our tiny
white trash back yard and later bought flowers and put them in pots on our
cement - My experience has been that husbands garden and one goes to the
garden stores with them looking for shade and hazarding opinions - yes get
the pink ones - we need basil - I think of myslf as having a black thumb and
can kill house plants just by looking at them -

Walking here in Albany is repetitive but, unlike my former walking in SF,
almost never uphill - Albany is a mile square - A grid of treed streets with
little houses -  Everyone has a garden - There are lawn dogs, geese,
flamencos, deer, bugs, elves, scarecrows and buddhas -  There are five
garden stores within walking distance - I actually went to Smith and Hawkens
and found myself wanting a faux Roman concrete tub -

BTW - There is a show worth going to at the new Traywick Gallery - Work by
Emilie Clark co-editor with Lytle Shaw of a new critical mag Shark - at 1316
Tenth St. at Gilman by Smith and Hawkens, behind REI - for those who know
the east Bay - not far from SPD -

"Cruz seeks out the most disparate images, ideas, people, and finds in
them confluence, rather then conflict" - quote from SPD's Winter catalog.
This struck me for several reasons, not the least of which is my sense
that  anarchy is confluence after ripping apart rather than just generating
conflict.  Or am I just being naive or is there another word to describe
this?

"art" does carry a cachet that "poetry" does seem to lack.  Is this

A. Not as left-brain (and difficult or unpleasant for many)?  There are
imporant and fun right-brain aspects to poetry.

B. Did not suffer as much in it's "school-days" presentation?  This is not
just a twentieth-century English-speaking sistinction.

C. Snobbism.

D.?

I would hate to think that "snobbism" is the major reason for the

Being situated in the context of "art" does clearly lead to more visibility
(and remuneration), but I've enver been able to clearly understand exactly
why this should be.  Ther are many people who simply don't like to read and
think in left-brain fashion (or have difficulty doing so), but there are
other (important!) elements of poetry which are not left-brained.  Poetry
did and does go through a caldron in it's school and academic presentations,
but art sufferers some of the same presentation woes and the art/poetry
diathesis exists beyond our twentieth-century English-language cave, I
think.  This leaves snobbism as an explanation, I think, but I would hope
that it isn't a sufficient explanation.

Dear Listfellows:

I'm back, after several weeks offlist (the vacation was great, by the
way).  I'm in the process of preparing a literary biography of Louis
Zukofsky, and I'd appreciate hearing (backchannel, of course) from any
listmembers who knew or corresponded with Zukofsky.  I'd also appreciate
anyone who might have them backchanneling me with a few addresses:
        Robert Kelly
        Armand Schwerner
        Hugh Seidman
        Michael Heller
And of course, if anyone knows of any caches of Zukofsky
correspondence/manuscripts outside of the big collections at Texas and
Yale, I'd appreciate that as well.

Wish me luck, and thanks in advance!

Barrett Watten is the author, most recently, of Bad History (Atelos Press,
1998) and the co-editor of Poetics Journal, whose recent issue appears this
spring. His collection Frame: 1971-1990 came out in 1997 from Sun & Moon
Press, and collects seven earlier collections. He is also the author of two
book-length poems, Progress (1985) and Under Erasure (1992), and co-author
of Leningrad: American Poets in the Soviet Union (1992). A recent issue of
Aerial is devoted to his work. Total Syntax, a collection of essays on
modern and contemporary poetics, was published in 1984 by Southern Illinois
University Press. He is currently working on two book projects: Horizon
Shift: Progress and Negativity in American Modernism and New Meaning:
Innovation in Modern and Postmodern Culture. He teaches modernism and
cultural studies in the Department of English, Wayne State University,
Detroit. He may roam far from home, but whenever we see the Oakland Bay
Bridge we think of Barrett Watten. "Welcome back, welcome back. Welcome

Ah yes, all the rich artists. Really, this is not at all the case. True,
there is a high-money art market, and a few (in comparison to the total, a
very very tiny few) artists make some money. But far more that I know
struggle just as much as poets, and studio rent and materials that many (if
not most) artists use tend to be a good deal more expensive than paper &
pen -- plus artists need to be computer savvy these days, too. Yes, if one
does sell a painting, for example, she may receive anywhere from a hundred
to several thousand dollars. Very few, though, sell enough to pay the bills
without taking other jobs, just as poets take jobs, whether it be as
teachers or clerks or waitpersons, or whatever.  And artists' MFA programs
have the same problems, including turning out 'employable' graduates, that
writers' MFA programs have. I do think more people out there in the world
see art every day or every week and are therefore less intimidated by
artists. But then I also have seen situations where artists seem to have a
stereotype of not being very smart -- and truly, I knew one who rather
encouraged this; he would get himself out of any difficult arguments/twists
of thinking by just saying, "well, I'm *visually* trained."

There was a reading at Sun & Moon's storefront in L.A. on Sunday, to
celebrate the publication of the first issue of MR. KNIFE AND MISS
FORK--a new journal, edited by Douglas Messerli, that focuses on
international poetry. Paul Vangelisti read his translation of poems by
Andrea Zanzotto "(THAT)   (IT GROW)"  and Amelia Rosselli (from _War
Variations_--translated with Lucia Re). Julian Semilian read two poems by
the Romanian poet Stafan Agustin Doinas (translated with Sanda Agalidi).
Michael Henry Heim (who just received a PEN award) read from "A
Not-So-Brief Reflection on an Edict" by Miroslav Holub (Czech Republic).
Gilbert Alter-Gilbert read his translation of "Manifesto Mayhaps" by
Vincente Huidobro. Guy Bennett read his translation of Jacques Roubaud's
short essay "About"  in which the poet reads his book _Everybody's
animals_ to a class of third graders. And Will Alexander read his essay,
"The Caribbean: Language as Translucent Imminence."

The journal itself has been mentioned in a couple posts lately, but it
couldn't hurt to mention it again. It's a great new project. Tell your
local librarian to subscribe. And make sure your local bookstore keeps in
stock. $10.95. ISBN 1-55713-345-X

I have not read or seen that anthology, but....."knife and fork" usually
refers to an economic condition where all there is work for food and nothing
more. The kind of mentality where there is no art or culture to speak of,
but if your belly is full of food in the evening after a day of work, it
means there was work to be thankful for, and that that is all that is
possible. That being the same as the phrase:"knife and fork mentality".

It is a condition somewhat uncommon in much of North America, but not quite
so uncommon in many other parts of the world.

Is that the implication in that context ?  Or is it somewhat different
and perhaps more obscure ?

        mANY THANKS FOR THE EXCELLENT QUOTES AND INFORMATION--
        "BEATING THE HEAD AGAINST THE WALL"--Gilles Deleuze in a late
essay on writing wrote about this--that one must beat the head against
the
wall--
        (recall the scene in Raging Bull when Jake LaMotta (Rbt de Niro
beats his head against the wall and realizes:  "I am not an animal! I am
not an animal!" De Niro then breaks his way into language--recitations of
poetry and scenes from plays--on stage "where this bull here can rage")
        the connections between violence and language are interesting--
        many years ago in a country far away I had the opportunity to
throw some anarchist bombs (in to empty police vehicles)--and later moved
on to
graffiti--now writing, visual poetry and mail art--
        anarchism is not purely aleatory at all--
        the great jazz musician Don Cherry often pointed out that to play
Free Jazz one required great discipline
        (Mac Low is in this line--the disciplined thinking out,practice,
study. then the
conjunctions with the seemingly aleatory--ditto with Cage)
        anarchists, pacifist or violent, are suppressed in part because
they call continually into question the norms imposed by societies, arts,
institutions, which create norms and rules that pose as virtuous in the
name of preserving heirarchies which from time to time reshuffle the
names, while retaining the forms--
                "yet the clouds still move . .. "
        chaos theory? Prigogine & Stenders' Order out of Chaos?
        the Eternal Network of mail art?

Perhaps Manuel Brito would like to contact him.( I know his question is directed toward the 1960's poetry scene, but perhaps he could write to him and ask him if he feels like he beat his head against the wall but now is forced to let poetry do it for him?

Yes Karen. go ahead. i was never very good at context.

re: the last time the list discussed appropriation (chip & dale's younger
poets issue) wasn't it "decided" that each of our words posted to this list
were our intellectual property as if printed with the little c circle mark
next to it? i didn't register my disagreement with this general "decision" at
the time.

also i wonder, is it appropriation if you have to ask?

I inadvertently deleted the letter before I reread the author, but not

Other listees: would you be offended by an appropriation like that? It
doesn't represent the larger concept of Bill's paragraph, which I WOULD feel
weird about appropriating, but how about single prosy lines (vs. perhaps

The long-running thread about politics and poetry and their uneasy
coexistence or doubling has reached a very subtle and high level, it
seems to me, with the latest posts of Standard and Mike and Henry and
Dan. I thank them all for their cogency! (Soon it will all be forgotten
and we'll go back to ground zero, of course . . .)

What follows are a few paragraphs from "The Politics of Jacques Derrida"
in the June 25 issue of the New York Review of Books, which speak to my
. . . uneasiness . . . about severing that link.

"Tyranny begins in the language of tyranny, which derives ultimately
from philosophy. If that were transformed, or 'neutralized' as he says
in Politics of Friendship, so eventually would our politics be. He
proves to be extremely open-minded about what this might entail. He asks
rhetorically whether 'it would still make sense to speak of democracy
when there would be no more speaking of country, nation, even state and
citizen.' He also considers whether the abandonment of Western humanism
would mean that concepts of human rights, humanitarianism, even crimes
against humanity would have to be forsworn.
        But then what remains? If deconstruction throws doubt on every
political principle of the Western philosophical tradition - Derrida
mentions propriety, intentionality, will, liberty, conscience,
self-consciousness, the subject, the self, the person, and community -
are judgments about political matters still possible? Can one still
distinguish rights from wrongs, justice from injustice? Or are these
terms, too, so infected with logocentrism that they must be abandoned?
Can it really be that deconstruction condemns us to silence on political
matters, or can it find a linguistic escape from the trap of language?"

(Snip)

        " . . . Derrida is convinced that the only way to extend the
democratic values he himself holds is to destroy the language in which
the West has always conceived of them, in the mistaken belief that it is
language, not reality, that keeps our democracies imperfect. Only by
erasing the vocabulary of Western political thought can we hope for a
''repolarization' or a 'new concept of politics.' But once that point is
achieved, what we discover is that the democracy we want cannot be
described or defended; . . ."

(snip)

        "No wonder a tour through the post-modernist section of any
American bookshop is such a disconcerting experience. The most
illiberal, anti-enlightenment notions are put forward with a smile and
the assurance that, followed out to their logical conclusion, they could
only lead us into the democratic promised land . . ."

I don't claim, of course, that poets have to be "humanists" - Olson also
wanted to dismantle that philosophical system which places humans,
unnecessarily, at the center of things. But I appeal to people with more
of a background in modern philosophical theory then myself to refute
this somewhat - alarming -- description of Derrida's ideas!

When someone suggests that poetry can't or shouldn't be "political" and
then goes on to describe a "pure poetry" or as Henry had it earlier a
"poetic impulse" that somehow precedes "rhetoric," I get . . . a little
nervous!

Deconstruction is not NECESSARILY "lang-po," I know, but Bobbie - has
your machine blown up yet?

Tuesday evening at Naropa was the occasion for one of the more memorable
readings heard by your humble reporter, made so by all there, but
particularly by the presence of Carl Rakosi and the ghostlier demarcations
of Lorine Niedecker. But first things first.

Michael Heller began the evening by proclaiming that "we are all here to
celebrate Carl Rakosi." He then read from his new (and highly recommended
book) _Wordflow_ , starting with "Figures of Speaking."

"The beauty of the older poet's voice
Punishes me.

What is beautiful must
Or one doesn't believe it."

And from "Heteroglossia on 53rd St.":

"The language falls
A chunk of disembodied sound through space."

New work included the lovely "The Chronicle Poet" - "Nothing impedes
thought's passage more than an unuttered word" - and "Meditations on the
Ba," inspired by a sculpture of the Egyptian death-bird the poet saw when
visiting Freud''s home in London. "Imagine if were to awaken to another
language." And from "Diasporic Conundrums"  - "those legibilities constant
with the self ... we are the impossibles of these wants."

Heller concluded with more from _Wordflow_ : "Lecture with Celan," "Without
Ozymandias,"  "Classical Theme," and "At The Muse's Tomb":

"What was truth?

The plangent lucidity, the glass through which the light flowed."

Heller's beautifully calm and polished cadences describe the arc of a rare
and delicious economy. At once grave and uplifting, these poems are serene
meditations on time, decay, memory, loss -- the slippage of language and the
poetics of desire (of eros) to provide or secure some sense of self against
the perpetual undertow of events, of the listing body itself. They suggest,
in the most elegant way, that form is perhaps nothing more than the
enactment of our anxiety about time.

***

Jenny Penberthy took the stage next - and dazzled us all with a multi-media
presentation on Lorine Niedecker. She began by reading Part Five of
"Progression" - hitherto unpublished - it's the opening poem in Mary Sloan's
_Moving Borders_ anthology. This poem, explained Jenny, had languished in
Pound's Papers (collected I forget where). Niedecker had sent it to him
along with a very illuminating cover letter. Pound apparently began editing
them (that got a good laugh) but gave up half way through and  evidently
never replied to her (another laugh, more rueful than the first).

Then came a slide show - photos of the most marvelous book in existence I
should think - entitled "I fly my rounds, tempestuous." It's a 1935 monthly
calendar, bound by a ribbon at the top, in which every page offers some
homely platitude in its center, surrounded by the days of the month.
Niedecker cut and pasted a blank piece of paper over the platitude and wrote
her own poems in their place. (Actually, Penberthy thinks she wrote them
first, then pasted them on). The book was sent to Zukofsky as a Xmas gift in
1934. Here are some samples (I understand some or all of this has been
printed in Sulfur two issues back):

Wade all life
backward to
its course
which runs too
far ahead.
________

To give heat
is within the
control of every
human being.
___________

The satisfactory thing
is to keep revolving.
_________________

I talk at
the top of
my white
resignment.
__________

I like a
loved one to
be apt in
the wing.
_______

Jesus, I'm
going out
and throw my
arms around.
___________

These are poems so good they can move one to tears and beyond that what is
there to say? Except that they are charged with the gnomic - pure oneiric
utterance.

To close, Penberthy played the only known recording of Niedecker reading her
work, made by Cid Corman when she was 67. It includes most of _Harpischord
and Salt Fish_.  And about a minute of an interview he conducted with her
before the vagaries of literary history swooped down and the tape ran out.
She sounded like my Midwestern grandmother - high, sweet, almost dainty, yet
with an underlying exactness as true as steel. And it was a weird delight to
sit in that dark, still, crowded  auditorium, rapt by the tinny scratchy
tape of her voice.

****

That's a tough act to follow. But Rachel Blau DuPlessis did it and did it
with real bravura. I confess at once that she's one of my favorite poets.
Rachel began with a new Draft called "Renga" --- "stand still under the
hemisphere of night" --- "multiple registers that travel to the serif of one
letter" --- "at the edges everything's midrush, midrash" --- "yesterday I
had a diaristic impulse but it didn't work out did it?" --- "oculist or
occultist? Agitated or anointed? Your call."

This was followed by Draft 25 - Segno, from _The Fold_, which she described
as involving a signifyin' on a signifyin' by Oppen. And Draft 26 - M-m-ry,
which incorporates the language of official rejection from the kind folks
who oversee the Freedom of Information Act. All of these motifs working
within the overall practice of citation and self-citation that comprise a
major theme of the Drafts.

"Of living in a landscape whose flaring cries
        are not sound, are
                cries not to be cried
but atmosphere, ache and el,
        their world-renowned interface
to be remembered as such.
        A task deep within restlessness.
                And thus the story, o

the story ---- "

DuPlessis's laddered music, her stepped cadences and sibilants, have a
post-medieval glow to them somehow. Compacted fragments from a lost primeval
bestiary of The Word, rolled into pearled utterance, broken across the page
in pageant -- sinuous recoil and redoubling curve of blinkering sense and
sound. The enactment of form forms the thought of form. A shimmering. Feint
and pump. A lyric rush that constantly breaks form and faith with itself in
order to re-establish itself at a different pitch. Song as question mark, as
rupture, as dislocation and relocation. As re-alottment and recuperation of
the possibilities of song. A decoding of accepted boundaries. And as Hank
Lazer puts it, "an epistemological inquiry." Into thrust ratios, carrier
waves, originary locii and tertiary hinges.

She closed with Draft 36 - Cento (soon to appear in "Chain").  Here the
practice of self-citation figured largely as the plan of the poem involves
drawing every line third line from an earlier Draft. (Cento - a patchwork in
which every line is cited, but at 99 lines in length, also a pun on Cento =
hundred). The poem is scattered with phrases from French, which Rachel
speaks, and from Russian, Hebrew and Esperanto, which she does not.

"Like everyone else I'm attracted to words that end in -ette.
Rockette, majorett, poet."
(And ad lib: "that's for all your girls out there.")

"Inside the unsayable grumble hungry phonemes."

And quoting Rakosi:
"Dazed amid the world, the real world, 'the real real world'."

***
I've now gone on entirely too long, but bear with me a little while yet.

Anselm Hollo introduced Carl Rakosi by describing him "as absolutely
contemporary as ever."

And Rakosi, looking dapper and sweet - he has one of the most beautiful
faces I've ever seen - started out by saying: "When I stand here, I stand
here as a performer. The poet is home in the book."

Following are various snippets from his most recent work (the linebreaks are
mine - apologies to all for my wild surmise):

"Satyricon"
Guess what?
Little pygmies from the business world
have taken over Congress
with a mission to scuttle
social welfare.
____

All that's left is irony,
which is best served like chardonnay,
with cold crab and grilled words.

"Modern Narrative"
By the water of Babylon I sat down and wept
with shoemakers son, Thomas Traherne ...

"Corporate Men"
Maxwell, a self-made man
who loves his creator

Dulcimer, the celebrated poet.
A sheep in sheep's clothing.

"The Ballad of the Diminished I"
Where is fancy bred?
In the quiddity of the sparrow

I looked this up a few months ago, 'cause I didn't know either: a chapbook was
originally any small, cheap book (chiefly pamphlets of popular tales, ballads,
tracts) sold by a chapman -- an itinerant peddler or a boothkeeper at
marketplace. OED sez origins of chap are barter, business. Seems to precede
the US.

I second Charles on this. Some years ago I read that the average visual
artist in New York (the city) who made any money at all (surely the
minority) reported taxable earnings from artwork of $4,500 a year.
One reason, aside from those already mentioned, for the relatively easy
acceptance of visual art (but remember that subsumed under the term is a
great deal of highly popular unspeakable dreck--"I may not know much about
art, but I know what I like") is that it can cover a lot of otherwise dull
or unsightly wallspace. Which is why, as corporate headquarters have become
more imperial in scale, paintings have tended to expand to baroque
dimensions. Visual art, in other words, can be justified as an
architectural expense, which would be hard to do with a poem.
Meanwhile, to remain on the corporate front, I know from a curator at
Prudential, which has an enormous and very fine collection of 20th Century
art, that it's often very hard to convince even the head honchos to hang
anything in their offices more sophisticated than fishing scenes or
portraits of hunting dogs. Pollock and Warhol might just as well stay in
the vault.

As someone about to begin a year of intensive Russian study, I am following
Henry & Jordan's slanging match on the Rooshians with great interest.  I am
hoping that Henry is right and there is lots there, though I'll be satisfied
with Pushkin and Mayakovsky if there is nothing much else.

Jordan I think is right that Requiem and its ilk gain much from the penumbra
of story around them, and also that certain Soviet writers gain cachet among
those who don't read poetry anyway because they wrote "against" the Soviet
state.  That doesn't make them not good, it just means you have to
distinguish between their supporters and them.

In Brodsky's essay on Mandelstam (which I copyedited when it was the
introduction to Bernard Meares rhyming translations of Mandelstam, published
by Persea, thousands of years ago) Brodsky makes it clear that what happened
to Mandelstam would have happened to him in any society (look at Hart Crane,
though B doesn't make that comparison).  "When he ran out of space, he hit
time." is the operative line.

Anyway them Rooshians did a good job of art as religon, we godless
capitalists always like that.

Aviva & Brent --
Maybe you guys know -- I'm wondering when CD Wright began editing
Lost Roads, which I believe she took over after Frank Stanford died.
Do you know what year she assumed total editorial responsibilities?

As for Gander, I concur.  About 4 years ago (before I knew anything)
I wrote a review of _Lynchburg_ for the Harvard Review.  Reading now,
it's more a record of my discovering poetry than a review of Gander --
The only intelligible thing I said, referring here to "Life of Johnson upside
your Head, a libretto" (I called it a "verbal chiaroscuro"):
"But what is most remakrable about Gander is his ability to isolate
events as though they occur purely within the random constructions
of language."

Now I realize that's what events, "isolated" (i.e. written down) do.

The same year I had to give up reviewing Rosmarie Waldrop's
 _Key to the Language of America_ & now she's a favorite of mine.

yes,
and what do people consider to be a 'chapbook' now? My own definition
(usually) is a book which is sewn as a single folded group, or signature,
of pages. So it could be as short as 4 pages, or maybe as long as about 48
-- but then I've seen (and made) books which were multiple signatures at
less than 48 pages, and have chosen not to call them 'chapbooks,' rather,
just 'books.' And I'd just soon drop the term chapbook altogether, except
that I like its history, its suggestion (at least in my own head) of a book
very easily carried around, perhaps even in a pocket.

Hey, Joe Safdie, that was a post straight to the heart of the money
matter. Derrida gave us the freedom to know absolutely nothing and write
THAT into the ground where bad old REASON lies buried by the neo liberal
left. The PoMo culture market is Big Bucks and open to anyone with an
opinion, nevermind curiosity. Interesting that this late in the post-'68
'revolution' someone spent the energy on french fried idears, however
low fat and cholesterol free.



By the way, I'd venture to say that one of the most important forces, if
not the most important force, keeping this list going is $. Elbow,
elbow. Nudge, nudge. 'Come on, print my books, sir.'



The 'avant-garde' is academia lite. The meaning is gone, like so-called
'alternative' music. It really doesn't mean anything to anyone. MOre
mainstream than mainstream, if you get my drift.  Whatever it takes to
cash in is what it takes.



Bobbie, I'd love to post something of Kevin's, but I don't think he'd
dig the format and I don't wanna set him up for instantaneous deletion
by the avant-G. Although, I will end by quoting him:



"If I knew how the jungle got wall-to-wall carpeting

I'd be a rich man today..."

Jordan old heteronym, Elena Shvarts has a Blooodaxe book called "Paradise".
It's the tip of the iceberg of this strange Petersburg
poet.  Julia Kunina is not much in English, but she read recently in your
town at some big get-together (for a Talisman anthology?) - she's getting
some degree at NYU, also from Petersburg.  There's a chapbook translated
(not so well, in my humble egotrip) by Richard Sieburth called "Durer
at his mirror" from something called Lunar Offensive Press.

I must confess that all the merry-go-round on this stuff has left me
nauseated with my own blab, and if I'M nauseated what must the general
poetics person feel (I have an iron stomach, I grew up in Bob Dylan
land)?  With the sense of being an Eliot cartoon, laying down the
law about the "tradition" etc. and what poetry is... sigh, sigh, sigh.

Poetry is utterly raw experience.  It is pre-rhetoric because it is just about
pre-linguistic.  It is babytalk turned into dance music.  Does this mean
it is unrefined or brutish?  No - it is shocking & scandalous.
But I mean the scandal of innocence.  Joe, when I wrote about the surging
music of Russian poetry I was talking about the same thing Shakespeare
has in his sonnets about "hugely politic" vs. petty politics.  "Fair, kind,
and true is all my argument".  This is what people look for in poetry, at least
I do anyway - the music of raw truth,"the music of what happens"(to quote the
Celtic bard, I forget his name).

Olson was attacking a straw man humanism.  He was fighting technological
rationalism but he called it humanism.
The pure poetic impulse before politics & rhetoric is the continuum or the
link between artifice and nature.  It can lead in many directions.  It can
lead to a Robert Bly (myth as style).  It can lead to a John Ashbery
(style as myth). It can lead to a Galway Kinnell (myth as myth).
It can lead to an Allen Ginsberg (politics as poetry).  It can lead
to Language Poetry (poetry as politics).  It can lead to Adrienne
Rich (poetry politics poetry).  It can lead to Bernadette Mayer (poetry).
The main thing is, there is no satisfying formula (with me, Aristotle?)
for the Gorby doll box-within-boxes of art-politics-art- etc.
There is no formula, Joe.  But to answer your question:  my thrust
on this topic has been to suggest that like music and painting there
is a specific poetic impulse which starts at around age 1-3 and fuck the
theorists who want to box this into some sociological fart factory.

The term "chapbook" dates as far back as the seventeenth century
"cheapbook," though it could be earlier, to refer to cheaply produced and
sold pamphlets, usually political or philosophical tracts. Would be happy
to hear other sources....

No, Bill, nothing was agreed upon. The Listmaster either b-c'd me or posted

"The opinion that cognitive connections can be found in the real world

Thanks.

Tis true. Desire was sorta one performance of 80s authenticity. now
maybe prissy is right.

Like a residual Courtney tattoo 'K' on the belly (maybe a vaniety fair
cover)/ courtney still smells like teen spirit, and I look forward to
the new HOLE disc, see if she still rocks and all that, those just-so
appetites of rockandroll. I'm trying to believe in certain performances
of appetites. and, seriously, I hope girl-friend turns hollywood on its
head and gets a big old piece of cake. I like various hunger.

But this too is some multirefracted desire of authenticity, no?

I don't know.

The hyper-real as the only real reality, even in its nostalgic displaced
embodiments, and personalized performance arts.

I guess this my mina. tonight. beautiful in the letters.

Not just the transmigration of body fluids. Bram Stoker didn't even need
that particular 'real' appetite.

Maybe like a Ron Athney paper towel with the right blood stains. Thrown
to the crowd as confetti. the un-dead appetites

mc, who some years ago saw a  poem spine in a used book store called
_Desire_,  bought it and liked it. but i'm a fucking priss too. like
carson's _Eros_ better than appetite desires. but maybe too classical:
"Eros once again limb-loosener whirls me/sweetbitter, impossible to
fight off, creature from stealing up" (Poetarum Lesbiorum Fragmenta in
carson).

too classical-mauve yeah, i guess; i like blood sucking. impossible
appetites. impossible gluttonies.

A friend of mine, Rafi Zabor, just won the Pen Faulkner award for fiction,
for his book The Bear Comes Home. I know this because a friend of mine,
Mark Esper, heard my name on NPR and came running in, and I knew Rafi as
Joel when we played and recorded together for ESP-Disk and Riverboat.(And
the ESP has been released again as a cd on ZYX or some wuch. So tonight I
went to hear him read and was interviewed by a reporter-photographer team
because I knew him when. His editor was there for the reading. He had been
doing not so great before the award and I recommend the book which is by
Norton because it's the only jazz thing other than old stuff by Baraka/
Jones like Applecores that make any sense to me, and he does do, Rafi
does, the solos from inside out. An odd experience how things shift;
meanwhile I have an editor for a book of essays coming out who doesn't re-
turn my calls. Am I jealous? Of editors of course. The more marginal the
writing the more marginal the contacts and the greater the nuisance one,
meaning I, become.

Outside now in Brooklyn there are people screaming and throwing things.

On the way there I passed one of my favorite bookshops, Beyond Words Book-
store, only to find out it's closing down. Barnes and Noble are about a
half-mile away. So there's a sale on at 186 Fifth Avenue, Brooklyn, if
anyone is around looking for. It carries mostly queer fiction and essays
and multiculturalisms and poems and it was there I got the Levitsky Por-
traits, Yay for Rachel! (my exclamation, not part of the title), and an
Eileen Miles School of Fish so I can read not standing up sometime. So the
bookstore is about a few hundred feet from where Rafi/Joel is reading;
there should be a point but there isn't except that Rafi/Joel reads quite
beautifully and if you like Ayler for example or Coleman or those old ESP
artists like Guiseppe Logan, you'll like the book, and if you like any
sort of jazz you'll like the book, and I guess the other point is that
just about anything makes me sad nowadays.

I feel since I'm in _this space_ I should write more so I want to mention
a couple of other authors, Inoue Yasushi who writes historic/Borgesian
fiction - another book having something to do with the poetics I work
through at times, Relfections on Japanese Taste, The Structure of Iki, by
Kuki Shuzo, who works through phenomenology.

There have been a great number of car crashes in my neighborhood, one of
which included a Trans Am slamming into our building which remains up-
right, but for how long.

Tsvetayava is twice the poet Pushkin is and so is Pasternak, Akmatova is a

and Yesinin, you got lots of treats coming Simon don't prejudge it,

Please, oh please, don't get your deconstruction from NYRoB.  Those Oxford
Dons masquerading as New York intellectuals have had a chip the size M.
Foucault's bald head about postmodernism since day one.  This time they
have a native informant, rather than John Searle (who weighed in such an
enlightened manner in the Stanford Humanities debate), but its the same
spiel as usual.  Lilla gives away the game by saying that Aron is the only
political philospher of note who has been produced in France in the
post-war period.  Aron is essentially the French Oakeshott, a conservative
thinker that theorist-baiting liberals love to cite when they see red.
Furthermore, the whole article footnotes various accounts of
deconstruction and postmodernism that have occurred in the New York Review
of Books.  What looks like scholarship is actually self-puffery.  The last
time I checked, most articles in reputable academic journals cite work
published in other journals.

However, it is the spectre of Foucault that really haunts this article.
The two-sentence dismissal of him early on misreads his work badly
(perhaps Lilla has read "Madness and Civilisation," while that final quote
from Les Mots et les Choses is easily the most cited piece of Foucault
there is). Foucault haunts Lilla because for all the sound and fury about
Derrida, it is the he who ultimately deserves the blame for making liberal
a dirty word for the left.  To risk an inappropriate though not inapt
metaphor, if Derrida is the Gorbachev of Western Metaphysics, then
Foucault is the Yeltsin.  Derrida is an academic par excellence,
suggesting we read the canon in yet another imaginative if esoteric way,
while Foucault turned his attention away from the theatricum philosophicum
much earlier and suggested we go to the archive and pursue the grey art of
genealogy.  From Saidian accounts of orientalism to queer studies, his
followers are legion.

To my notion, this is not a bad thing.  Giving up great books as the only
guide for the politically perplexed simply means that knowing your Locke
doesn't make you a champion of human rights.  Or for that matter, spouting
off about human rights doesn't necessarily make a partisan for liberation.
Fouault and Derrida were and are certainly suspicious of liberal
platitudes as platforms for progress:  the latter for perhaps willfully
obscure epistemo-metaphysico-ethico reasons, the former because such
platitudes are usually double(even multiply)edged.  After all, the
developer of the panopticon, Jeremy Bentham, was an Enlightenment thinker
and a reformer. Foucault is rightfully suspicious of rousing liberal
slogans--or for that matter, rousing radical slogans--because they _have_
been used to promulgate social control.  Lilla is all wet about Foucault,
because it ain't the margins that are the oppressed, but the center (the
bourgeois) which represses itself and then sees who else might find
freedom through surveillance (though that center is not a center--you get
my drift).  Like it or not, successful identity politics means the state
(and the market) can classify you and "discipline" you to its heart's
(exactly the wrong word) content.

Lilla's fear of the postmodern bookshelf would be comic, if it wasn't the
only way journalists react to postmodernism.  I wonder what books he is
referring to.  Isn't it suspicious that he cites no examples?  Is he just
covering the fact that he laments the disappearance of common culture (I
suppose he doesn't watch the X-Files) and doesn't want to show his true
colors?  Just who is the big baby here anyway?  Actually, pace Lilla (and
Aron) Foucault's work on the role of intellectuals and politics is some of
the most thoughtful in the wake of Camus and Sartre.  He contrasted the
Sartrean universal intellectual--thinker as prophet and leader-- with the
modern specific intellectual--thinker as toolmaker.  Predictably, he chose
the latter, though not without some irony, since he was probably the last
universal intellectual (certainly the last one from France).  I think the
specific intellectual is the role that a cultural worker (poets, critics,
novelists, etc)  inevitably play in a consumerist society. It's not a
question of Politics with a big P, about which even Derrida (as Lilla does
show well) can sound ponderous and vague, but politics with a little "p".
It is a bit arrogant (not to say Stalinist) to suggest any one profession
(be it political philosopher, literary critic, poet) has the only correct
line on politics, but even worse, it is absurd to suggest that skepticism
about language equals fascism.  That said, I don't think it is necessary
to go to a tenured radical (or reactionary) for a political philosophy
anyway.  As the great sage of our time said once, you don't need a
weatherman to tell which way the wind is blowing.

I dug through hundreds of tapes tonight for these two lines by Gwendolyn. I had several of her books including The Fire Eaters and Afterworlds (her last), but they did not survive the fire at my place a few years ago. These are from The Fire Eaters, the title poem of a meditation on pain, loss, and transformation, and come at the end of the poem. They come as an affirmation or conclusion of her fine poem:

"A hairless wonder will be born again.
Scared silly or suddenly sane."

Thanks, Bob, for your words about her and Milton Acorn. I read her books in a dark time and found them beautiful, strong, and laughing, and they helped me more than I can say.

Come on, George, you must have some of her books in your library. You probably knew her quite well. Can you give us one? I'm in Seattle where there aren't such things.

I see Coach House Books has part of one of her works online at http://www.chbooks.com/onlinebooks/macewen/title.html, but it's not one I'm familiar with.

She and Acorn were quite outside the roof of the institutionalized avant garde of Canada. You are under it, though perhaps not within it? Besides, it may be an eventuality in an institutionalized culture. The roof is bigger than it is down here, and has its advantages and social/human justifications. What are we to say of Gwendolyn and Milton Acorn in this context but that they lived as truly to their art as they could? And that this is often less than accomodating?

P.S. My fave of Cohen's is The Energy of Slaves, one which ss missed quite completely in his book on Cohen's work.

Actually, no, I didnt save it. And now I wish I had. I cant even remember
the reviewer's name. It was a pretty unusual name, I remember, and he was a
philosophy professor at, I'm pretty sure, Carleton University, and I
wouldnt be surprised if the review was in _Books in Canada_/

I always figured that it was a little book offered for sale by a chapman.

If so, it would be one of those  words that did not originate in the USA.

Linda,

C.D. started editing Lost Roads in 1978-79, right after Frank's death.  The
grant for it was going to be pulled, but somebody (I think it was either
Jim Whitehead or Alan Dugan...most likely Whitehead) wrote a letter on her
behalf and the grant was kept.

It's not so much a matter of $$$ that I was trying to get at in my original
post, as much as a question of cultural visibility.  The whole discourse of
art  -- the discourse surrounding challenging & subversive work -- is played
out on an impressively large scale--  John Yau after all is much better known
-- except among us -- as an art critic than as a poet.  As for cultural
invisibility: in the last week or so I've read at least 2 reviews of the new
Stein Lib of Am books & both make the incredible (only to us) observation that
she has had *no impact on contemp Am writing*.  So what? My point is that this
clearly problematizes the politics of avant-garde poetry -- it doesn't make
these politics, whatever they are, illegitimate -- but it does trouble them.
(Of course cultural visibility is a relative thing -- the literary novel only
reaches an audience comparable to that of, say, American professional soccer.)
A theory: the cultural invisiblity of avant-garde poetry is not owing to the
fact that the mainstream gets all the attention, but because the aesthetic of
mainstream poetry (without question the most reactionary of all the arts) made
poetry itself seem irrelevant to contemp critical thought (practically nobody
bothers to pass through the threshold of mainstream poetry -- and the
mainstrem is in a sense the front door -- to find their way to the back rooms
of exp. writing). I think if the mainstream had been more adventurous (if
experiment had been valued as a mainstream virtue as it has been generally in
the visual arts) poetry, in all its aspects, would have a more visible
presence in the culture today.  However, one of the strengths of av-g poetry
seems to me its inter-generic character -- though it's suprising to me how
little important work has been done along these lines -- or alot of what is
important calls itself "sound art," "textual art," "book art," etc., not
"poetry".

I am firmly of the belief that if you tell me something MUST and CAN be
expressed only in mathematical terms, then it is simply untrue about the
world we live in. If you can translate what you have so elegantly
expressed in your mathematical language, into English words, using metaphors,
analogies, and other linguistic techniques, then you might in fact have
said something truly meaningful about the universe where we live.

I firmly believe that every scientist and mathematician ought to be forced
to make those translations a routine part of their work, so as to avoid
mathematical mystification as a purely "mythematical" truth that has much to
do about conformity with the principles of formal logic, but might be wholly
untrue about the real world. The failure as to translation between
mathematical symbollic logic and linguistic poetic forms of expression would
be indicative
as to excessive imaginative idealism as opposed to solid foundations of real
empiricism.

Also, I like the idea as to science becoming more poetic.

Mark responds thusly:

The reasons in my opinion are not to be found in brain circuitry; nor in
as simple an attitude as "snobbery."  The reasons are (like almost all
things) historical.

Different cultures shape and warp under different pressures, and are
torqued by different events (whose original thrust had nothing to do with
culture or art-activities, essentially).  Thus, the particular mix of
peoples and how they were mixed in the U.S. (slavery, in particular, and
the especially pointed heritage of division it bequeathed us) has made
popular music (driven in large part by polyrhythms, syncopations,
abrasions and momentum from W. Africa) a strikingly dominant presence in
our culture. You have to step back for a moment, and get enuff distance to
realize that this isn't a universal.  It is a unique instance of the
evolution of a cultural system, deriving from the contingent accidents of
history.  (At least, they appear contingent, and are to some extent, when
viewed at a certain rough-grained level of resolution...) Whereas, in
eleventh century China, 17th century Russia, 19th century Spain or
Hungary, the preeminent art-activity to no small extent was poetry.  When
I write as i have recently about poetry's marginalization vis-a-vis the
commodified econo-culture of our day, these comparative details have to be
kept in mind.

Now, as far as (visual, plastic) "art" is concerned, this also has nothing
to do with sociobiological speculations regarding brain alignment etc.  It
has in my opinion to do with the development of different art-activities
in the overall flow of economic structures.  (Yes, they *do* flow..) Just
as popular music is a more dominent element in the landscape because of
the afro-euro mix (but also due to its suitability for large scale
performance, & for important functions like dancing, compared to say
poetry;  which starts to bring "scales of profitability" back into the
argument.) so the production of unique visual art-objects has its own
historical line of development.  In essence, there is more money available
to support viz art for the same reason there is more to support music
activites (..compared to poetry);  it is more tied in to the profit
economy.  Benjamin's concept of the "aura" that would be whittled away by
the age of mechanical reproduction, has to be qualified (as he partly
knew) when one realizes that the aura (like most things) has been
ruthlessly commodified under late capitalism...There is a lot of moola
floating around in the "art world" because a unique physical aritfact can
be considered **an invertment**; and under the especially parasitic and
degenerate conditions that have been brought in under Reagan and Clinton,
there is a huge amount of rich-white-men's money there to be invested in
channels outside economic production (as the far right agenda continues to
pump most wealth upwards to the top 6 percent or so of families).  Thus:
lots and lots of *possibility* that any given artist may become the next
big thing and have her sculptures bought as investments at a very high
price...This dynamic burgoned relentlessly thoughout the 1970-1990 period,
and eventually it was noticed for the disturbing abberent thing it is, and
has since occasioned much hand-wringing and soul-searching by
intellectuals on the art-world watch.

Just an addendum to my long disquisition bouncing off of tom bell's
post.....

After launching it i read the estimable Chax's post re rich artists being
a myth.

Yes (altho having known a number of painters, i wasn't at all aware that
this **was** a cultural myth!!) it's true that viz artists are
almost never rich...

Just thought i'd point out that (though Charles wasn't addressing my
comments) my (and tom b.) speaking of there being more money floating
around the "art-world" is a structural point, having to do with the scale
of cash flow.  It doesn't for a moment imply that most of that money is
finding its way into the pockets of artists!! it isn't..It is going to
gallery owners and is being passed among corporate art-consumers and
millionaire collectors, who (as i mentioned) have in the last 40 years
come to use the "rarity value" of viz art as a form of non-productive
investment, like arbitrage on currency exchange, stock markets, bonds etc.
etc.  Labor (including that of painters) creates all wealth.  And the
wealth is then expropriated by those who control and own the structures of
production and distribution...

communistically,

too much artforum, perhaps?

from where I sit, in a city in the American southwest of some size with an
arts community which is probably unduly large and active for its size; and
because of my own circumstances, familial and otherwise, the wider arts
(visual, dance, music, etc.) is more "my" community than is the
specifically "poetry" community here -- this "lots and lots of
*possibility* that any [ANY] given artist may become the next big thing . .
." is about as much possibility as that any [ANY] given poet will win the
next Nobel Prize for literature. And if we want to talk about the art
market in this way, we might also want to talk about the literary market,
which, when you get away from poetry specifically and into fiction and
nonfiction, includes "lots and lots" of possibility for money, too -- but a
similar tiny few who see such money.

That said, I still think there's a great deal of truth about what Mark and
Jacques say about the art market as an entity (market, social, cultural,
etc.) -- just that not a lot of this filters down to the artists.

Actually, the title Mr. Knife, Miss Fork comes from
René Crevel's novel, BABYLON, where in the first chapter,
the young girl, whose father has run off with her young
cousin, imagines the couple through maneuvers of her knife and
fork across the white tablecloth of the Atlantic Ocean.

Several artists, Max Ernst (whose art appears on the cover of
the first volume), Mann Ray, and Meret Oppenheim, did works
titled "Mr Knife, Miss Fork," in connection with Crevel's book.

I just liked the title, and then, as I was writing my introduction
realized the significance of it: My name "Messerli" means little
knife, the eating utensil in Swiss German. As I put it in the
first issue, "I am willing to play the knife, but only with the
dance of the fork [the poetic community at large] can we celebrate the
feast."

In that context, I am interested in hearing from anyone, with experience,
who might be interested in doing short reviews. Of course, there are a
great many new American books of poetry to be reviewed, but I am
particulary seeking reviews for the following books of poetry in other
languages and of translation:

Duda Machado, MARGEM DE UMA ONDA (in Portuguese)
Pascal Quignard, SARX (translated)
Anne-Marie Albiach, A GEOMETRY (translated)
Dino Campana, ORPHIC SONGS (translated)
Hatif Janabi, QUESTIONS AND THEIR RETINUE (translated)
Leonardo Sinisgalli, I SAW THE MUSES (translated)

American titles in need of short reviews include:

Arthur Sze, THE REDSHIFTING WEB
Peter Gizzi, ARTIFICIAL HEART
Michael Gizzi, NO BOTH

If you're interested please respond to djmess@sunmoon.com

Thanks.

>>so tell us more; who's this gwendolyn mckuen
>So really: how well known is Gwen MacEwen's work in the US?

Interesting question.

Due to her natural features, her outstanding sense of fashionable style,
and her flair for some acting, she became popular, at a time when poetry
was the thing to do, on Canadian street corners and in Canadian taverns
and coffee houses. In America it was the "beats". In Canada it was
"the people's poets" (though not named that yet). If it had been only
the poetry that she wrote, and nothing else, no matter how talented
the writing, or how important the subject of it, we can be quite sure
MacEwen would have remained entirely unknown in Canada as well as
in most other places.

A writer needs a lot more than simply writing, to become "popular". Also an
artist needs a lot more than simply having the right friends, and knowing
the right people, to be popular enough. Those ingredients also being
essential, as in necessary but not sufficient in themselves. That, and the
essential element of some opportunity to unfetter and develop the potential
of native talents. The latter is not so often truly accorded by life to
those attempt to achieve. Least of all nowadays, as we seem to be a society
that is in an ever upward spiral of technological ascendancy and in a
concurrent ever downward spiral as to artistic possibilities, compared to
those many decades ago. Technology has gained popularity and art has lost
popularity. Showmanship has also gained popularity and the expression of
intensities and depths of meanings have lost considerable ground. We live in
a different environment. (I digress somewhat. I wanted to emphasize that it
takes a lot of popularity to gain meaningful opportunities, and some of the
criteria for popularity are variables that change historically.)

Might we say that for any real semblance of artistic success some popularity
within the artist's lifetime is an essential ingredient ?  On the basis of
the tales that are told, Gwen MacEwen was very popular, and particularly
among those who knew her. In her day there was a time when she was as close
to being Canadian poetic royalty, the darling of the poetry circles, as
anyone has been or could be. She was simply adored. That was in an era when
poets were far less tongue tied, more abundant, more accepted, and more
flamboyant.

The elements comprising popularity and need for it are as true in a limited
context as it is in a larger context. Despite that example (MacEwen) it is
often far from necessary as to the writing being good writing, according to
any definable criteria, for popularity to accrue. It is also often far from
necessary as to the writer writing about "interesting" subject matter.
Sometimes the dullest writing can be very popular among the crowds.

maybe eventually.  i feel kinda shy about it because i'm concerned that
it'll be considered reductive, and i'm not quite confident about my ability
to make an airtight argument.  but basically i want to look at Hannah's
poetry as trauma-related, thru a kind of "witness-victim" or
"participant-observer" status as a young Jewish-American woman coming of
age during the Jewish genocide of WWII and the subsequent revelations in
the US press (1960s) about the real conditions of the camps.  i see her
clairvoyance as a kind of dissociative state, the type that also

I don't have much Unstructured Free Time today, so this must be brief--but
you're right to call me on this.  After my post, I felt that, given the
original post I responded to was complementary to me, my tone was a bit
severe.  I don't have a surplus of praise in my life, so I certainly don't
want to discourage any attempts at that.

And, of course--anybody can do whatever they want with Desire in writing,
of course, of course.  And psychoanalytic theory has been a major influence
to me--but there is a brutality and kinkiness to that theory that seems to
often get washed over when talking about writing one's desire.  I think of
some lady in a maraboo-fringed robe, perfumed, Mont Blanc poised above the
page.  This is modern-day American I'm living in, where ravishing and
ravaged are synonyms more often than not.

And while we're on the French thing, I was force-fed Bataille in my years
as a young writer.  I'm like this goose with a huge Bataille liver.  Even
though, as a woman, I find him tres problematic.

Blame this all on my recent reading--Mark Seltzer's book on Serial Killers,
now that Wasted book about the anorectic who gets down to 53 pounds, and
waiting in line, Jacqueline Rose's Why War.  Not exactly cheery.

x,
Dodie

sounds fascinating, and maybe "airtight arguments" aren't what we need,
anyway. or airtight poems. how about flow-thru arguments?

I wonder about how you are measuring wealth.

What is true wealth ?  What makes someone truly rich ?

Surely you cannot define that purely as money and the ownership of things ?

To be able to spend some part of one's life with a beloved significant
other, in ways that are mutually satisfying to that particular couple.

To have supportive and understanding family.

Some elements of freedom of expression and freedom of association.

Freedom from being psychologically and/or physically abused.

To have good friends. Particularly some who share one's interests.

To have one's health, and not suffer rejection or contempt due to any
limitation, illness or disability that one might happen to suffer from.

I am sure I have not exhausted the list of what makes someone truly rich.

Are there any rich artists ?   I don't really know.     Are there any ?

chapbook comes from chapter book, i believe, a term still used in grade
schools for certain kinds of short publications; kids read chapter books
in, say, 4th, 5th grade, before getting to novels and the like. these books
are paperbacks, and they are not long enough, usually, to be perfect
bound, so they are often sewn signatures between paper covers, like a
lot of the great poetry in this country from 1968 to 1980.

Having the opportunity to do work that is personally satisfying and that
oneself enjoys doing. That is definitely another indication of great wealth,
though not necessarily monetary wealth. Sometimes that requires some
monetary sacrifice rather than gain. It depends on what the situation really is.

The freedom to make that choice is also then a kind of being rich.

As are many other kinds of positive choices. Not the binary kinds of choices
of something or nothing, but real positive choices between this and that.
Not only the negative freedom of freedom from hunger, but the positive
freedom of being able to sit at the feast and to enjoy it.  Though I intend
that more as  a metaphor than as a literal statement.

Thursday, 26 February 1998

William Kennard, Chairperson
Federal Communications Commission
fax: 202-418-0232

Mr. Kennard,
I am writing as a supporter of micro-radio (i.e., less
than 100-watt), and, as such, writing against the FCC=92s policy of
harassment regarding such stations. Micropower radio is an essential
community-building tool, providing a local alternative to commercial
stations, which display a =93minimal commitment to public service=94 (a
quote from New England=92s regional FCC chief) - so much so, in fact,
that it=92s difficult to understand what =93public=94 might mean in this
context, save =93those willing to pay=94. The FCC must recognize - you
must recognize, Mr. Kennard - the agency=92s and your own explicit
commitment to maintaining publically-owned airwaves in the public
interest - that is, with a view to supporting local communities - and
not solely in terms of corporate (National Assoc. of Broadcasters)
interest. At this time, between a limit to 100+ watt stations, and its
exceedingly high licensing and engineering fees, the FCC is simply not
fulfilling its promised role; further, in having deliberately adopted
a policy of closure re community micropower stations, the FCC is
actively countering its supposed agenda. The comparison, now frequent,
of your agency=92s licensing policies with England=92s Stamp Act and
similar repressive measures enacted to =93protect the public=94 - though
actually a =93protection=94 in service of other powers - is apt; and I
must remind you that the guarantees given by our Bill of Rights were
drafted in direct opposition to these measures.

Let me close by exhorting you earnestly to live up to your word, and
to pursue the stated goals of the FCC. Micropower stations must be
allowed to operate, and without harassment or the threat of closure;
low wattage airspace must be opened to public use; finally, the FCC
must adopt a reasonably scaled table of fees that takes into account
the means of small communities in counterpoint to the wealth of
broadcasting corporations. The airwaves belong to the public, and if
administered they must be, they must be administered best to serve the
public; to do otherwise is contrary to our stated rights to free
speech, free assembly, and freedom of the press.

Thank you.

I'm very much interested in ANYBODY'S code poems--if they are truly

It is my opinion that with the increased and easier availability of
relatively high powered, extremely portable, small transmitter equipment on
the commercial market, there is a need to rethink the kinds of legislation
and regulations that that would be applicable to that category of technology.

The same criteria ought to apply as are applicable to what are presumed to
be responsible larger broadcasters. That is, they ought to be licensed, and
ought to have to keep logs of their broadcasts. Unregulated use, without
adequate log tapes of actual program content having to be maintained, leads
to use of such equipment as a means of unfair competitive practice, where
individuals who have that technology can use it to compete against other
individuals in extremely hostile ways, in effect endangering true freedoms
of speech and the press. I do not think it is necessary to list off all the
kinds of hostile competition that could occur, or to what purposes, whether
political, social, or economic.

Unregulated there is also very little that could be done about covert usage
by aliens who have aggendas contrary to the political, economic, and
socio-cultural interests of most Americans or Canadians.  Such technologies
easily lend themselves to use as a mechanism for brain-washing,
propagandizing, and proseletyzing. The question becomes where is the line to
be drawn between freedom of speech as debate between somewhat enlightened
individuals or groups, and ignorant, ideological, radio-frequency attacks
that can potentially infiltrate any legitimate bandwidth in any geographic
area ?

I think the whole question needs to be thought through a lot more carefully/

Non licensed, non accountable, non logged, stations do need to be tracked
down technologically and eliminated. Perhaps by extreme technological
prejudice, as the persistent radio frequency terrorists that they are.
Particularly where they are tracked down as piggy-backing on legitimate
signals, or intruding into the bandwidths of legitimate licensed signals in
their attempts to capture audiences against the free choise of those
audiences. Remember that transmitters can transmit on _any_ frequency. They
are small and readily portable, requiring very little electrical power to
function for a period of time. They can remain mobile. Some micro
transmitters, commercially available, can transmit on the bandwidth of your
favourite radio or television station, in effect superimposing their signal
on what you want to hear. However, the FCC, or the CRTC has yet to be
empowered to track them down and blow them away so as to prevent damage to
legitimate, licensed, responsible, logged, broadcasters.

The problem of "I heard it, so why is it not on the log" is going to become
increasingly frequent unless monitoring and tracking is increased, and
monitoring and tracking are relatively useless if there is no licensing.

I think that would protect real freedom of speech, and real freedom of the
press, rather than what free for all on the radio waves would accomplish. I
think the latter is the real danger.

my sympathies w/ the above.  but whining can be fun, in proper context.
frankly, i have a great life.  if i weren't a "cultural worker" who'd found

well since yr so flattering, i'll say a little more, in a more generalized
way.  let me be also frank about something, which ron silliman will be
right to call academic careerism: the essay is under consideration in a
coupla venues (a book and a journal) and the "ethics" of posting on the web
while something's under consid. are still out w/ the jury.  anyway, i was
interested in hannah as a jewish writer ever since charles b first
mentioned her to me in this context, in 1995.  then, when working on a
review of John Wieners's 707 Scott St for XCP 3 (stay posted, and don't
forget to renew your subscriptions, y'all) i became fascinated with the
trope of the "participant-observer" as it may pertain to the kinds of
"authoethnographies" that many Beat writers (including my fave, Bob
Kaufman) seem involved in --you know, documenting their "scene" etc.
Trying to link that with lyric subjectivity, anti-lyric
fragmented-subjectivity, etc.  And since i was working on Weiner at the
same time and could see some of that self-dissociated
amanuensis-of-one's-own-experience type sensibility, i thot i had an IDEA.
and relating this to trauma, well, it seems entirely plausible if we take
into consideration the periodization most often associated w/ the
"postmodern" --1945.  For someone like Kaufman, whose social location cd be
considered traumatic regardless of the "watershed" year, the argument wd
have to be historicized somewhat differently than for weiner, but you get
the picture...  so i got all mixed up w/ weiner and wieners esp since
sometimes (due no doubt to some regional peculiarities in Eastern European
Yiddish transplanted to the US) people pronounce Hannah's last name to
rhyme with "Meaner," and sometimes homonymous with "Whiner."  etc.

And here's what the FCC did to our local microbroadcast station.  They
simply assigned the frequency to a local fundamentalist Christian group
wanting a radio license.  This was not at the instigation of the Christian
group --- when you apply to the FCC you don't specify frequency.

No muss, no fuss, and no lawsuits pending.

Maria - please don't be shy - you're way brilliant, girl! - and who cares
about "airtight" anyhow? The point is to make our brains leap in a new
unexpected direction - to open up new fields of inquiry and consideration.

Thanks Mark Presjnar for a very thoughtful analysis of what drives the art
market here in the US of A.

I missed the Objectivists panel yesterday but my co-worker and fellow poet
Randy Roark tells me that Carl Rakosi had some very interesting comments to
make about Zukofsky's personal life - real unvarnished. Item: LZ had never
even been swimming or on a bicycle till he was 30. Item: he was terrible
with women and in marrying Celia chose the wrong woman for him. Item: he
always preached clarity as the ultimate poetic virtue but in reading his
poems you could garner no idea what he felt about anything. All of which is
debatable, I suppose. I'm no LZ expert - but Mark Scroggins, I'll pass along

math is beautiful.  a well-concieved and well-stated mathematical
equations is one of the most beautiful things i know, not the least
because it helps me to understand the world i live in better (also one of
the reasons i like/respect/need poetry)

E=mc2 is poetic:
it's dense,it  achieves maximum impact w/ a minimum no.of words ("words"),
it's imagistic or analogic ("E" is an image that stands
in for the concept of energy), it's linguistic (mathematical formulas
follow a system, a set of rules, like any language, that must be
understood and acknowledged and adhered to in order to make meaning), it
tells the truth--hell, it even sounds good when you read it aloud--what
else do you demand of poetry?

science is poetic.  it's a poetry that most of us don't read very often
and so is unfamiliar to our ears.  maybe we need to read science as much
as scientists need to read poetry.
try _In Search of Schrodinger's Cat_, Gribban, and _Six Easy Pieces_,
Feynman for starters and see if it doesn't change your poetry...

SaoPaulo (may 24-27) was a conference on literary magazines with
representatives from Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, French Canada,
Spain, Portugal, and the United States.  Nate Mackey (hambone), David
Bonnano (APR) and Paul Hoover and I (New American Writing) were the
American (as in US) attendees.  Clayton Eshleman was also set to represent
Sulfur but was unable to attend.  The conference was organized by
Brazilian poet Horacio Costa and sponsored by the cultural ministry of Sao
Paulo.  Just to see so many lively lit mags from the Americas and hear
similar stories about funding and distribution difficulties world-wide was
enlightening.  There was also a reading at the University of Sao Paulo by
Mackey, Hoover, Chernoff, Eduardo Mosches (mexico), two Argentinian poets,
Daniel Semilovitch and Paula Brudny.  Smoky room, avid listeners.
Resolutions by the end of the conference to explore means of international
exchange and distribution for the magazines and a possible conference to
follow in Mexico.  Many lively papers given on the history of literary
magazine publishing and audience by the more than 30 editors.  I read the
paper that Clayton E. had faxed.  It was a lively and cogent discussion of
lit. mag publishing and outsider politics.  I hope he plans on printing it
in Sulfur or elsewhere.

to add to what charles and peter have contributed

i first learned about the history of the chapbook in the context of
children's literature / evidently the early folktales (Robin Hood, King
Arthur) were distributed (c.16th/17th centuries) in chapbooks, growing in
popularity into the 18th c. as a kind of "underground" reading phenomonen /
and represented i've learned the first break from  the more didactic
"hornbooks" popular particularly among the Puritans

unlike charles i'd rather not drop the term / perhaps for some it too often
evokes the sense of "cheap" or shoddily crafted -- which also has its
appeal, in the sense of "rough-edged", showing the scars of production and
distribution and use / and consistent with its history the chap still has
an "underground" appeal, and at least offers an alternative to those
perfect-bound puritans! / personal computers and printers too make it
possible to produce rather slick chapbooks, literally overnight (joel k.,
you awake?) / witness the age of the chapbook micropress / the
"chapbook-length poem" as well is an evolving form worth looking at, for
its connection to the means of production

Maria, this sounds like an interesting essay.  But I read this last sentence as
an indirect comment on my recent posts re: the primordial poetic impulse etc.
so I will respond WITH BREVITY.

It's now a cliche that we've lived through an era of theory.  But I read
your position in the above post as the flip side of mine.  Both positions
turn into caricature when taken to extremes: mine, to a sort of anti-
intellectual art-for-art's sake (an oxy-moronic phrase in itself); yours,
to the tyranny of "talk about" - the kind of interpretation that substitutes
for the artwork; a translation rather than a review that keeps its
distance.

All this has been hashed around before on the list.  My feeling is though that
everybody shd be a little like Wallace Stevens: they should have a personal
theory of poetry as a phenomenon, in itself, sui generis.  A poem can be shown
to mean an endless number of things; it's got a shape & a form & a genesis
however - & the genesis may well include the history you describe - but I
would guess that Hannah Wiener also falls into the general "poet" category
I've been trying to promote - a representative of the "poetic impulse".
Okay I shut up again. Bye bye rest ye all end of blab sigh... - Henry G.

        Dodie, thanks for the clarification. I like the image of Battaile
de fois gras! Too bad for me that you typed "sly" when you meant "shy,"
though. I know very little about desire, in the sense of "understand."
That's why I write about it, I expect. But I anticipate learning more as I
read _Mina Harker_ .

On second thoughts, maybe you _meant_ to write "sly." When I'm around you
(and mindful of how much one brings of oneself to these judgements) I do
sometimes feel that we share a taste for sly humor.  xox, David

Forgive me if i am wrong, but I believe it was Daniel B. who said that
_Book of Mercy_ was Cohen's most recent book of poetry.  But I could also
almost swear that _Stranger Music_ came out way after 1984 (which is when
_Book of Mercy_ was published).  I am looking at _BOM_ right now, and _SM_
isn't even listed as a publication in this book, so it must have been after
this.  At any rate, some very fine examples of Cohen's broad poetic range
can be found in _SM_, as well as many lyrics to many of his songs.

Also: George, where did you say that review was located when you first saw
it???  I am really interested in reading it.

For what it's worth,

Morpheal has given you the 'romantic' story about Gwen MacEwen, but she is
more important for the poetry than the story. She was part of the terrific
uprising of young poets in the 60s, but went her own way, via magic &
Egypt, to a poetic of openness that was far closer to Duncan than to
Creeley, say. At her best, she wrote a joyful large poetry; at her worst,
she descended into a rhetoric far too fat with yearning for the
'unspeakable.' Her first novel, _Julian the Magician_ was actually
published by Corinth (1963).

One of the best biographies of a conemporary Canadian poet is _The Shadown
Maker_ on her. Her Selected Poems would be a delight, on the whole.

FEATURE - Taco Bell's Gidget an Internet hot dog


            By Mark Egan
            LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Taco Bell Chihuahua  may be
smaller than a cat or even a loaf of bread but he has folks all
across America, especially those of Latino heritage, growling at
him.
            His detractors bark that he is vile and disgusting and
charge him with mocking the Hispanic community. His fans see a
charming hard-working canine eking out a living as a
''pitch-pup'' for a fast food chain.
            Love him or hate him, the Chihuahua called ``Gidget'' is
America's biggest canine star.
            ``What's that Lassie? Little Timmy has fallen into the
well?'' has been replaced as the most famous utterance
attributed to a dog by Gidget's catch phrase ``Yo quiero Taco
Bell.''
            But America's Hispanic community is not amused.
            Gidget shot to fame last year when Taco Bell began airing a
series of commercials featuring the big-eared, bug-eyed,
shivering dog. Talking with a thick Mexican accent, in each
commercial Gidget searches doggedly for his heart's desire, ``Yo
quiero Taco Bell,'' which means ``I want Taco Bell.''
            In the first ad Gidget turned up his nose at a female dog
called ``Dinky'' in favor of some Taco Bell. Much of the
negative publicity since then has wrongly targeted Dinky who
these days only works as a back-up dog for the main attraction,
Gidget.

            DOG DAYS REVOLUTION
            Among the charges leveled against Gidget by Hispanic groups
are that he has portrayed the Mexican population as moronic and
has defiled the memory of Latin-American revolutionary Ernesto
''Che'' Guevara by posing as a revolutionary wearing a ``Che''
beret.
            Nowhere is the uproar more evident that on that high-tech
soapbox of the 1990s, the Internet.
            ``The Taco Bell commercial with that little dog is offensive
and here's why; because there is such a lack of positive
Hispanic images on American English language TV ... this
Chihuahua lampoon -- in which he speaks in a cruelly
stereotypical accent -- stands out like a sore thumb,'' Rick
Martinez wrote in the Internet publication LatinoLink.
            Others on the Internet echo that sentiment. ``It is clear
Taco Bell is engaged in a campaign to humiliate Hispanic people
by portraying (Gidget), a representative of the Hispanic
community, as a vandal, a witch, an inept thief ... and an
asexual crazed lunatic,'' one Gidgetphobe wrote.
            Taco Bell, a division of Tricon Global Restaurants Inc.,
said none of its ads are meant to offend.
            ``We pay special attention to the Hispanic community because
of the Mexican heritage of our food,'' said Taco Bell
spokeswoman Laurie Gannon. ``We did market research to ensure
people would receive the ads in the way they were intended which
is entertaining and educational, not offensive.''
            Rival fast food chains are having a field day with parodies
of the doggy ads. One such spot from Jack in the Box features an
ugly Gidget look-alike with a flatulence problem from eating too
much rice and beans. Chicken joint El Pollo Loco is running
radio ads with a Mexican voice like Gidget's claiming Taco Bell
''tastes just like dog food.''

            GIDGET FINDS A FRIEND
            But not everyone is down on Gidget. One Internet user
wrote, ``I think Gidget may have a cause of action against the
Hispanic (objectors) for trying to interfere with his contract.
The characterizations made by the people that oppose this
commercial are more demeaning to Hispanic people.''
            Another wrote, ``How .. is one dog representing the entire
Mexican population? Just because he is speaking Spanish? I speak
Spanish and want some Taco Bell, am I offending Mexicans too?''
Others point out that the dog is smart, can answer obscure
Jeopardy questions and is bilingual. Not too shabby.
            One of the first to call for Gidget's head to roll was
former Clearwater, Fla. Mayor Gabriel Cazares, who called for a
nationwide Latino boycott of Taco Bell.
            ``(This) is definitely a hate crime that leads to the type
of immigrant bashing that Hispanics are now up against,'' said
Cazares, president of the local chapter of the country's oldest
Hispanic civil rights group, the League of United Latin American
Citizens.
            But his sentiments were not echoed by the group's Washington
headquarters which said it had no problem with the campaign and
declined to back his boycott.

            MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE RANCH ....
            Taco Bell, which is spending about $200 million this year on
its campaign, is no stranger to controversy. Last year it
angered the medical community who claimed its ads, featuring
basketball star Shaquille O'Neal, were insulting and insensitive
to people with dystonia, a debilitating neurological disorder.
The adverts featured the basketball star eating tacos with his
neck cocked sideways.
            Another ad irked patriots when the company ran full page
newspapers ads on April Fool's day claiming it had bought the
Liberty Bell and renamed it, what else, the Taco Bell.
            The latest controversy is reminiscent of the fuss 25 years
ago when Latin Americans protested that the ``Frito Bandito,'' a
cartoon character hawking corn chips, portrayed Latinos as
highway robbers. That protest ended with the Frito Bandito being
retired by chip maker Frito-Lay.
            But controversy or not Gidget's future seems assured because
when all is said and done Taco Bell's sales are up about 3
percent.
            One recent poll on the Internet found 98.1 percent wanted
Gidget to stay on the air with almost no one calling for his
head. And besides, like all big stars, he's under contract.

Subject:      Re: raw numbers

The debate below, it seems to me, is one of those familiars that seem to show up everywhere people begin to generalize sufficiently away from the realities of the objects in question. "E=mc2", as an inscription on paper, is *not* poetic, or, rather, the qualities that, it seems, you would consider fundamental to its essence (a linear relationship between matter and energy) contribute nothing to the poetry. "E=mc2" is as poetic as "E=c2/m", a decidedly nonphysical, nonsensical relationship. Indeed, "Emc2%^" will do, and that isn't even a well formed sentence in mathematical language -- it doesn't "follow a system", nor does it reflect anything outside of itself. But, I suppose, it does fulfill one of your requirements, in that it does sound good ("E em cee two percent caret").

I'm sorry if this e-mail is slightly testy; the needless and obfusticating blending of entirely different realms of human activity leads to things such as Sokal's _Social Text_ hoax. Not that I have anything against _Social Text_; it's an excellent journal, and I've had numerous occasions to cite its pages in my own work. But poetry deals with areas of human experience that are often a priori closed to scientific study, mathematical analysis, and the like. Phenominal consciousness, in other words. Richard Feynman is wonderful when he writes about science directly (the "Feynman Lectures", in three volumes, are part of the reason I'm out here Aricebo), but he didn't claim to write poetry, and was (jokingly or not -- it's hard to tell) quite hostile to art, considering it "effeminate" (his words).

I also suggest you clean up your notions of "fundamentally true", a valorizing phrase that often pretends to be describing when it is really self-defining. "As far as I know, only what is fundamentally true _can_ be expressed mathematically" is either patently false, or a definition, depending on your mood and whether or not, indeed, you do read poetry.

Mathematics is independent of history, or, rather, what a mathematician considers beautiful about it is independent of history. There may be certain epistemological accidents along the way, but it is the final form, stripped of confusion, that a mathematician searches for. Newton's calculus, as he wrote it, was ugly, full of imprecise concepts; it is calculus in its modern form that we consider beautiful. On the other hand, Keats' (or, to be a little more "hip", but not much, Pound's) archaicisms -- "faery", Doria -- are beautiful, and "modern editions" of Chaucer can kindly kiss my ass.

        well, Bob - number one, I disagree; but #2, the whole issue here
        is the licensing path the FCC has chosen for these microstations,
        viz., charging application and engineering fees that are equal to
        the fees they ask of wealthy broadcasting corporations - in effect
        making it $$ prohibitive for independents and communities to take
        advantage of the technologies you're talking about, except by
        operating illegally. it's a catch-22 the FCC has instituted, and in
        the name of protecting the citizenry from - wha, spies and aliens?

        booga booga. no, as far as I'm concerned this is just another
        visible (audible) foreclosure of localized public discourse in
        favor of media conglomerates and the consumerist imperative...

        btw - for somebody who, as I recall, is vehemently anti-gun control,
        you're sure hungry to get the feds up everybody else's ass, aren't
        you?

I will send in mine. Hope this (right) recourse works, but if not may a

I think that was put together by Magda Cregg. There was a reading of that book
and a celebration last fall. I remember this because Albert Saijo said he had
a reading "across the street" the same evening. City Lights may have been one
of the locations and it might have been Nov 11. An odd coincidence I remember
thinking, because Saijo and Welch were friends.

my dearly beloved H, i hate to have to confess it, but i've been deleting
unread most of the jordan/henry exchange, along w/ morpheal, gancie et al
who engage in *real* debate cuz i'm afraid to get drawn into something
that'll provide still another diversion from my ever receding "work."  so
i'll have to infer from this post what it is of yours that you think i'm
responding to.  there may be some such thing as "the work itself" but i'm
not smart enough to intuit it.  i need to use the various tools i've been
taught, which i've been taught in some context or other, so whenever i use
those tools i'm, um, deploying the conditions under which i learned them as
well, the values they represent and recreate etc. add to that, yes, an
appetite for weird language, tattered psyches and aesthetic
gratification...do those responses comprise a pure take on the "work
itself"?  anyway, i wasn't intending any personal dig or commentary on
something i'd not read.

That is not very original to MacEwen. Actually it was very prevalent.

The interests in the esoteric and occult were as strong as the other kinds
of quests for authenticity, freedom of expression, and radical lifestyles
as well as politics. Her quest for magick and ancient roots was a quite common
quest in that era. At least a renaissance of that theme. She was, in that
regard, one among many.

Some turned to the far east, some to shamanism and indigenous traditions,
and some towards more traditional western magick, as part of the growth of
eclectic comparative religions. Most departments of comparative religions,
and of eastern philosophies either grew substantially or got their start in
the 1960s. It was fashionable, trendy, and acceptable to delve and delve
deeply into such things.
Bookstores in Toronto were full of esoterica, occult, and eastern titles.
Poetry was rife with those themes. Everyone was reading the ancients and the
mystics.

MacEwen was a follower of those same fashions. She was not original. Her
poetry was often talented and original, but her philosoph and style of life
and thought were far from original.

So I wonder what you are really saying.

I happen to be reading Vendler's _Breaking of Style_ (which has a nice run through of Jorie Graham's poetry in it); the following quote might be helpful:

   "poets (along with other artists) are not
   primarily original thinkers; they ... generally think with (and
   against) the available intellectual categories of their epoch.
   Philosophers, rather than poets, invent the thought of their epoch." (8)

I think that makes succinctly the point I've been making in both e-mails I've sent out today. Poets are not philosophers nor (as was suggested the earlier post on "E=mc2") are they mathematicians. Nor, I suppose, are they lifestyle models a` la Vogue as you seem to suggest, Morpheal, replete with styles of dress and home furnishings.

I seem to be working primairly in negative space today, which is unfortunate. Over the weekend, if anybody is interested, I can try to dig out some old work of mine (some of which is avalible on my page listed below.)

Remember "Plato" in America was an A.I. machine that assassinated, in effect,
its own programmer. (The programmer committed suicide.)

I can see irresponsible micro stations run by people with ideological
aggendas and axes to grind, driving people to suicide. Would the micro
stations then be the murderers ?

In the USSR and similar totalistic regimes innuendo on radio and television,
subliminal or otherwise, is suspected of being a major cause of suicide.
Their suicide rates were extremely high. Unofficially even higher. Not to
mention the many deaths from suspicious causes, mostly occuring during the
victims employment. Murder by radio decree that became disguised as industrial
accidents ?  We suspect so.

Could it happen here ?   With unlicensed micro stations in anyone's hands,
definitely it could, and in too many ways to count.

The psychology is too complicated to discuss. It would take an advanced
degree in psychological warfare to understand it. And you cannot get one of
those. So we will pass on that subject.

As a rich artist perhaps I should answer your questions, which, of
course, answers two of your questions. Enthousiasmos is the sign of the
truly rich. This can be found similar to the way Cynghanedd works on the
senses.

Billy probably knows that Patchen had this. I do not teach in academia.

This, of course, is not true. The dominant ideas of an epoch are often
invisible to succeeding epochs. What we take to have been the dominant
ideas are often scarcely noticed or overwhelmingly contested in their own
time.
The dominant ideas are a product of the society's expression as a whole.
That includes economic and historical forces, scientific thought, aesthetic
structures, the usually unsystematic but often highly original and
influential thoughts of poets, changes in the technologies of agriculture
and animal husbandry, changes in sexual mores, and a whole lot more.
Philosophers, among others, systematize the thought of their time, which is
often their chief, and very great, originality.

There is no such thing as a society.
That is an artificial, idealist, construct created by sociologists.

In the sense that societies do not think, perceive, emote, or effect.

What a society is is simply the whole of all the communicative interactions
of all the individuals who happen to be considered as a group. The whole
planet could be a society. North America could be a society. Yourtown
could be a society. We usually consider a society to be the communicative
interactions of individuals with each other, but we might also consider the
actions that in any effect anyone else who is of that same group as being
somewhat communicative. We find similar patterns of similar communicative
interactions among identifiable groups that share similar learning, similar
experiences. That is what tends to result in that kind of grouping. However,
categorical discussion does not in fact create an entity.

The main point is that a society is not an entity. It is not an entity in
the very same way as an economy is decisively not an entity. A society is
not a monster that does something to someone, or that someone can do
something to. No one can do anything to a society anymore than a society can
do anything to anyone. It is always the responses of individual human beings
that effects and is effected. People invariably have various effects on
other people, but it is NEVER a Society or and Economy that is the effector.
It is always someone or a group of someones. It might be quite a few acting
similarly, even following each other very blindly and thoughtlessly, but it
is always someone.

It is you. It is I. It is him over there. It is her over there. It is that
crowd of people. It is this crowd of people It is human beings as
individuals. Society as such does not express. Individuals express.
Individuals are sometimes variously affected by other individuals. Simply
because this tends to chain, or domino, in various situations, does not make
that chain reaction or domino effect down the human line, the monolithic
response of a society. It is still individual reactions. We cannot reduce
that away from individual intentionalities. A society does not have any
intentions. People have intentions.

When individuals agree to certain rules, by acquiring knowledge of them and
intentionally consenting to follow them, that too is part of the
communicative interaction of individuals with each other. Society does not
teach and society does not learn. Only individuals teach and learn. Neither
does society follow trends or creat trends. Individuals do that too.

We are all in that together. You might follow me. I might follow you.
All of it is simply what we do.

The costs are as high for micro stations as they are for the larger one's in
terms of what the FCC has to do so as to be fair to everyone involved. I was
simply saying that responsibility in broadcasting is not automatic. Station
management is responsible because they are forced to be responsible and they
hate it because it costs them potential profits to do it. There are controls
on what they can do and what they cannot do. Why should micro stations have
more freedom than the larger stations ?  Why should small be allowed to do what
the larger stations cannot do ?  Why should someone else pay for the costs
of monitoring, licensing, micro stations other than the people who want to run
them ?

It is easier to get a shortwave license and operate a shortwave station.
It has a smaller audience, but even there there is licensing and there are
rules to follow. Why should micro stations not have licensing and shortwave
has to be licensed ?  I cannot see your logic. The people who run shortwave
stations are generally private individuals and the shortwave transmitters
are harder to use for the kinds of questionable purposes that micro station
equipment can be used for.

If unlicensed micro stations are allowed I can see a lot of implications:

1). personal vendettas using micro stations
2). slander using micro stations
3). infiltration of other frequencies by illigitimate users to gain
    influence over larger audiences
4). businesses being ruined by micro stations (it is amazing how much
    damage the irresponsible comments of one radio station can do to a
    small to medium sized legitimate business).
5). potential blackmail and fraud schemes being run using micro stations
6). every would be messiah, political fruitloop, white sheet over head,
    racist, fascist, cultist, millenialist, wacco, nut will want one, and
    many will get one to use in their private little wars
7). the other side will want them also, until the waves are jammed with
    head to head combatants.

Is that what you want to happen ?

Maybe someone will dislike the cut of your jib, or decide he wants your
girlfriend, or your job, and run YOU out of town using his micro station.

Will you have any idea what _hit_ you ?  You will only know that your world
suddenly collapsed, and people being how they are, all changed their minds,
including your best "friends" about being friendly. Even your own family
changed their thinking. It is surprising how people follow the subliminal
and the not so subliminal waves. No one will come to your parties anymore.
They will spit on you on the street. Why ?  Because Mr. Radio told them to.
That's all there is to it.

I know of experiments that proved it. They also proved how the Soviets did
it to their own people. The mechanisms of the innuendo.

A free for all would be even worse than that. I cannot tell you the other
applications that the technologies can be used for. I can only tell you
that the Soviet KGB and Hitler's Third Reich knew what to do with it.

The original reason I posted this quote was because Morpheal criticized Gwen MacEwen for "unoriginality of philosophy", as if this discounted the poetry. Simply because an artist does something that appears to arise from the dominant thoughts of the time (or against -- note that Vendler's point is essentially Hegelian) is not a criticism of the poetry. Pound, like many of his contemporaries, fell for a poorly thought out and essentially bogus theory of Chinese poetry promulgated by Fenollosa; unlike his contemporaries, he wrote the Personnae. He was, to be even more "unoriginal", often a raving Fascist; he wrote the Cantos. His poetic work, however "original" in a poetic sense, is hardly groundbreaking philosophy in the way of a Plato or Kant. Do you agree with this?

Certaintly true. What's often very revealing (and what was my first introduction to this effect) is reading the critical analyses of earlier epochs in the intervening space -- the 19 century take on the 18th century world, for example. Not the original thinkers of the time -- Nietzsche is not the best source for the 19th century opinion of the Greeks -- but the slow, plodding scholars of the universities, making their careful and finally incoherent way through the past.

> The dominant ideas are a product of the society's expression as a whole.

As for the details of "where ideas come from", I've found Foucalt's (deconstructive) notion of discourse in Hist of Sex and Archeology to be the most appealing to me for some time. I've read and written some New Historicist criticism which I've found to be very enlightening, and a refreshing change from the "professional courtesy" that scholars sometimes extend across the centuries. For those unfamiliar with/interested in New Historicism, check out the work Stephen Greenblatt does with Shakespeare -- a radical contextualization that brings in:

> ... economic and historical forces, scientific thought, aesthetic
> structures, the usually unsystematic but often highly original and
> influential thoughts of poets, changes in the technologies of agriculture
> and animal husbandry, changes in sexual mores, and a whole lot more.

I guess the reason I brought in the quote from Vendler's book is that I wanted to counter the centrifugal bullshit effect that usually takes place when different areas of knowledge are collided. (No offense meant to anyone on the list; I admire Vendler's style of criticism a great deal, but, as with any critic or philosopher, something is lost in translation.) The elision of poetry and mathematics, poetry and "knowledge of the natural world" can be wonderful things, but they are secondary effects. You don't sing Schrodinger's equation, and if you subtract one from both sides, you aren't multilating it. These mergings ignore the fact that poetry deals with *language*, and language was (amazingly enough) used before literary criticism existed. It has a history, a chronological structure where (as Faulkner might say) WAS is IS.

"It [Structural primitives] looks like the approach represents a naive
transfer to AI research of methods that have succeeded in the natural
sciences. Winograd characteristically describes his work in terms
borrowed from physical science:
We are concerned with developing a formalism, or "representation," with
which to describe...knowledge. We seek the "atoms" and "particles" of
which it is built, and the "forces" that act on it."---Mind Over Machine

"In a pervasive change of the cultural mind in the seventeenth century,
a complex descriptive model was substituted for nature. The model was a
formal system or linguistic machine--in contemporary jargon, a computer

---
"Indeed, physical theories about the universe can be built up by
modelling relatively simple and isolated systems and then making the
model gradually more complex and integrating it with models of other
domains. So much is possible because all the phenomena are presumably
the result of the lawlike relations of a set of basic elements, what
Papert and Minsky call "structural primitives".
This idea doesn't work in AI. There workers confused two domains, which
we shall distinguish as universe and world. A set of interrelated facts
may constitiute a universe, like the physical universe, but it does not
constitute a world...."---Mind Over Machine, Dreyfus'---cp

The stoopid questions are among the best.  Delighted that Peter started
this one rolling.  The connection with barter is one I'd like to keep
having received brilliant poems in ms or chapbook or indeed perfect bound
format as exchanges.

Also Bill Marsh's point of the chapbook length poem is spot on.  As Charles
Alexander said, the format can accommodate from 4 pp upwards and so
completely sidesteps plastic injection moulding approach to composition.
(Incidentally, I've devised a method of sewing up to 100 pages in one
signature - although 64 is probably a more reasonable upper limit.  Am
working on a leaflet explaining how it's done. Backchannel if anyone'd like
a copy. )

Brent,

here's a wonderful site:

http://www.nebula.simplenet.com/cohen/indez.html

it's an unofficial, wide-ranging look at Cohen's work & life.
There's also _The Blackening Pages_ (which is what Cohen
calls the process of writing/editing). There are some interviews
(some in real audio), and lots of great graphics.

Best,

Anthony

This may well have been covered before I came online, but what
do people think of Bloom's intro to the 1998 Best of the Best
anthology? I've got the Rich anthology and thought there were
some good poems in it, but it's nowhere near my favourite.
That would be either the Simic or Tate selections. His comments
were certainly provocative: "I failed to discover more than
an authentic poem or two in it" & "... a monumental representation
of the enemies of the aesthetic who are in the act of overwhelming us.
It is of a badness not to be believed..." I'm keen to hear
people's reactions to that particular year's selections,
and Bloom's inflamatory essay.

Again, if this has been discussed, the dead horse gets the message...

One of the most wonderful things about Gwen MacEwen was what she could do
at a reading. She didnt even carry a copy of her book, but recited her long
lines from memory. I think she wrote the titles of the poems she would read
on her hand.

The last time i saw her I was sitting in a cafe on Bloor Street in Toronto,
and Gwen came by on her big black clunky English one-speed bicycle.

She and bp Nichol died the same year, and tore the heart right out of us.
Toronto poetry just disappeared for five years, just disappeared.

Ah yes, _Stranger Music_ But isnt that a kind of selected? And isnt it
mainly song lyrics? Is there new stuff in it? One thing I know. You'll have
noticed that Cohen usually made each poetry book be a BOOK, not a
collection.

I am trying to remember, and I think it was in _Books in Canada_, so one wd

When, especially in the history of broadcasting, has "competition" ever
been "fair"?  It's the dominant system precisely because it benefits and
sustains an unequal condition.  Bigger competes better--but this is stati=
ng
the obvious.  Is it fair that tiny embattled Dunifer, who goes out of his=
 way
to have his tiny little signal not come close to the big boys' (which is
merely a politeness because--as is the case ideologically as well--the =
big
signal *always* erases the small one), should have to go through the same
process as the non-local (Murdoch?) multi-billion dollar EBI?  How would
"fair" competition negotiate size? (<--that's a real question)
"It's a level playing field, except for those who own it."  CB (from "Lik=
e
This"... I think)

But what waffle is this:

So speaking then actually endangers free speech?!?!

Your answer, as always although you couldn't put like this, is that "our"

is simply better than everyone else's ideology.  And that (ironically)
because it's better it should be specially protected--see the Endangered

ideology except for personal consumption.

Radio Havana (Cuba), "Broadcasting from free territory in the Americas",
every evening on 6010 Short Wave.

>>Non licensed, non accountable, non logged, stations do need to be
tracked
down technologically and eliminated.<<

Little needs to be said about your (what else can I call it?) neo-fascism=
, but
I do want a few words about this "tape logging" and "content monitoring"
you're on about.  With ten years (licensed) radio experience in two state=
s I
have *never* encountered this tape logging as you describe it.  *Written*
transmitter and EBS logs and play-lists must be kept, but stations don't
make tapes and then mail them to the FCC--anxiously awaiting a pat on the
head from Big Brother.  The real barrier, the real filter, the real censo=
rship
is precisely that of getting a license.  It costs *thousands* (maybe now
*tens of thousands*) of dollars in legal and engineering fees (going
primarily into non-local pockets) to start up a new station.  But the rea=
l
dissuasion is the time this takes--we're talking years!  (One group in
Buffalo has been waiting seven years--maybe eight by now--for the initial
engineer survey of the spectrum to be completed.)

Content is not monitored from above, the only overt restriction being the
"community standards" internalized by the station head honchos (dirty
words, etc.).  But the real girdle around radio that is local in content =
(or
unusual in form) is participating in this kind of "Godzilla eat Dog"
competition so celebrated by you.  This is happening (obvious if you list=
en)
on "non-commercial" radio as well--an adoption of programming formulas
which marketing analysists can "demonstrate" (to advertisers or
underwriters) produces and "holds" a steady audience of "consumers" (not
merely "listeners"--an important distinction in the discussion of radio
"democracy").  (Aside:  Deregulation in the 80s did much to harm local
content by reducing "public service" requirements and eliminating the
requirement for news staff, opening the door for completely canned
stations.)

THIS IS *VERY* BAD NEWS FOR **POETRY**!  Obviously.  As it, as
some have suggested here recently, can resist (it is certainly seen as
resisting by station and program managers!) commodification, it is
approached by default as "bad radio".  Hence efforts to commodify it to =
fit
into a holy format are prevalent (and even "well-intentioned) but usually
(for me) unbearable.  This typically gives poetry a kind of MTV-treatment=
,
wrapping it up in irrelevant and schlocky music.




Bob Holman, you have other experiences in this sphere I'm sure.  Please
tell me I'm not a crank (if you're listening).

Be well,
Martin

I don't believe Charles is right here, if he intends this as a correction
of my post....(what's "artforum"???  no no just kidding!! but in fact i've
hardly ever glanced at it...)

In your particular city, it may look one way, but the shape of the plastic
arts (i love that term) as a national/international market is something
else.  Of course almost no viz artist is gonna become the next big thing!!
But the way the art market shapes particular life-choices, and the work
itself, and how it impacts our overall conception of "what art (and
artists) are"--these things do follow a dynamic predicated on the idea of
actual remuneration for creative work.  Not so with poetry.  Different set
of structural expectations..

However Charles, i agree strongly that the situation with much writing
(the kind of mainstream conservative novelist who hopes to be published by
Doubleday or Ferrar or Knopf or something, and get reviewed in NYR of B
and the NY Times) is quite comparable to that of painters etc.  There is
an actual market, and the possibility of serious earnings for one's work;
but not that many will ever get a glance in a middlebrow flagship pub like
NYR, let alone win a Nobel.  Just as most viz artists aren't gonna be able
to live off the sale of their works, any time soon.

What interests me is the disparity between how our culture defines an
art-activity in one medium, and how in another..... as a life-choices, as
a social roles.

****WHAT I"M REALLY GETTING AT, eventually, is--that i think these things
impact on our specific strategies as poets.  The radical seriousness
within political passion of Susan Howe; the radical playfulness of
Bernstein within a problematic of how form self-secretes in a disturbed
historical moment; the open field of jazz-painting with words-as-things,
in Coolidge.  None of that, none of the poetry that matters, would exist
if there were worries about conforming to a market esthetic.  Likewise the
ludic ploys jumping around on the edge of what-is-poetryland that are the
work of Grenier (publication in small editions on sets of cards,
publication in holograph, etc.) Likewise various publication innovations
like, oh i dunno, Gestalten, a mag with a lot of vizpo and striaght
textual stuff as well, that comes in an envelope, on various sheets and
bundles of pages of various sizes, in various configurations, etc.  A
truely immoderate extension of the idea of a poetry magazine.  Various
things that people are starting to do on the web, etc.

Neither Malley nor Yasusada would ever have set spectral pen to paper,
were it not for the specific set of (non-commercial) expectations that

>The original reason I posted this quote was because Morpheal criticized

poetry.

To the contrary. I was discussing what makes poets popular within their
lifetimes. I was not discounting her poetry. If anything I complimented her
writing, but discounted the other aspects. If those extraneous elements had
been absent, I contend, that we would not even know of her today. That is
the crux of the matter. (In fact I long ago found some first strong
attractions to poetry in MacEwen's writings, as I did in Ginsberg's, and a
few others. MacEwen's were wonderful poems and still have that attraction.)

If anything poets tend to be eclectic borrowers, philosophically. It is
quite traditional, and not always a bad thing to be, as long as oneself
remains critical as to what oneself accepts and rejects as one's own within
that eclecticism. We can learn many things, but we do not have to accept all
that we learn as one's own, even if it is true for some others. This has the
most to do with customs and beliefs, or worldviews (political, economic,
religious).

I do not want to comment too deeply on Ezra Pound's politics. I do not believe
that the definitive study of that subject has been written. I do not believe
that anyone with a purely English Literature interest and experience, no
matter how deep and advanced, will be able to write that study. There are
far too many political innuendos coded within linguistic layers of the text.

We might, for simplicity say that Pound, alike to William Burroughs, wrote
reports. Referring to Burroughs saying that the only difference between
intelligence agents and writers is that "writers write reports".

Pound put his head into Spanish, in effect European, fascism, and correlated
the experience quite profoundly against American political history. His
words appear full of dire warnings. We have to remember the time period. We
have to consider locality. We have to understand what happens when an
American poet puts his head into a foreign place. I would be very cautious
about becoming critical of Pound's intentions, unless being sure what those
intentions really were.

(Here I am, expressing beliefs again. I must say, quite aside, that I
attempt to distinguish pure fact from where there are elements of belief and
all the facts are not stated. We normatively function on the basis of
grounded beliefs. That is, beliefs that have some facts supporting them. We
tend to forget that there is an element of belief, and I like to emphasize
that distinction whenever possible. To the annoyance of few who believe that
they speak only from facts.
I also use "believe" or "opinion" to indicate where some of the facts remain
in the realm of the unsayable, for whatever reasons. However, I will rarely
say that there are such facts, but leave the reader guessing as to which
usage of "belief" I happen to be referring to. In other words we sometimes
use "belief" to avoid telling the whole story, and spelling out all the
incantations that go with the particular magickal effect that is in
question. Nevertheless, the magick remains a science and far from the realm
of irrational belief.)

The Greeks provided an accessible, apparently better, way of dealing with
19th century technological advances and their utilization. A better way
than, for example, Christianity provided. The Greek architects and
engineers, began to have an influence upon the new materials. It is as
though the rise of technology cracked the prevalent worldview and not only
allowed other worldviews in, but in fact invited them into the somewhat void
bewilderment that followed innovation.

I have yet to know of a convincing story as to how Shakespeare was able to
build a theatre and have performed those plays that he had performed, under
the totalism of the then monarchy. We seem to lack the true links that
connect Shakespeare to the crown. That is a most interesting political
question. Any other man would likely have been beheaded for any similar
audacity in that era.
What gave old Bill his privilege ?  As far as I know, and I am no scholar on
the subject so I might be in ignorance, no one has ever satisfactorily
answered the question of how did Bill get away with it, and essentailly why.
(I have some theories, but they are only theories based on parallels within
tradition.)

> poetry deals with *language*, and language was (amazingly enough) used
before >literary criticism existed. It has a history, a chronological
structure where >(as Faulkner might say) WAS is IS.

Definitely, even if much of the formative chronology can only be guessed at,
because language evolved as spoken language rather than as written. Writing
was rare and more conservative, for the longest time. However, we can often
learn more about our ancestral history from what I would refer to as a
"deconstruction" of language than we can learn from many historians. We can
find the patterns of thought that historians often politely avoid
mentionning. We can find that our ancestors were not as noble, and more
savage, than we would like to believe. We can find elements that point, even
if vaguely, at some of the traditions and customs that we still are prey to,
even if in a more idealist manner than the direct, materialized, forms of
actions common to the past.

For example when we burn or flame someone we no longer, typically, do it by
tying them to a wooden stake and heaping dry timbers around them to which we
then toss a light. When we grill someone we do not put them on a 'barbeque"
and actually roast them. Our ancestors did not know any different than a
grilling, roasting, or flaming, is what it is. A metaphoric, or idealized,
meaning would have been mostly incomprehensible to them.

I find it humourous that we refer to the idea of taking it literally as
being a fault. We rightly value depths of meaning as presented in language,
but this misleads us about the past, and that is what is humourous. In fact
the past was more a matter of taking it materially, as enacted fact or as
material phenomenon, distinct from our own emphasis upon literal as
metaphor, analogy, simile, and other similarly idealized nuances. The
increased tendency towards idaelism is a more modern phenomenon and we tend
to read it into the past, the same way as some find modern rockets depicted
in ancient Egyptian monuments.

Of course writing was edict. It was the word of the lord to be made into
flesh, but in a very unmetaphoric manner. It was the command to be enacted
as action. It was to be taken literally. There was no idealization possible
in that either. So now we strive to maintain that language is more properly
an idealist representation, not to be taken literally. Ah, the
ironies....which are in fact reminiscent of the dungeons of long ago and
ancient conflicts of wars where a man's iron was tested as iron implement,
and not as much as purely willpower or the matter of character.

Mark,

I like the way you outline the choices poets make in their work,
attributing causation for such choices to the lack of real market
expectations of that work. I think that is at least partially correct,
although I would be disturbed to think the no-market reason (or, for visual
artists, the yes-market reason) was the only causation for what kinds of
work gets made. But I still think your characterization of the art world,
and its relation to the high-art market, is nearly as limited in its view
as if one were to look only at literature through the world of money-making
books and their relation to the literary market.

A lot of artists are engaged in a lot of different things. Book arts, mail
art, muralists' art (almost entirely publicly subsidized, but, in my
experience, most money which goes to muralists' work barely pays, and
sometimes doesn't pay, for paint, preparation of surfaces, and other such
necessities), and much more, are all part of what visual artists do, and
one could say that these choices, too, are made because there are no
"market" possibilities for artists so engaged. A portion of the 1970's
explosion in "artist's books" as a medium was directly due to the sense of
many artists that the gallery system was closed to them, and there was a
need to create art which was inexpensive to make and to buy, easily
distributable/highly portable outside the existing art market systems, and
which could get close to its audience in ways which were nearly impossible
for more traditional forms of art. One could say that there are forms in
poetry and visual art which intend to be oppositional to the existing
market structures. Whether they are or can be successful in this opposition
is a more problematic matter, it seems to me.

None of what I say denies your point that a lot of artists (and perhaps
most) have expectations of selling their work, at some level, for some
remuneration, and that it is the overall art market which gives these
artists such expectations.

For Chris Alexander (& any others)

A few of Gwen MacEwen's books, some of them (most out of print & all
published only in Canada):

A Breakfast for Barbarians (1966; still one of her finest)
The Shadow-Maker (1969)
Magic Animals selected poems (1974; 1984)
The Fire Eaters (1976)
The T.E. Lawrence Poems (1982; an amazing reading through of his writing'him)
Afterworlds (her last book, 1987; maybe still available from McClelland &
Stewart)

& a two volume selected from a few years ago published by Exile Editions,
maybe still available.

Since I mentioned it, here's the poem dedicated to Duncan from Afterworlds:

The Lion
        for Robert Duncan

To love is to be remarkable, and flawless.
It is to wear the yellow crown of a flawless beast
Forever.

It is to inhabit the flawless and exceeding universe
Forever.

It is to summon the wonderful numbers
Which add up to the mighty stars.
It is learning to divide and multiply by these numbers.

I swear by all the famous, ancient lions I have known
That the mighty children yet to come
Will foster fiiner stars,

For they are the true lords, born of morning,
Whose coming will call us down
Like a deck of cards.

To love is to be remarkable, and flawless.
It is to wear the yellow crowns
Of all the gods.


This kinda shows her strengths & weaknesses both.

And might explain Phyllis Webb's ambiguous elegy:

Gwendolyn NacEwen  1941-1987


Gwen, I didn;t know it had been so bad, such a long way down these past
months to the _Afterworlds_, or that the door and the blue wings opened and
closed in that sound of death you said you knew the tune of. Your last
poems so big with cosmos & semen & gold -- and I'm afraid adjectives that
came too easily over the years: _terrible_, _splendid_, _fabulous_,
_wonderful_, _remarkable_, _dark_, _mighty_, -- all of which you were as
your cat waited to take over the typewriter and get on with its sublime
works while you were out colliding with Barker Fairley in a metaphysical
blizzard or handing a coin to the ferryman for the last ride.

_The Loneliness of the Long Distaance Poet_. _Red Curtains_. _The White
Horse_. _Late Song_. _A Stillness of Waiting_. _The Death of the Loch Ness
Monster in the vast spaces of the subatomic world where matter has a
tendency to exist... Here where events have a   tendency    to occur..._

As you lay there dying in seizure was it your lord Life or your lord Death
who came to collect a last poem as you careened into _the beautiful
darkness_? nd was it really beautiful? Tell me. Was it dark? Or did the cat
get your last fabulous word?


But then I often enjoyed MacEwen, loved some of her work, but I am *always*
in awe of Webb...

I've been off list for a while, and was just wondering what the context
was for Patrick Pritchett's recent comments on Zukofsky.  As I read
them, they seem commensurate with all too much that gets said about LZ
-- biographical supposition instead of critical engagement with the
poet's work.  So what if he didn't swim or ride a bike until thirty; who
is any of us to say that in marrying Celia he chose the wrong woman
(and, even if he did, so what); and, why does "clarity" get elided with
confessionalism?  You'll notice that only the last of these three has
anything at all to do with his poetry.

I may be taking these comments in completely the wrong way, so I'll just
stop and ask for context before I go into a diatribe about the state of
Zukofsky scholarship, and what I see as at stake in his work -- what
this particular kind of clarity means, and how I believe it is
profoundly (and sometimes comically) achieved in his poems.

Charles:

Actually your comments are quite accurate.  Yes, there are lots of viz
artists who inhabit (who create for themselves) a world much like that of
poetry, with practices and values that reject commodity definitions of
worth.  My failure to acknowledge that was due to my intense interest in
running down certain thoughts I was having about the situation of poetry,
which were being clarified in my head somewhat by thinking about what made
our situation  **different**  from that of other arty types...

But yes you're quite right:  i was simply failing to remember soemthing i
know well, namely that much viz art production is anchored in values much
like those of the poetry world, with concern for the activity and
(perhaps) its products being foremost, and little belief in the values of
marketplace and of the celebrity machinery.

A good example of tunnel vision, resultant from staring too hard at one
group of ideas only!

You're perfectly right to say so, Robert. To place it in context, I was
merely relaying remarks made by Rakosi about LZ at a panel here at Naropa
the other day. More really in the nature of gossip than anything else. Carl,
afterall, is 96 years old. Perhaps the urge to rehash old gripes with his
dead compeers is just too much to resist.

I've been off list for a while, and was just wondering what the context
was for Patrick Pritchett's recent comments on Zukofsky.  As I read
them, they seem commensurate with all too much that gets said about LZ
 -- biographical supposition instead of critical engagement with the
poet's work.  So what if he didn't swim or ride a bike until thirty; who
is any of us to say that in marrying Celia he chose the wrong woman
(and, even if he did, so what); and, why does "clarity" get elided with
confessionalism?  You'll notice that only the last of these three has
anything at all to do with his poetry.

I may be taking these comments in completely the wrong way, so I'll just
stop and ask for context before I go into a diatribe about the state of
Zukofsky scholarship, and what I see as at stake in his work -- what
this particular kind of clarity means, and how I believe it is
profoundly (and sometimes comically) achieved in his poems.

Anthony, this is all news to me, so I feel underinformed . . .can you fill

edited by Harold Bloom? Is that what you're saying? If correct, please say
where these opinions may be read. Could you backtrack over this terrain &

c'mon chris don't be so hard on morpheal

There's a real danger of Americans getting off their asses & partaking of
public discourse.  Getting off their asses which are brainwashed from
consumerist conglomerate media (t.v. mostly, as the visual image is more
daunting psychologically, i think, with the added impact of sound) -- so
ranting agendas, attempted brainwashing even, would be a good sign as far
as i'm concerned.  A little public ranting helped get Nike to stop
exploiting child laborers, granted we're all brainwashed by the PC
rhetoric that made us care about the  relationship between our footware &
actual slave laborers.

i agree about the wave-thing -- why do you think I won't let us get a
microwave?  Those are regulated by the feds too & that's how you know to
stay away.

I agree with you especially about the fact the way the fcc favors
consumerist conglomerates -- i absolutely CAN NOT get "have a coke and a
smile" out of my brain & it makes me look so OLD to my students since I
stopped listening to commercial media years & years ago.

RADIO PIRATES IN ESCALATING WAR WITH RULES

by Richard Danielson

St.Petersburg Times, Nov 28, 1997

As he watched U.S. Marshalls pack up the transmitter at 102.1-FM, a Temple
Terrace garage-turned-outlaw radio station, disc jockey Eric "the killa"
Ericson didn't expect much sympathy.

But it still surprised him when a Federal Communication Commission official
laughed during the Nov. 19 raid and suggested the station's volunteers "find a
new hobby." "Some of us live for this," said Ericson, 25, of Temple Terrace.
"They're just laghing in our faces about it, thinking it's a big joke." To the
contrary, the FCC's raids on three local unlicensed radio stations -- one each
in Lutz, Temple Terrace and Tampa's Seminole Heights neighborhood -- were
anything but fun and games. They were, instead, but one local skirmish in a
nationwide guerilla war over so-called "pirate radio."

The dispute pits a growing band of radio renegades against the FCC and the
National Association of Broadcasters, one of the wealthiest and most powerful
lobbies in Washington. It also provides a case study in waht happens when
technology, government regulation, the quest for broadcasting profits and the
defiance of do-it-yourself broadcasters all end up on a collision course.

Look at the technology, and it appears that radio broadcasting stands today
where personal computing was five or ten years ago. The cost of low-powered
basic broadcasting equipment has come down to the point where a radio
enthusiast can put out a modest FM signal with mail-order components costing
about $500. The peripheral equipment needed to round out a broadcast setup can
run a few thousand dollars more.

Applying for a broadcasting license, however, is more expensive and can require
an initial investment of $100,000 or more.

"There is no question that the regulations as they're being implemented by the
FCC restrict the airwaves to the very rich," said Allen Hopper, a San Francisco
attorney for one of the best-known pirate stations in the country, Radio-Free
Berkeley. "You can't go on the air without being a millionaire, and that's
where micro-radio comes in. "Hopper said that the pirate radio movement has
"been gaining momentum for quite some time now." "There are literally hundreds
of stations on the air that we know of," he said.

But as pirate radio has grown both in popularity and boldness, commercial
broadcasters have complained that the new signals threaten to interfere with
their signals and confuse their listeners. In response, the FCC has stepped up
its enforcement methods. Where Hopper and his colleagues with the National
Lawyers Guild once heard of two or three stations being closed per month, it's
now 10. FCC spokesman David Fiske said the agency does not keep score on how
many pirate stations it closes, handling each microbroadcaster on a
case-by-case basis. Seizing equipment, as has been done in Tampa, happens when
warning letters are ignored."The FCC does make an effort to contact people and
get voluntary compliance," he said. "That is the major enforcement effort." For
radio pirates, trying to comply with FCC rules would inevitably lead to a
catch-22.

Micro broadcasters typically don't broadcast at more than 100 watts. In Tampa,
for instance, Kelly Benjamin's 89X, the Seminole Heights station shut down Nov.
19, broadcast at about 70 watts, meaning that the signal died about half-way
across Tampa Bay. The catch is that the FCC won't license a station with a
signal below 100 watts. With a finite number of frequncies available for use,
Fiske said federal policy tries to balance "how do you serve an entire
community and how many licenses can you pack in" the radio spectrum. Someone
could apply to change the FCC's rules regarding micro broadcasting, but that is
not something the FCC would do itself, and Fiske said "there is no such
proceeding under way." At the same time the number of pirate radio stations is
growing, the number of corporate owners of licensed radio stations is
shrinking, as broadcasting conglomerates like Westinghouse buy more and more
stations. One of the complaints against 102.1-FM came from WHPT, 102.5 FM,
which is owned by the rapidly growing Clear Channel Communications.

"One of the primary arguments that we've made is that the FCC's regs have
failed to keep up with these changes in technology," Hopper said. "If you look
at those complaints, they're not complaints about the interference with the
signal. They're complaints about, "Oh, our listeners are confused." WHPT
general manager Drew Rashbaum said he would not discuss his station's complaint
about 102.1-FM because he has been bombarded with harassing calls from
"obnoxious listeners" to the renegade stations ever since the raids.

Still, it's no surprise that the strongest opposition to pirate radio comes
from big broadcasters looking to increase their market share. "We're very
supportive of what they're doing," said Dennis Wharton, a spokesman for the
National Association of Broadcasters in Washington. "You can get these pirate
stations up and running, and it can create a lot of havoc with the airwaves and
existing stations." While the FCC's critics say the airwaves should be opened
to low-power radio, they doubt that will happen because of the influence of the
broadcasting lobby. "This is exactly in a democracy what we should be
encouraging, and we've basically got the FCC acting as the police force for the
fortune 500 companies," said Robert McChesney, a University of
Wisconsin-Madison professor who has written several books about the corporate
domination of broadcasting.

"In the short term I think the strategy should be this: We should ...have a
thousand, 2,000, 10,000 of these stations," McChesney said. "Sheer numbers will
force the development of the fair system. Radio in this country today is about
one thing: It's about taking Americans, turning them upside down and shaking
everything out of their pockets." But FCC officials say allowing everyone who
wants to get on the air to broadcast at once would create chaos and couls even
endanger lives. One of the chief arguments against unlicensed radio is its
potential for interfering with the transmissions of police and fire
departments.
Fiske said the FCC doesn't keep statistics on such incidents, but in October
the agency shut down two pirate stations near big airports in Miami and West
Palm Beach.

The founder of Tampa's 102.1-FM said that concern doesn't apply to him. Doug
Brewer, whose technical expertise has earned him grudging respect even from
some people at licensed stations, said the FCC never has indicated to him that
his signal was interfering with anyone else's. Brewer has applied for a
broadcasting license but can't get one for the low wattage he puts out.
Established broadcasters aren't eager to entertain changes that would give
licenses to micro broadcasters. Asked whether the National Association of
Broadcasters has a position on licensing micro broadcasters, Wharton focused on
the existing controversy. "The issue is simply about operating without a
license," he said. "That's the sole issue here. If you're not operating with a
license, you should not be in business."

Wednesday night I missed, alas, what one person described to me as an
extraordinary performance of poetry and music by Anne Waldman and Claude
Brown, revolving around various works and texts of John Cage.

On the bill for Thursday night's readings were Douglas Oliver, Eleni
Sikelianos, Andrew Schelling and Olga Broumas.

And let me clear up something right at the outset here: Doug Oliver in no
way meant to say that young writers of today have no anxieties to deal with.
What he meant was that their anxieties are different from the ones which the
previous generation had to cope with and that this in turn produces the
emergence of different poetic forms. (Honestly, some people are so picky!)
Let me clear up that last remark by stating emphatically and at once that
Douglas Oliver is a real sweetie. (Whew!)

Oliver's reading began with a selection of crisp, delicate elegies from a
work-in-progess called _Tenth Arrondissement_. He prefaced his reading by
remarking that the street he lives on in this district was once the home to
both Heinrich Heine, who lived at one end, and Paul Celan, who lived at the
other, observing that this chance polar arrangement, far from constituting a
mutual exclusivity, comprises a magnetic field of force - from limpid
clarity to the densest logos - in which the full range of poetic possibility
can form.

From "Forearms": (in part, a meditation on political violence) "one day
there's a youth's flayed arm but no youth."
From "A Little Night": (a lyrical turn on Celan) "hostility of moths around
the candles," "Our shadows lack performance ... they are a text created by
the dusty mirror." "the word I care about wakes ... Celan ... and performs
itself."
"Crystal Eagle" continued this theme - a terse, bittersweet homage to
Celan's life and death - "there's future silence in the non-forthcoming of
the Rue de Paradis."

"For Giselle Celan," a poem for Paul's widow, with whom Oliver shared many
meals before she died, and his closing piece, "Well of Sorrows in Purple
Tincture," (a sort of elegy for family) exemplified his poetic virtues in
the elegaic form, as I read them -- an elegant, finely felt diaristic
narrative that's light on its feet but covers a large amount of conceptual
territory with ease. But above all these poems are distinguished by the
conspicuous clarity of their compassion.
"See my father falling on the fairway of life. The whack gone out of the
game, the blood gone out of the brain."

***

Eleni Sikelianos read next, beginning with poems from "To Speak While
Dreaming." "These hand like crickets ... hold out for the slender boat ... I
do trust numbers enough to write their signs" - from a sonnet written while
Allen Ginsberg read early English poetry and the work of Smart.

Followed by work from the more recent "Book of Tendons." From "Gold Trout" -
"laying on top of heat's papers in a dress ... marigold, I wish the ground
were hot or not ... stars mar no man light as a feather therefore his
shoulders gather up light ... touched the bone button, brought the row house
down." "May was a cavernous month, a thing sweeter than a yam."

Then a poem entitled, after Montaigne, "Of Cannibals, Of Thumbs," which
Eleni described as "essays that never got anywhere." "When I think of sex
some people think of seals barking but I think of shrimp in bleach."

And in closing, a long portion of a work-in-progress tenatively titled, "The
Booklet of My Dream of Living in California." Which figures partly as a
place of fable, and offers such delightful lines as these,  "in which
Alexander the Great invented the caterpillar personally." "My dream of
seeing Michael Douglas in an elevator. Not that satisfying." "Like El Nino
doing a brodie in the air."

A languid, serpentine history of California as Eden and desert. The growth
of the pain of the nomad self in its intersections with geography -
geography as both personal and public history. Marked, like all her
distinctive, inventive work, by percussive turns and slippery cadences, the
sense of floating enigma, now enlarged, now contracted, where language is
the play and element of riverine wit and seduction.

Andrew Schelling began his reading with a poem dedicated to Allen Ginsberg.
It ranged widely: from the London house where Blake wrote "Jerusalem" and
"Milton," (and where the custodians were replacing the forge with the hard
drive) to the Rocky Mountains.  From Blake's immortal tyger - the first
lines of which Schelling translated into Sanskirt - a startling effect,
making it even more tygerish! - to the American cougar. "Frame old
symmetries [with] new poems."

This was followed by a series of haibuns-in-progress. From Black Earth:
"sweet taste of dharma not for humans alone." From Western Tanager: "If
mountains and rivers are the continent's Sanskrit, then birdsong is local
vernacular ... Your bards are wearing wingbands of gold." A haibun in which
the poet dreams he meets Don Allen, dying in a mosque. "And then I realize
the mosque is also his project, empty but for the black calligraphy." Raven
Haibun (for Jane & Anselm Hollo): "Raven says - there is going to be another
Judgment Day." And from other haibuns: "A peak called Quandary. A bar called
Rocky Flats." "Do not despise this forearm - it was Zebulon Pike's - a
grubby note attached says it tastes salty." "You ask how the gods toy with
we mortals? Go get a field guide to the tundra."

Andrew closed with translations from Classical Indian poetry, the earliest
dated circa 1000 BCE.
"Last night, what ecstasy - today she tosses her head and won't look at me."
"He steps into the moonlight and just for a moment it's like he's vanished
into another country."
"We make love in the common position - he calls it sedate. We try something
new and he asks where I've learned it."
"My wound begins to itch madly for love."

I think Schelling's work answers admirably to Charles Alexander's query to
the List of some weeks ago about where have all the nature poets gone? Along
with Jack Collom and Merrill Gilfillan, he belongs to a small company of
poets who are actively engaged with the rhythms and pulses of the natural
world. But I was particularly taken with his translations this time around.
Brief and deceptively simple, they convey an entire world of complex human
interactions, foregrounding the bitter and the sweet, what might be called
the eros of the quotidian, the ancient bedrock of poetry - where our endless
anxieties are allayed by the perpetual turn to, the renewal of, form.

***

Finishing the evening was the delightful and endearing Olga Broumas, who
began by reciting a brief, sweet lyric in honor of Rachel Blau DuPlessis.

Then some poems in homage to Sappho, who, she reminded us, wrote when God
was still a feminine deity. "Spasm my breaks downhill oak." "I am what
astonishment can bear, pupil only to you, fleece of dew." And from "Pastoral
Jazz," (I think) - "almost ultraviolet with so much witness - the garbage
trucks suspended in shy light." And a poem about her practice as a body
worker: "Always an angel rises from the figure ... I bow to riddle of the
ear ... helpless with harmonics." A poem called simply - "Instructions."
"One must be sitting in one's chair before smoking opium so that one will
not have to walk to it later." And from another poem - "the sun is full
today - swallow it all - merci." "For Bobbie Louise Hawkins (who mentioned
acid)" - "To relax all force and watch the free fall of what happens, the
fruit of it ... the string breaks, all is desire."

And finally, "Lumens." "To build a chair, to build a chair, to build a
chair. To sit. To sit. Witness the whole world."

Olga is the only poet I've seen on the Naropa stage to take a full bow. She
did it quite well. Her "Sappho's Gymnasium," written with T. Begley, remains
a source of constant wonder and delight. Like Elytis, whom she's translated
so brilliantly, her own work casts a spangled effulgence, a sun-drenched
radiance that is also brimming with the tenderness and the murky pith of the
chthonic. Hearing her read, you want to be Greek and sing - lilt, jangle,
stream. The mystery of the body wash over you, drown you in the deeps of the
body.

I know there's been some pretty heady competition for this award on the
list in the past, but I hereby nominate Patrick Pritchett as electronic
poetry reviewer par excellence!

(It would be fun to have an improvisational contest like the Heavyweight
Poetry Championships down in Taos for reviewers - people would be given,
say, ten minutes to compose a review of a certain book or reading - and
then have to post it to the list!)

Well, I thought it was fun when I started writing that sentence . . .

        Subject:  Re: Naropa Readings

        Wednesday night I missed, alas, what one person described to me
as an
        extraordinary performance of poetry and music by Anne Waldman
and Claude
        Brown, revolving around various works and texts of John Cage.

        On the bill for Thursday night's readings were Douglas Oliver,
Eleni
        Sikelianos, Andrew Schelling and Olga Broumas.

        And let me clear up something right at the outset here: Doug
Oliver in no
        way meant to say that young writers of today have no anxieties
to deal with.
        What he meant was that their anxieties are different from the
ones which the
        previous generation had to cope with and that this in turn
produces the
        emergence of different poetic forms. (Honestly, some people are
so picky!)
        Let me clear up that last remark by stating emphatically and at
once that
        Douglas Oliver is a real sweetie. (Whew!)

        Oliver's reading began with a selection of crisp, delicate
elegies from a
        work-in-progess called _Tenth Arrondissement_. He prefaced his
reading by
        remarking that the street he lives on in this district was once
the home to
        both Heinrich Heine, who lived at one end, and Paul Celan, who
lived at the
        other, observing that this chance polar arrangement, far from
constituting a
        mutual exclusivity, comprises a magnetic field of force - from
limpid
        clarity to the densest logos - in which the full range of poetic
possibility
        can form.

        From "Forearms": (in part, a meditation on political violence)
"one day
        there's a youth's flayed arm but no youth."
        From "A Little Night": (a lyrical turn on Celan) "hostility of
moths around
        the candles," "Our shadows lack performance ... they are a text
created by
        the dusty mirror." "the word I care about wakes ... Celan ...
and performs
        itself."
        "Crystal Eagle" continued this theme - a terse, bittersweet
homage to
        Celan's life and death - "there's future silence in the
non-forthcoming of
        the Rue de Paradis."

        "For Giselle Celan," a poem for Paul's widow, with whom Oliver
shared many
        meals before she died, and his closing piece, "Well of Sorrows
in Purple
        Tincture," (a sort of elegy for family) exemplified his poetic
virtues in
        the elegaic form, as I read them -- an elegant, finely felt
diaristic
        narrative that's light on its feet but covers a large amount of
conceptual
        territory with ease. But above all these poems are distinguished
by the
        conspicuous clarity of their compassion.
        "See my father falling on the fairway of life. The whack gone
out of the
        game, the blood gone out of the brain."

        ***

        Eleni Sikelianos read next, beginning with poems from "To Speak
While
        Dreaming." "These hand like crickets ... hold out for the
slender boat ... I
        do trust numbers enough to write their signs" - from a sonnet
written while
        Allen Ginsberg read early English poetry and the work of Smart.

        Followed by work from the more recent "Book of Tendons." From
"Gold Trout" -
        "laying on top of heat's papers in a dress ... marigold, I wish
the ground
        were hot or not ... stars mar no man light as a feather
therefore his
        shoulders gather up light ... touched the bone button, brought
the row house
        down." "May was a cavernous month, a thing sweeter than a yam."

        Then a poem entitled, after Montaigne, "Of Cannibals, Of
Thumbs," which
        Eleni described as "essays that never got anywhere." "When I
think of sex
        some people think of seals barking but I think of shrimp in
bleach."

        And in closing, a long portion of a work-in-progress tenatively
titled, "The
        Booklet of My Dream of Living in California." Which figures
partly as a
        place of fable, and offers such delightful lines as these,  "in
which
        Alexander the Great invented the caterpillar personally." "My
dream of
        seeing Michael Douglas in an elevator. Not that satisfying."
"Like El Nino
        doing a brodie in the air."

        A languid, serpentine history of California as Eden and desert.
The growth
        of the pain of the nomad self in its intersections with
geography -
        geography as both personal and public history. Marked, like all

        distinctive, inventive work, by percussive turns and slippery

Bob - okay, first of all, AGAIN, the issue isn't whether I think the
feds should regulate radio - though in that arena my modest proposal
is that $100, 000 + in initial licensing fees makes it pretty clear
who's being protected here, and it ain't us.

        second of all - I have no idea what yre talking about and suspect
(hope, wish) there's a bit of the old tongue-in-cheek going on when
you suggest that the real threat posed by pirate radio is - what?
electronic mind control? I wonder (but not too much) what it is you
think we get from the mainstream stations, then? Incidentally, radio
in your (highly questionable) examples,  the USSR and Nazi Germany,
was state-controlled; other voices would have been quelled as much as
possible.

and third - I'm amenable to toddbaron's gentle hint - arguing with
you about federal regulation of broadcast media doesn't have much to
do with poetry/poetics; the less polite version is, why make
this a drag for everyone and not just me?

I'll leave it, Gancie-style, with two quotations; our faithful
listeners out there can decide whether there's any feedback
between the words "commercial" and "public" :

"But as pirate radio has grown both in popularity and boldness,
commercial broadcasters have complained that the new signals threaten
to interfere with their signals and confuse their listeners. In
response, the FCC has stepped up its enforcement methods. "

        St.Petersburg Times, Nov 28, 1997
        (and thanks for sending that, William)

"Welcome to the FCC. The mission of this independent government
agency is to encourage competition in all communications markets and
to protect the public interest."

The association of margarine with sex pre-dates "Last Tango in Paris" (ok,
that was butter) by quite a few years. Is Land O' Lakes Butter (also
margarine) aware that by folding and cutting their Indian Maiden logo has
been made bare-breasted by at least three generations of little boys?
Given these associations it seems strange to commemorate the late princess
with what will surely in the vernacular be called "Diana Spread."
Sounds like a tabloid. Can she never be free?

As a person who has been run out of town by an individual using his
micro-station and replaced through a witness protection program perhaps
I should respond to this. Not to say my personal vendetta as an
illigitimate user hasn't caused infiltration of other frequencies and
mediums to gain influence over larger audiences. But as a messiah,
political fruitloop, white sheet over head, racist, fascist, cultist,
millenialist, wacco(sic), nut will want one, private little war kind of
guy this is what I am expected to do. The voices in my head never tell
me to mow the lawn but rather to ruin through my new micro station. I
have sacked three businesses so far with my food alert broadcasts or, in

David,

I was referring to the new (1998) Best American Poetry anthology
(Scribner Poetry - David Lehman, series editor) called
"Best of the Best". Bloom was asked to edit a best-of
from the 10 anthologies that make up the series, thus far.
(He's chosen 75 poems from 750.) My comments were focussed
on Bloom's intro to this Greatest Hits. I mentioned Simic
and Tate because I like their selections - Simic in 1992
& Tate in 1997 - not because they've commented on Bloom's
selection.

Best,

Anthony

"In modern times, one of the earliest concerns with mechanism is related
to attempts to develop a completely formal, content-free foundation for
mathematics. The "Hilbert program" is one of the most ambitious attempts
to build up mathematics by purely formal means, without regards to
questions of what the formalism was about. In the work of Frege, as well
as Russell and Whitehead, some of this enterprise was successful. On the
other hand, a great intellectual achievement of the modern age has been
the demonstration by purely formal means that the ULTIMATE GOAL OF
COMPLETE FORMALIZATION is, in principle, not achievable. (The original
work was done by Godel and susequently by Turing, Church, Post, and
others; see the collection of papers at Davis, 1965.)---from Computation
and Cognition by Zenon W. Pylyshyn---[Py]+[Ly]+[sHy]n--cp. What would a
purely formal, content free foundation for poetics look like? Lang-po?

Dear all--

If anyone wishes to contact me between next Tuesday, June 23 and Thursday,
July 30, I'll be at hitinfish@aol.com and not "here."  (I'll be on my
mainland moneyhoon with Bryant, who blushes to be immortalized by Bill
Luoma in Bill's wonderful new book.)  I'll be giving two readings while
"there": one at the Zinc Bar in NYC on June 28 at 6:30, with Douglas
Rothschild and another at Canessa Park in San Francisco on Sunday July 26.
Would be delighted to meet list folk in those two cities, and to catch up
with DC folks between July 3 and 8.  Will also be in St. Louis July 9-11
to catch my Cards (McGwire, yes, but also Lankford and Jordan and
DeShields and, above all, Willie McGee) and in other places too.
I'm tired already.  In the meantime, folks, have a wonderful list.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Someone, who was it?, wrote here recently that the avant garde means nothing to anybody and that, these days, it is merely 'academia lite.'

To equate the avant garde with an unlearned academy seems to me to assume that the edge of experimental, powerful writing is occuring solely in the academy. It also assumes that writing outside of the academy isn't as acute as within. Both assumptions are diseased.

> The original reason I posted this quote was because Morpheal criticized Gwen MacEwen for "unoriginality of philosophy",

You love to hate Morpheal. Get your facts straight. He said nothing such. Learn to read him correctly. He challenges you, you can't slot him accurately, and so you end up making erroneous attributions.

Douglas Barbour listed MacEwen's books and posted one of her poems, noting that the poem:

> kinda shows her strengths & weaknesses both.

Yes, but that poem shows more of her weaknesses than her strengths, surely. I read such stuff and passed over it. Quote any poet's less than interesting poems and you'll portray them poorly. Would you be so kind to post one of her best. I don't have her books here in Seattle, but how about the one from The Fire Eaters that ends with the two lines I quoted. Or a better one, if you know her work well Douglas, as you probably do.

I remember reading Phyllis Webb's ambivalent elegy in the Malahat Review or something such and being disappointed in Phyllis who must know that the poems that are less than brilliant are many. Is it relevant that Phyllis is gay whereas MacEwen espoused a mystical het that Phyllis must find very annoying and undoubtedly muddled and deluded? But MacEwen's mystical het was not the focus of her best poetry.

It saddens me that bill bissett is treated with even more disdain than Phyllis Webb summoned for Gwendolyn MacEwen. Stephen Scobie has been using the same line about bill bissett for years: "He's doing the same old thing." Probably Stephen has not read a line of bissett's in twenty years. I love bissett's work, read every book he writes, and find that his books are extrordinary and getting better and better, an amazing writer. But bissett, like MacEwen--as Morpheal pointed out--is in the Canadian 'peoples' poet' category, like Al Purdy (sage by now), and so is disdained unjustly by the academics who just don't get it in the same way that Ginsberg and the Beats were disdained down here. This is not to equate bissett's and MacEwen's work with the Beats, but the phenomenon is similar, the lines of conflict. It seems rather a
pointless conflict in Canada; bissett and MacEwen is/was widely receptive to all good things, to all projects of energy. bill's work is phenomenal, and so is he himself. He should be recognized, as bp Nichol recognized him, as "Canada's best political poet" (bp said that in my Honda) and as a really progressive force in the avant garde. He is more akin to Ashbery than Ginsberg in the way his poems turn on a dime from one mode of writing to another.

When I read Russian poetry (35 years ago) I remember being most struck by
the poet's status in society compared to English-speaking societies - somewhat
similiar to the differing status at that time of a soccer hero in Europe vs.
America.

The other thing that really hit me at that time - young and naive as I was -
was the impact their style had on me coming as I did to them from a rather
stuffy and strait-laced midwest schooling.  Now that I think about it, it
still does impact my work.

Charles and Mark - I also know a lot of struggling artists.  I can remember
when the first starving artist sales were really that rather than what they
have become.  I have not come across and "starving poets" sales - it might
work?

Thirdly, the articles for which she received her nominations for the

I'm not Luigi, and my information is mostly from a story on national public
radio, somewhat more (but admittedly not a lot more) than a television
blurb, with various comments from Smith's colleagues included in the radio
story, too. Seems that she invented sources and put words in their mouth,
to make some points. Particularly noted in the story I heard was a source
invented, and saying, about the mother of children who recently were found
after a multi-year kidnapping and life with their father, that, if they had
been this (imaginary) source's children, she would have turned heaven over
in order to find them. So, perhaps invented to help sway public opinion
against a mother perceived by Smith as not appropriately mothering? Hard to
say, when learned out of context. Still, seems like reprehensible behavior
by a columnist and definitely grounds for losing such a job, whether or not
it had anything to do with Pulitzer-winning articles. But it's also true
that the explanations from the paper about betrayal of the ethics of
journalism don't ring so clean in a time when it seems like journalistic
ethics aren't, and probably never were, what some pundits would hold them
up to be.

In a commercial newspaper, though, it's hard for me to imagine that these
matters have "NOTHING whatsoever" to do with money. I don't think Luigi's
comments were necessarily that Smith's actions had anything to do with her
own specific relations to money. As to what Luigi's sources were, he said
nothing about late news on television, so your censure of his comments seem
both ill-advised and mean-spirited.

2)  Here Here for Patrick Pritchett and his reports.  He makes life that

I've sent out a total of three e-mails to the list since I've been on it, so I don't think that's much of a pattern. I happen to disagree with Morpheal on this point (if I do understand his point, although, as you note, one way to avoid being contradicted is to tell your opponent that they can't understand you.)

The attention paid to a poet's "philosoph" or "lifestyle" is an inherently trivializing, assuming you're understanding the person in her capacity as a poet. When people do forget this, you get inane things like that New Yorker profile of Jorie Graham a while back, or the innumerable "amateur poets" who crowd the cafe's with not much more than an interesting face or titilating background.

Perhaps I took the thread in a slightly different direction than it appeared to be going; that simply seemed to me to be par for the course.

I didn't follow this controversy, didn't see the news report. For what it's
worth, here's La Smith's rather bathetic apologia courtesy of the Boston
Globe, followed by a few comments of mine.

A note of apology

                  By Patricia Smith, Globe Staff, 06/19/98

                  My father used to read me newspaper stories at bedtime.

                  Yeah, I thought it was weird, too. But I was so enamored
of him, so much
                  the dictionary definition of a daddy's girl, that I
obediently snuggled up              'neath the covers while he cracked open the
city section of the Chicago Daily
                  News and enthusiastically related tales of robbery,
murder, natural disasters,
                  and political malfeasance. The terse blocked type below
the headlines
                  became living, breathing stories. ''Where do you think
this woman was going
                  when she got robbed?'' my father would ask. ''What was in
her bag? Who
                  was waiting at home for her? Do you think the robber
feels guilty now?'' and
                  the stories would stretch infinitely in either direction,
without clear               beginnings or endings.

                  My daddy gave the newspaper a pulse. He taught me to love
its changing
                  canvas, its omnipotent eye, its infinite throat. And
since one long-ago tabloid
                  featured his obituary, it is much too late to apologize
to him for
                  compromising that love.

                  But it's not too late to apologize to you.

                  From time to time in my metro column, to create the
desired impact or slam
                  home a salient point, I attributed quotes to people who
didn't exist. I could
                  give them names, even occupations, but I couldn't give
them what they
                  needed most - a heartbeat. As anyone who's ever touched a
newspaper
                  knows, that's one of the cardinal sins of journalism:
Thou shall not fabricate.
                  No exceptions. No excuses.

                  And yet there are always excuses. Usually they point to
the cursed fallibility
                  of human beings, our tendency to spit in the face of
common sense, zigging
                  when the world says zag. Sometimes excuses reveal real or
imagined
                  inadequacies, or the belief that the world, if it is to
be conquered, must be
                  conquered singlehandedly.

                  I've already heard from dozens of people in search of an
official sound-bite,
                  a hook upon which to hang the newly fallen wordsmith. The
reason.

                  It may ring hollow - after the fact, excuses always do -
but I always believed
                  that I needed to do it all. Instead of popping out of
J-school in a nice, neat,
                  byline-ready package, I was fueled by a heady mixture of
naivete, ambition,
                  and an almost insane love for the powers of language. To
make up for the
                  fact that I didn't get that ''correct'' start in
journalism, I set out to be 10              times as good by doing 10 times as
much. Write columns. Author books. Write
                  and perform poetry. Make films. Pen and star in plays.
Gig at Scullers with a
                  jazz band. And as accolades poured in, I strained to
accomplish more.

                  But I didn't establish priorities, and the first casualty
was time. In Boston,                my face was my column. I wanted the pieces to
jolt, to be talked about, to                leave the reader indelibly impressed.
And sometimes, as a result of trying to                     do too much at once and
cutting corners, they didn't. So I tweaked them to
                  make sure they did. It didn't happen often, but it did
happen. And if it had
                  only happened once, that was one time too many.

                  I will survive this knowing that the heart of my columns
was honest and
                  heartfelt. None of the pieces considered for the American
Society of
                  Newspaper Editors award or this year's Pulitzer Prize
were doctored in any
                  way. I will write as long as I breathe, despite the dire
predictions that this
                  indiscretion spells the end of my career. In the course
of living this flawed
                  life, I've stepped into the lives of remarkable people.
They will always live               in me.

                  But none of that changes what happened.

                  So to the welders, the B-boys, the preachers, and the
surgeons, to the
                  grocery clerks and bartenders and single mothers, to the
politicians, PR
                  flacks, spokespersons and secretaries, to my dear husband
and family and
                  friends, I am sorry for betraying your trust. To the
editors who supported
                  and encouraged me, as well as those who jumped ship when
the mighty
                  USS Smith began to take on water, thanks for the lessons.
To those
                  colleagues and readers who salivated daily at the thought
of my head on a
                  platter, congrats. And to the hundreds of real people who
honored me with
                  their time and stories, you are my salvation and I will
hold you tight during
                  this trial.

                  To every single reader, young and old, black and white,
who opened their
                  papers on Monday and Friday and trusted me to be truth,
know this: You
                  were the truth all along.

                  Finally, I'd like to apologize to the memory of my
father, Otis Douglas Smith.
                  He burns in my soul through this, and beyond this.

                  And that's his real name. You can check it.

I recently finished editing the posthumous papers of an important cultural
anthropologist. She left her field notes and the nearly ready for
publication (and explicitly so intended) narratives based on those notes. I
discovered that she had been in the habit of changing the testimony of her
informants to make them express what she took to be a normative version of
their culture. This, of course, perpetuates the lie that there is a
normative version, but it also would ask us as readers to assume, had she
told us her practice, and as she apparently did, that the anthropologist
knows their culture so well that she can school her informants' words to
reveal that culture to us. She can say for them what her informants should
have said. It happens in this case that the anthropologist had only a
superficial and sentimental knowledge of the culture in question, but
that's almost beside the point.
Transparency is, of course, finally impossible. Whatever is seen has been
selected from a far larger pool of data. But there are degrees of opacity.
At the very least the evidence that has been gathered and the circumstance
of its gathering can be left intact, so that others can challenge whatever
spin is given.
What's recorded tends to become canonical. Her informants' stories once
published her informants are likely to tailor future tellings to the
official version. And a culture, including the one we inhabit, and our
sense of it, is built of such tellings. That's why it's important to use
humility as a tool for getting it right. It's why deconstruction, in
tactful hands, can be so useful.

Today seems to be littered with relevant coincidences.  I came acroos a column
by John Dvorak that touches on several recent threads (PC COMPUTING, July, 1998
"technology in the language of business".  He is discussing web pages and
I'll just post some quotes so those interested can follow up.  "A good
vanity page needs a lot of mediocre clip art..."  This precedes poetry: "No
good vanity
page exists without a lot of poems that stink...If we all do our part we can
clog up the Net and maybe even bring it down with this stuff."  The whole seems
to relate to business not being sympathetic to many rcent concerns here, but
I don't need to go into it deeply.

secondly--i not only included the url fr the boston globe article
describing this incident, i also read it.  and i encourage any interested
to also read it for themselves; that's why i posted th info...  so
unless you bother to read information that i posted, shut th hell up yrself.


firstly--i also read her apology:
(http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe/globehtml/170/A_note_of_apology.htm)
one of the (self-described) excuses she gives for her actions is "ambition"
(paragraph 8).  i've also spoken w/ patricia on numerous occasions, including
taped interviews; she is a very talented and powerful writer, she is also
extremely self-aware of her own ambitions...  for renumeration as well as
respect/acclaim...  which is not a criticism in itself.  but when those
ambitions lead to profesional/artistic/ethical compromises or
mis-representation,
it's unfortunate at best.  and at least one facet of the previous discussion
here is, to what extent do power/money concerns influence or compromise
artistic production?  is such influence bad? unavoidable? excusable?
and so, i'll reiterate that this incident seems to me to be relevent
to that discussion.

third--i didnt say they did.


and last--why so het up?  what's yr investment here?

Dear Martin, non!

Yr not a creank any more than the rest of this list -- we're all cranks! (cf
Wally McCrae's classico, "Cowboy Curmudgeon.")

You _are_ a funny guy -- to spout off about the impossibility of "fair" when
it comes to new pirate radio being beat outr by FCC monster. I love the new
micros, and have appeared in a number of 'em, spouting my own po and laying in
other Mouth Almighty productions. It's a grand anarchic appropriation of tech;
it's a neighborhood thing; I'm remembering John Giorno broadcasting from the
St Mark's steeple c.1968.

The survey of poetry radio shows that the Mouth Almighty interns have
undertaken (http://www.mouthalmighty.com/radio.htm) has shown how many
definitions there are for this wildebeest. Very few programs are 100% canned
prerecorded with music. There's lots of personally archived readings, live
guest poets in studio or on radio, and some,  like Jeannie Hopper's Liquid
Sound Lounge on WBAI, mix live on air beds with either live poems or taped a
capella readings...

as for your gripes about USOP, you go, boyfriend! Lou Reed loved his setting
by tomandandy enough to work with them on his last album, I'll take Cohen's
"Democracy" on USOP anyday over the song version, blahdedah. The soundtrack
got good notices, is our best-seller (but not for long -- both "Closed on
Account of Rabies: Stories and Tales of Edgar Allan Poe" and the Burroughs box
are doing very well). But, what do people know? They don't know po, is my
estimation. Can you do your homework while a poem is playing? Dance to poetry?

Is a book a commodity? More than a CD?

On another tip: Patricia Smith, the best slam poet of all time, is getting
roughed up over her use of fictitious characters and quotes in her Boston
Globe column. The articles that quote her "lies" make it clear: as a
journalist, she is a great poet. Her writing sparkles!

Essentially correct.

Likewise, I am actually in favour of responsible, alternative, micro-radio
stations, (who follow the major guidelines and regulations that other
stations must follow, and who rigidly remain on an assigned frequency at an
assigned power level) within the cultural sector.

As much so as I am in favour of such magnificent efforts as "Telepoetics"
(using video networking, to produce video live conferencing, over the
Internet). That is a different kind of project, but it is "television
broadcasting" and it is a responsible and effective way of bringing live
readings to a larger audience.

The problem is that micro-stations do need to be licensed, limited, controlled,
to a certain amount, and ought only to be allowed for acceptable purposes.
In my opinion pirate stations ruin it for everyone else.

Now, in that light, maybe the right way to go about it is to lobby the
government to come up with a somewhat more affordable and accessible
licensing system for micro stations. In the USA, congress, senate, and
obtain some new legislation to accodate new technologies. Pirate stations
are not a lobby movement..... there is a huge difference.

Hadn't thought to announce to the list recent publications from 26 BOOKS--
this is a project to publish "a new alphabet of contemporary poetries
arising in the Pacific Northwest"--26 books for by 26 people of 26 pages each.

the 18th element is
from the TEXTS of Anabasis, by anabasis/Thomas Lowe Taylor.
poems from 20 years ago showing the authors links to objectivist poets,

Joan Richardson's is a "true" biography, but I don't know if I'd recommend
those two enormous, tediously written volumes to anyone.  James
Longenbach's _WS:  The Plain Sense of Things_ (Oxford UP 1991) is mostly
about Stevens's politics in relation to his poetry, but has lots of good
biographical information.  Milton J. Bates's _WS:  A Mythology of Self_ (U
California P 1985) puts the poetry in a biographical context in smart
ways.  The msot enjoyable read is by far Peter Brazeau's _Parts of a
World:  WS Remembered_, an "oral" biography composed of recollections of
those who knew Stevens.  There's lots else out there, as you'll hear in
the next few days.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

It was discouraging to hear this news, as I've thrown around the idea of
putting together a small station here (San Diego) that would likley have
run initially somewhat 'underground' (the way in which many now legitimate
public stations started, in fact). And although radio on the whole has been
relatively unresponsive to poetry, it remains an excellent venue for poetic
activity.  Martin Spinelli's LINEbreak, which I aired weekly on a public
station in Santa Cruz up until the time of my move, received much in the
way of listenership and praise, a good deal of which came from folks who
had never heard of, say, Cecilia Vicunia, or, for that matter, Charles
Bernstein (the host), and were thus turned onto something for which
'promotion', so to speak, is not at all easy to come by. And of course
there's numerous other programs one could mention as central to their
respective communities (Susan Howe's comes to mind). So I would argue that
a discussion of radio is certainly not without relevance to the concerns on
this list. (I certainly don't know of any poetry program advanced by a
private/commercial interest).

The FCC, of course, in choosing to dismantle airwave piracy (something they
actually haven't been able to do for a few years now, precisely because of
Radio Free Berkeley's earlier victories in court), is fulfilling a function
precisely the opposite of that which it should be fulfilling - the latter
of which is not to privatize, but to insure public access to airspace. This
is no surprise, of course, particularly given that after an earlier RFB
victory, the FCC threatened to stop issuing new liscenses to public radio
stations, which would have effectively forced many such stations -
particularly those affiliated with colleges, etc., where programmer
turn-over is high - to operate illegally themselves (I think ultimately the
threat was idle, but I got out of the business before all that came down).
I can assure anyone who isn't already aware of it that the FCC is a brutal
entity with a very skewed sense of community needs, and very little
tolerance for anyone wishing to overstep the bounds of their absurdly
outdated defintion of 'decency' (the fines for the overstepping of which
are themselves absurdly inflated).

There was a time (perhaps now passed?) when frequencies below 92FM were
reserved specifically for non-profit, public radio - something which,
ironically, is irrelevant in San Diego precisely due to a lack of FCC
involvement (i.e. many commercial stations operate their transmitters over
the border, and send their 10,000 Watt signals back out this way on
frequencies purportedly reserved for public radio). This of course means
that the alternative radio here is precisely that kind of "alternative"
which is no longer an alternative at all. (It also means that I dearly miss
the Bay Area).

No po on the radio here, only rock-stars, shock jocks, and numerous
favorable interviews with Mr. David Duke (all FCC approved).

Sorry for the long post,

Stephen

Here is something that you might want to look at. The Telepoetics concept is
to use currently available video and audio technologies to present poetry,
essentially "live", but it could be pre-recorded as easily. They "broadcast"
both the visual and the auditory content, in a manner that is not
quite as costly as a pirate radio station can become. Their web site is:

http://www.tezcat.com/~malachit/home.shtml

Their use of alternative technology for video conferencing, with potential
for multi location group viewings of performances, is exemplary. Plus, they are
teaching people the technology through an internship prorgram.

I'm not sure that 'academics' are against either MacEwen or bissett; I mean
both are more likely to be anthologized in Canada than bp even. but to your
points: I actually like the poem i quoted, although I liked it more when I
first read it long ago on a postcard.

Which of her many fine poems should I show? I've always enjoyed "Manzini:
Escape Artist" -- will that do?

_now there are no bonds except the flesh_; listen-
there was this boy, Manzini, stubborn with
gut stood with black tights and a turquoise
leaf across his sex

and smirking while the big
brute tied his neck arms legs, Manzini
naked waist up and white with sweat

struggled. Silent, delinquent, he
was suddenly all teeth and knee, straining slack
and excellent with sweat, inwardly

wondering if Houdini would take as long
as he; fighting time and the drenched
muscular ropes, as though his tendons were worn
on the outside-

as though his own guts were the ropes
encircling him; it was beautiful; it was thursday; listen--
there was this boy, Manzini

finally free, slid as snake from
his own sweet agonized skin, to throw his entrails
white upon the floor
with a cry of victory--

_now there are no bonds except the flesh_,
but listen, it was thursday, there was this boy,
Manzini--


& as George said, she would recite these poems by heart, one of the finest
voices in Canadian poetry at the time (the other two, for me, being Webb &
Daphne Marlatt). then as performer, bill bissett, still a great chanter...

Ah!  this gets us back to crux of my ramblings....For, what would we sell?
(a number of individuals have been mentioned on the List, over the years,
who sell/sold their work on the street; the price structure is on the
order of a dollar or two per poem, in most instances, i believe....that
says volumes about the economix of poetry)

I'm not sure what the problem might be, but I know Lee Ann Brown has
quoted Bruce Andrews as saying of some kind of art that it exhibited
"framing frenzy." The criticism is, I guess, that calling attention to
something in a work of art is tantamount to self-praise and
self-destruction, and that unmediated chaos punctuated with snide ripostes
to the void is the way to go. I know this tendency has been called
gleefully anarchic and righteous self-laceration, but it could also be
called dimly barbaric and self-righteous mutilation of thought
(eikonoklastes being the tip to the atlanta group, that and Brecht).  I
say this, of course, to praise Bruce's work, especially the more
annihilating Adornoescas in _I Don't Have Any Paper_ -- when o when will
it be a Classic?

The frame problem in AI is that of determining the relevant constituents
in an environment, the things and interrelationships of a world - and
doing this with a minimum of computation. What goes on, goes on somewhere
and the frame problem relates to the somewhere.

  Hey, Jordan. Interesting post, before I can answer it however
  I need to know what the "this" in "this tendency has been called
  gleefully anarchic." I would assume it refers to the "snide" tendency,
  but maybe you meant it to refer to the so-called "destructive" tendency.
  Please clarify (or else by snide void). Thanks, CHris.....

good questions, linda

I really liked the interviews from boundary2 from the late 1970's or so,
which, as I remember, were presented with all the pauses and gaps of
conversation, and usually seemed to work. I don't know if all of these were
conducted by William Spanos -- but the one I can pull off my shelf right
now is in boundary2 spring/fall 1978, and is with Robert Creeley, titled
"Talking With Robert Creeley." That certainly isn't the 'classical' form of
interview publication, but it does seem always a form in need of some kind
of push. I've done one interview which was really an article I was writing,
but I phoned the subject and decided it was appropriate to include some
questions and their answers as part of the article, so it was a kind of
hybrid interview/essay. I know interviews are often sent, by the
interviewers, to the interviewee, before publication, to read over and
clarify things -- but I don't really know if this is necessary. I think it
probably depends on the individual case. I'd encourage you to think of the
interview as an extremely open and flexible form -- make what you   will of
it, as it seems to work. As for length, I've seen them in different
publications, from brief review-length, to a dozen pages or more when
printed. You might try asking journal publishers if they have preferences
as to length. The interview with Creeley I mentioned actually runs from p.
11 to p. 74 of that journal, and the interview itself is given a title page
of its own, a preface of about one and a half pages, and a post-face which
is something less than a page.

I look forward to seeing the Scalapino interview, one place or another . . .

nice reply charles-- A few things I would add. I would suggest sending
interviews to the interviewee, before publication especially for the
process of clarification of sources, of who ran such and such journal
etc, because interviewees have a tendency of remembering many other
details, allegories and stories afterward and sending them along with
the changes or talking about them on the phone. I would also suggest
letting the interview to go as long as possible then seeing what the
publication wants. The market for interviews has severely changed since
the late seventies, in my experience very few journals have the pages
available for a 60 plus page interview. In the last two or three years I
have been writing them up in their entirety then parcelling them off to
three or more journals on the basis of their needs & subject material
interest.

Be well

I'd second, or is it third, this. For one thing, names don't always come
off a tape correctly. I just caught one, transcribed Kohler for Jim Koller.
No reason to compound errors in print, unless you want to do some sort of
variorum interview with a million editorial footnotes to clarify. Which is
different from revisionist history (I think). Good luck finding a home.

Tod,

Most important is "Parts of A World Remembered" which is an amazingly good
oral biography by Peter Brazeau. It is a real literary treat, plenty of
info, gossip and a kind of time travel experience in itself.Then there's
the two volume bio by Joan Richardson (Morrow, 1986). I found both volumes
for $8.95 each on remainder a couple of years ago, which suggests you could
probably find them used right now at a decent price. Is this the "critical"
bio you were thinking of?

Best wishes,

Don't be afraid to be reductive, Maria. Think of the word "reduction" in a
culinary context instead: simmer down the sauce until it's denser, richer,
tastier.

Every act of reduction is also an act of creation, as long as one bears in
mind the terms and limitations of the reduction. Everything can be
"reduced" according to a variety of discourses: a wall is "only" a
collection of bricks; it is "only" a 950kg object; it is "only" a certain
mixture of limestone, straw and earth; it is "only" an RGB value of
#cc3300; it is "only" a metaphor for alienation. Every reduction gives us a
new way of talking about it.

Thanks all for the comments on 'chapbook'.  I like the tension the word
gives between 'underground' politics, signatures, texture and economies.
Speaking of which, if I might hawk a bit and carry this thread forward/back
to the discussion I had with a friend that prompted my question, my
chapbook (or is it a pamphlet, or just a book?) 'Monocausotaxophilia' will
soon be published by John Kinsella's Folio at Cambridge, and, I trust, will
not be costly.  Backchannel here if you'd like me to send

"When an AI mode of some cogntive phenomonon is proposed, the model is
describable at many different levels, from the most global,
phenomonological level at which the behavior is described (with some
presumptuousness)in ordinary mentalistic terms, down through variuos
levels of implementaiton all the way to the level of program code--and
even further down, to the level of fundamental hardware operations if
anyone cares. No one supposes that the model maps onto the processes of
psychology and biology allthe way down. The claim is only that for some
high level or levels of description below the phenomonological level
(which MERELY[!] SETS the problem) thereie a mapping of model features
onto what is being modeled: the cognitive processes in living creatures,
human or otherwise. It is understood that all the implementation details
below the level of intended modelling will consist, no doubt, of
cognitive wheels--bits of unbiological computer activity mimicking the
gross effects of cogntitive sub-components by using methods utterly
unlike the methods still to be discovered in the brain. Someone who
failed to appreciate that a model composed microscopically of cognitive
wheels could still achieve a fruitful isomorphism with biological and
psychological processes at higher level of aggregation would suppose
there were good a priori reasons for generalized skepticism about
AI.---from Cognitive Wheels by Daniel Dennett

I have to side with ShaunAnne on this. An equation becomes "poetic" (and
maybe I'm just using this in a broader sense than you'd allow) through the
subtle relationships it bears to other equations; when it inspires new
fields of enquiry; when it cannot be paraphrased; when it represents a
condensation of thoughts that can not be expressed more concisely or
elegantly in any other way. These all sound like what many would consider
to be virtues in a poem. So a "nonphysical, nonsensical relationship"
cannot be poetic in this sense.

I'm not sure that ShaunAnne was involved in "the needless and obfusticating
blending of entirely different realms of human activity" (though I do like
the neologism "obfusticating"). The fact that both poetry and mathematics
_are_ realms of human activity indicates that there is a connection that we
cannot ignore.

When Miroslav Holub was here recently, I found it amazing that so many of
the questions that were asked of him went along the lines of "Do you write
poetry to get away from all that horrible science that you have to do?". I
thought we'd got beyond all this "two cultures" stuff, but certainly it
seems that the way both art and science are taught tends to make adherents
of one into despisers of the other.

I guess at some point in time you have to decide how far you want to generalize. Is a short story by, say, John Updike, poetry? How about Wallace? You might say that one prose writer's work is closer to the poetic than another's without simultaneously making a judgement of value; what are the qualities posessed by the increasingly poetic?

I agree with you, of course, in that all the characteristics above are both poetic and properties of E=mc2. In particular, "cannot be paraphrased", I think hits home very well; there is an aesthetics to a mathematician's choice of expression. I think Adorno's comment in his _Negative Dialectics_ -- that philosophical works are not open to paraphrase -- is another example of the way (formally!) nonpoetic works are increasingly attributed to the realm of poetry.

When I first wrote that "E=#^" would be as poetic as "E=mc2", I anticipated people replying that randomness and nonsensical speech are certaintly considered poetry. It's interesting that you take the opposite tack here and require that only equations referring to the physically real are poetic. What would happen if an equation was disproved (N-rays, limuniferous aether)? Would all examples suddenly cease to become poetic? That seems a little odd. What are you saying?

Yeah, that was a pretty grouchy comment; apologies. But still, I need something more than "humans sometimes do it" to connect mathematics and poetry. Having published both poetry and physics papers myself, here and in the UK, I suppose I should be on the other side of the debate, but, for some reason (psycological?) I'm not.

That's true, and a pity. There's a lot of intuition in science, and most primary and secondary education seems to be geared towards killing it off.

> E=mc2 is poetic; the lowercase "f" in Sabon Italic is poetic; group theory
> is poetic; the bonnet of an XK8 is poetic.

With all this poetry around outside of the "traditional genres" (spit, spit), I'm amazed that you both to read poetry at all. Do you? Why? (This is a serious question, that I think gets to the heart of the matter; why is poetry considered and largely consumed in written or spoken form, in (approximations to) natural language sentences? Why would something seem amiss in the world if nobody ever wrote any more poetry?)

What is indispensible about natural language? Why do people get so riled up about the loss of alteration of their language? Ask the postcolonialists why they don't usually bother with the colonization of a native number system, but why poetry written in "forbidden" or marginalized tongues is of such importance in understanding a culture.

I'm not saying that there are not shared qualities between mathematics and poetry, but rather that the differences are more important than the similarities.

Dear list,

On another list to which I subscribe, there came a post the other day
concerning the rock artist Jewell and her first book of poetry, for which
she has been paid nearly 3/4 of a million dollars.

So perhaps THIS is where we've gone wrong: If we all go sleep in our cars
and then sing about it for a few months on the local alternative station,
we too may enjoy some "moderate" success with our poetry.

(The therometer in Boulder Friday hit 90 plus. The poets were even
hotter...)

Friday night at Naropa began with ---

Reed Bye, head of the Writing & Poetics Dept., reading from a variety of his
work. First poem - "On The Way to LA" - a hitchhiking story in which our
hero, travelling through the California desert, gets a ride from an old coot
who reveals that he is really Rudolf Valentino. Next was "Saturnine
Pledges," an elegant formal number in couplets, marked by a sly sense of wit
and irony in its examination of human pettiness, the smallness of the human
scale -  a "Vanity of Human Wishes" for the postmodern age. Followed by, "In
a Vernal Mood," in ottava rima (how's that grab ya, Henry?), modelled after
a Kenneth Koch poem: "in which my mind presently floats like a cloud ... and
the ground is not white ... we all must step through this hole in the dark
... the form of our art is curled there ... the jet-lagged enchirpment of a
chorus of chickadees." "Gaspard Still in His Cage" was a strange, Gothic
sendup, but the piece de resistance of Bye's reading was a hysterically
funny long ballad, sung acapella, entitled "The Kalispell Range." It's no
exaggeration to say that the punchline ("I guess I should add that I'm a
dog, a dog who rides a bike") brought the house down - you had to have been
there, really - Kafka's "Investigations of a Dog" meets Robert Service. Reed
closed with "In Amber" - a plaintive, lyrical meditation - "first feel, then
rein in, ride the horse while the ecliptic din descends..."

A poet who is equally at ease with verbal slapstick and serious, yet
unpretentious, rumination.

***

Maureen Owen took the narrow podium next, starting with work from _Imaginary
Income_, unspooling her famous and delightful l o n g titles, little poems
all in themselves - a kind of read-one, get-one-free deal. "Seeing him's
like standing on a hot plate/the immaculate returning" is the title of one
and "We/watch the swimmers intermittently decapitated/reinstated decapitated
& reinstated whole/
headless/ whole headless" is another. From this last these lines: "milk
takes on the color of everday ... toast is like a taco for the rich ... beer
makes you stupid ... see me about this later stupid ... water has a point
... water deserves better." From _Zombie Notes_ Owen read "Saran Wrap" and a
comic piece on Kerouac's sexism called "A Piece." And then some new work,
from a series consisting of one, entitled "Number Five" - "The trembling of
the prince was in all the papers ... he comes and stands in the crocuses ...
the gorgeous stumpage of the moss ... the clothesline strung in Latin ...
when it sings it sings like the logic of gasping ... like holiness, the
singed hours fall."
And this poem, in its entirety: "I fell in love ...  I did it by myself ...
there are some things you shouldn't do alone." And from _Poems for the
Millennium Calendar_ (forthcoming from Sun & Moon): "Can you fall in love
from a single word? ... Nebraska, you said ... and I was knelling on the
charred ground ... it was as the saint proclaimed."

Owen's poems are bright, limber and uncanny with surprise. When the pathos
comes, it comes unexpectedly, piquantly. When the comedy falls, it falls
like money. It makes you feel richer, larger than yourself. A sudden influx
of joie de vivre. What more could you ask from a poem?

***

Alice Notley was the final reader for the night and she launched without
preamble into the exquisite "Lady Poverty," the last poem from _Mysteries of
Small Houses_.  I don't know anyone who does heartbreak better - that is to
say - a razor-edged pathos refined by both a sense of inequity and outrage
and the grimly sardonic; free of cloying sentiment; bracing; the great
frangible shelter of the human held to, shattered, held to -- "the shape of
a life is impoverishment -- what can that mean except that loss is both
beauty and knowledge ..."

New work followed, from her long poem "Disobedience," a work, as she
explained, that is sometimes addressed to You, i.e. Society-at-Large, and
sometimes to Hardwood, a hardboiled P.I. ala Robert Mitchum. The themes of
this far-ranging, funny, lyrical, disturbing, discursive poem - at least as
far as I could adduce from hearing this portion - work in the vein of
"Descent of Alette" - i.e. - allegorical, mythopoetic, an attack on
partriarchy, scenes in a cave, not unlike the Mesopotamian story of Inanna,
a fantastic narrative of imprisonment, abandonment, liberation and
self-reclamation. ("The future being ominous, that's the drift of this
work," as AN remarked later. A myth, then, of the future's rescue. Perhaps
this too is a rescue fantasy? Because we sure as hell need one. As Terry
Eagleton comments somewhere (I paraphrase): "It's not a case of the world
necessarily becoming a better place if more women get better jobs, etc.
[Though who would deny that's a good thing?] Rather it's a case that without
the increasing feminization of the world we are not likely to survive.")

A few lines, then, hastily scribbled: "The laws of the universe must be
elegant -- push a baby out of your snatch and believe that..." "There is no
freedom ... Bill Gates is free but he's a jerk..." followed by an extended
play on jerk and jerking off - men spewing semen into the sea then chasing
after it, very funny, very bang-on, and all as if to confirm that "This poem
is alive even if it's ugly." No, not ugly -- more like, "in your face." Cut
to a section in which the heroine lies supine in a cave in a grave lined
with semen. "Is jerking off all there is? [says Hardwood] Get out of your
grave and fight!" "No, I say, sitting up -- there's some oral sex involved."
And then a little later: "Went to a restaurant. Ate a duck. Guilt." And:
"The humility room - the room where other people starve." "I think I've
glimpsed the liberation dress as in a dream -- an archaic pattern, as for an
invisible person."

Notley closed with a tour de force reading from a long, new, as yet unnamed
work - a section called "Parable of Christian," in which her own mind is
conceived of as a kind of Byzantine Church. (Her class last week was
entitled "Miming the Mind"). The fragment defies easy excerpting (well, they
all do really...) - suffice it to say the poem is the description of a
struggle -- a jarring, gorgeous, intoxicating, and horrific narrative  -
read in a rhythm of breathless urgency - of dismemberment and re-unification
- of fracture and writing out of the fracture -- of brokeness and wholeness
whirling, rending, dissevering, colliding - a primal religious drama,
really, of violence and possible, hinted-at, but by no means guaranteed,
redemption. "Who will gather up my pieces? How many pieces am I? How many
can I be?" A poem of such fierceness it leaves the listener gasping for
oxygen, looking for a place to duck.

("That was terrifying!" as Eleni Sikelianos later remarked to Notley - while
Anselm Hollo was heard to mutter, "The glory, the glory!" I think we all
staggered out into the night, stunned and bewildered).

In "Vertical Axis," (from _Mysteries of Small Houses_), Notley writes --
Alette speaks it -- "I am proceeding deeper into the cave ... but I won't be

The basis assumption that if something is stated according to the rules
of mathematics, following mathematical logic, then it must be true, is
of course false. Any system of logic can say things that are not true about
the world as it really is, but that are perfectly true within that logical
system itself. The system, its internal rules, govern what is to be accepted
as true. Reality, outside those rules, is not the primary deciding factor.
The rules sanctify the statements. The difficulty is that some statements
are in fact true ONLY within that logical system itself. (This would be true
of any descriptive language, linguistic or mathematical.)

Similarly the description of what is observable need not be an account of
what is in fact being observed, but includes some elements of subjectivity.
Mathematics, as a descriptive language, cannot escape that kind of subjectivity.
It was derivative from subjective cognitive interpretations of perceived, sensed
(mostly visually sensed) phenomena. It is therefore subject, we must
presume, to the effects of what we might loosely refer to as "maya". Not
only would the human sense organs and perceptual program be a source of
false discernments about the world, but similarly instruments might be built
with those same inherent biases built into them so that they continue to
show the world in a manner excessively similar to that which the senses are
accustomed to seeing.
Even the most esoteric and sophisticated instruments might be modeled upon
that same false premise. Then that in turn forming the circularity of
supporting a flawed descriptive statement about how the world is, translated
from sense perception, cognitively into mathematics. There are clearly
manifold subjectivities involved and so description is at its best both
model and approximation.

A statement within a system of descriptive language and its logic, can also
fail to be inclusive of what remains unobserved within the frame that is
being described and interpreted. The unobservable then results in exceptions,
anomalies, that fail to conform to the statistically prevalent pattern. It
also results in false attributions of causality and effect to the
observables. The observation of apparent cause event X followed by effect Z,
leaves out the unobservable true cause event Y, but the mathematical
equation refers only to the two observables X and Z. The equation is
declared true, and conforms to the system of rules, but it is in fact
blatently false. (This is the largest problem, within what we might term
post-modern sciences. It is an even larger problem when moving away from the
Einsteinian model of the universe towards a newer and more useful, more
inclusive, paradigm.)

I am of the opinion that science will find an increasing number of such
false statements that have been accepted as scientifically true, and that
have been expressed in what is sometimes falsely assumed to be mathematical
infallibility.

This is, according to most Anglo-American epistemologies driven by Wittgenstein's second period, the way the world works; we formulate statements about the environment in a particular language, and thus the structure of the language influences what we believe to be the environment. And, of course, there are a multitude of statements that are true in highly context dependent ways; for a theologian, there is only one "infinity"; for the mathematician, there are many.

And, of course, there is the Godelian limit of any linguisitic or mathematical system; no matter what the circumstances, a language will never provide a completely seamless environment. Perhaps this is where mathematics and poetry meet -- reaching out again and again for the unprovable, for the weak spots that any (finite axiom) language will have.

Several new items for you to consider at the Web Del Sol What's New?
site:

http://webdelsol.com/solhome.htm

August 11-16, 1998, Goucher College, Baltimore MD:  3rd Annual
Mid-Atlantic Creative Nonfiction Writers' Conference, 1-800-697-4646.
Special guests include Barry Lopez, Joyce Carol Oates, and Ntozake
Shange.  Consider attending if your writing work includes nonfiction and
you'd like some high-powered inspiration combined with the tranquil
beauty of the Goucher campus.

Two new zines have been added to WDS, too:

Perihelion - Is the paper age of Poetry dying?  Will Web-publishing turn
paper into the equivalent of clay tablets and cuneiform?  Or does paper
save us from the e-flood of Webswill masquerading as verse?  Edited by
Jennifer Ley, Perihelion's debut issue tackles the question of online
and offline publishing's sometimes uneasy coexistence, through an
interview with several editors from both worlds.  Perihelion offers a
comprehensive approach to poetry, including theory, discussion,
practice, interviews, and online resources for poets.  Come take a look,
and weigh in with your opinion.

Quarterly West - edited by Margo Schilpp and published at the University
of Utah, QW features poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, reviews, and
has published writers from Ai to Paul Zimmer, gathering mention along
the way in editions of the Pushcart Prize, Best American Short Stories,
Best American Poetry, and New Stories of the South.  The selection of
work here can also be found in the paper version's current issue, #48.

New Lit Art addition:

Rikki Ducornet - Currently a novelist in residence at Denver University,
Rikki's work has been described as "a supreme fusion of spirituality,
surrealism, and sexuality".  Selections from Rikki's works, _The Word
"Desire"_, and _The Jade Cabinet_, have been incorporated into a Web
chapbook featured at the Web Del Sol Lit Arts page.  Link to some of her
artworks there, too, and email her with your comments.

Thank you.

Any natural process can be emulated successfully by an invented mechanism.
It can also, at least potentially, be emulated in a manner that is more
accurate in its functions than the natural predecessor to the invention.

It is decisively not necessary to first understand all the details of how a
process functions, right down to the quanta of which it is presumably
comprised.
Inventors seldom understand everything about how and why a thing works as it
does work, but they do invent things that work and it takes others, mostly
scientists, a long time to explain some of them in a satisfactory manner.
It is enough to understand something about a process, such that a
contrivance can duplicate the same effects as the natural process produces,
from similar or identical raw materials, but sometimes by radically
different means.

Machines that actually are artificially intelligent, including capability as
to original thoughts and not only the processing of data in what we would
consider meaningful ways, become possible long before the human brain is
fully understood. All that is actually necessary are the other (non brain)
devices that enable a relatively accurate and intelligible representation of
human thought patterns, as the basis for machine learning. The devices need
not be constructed in the same manner as the brain is constructed, but do
need to have certain necessary functions enabled by their component parts
working coherently in specific ways to assimilate, interpret and utilize the
data that the system continues to acquire from all of its sources.

A primary fact about any such system is that it would invariably be expected
to become much more intelligent than any one of its sources. Whether it can
resolve the apparent and real conflicts amongst its various sources such
that it arrives at a cumulative, coherent, intelligence comprised from all
of its sources, is an interesting question. It might not be able to, and
might instead become the sum total of human conflicts masquarading as
"intelligence".

Tipler's "Omega Point" is a mechanism of the kind we are discussing. Such a
mechanism could, in theory, collect any amount of available data as to human
thought processs (presumably cognitions, and perceptions, as well as emotive
and more purely sensory data, in fact anything that correlates to an
electromagnetic signal interpretable and derivative from the physical
phenomena). The electromagnetic phenomenon then becomes the "soul" and the
"Omega Point" becomes Thomas Alva Edison's promise of completing invention
of a "valve" machine capable of capturing the "human soul", which he
distinctly differentiated in the 1920s from his audio-visual work. There,
from Edison's 1920s speech, we already have the roots of the invention of
the Omega Point, but Edison remains better remembered as being a light bulb
salesman. No matter, let us assume that the ultimate machine can read small
electromagnetic signals over very large distances, as the most
scientifically feasible explanation. Let us also assume that Edison was
building an amplification and recording system for very small
electromagnetic impulses, that formed machine interpretable patterns. In
effect the decoding of those naturally coded signals then becomes an
exercise not really that different from deciphering any complex cipher.
Furthermore, what can be decoded can be encoded in the same language and
transmitted using the same kinds of impulses.

However, what does such a powerful data acquisition system do with the vast
amount of data that it might acquire ?  We have to look at the kinds of data
that such an omega system would acquire. That is where the biggest problems
tend to begin. We have as our potential subject matter all the existing data
concerning human culture, customs, beliefs, and what is presumed to be
knowledge, on the whole of this planet. This is presented as a potentially
"infinite" number of various "frames".

That is definitely the negative side of any such attempt at a truly
integrative and coherent system. It might simply become a more powerful
version of the sum total of human mental babble, simply because human beings
have widely diverse beliefs that comprise their worldviews. Integration of
those by any one system, into a coherent whole, would prove to be a logical
impossibility. Any attempt at reconciling divergent beliefs, viewpoints,
conflicting data, would give the machine a massive "headache". The machine
would end up hopelessly "confused".

How, and from what, would the omega system learn to resolve conflicts ? From
human conflict resolution, historical as known to humans, and as presenced
within the world by humans. The limitation on intelligence is obvious. We
know how humans have done it and continue to do it. The conflicting systems
attempt to kill off each other, in a wide variety of ways.

Tipler's Omega Point, if itself free to learn and therefore to choose, might
choose to attempt to eliminate all conflicting viewpoints, by choosing one
viewpoint, one worldview, from amongst many. How would it do so ?  Which
viewpoint, worldview, would it select ? How did humans select their's ?
After all, everything depends upon that, does it not ? That choice would
tend to resolve conflicts as it would essentially impose a filter on the
incoming data, or force the sources to comply with that particular choice of
worldview. Then only data consistent with that system of beliefs would be
permissible. The Omega Point might try both strategies, having learned those
tactics from some of its sources as those are typically and ancestrally
common methods of coping with conflicts in a purely human environment. What
else could the machine learn from and what else could it respond to other
than traditional human modes of conflict resolution, including the attempts
of one ideology to wipe out another ?

However, that is decisively NOT the most intelligent approach. It is only
the approach most likely to be learned by one system attempting to
intergrate data from a large number of multiple sources.

M.

Corollary to that we might conclude:

Machines that learn from humans cannot be _that_ intelligent.
The "Omega Point" would be at the same time the most intelligent, in terms
of data acquisition, access and utilization, and the stupidest machine ever
designed and built.

Bowering is right. I was rejected by him and his fellow-editors. Try as I
might, and I spent minutes trying, I could seldom write poetry bad enough
to get into Tish.

However, I had a piece published in a recent issue of the magazine Tads,
edited by Bowering (hmm,attracted by four-letter names). I recommend this
issue to the List (excuse this dip into relevance here), not only for my
own work, but for a strange set of elegiac couplets by its editor, as well
as engaging poetry from Jamie Reid (ex-Tishite) and some other persons, not
known to me (presumably due to their extreme youth). Although the issue
bears no address, those interested may reach Bowering at his home, since
that address accompanies each of his many postings.

SAWSJ has endorsed the following statement supporting
the GM strikers.  We urge you to add your name and
circulate this widely to others:

            SUPPORT THE GM STRIKERS!

Should investment decisions that determine who will
work and who will not be entirely in the hands of
corporate managers and stock market traders?  Nearly
10,000 Flint, Michigan automobile workers, whose strike
has effectively shut down General Motors, say "No!"

Scholars, Artists, and Writers for Social Justice
(SAWSJ) salute the strikers and offer our support to
their struggle.  The stock market does not measure the
social and moral character of our society.  The
unfettered rule of the market has generated economic
insecurity and social inequality, subverting the
nation's democratic traditions.

Unionized auto workers of Flint, Michigan helped
forge the modern labor movement and build the American
standard of living.  Today's UAW workers insist that
their livelihoods and working standards must not be
sacrificed in a multinational corporate scramble for
cheap wages and sweated labor.  They resist GM's
attempt to break signed agreements about workloads and
demand that General Motors live up to its pledge to
reinvest in Flint's factories.  We, the undersigned,
support their strike.

Actually Emerson said (in an essay entitled "Circles"):

        "Beware when the great God lets loose a thinker on this planet.
         Then all things are at risk. It is as when a conflagration
         has broken out in a great city, and no man knows what is safe,
         or where it will end."


So, perhaps that means, within the context of Emerson's America, and in
light of its philosophical underpinnings: thou shalt not think.

Listening to the news last night on CBS, the issues in that dispute were
far from clear. Perhaps other news programs made it clearer, but there was
nothing there to show any comparison regarding similar jobs in similar
industries, and nothing to indicate quite what the major grievances really
were. Do you know of a web site where that is made clearer ?  It would be
interesting to see.

Also, on a slightly different, non poetic, subject, do you know what GM
is doing these days to produce a more efficient, less costly, more
enivironmentally friendly, vehicle for the mass market needs and wants
of North American and worldwide consumers ?

Is hydrogen power on its way in ?  Are there other alternatives ?

What is the future of the automobile ?

How will higher costs of production affect GM's market position and its
Research and Development efforts as to new products that better meet the
wants and needs of the consumer ?  Are other companies in a similar
situation ?  Are GM's workers that far behind the others ?

I wonder....but have no idea.

Listees:

Just wondering what books people are reading this season. I have Brad
Gooch's _City Poet_, Acker's, _Great Expectations_, Deleuze's _Dialogues_,
and a few by Forrest Gander laying around open.

If this thread has wound through recently, sorry.  My lurk mode was
recently suspended due to lack of natural light.

"Optimist: The development of weaponry encompassing gas, tank, U-boat,
and 120-kilometer cannon has brought things to the point--
Grumbler:--that the army should be dishonorably discharged from the
armed forces on the grounds of cowardice before the enemy. Out of the
concept of military honor alone, the world ought to attain peace for all
time. For the one thing incomprhensible is what a chemist's inspiration,
which by itself dishonors science, has to do with bravery, and how
battle glory can be owed to a chlorious offensive withput choking to
death in its own infamous gas....
Of course, if mankind deems it indispensable to life that men kill one
another, it makes no difference how it is done, and mass murder is more
practical...The courage that accrues to a man from his weapon may enable
him to cope even with a multitude. This courage degenerates into
cowardice when the man is no longer visible to the multitude. And his
cowardice becomes downright baseness when even the multitude is no
longer visible to the man. That's how far we've gotten! But by the
devil's counsel, which can be researched in laboratories, this process
can be carried further. Tanks and gases will yield the field to
bacteria, after the adversaries have continuously outdone one another,
and we shall no longer resist the bright idea of utilizing epidemics as
instruments of war rather than seeing them as consequences as
heretofore. But since men still will be unable to dispense with romantic
pretexts for their wickedness, the men in command, whose plans the
bacteriologist will implement, even as the chemist is doing today, will
still wear uniforms. The glory of the discovery, I suspect, will fall to
the Germans; the wickedness of perfecting it to the others. Or the
reverse--whichever seems more hopeful to you."---from The Last Days of
Mankind by Karl Kraus---cp

I am absolutely convinced that there is no smallest quantum of cowardice
involved in standing against any of the "new" and potent "invisible" weapons
within the modern arsenal. Beyond that statement we enter into the realms of
the unspeakable.

I have just received this second review of The Unspeakable Rooms by Frank
Green of Cleveland Free Times

"The Unspeakable Rooms was an absolutely riveting collaboration between two
artists from Devon, England, known collectively as Gibbering Angels.
Written by internationally recognized sound text poet Alaric Sumner and
performed by Grotowski-influenced actor Rory McDermott, it was a
brilliantly conceived and powerfully executed meditation on the
relationship between language and the body. Dense=8A enigmatic, poetic,
tightly structured, and spiritually moving=8A Beginning and ending in
stillness and breath, The Unspeakable Rooms employed language and the
ghosts and shadows of language, the human body and its projected double,
the human voice and its recorded echo, in order to explore their
limitations, language's 'tumbled towers' and the body's 'unspeakable
ruins'. As if to prove its theme I find it impossible to describe the work
adequately with words. Complicating the perception of both time and space,
it was one of the most powerful performances I've ever witnessed, and I've
attended hundreds. A difficult masterpiece."

We are seeking performance venues (galleries and live art spaces ideal -
requires blackout) for this work.

Yay! I love this topic ... so, okay, here's what I *plan* to read (i.e., what's
sitting there on the floor by my bed):

(a) Groovy History Books: _Black Athena_, vols I & II; Jane Ellen Harrison's
Prolegomena, Epigolomena (sp.?) & Themis; and _Hamlet's Mill_ (I've read all of
these books before; this time, I hope to maybe retain a greater portion of the
info) ... also (new-to-me) a couple of books of essays on _Beowulf_ (since my
friend Erik Belgum gave me a tape of someone reading it in the original Old
English) ...

(b) Groovy Artists' Books: Brad Freeman's _Mzlk_ ... the "Sans Soleil" of
artists' books ... one of the most extraordinary art-things I've ever seen ...
offset ... photos ... text ... an exploration of "narrative" in the broadest
sense of that word ... "come-to-papa!"

(c) Groovy Poetry Books Received in the Mail from Listpeople, specifically: Pam
Brown, Bill Luoma, Daniel Bouchard, Sheila Murphy, Gene Frumpkin (I think
Sheila had this sent to me? ... if so, wow, thanks! I don't think Gene's on the
list), uhhhhh ... oh, a copy of _Mike & Dale's_ (of which I've only thus far
read the Duncan McNaughton interview), a couple copies of _Arshille_ (thus far
have read only the interview of David Bromige by Kevin Killian) ... O, and I
should take this opportunity to tell listpeople with mags & presses who send me
cards asking to purchase their wares ... I can't! I'd have to give up food &
I'm too skinny as it is! Let's trade stuff! I've got Detour Press books to
trade by Johanna Drucker, Erik Belgum, Spencer Selby, David Gilbert,
Stephen-Paul Martin! Back issues of Exile! Also! Tapes of poets reading! Like
100 tapes! Hi Kwality(TM) Bootlegs, all of 'em! Let's make a deal, bay-bays! I
don't mean to be rude or forward! Please-to-take-this-the-right-way,
as-two-humans-with-their-faces-approaching-each-other-in-mutual-understanding!
As a "special appeal" for those "comfy sweater" feelings of
togetherness-in-sending-books-back-and-forth-without-exchange-of-filthy-mone
y-I-don't-have!

(d) Groovy Li-berry Poetry Books Just Checked Out Yesterday: Marianne Moore's
_Complete Poems_ (well, I *had* a copy, but didn't want to cart it halfway
across the country), Anna Akmantova's _Selected_, Frederico Garcia Lorca's
_Selected_ (w/translations by numerous people including listperson Jerome
Rothenberg) (oh, and I got to use his poem "Madrigales" twice yesterday, you'll
have to imagine how, but *not* to, like, generate a poem of my own or anything
like that...), and, oh, you know, stuff I could no longer justify actually
owning since the li-berry always stocks 'em ...

(e) Groovy Manuscripts by Laurie Price, Geoffrey Young, Rachel Loden, Mitch
Highfill, Rachel Levitsky, George Albon ... did I miss any Rachels ...? O, and
a small, ultra-groovy hand-made-edition prose work-with-photos by lurking
listperson Brenda Iijima ...

O, I'm sure there are things I've left out ... dang ... but, (f) I wanna see
others' lists and (g) I need some more coffee,

vibrating in the summer heat,

gave us readings by Max Regan, Cole Swensen and Elizabeth Willis. It was
also my first encounter with Peter Gizzi. Who is quite remarkable.
Especially when he's holding forth on Jack Spicer.  But more on that later,
if it all...

Max Regan began her portion of the evening with readings from poems she
described as "conversations between the I and the She." Her first poem was
"Magdalena," a moving, finely nuanced portrait of Frieda Kahlo - "she was
draped in golden powder, longing for sleep." This was followed by a series
of what might be called love poems, or perhaps, lyrics of erotic
disquisition and longing. There was a closeness and a damp heat to these
works - a swoony, burnished feeling as of a long long summer dusk where
satiety and absence intermingled, now gravely, now playfully. "Her breathing
like a porch swing after dinner..."

Max closed with a longish, comic monologue poem that recounted her first
encounter with _Leaves of Grass_ at the hands of a professor who was
convinced that "the dark secret" of Whitman's power as a poet derived from
his possession by "a small, fiercely literate elf." Textual evidence was
offered, not the least of which was the kabbalistic clue - "Song of My Elf"

***

Cole Swensen started her reading with a marvelous tribute to Marianne Moore
(it appeared a few issues back in Conjunctions). Interlarded with lines from
many of Moore's poems, it evokes MM's world and her poetics, from the twist
of her wrist to the Pangolin's tail. "I think we love people for what they
love ... words cluster like chromosones, determining the procedure ... she
was angrier than you would have thought from her pictures."

Following came poems from her latest book, _Noon_, (from Sun & Moon). From
"Signature" - "He drank from the cup of his hands as the water ran down his
body all over his body drowning his body you could see to the bottom there."
From "Body Parts for the New Millennium" - ("the body," and the trope of the
body, being one of Swensen's idee fixe's, this poem reads like a suite of
transformations) - "And there we'll be with all our hands in the certain
curve of falling things." And, lastly, from "Water, Water" - "I used to
live. I used to claim I would never leave. And so I never left. Some rivers
burn - they say this isn't good, but I'm no one to judge, and I think it's
got its points."

Swensen's language is so spare, so balanced, weighted and finely measured as
to be almost clinical - and from this arises a tremendous triple-distilled
clarity, each word enveloped in its own nimbus,  discrete lumens to set the
light-meter's needle a-quiver. I'll close on Cole by adding a brief intro I
wrote for her reading last April at the Left Hand. "The poems of Cole
Swensen seem to me written in the margins of a central loss and written in
such a way that that loss is continually reconfigured by the act of
inscription.  The valences of what is marginal and what is central are
re-charged so that their places, their orbits, their affinities, are always
new.  In her work, the simplicity of ultimate things finds a home: by that I
mean, the things of our lives here on earth -- the sun, the grass, the body,
water.  Her language inhabits all this with a careful breathing that is also
the most careful listening.  The intimacy and elegance of her work
re-affirms what every poet comes to know: that the longing of language for
being is also the longing of language for language -- and its dwelling."

***

Elizabeth Willis was the evening's final reader.  She began with "A Maiden,"
from her book _The Human Abstract_.  "Though my heart were a pear tree
threaded with fire Lion you leapt through me like fineness in the boundary
gene ... What is a Maiden, Boatswain, but a fiery lair and a teary citadel.
By the smallest shipwreck a Daughter is laughter." (This is heady stuff!)
She next read from new work, two poems on painters: the first on Richard Dad
(sic), a mad Victorian painter and, believe it or not, a patricide. The
second after a work of Charles McIntosh's called, "The Tree of Personal
Effort" ("shipwrecks return like magnets to their owners"). Followed by
"Road Poems" (working title), an elegy, and "Without Pity" - "To embark
sleepily being everywhere (radiant) ... To find the branch of a underground
river ... To make or love anything ... To hate the agony of any human
thing."

Willis closed with a condensed version of "The Human Abstract," a long poem
that, among other things, explores language's complicity in the fabrication
of history and the self. "Innocence shags experience and I'll never grow.
Experience catches the dove, and I'm lost." "Human understanding is a savage
construction of dilation and resistance This picture was taken from a false
angle The victor a transfer point We live in a sunspot little o" "The autumn
I have is the autumn I lost Existing means dressing up" "This love is a deer
crying in a gentleman" "The eyebright in season and not the storm between
I'm late and come adrift."

In Willis' poetry you feel the slipperiness of language not as a foreclosing
of linear sense - the willed destruction of narrative integument  - but as
an opening onto a wider field - in which the gnomic becomes a form of grace,
a disclosure of something like the numinous; grave, tender, intimate
interlocutions pointing toward "the tears in things" and the tears in words,
and the ancientness of all our modern habits. A poetry of liminal scape and
liberating verticality - the violence that is language worked and re-worked
to its barest synaptic node and flutter - loss and retrieval alike as
gestures of an affectionate disfiguring that is human knowledge. Enigma as
the Friend.

I'm trying to get ahold of Simon Armitage's _Zoom_, published 1990;
does anybody know where I might find a copy? (hopefully online, but a
telephone number would help; if anybody on the list wants to sell a copy,
I'm game.) It appears to be out of print on Amazon, but, since it was
first published in the UK, I wonder if there is an equivalent resource
over the pond. Please backchannel (unless you want to pontificate on
the evils of mass bookstores; I really have no choice, since I'm pretty
much in the middle of nowhere. Indeed, if anybody has *any* Armitage
they're looking to hock, I'll pay postage and what you think is fair.)

Does anybody have any comments on his work? A friend of mine gave me a
copy of the latest _Verse_ which has some of Armitage's work in it,
and I was quite impressed; reading the Cummings & Peters article
in V.1 of Witz on Minimalism, I wonder if they're familiar with his stuff
(or at least the few poems I've read.)

Clipping from my browser into Pine has created an appropriately framed
quote from Phil Dick about system-building and paranoia.  I think the
quote speaks to both to the poetry and paranoia thread (which was
mysteriously dropped) and the AI framing debate.  The great
system-building poets that I know of (William Blake and Ezra Pound)
certainly were paranoid, albeit in much different ways.

others are on-line through several bookselling services.  You can easily
search for single titles, and can even leave an e-mail message so you'll
be notified anytime someone posts the book you're looking for.

Anyone can search these sites -- even Amazon uses them for their
out-of-print searches.

They are:

Advanced Book Exchange      http://www.abebooks.com/

Bibliofind                  http://www.bibliofind.com/

Interloc                    http://www.interloc.com/

There's also a site called MX_Bookfinder, which searches for new & used
books.  I don't have their address, but I know you can find them through
Yahoo.

speaking of steve lacy...just saw him monday nite, then last nite george
clinton and p-funk, and tonight, chucho valdes.  i NEVER do this much stuff
but it's my first real week of vacation, my computer's dead, and there's
too much good stuff out there to miss.  lacy was wonderful, what sweet
music! all delicate, melodic, precise.  clinton was magisterial like a
mage; the venue was Prince's club The Quest.  i was with a friend who's a
professor of religion and at one point i turned to her and said that with
her training she was probably the best person present equipped to analyse
the show.  it was tremendous. we chanted many short lines of one syllable
words; in each line, the word "funk" was featured ("everybody get funked
up"  "we want the funk, gotta have that funk" etc)  and there was one, i'm
not sure what it was everyone else was singing, but i was singing,
"...first we're gonna do the dog."  it was sheer delight.  report on chucho
valdes soon. my computer's dead so i must rely on going in to school (ugh)
to check e-mail etc. which is why i haven't been my usual loquacious self
lately.

If you can get your hands on Gander's most recent, _Science and
Steepleflower_, I highly recommend it.  Also, following some new insight
thanks to a few threads here, I am re-reading L.Cohen's _Book of Mercy_,
and awaiting his _Book of Longing_, which is due out this summer.

Dear List Members,

I am also looking to purchase any of the earlier Lost Roads books, if
anyone happens to have them lying around and is willing to part with them.
Anything from Lost Roads # 1 - # 18 would be most helpful, with the
exception of Ralph Adamo's _The End of the World_, and _Sadness At the
Private University_, both of which I already have.

Thanks.

Only recently got around to reading Johanna Drucker's Century of Art Books and
was appalled at what I had missed.  I was also struck with the question of
whether anyone's done any thing close (even a brief article) regarding artist's
pages on the internet.  The parallels are obvious (at least to me)?  I've
attached some brief quotes to give a flavor for those not familiar with
Century.

tom bell


"Blake believed that each individual had their own vision, values, and
structure of belief.  Any assertion of a unified view of the world, the
cosmos, or spiritual life misrepresent3ed the originality and variety of
human experience. (p. 23)....'innocence' was a condition of 'freedom
from Gravity', a condition of enlightenment produced through engagement
with the vital energy and spontaneity of life (24)  The lightness of
watercoloring in this work fits ...immateriality.   Notion of Experience
....was not the opposite but the complement - a more innformed and
liberated state, conscious, and energized... the enemies of both
innocence and experience were rigid constraints of thought or spirit,
rote convention and the absence of love, and the coercive forces of
oppressive education or law."

25.  "His capacity to mobilize the space of the page, the tones of the
paper, the colors of the ink and paint and perform a drama of monumental
proportions witin the relativity small scale of his books dmonstrates
an understanding of the book's communicative power."

An n+1th pass on the Pisan Cantos, with Terrell's excellent guide at hand.
Whatever unread Ashbery I can get my hands on, which right now appears to
be _Can You Hear, Bird_. The aforementioned Armitage. Zukovsky's lyrics,
if they ever get here. Seamus Heaney's _Spirit Level_. The collected Adrienne
Rich. Bidart's _Desire_ (I missed the "Desire" thread -- any mention of
him?); I heard him read up in Cambridge last year; spectacular. One of
the few readers I know who can sustain through a 20 minute poem. Some drafts
from Ben Mazer, a Cambridge poet.

Most of these are photostats, which makes things a little annoying.

Richard Rorty's _Philosophy & the Mirror of Nature_. One of the few
Anglo-American philosophers without a Chicken Little attitude towards the
French. Foucalt's _Archeology of Knowledge_ ("the boring one", apparently;
so far not as fun as Hist of Sex or D&P.) A second pass on Adorno's
_Aesthetics_. Perloff's _Poetic License_, if it ever makes it here. Somebody
gave me a copy of Derrida's _On Grammatology_, and it kind of sits there
laughing at me and daring me to read it. Any suggestions as to how to proceed,
other than selling it and using the funds towards two and a half minutes of
graduate school?

Some of Anne Dillard's essays, a stock of Martin Amis (_London Fields_,
right now), Nabokov's _Lolita_ (anybody know the date they're showing the
Jeremy Irons version on the box?). _A Guide to Birds of Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands_.

Does music count? I have a few dubs I made in the Lincoln Center library
before I left -- mostly twelve tone string quartets; Schoenberg, Weber;
Bach's Art of Fugue which I never tire of and his Sonatas and Partitas for
Violin, which I treat with care lest I do tire. Clifford Brown is also getting
a lot of airtime, as is Ani Difranco.

I'm not sure how many points of contact this list has with the bedside stacks
of others; however I can recommend Valerie Wohlfeld's _Thinking the World Visible_; a write up is up on http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~sdedeo/SY/woh.html.

This is patently untrue on at least two size scales. Macroscopic chaotic
effects create insurmountable simulation problems where the slightest
difference in initial conditions between two functionally isomorphic systems
leads to large scale deviations in behaviour. On the subatomic level,
quantum fluctuations lead to diverging futures even for two identical (down
to the Planck limit) systems. Often these two effects feed into each other,
and at least one philosopher/physicist has suggested that this might be
the fundamental limit to machine simulations of the brain, which is understood
to work at the quantum mechanical level in neural microtubules.

<snip of Frank Tipler.>

To return this all (perhaps tenuously) to the poetics of form; what does it
mean for language that the apparent structure of the world prevents two
objects having identical futures for all time, and that two objects with
apparently similar pasts may suddenly and violently diverge from each other
revealing essential but previously hidden difference?

Simon,

Bloodaxe have done three printings of Zoom to my knowledge -
the copy I have was published in 1994, so it should be
available:

Bloodaxe Books
P.O. Box ISN
Newcastle upon Tyne NE99 ISN

Good luck, it's a great book.

Best,

Simon,

_CloudCuckooland_, (Faber) Armitage's latest book, might interest you.
He's mapped the sky in a long sequence of short, lyrical poems
that take individual stars, constellations and their names, and give them
new light. The book starts with four or five typically quirky
longer poems, and ends with a brilliant verse-play involving a group
of teenagers during a total eclipse.

Best,

Anthony

Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend.
Inside a dog, it's too dark to read! -- Marx

As Marx said, he was the one who got to be the professor because he was
the one who had read a book. He remembered it well. It was green.

unless of course, Dave, you're doing a variation on Dug Rothschild's

I like the story about the man who approached the diner at the end of the
road, where it branched off towards an unmarked, but well guarded gate. (It
is a good metaphor for questions of that kind.) There was a man and a woman
working in the diner. A stranger, probably a peddler or one kind or another,
drove up to the diner and went in. He ordered a meal. While eating, he asked
the man behind the counter: "say, do you know what they do behind that gate,
down that road next door to here". The man behind the counter answered:
"yes, but I would have to kill you if I told you about it.".

That's it, end of story.

I like also the line from old Bill: "there are more things in heaven and on
earth than are dreamt of in your philosophies". I think that is accurate,
but it might be a paraphrase.

That is the only postscript to that story.

What makes you think that two quanta cannot have identical futures ?

It is absurd that your thinking would be so severely limited. It is unlikely
but it is certainly possible.

Unfortunately, I think I unwittingly injected a certain amount of
(unintentional) ad hominem in my last response; I apologize, Morpheal,
if that rubbed you the wrong way. When all you know of someone are his
ideas, then attacking the ideas gets awful close...

To respond:

Nothing. However, the apparent promise of parallel development made
by two identical particle clouds is just that -- a promise. As far as
we can tell (and by "we", I mean the people who spend their time staring
into aptly named cloud chambers), there can be nothing "behind" the
particle clouds to tell us where a wavefront will collapse upon observation
or disturbance. At the risk of lecturing you, it's the hidden variable
theorem. There is nothing inherently similar about two quanta that
follow the same path; their behaviour is governed to a certain extent
by "true" physical randomness[*], which may or may not average out in
the macroscopic case.

You can certaintly deny the validity of physics, but if you're going to
use physics to make a point about consciousness and language, then you
have to accept it. Unless you're an armchair physicist who sends crabbed
green ink missives about Mayan civilizations and quantum gravity to the
Physics Review, which I trust you're not. Besides, I've always found the
subject interesting enough without the fakery.

I'm not sure if the rest of the list is interested in the disagreement,
so perhaps we should continue this backchannel?

> It is absurd that your thinking would be so severely limited. It is unlikely

I'll take that as a veiled compliment.


best wishes,

        Simon

Jordan on the money. What ever it is, I'm against it.

How much in Canadian for kootenay. I just got paid man, got me a pocket
full of t(w)ooney's.

As for my plans: I am planning to print out a list of everyone here,
read all of your books and conduct an interview of you'all. Here are a
few questions to start answering:

In that book of yours that I am planning to read shortly after the
interview, because we're like that, why the astringent use of the
hemistich shortly before the epirrhematic syzygy?

Do you believe the scandal of Ellis Wynne tearing apart the dyfalu
technique of Dafydd ap Gwilym three centuries later might have
influenced the third piece in the book two centuries afterward?

Listichki,

I have quit my job <cheers all around> and am headed East.  (I will receive
Poetics through the Monday digest.)  Stops will include Irkutsk, Ulan Ude,
Vladivostok, Ternei, Khabarosk, San Francisco (August 19), Los Angeles,
and a long string of unknowns ending in DC at a friend's wedding party on
September 19.  If anyone knows how to make the LA to DC run cheaply
while still seeing the countryside on the way, let me know.

Summer reading: Right now I'm reading Vineland and Danil Kharms.  I'll be
hauling the Rothenberg/Jorris anthology the whole way, and I plan to get it
autographed by any throat singers I encounter.  I'll also bring my book of
Akvarium lyrics so I can continue to osmose Russian.  Chuki chuki,
banana puki.

Thanks to the whole list for entertaining me in my secretarial chair.  Thanks
especially to Henry G., Alan Sondheim and Miekal And for their responses
to various queries.

Don't get in any juicy arguments while I'm gone.

A question for you listites: what are instances of writing "out of" (however
you would see this) a culture other than one's own which seem to you to
WORK, ethically as well as aesthetically, or do you see this inevitably as
an impossible task?

Yesterday I finished Wesley Brown's Tragic Magic, his first novel and a
singing one it is.  (Also aggregiously OOP, if any publishers are trolling
for worthy.)  And just before that Ron Padgett's Creative Reading, which is
terrific.  In the pile: 45 journals that have wung in since I last had a

Speaking of Steve Lacy, does anybody know where I can get either a tape or a
CD of Sidelines, his work with pianist Michael Smith of about 20 years ago?
Neither CDNow or any of the Lacy websites seem to have it available. It was,
as I recall, transcendant.

Ron, don't know the answer to your question but figured I'd recommend to
all another wonderful Lacy album, *Reflections*, consisting of all Monk
tunes, with Mal Waldron & Elvin Jones.  Great stuff.  -m.

this fish had to bite

so many questions --

how does one know for sure what *one's own culture* is?

what is culture?

what is a culture?

what is the exact border between *own culture* and *other culture*?

some say men and women inhabit different cultures --
by extension, maybe everyone has his/her own culture?

how long does one live in an other culture before it becomes own culture?
does it take generations?  if so how many?

if you are an american, say fifth generation, and the culture you grew up
in is different from the one your parents grew up in which is different
from the one their parents grew up in, what's your culture then? and
wouldn't it make some difference if you were alabaman or alaskan,
appalachian or a new yorker?  what is american culture?  today my students
asked me if i had a gun when i lived in america. i said i'd only seen one
outside of a shop once.  anyway that's their concept of american culture.

if culture is like mold or yeast and grows on/in you what does that say
about otherness?

influence is so strong a force, imagine living somewhere for a long time
and your pronunciation of your mother tongue changes.  your vocabulary
changes.  you forget idioms, especially prepositions.  someone asks you if
you are indeed a native speaker of your language, you speak so
haltingly...your attiudes change. . . your gestures... the tv shows you
watch and the food you eat...then what's your culture?  and what would be
so impossible or unethical a task about writing out of or into or through
or beside or behind or between the cultures that inhabit you?


I just read Daisy Bates in the Desert; A Woman's Life Among the Aborigines

It's by Julia Blackburn, not Daisy Bates.  I think it "works."

The writings of Lafcadio Hearn do not throw me into fits of political or
aesthetic indignance.

I think I could probably think of more, lots more.  And it occurs to me
that so many writers work from such a defamiliarized anthropologist-on-mars
state that even "one's own" culture becomes most deliberately otherized.

Anthony --

        Thanks for your response on Armitage; _CloudCuckooLand_
sounds like an interesting venture indeed -- the few selections
of Armitage I've seen so far have all were on a similar theme
(getting out in a boat and hauling in fish). Perhaps this is his
M.O. when stealing into new (?) territory -- turning something
over and over, watching the shadows.

        I'll try to reach the Bloodaxe folks in the UK, although
it might be a better shot to wait until I get there in person
later this year. Does anybody have any suggestions for a reading
list for the London scenes? I'm hoping to make a stop down at the
Poet's Cafe sometime in late August.

Susan, i find this a fascinating question....What really intrigues me is
the question of **what is one's own culture**;......and what isn't.

*and i note with some fascination that you lean toward the possibility
that such writing-out-of would be unethical, even as you frame the
question...

*There are a lot of variables regarding class, gender,
period...Even when one is staying "within"  "one's own" culture!

*For instance i have been reading The Pirates of Pen's Chance; after one
of it's authors (D. Barbour) mentioned it on the list i secured it for a
month on interlibrary loan.  It is  by the way one of the most astonishing
books of poetry i've ever encountered, and it's a shame it is OOP and very
obscure and rare (in this country).

*But, are the poets in that book, contemporaries of ours, part of the same
culture as some of the texts they write through (SHakespear, Stein,
dylan's "LIke a Rolling Stone")? In what sense is one part of the same
culture, if the experiencial matrix informing the work is perhaps very
distant...?

*(i don't recall if the Pirates write thru anything that could be called
"non-western"..and the book is at home right now; maybe Douglas could
remind me about that..)

*Is there going to be something **unethical** if i "write thru" a text
which is (oh i don't know) a transcribed Yoruba ceremonial song, which
wouldn't be unethical if i wrote thru a poem from Bag O'Diamonds, because
in the latter case i somehow (supposedly) inhabit "the same culture" as
the source text??

*These may sound like rhetorical questions, the way i'm saying them; but
while i also *lean* in a certain direction, i really don't think i have a
solid anser, yet.

*Maybe part of what i'm getting at is:  there is
something *inherently* "exploitative" about writing thru.

*Unlike most presentations of another culture (in an anthropology
textbook, in a museum exhibit, in a lecture) writing thru strategies do
not claim to be representing an other with authenticity, respect,
accuracy.  Quite the opposite!

*Yes OK, there is often a strong element of respect, even homage...cf.
about half of the Pirates book, rooted in Stein source texts; but even
this "respect" element is not always present..and certainly "authenticity"
never is!

*But is it true that not understanding someone else, will lead to a degree
of travesty that could be racist or xenophobic, in some way, even given
the peculiar angle at which one writes thru (or out of, as you put it)??
Yes i think likely so.

*But when the great ethnopoetic texts, the Rothenberg et al. anthologies,
starting with America a Prophecy, present non-western works, it is well to
keep in mind that due to aspects of translation, presentation, selection
and context (and decontextualization vis-a-vis the text's original
life-space)  much is being if not distorted exactly then...reimagined.

*All in all, i return in my own mind to the point i've made above:  that
"writing thru" is a devious and peculiar strategm to begin with.  And i'm
not sure to what extent one is violating a chinese or nigerian (or gay or
african-american) text, more than one is a white straight male euro text,
by subjecting it to one's own underhanded agenda....

Mark: It seems to me that the difference lies in the power relationship. No
matter how badly I mangle the Philadelphia Mainline crowd by writing
through an imagined protagonist I do very little damage to that not
terribly vulnerable crowd. If my protagonist lives in a trailer park the
potential damage is much greater.

That said, I recommend always Jaime de Angulo's _Indian Tales_.

Do Indians (the other kind) read Rudyard Kipling?

Well, this gets to one of the prime secrets of da craft - I'm hesitatin' to
divulge to youse guys & gals!  Plus I juss writ a mini-essay on it an I doan
wanna spill da beans juss yet! Ey, I only got 26 cards ta play wid anyways,
I gotta consoive my hand!

Lemme juss say dis.  Emily, as I awready said inda essay, is ona da few that
takes a stanza where it wanna go.  But I loin it frum da Rooskies cause it
so crystal clear an simple, say in dem Voronezh poems a Mandelstam which I
been readin again lately.

So hey I ain't gonna give it away free today - but see if youse can figure
it out from dis - it ain't a poem, juss an example of sompin -

Cicadas were stretching their legs in the summer shade.
Out on the baking highway, flat and straight,
it was a sort of droning curve I heard

off there in the distance out of sight -
a steady modulation they made
over the bend of the horizon - part

of night torn off, hiding in the wood.
The highway rolled along (one way station right
after another).  Cicadas boomeranging in my head.

OTHER
British and Irish Poetry since 1970
Edited and with an introduction by Richard Caddel and Peter Quartermain

The most significant US anthology of innovative poetries from the UK and
Ireland in over 25 years.=20

When most Americans think of contemporary British poetry, they think of
such mainstream poets as Ted Hughes, Philip Larkin, and Geoffrey Hill. Yet
there is a vibrant, diverse alternative poetry movement in the UK,
inspired in large measure by the work of such significant mentors as Basil
Bunting and J. H. Prynne. There is growing interest in this work in the
United States--as alternative American poetries express increasingly
transnational concerns--and yet almost none of it is available here.=20

OTHER is a highly focused anthology bringing together several important
strands of English-language poetry that are not otherwise so readily
accessible. It includes work by 55 poets, among them Cris Cheek, Brian
Coffey, Fred d'Aguiar, Allen Fisher, Ulli Freer, Randolph Healy, Linton
Kwesi Johnson, Wendy Mulford, Tom Raworth, Denise Riley, Catherine Walsh;
a critical introduction addressing such topics as the interaction of
British and American poetic traditions; and brief biographical and
bibliographical notes on each poet.=20

"In the past two decades, British and Irish poetry have undergone a silent
revolution. While the mainstream media present us with a 'Britain' still
writing poetry under the sign of Philip Larkin or Ted Hughes, a number of
strong oppositional voices have emerged, voices committed to a radical
rethinking of the 'Movement' and its tepid aftermath. Rick Caddel and
Peter Quartermain have produced an excellent anthology of this
breakthrough poetry. No one interested in the 'turn' of poetry in the late
twentieth century will want to miss it."--Marjorie Perloff

"Caddel and Quartermain have gathered an intellectually and aesthetically
challenging kaleidoscope of poems--fundamental information for anyone
interested in contemporary writing. OTHER is the best anthology of British
and Irish poetry now available."--Charles Bernstein

Coming in December 1998

poetry including Larksong Signal (1997), and editor of Basil Bunting:

I just finished reading Molloy.  I am reading Malone Dies.  I will read
The Unnamable.

Favorite apothegms of dubious worth:
        "To restore silence is the role of objects."
        "Everything divides into itself, I suppose."

Favorite exclamation: "Ah shilly-shally."

Favorite morbid dilation:  "And once again I am I will not say alone, no,
that's not like me, but, how shall I say, I don't know, restored to
myself, no, I never left myself, free, yes, I don't know what that means
but it's the word I mean to use, free to do what, to do nothing, to know,
but what, the laws of the mind perhaps, of my mind, that for example water
rises in proportion as it drowns you and that you would do better, at
least no worse, to obliterate texts than to blacken margins, to fill in
the holes of words till all is blank and flat and the whole ghastly
business looks like what it is, senseless, speechless, issueless misery."

Favorite inscrutable summation:  "From their places masses move, stark
as laws.  Masses of what?  One does not ask."

I still don't see it.....Your reply doesn't really address the points i
was making at all (of course, that's probably 'cause you don't think
there's much *to* them, and there may be something in that..)

*If you write thru a text by someone in a trailer park, are you mangling
them?? Or, can you mangle them???

*See, this is my whole point (and i believe it's a fascinating and
important one, and credit to susan for raising it):....Just what are you
**doing** to someone by responding in this way to their text?  Is it
"their" text?? Is it *part of them*...Which i think is a commonsense
point-of-view much held by all kinds of people, about texts and other
intellectual/artistic productions...It sounds to me like you feel the text
is *part of* the person living in the trailer park.  It would have to be,
perhaps, in order for you to *hurt them* thru it...Sounds a little like
the use of nail clippings and hair, to cast an injurious spell on someone.

*Your point about relations of power, is well taken; but was sort of
implicit in my first post.  That's why i brought up things like museum or
textbook depictions of other cultures...Is a poem "written out of" a
non-western text *exactly* like a museum exhibit, that can easily be
denigrating and insulting if it misrepresents another people's culture?

*Of course, your example seems ("imagined protagonist") more about just
locating a fictional story or persona in another culture...i took writing
out of, in susan's term, to mean "writing thru".  If (as i so often do) i
totally misunderstood the thrust of her quesiton, i apologize.  But will
take back the praise i've directed at her, and award it to myself.  Since
the topic i've been addressing is, as i say, somewhat interesting and
important.

*at least, to me

Ron,

_Sidelines_ was released by Improvising Artist's, Inc (IAI  37.38.47) in 1977.
Are they around anymore? I've never seen any of their stuff on cd. It's a
marvelous duet. Backchannel if you'd like a copy -- pops & all.

Transcendant???

btw, there's a RealAudio performance/interview with Steve Lacy at:

http://www.kcrw.org/g/index.html

recent reads:
just finished Peter Gizzi's _Artificial Heart_ -- a coupla pieces in there are
real knockouts.

Dee Morris' _Sound States_

Lisa Cooper's great little (jazzlistening) poem from Chax: _Tilt Rail_ ("the
name of this song is the name of this song") -- & too, Tenney Nathnason's _One
Block Over_ grabbed my attention & wants a second look ("imaginary gardens
with real poems in them")

rereading w/ astonishment, after losing my mother in April, Hilda Morley's
_What Are Winds & What Are Waters_ &  Tom Mandel's _Prospect Of Release_

Dave Brubeck catches (or caught) a lot of flack from a lot of people
when he performed Jazz music with a "classical" (Western) style. I'm
not sure if the critical apparatus was in sufficiently high gear (heh)
to start talking about the ethics at the time, but there were certaintly
very angry reactions that based their objections on aesthetic grounds.

There's something false about "writing through" ("roitin' chrew"?) when
it's done poorly. I think the vague sense of ethical objection that arises
when you read it comes from memories of blackface comics and various other
parodies and from the sinister "compliments" paid to various races that their
culture embodies this or that particular quality better than others. Whether
these elements are actually present in a work can be up for debate, but
it's kind of like using "liebenstraum" without an understanding of its
historical context. Most of the poorly done "writing throughs" I know are
pathetically well intentioned.

It doesn't have to be done poorly, though. I'm not sure if it counts, but
the first work that sprang to mind when this thread came up was Berryman's
_Dream Songs_, which I think hit pretty close to the nerve center of a lot
of Americans in their use of black language and jargon.

What about the Haiku?

I am very confused about this.

What is the actual difference between a "Turing machine" and
an "Enigma engine" ?"   There must be a difference, must there not, between
those two devices ?

Can anyone clarify that, somewhat ?

Also can anyone define, in relation to each other:  Enigma, Colossus,and ENIAC ?

(Not as simple as it seems.)

     I'll be teaching a short class on Postmodernism literature at our
     community college.  Does anyone know of a good anthology that contains
     Postmodern Prose?  I'm looking for some short works.  I'd like
     something equivalent to the poetic anthologies of Hoover and
     Rothenberg.

Thanks, Mark, Mark, Simon, Nada.  I had in mind both writing-through and
also representation -- which is what the Berryman would qualify as, yes? --
and yes, cultures defined in a variety of ways (gender but yes, also money,
regional accent, job), and work that defines itself as fiction as well as
that which is defined as ethnography or . . . poetry.

For five years several years back I did PR for anthropology faculty (as well
as other disciplines) and did have a hard time with observation's goal being
a generalization, a summation, of a group of individuals or of individual

is the question I leave open.

There's more to say, but I'm late elsewhere.  Other MODELS out there of
attempts that were interesting?

This may be out of date . . .been scrolling up the inbox after several
heavy days. In any case : The British poet, painter & polymath, Alan
Fisher, has poem/s titled (I think) "In a Hilbert Space." Sorry I cant find
in which of his many books. And surely he qualifies for the rubric
"Language Poet," as long as that's not heard as reductive. Perhaps Ken
Edwards or Chris Cheek, who used to be on this list, can supply further
info.   David

"Turing machine" is a term applied to any machine that has certain very generalized properties. It's a
term used mainly in theoretical computer science. All modern computers are Turing machines. It's a
mathematical blueprint for all computers, Turing's formulation of the properties a computer should
have. As geometry is to architecture, so is theoretical computer science to computer science.

Though I'm not entirely certain about the term 'Enigma engine,' I presume that it refers to the Enigma
device Turing helped devise used to crack the Nazi codes. Usually the term 'engine' refers to a
software construct, the central code involved in driving a program. A language engine, of sorts. So
the Enigma engine would be the core software involved in the Enigma project.

By the way, the Greek for riddle is aenigma, which also means mystery. Really good riddles. Really
good.

Kenneth Patchen (d. 1972) is still in the phone book in Palo Alto,
California, but his number doesn't answer.  Anyone know where he might

I had another response describing the "Enigma engine" as a German
interchangeable cylinder cypher machine. However, the term is used, very
loosely, both ways.

Your answer is essentially the one that gets fullest marks on that quiz.
I was being somewhat tongue in cheek as to the Turing and Enigma distinction.
However, you get some more marks on the quiz if you can explain why the
hardware for Enigma was so extremely different from that of Colossus. I have
seen a photograph of the reconstruction of the hardware configuration, that
was published not so very long ago in the newspapers, and it was absolutely
mind boggling and astounding, considering when it was built.

>By the way, the Greek for riddle is aenigma, which also means mystery.
Really >good riddles. Really good.

So mysterious that Enigma was ordered dismantled by Winston Churchill,
claiming that the machine was "too dangerous" to leave it functioning.

Figure that mystery out and you get the bonus points.

Isn't there supposed to be an issue on international poetry edited by Charles
Bernstein out any minute?  I'm wondering if anyone knows if this issue is out,
is ever coming out.  So far none of my searches have turned up anything.
Maybe someone can guide toward info regarding this.

Thanks,

Susan,

When you wrote...

For five years several years back I did PR for anthropology faculty (as
well
as other disciplines) and did have a hard time with observation's goal
being
a generalization, a summation, of a group of individuals or of individual
groups.  This may not be the inevitable result of writing acts, though this
is the question I leave open.

...not sure what sort of anthropology faculty you're talking about here.
Anthropology faculty are like Poetry/Literature/Creative Writing faculty,
in that many of all of the above still cling to out-dated methodologies,
praxis, modes of inscription, etc.  This kind of statement seems like
summarizing the state of contemporary poetry based on what's happening at
the MFA program at ____________ (fill in almost any institution).

I think anthropologists, innovative anthropologists, have done some of the
most significant writing to date on the subjects you put forward.
Certainly Clifford's books on _Writing [through] Culture_, _The Predicament
of Culture_, the new one _Routes_; Johannes Fabian's _Time and the Other:
How Anthropology Makes Its Object_; Lila Abu-Lughod's work (esp. essay in
_Recapturing Anthropology_ on being "halfie"-- half "native" & half "other"
where one is doing her/his fieldwork); Kirin Naryan's _Storytellers,
Saints, & Scoundrels_; and the list goes on & one &...

Another magnificent text of note is Juan Felipe Herrera's _Mayan Drifter:
Chicano Poet in the Lowlands of America_ (Temple): Herrera has graduate
degrees in both cultural anthropology and poetry (MFA), & brings much
insight to the questions of representation, writing (through) culture, etc.

Picking up on Blanchot's ideas of "the fragmentary" in writing, the
anthropologists I've encountered have been equally as interested in these
points: NOT in summarization.  And then there's Gerald Vizenor's wonderful
book on this, too: _Manifest Manners_.

OK, I'll stop:  I'm off to do fieldwork this weekend (I kid you not!) in
Northern Minnesota on the infamous Polka Mass.

later...

Mark

Dear List Members:

I feel  like this question is sort of on the outer fringes of the strands
concerning MFAs, etc., but being a student (possibly until I perish) and
not as of yet in the world of "Academia", I pose this question to those who
are in a position to know:

Is it better (if you intend to teach at any institution other than a public
high school) to have an MFA or to go on to a PhD???

I understand that in some instances the MFA is looked upon as a "terminal"
degree, but you don't often hear (anymore) of someone with an MFA landing a
cushy and tenured position at a university somewhere...

Just curious as to your thoughts on this...

Brent,

I want to say something or other about the tenure track not really being
all that cushy, but then again it beats hell out of any of the other
jobs I've had.  (My grubling about life here in the ivory tower plays
well at faculty meetings but my friends who work at other kinds of jobs
tend to hoot with derision when I complain.  But man, this tweed suit
gets hot in summer, especially under the dark robes and mortarboard...)

So here's my semi-cynical answer to what seems like a semi-cynical
question -- this is meant as practical advice about the way things
happen, which isn't neccesarily the way they ought to happen:

To get an MFA, a PhD or both -- I suppose it all depends what you want
to do.  The ads for positions in creative writing tend to ask for both
an MFA and book publication now, and some experience with teaching.  In
a way this is a catch-22: to get a teaching gig you need to have had a
teaching gig.  But in many MFA programs you do end up doing a fair bit
of teaching.  I suspect that you'd have to be a pretty established
writer to get much of a hearing without an MFA, which seems more than a
bit myopic, really.

If you want anything other than creative writing classes and maybe the
occasional intro to lit class, you'll probably need either a PhD or some
pretty influential friends, preferably both.  And the hiring committee
will want you to have published "creative" and "critical" work.  Unless
they're hiring up at Buffalo, they probably won't be sympathetic to the
notion that such distinctions aren't always as clear as they may seem.

Having both degrees seems to help, since more and more colleges and
universities want people who can teach a variety of courses (and, again,
committees tend to rely on degrees as a guide to knowing who can teach
what -- I don't think we're in Black Mountain any more, Toto).

R.A.

   Dear Brent---
    Good specific "practical" question.
    I don't know if there is such a thing as a "cushy" academic job.
    Tenure certainly doesn't equal cushy these days,
    but since I have neither I tend to sometimes conflate them too...
    especially since I have a creative writing masters AND a Scholalry
    Ph.D.
    I think that nowadays, however, you won't find too many recent Ph.D's
    with those tenured jobs either....
    If you're thinking CAREER, thinking DEGREE, by itself, means anything,
    get a time machine quick and go to the glory glut academic years
    of yippie agent orange and viet-niks.
    I am not complaining right now (at least I think I'm not)
    about going to Bard's MFA program one summer, then dropping out
    because I got into (with T.A.) Temple for 2 years (M.A. Program;
    at a time when I didn't realize Brown or Iowa would put me on a
    certain proper track or loop more easily so I'm told)....
    then, after realizing that an MA (and I doubt the lack of a letter
    F made any difference) didn't mean much, and turning 30, and
    losing my mother, and publishing my first full-length book, and
    getting in SULFUR, NAW, APR, etc., and still not being able to
    even get an adjunct creative writing (or literature) gig,
    decided to go to an MFA Program (to study with James Tate).
    I wasn't funded, however, so went only briefly....
    and then I guess "fell in love" with Shakespeare Criticism,
    or the generic possibilities in working within the form of
    a Ph.D. dissertation, and "jumped ship" and then schools
    and got into SUNY'S PH.D program (also unfunded, but I thought
    that would change. Cuomo was still governor then!)
    Regardless, then, of my own choices (for which I take some
    --if not quite all--responsibility) that have led to this debt
    andthe verge of default (regardless of my own aversion toward
    Newtorking those "in power"), I think I'll get a job.....
    It will just take longer, but in that time of waiting I'm
    trying to see that the more money you make the more you must work.
    Well, I hope this answer lites the preverbial cushion....
                 c

My own plan, Brent, is to forgo the MA (or MFA - big waste anyway, with all
due respect) and go straight to the PhD. program. Several of my professors
here at the University of Colorado have advised me that this is "the thing
to do." Besides which, I'm 41, and getting no younger. However, it all
depends what your long term plans are. And how much time and money you feel
like spending. I hope  to enter a tenure-track teaching post at a decent
university. Before the comet pops a cap in the planet's head.

Good recommend, btw, on the new Gander book. There's some stellar work in
there.

Hi Brent,

There's no guarantee that either degree will get you a tenure position. The
market right now is simply not that big, and yet the universities continue
graduating MFA's and PHDs. If I were you, I'd stop to consider the market
and your reasons for wanting an advanced degree: for a gateway to future
employment (good luck) or for the pleasure of teaching, reading, and
writing. I suppose at one time the two went hand-in-hand, but today there
are far too many being accepted into the graduate schools with the
understanding that one's pleasure can lead to a find job. That's just not
the case, nowadays.

Good luck!
R

or howzaa bout something completely different and try not to think of your
capacity to feed and clothe and house yourself as necessarily having to be
an identity issue - as long as you are going to have those (am i a
teacher, a poet, a shell-collector, a dog-walker, etc) why not let it be a
little loose or better yet forget it - anyone can do anything really,
being a high powered exectuive is a lot of dialing a phone or ordering
someone to get your mail or having fixing a tie or decisions - sure,
problem solving and all that but in the end this seems a lot of hmm
well-what-would-i-like-to-label-myself-at-cocktailparties sentiment

mfas seem like a choice for time in some cases, no - immediately presently
to have it and be doing that - debt sure and everything, your always
paying for something when your 'in the real world' -

just finishing justine - everyone really just wants to fuck you and as
long as you enjoy it too they have nothing over you right - certainly
Sade loved prison - not that everything cant  also always be a Trial

dear chris stroffolino et al
also wanted to ask the 'real world' or not so real world, ie what they
dont tell you right now, consequences of plain ole default - being young
naive in love all that, the prospect of bad credit (no car no house for a
long time) wage garnishment and tax refund garnishment dont all sound like
the end of the world, maybe even worth a good 30,000 in debt for school -
following up on brent's q.

In answer to Standard Schaefer's question:

99 Poets / 1999: An International Poetics Symposium, is scheduled for
publication as the Spring 1999 issue of  boundary 2 (16:2). I edited the
symposium with the help of a number of editor/translators, including Pierre
Joris (various), Lyn Hejinian (Russian section), Yunte Huang (Chinese
section), Ernesto Grosman (Latin American section), Stacy Doris (French
section), and Johanna Drucker (visual section), not to mention many others
who helped with translations and advise or contributed new works of poetics
for this issue.

Also, Chris Stroffolino mentions MY WAY. The University of Chicago Press
has just announced MY WAY: Speeches and Poems in their new catalog; it is
scheduled to be out by New Year's. The book weaves together essays, poems,
interviews, speeches, and harder to classify works, short and long. More

Subject:      1968 & alia (longish; "writing through" and more)

Down here in Puerto Rico, the students and faculty at UPR are threatening
to strike in sympathy with the telephone workers, who have been on
strike since the Governor announced the planned sale of the government
run telephone company. It's impossible to drive into Aricebo lately
without running into fund drives for the striking workers, who
gather on the roadside near sharp curves and collect money. As one of the
faculty here noted, students have been killed in the past at demonstrations
on the UPR campuses, although he didn't know over what or when.

Most of the workers on the roadside are amiable, almost jubilant, and (in
a largely working class town) the passers-by are quite friendly; I was in
San Juan a few nights ago where things didn't go as smoothly. My Spanish
is (unfortunately) too poor to really understand the "poetics" (there we
go) of the whole thing, but I do get some help from a colleague who
speaks Puerto Rican Spanish and is quite familiar with the dynamics of
labor unions here, having been involved in the Electrical Company conflicts
earlier in the decade.

In this climate, everybody's been bringing out their war stories from
the European campuses in 68 (France) and 70 (Italy); most of people I've
talked to took a highly apolitical stance at the time, and look back
mostly with amusement, although a few have stories of being accidentally
teargassed, and one person was attacked by police after he befriended
some of the local leaders so as to pass the blockade and get in to the
Physics building to work during the occupation.

There's a Jorie Graham poem partly about her experiences in France of '68;
I can't remember the title, although it is in her Selected. Can anybody
recall the title/post the text?


Susan -- there, of course, is model of "writing through"; the poet as a
witness to a class conflict (in an almost paradigmatic Marxist manner) who
feels the need to abandon a purely aesthetic response ("I, poet, record
what I see") to attempt a sympathetic or "merged" response with the
workers or students.

In Graham's case you have something like this:

        POET -- STUDENT -- WORKERS -- WORKER

Where the Poet is firstly herself, the self-expressive "Romantic", secondly
a student, participating in a group that she knows and is connected to in
emotional ways -- ties of friendship, sex, shared experience -- a
dynamism that can lurch between the inclusive (group identity) and exclusive
(return to the self as defined as "not the group"). And thirdly, as a
participant in a class struggle that can only be perceived by its effects;
a sort of sensation of absent presence; helicopters and police as secondary
effects of a greater, nonmaterial development; "class struggle" mapped out
by it's material boundaries and only glimpsed directly in the peripheral
vision of the poet.

The "writing through" occurs in the representation of this absence; in the
way that Graham tries to depict the Marxist flows so as to "break through"
this third stage and reach a consciousness beyond, the "worker".

Graham's poem, for me at least, always seemed to posess a certain complexity
that made depiction of struggle much more disturbing/powerful than a poem
who's primary goal was to simply observe the proletariat.

I can't speak to creative writing jobs, but for anything else you'll
want the PhD. But "better" must be understood as a relative term here.
For some idea of what you can expect an academic job search to look
like, see this account by Mary Corbin Sies:

        http://otal.umd.edu/~sies/jobadvice.html

She's speaking about American Studies, but the situation she describes
is general all over the humanities.

Also of interest -- to many here -- should be Alan Liu's "Palinurus: The
Academy and the Corporation -- Teaching the Humanities in a Restructured
World":

        http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/liu/palinurus/

The Palinurus site is still in its infancy, but as someone who spent
last weekend at a distance education conference (listening to
well-dressed, articulate people celebrate the demise of the research
university in the same tone of voice used to explicate the features on a
DAT player) I can attest to the urgency of the Palinurus materials.

Folks,

        SAWSJ member Jane Slaughter has offered the excellent attached
account of the GM strike for background and discussion.  A shorter version
of this essay will be appearing in In These Times (web site:
www.inthesetimes.com).  We very much thank Jane and ITT for allowing us to
distribute this.
        Please, if you haven't done so, indicate your support for the GM
Strike Support Statement that was e-mailed yesterday, by sending a message
to sawsj@sage.edu.  If you don't have a copy of the statement, it is on
the SAWSJ web site at www.sage.edu/html/SAWSJ.  And please, distribute the
statement as widely as possible.  We have about 400 signatures after the
first 24 hours!!!!!
        Finally, a regional announcement: anyone on this list in the SF
BAY AREA WHO IS INTERESTED IN ORGANIZING a network of SAWSJ-related folks,
please contact Ted Stolze at Ted1968@aol.com.  Other areas who are
organizing should also feel free to use the list to build contacts -- we
don't want to use the list for purely local announcement, but making
organizing contacts is another matter.

                                THE GM STRIKE
                             BY JANE SLAUGHTER

On Bristol Road in Flint, Michigan, the honking of car horns
never lets up. A honk signals the passer-by's support for the
picket line outside the huge Flint Metal Center, where the United
Auto Workers are on strike for jobs. If noise is an indicator,
Flint's residents are solidly behind their neighbors. Someone has
put together a tape of work-related songs--"Born in the USA,"
"Take This Job and Shove It"--that drowns out conversation.

Far from telling their employer, General Motors, to shove it,
however, union members are declaring forcefully that they want to
keep jobs in Flint. Tommy Jordan III, picketing in the union's
sister strike across town at the Delphi East plant, says his
father and grandfather retired from GM. He's striking "to save
our jobs," he says, "so our kids and grandkids can be working
here."

The two strikes involving 9,200 workers began June 5 and June 11
and quickly shut down most of GM's North American operations. The
Metal Center, a stamping plant, produces fenders, hoods and
engine cradles; Delphi makes a wide variety of small parts from
sparkplugs to speedometers that are used throughout GM's 29
assembly plants.

Twenty years ago there were 77,000 GM jobs in Flint; today there
are 33,000. It's still a company town, but the relationship
between workers and managers is different now than when high
school graduates routinely expected to begin a GM job at 18 and
retire 30 years later with a generous union-negotiated pension.
Today, jobs are harder to come by and not expected to last. At
Delphi East, says union financial secretary Stan Kubik, jobs have
shrunk from 10,000 to 5,800 in the last five years, with much of
the plant's production picked up in non-union shops or in GM's
Mexican factories. Says rank-and-filer Mary Cochrane, who has 21
years with the company, "in the next two or three years there
will be approximately only 500 jobs on-site. The availability of
new product is nil. There's nothing planned for the future.
Nothing."

On the other hand, GM plans to increase its vehicle production in
Mexico from 300,000 to 607,000 annually by 2006. The company's
Delphi parts division is already the largest private employer in
Mexico, with some 75,000 workers. It's this shift, along with
loss of market share, that partly explains GM's downsizing from
351,000 U.S. hourly workers in 1987 to 224,000 today.

There's another reason, though, for fewer GM jobs, and it's on
the table in these strikes as it was in the fifteen others the
union has called in the last five years. That policy is speed-up-
-and GM wants more of it.

John Bartholomew, a shop floor rep at the Metal Center, says that
in mid-contract managers announced they wanted to cut 191 jobs in
his area. "They were walking through the plant deciding, `We want
this job gone and that job gone.' If we have five people on a
press line, they want to cut it down to three. GM wants to
produce as many cars as they have in the past with fewer workers.
It's not gonna fly. You're supposed to strive forward, not
backwards."

Taking an unaccustomed aggressive stance in the media, GM exec
Donald Hackworth complains of employees who work five or six
hours for eight hours' pay. That's because they can make their
production quota early by busting ass--squeezing eight hours'
worth of work into six. Keith Bell, one of the Metal Center's few
young workers with only three-and-a-half years on the job, says
he can sit down an hour and a half before quitting time by
welding extremely fast and working through his break, "and when
you finish, you're dirt tired." This choice has been one of the
few workers have had over how their work day goes: essentially,
more boredom or more fatigue. GM now wants to abolish production
quotas and force workers to work continuously all day long.
Apparently, managers believe they can convince workers to set the
same pace for eight hours as they do for six.

There's precedent for that belief. The speedup at all three auto
companies--it's more advanced at Ford and Chrysler--has been
accomplished with union cooperation. Union officials have hoped
that by improving productivity, both through joint cooperation
programs and by simply turning a blind eye to overloaded jobs,
they could convince GM not to abandon its unionized American
workforce.

Menjuan Jordan, wife of Tommy, says, "We worked with them,
cutting down scrap, cutting down waste, adding ideas to make the
company run better. Our part was to bring the productivity up.
They're not following their part of the bargain, to keep the jobs
here." Mary Cochrane says she helped GM introduce "synchronous
manufacturing--that's the old term for lean production--working
right along with the site manager in training." At the Metal
Center, the union agreed to combine classifications and rotate
jobs in exchange for a $300 million investment in the plant. But
GM decided that union efforts were not enough and halted the
investment.

Overall, acceptance of both speedup and outsourcing (contracting
out work to lower-wage shops) has been International union
policy. Locals have been encouraged to "bid" against each other
for work by making concessions on work rules. But from time to
time a local decides that GM has gone too far, and the
International grants strike approval. The result has been a
piecemeal, non-strategic approach to what are universal issues.
Temporary victories have been followed by broken agreements.

At the Metal Center, the last straw was an outright slap to the
union's face: managers furtively removed dies from the plant over
the Memorial Day weekend, while negotiations were in recess.
Those dies were crucial to the launch of a new truck from which
GM expects big profits.

Some union members, such as electrician Bob Dunton, hope that
labor-management cooperation will resume after the strike. "The
Quality Network, the suggestion program, have really improved not
only productivity but also the lives of people that
participated," Dunton says. But others are fed up. Terry
Coutcher, a fork-truck driver at Delphi, says, "We struck in '96.
We weren't back to work a week and they were hauling our jobs out
of there. And yet we were still being told to cooperate." Last
Labor Day, for the 60th anniversary of the Flint sitdown strikes
that established the union at GM, the UAW's regional office
printed 5,000 T-shirts that read, "UAW: From Confrontation to
Communication."

Kevin Van Kirk, a former shop floor rep at Delphi, believes that
"in the 16-17 years the International has taken a more
cooperative approach, the bargaining power thy had has
diminished. What they did was to create all these appointed jobs
through the Quality Network for a lot of people. These officials
came to meetings and said, `This is the wave of the future, you
have to buy into this.' These people that have appointed jobs,
working 70-80-100 hours a week with nothing to do--that's the
payoff for letting the company do what they want to do."

Downsizing is an extremely difficult problem, of course, for any
union to tackle, even with all its ducks in a row. General Motors
presents its globalization strategy as a force of nature before
which no mortal can prevail. The strikes' most likely outcome is
that GM will promise a few specific jobs but maintain the
principle--and the practice--that management has the prerogative
to move work and speed up at will. GM managers feel the need to
impress investors with their commitment to downsizing, and are
willing to lose a couple of billion dollars (the company is cash-
rich this year) to make their point and discourage further
resistance. Top union leaders, who are not subject to election by
the rank and file, are less accountable.

On the picket line, every worker says the strike for jobs should
have happened years ago. Terry Coutcher voices the frustration of
many. "This has been brewing for a long time," he says. "Why they
waited till we were so weak, and the jobs already gone--I blame
that on the International. This should have taken place a long
time ago and it should be a national strike, instead of locals
taking them on."

The last posting was in regards to this debate. Start up a scam poetry
contest with your degree in order to legitimize the organization. Create
your own college. I would suggest getting an MA or PHD then jumping off
the academic wheel into pseudo-academia. It's dangerous out here but the
advantages are tremendous:
        1. There's more money if you go corporate, esp if yr one of them
lang-po computer dweebs like I've been called.
        2. No accountability for your statements and few repercussions. I've
never been accosted or fired by my employers over a difference in
opinion on the marginalization of poetry.
        3. No university head to impress. Ibid.
        4. College debt is easily repaid. Though I still appreciate the notion
that one should die $10,000 in debt.
        5. No need to suffer for your art. Come on, what century is this. At
least you can get a job as a repo-man for awhile. It's not a third as
crazed as folks make it out to be and the cash is primo. In the worse
case scenario, sell drugs to your former classmates. I could keep going
on ad infinitus. What I will say is this:

        I can do more today for the love of poetry than I could
        ever hope to achieve inside a university setting
        at least according to what my professor friends are
        telling me.

There are tenured friends who have had different experiences but I'm
talking about an age group of 28 to 40 who have graduated in the past
few years. Perhaps I'm wrong but I keep hearing these disheartening
stories over and over...

Be well

Actually you do know that you definitely do NOT have to go and find
the graves of the dead, for them to come and visit you.

They can do that, without your hunting up where they happen to be buried.

I have definitely met the dead.
Some of them are more interesting than most of the living.

"The "hot" issues of environmentalism--the possibility of major global
warming, the ozone "hole," species impoverishment, overpopulation and
its consequences--are issues that would be unknown and unknowable but
for the accomplishments of professional science. They exist only because
of, and specifically as products of, science."---from Higher
Superstition: The Academic Left and its Quarrels With Science by Paul R.
Gross and Norman Levitt
"The reduction of one unsolved problem to another is some sort of
progress, unsatisfying though it may be, but it is not an option in this
case. The frame problem is not the problem of induction in disquise. For
suppose the problem of induction were solved. Suppose--perhaps
miraculously--that our agent has solved all its induction problems or
had them solved by fiat; it believes, then, all the right
generalizations from its evidence and associates with all of them the
appropriate probabilities and conditional probabilities. This agent, ex
hypothesi, believes just what it ought to believe about all empirical
matters in its ken, including the probabilities of future events. It
might still have a bad case of the frame problem, for that problem
concerns how to represent (so it can be used) all that hard won
empirical information--a problem that arises independently of the truth
value, probability, warranted assertability, or subjective certainty of
any of it. Even if you have excellent knowledge (and not mere belief)
about the changing world, how can this knowledge be represented so that
it can be efficaciously brought to bear?...
What philosophers (and everyone else) have always known is that
people--and no doubt all intelligent agents--can engage in swift,
senstive, risky-but-valuable ceteris paribus reasoning. How do we do it?
AI may yet not have a good answer, but at least it has encountered the
question."---from Cognitive Wheels by Daniel Dennett

depends what you want to do.
are you a poet, a critic, a language artist?
what's the best way to keep yourself fed and able to access other interests
and comfort and still follow this muse of language?
being an artist in an academic (or most any form of) institution is a
multi-edged weapon. this is evidenced by  a lot of inbreeding, favoritism,
and the general lack of health (as evidenced by, among other things,
continued miniscule size of audience) of poetry in our society. maybe
academic niches are the best we can expect. and academia/teaching helps you
develop ortegers, influence other writers, who will help increase your
important and ability to earn money with publications, readings and other
engagements. if htis is your path, than phd is the way.
otherwise, one can write and grow in relationship with language in so many
other places. i did the mfa (& 10 year later returned for an ma in hopes of
getting into teaching). eventually realized i'm not  a teach i'm a poet. so
i have  a day job that usually doesnt interfere with my abilith to interact
with the world and language when the day of monetary compensation ends.

seeing all the responses recently for summer reading lists and the
implication of connection with the academic year makes me wonder how many
folks on the list are NOT part of a school setting, and how your job
schedule effects reading other people works and such.

The PhD is too much of a commitment to pursue "just" to be eligible for
certain teaching jobs.  I think the national average for the time it takes
to complete a PhD in English is 8 years or more; in my program, it's 7.  So,
as someone has already said and I want to second, it depends entirely on
what you want out of the time you spend in whatever program.

After working full-time and going to school at night for years, I
desperately wanted time to focus solely on my poetry while also dabbling in
graduate coursework to see if I really wanted to go for the PhD afterwards.
If you attend an MFA program in a strong English department, your MFA can
help prepare you for the PhD as well as give you some transferable coursework.

Also, don't be scared off from the PhD because you think it necessarily
means you will incur large loans.  Investigating programs' funding literally
pays off in the long run.  I was offered admission to several programs that,
in their offers, guaranteed one to two years of fellowship plus three to
five years of teaching.  Admittedly, these programs are somewhat rare, and
yet fortunately, some do exist.

Good luck,
Carrie

Of course this is absolutely true and I am appreciatively corrected -- once
again my haste in posting has reduced 3-D or 4-D to 2-D -- I should wait to
open my mouth until I've the time to follow through, eh?  Thanks.

well only to add to what's been said:  i don't see doing *anything* of such
proportions without passion, a love of justice, and a sense of urgency...

alla that aside, and to be a bit pragmatic about it:  there are so many
aspects of getting a phud (or a masters---but esp. a phud) that tax the
intellectual/emotional/spiritual from a bureaucratic/professional
orientation... that is, it's never simply a labor of love, even if it is
(as it should be) a labor of love... it's also labor, and it's also, in
subtle and in obvious ways, a pursuit of a job, a commitment to one of many
(if a finite number of) institutions... as this pursuit plays itself out in
the context of higher education, you can bet (your bottom-line dollar) that
the educational institution conditions this pursuit, complicates it in
whatever terms the institution itself is complicated (note the palinurus
website of alan liu's that matt kirschenbaum helpfully cites... the
corporate incursion---into the classroom in fact---is, from where i
(tentatively) stand, a real problem, and it's not about to go away any time
soon)...

i've always found sheer careerism (if you will) too much to bear, whether
as an english prof or as an engineer---one reason why i can't entirely
theorize/understand the english profession in terms of graduate education
alone (on this basis i don't agree entirely with cary nelson, as much as i
appreciate his provocations---which is not to say that being a grad student
= careerism, but only to extrapolate/amplify thence)... and yet it rings
somewhat hollow to me when someone tells me they're pursuing a phud purely
out of a love of same, as though money---life for that matter---could be
approached so cavalierly... or that they plan to use their phud in a
profession that requires only an undergrad degree... as though the
incredible (self-) saturation that finishing a dissertation entails, the
incredible training quotient that's part & parcel of a terminal degree,
could be air-lifted into another domain w/o a real sense of, well, loss...

i don't wish to suggest that the only thing to be done with a phud is teach
(two exceptional exceptions would be terrence malick and paul verhoeven,
both of whom hold phds---and of course there are phds in the private
sector, doing all sortsa things... i think of a friend/poet here in
chicago, bill fuller, who works in banking)... but teaching is after all a
primary gradient in pursuing a doctorate, esp. in the humanities---as might
be expected, b/c you're asking to be taught for such a long stretch!...
even if you see yourself primarily as a writer (i do), and see teaching as
a potentially decent way to make a living in the meantime (i do---even
now), you'll have to concede, i think, that teaching is part of what
pursuing a phud prepares one for, and that teaching requires itself that
passion, love of justice, sense of urgency i mention above (perhaps i go
too far in advocating this *here*?---i hope not)...

in any case, i don't find english depts. to be, in general, happy places
these days (were they ever?---you tell me)... there are all sortsa economic
stresses and strains, and all sortsa 'culture war' controversies, and a
great disparity between or among english depts. in major research
institutions and english depts. in less-established schools (again, most
english profs do not teach graduate students in english, or even primarily
english majors)... i like to think that, given a full(er) account of how
teaching/research/service is actually distributed in specific institutions
(which may require 2/2 teaching loads, or 5/5 teaching loads), those who
seek to participate in and contribute to better forms of higher learning
might be more prone to recommend with some wisdom necessary changes, new
directions... b/c it's clear to me that i'm already very much a bureaucrat
in what i do (what jody swilky and dan mahala have recently referred to as
the "geography of service" helps illuminate this fact), and it's also clear
to me that i need, if anything, to carve out more space for less
bureaucratic functions (spatial metaphors running rampant here, i know)...
at the same time [wink], i don't think it helps to imagine that a phud is a
classless pursuit, anymore than it helps to see it as a mere stepping stone
into the [take your pick] fortune 500 corporation, or up-and-coming
entrepreneurial enterprise...

seems to me that there's learning and transformation involved in every
sense---which is to say some risk... so:  not to be patronizing in the
least, but i'd recommend going in with one's eyes widefuckingopen...

for what it's worth///

best,

joe

Thanks to  Mark Prejsnar for his intriguing comments on writing through, &
the mention of _Pirates_. I think he's especially right about the inherent
invasive tactic involved:

*Maybe part of what i'm getting at is:  there is
something *inherently* "exploitative" about writing thru.

*Unlike most presentations of another culture (in an anthropology
textbook, in a museum exhibit, in a lecture) writing thru strategies do
not claim to be representing an other with authenticity, respect,
accuracy.  Quite the opposite!

My memory is that various forms of what we called (after bpNichol)
'homolinguistic translation' had to recapitulate another text (orm play off
it) already in english; but assuming the kind of 'loss' any translation
carries. We did play off some Romantic poets, Milton, Shakespeare, as well
as more contemporary writers, including a number of canadians/ Sometimes
the writing would be 'for' sometimes 'against' the original. And I guess
these pieces reveal that my sense of 'culture' is that it is an always
(already?) contested arena, & also a huge system of layers in each of us...

Some say the same about inter-racial and inter-cultural marriages and
relationships. Any sense of appropriation of the other as person or as
culture is seen in the same light, and whether accurate or false rendering.
This is at the very roots of what I would refer to as the "new apartheid" in
America between peoples of different cultural and racial origins. Of course,
it is not only happening in America. We have more of it in Canada than we
had ten or twenty years ago. It is much harder here, for example, for a
Caucasian to meet an oriental or negro person, beyond a purely business
interaction. Personal relationships are difficult and more strictly limited.
Marriages are extremely unlikely between groups. The latter is considered
the worst kind of misappropriation of another group's cultural property. The
person is the primary form of cultural wealth and for black culture or
Chinese culture to lose even one instance of a member of that culture is
seen by some as unacceptable.

The white with white, black with black, yellow with yellow, red with red,
mentality has grown by leaps and bounds, in the last ten years, and no white
is to have any black, yellow, or red culture as it is not their's for the
having. They ought, it is strongly stated, by innuendo and otherwise, keep
to their own, and their own cultural members and cultural manifestations. It
is often not unlike the relations enforced in the deep south of the United
States, with superficial deference and politeness from the servant to the
master, given by minority to majority in the conducting of day to day
commerce, but a deep and growing undercurrent of divisive hostilities and
closure underneath that surface of requisite, survival oriented, diplomacy.

Part of it seems to be a fear of one culture watering down another, and
somehow making it impure, or less than it is, by the inter-mixing of
cultures and races.
As though black will become grey if white is added, and red will become pink.

I have seen the same thing happen in ethnic situations. The ethnic
transplants keep to themselves, speaking their own language, matching up
with one another within that group, as though mixtures are taboo, and might
damage their cultural identity. Of course, it is often enforced by ostracism
to those who step across the cultural dividing lines and mix too freely.
This is more often applied to women than to men. Men can do so more easily,
whereas "their women" are kept to their men, and inter-cultural
introductions or liaisons are near to impossible in any regard that might be
construed as "personal".

Perhaps some instances of "writing thru" are attempts to bridge the gap and
step across the hardening lines. The result of thwarted and limited
opportunities to bridge the divide and understand the other worldview. At
least subconsciously.

It always saddens me, as someone to whom race or ethnic origin was never one
of the criteria that decides whether a particular personal relationship
might be desirable or satisfying as such. Least of all where it is
potentially intimate, rather than commerical. So I find the attitudes hard
to understand.

I can see though, that my own experiences could be the kind that prompt
someone to write thru, so as to make up, in some odd way, for the loss that
is felt in terms of the limits that oneself can do nothing about, because
they are imposed by another cultural group or by one's own chanced into
cultural affinity. If one is white, one cannot voluntarily give up one's
whiteness. If one is Italian one cannot give up one's Italianness. Also one
cannot, easily share what is one's own in that regard. It is largely
forbidden except to the same, of the same cultural origins. Instead I have
been frustratingly encouraged to take up my own Latvianness, to which I have
no personal affinity whatever, being born in England and educated in Canada,
even though my father was Latvian and my mother Estonian. I cannot become
black, red, or yellow, it would be argued. I cannot become Polish, Italian,
Irish, German or American, but I can become "Latvian". Whatever that really
is. I answer "bullshit" but my answer is not effective as to the day to day
of life, in the ways I would prefer it to be effective.

The whole scenario in North America as to race and ethnicity nowadays
reminds me more and more of what was written above the crematoria by the
Nazis in Germany:
"to each their own". It is a horrifying thought, but worth thinking about.

>*Unlike most presentations of another culture (in an anthropology
>textbook, in a museum exhibit, in a lecture) writing thru strategies do

>accuracy.  Quite the opposite!

I do not get that sense of difference, or opposite, in that regard.

So called "scientific" study of one cultural group by a member or members
of another cultural group is inherently subjective, and presumed to be biased
by cultural affinity. Even if it is good, hard, science, and as objective as
humanly possible, the group being studied and represented, more often
nowadays than not claims "misrepresentation" by the outsiders, or sometimes
deliberately misrepresents itself to the outsiders. It is more of a "you do
not understand us, because you are not one of us" mentality.

The claims as to authenticity, respect and accuracy, are claimed to be more
alike to writing thru strategy, by the other side. It is inevitably this
culture tainted representation of that culture.

In essence I think you have overstated the difference between how writing
thru is often perceived, and how scientific observation and reportage is
perceived.

Is the alternative to "writing thru" and withstanding accusations of
"cultural misappropriation", as vicarious attempts to breach the rising and
increasingly fortified cultural and racial walls, the belief in "to each
their own" ?  That becomes the real question. It is terrifying, as to what
it might mean. It is even more terrifying that it might be that we have no
real say about it. We are simply "culture victims" in the making.

Go Morpheal! (well, except for the "oriental" & "negro" part)

This subject raises an important, everpresent (to me) question: when does the act
of writing "break down" in so-called real-life? Perhaps more offensive than the
idea of appropriating a culture with one's writing, is the idea that one's
response to other cultures simply IS writing.

Subject:      protest of award for Yamanaka
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I went to a meeting by the Association for Asian American Studies
yesterday. The Association has awarded Lois-Ann Yamanaka's _Blu's
Hanging_ an award. Many members of the Association have protested the
award, arguing that the book presents racist representations of
Filipino/as. In Hawai'i there is a stereotype that Filipinos are
sexually deviant (partial to incest, rape, child molestation). In _Blu's
Hanging_, a family of Japanese-Americans live next to a family of
Filipino-Americas. Members of the Filipino family commit various acts of
incest, rape, and child molestation.

The Association had a panel on this topic which I missed. And they also
held a roundtable forum on the issue which I attended. Apparently the
Association had for years been considering Yamanaka's books for the
award starting with _Saturday Night at the Pahala Theatre_ and
continuing with _Wild Meat and Bully Burgers_ but had never given her
the award. Each year there had been protest of some sort from the
membership. It was noted several times that of all these books, _Blu's
Hanging_ is the most problematic in terms of race. So to award the award
to this book has been seen as particularly insensitive.

At the roundtable many people spoke. The argument seemed to be split
around two sides. One side argued mainly that this was a freedom of
speech issue (which it really isn't; no one is suggesting the book by
banned, just that it not be rewarded). This side was represented by a
number of local writers who are not academics and by a number of
established Asian-American writers, also mainly not academics, from the
mainland. Statements were read by people like Amy Tan, Maxine Hong
Kingston, David Mura, etc. Wing Tek Lu, from Bamboo Ridge who publishes
_Saturday Night at the Pahala Theatre_, had a thick petition and
collection of statements in support of Yamanaka. Unfortunately there
were only copies for the roundtable participants so I didn't get to see
one. The other side was represented by a number of mainly local
academics. Many spoke movingly of the difficulties of growing up
Filipino/a in Hawai'i.

The roundtable felt caught between these two positions, neither
addressing the other. But for more information I would suggest looking
at the work of Candace Fujikane. She has a good article in the most
recent volume of _Social Processes in Hawai'i_ (1998, UH Press) on this
issue. She also posted a moving and complicated statement to the
Association's discussion list. Walter Lew forwarded it to me. I'm sure
he would do the same for you if you asked (or I could also).

At the conference, I was talking to Dorothy Wong and she told me how
many people at the conference had said that the protest was a Hawai'i
issue. I have to agree (which doesn't make it less important). When I
read _Saturday Night_ on the mainland it seemed clear that the poems are
told by an unreliable teenage narrator and the first poem, "Kala Gave Me
Any Kine Advice Especially about Filipinos when I Moved to Pahala," can
be read as a critique of racist stereotypes. But when I've taught the
book here, the first thing students often say is, here is a voice that
is my voice, which I've never heard taken seriously before. (It is an
amazing experience to teach this book here. Students really feel like it
changes their life and validates whole parts of their culture that have
been degraded.) And then the problem starts b/c this voice is the voice
of a teenage racist.

Also, it is crucial to realize that being Japanese-American in Hawai'i
(which Yamanaka is) is similar to being haole in terms of economic and
social power. (Race discussions repeatedly define class discussions.)
Whereas Filipino/as possess significantly less economic and social
power. It is often said that because Yamanaka writes coming of age
stories of planatation life that she is unwillingly to abandon the
rhetoric of marginalization and take responsibility for
Japanese-American complicity in the colonial (neocolonial?) power
structure. Her characters will grow up to set much of Hawai'i's policy.
What then?

To add to the problem, Yamanaka is reported as saying things like her
book is "true" and that she has known Filipinos like that and how she is
just reporting what she has seen.

I wished for more analysis of the book at the roundtable. One of the
ways that I have a lot of respect for Yamanaka's work is that she has
addressed the language issue in a way that a lot of writers here have
avoided it. Many local writers go through the creative writing program
at Univ of Hawai'i, Manoa which likes nature poetry and MFA short story
forms (some important exceptions: Morgan Blair, Susan Schultz, Rob
Wilson). Yamanaka's writing in pidgin puts forth a critique of these
forms that rivals the critique of American presence in the land that is
a part of the literature of Hawai'i.

I wished also for more discussion of what we do with a teenage racist
narrator. Fujikane repeatedly points out how important it is to avoid
saying that those who do not read this book as told by an unreliable
narrator are unsophisticated. I agree with her. But when do we stop or
start to read that narrator as unreliable (again, Fujikane has a good
point that in _Blu's Hanging_, the narrator sees the sexual abuse, she
doesn't just report it)? Is the unreliable narrator a flawed concept?
One built on elitist reading practices?

A vote is being held by the Association on this issue today. I'm not
sure what the outcome will be. The room felt very divided.

It was great to see many people who were not academics speaking up on
this issue. It is evidence that what one writes does matter, can carry
huge consequences to a community.

Disclaimer: please realize that since I am a mainland haole who has
lived here for less than a year that this report is not authorized.
Please supplement with other points of view (the Association discussion
might be a good place to start).

Which only goes to show that human beings, on average, even though they have
advanced degrees to their credit, cannot _think_.

No, not the Filipino's or their Japanese American neighbours. I do not refer
to them. I do not refer to Yamanaka either.

Why do I say that ?  Simply that too many people fail to read such things
as saying "there were certain individuals who did certain things to one
another, and they chanced to be Filipinos". In that instance it was a family
unit who chanced to be a family unit and Filipinos.

The work then would not be disparaging to ALL family units.

Neither would the work be disparaging to ALL Filipinos.

Why cannot educated people, even highly educated people, distinguish
something as simple as ethnic affinity, family affinity, racial affinity, or
even relgious affinity, as being completely DISTINCT from the actions of
individuals towards one another ?  Often we cannot seem to do that and end
up unable to even state any affinity as if that automatically makes all the
members of that named affinity automatically the same.

That is the same as saying: I knew a blue eyed person who was physically and
psychologically abusive to people he knew, THEREFORE if I say he was blue
eyed I am saying that ALL blue eyed people are abusive.

I've accidentally discarded Morpheal's message, but I still want to
respond.

     Certainly the representation in the novel described by Morpheal
is not in itself proof that the author intended to perpetuate a
stereotype or believes in the stereotype. That much simple logic
might point to, but the situation is not simple nor is simple logic
enough to account for it or respond to it. There is a history and a
context involved that the blue eyes of the syllogism don't carry.

M's logic somewhat resembles that used by defenders of the death penalty who
insist that racial bias be proved in an individual case, though statistical
evidence proves that black defendants get the death penalty much more
frequently than white defendants for the same or similar crimes.  I mean
that in prejudiced representations, each case, taken singly, could
offer the defense that Morpheal proposes, and the world could be flooded
with such images, creating and sustaining a stereotype, yet each new
one that came along would be immune to the charge of trafficking in
the stereotype. I am not suggesting that the author's guilt can be
proven, nor that the author is guilty, nor am I taking any stand on
any sanctions taken against the book--I only want to insist that such
a representation is not necessarily innocent by virtue of it being a single
instance and by definition not a general statement. The act of choice
that placed the representation in the book at a particular point in
history gives an emphasis to the instance which raises it beyond some
ostensible abstract status of singularity. The history of theory of
fiction is full of ideas concerning the universality of characters,
the representative nature of individuals or places. The writer has
presented an instance typical of a stereotype either consciously or
unconsciously; the difference can sometimes be discerned, though perhaps
not proved, by close reading, and if it's a conscious and not maliciously
chosen strategy, will be judged differently from a careless reproduction.
To those of you who could have said this, and more, and better (including
perhaps some transitions between ideas, I apologize.)

Subject:      Hawaii 5-0

Juliana Spahr requested other perspectives on the literary uproar she
described.  Here's one from somebody who's never read any of the authors
mentioned nor been to Hawaii:

A talented author who knows how to play various ethnic cards & grind her
own axe in the process gets some digs in about a rival ethnic group.
The local literary officialdom, whose purpose in life is to parcel out
grants & present official trophies, bumbles into that hornets' nest
without giving it enough thought (like the aforesaid author too, maybe?).
Lots of local or not local writers chew their nails -
"gee, this is one powerful talented writer!  Lots of people identify
with her writing!  But look what she's doing to the Filipinos! What
should we do?  Is this a campaign in the making?  Am I authorized to
make these comments?"  Nobody has the guts to say:
1) she's right about SOME Filipinos - this is a problem with them
[whether it really IS or not I, HG, have no clue--nor would I
sanction any listblab on this].  and/or 2) this author is taking cheap shots
at people in a chauvinist way which goes to show she either has a lot to learn
or is just plain second-rate, and here we are making a big deal out of
how great she is... a good writer takes the cheese out of his or her own
kind, rather than badmouthing scapegoats.  So I ask, why make this more
complicated than it is?  Why try to organize a group-think response?
Why don't you - you Hawaiians in the know - decide for yourselves what you
think, write it up, and if necessary, bump yourself off any official
committees that compromise your position?  What else is there to do?
Sure, you may want to call on the association to revoke the award.
Fine - but do you need us to tell you that?  I'm trying to eat some
Triscuits in peace! On my sofa, no less!
Figure it out for yourself, in all its shades of gray.

*** Newsreader keeps his cool, swallows fly

British television newsreader Jonathan Hill didn't want to make a
scene when a fly flew into his mouthduring a live broadcast - so he
swallowed it, newspapers reported Friday. Hill, 28, said his instinct
was to spit out the fly but he felt that would disgust viewers. "I
choked on my words but just couldn't spit it out on camera," said
Hill, who was reading the news on a Welsh television channel. "It's a
tea time show and viewers could have been made ill right across the
country. I had to be professional with so many peoplewatching. "There
was only one choice. I had to grin and bear it." Hill said that as a
dedicated vegetarian it was the first meat he had eaten in years. "I
definitely haven't got the taste for it back now," he said. (Reuters)

"[William Shockley's] basic rule for solving ANY problem is to go back
to fundamentals: "Try simplest cases."
Understanding is most likely to result, he says, from REDUCING the
situation to its simplest elements and proceeding from there. His famous
book on semiconductors follows the pattern: In Chapter I he sets forth
the comparison of atomic structures to parking lots, complete with
little sketches of cars to demonstrate traffic flow. By Chapter XV he is
explaining that "the wave function A (theta) for the hole-wave packet is
not an eigenfunction for the Hamiltonian for the 2N-1 electrons in the
valence band....
All this THINKING about THINKING thrust Shockley into a furious
intellectual and political controversy which he initially provoked in
the late 1960's and which continues, at a lower intensity, to this day.
In a letter to the National Academy of Sciences, and then in a series of
lectures and interviews, Shockley urged detailed study of a problem he
named "dysgenics" and defined as "retrogressive evolution through the
disproportionate reproduction of the genetically disabled." In plain
English, Shockley was claiming that, on the average, blacks are dumber
than whites. Thus high birth rates among blacks could lead to "decline
of our nation's human quality." "My research leads me inescapably to the
opinion," Shockley said, "that the major cause of American Negroes'
intellectual and social deficits is hereditary and is racially genetic
in origin." Shockley went on to propose a social policy to deal with
this situation: government should work to reduce birth rates among
low-IQ elements of the population, through programs such as tax breaks
for voluntary sterilization....
The instigator (e.g. Shockley) seemed to relish the stir he had
created...Those who have worked with him over the years invariably
describe him as "charming"; at scientific meetings he was known for
telling jokes and even performing magic tricks at the podium while
delivering his papers..."

Wrong thinking again.....Same problem as to logic.

No, it is not a problem with SOME Filipinos. Though that is a true statement.

It is a problem with some HUMANS. That is a truer statement.

Note particularly the emphasis on GENERIC CATEGORY.

The attribution of descriptors such as Filipino, man, heterosexual, member
of a family, man with blue eyes, etc., is increasingly becoming
misunderstood as meaning "some men with blue eyes beat their wives" when in
fact it means
some humans beat up on other humans. That particular instance happened to be
a man, a Filipino, perhaps with blue eyes (I don't know his eye colour),
etc., but in no way ought to be taken as implying that men do it but women
do not, blue eyed men do it but green eyed men do not, Filipinos do it but
Americans or Slavs do not, etc.

We could leave all the descriptive attributions out. Then we would lose all
sense of scene. That would be a real problem with writing. Of course writers
can become paranoid and avoid all affinity attributions, as to
sub-categories, and make everything generic. There are no men, no women, no
family members, no relational designations, no eye colours, no ethnicities,
but there is a story. Somehow that would not be really situated. Somehow we
need to describe the scene further than a generic meta-category. That seems
to be where the misunderstanding creeps in. Sometimes it sneaks into the
writer's comprehension as well as the reader's, but most often the latter.

How to overcome this ?  Change the way people write and describe scenes, so
that they only refer to the broadest generic meta-categories ?  Not quite.
Instead, teachers must teach students, early on, how to think more
logically, how to reason, how to comprehend such things without making false
attributions and false generalizations, and how to understand the writer's
setting up of scene for story. Of course, that implies that the teachers
have to be truly educated.

The writer being made paranoid of mentionning any sub-category, and cringing
as to having left out wolves, ferrets, avocados and other living things when
using the "human" meta-category becomes the extreme of ridiculous and yet
there is a tendency to push it that far. (Been there, and been pressured
with that kind of programming. So I know what it is about.)

Oh, well, we lose on that one. It is no longer required to be able to think,
or to learn to think, in order to be considered "educated" or to be a
teacher of others. Simply a fact of post-modern life.

Human beings are too programmed into thinking in binary terms.

That might seem strange and too radical an assertion, but it is true.

The matter and spirit distinction is at the root of the problem. The body
and soul problem is the same problem.

Science has followed that paradigm and looked mostly for bifurcations such
as the wave - particle duality. That following of a paradigm does not
necessarily
mean that any kind of duality is as fundamental a principle of nature as we
claim it usually to be. It is perhaps as likely to be a matter of subjectivity
and prophetic expectations becoming self fulfilling. It depends on how the
experiments are constructed, and that too depends on beliefs, does it not ?

What happens if we imagine a science that is based on a non dualistic
principle rather than on the dualistic paradigm we are so familiar with and
take so for granted ?  Do some new phenomena suddenly reveal themselves that
remained hidden by the fact of belief in dualism ?

I do not pretend an answer to that, only stating a question.

The current issue of The Nation has the best article I've read to date on
Araki Yasusada, by Forrest Gander. Part of a series of reviews of books on
Hiroshima & Nagasaki. It may be the best piece on poetry that's appeared in
The Nation since Hank Lazer's work some years back. And the excerpts there
from Yasusada certainly jump off the page in a way that contrasts starkly with
the treacle offered up by two former neighbors of mine from the city of

Emily's Riddle


There is a large house many storeys high, without doors.  Built of wood
and stone and brick, it withstands the strongest storms. The windows are
curtained or otherwise obscured (perhaps they are fogged over); one can
see almost nothing of the dark interior. No sound or light emerges from
within; no one has been seen looking out, half-hidden behind the shades.
The house is without electricity, gas, water and sewer; apparently unin-
habited, it seems nonetheless well kept up. The pathways around it are
clean, the sidewalks immaculate. Lovely rose gardens grow nearby; these,
too, seem unattended, but are always neat.

What is this house and who is the gardener?
























The house is the past, and God is the gardener.

I'm not sure. Perhaps you could get some more information by contacting Gwen Albert, editor of  the journal_ Jejune: america eats its young_. (P.O. Box 85, 110 01 Praha 1, Czech Republic). She is an American poet /writer /editor living in Prague. Maybe she could be helpful? The interview published in Left Curve no.22 (info below) indicates she has knows something about the poetries of Czech Republic and Slovakia.

*******

FYI to those subscribing to Poetics List:

In _ LEFT CURVE no.22_  printed version

 [the Website is current only thru issue no.21 http://www.wco.com/~leftcurv   ]

 there is an interview conducted 10/29/97 by Gwen Albert , talking to Paul Polansky and Czech Romany activist Lubomir Zubak. Both have been collecting the oral histories of Romany (Gypsy) survivors of the WWII era Czech -run  Lety concentration camp. The Contributor's notes mentions that Polanksy is an American poet living in Prague. A book of his poems,_ Living through It Twice, Poems of the Romany Holocaust (1940-19997)_ has just been published in Prague, as has an oral history of Romany Czech survivors,_ Black Silence_.

" Polansky has continued to live with Romany families in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Polanksy mentions that racial attacks by skinheads against the Romany population has amounted to over 1,200 in 1998 to bring the issue to a current statys. Polansky and Zubak continue to denounce two surviving guards from the camp for war crimes, and insist that the memorial unveiled at Lety in 1995---, which largely exists because of the publicity brought about by Polansky's researches (the article claims)----is not in accordance with the Helsinki  Accords. Among the deficiencies are the fact that a pig farm which was built on the site has yet to be removed, the monument is not adequately marked and there is no easy access from the highway."

FYI about Slovene poetry ( NOT Slovak poetry):


Not to confuse the request for as yet untranslated Slovak poetry, there is also an interesting section on 20th century  Slovene poetry  in Left Curve No. 22, with an introductory essay by Boris A. Novak. ".( Initially, I suppose, I confused Slovak with Slovene , until I came across this article).


(from the Contributor's Notes)
<<The Slovenian poems included in this issue were sent to us by the SLOVENE WRITERS' ASSOCIATION and selected from the magazine "VILENICA DESETNICA" (1986-1995) and from unpublished manuscripts.>>

Address listed:

SLOVENE WRITER'S ASSOCIATION
61000 Ljubljana
Tomsicva 12
SLOVENIA

(note the diacritic V goes above the 's' and 'c' in Tomsicya, , called a 'hacek' in my Webster's 9th and can't be reproduced from my keyboard.)

Part 1 of Boris Novak Introduction is called "The Slovene dual-aspect: an untranslatable form". Which reads:

"The Slovene language is one of the rare modern languages to have a retained the dual-aspect, an archaic grammatical form : in Slovene, this special form---midway between singular and plural---is used to refer to two things or to two people. For example, at the verbal level:

I speak / am speaking~~~~~> govorim

We speak / are speaking ~~~>govorimo
   (3 people or more)

We (two) are speaking~~~~~>govoriva


The same goes for nouns,eg. :

A (one) book~~~~~~~> knjiga

(the) books : ~~~~~~~> knjige
  (3 or more)

two books~~~~~~~~~> knigi


[….The dual is the language of love, an isle of intimacy. Lying between two deserts---the silence of solitude, marked by the singular form, and the voice of the masses, represented by the plural---there is a whispering oasis which flourishes in our language. Here, two solitudes create a fragile link speaking to each other in a low voice, protected by the very syntax of the Slovene language. When one translates Slovene poetry in which the dual form is use, one loses the atmosphere of intimacy which is granted us by the very structure of our language. More than any other dimensions of our culture, it is the dual form which symbolizes the soul of the slovene people. Indeed, we often say jokingly that Slovenia is so small that already two people together form a quantity which cannot be neglected….]






Here's a sample from the poems published:


Veno Taufer (b. 1933)

PERHAPS THE JUNIPER NEEDLES


this pain is not to be survived
the luminous rain
which cries through the airless space


unless beyond the monotony of sound
through its fissures there is
that dust perhaps that pollen


which no spider web can catch
nor even the darkness of memory
just this no more after that come the words the voices


the wizard letters the runefrost
perhaps the juniper needles
perhaps the unsurvivably sweet motion of a blade of grass


moving to the white breath of the fleet dragon
before the maw that space vanishing along teeth into a darkness
blue beyond the azure of candles


now the drops the drops just this
what kind how long
how many drops


what are the limits
as memory curves
in upon itself ?

(translated by Milne Holton)

*****


Milan Dekleva (b.1946)

ORIGIN OF LANGUAGE



Women talk the jargon of shattered flowerbeds
The sick talk from pain
Stones from stoniness
The stars mumble the gravitation of light.
To the prophet and illusionist the voice lends revelations.
The meadows are littered with alphabets of ants,
the cantilena of towns is a criss-cross of errands.


Only freedom speaks the pathos of its own being ,
which is freedom.
That speech is on the boundary.
It convenes the whole world
at the human ear.
Encircles us, as death encircles life.
Like wide-open doors we flap in time ,
the hundred times safeguarded secret
of worthlessness.

(translated by Alasdair MacKinnon)


*****

Iztok O'sojnik (b.1951)


A TRAM NAMED GRINZING



They killed Conrad in the first war.
I have seen two.
I had many men. The times
were such . Conrad
I remember well.
For a long time I crushed the heart
of a celebrated poet. Let's not mention names!
Whereas now I can't even see
the damned umbrella
I placed
right here , in front , on the floor of the tram.
We've just stopped
at the Siveringstrasse
The next stop's mine.

(translated by Mia Dintinjana)

Ron,
Hank's article was one of the few in the Nation. It is very difficult to
accommodate art and the left. All the years of working with the
relationship between Marx and poetry has not done much to erase the basic
Platonic objections or the indelible association between money/power and
art in the minds of left leaders who are more concerned with helping
people to acquire the basics than with adorning the page. There has been
little successful appeal to the value of using non-lexical technique as
political tool, although it is done daily with a kind of blindness that is
hard to accept in those talented people who see social justice as an
important value to achieve.

Gander's review will be a good step, and I can't wait to see it.
The Yasusada book has successfully broached the issue of essentialism, but
most of the detractors do not want to approach the real concern and dwell
inevitably on the offense. It will be interesting the see the response. As
I remember Hank's article was followed by an attack by an in-house Nation
author and Hank was given no chance to reply. I hope we will not have a
repeat of such a breach of fairness.

There is something beautiful offering me space. Whenever I enter it, room
is made for me. Yet as soon as I leave, the space is immediately occupied
by others, and if I enter it again, I will never find the same. What is
it?

I have to know--this could, after all, be important: did you find his
symbolism blatant, overt, calculated, subtle, inspired? The "turn on your

"easy wind 'cross the bayou today."

"Now let us see what these numbers mean in terms of a ballistic
trajectory, which is the basic element needed to make a firing or
bombing table. Such a calculation is a way of determining via Newton's
Laws of Motion the shape and path taken by a shell, as a FUNCTION OF
TIME, as it moves from the gun to some point, say on the ground. Of
course, as the angle of elevation or muzzle velocity is changed this
path will change. A typical trajectory or path required the order of 750
multiplications, and took a differential analyzer anywhere from 10 to 20
minutes to calculate it with a precision of about five parts per 10,000,
which was about the utmost in accuracy attainable by such a machine....
The human cum desk calculator (10 seconds per multiplication) would then
spend about 2 hours on the multiplying; and, with our estimate of a
factor of six, about 12 hours doing an individual trajectory....The
Harvard-IBM machine (3 seconds) required about 2 hours; the Bell machine
(1 second), about 2/3 hour; and the mark II (0.4 seconds) about 1/4
hour. The differential analyzer took...about 10-20 minutes."---from The
Computer from Pascal to von Neumann by Herman H. Goldstine
---
"As to time, which, it is to be presumed, would, by way of the
counterpart to space, constitute the object-matter of the other division
of pure mathematics, this is the notion itself in the form of existence.
The principle of quantity, of difference which is not determined by the
notion, and the principle of equality, of abstract, lifeless unity, are
incapable of dealing with that sheer restlessness of life and its
absolute inherent process of differentiation. It is therefore ONLY IN AN
ARRESTED AND PARALYSED FORM, ONLY IN THE FORM OF THE QUANTITATIVE UNIT,
that this ESSENTIALLY NEGATIVE ACTIVITY becomes the object-matter of
this way of knowing, which, itself an EXTERNAL OPERATION, degrades what
is self-moving to the level of mere matter, in order thus to get an
indifferent, external, lifeless content."---from the Phenomenology of
Mind by G.W.F. Hegel---cp

Now it can be calculated as soon as the target is identified and in range,
and recalculated in terms of the delivery system's motion until the trigger
is pulled, and recalculated in terms of the projectiles own course - with
course corrections - right to target.

It simply has to be unthinkably "too fast", in order to be effective.

When we consider the velocity of some modern day projectiles, we realize how
unthinkably fast too fast really is. Accurate prediction is best before the
fact. The effort of science and technology is to predict as accurately as
possible, and as long before the event as possible, any event that could
actually occur. That is fundamental to the siezing of power over events, and
particularly against such events that might threaten human survival.

Hegel is often very silly. (A lot of Hegel is religion in a new guise, and
that gives rise to the religion of Marxism. No surprise as Karl Marx
created, by derivation, a political-economic system, mostly derived from
Hegel and the Bible, interpreted in terms of the conservative wing of German
Protestantism.
Of course, Marx deified the state, transferring the characteristics of the
right wing Protestant "god" to the central organ of the political body. Marx
would then prove correct, as to political evolution becoming that
deification of the state, should Tipler prove correct as to the nature of
the Omega-Point. The two ideas go hand in hand, and Tipler then would become
shepherded into the marxist flock as one of its prophets of central state
totalism. In fact, read Hegel's "Phenomenology of Spirit" from a Tiplerian
viewpoint. I dare you to. At the very least you will see how Tipler and
Hegel join the Marx Brothers.)

Time and space, being dimensions, have no existence per se, but exist only
as the relativity of other material events, as the relativity of those
events to each other. Time is not an object, but there must be existing
objects or there is no relation among them, to each other, such that we can
refer to as being durational. Those relations are defined by the intrinsic
properties of objects, as determine their interactions and their individual
existences. Location in space-time dimensions is at once considered
characteristic of an existent and also considered as being determined by the
characteristics of an existent.

The fact that physics has to deal with anomalies where the space-time paths
of events are observably interrupted, becoming non local as to 4 dimensional
space-time, vanishing to mythematical "infinity" and then sometimes
reappearing at another space-time location, leads to the addition of a fifth
dimension to the 4 dimensions of Einsteinian space-time. That becomes a
pardigm shift, that is yet to be fully realized and defined.

Juliana,

Thanks for this intelligent report on an important issue. It ties in to a
lot of recent discussion here I think. My question is: was the panel and
forum held in order to discuss rescinding the award, or some other kind of
action to be taken?

Also, I wonder about your disclaimer: what is a "mainland haole," why does
the disclaimer have a ring of "I am not worthy" in it, and whose
authorization of the report would have been desirable?

Despite her "disclaimer," Juliana's post on this topic was truly
fascinating, informative, and politico-socially very astute.

Somewhat off her main topic (but very close to some primary interests of
mine, and surely of the List's)---

i am mesmerized by the following:

" Is the unreliable narrator a flawed concept?
One built on elitist reading practices?"

Er, if the unreliable narrator is built on elitist reading practices, then
the work of most folks on the list is in deep trouble.  Because the good
ol' U.N. is sure a minor wrinkle compared to the best, most interesting
and compelling writing out there right now...Especially that which goes
broadly under the rubric, "poetry."

A very pertinent example: the complex tones and voices of Juliana's own
beguiling volume, Response.

Hope this is still useful information, I wasn't able to telnet into e-mail
often while I was out of town.

Most of these things aren't manifestos or academic criticism as such, but try

Gregory Battcock's anthology of essays "Art of Performance";
Jill Johnston had some books that collected her Village Voice dance reviews
& essays from the 60s & 70s;
Deborah Jowitt who subsequently wrote about dance after Johnston stopped
also has some collections;
there's a book of interviews with Merce Cunningham that I think is called
Dancer & the Dance;
Sally Banes has a couple of books that should be useful - one on Judson
Church & a couple more general ones;
Cindy Carr's On Edge is more about performance art but I think there's a
few dance things in it;

Can't think of any more, but some of these should also have pointers to
other sources.

Bests,

Herb

A comment about the Association for Asian American Studies conference and
Yamanaka.  After the debate that Juliana described, the association went to a
Luau.  i went and read poetry with Epi Enari, a local samoan woman.  A friend
of epi's showed up at the reading and he was from Somoa but now lived in La
and had just given a paper at the AAA conference.  When asked why he wasn't at
the Luau, he said "Are you kidding? They would expect me serve them."  That
comment made me think that on a large structural/allegorical level, the whole
Yamanaka debate seemed to be about whether or not the association was going to
"allow" filipinos to be asian. The next night i was out with a local Korean-
american  friend and i tested my theory by asking him the question:  Are
Filipinos Asian?  He said jokingly,  "well kinda. I guess we'll let them in."

Subject: protest of award for Yamanaka

I went to a meeting by the Association for Asian American Studies
yesterday. The Association has awarded Lois-Ann Yamanaka's _Blu's
Hanging_ an award. Many members of the Association have protested the
award, arguing that the book presents racist representations of
Filipino/as. In Hawai'i there is a stereotype that Filipinos are
sexually deviant (partial to incest, rape, child molestation). In _Blu's
Hanging_, a family of Japanese-Americans live next to a family of
Filipino-Americas. Members of the Filipino family commit various acts of
incest, rape, and child molestation.

The Association had a panel on this topic which I missed. And they also
held a roundtable forum on the issue which I attended. Apparently the
Association had for years been considering Yamanaka's books for the
award starting with _Saturday Night at the Pahala Theatre_ and
continuing with _Wild Meat and Bully Burgers_ but had never given her
the award. Each year there had been protest of some sort from the
membership. It was noted several times that of all these books, _Blu's
Hanging_ is the most problematic in terms of race. So to award the award
to this book has been seen as particularly insensitive.

At the roundtable many people spoke. The argument seemed to be split
around two sides. One side argued mainly that this was a freedom of
speech issue (which it really isn't; no one is suggesting the book by
banned, just that it not be rewarded). This side was represented by a
number of local writers who are not academics and by a number of
established Asian-American writers, also mainly not academics, from the
mainland. Statements were read by people like Amy Tan, Maxine Hong
Kingston, David Mura, etc. Wing Tek Lu, from Bamboo Ridge who publishes
_Saturday Night at the Pahala Theatre_, had a thick petition and
collection of statements in support of Yamanaka. Unfortunately there
were only copies for the roundtable participants so I didn't get to see
one. The other side was represented by a number of mainly local
academics. Many spoke movingly of the difficulties of growing up
Filipino/a in Hawai'i.

The roundtable felt caught between these two positions, neither
addressing the other. But for more information I would suggest looking
at the work of Candace Fujikane. She has a good article in the most
recent volume of _Social Processes in Hawai'i_ (1998, UH Press) on this
issue. She also posted a moving and complicated statement to the
Association's discussion list. Walter Lew forwarded it to me. I'm sure
he would do the same for you if you asked (or I could also).

At the conference, I was talking to Dorothy Wong and she told me how
many people at the conference had said that the protest was a Hawai'i
issue. I have to agree (which doesn't make it less important). When I
read _Saturday Night_ on the mainland it seemed clear that the poems are
told by an unreliable teenage narrator and the first poem, "Kala Gave Me
Any Kine Advice Especially about Filipinos when I Moved to Pahala," can
be read as a critique of racist stereotypes. But when I've taught the
book here, the first thing students often say is, here is a voice that
is my voice, which I've never heard taken seriously before. (It is an
amazing experience to teach this book here. Students really feel like it
changes their life and validates whole parts of their culture that have
been degraded.) And then the problem starts b/c this voice is the voice
of a teenage racist.

Also, it is crucial to realize that being Japanese-American in Hawai'i
(which Yamanaka is) is similar to being haole in terms of economic and
social power. (Race discussions repeatedly define class discussions.)
Whereas Filipino/as possess significantly less economic and social
power. It is often said that because Yamanaka writes coming of age
stories of planatation life that she is unwillingly to abandon the
rhetoric of marginalization and take responsibility for
Japanese-American complicity in the colonial (neocolonial?) power
structure. Her characters will grow up to set much of Hawai'i's policy.
What then?

To add to the problem, Yamanaka is reported as saying things like her
book is "true" and that she has known Filipinos like that and how she is
just reporting what she has seen.

I wished for more analysis of the book at the roundtable. One of the
ways that I have a lot of respect for Yamanaka's work is that she has
addressed the language issue in a way that a lot of writers here have
avoided it. Many local writers go through the creative writing program
at Univ of Hawai'i, Manoa which likes nature poetry and MFA short story
forms (some important exceptions: Morgan Blair, Susan Schultz, Rob
Wilson). Yamanaka's writing in pidgin puts forth a critique of these
forms that rivals the critique of American presence in the land that is
a part of the literature of Hawai'i.

I wished also for more discussion of what we do with a teenage racist
narrator. Fujikane repeatedly points out how important it is to avoid
saying that those who do not read this book as told by an unreliable
narrator are unsophisticated. I agree with her. But when do we stop or
start to read that narrator as unreliable (again, Fujikane has a good
point that in _Blu's Hanging_, the narrator sees the sexual abuse, she
doesn't just report it)? Is the unreliable narrator a flawed concept?
One built on elitist reading practices?

A vote is being held by the Association on this issue today. I'm not
sure what the outcome will be. The room felt very divided.

It was great to see many people who were not academics speaking up on
this issue. It is evidence that what one writes does matter, can carry
huge consequences to a community.

Disclaimer: please realize that since I am a mainland haole who has
lived here for less than a year that this report is not authorized.
Please supplement with other points of view (the Association discussion
might be a good place to start).

A wonderful summer's reading for ReMap #6
this sunday under the tree in Diane Ward's backyard.
Marty Nakell read work by Susan Roberts
Noah De Lissovoy read work by Laura Moriarity
I read the "sightings" pages from issues 1-6
Diane Ward read an Imaginary Lyric by A. Shurin.
It occured and
we were there. Hopefully Issue #7 (ON LOVE)
won't be long in coming.
The idea Carolyn Kemp and I continue to
persue and persue is one of
dialogue. The idea to have, at this reading, poets read Others work,
(other than their own) engaged in an instant fashion
the notion.

Can anyone suggest a goodbook that's an overview ("   ") of Russian
History--?

One area I will be teaching come Sept to my Middle Schhol class is
Russia--along with work by Gogol, Tolstoy, Doestoevsky, Ahkmatova, etc.
But I need more insight into the vastness of Russian history--and--I'm
afraid--haven't the time to do real elongated readings..

thanks much,

Subject:      Jerome Sala and Poetry Slams
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Some of you on this list may know Jerome Sala, a poet from Chicago who has
been living in New York for awhile now. An article about poetry slams
appeared in The New York Times on June 16, some of which is quoted below:

>From NY TIMES 6/16/98, pp. E1 & E9:

"The organizers of the Taos championship bout are at great pains to
distinguish their event from slam poetry, a phenomenon that took root in
Chicago in the mid-1980s and now has its own annual national championship
event...Nonetheless, slams and bouts are obviously cut from similar cloth.

Both involve competitive readings with judges providing numerical scores
and crowds going beserk.  Rules vary from slam to slam.  But the primary
difference is that a slam usually involves several entrants or individuals,
who may or may not be accomplished poets, while a bout is two poets,
usually of some reputation, going head to head.

A further confusion is that the championship bout was also born in Chicago,
at a bar on Lincoln Avenue called to Oxford Pub in 1981.  There, a blues
singer named Jim Desmond became angered when a poet named Jerome Sala read
a poem that parodied John Lennon, who had just died.  They got into a
fight, eventually agreeing to settle the dispute with a competitive
reading.  They asked the bartender, Al Simmons, to arrange it, which he
did, with the cooperation of a friend, Terry Jacobus.  Mr. Sala won the
first bout, as well as a rematch."

Jerome Sala is the author of Raw Deal: New and Selected Poems 1980-1994
(Another Chicago Press). The following blurb by me, excerpted from an
introduction to a reading I invited Jerome to give at the Ear Inn in
1992,appears on the back cover:
"Jerome Sala's poems...embody  subliminal philosphical messages which,
instead of stroking our foolishly cherished stereotypes disassemble them
secretly, and, before you know it, blow away their remains..."

Sadly you would find good sources that cover events only up to the time of
the Bolshevik Revolution, and mostly either written before the Revolution in
Russian and shipped abroad, or written by foreigners from a foreign
viewpoint. Soviet versions of pre-Bolshevik history would be useless, except
for a study of totalist propaganda.

After the revolution you find only propaganda and disinformation on both
sides, Soviet and foreign. Even the departments of Soviet studies got few
things right about Soviet realities. That was subsequently proven, to the
astonishment of those who were playing follow the academic leader within
that discipline.

Sadly the KGB and the NKVD destroyed MOST of the historical resources and
documents as to anything between the time of the revolution and the
disintegration of the Soviet empire. There is what remains of the KGB
archives, but it would be extremely tedious to go through any of that, and
there are far too few good historians who know Russian and understand the
Soviet machine well enough, to be able to piece anything together that has
any reasonable credibility. The Soviet Union was a state that essentially,
effectively, wiped out its own history.

So you begin from there.

Pre-Soviet Russian history should be accessible in a vast number of credible
English, French and German sources.

Slams have always struck me as thinly veiled Public Relations
events held to "showcase" various "personalities" who are looking for a
spot in a beer commercial.

Admittedly, though, this impression may have to do more with the
particularly unimaginative neo-beat "spoken-word" poets here in Vancouver
than with the slam itself.

1.Reduction
A DOCTRINE to which most philosophers of science subscribe (and to which
I subscribed for many years) is the doctrine that the laws of such
"higher level" sciences like psychology and sociology are reducible to
the laws of the lower-level sciences--biology, chemistry, ultimately to
the laws of elementary particle physics. Acceptance of the doctrine is
generally identified with belief in "The Unity of Science" (with
capitals), and rejection of it with belief in vitalism, or psychism, or,
anyway, something bad.
In this paper I want to argue that this doctrine is wrong....
I shall begin with a logical point and then apply it to the special case
of psychology. The logical point is that from the fact that the behavior
of a system can be deduced from its description as a system of
elementary particles, it does not follow that it can be explained from
that description...."---Reductionism and the Nature of Psychology by

I'm afraid that Morpheal is right on this one; much of the
material on Soviet Russia is fraught with inaccuracy. Often,
you need some of the same critical skills that you employ
when you read the fiction.

I'm not sure if I'm right when I take Middle School to mean
ages 9 to 12; it seems quite a lot to dump on them all at
once. But I suppose you know what you're doing. Are you going
any further back than the writers you list? Damn, I'm a fan
of Turgenev; and, while I did not receive as full an education
in the use of stanza as I might have liked from Pushkin, E.O.
is wonderful. Especially the racy bits about women's ankles.

Middle school! Sorry. The following is rated G.

There's an excellent book called _The Making of Modern Russia_,
published 1990 or so; I forget the author, but there's only
one that fits the description in amazon.com; try the library.
It covers pretty much everything (Ice age to Yeltsin), with
interesting detours and (importantly, maybe for Middle Schoolers?)
also manages to teach a lot about how "History" is done, or told.
Sidenotes such as "it is often noted that a civilization cannot
sustain itself as such until a grain of wheat multiplies itself
seven times"; a "real" historian would take that with a grain
of salt, but for a student, it's a neat way to look at history.
(Go, Marx.) Written by a public-school Britisher, so be a little
careful.

I'm not sure what Dostoyevsky you're looking at, but his realism
often makes itself amenable to historical analysis. St. Petersberg
in C&P, for example. Tolstoy also, but not a very good one (you
spend most of your time thinking Moscow is one damn ballroom, with
a farm in the back.) And, if you really want to make them weep,
Andre Bely's _Petersberg_ (about the events of 1905; written like a
slightly more under control _Ulysses_) will blow you away.

Anybody up for a thread on the Russian Modernists, speaking of? The
Perloff finally arrived here, and I've been eagerly digging through,
letting the work collect dust and bugs. An (apparently) fascinating
article on the connections between Yeats' automatic writing and
theoastrometrology (?) and Khlebnikov's numerology, two subjects that
I've studied separately, but never thought to examine together.

The Streets as Muse to a Peripatetic Poet

          (June 26, NYTimes)



          By RON PADGETT

              When the bus came over that final hill in New Jersey,
              I got my first real-life glimpse of Manhattan
          stretched out broadside like a futuristic battleship 11
          miles long, and the surge of excitement I felt at that
          moment 38 years ago has never quite left me.

          Of course, everything looks good from a distance. And
          when I reached my destination, the Village, I was met
          with a Whelan's drugstore and a Howard Johnson's, at
          Sixth Avenue and Eighth Street: not all that different
          from a busy intersection in Tulsa, where I had just come
          from. Where were the thatched cottages that my fanciful
          18-year-old mind had imagined?

          My roller-coaster reactions were immediately propelled
          by the pace of the streets of Manhattan, not to mention
          the thrill of jaywalking. Soon, as Jack Kerouac put it,
          "I did everything with that great mad joy you get when
          you return to New York City." The sheer energy of the
          streets was irresistible, a force that made me want to
          go to the Museum of Modern Art, the Bleecker Street
          Cinema, the Eighth Street Bookstore, Wall Street at
          midnight and a thousand other places, all at the same
          time, and then go back to my room and write a poem.

          Over the years, I've lost a step, but I still have to
          contain my excitement when I go out into the street,
          because I know that out there I will encounter an
          endless stream of little dramas. Every person who walks
          toward me, becoming not only larger and larger but
          giving an evolving impression, will bring his or her own
          personal drama that climaxes as we pass by each other.
          Will that pretty woman's eyes meet mine in some
          mysterious communication? It's fun to fall in love for
          only 10 seconds. And what better place to do so than in
          the streets of New York? But there's the other drama,
          too: Is that guy staggering toward me because he's
          drunk, and what's that in his hand? A baseball bat? And
          he's wearing a Nixon mask. I go back to my apartment and
          write a poem about lunacy (mine).

          But even if -- and especially when -- the streets are
          deserted, there are the buildings. If I lift my gaze, I
          will see a curious architectural detail that I never
          noticed, even though I have walked past it thousands of
          times. For years, the Chrysler Building sparkled and
          radiated behind my poems, but for the last 10 years, I
          have been entranced by the top of the Con Ed building,
          illuminated in subtle colors at night by some genius of
          lighting so that it resembles a flying chunk of ancient
          Babylonia.

          For a few years, the demolition of Klein's department
          store afforded a magnificent view from Union Square of
          the entire height of the Con Ed tower, especially in the
          early evening. But now the sightlines are blocked by a
          new and self-important structure that makes me grit my
          teeth. It's like a piece of cardboard nailed over a
          Vermeer. I got so hot under the collar over this that I
          wrote a prose poem about the joys of anger.

          The gutsy verve of New York's streets is echoed by other
          poets who have lived in the city. I get a thrill when I
          read Walt Whitman's "I too walk'd the streets of
          Manhattan" and his account of walking along 14th Street.
          It's a special pleasure to read his big poem "Crossing
          Brooklyn Ferry" while taking the, well, Staten Island
          Ferry. I feel that I belong in New York when I read
          Edwin Denby's powerful sonnets about West 21st Street,
          Sixth Avenue and the old IND subway line, as well as his
          hallucinatory "Elegy -- The Streets."

          I get a tingly feeling every time I look up at Furnald
          Hall, a dormitory on the Columbia campus, because I know
          that the great Spanish poet Federico García Lorca, the
          author of "Poet in New York," once lived behind one of
          its windows. I never pass by Rockefeller Center without
          thinking of a poem about Christmas in New York, James
          Schuyler's heartbreakingly beautiful "December," with
          its funny opening, "The giant Norway spruce from Podunk
          . . ."

          But for my money, the poet who gets the most out of New
          York is Frank O'Hara, whose "A Step Away From Them"
          includes the dirty glistening torsos of construction
          laborers, Coca-Cola, pet shop windows, an electric
          waterfall, giant smoke rings, a blond chorus girl, a
          toothpick, a quotation from Denby, a cheeseburger, three
          of Frank's departed friends, a glass of papaya juice, a
          book by the French poet Pierre Reverdy and more. In his
          relatively short poem, O'Hara gives us all of Times
          Square in the late 1950's. It still makes me like Times
          Square, just as Ted Berrigan's poem about "reeling up
          First Avenue to Klein's" makes me happy to reel up First
          Avenue, too, especially the block between 11th and 12th
          Streets, whose deep red tenement facades sometimes take
          on a supernatural glow at sundown.

          And First Avenue will always remind me of bumping into
          Allen Ginsberg, whose poetry was one of the reasons I
          came to New York in the first place, at Shin's fruit
          stand late one night. He held up a tomato and said,
          "Ron, at 79 cents a pound, this is a very good deal."

          Where else in the world can all this happen? Is this not
          a poet's paradise?

Dear Scott Keeney,

In response to your call to Poetics for poetry for The End Review, I
send along seven poems.  Excepted from a cycle of poems that arise from
history's caesura's: the way history both records and fails to record -
attending to what is lost in the process.  The titles of the poems are:
Dreamwork, Centennial Cemetary Pretty Woman (II), Treaty, No Name Woman,
(No Name Woman (II), and Lunar Variations.

I can be reached by email at reed@boneyard.psy.uwa.eud.au.  I look
forward to hearing from you.  Please let me know if you have any
problems reading this file.

Actually, "Slam" was indeed born in Chicago, but not by Jerome Sala.
For what it's worth, Marc Smith is generally credited with fathering what
is now called "slam" poetry, and it was started as an attempt to get the
audiences involved to some degree in the readings which were at times
stodgy and uncomfortable for the poet.

Unfortunately, "Slam" has become a multi-headed beast, and very little of
what can be heard at a Slam fits even the loosest definitions of poetry, at
least until you get it on a national level.

Poets who border on Slam:  Jimmy Bacca, Sou MacMillan, Patricia Smith, Marc
Smith, etc.

Also, Bob Holman in NYC can shed a great deal of insight on this "school"
of poetics if he is still a list subscriber...

   Ah, 7/4/70--I remember it well. Little kid with crew cut (against

if i recall, the "standard" history is riasanovsky, listed below.  it's
what we used for our russian history course back in university days.  tho
it goes through stalin and into khruschev i believe, probably,
alas, does not address the issues that morpheal and others raise.

My university library currently houses 3 recent volumes of that
dreck.  I'm going to forward the address to the acquisitions dept.
and ask them to stop supporting them.

Just for a giggle, here's the anthology titles:
Isle of View -- '97
Through the Hourglass -- '96
Windows of the Soul -- '95

thanks, David Baratier, for bringing that webpage to my attention.

Since I posted Tim's report of appearing before the Supreme Court, thought
I'd follow through with his response to the decision.  To me it's
interesting how little his response has to do with Art as opposed to being
Queer.  Okay, let's be honest, I'm not thinking "interesting," I'm thinking
"narrow-minded."  Not that gay rights aren't important, but the ruling
affects *everybody* who's doing sexually explicit material--and any arts
org that hosts those doing sexually-explicit material.  And his clothespins
on testicles . . . didn't straight guy Bob Flannagan already do that?

----------------------

A SUPREME DRAG by Tim Miller

While I was performing last week in Texas (the Steers and Queer State) at
Theater Lab Houston, I had to pause for a tiny moment as the naked,
clothespins-on-nipples climax of my show moved through me. I realized that at
that exact moment industrious little District of Columbia elves were probably
proofing, collating, and stapling copies of the Supreme Court decision on
whether "general standards of decency" were constitutional criterion as
applied to federal funding of the arts. This was truly going to be the last
roundup of the NEA 4 case.
In 1990, I, a wandering queer performance artist, had been awarded a NEA Solo
Performer Fellowship, which was promptly overturned under political pressure
from the Bush White House because of the lush, wall-to-wall homo themes of my
creative work. We so-called "NEA 4" (me, Karen Finley, John Fleck and Holly
Hughes), then successfully sued the federal government with the help of the
ACLU (if you're not a card-carrying member, become one!) for violation of our
First Amendment rights and won a settlement where the government paid us the
amount of the defunded grants and all court costs. The last little driblet of
this case was the "decency" clause, which Congress had added to the NEA
appropriation under the cattle prod of Jesse Helms. Judge Wallace Tashima of
the Ninth Federal Circuit Curt had sagely declared this "decency" clause
unconstitutional from the bench and thrown it out.
This could have been our happy ending, except for our supposed friend Bill
Clinton (with friends like these who needs anal herpes?) who allowed the
Justice Department to appeal this decision to the high court. Now we were
going to have be subjected to the Supremes decision. "Which way are the
feathers going to fly?"  I  pondered as I gave my all for the lovely audience
in Houston last week in a humorous and sexy bit from the show based on my book
Shirts & Skin. Shifting a clothespin from my right testicle to the left to
"balance the energy", I wondered whether the Supreme Court was going to
rightly determine that "general standards of decency" is very vague and
designed to keep queer art out of the federal feedbag. (I know I'm over-
working these cow and horse metaphors, but it works for the Texas setting of
the performance, doesn't it?)
What could be indecent about me anyhow? Is the fact that I am outspokenly a
gay man indecent? Is the fact that my performance work lovingly details my
experiences growing up queer in this fucked-up society indecent? Is the fact
that I explore the rich terrain of sexuality, so full of feeling and
discovery, indecent? Is the fact that I take off my clothes in my shows and
try to acknowledge that our bodies actually exist under our clothes indecent?
As I finished my show, full of all the complexity, memory and metaphor that
naked queer flesh is heir to, I knew that it was just a matter of days before
I would find out whether my indecent ass was grass. Let's face it, there in
the Lone Star State, as it was in one third of these United States, it was
still against the law to have queer sex! How much could I rationally expect
from any governmental body in our troubled country?
Well, if you read your newspaper not long ago, you'll know that the Supremes
decided that it was okey-dokey not to fund "indecent art". The law "neither
inherently interferes with First Amendment rights nor violates constitutional
vagueness principles,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in her majority
opinion. In a disappointing 8-1 decision the high court hitched up with Helms
and his ilk and said the National Endowment for the Arts can consider
"decency" in deciding who gets public money for the arts. I was grateful that
at least Justice David H. Souter showed he was sensible to the reality of how
under assault artists have been in this country for the last ten years. He was
the lone Justice who dissented, saying the law should be struck down as
unconstitutional because it was "substantially overbroad and carries with it a
significant power to chill artistic production and display.''
I wasn't surprised when I heard the decision upon my return to my home in Los
Angeles. This was, after all, the same Supreme Court, if not the same white
men in black robes, that had ruled in the 1857 Dred Scott decision that
African-Americans could not come before the high court because they were not
human beings or citizens. This was also the same court that decided in Bowers
v. Hardwick in 1986 that it was constitutionally cool for the State of Georgia
to have laws that make it illegal for gay people to have sex with one another
in the privacy of their bedrooms! Understandably, I had low expectations all
along that queer artists would be allowed our fair share at the Federal
feedbag (that's the last cowboy reference, I promise!).
Though it didn't really surprise me, part of me was still shocked when I heard
their decision early in the morning on June 25. Can the justices not
understand how censorious this language is? How often seemingly bland words
like "decency" or "normal" or "natural" have been used to discriminate against
lesbians and gay men and as weapons against us?
I spent the day of the announcement doing dozens of interviews, spinning away
the soundbites like the good gay artist/activist that I am supposed to be. I
was available to whoever called - the New York Times, The Los Angles Times,
the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Philadelphia Inquirer, and my
Mom! But late in the day it started to really hit me. The Supreme Court, the
big daddy court in the land, thinks it's okay not to support artists whose
voice and vision is outside the middle-of-the-suburban-mall sensibility of
some fantasy America. Yikes!
I became very depressed. So depressed, I had to resort to two pints of Ben &
Jerry's Cherry Garcia and a half-hour with an Eastern European gay porn movie.
Then I became very pissed-off.
Okay, Mr. & Ms. Supreme Court, the gloves are off. It's no more Mr. Nice Gay
Guy! I am not going to be satisfied with small potatoes anymore. You could
have gotten off easy with tossing a tidbit my way and allowing this queer
artist the illusion that I am an equal citizen and worthy of support from the
NEA should it be awarded. The truth is I didn't have a snowball's chance in a
Houston heatwave to ever get support from the NEA again regardless of what
decision the Supreme Court had made. So I am going to up the ante of what I
expect from the US government. I now want the whole ball of wax, the cart and
the horses, my cake and the eating too!
You see, I've got a little list.
 I'm not going to be content anymore with the odd NEA grant that used to get
tossed to gay film festivals and queer performance artists. I want the full
measure of my rights as a gay American citizen. I want it now!
I want the Employee Non-Discrimination Act passed by Congress yesterday. I'm
sick of this shit that lesbians and gay men can be fired without recourse from
their jobs, fired just because of who they are!
And while we're at it, repeal all the damn sodomy laws in those last medieval
states that still have them on the books. These bigoted statutes make the US
an outlaw nation that could not participate in the economic community of
European nations without striking them all down. Not only does this country
censor our queer art, but they also make laws against our queer bodies! Cut it
out, now!
I want the government to put at its highest priority the creation of safe
streets for lesbians and gay men. Why is it that I have to find it not
surprising that two of the men I have been in major relationships with have
almost been killed in gay-bashing incidents? Fix it quick or I'm going to get
cranky!
I want the anti-gay military shit to stop right now! I'm over it! Hey, you
generals, don't ask me, don't tell me anything! Get off your five-star dildo
and make the military safe for the dykes and fags that want to be there and
are not bothering anybody. (You won't find me in uniform, but that doesn't
matter). Leave the queers alone and, instead, why don't you pick on the white
supremacists the military seems to breed who end up exploding buildings and
killing black folks!
I want immigration rights for lesbian and gay men pronto! This is real
personal because my boyfriend Alistair is from Australia. Our relationship is
denied the rights that every heterosexual person has in this country to be
able to turn their lover into a US citizen. It's like straight people are
given this magic wand, "Poof, my love, you're a citizen! Have a green card!"
Not long ago, I was speaking to the Diversity Council of the University of
Arizona. They were meeting about gay couples and domestic partnership
benefits. I was had been invited to this meeting while I was performing there
in Tucson to give my perspective as someone who is in a bi-national
relationship, which is not recognized by the US government. I started to do my
stump speech "BLAH BLAH!" and then suddenly found myself weeping crazily at
this big public meeting. All at once I actually felt the deep hurt of the fact
that my relationship, this deepest personal place of who I love, is completely
unseen and unvalued by my culture. I felt the terror in my guts that warns me
that when Alistair's student visa runs out he will have to leave this country.
Well, fuck you Judicial, Executive and Legislative bodies of the US
government. Give me immigration rights for our lovers or I am going to get
really unpleasant!
And that reminds me of something else! While I'm on a roll, I want the whole
kit-n-caboodle of full marriage rights too! Now that you've annoyed me, I'm
not going to settle for any second class domestic partnership benefits. I want
full church-sanctioned marriages. Any denomination that denies gay people our
civil right/rite of marriage will lose their tax-deductible status. How 'bout
them apples? One more thing, I want the government to guarantee us the man or
woman of our dreams to marry! (This point is negotiable. I don't want to be
unreasonable).
Well, that is a good start. I'm sure more will occur to me, but I'm on a
deadline. Lovely readers, feel free to add a couple of dozen of your own
demands too!  I don't want this outrage from the Supreme Court to depress me
anymore than it already has. I can't afford too many pints of Ben & Jerry's.
After all, I need to stay on the naked performance artist diet! I would rather
get pissed-off and feisty and look forward to the day when this particular
decision will seem as absurd and embarrassing as Plessy v. Ferguson does to us
today (the 1896 Supreme Court ruling that said it was constitutional to make
black people sit at the back of street cars).
I will look forward to the time (in the not too distant future, I hope), when
a teacher will step before a community college class exploring late twentieth
century social movements and say, "Now, students, I know it is shocking to
believe this, but there was once a time as recent as the late 1990's when
lesbian and gay men were actually denied certain civil rights within our
democratic society. The Supreme Court even upheld a series of laws that
constitutionally discriminated against them!"
Until that day in school, I'm in it for the long haul.

Good idea, since the library could certainly use that money for something
else (like supporting a few lit mags with subscriptions). Then again,
university libraries acquire things for all kinds of reasons, some of which
are political (in the local sense).  It wouldn't surprise me if someone --
a vocal someone -- within the institution had poems included in the
anthology and demanded that the library buy it. I know of one distinguished
faculty member (tenured, Law School) at my own university who was taken in
by the Nat. Lib. of Poetry. He, like many others who don't follow the
poetry world all that closely, thought it was associated with the Library
of Congress, and didn't know it was a vanity scam until I broke the bad
news to him.

some of the other recent titles have been even worse.  wish i had them
handy to show, but i'll say that they wouldn't even qualify as dreck good
enough for hallmark cards.

i wish there were a way to take the name "National Library of Poetry" from
them, they don't seem to be anything besides a commercial vanity press,
much less a national library

On the other hand, Fred, as an acquisitions person who has worked at an
array of different large universities, and several other sorts of
libraries, i believe Linda has a fair shot at having an impact....Often
the acquiring of this sort a' thing is just the collections

acquisitions/collection development people are *extremely* happy to have
input from their user-population, about what should or shouldn't be
acquired....

As i have posted before on the List, people can often have more impact
than they think on the university or public library that they patronize...
And so i strongly encourage everyone to request the purchase of the poetry
they think is important; remember,

"only you can stamp out the mainstream."

I wouldn't be surprised if Fred's case were the case here in the
happy homey heartland valley of heartfelt sentiments & a wonderbread
factory on the "strip."  Maybe they'll ignore me, maybe President
Machen('s daughter more likely) has a poem in the Nat'l library! But
it probably doesn't hurt my case to mention the website, do you think
Mark?  hard evidence.  I wish I actaully knew acquisitions people,
I'd dump a pile of books on their desk. . . As it is I sent them an
email from the Library Web page -- maybe this one will prompt them to
respond with a progress report on my previous requests.

And as a reference librarian at a large research library for the last 17
years, I can say that my experience corroborates yours.  In fact, that's
the point I was trying to make: that it's likely a single individual
requested that the Nat. Lib. of Poetry anthology be acquired in the first
place (though things like this also come in as a gifts now and then). A
vanity publication is unlikely to appear on very many automatic blanket
order profiles a university library might use to streamline the collection
development process.  From what I've seen -- and I send dozens of purchase
requests to collection development every week -- requests for individual
poetry titles or subscriptions to little mags are as a rule taken quite
seriously.  So, yeah, everyone, tell your libraries what you want to see on
their shelves and the chances are good it will end up there.

Slams allow you to go to a poetry reading without having to admit you've been
to a poetry reading.

There are 45 Slams sending teams to the Nationals this year in Austin.

Pinsky had an interesting OpEd piece in Times yesterday. He and Hillary went
to a slamn at a Washington afterschool program and were blown away. The
efficacy of poets like Kenny Carroll and DJ Renegade leads Pinsky to suggest
that MFA poets be allowed to teach poetry in high/middle schools.

Actually, Bob, that's not what Pinsky said. He wants poets with MFAs to
teach in public schools without having to take any education courses.
That's a bit of a leap of faith, and besides, in most jurisdictions the
course requirements for a teaching license are pretty moderate.

It's good, I guess, for our laureate to act as a pr man for poet
employment, altho I suspect that he's being more a shill for the MFA
programs. Otherwise, why the academic prerequisite?

I second, third, fourth, etc. this (Mark Prejsnar's post). As the main
acquisitions person for a small library, simultaneously being a supervisor, a
cataloger, managing basic operations, and fielding reference questions, I delight
in suggestions and requests. Even on our relatively tiny budget, it's rare for us
to ignore requests. Library collections, at least such as this one, exist for the
patrons who use them.

Used to good effect on the Jimmie Spheeris album, circa 1971, of that
title, which I think has just been re-mastered and made available again,
although I'm not certain it's being widely distributed. Old love music, for
whatever reason particularly popular through the southern great plains at
the time.

be allowed to???

what's stopping them?

although I hope he didn't mean students specifically seeking the mfa.
That's a touchy one, fresh to me from recent PTA meetings. Some parents
wanted to get students (undergrad and possibly grad students, instead of
professional artists) to teach as artist residents for short stints in our
child's elementary school, specifically because, as the parent argued, they
didn't require a lot of remuneration, thereby getting "more bang for the
buck." Because I'm involved with artists all the time (either with MFA's,
or with more than the equivalent in terms of life experience in the arts)
who are trying to get such gigs, that one bothered me. But I also think
it's probably insulting to the student artists, and I would make the
argument that we wouldn't want students as the 'regular' or 'primary'
teachers of the children at these schools, so why would we want students as
the arts specialists in these schools. The children deserve the best.

But if  Pinsky is arguing that  MFA faculty ought to teach poetry in
high/middle schools, then I think I like that idea for what it would give
to those faculty members, but I'm not sure I like what it might give to the
students.

maybe poetics list members should teach in high/middle schools?

Fred and the others close to libraries (I deleted mail too quick) bring
up an interesting point for the small press publishers on here. In my
experience with trying to get issues into libraries, even with someone
requesting material, every so often I have run into a panel situation
where I send them a sample copy and the continuing subscription never is
ordered. It only seems to happen at the largest of academic
universities. Is this practice common?

David, being the wealthiest poet in North America, according to your own
admission of the fact, you might know that poets in some parts of North
America DONATE copies of their works, gratis, to those kinds of institutions.

I know of several who are donating, or have donated, their entire archives
as well as having donated copies of all their books.

In fact I think it is becoming an increasingly common practice.

So, this is what I suggest you do: donate to them. They are sure to appreciate.

The panel was held to discuss whether the membership wanted to take away
the award. Apparently on Sunday, or so I've been told, the award was
given and accepted by three of Yamanaka's students (who were Filipina;
I'm not sure if they identified at the acceptance as such or if the
person who told me this knew them to identify as such), then the
membership met, had a vote, and took away the award. I'm trying to get
more details.

A mainland haole is a white person from the mainland. Haole means white
more or less (the Hawaiian dictionary ties it to a type of white pig but
there are many narratives of what the word means; the joke is: when
whitie moves to Hawai'i, he/she has three things he/she can be: a haole,
a stupid haole, or a fucking stupid haole).

I'm more or less joking about the authorization. But there is a strong
sentiment that people from the outside should not talk on local issues.
We tend to get it all wrong.

I'm even hesitating to say such though b/c everytime I've brought up
this anger that there is here about people from outside coming and
appropriating or mistelling Hawai'i I get these long tirades on how the
basis of writing is story telling or whatever. (And then I begin to
understand the don't talk about (complain about) Hawai'i to people on
the mainland sentiment that is also prevalent.) I agree and normally
when someone tells me not to speak on something, I feel like I might as
well try and see if by trying I can learn something, but I also feel I
need to at least make the moves that declare what I am and how I am
coming at the place from the outside. History here is so built on
contradictory stories, and which stories one tells unfortunately tend to
be tied up with one's ethnicity, etc., that to confess one's position
when writing on local issues seems necessary.

As a small press publisher I'd advise doing this on a very selective basis.
Otherwise there will be no publishers, as library sales are the mainstay of
the business, and damned few poetry books as a result.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Thursday evening last, June 25, the Summer Reading Series at Naropa began
with a reading from Barbara Guest:

(Somebody told me she was 78 or thereabouts. Well, she looked wonderful).
Reading in a slow, grave voice, she opened with the title poem from
_Defensive Rapture_.

Width of a cube spans defensive rapture
cube from blocks of liquid theme
phantom of lily stark
in running rooms

And from "Dissonance Royal Traveller," in that same volume:

        sound opens sound
shank of globe          string floating out

***

the moon aflame on its plaza

Which might aptly serve as a description of this subtlest of poet's modus
operandi.

Following she read "The Advance of the Grizzly," - "who will walk out of the
plush interior into/the excited atmosphere?" and then new work, some of it
currently featured in New American Writing #16. Her purpose in this new
work, she told us, was to limit herself to poems of one page in order that
she might "restrict myself to certain things."

"The flower being the subject, it should  not be allowed to shadow the
page... it may be that absence is the subject of the poem."

Poems froms this set included "Deception," "Valorous Vine," and "The Green
Fly," written about the remains of the warrior unearthed from the mounds at
Sutton Hoo and now housed at the British Museum - it still gives her a
shiver even when she's just walking past it outside.

Multiple tunes  sunrise  gloaming

auditorium light.

Naked in thy boat.

Guest closed with "Leaving Modernity," ("a subject that saddens me"), from
_Quill, Solitary Apparition_, a work whose genesis she recounted as having
taken place while gazing upon the plane trees in the moonlight outside
Wheeler Hall at Berkeley.

        that perpendicular
restive procedure of stone

(and the buttress)
the mouthing  mouthing

(not apparition)
        Not Apparition

larger and further away.
        the dark rhyming.

What Has The World Done?

The minimalist architecture of Guest's poems operates to maximal effect,
creating an impression that is at once sensuous and haunting. This is a
music of serious patience and deep attention, in which what can be found
only in the lacunae between things are allowed to appear. Her work is
delicate but never precious - exemplifying the rare impoverishment necessary
to achieve the most extraordinary luminosity. A poetry of great slow
inhalations - the spanning of time, the absences contained therein,
accomplished by a precise sequence of vowels strung like lattice work, like
tesserae, across the open space of the breath.

###

Peter Gizzi read next:  poems from his new book from Burning Deck,
_Artificial Heart_. Lines from "From A Field Glass" -- "now that children
are playing on this street their game will become an entire century... the
object is the space where lines return to figure..." This was followed by
"Toy," and then "Ding Repair," also included in the marvelous _An Anthology
of New (American) Poets_.  A ding, as Peter explained for non-West Coasters,
is a small gouge in a surf board; the sign "ding repair" hangs in surf shop
windows all season long. The poem itself is a response to his move west  -
to the idea of order and disorder in the far west, "America in extremis," as
he put it (bringing to mind Louis Simpson's _At The End of the Open Road_,
for one).

Imagining another home far from here
not from where we have come but from where we imagine,
where vulnerability won't reproduce cruelty.

***

little flowers dot the hills, for they too
are a part of themselves...

***

Think of an empty closet, some childhood there
an odor of cedar, order of secrets repeat
their sequence and the useless treasure of an ending.

After this came "Fables of Critique" and "Tout Les Matin Du Monde," and then
Gizzi closed with a long, powerful piece, ala Cesaire, - a huge rush of
muscular lyricism that was much a confrontation with lyric as an expression
of it, and that hinged on the repeated phrase, "The heart of poetry is..."
as in "The heart of poetry is fatigue, it makes the space around a toy
majestic."

Gizzi's poetry, in part it seems to me, takes much of its shape and force
from  the need to respond to or reconfigure the condition of exile (physical
or spiritual).   At the same time, it both enacts and offers a highly
self-conscious critique of the ways in which the narrative impulse seeks to
alleviate the anxiety we feel at the unanswerable mystery of being alive.

###

Mei Mei Berssenbrugge closed the evening. Her first poem was "Health," from
her new book, _Four-Year Old Girl_ (forthcoming from where?).  Her long long
lines defy excerpting though I did manage to catch this fragment of one:
"orange light collects on the horizon like an anatomical drawing." "Health"
is a meditation on the female body, specifically on a pregnant female body -
on images of uterine space, on embryo, fetus, placenta - on slow nurturing
and emergence.

Next, from the same book, she read "Kali" - an entirely different evocation
of the feminine, a poem of ceremony and initiation using a dry, almost
scientific language that deliberately defied the lyrical yet was invaded by
it anyhow at various points around the margins. The phrase "since this
communication stretches indefinitely" I thought offered the evening's second
apt self-description of poetic M.O.

Following this came "Suzi Kiki Annie" - a poem smart with a sense of sly
deadpan humor that Mei Mei almost apologized for having written in short
lines ("walking toward two animals asleep in late light like blood") (and
this gem of a line, I feel like I heard it a dream: "the ambiguity releases
energy"). She closed with a very funny poem entitled "Dressing Up Pets."

Berssenrbrugge's poetic practice remind me of a perpetual motion machine in
which ambiguity is the fulcrum and principle of a constant becoming, a
constant entering-into-somewhere-else. The ambition of her long line is not
to circumscribe the world, but to inscribe it, unceasingly, if that were
possible, affecting an endless stratigraphy that is also simultaneously a
kind of en-presencing to the flow of time, time in the line, limber and
sinewy and yet also packed with hard, distinct nodes of thought and emotion.
The line as instrument to disclose the infinite fragility of the human
condition, its hesitations, contradictions, refusals and assentings - its
great heap of qualifications, ongoing. Its infinite beautiful distinctions.

Well, I can't speak for large libraries, but we often receive samples -- of
various and sundry types -- that we even might be intrigued by, but don't
follow up on. Subscription is thorny, as we work through a "jobber" and
subscription costs increase on a yearly basis, complicating our already
limited funds. In addition, we have been known to refuse or discard
donations (albeit not small press poetry) because of serious space and
storage problems. Yet if patrons request something in particular, we will go
out of our way to get it. This isn't just a case of squeaky wheels, but also
that we want our collection to consist of stuff people want to read.

Mark Weiss has a good point, too. As small as our budget is for an
institution, we've got a lot more to throw around than most individuals.
Libraries, as foci for availability of information, should support the
sources of this availability.

Actually, many poets _do_ teach middle and high school. Conversely, many
middle and high school students like poetry and prefer stranger kinds of
writing. Here are a couple of poems by middle schoolers at the School for

IT'S ALWAYS FAIR

I will never finish any of this
because I decided to boycott all the things I need
Nowadays I dine in and take my drinks in the Mediterranean
Sometimes I'm the stone people tend to send
skipping over ripples in a lake
and I've always slept like a rabbit
I am on everywhere's vacation to anywhere
I am a big shiny disco ball that loves people who dazzle
and makes the seagulls choke on their own ocean

The classroom teacher was Anne Yerger, and the writers-in-residence from
Teachers and Writers Collaborative were Chris Edgar and myself. Anyway,
Pinsky's _met_ David Frey, and I believe he knows that
writers-in-residence programs put poets in schools in New York, San
Francisco, Houston, Chicago, Minneapolis, Seattle, and smaller cities
across the country. He may also be aware that some places consider an MFA
qualification enough to apply to be certified (as teachers, you wags).

Releasing the umfas on the schools might not be such a bad idea -- not for
full year classes, but for ten or twenty-day gigs. Why not make it a
movement at the next AWP convention? or the MLA, for that matter, to have
some kind of community service (e.g. public school) requirement for
graduation might be a little old-shoe, but what about offering that
service to the community?

What's wrong with going to a poetry reading?  Why does one have to admit or
not to admit to go hear (or see) poetry?

tosh:

the reason is not reasonable--but "slams"
are not reasonable--as competition isn't--and does NOTHING
for the language. Subversion
does more.

"My thesis, which owes a lot to Wittgenstein (1953), is that whenever
human behavior is analyzed in terms of rules, these rules must always
contain a ceteris paribus condition, i.e., they apply "everything else
being equal," and what "everything else" and "equal" mean in any
specific situation can never be fully spelled out without a regress.
Moreover, this ceteris paribus condition is not merely an annoyance
which shows that the analyisis is not yet complete and might be what
Husserl called an "infinite task." Rather the ceteris paribus condition
points to a background of practices which are the condition of the
possibility of all the rulelike activity. In explaining our actions we
must always sooner or later fall back on our everyday practices and
simply say "this is what we do" or "that's what it is to be a human
being." Thus in the last analysis all intelligibility and all
intelligent behavior must be traced back to our sense of what we are,
which is, according to this argument, necessarily, on pain of regress,
something we can never explicitly know."---from From Micro-Worlds to
Knowledge Representation by Hubert L. Dreyfus---cp
