I have seen it used as a variant of grim, but I believe it may also refer
to a kind of white or pale color. But not sure.

On the Boards presents
A new intermedia collaboration
Spring from Undertime (Awaking Awaiting)
by Internationally-acclaimed artist Gary Hill,
and writers/artists George Quasha and Charles Stein
March 3 - 4, 2000.

On the Boards explores the intersection between the visual and
performing arts when internationally-acclaimed Seattle artist Gary Hill
and writer/collaborators George Quasha and Charles Stein premiere a new
intermedia work, Spring from Undertime (Awaking Awaiting), March 3 and
4, 2000. The artists utilize a wide variety of innovative projection,
video and lighting techniques, as well as live and recorded spoken word,
and sound manipulation to investigate the perceptions of  =ECreal=EE and
=ECelectronic=EE information, and explore such abstract concepts as
perception, language, and time. This adventurous performance for live
performers, computers, laserdisc players, samplers, midi controllers,
infrared and strobe lights and other sound/image generating devices is
the culmination of a two week residency by the artists, and is supported
in part by the Seattle Arts Commission=EDs Diverse Works program.
For performers, computers, multiple projections, laserdisc players,
sampler, midi controllers, infrared and strobe lights, video cameras and
other sound/image generating devices.

Tapping into live and prerecorded images, sound, texts and language
fragments, installation artist Gary Hill and poet/artists George Quasha
and Charles Stein collaborate in two nights of situation-specific
performance.  Though utilizing a wide range of technical devices =F3
infrared and strobe lights, multiple video projections, multi-sound
processing and state of the art display and transformation of electronic
and live information =F3 the real matter of the event is time &
awareness.  The mind of the artists and the mind of the audience are
called to a common place of co-creative inquiry.  What is time and what
can it be through newly excited awareness?  What happens to real time
when spontaneous sequences of image, sound and language open into a
whirlpool of new relations?  What if time itself transforms in the
neurological gaps between time & image & language mating in
unprecedented ways? Can we awaken through invisible actions and shifting
realities to a deeper sense of time =F3 its productivity, its flow, its
possibility?

Performances are Friday, March 3 and Saturday March 4 at On the Boards,
Behnke Center for Contemporary Performance, 100 West Roy Street (corner

It's your choice.  You could spend yr Saturdays doing nothing at all -- or
you could pull off something at least twice as fulfilling.  I'd recommend
the latter, namely: taking a swim in the underground river of words at

THE DOUBLE HAPPINESS READING SERIES.

Come drink of the fountain of wisdom? Perception? Acuity? Or just get a
two-for-one drink at the bar & listen to the double bill of fine poets
we've lined up each and every Saturday.

DOUBLE HAPPINESS is located in what may still be a speakeasy underneath 173
Mott Street at Broome.  The readings begin at 4:00pm & they'll run you a
cool $4.  It's very easy: 4 Saturdays, 4 o'clock, 4 dollars.  The money
goes to the poets.  Everything else is yours.

Brendan Lorber has been delighted to call himself your host all through
February & continues to do so in March as well.  He may continue even after
that, although he won't actually be "the host" anymore.  I wouldn't trust
much of what he says actually.  Like right now -- why's he talking about
himself in the third person like this? Lets move on.

Here's the cast of characters this month at DOUBLE HAPPINESS

March 4: Ange Mlinko / Andrew Epstein

Ange Mlinko is the author of Matinees (Zoland Books). She keeps coming back
to Brooklyn (via Morocco, Providence, and Boston).

Andrew Epstein is the author of the chapbook A Possible House.  His work
appears in Raritan, The Review of Contemporary Fiction, Verse, Ribot, Combo
& LUNGFULL!

********************************************

March 11: Issue Zero: The Literary Magazine Conference in New York
As you may have already heard, ISSUE ZERO is a three-day conference that
takes place at the St. Mark's Poetry Project on Friday March 10 at 10:30
pm, at Double Happiness on Saturday March 11 at 4:00pm and The Zinc Bar on
Sunday March 12 at 5:00pm.  Representatives of literary magazines from
around the country will convene to discuss their journals & read some of
their favorite work from within.  Participants will be different each
evening & Double Happiness' lineup looks like: Fence  /  Ixnay  / Read Me
/  The Germ  / Chain  /  Fish Drum  / Tool A Magazine.

********************************************

March 18: Tom Devaney / Kimberly Lyons

Tom Devaney's first book of poems is The American Pragmatist Fell In Love
(Banshee Press). His work has appeared in many magazines across the country
and most recently on the walls of San Francisco in the pieces of a young
graffiti artist name "Zero," who read his poem "Obi-Wan Kenobi" in
LUNGFULL! Magazine where Devaney is a contributing editor. He also writes
puppet plays for the experimental puppet group "The Lost Art of Puppet" and
continues to write about idea in art and poetry he calls "animated
realism." He lives in Brooklyn and teaches English as an adjunct at
Brooklyn College.

Kimberly Lyons is the author of several chapbooks including _Six Poems_
(Lines), _Strategies_ (Prospect Books) and In Padua (St. La Zare Press).
She was also program coordinator for the St. Marks Poetry Project.

Sharon Mesmer's old book is Half Angel, Half Lunch (Hard Press, 1998) Her
new book is The Empty Quarter (Hanging Loose Press, 2000). She has been
published recently in the anthologies Outlaw Bible of American Poetry,

Elizabeth, thanks for your post. Lots in it, I only want to deal with one
point right now : yes, CB is still white, & there's the rub. He is caught,
innocent yet complicit, in history.

As Jamie I and countless other men are caught in history, the history of
the patriarchy. As, in your different way, are you women. I dont mean we
can't alter the situation. But there's no blank slate to start from.  Even
after I wrote to dissociate myself from 'men,' I was a man. Any time I go
on automatic pilot, I will be 'men' again. But the system is not one I
dreamed up then imposed.

So I am guilty of what I have not done (as well as of what I have done),
but not as a sin of omission. Rather it's a case of 'the sins of the
fathers...'  But no more than CB could give up the advantagre of being
white, do I think I am entirely capable of giving up the advantage of being
a man.

So, then what? Rail? Why not? It's just that I don't see the use of
approaching the difficulty in this way. I can only try to change if
specific patterns are indicated. What would you like me to stop doing, &
how would that help you?

Do I argue just like a man? Sigh. Probably.

PS : I know the CB anecdote, and I think mine is more to the point. The
German housekeeper and the English cowhand came to no definite unraveling,
they slowly grew to see one another in three or four dimesnions. Thinking
of it as literature, I would end my anecdote with the cowhand sitting at
the kitchen table stunned to be hated for being something he had not much
good to say of himself, at that point in adolescence.

CB tells us only what we already know.

Talk about tacky! I feel like I have cooties, being linked, however
casually, to CB! Ugh. Get these things off me! -- Please dont do that
again, unless you really have to. Try Grahame Greene next time, or at least
John Fowles.

Whenever John Martin would give me the latest CB, I'd read it all that same
day, then have to lie down with nausea. It was like a candy, I couldnt stop
till it was all gone. I get the heaves just writing about his writing.
Yuck! Did he  really get me to _do_ that?

And that tacky feeling, is something like I feel when I am addressed as
'men.' Help! History is a gluepot, & I am a dinosaur. Hmm, let's take up
ageism next....

Best to you, & keep those cards n letters coming in.  David B.

So is it that "cultural capital" is the realm of the worker, and "prestige"
that of the boss?  It's a weird kind of contraction - as if prestige were
the result of converting the perpetually expanding boundaries or "turning
gearwheels" of cultural capital into an over-riding kind of "pay-per-view"
perpetuum of "taste" that sustains what looks suspiciously like a kind of
proprietary monarchy.
Prestige operates very much like a flywheel - once it's in motion, it takes
very little energy to keep it going; it depends on a closed system that is
perpetually off balance, a form of mechanical efficiency, tho it probably
isn't quite so inflexible.  One question that comes up in this kind of
systemization is, where does innovation arrive from?  Like, what's its
source?  Or how does it enter the system, become part of it, change it,
wreak it?  Or does it even "do" any of these things?  There's a weird sort
of inversion in this, in that, tho innovation is a singulular effort, and
may lead to and end in a position of prestige, prestige itself works to
thwart further innovation that wld threaten its position.  So maybe cultural
capital works antithetically or bi-directionally - on the one hand,
upholding the high chair of prestige by providing "meanings" that support
it, while at the same time working interpretively to innovate against its
otherwise dead(ly) incumbency.  Prestige is essentially a form of
unification or flag-loyalty, unity being, according to Ed Dorn, "a
psycho-philosophical pressure [that] has nothing to do with a poem.  The
instrumentation of language itself is an active audience, with its own ideas
and its own content and its own need to make its expression ... "  -
cultural capital being thus very active, and not at all a reservoir of
knowledge one then applies or reads into a particular context; that's the
realm of prestige - distribution from above, rather than construction from
the ground up.  They're like, what's the word? - co-tangent? - or they
intersect and at those points one hopes to find (or found) the conflict that
moves one "forward" or "deeper" into, well, just what, exactly?  A subtle
form of cultural warfare?  Or certainly a vying for a kind of power, if not
so much to possess it, then to see it through to some sense of flexibility
not so easily ruled.

My husband being a translator I of course am both quite fond of the art and
quite aware of the amount of bad translation out there (in the peculiar
dialect I have come to know as "translationese" -- not quite English,
certainly not as vibrant as a pidgin or creole....)

And knowing no language other than English I am grateful for the good
translations that exist.  Translation is a service, an important although
never perfect one, local to its time and place, almost an act of
anthropology (communication across cultures) mixed with perhaps telepathy
and communion with the dead.

Only as a student reading required readings is one forced to slog through
turgid English versions due to some hearsay relation to the original text.
As for what one is reading when one is reading a translation: one is
reading a translation.  Of course.

I have never read Celan.  But I read Joris' translation of Celan, and his
notes on his translation, and this opened up possibilities in English that
I had never imagined.  Why not?

Subject:      gender
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

I'm overjoyed to see gender raised yet again on this list and am as
always fascinated by the responses it garners.

I love talking about gender. I want to hear more about the 8 genders. I'd
like to talk about how being maybe 2 or 3 genders at once maybe affects
things associated with writing, like posting to e-mail lists, sending in
work to be published, public reading personas (!), publishing one's own
work. I also like talking about lost women writers--like how I just
discovered an old book by Dorothy Richardson, and who she was, and why
her books aren't in print anymore, and why maybe that happened. Liquid
gender.

I read that article in the NYTimes last weekend about how there were some
"good" Germans who did help Jews escaping the holocaust, and how they
weren't put in such mortal danger by doing so, and that this makes those
who didn't help that much more complicit in evil.

I don't think it's really that acceptable to say that "my ancestors
didn't buy slaves so I am not part of racism now." Or that "while many
other men may be sexists, I myself am a wonderful feminist." Personally,
I prefer show not tell. Each time gender is raised on this list, it seems
there's a sort of rush to establish oneself as an ardent feminist for
various reasons, while I think that for the most part gender is raised so
we can talk about gender, not how oneself is not a sexist, feinting at
imaginary opponents so to speak.

Peace & love to all.

Hi Katie,

fatbrain.com and iUniverse.com were featured in the latest Poets & Writers
Online, as ways for poets to circumvent the publishing industry (Jaclyn
Pare's "Is Democracy Ever a Bad Idea?"). Looks like both are more-or-less
similar to The International Library of Poetry (http://www.poetry.com),
although admittedly fatbrain only charges $1 per page to house your stuff.

Constantly on the lookout for fun material to collage, I went to the
fatbrain.com site to check out the poetry pdf files for sale. Found what
follows. I haven't excerpted or edited; these appear just so on the site
iteself. I think there are now 39 pdf files for sale; I just couldn't keep
going after "god grows a moustache" (the 12th or so entry), it was *too*
perfect:

" Kings for a Day " Poetry; Saint Michael
Author; 12/1999; $2.00 ; 1 pages
How fine is line between poerty and prophecy, here is and attempt to define
the line.

"Laughing at the World" through Poetry; Saint Michael
Author; 10/1999; $19.95 ; 15 pages
My poetry is a composite of collected dreams and meditations centered on
Christ, Jesus and His teachings. Enveloping both the Old and New Testament
writings. I was born in Seattle Washington 57, grew up in Alaska and spent
many years as a merchant marine sailing on Tow Boats in the Pacific. My own
personal relationship with God and the reading of His Holy Bible, Lead me by
inspirational dream and visions to Jerusalem Israel and the mid East where I
sojourned between the River of Egypt and the Euphrates for over 7 years.
These poems are a few I feel moved to release publicly at this time.

(Poetry) A Therapeutic Relationship; Ann Hollander
10/1999; $4.95 ; 1 pages
This poem is about the author's feelings for her psychotherapist. It deals
with issues of trust, psychological healing, hopes and dreams.

Birds in Wires \ A collection of prose and poetry; Alexander Girshin
Author; 11/1999; $2.00 ; 7 pages
Sample of a poem: After the Fall Nothing is real - not death, not life. It
all seems like a big old stupid dream. I cannot relate to anything that is
around me. Nothing is real. It's like those English drama episodes on A&E.
All things move at the wrong speed, at a lesser quality. There is no hope,
only anxiety. There is no love, only a lust for human energy. I am sick but
I do not feel sick because, I am the sickness. Now I am utterly alone,
separated from humanity, separated from nature; standing on a dry, barren
plain under a purple-black sky I hear the indignant voice, "You have
sinned."

Black Roses: Poetry of Shadow and Passion; Jari Winter
Self Published; 10/1999; $2.00 ; 1 pages
Eight poems, some with meter, all with meaning.

Boss - Poetry In The House; Gerard Johnson
12/1999; $2.00 ; 1 pages
This is how some of us feel about those in charge. See if you feel the same.

Bright Little Leaf 'a book of children's poetry for young readers those
young at heart'; Harry S. Harvey Jr.
12/1999; $11.99 ; 32 pages
Bright Little Leaf is a poem about an autumn leaf not content with her lot
in life. She has literally "soaring" aspirations and a definite itinerary.
Her ultimate fate however, is not quite what she envisions.
   Bright Little Leaf's full color illustrations are appealing, vivid and
very imaginative. It is a delightfully engaging and informative book for
young readers and those young at heart.
   Some who grew up with "the tube," having had virtually everything spelled
out in black and white and later in color, and being left with less and less
to imagine lapsed into jaded and desensitized perspectives. Their awesome
power of imagination having been stunted or withered by lack of challenge
and stimulation. They know that leaves don't sing_leaves only rustle, and
winds don't talk_winds just whine, whistle or howl. Ah! But hope springs
eternal! Let young children in wonderment, shut their eyes for a brief
moment and ask them to listen intently; they will hear a small autumn leaf
"sing" and a frisky fall wind gallantly "speak" to her plea!
     The magic lives on!

Changing Impressions -- Selected Poetry of David Scott; David Scott
Author; 01/2000; $5.00 ; 26 pages
Our perspectives change as we mature. As a young man, I was caught up in the
senses. Love was visual and involved a lot of touching. Now I see love as
extending far beyond the senses. It is both spiritual and human, and it
transcends time. These poems reflect those changing perspectives.

Cigarettes & Frustration - Poetry of an Induced Reflection: 1995-1998; Gary
T. DuVall
10/1999; $5.00 ; 33 pages
Dena Maria Martin brings us into the mind of a woman trapped in a home for
the elderly.

ramblings constructed while at various bizzarre venues and places from
Amsterdam to the far North.

full-length collection of poetry entitled, when you are finished it should
look like this.

I asked Michael Stanislawski, a professor here who's more-or-less fluent in
both Yiddish & Hebrew if he'd ever run across "gream," and he said it's
neither. He looked at it in context & suggested it might be a coined word
(my own suspicion). It's also a not-super-uncommon surname; maybe a pun on
some Gream we might have known about when Kaddish was written? But, looks
like a coined word (or typo/misprint?): grieve/scream?

Dr. Schultz, the web site

might help where you'll find "gream" is a French pun: NB : GRIM (en
anglais : menacant) + SCREAM -> GREAM. Probably not applicable to Whitman,
but worthy of laughter. Or. . .this is Whitman's way of encoding death:
Grim Reaper -> Gream. Hope that helps, although I'm sure it doesn't.

Announcing 4 New Chapbooks from Meow Press:


Madonna Fatigue, by Heather Fuller

Two of Everything, by Lisa Jarnot

Catalogue, by Alan Loney

and

Signature, by Stephen Ratcliffe


While I am announcing these books today, they will not be available through
Small Press Distribution for another week, since I am only assembling them
now. But, I am very excited to be announcing so many publications at once;
it's the product of some dedicated work in late December and the (since
then) very limited amount of time I am able to spend in production.

Many people on this list will know the poets whose works are listed here:
Lisa, Heather and Stephen are well known in American poetry circles; but
that audience is less likely to know the work of Alan Loney, who has at
least two books on Auckland University Press. The New Zealanders on the
list will have to help me attest to the wonder and power of Alan's writing.
Perhaps SPD carries his books; if not, they're worth hunting down and
ordering direct.

While I prefer that orders go through Small Press Distribution, I will
accept package orders on all four (plus one from the back list) for twenty
dollars, USA shipping incl. If you think you might be interested, you
should really think about it first. TRADE COPIES AVAILABLE. Inquire within.

you are on the track! Yes--the commodity is important to poets--odd--nothing

must say that when people appear on ReMaps they do get free subs cuz I can't

disheartened by yr response abt my work not being right because you
published work that was not like mine. I was lost as to what that meant.
Also--poverty my friend. With a baby and a house and a wife and an odd
normal existence where each dollar counts-1,-2,-3-,-I got lazy. You're
right! I should have continued reading yrs. My fault. As for yr work--I did
respond! Reemmeber? I did I swear! And that yr work did not fit the theme of
LOVE that our current issue published. I was specific--I swear! Plus--some
of the work we all publish others don't want to read--right?

I wanted to read everything that came my way--but we must respond to o each
other. dialogue.

which this is.

sorry this sounds personal as I read it but--my poetics is also my response.
anyways-- lets continue the talk! Send me the address I lost of yrs please.
alls,

Tb

Dear Todd:

As you know, I've published Inscape (7 issues) for a couple of years now and
that's withering on the vine for a lack of interest, too.
It seems to me that when our readership is composed mainly of poets and
other editors, those poets and editors expect to receive complimentary
copies, and if a poet's work is not being published by a particular mag they
may not see much point in subscribing to it because it isn't honoring the
work that they're most interested in (their own).
I also think that magazines like ReMap and Inscape, which are produced in a
manner that is affordable for the publisher to make and distribute without
much, if any ,additional support from the government or subscribers, are not
as attractive to the poetry community as perfect bound journals which
resemble commodities/commercial products of mass reproduction.
And, if you'll permit me a personal observation, you solicited work from me
for ReMap but never responded as to whether that work had been accepted or
not. I know of another magazine, to which I was the 7th subscriber ever,
signing up for a 3 year subscription, who similarly does not respond to
solicited work or even send me the copies I paid for as a subscriber! So
there's the matter of personal incompetence to consider when analyzing the
eventual failure of a project.
In the case of Inscape I've started a new, more narrowly focused, project
taking this stuff into consideration.

Gream
Your name of Gream gives you a strong sense of responsibility in business
and material affairs, and the practicality and determination to make a
success of anything you undertake. Your ability to organize and direct the
efforts of others enables you to excel in any managerial position because
you have the ability to grasp the concept of a goal complete with an
understanding of the steps to be taken. This name has allowed you to develop
depth and breadth of mind. You are able to retain facts, to add new
information to your existing store of knowledge. You never seem to be out of
your depth of understanding. For these reasons others who may not have the
same quickness of mind classify you as a "know it all" and, although you may
be highly respected, this characteristic is unlikely to endear you to your
associates. You have a very responsible nature, are capable and mature, and
are willing to assume a position as a pillar of the community. You are quite
healthy, but possible trouble areas are found in the generative organs.

Gream, the brief analysis of this baby name is not complete. There are many
additional factors (nicknames, last name, names and initials in your
business signature, and birthdate, etc.) to be considered, or that affect
your personality and life. A personalized Name Report™ will give you a
comprehensive description of your unique abilities, inner potential,
strengths and weaknesses, compatibility in personal and business
relationships, career aptitudes, health, and degree of happiness and
success.

Hee.  Hah.  Hoh.

I shall name all of my children Gream, though I might be forced to worry
about their "trouble areas" in their "generative organs."

Patrick

Gary:

Yup! I have no argument against it: everything that's currently calling itself
'poetry' on the Fatbrain site is ... well, I hesitate to call it _pure_ crap,
because there's definitely a certain amount of collage and to be had from trying
to read it, but!

But they want me to create a poetry category! So I'm posting in an attempt to
attract stuff that has literary value as something other than collage fodder.
Although the pieces which appear below are available for sale on the site,
Fatbrain isn't promoting them. They recognize (probably only because I've
pointed it out to them, but) the fact that there's currently no literary content
on their site, and want to attract it. If I can attract actual content, I can
create a promotional page, on which sample poems, poet photos, and interviews
with poets, can be featured. The kind of content you've sampled below (and
there's TONS of it, not only in the poetry category: one of my favorite entries
is a board game for 5th graders: "Pogrom: A Game of Jewish History") won't
appear on the promotional page -- people have to access it either by a) getting
an e-mail from their dear friend Saint Michael telling them to check out his
latest "peotry" at the below URL or b) thumbing through the Subject Search
stacks, much as they might to in order to find first editions of Rod McKuen in
the dustiest corners of a run-down bookstore.

Re: the $1 fee: this isn't currently being charged, and won't start to be
charged for at least another month, possibly longer, so if you happen to have
PDF files, and wouldn't mind having a URL to which to point people, you haven't
even got a buck to lose by trying it briefly.

I want to thank Peter, Philip, Gary, Susan & her student Jesse John for all
adding to my knowledge, which I've passed on to Linh. The grieve or grim
combine with scream seems pretty consistent (especially in context). The
fact that that French site has what looks like a Blair Witch knock-off with
that title really cements it.

On Saturday night, March 25, at 7:00 PM, at the Hugo House in Seattle, a few
friends and "admirers" of Ed Dorn's work will gather for a memorial reading.

The plan is for each reader (among them, Tom Raworth, Charles Potts, John
Daley, Belle Randall, Bob Rose, Judith Roche, Paul Nelson, Phoebe Bosche and
myself) to read for about ten minutes, either something of Ed's or something
written in response to Ed's work. We're working on setting up a video link
to Chicago, where other people might be gathering to do the same thing, but
that's as yet unsure.

More details will be forthcoming as we get a little nearer to the actual
event. What I'd like to do now is invite anyone within the sight of these
words who might find themselves close to Seattle around that time to attend
and/or participate -- (Billy Little: still on the list? How about others in
Vancouver?) Back-channel queries will get you everything I know so far.

Thanks! I hope to see some of you there.

[Apologies for cross posting ...]

Many years ago (early 70s) I did pieces for multiple simultaneous voices.
Thanks to the generosity of the Electronic Poetry Center, those pieces are
now available at:

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/rosenberg/

I very nearly lost these works.  On the above page I thank the many people
to whom I owe a debt of gratitude for saving these works, but here I
especially want to thank David Bromige, Loss Pequeño Glazier, and Martin
Spinelli.

I need to say a special word about David.  As the web page explains, my
visit to David's house in Sebastopol all those many years ago changed my
life in incalculable ways.  It was a house overflowing with the voices of
poets.  David is a launcher.  For whatever number of moons we have him
around, let's treasure him.  Thank you David ...

I'd gladly endorse what you say about Alan Loney's writing -- several of us
here regard him as a national treasure -- as poet, as book-designer, printer
& typographer, as controversialist, & as editor of "Parallax" (early 80s) &
more recently of "A Brief Description of the Whole World". He's been a
central figure in New Zealand poetry & poetics for 30 years.

That's a really good question. I think it applies to all digital
publishing (including those who get their books posted on Amazon with
the new "print on demand" feature they have). But as far as Fatbrain is
concerned, these are the differences I see:

a) It's free, at least for the moment -- actually, I think they're going
to waive the $1/month fee entirely for poets.

b) You can sell digital versions of chapbooks or journals that were
already published elsewhere, without any real cost to you except the
hassle of getting them into digital form, and retain all rights.

c) Easy public access. Anyone with web access can go to your URL,
download your book, and print it out. With a vanity press, people
generally only have access to your book if they have access to your
basement.

It's *not* distinguishable from a vanity press in that the simple fact
of having material available for sale on Fatbrain doesn't get you any
literary distinction whatsoever.

However, the site is set up so that there are category pages where the
editors pick out the good pieces, interview the authors, feature
excerpts, etc. So, if there are enough poets who are interested, this
part of the site could become a forum for poets, or a place to go to get
hard-to-find chapbooks or backissues of lit mags, etc. Kind of like a
digital library. I highly doubt that anyone's going to make a huge
profit at it, but I don't see any harm in it -- it's not much different
than self-publishing your own chapbook, which I've done, and although
chapbooks lose a lot texture-wise when they're digitized, at least you
can make the poetry more accessible. I would do it, if I didn't work the
job (I can't very well promote my own work on the site, so it's
pointless for me to publish on it).

To David B., did want to say to you that I feel the same complicity.  And I
admit that what I do about it is not always helpful; also the comparison
with CB was not an insult from my end, nor really a comparison (also: his
work was beloved by me at an earlier stage).

To Marcella D., I love and adore your framing. I myself do not feel safe
saying I am a wonderful ardent feminist, and I'm a bold (sometimes) girl.
What does that say about gender and politics and self, and most importantly
here, gender in writing? Not to mention the complicity above mentioned. I'm
not proclaiming myself evil (of course) but I can't say I understand
everything, esp about race -- which is why I wish more people would speak up.

Scary to say these things.
Some specifics:

I wish more people would speak up esp about poetics and gender. Reading
intrigued in _The Gender of Modernism_ last night, a spot where Zora Neale
Hurston says (about "Negro speech" -- in 1934) "In story telling 'so' is
universally the connective. It is used even as an introductory word, at the
very beginning of a story. In religious expression 'and' is used. The trend
in stories is to state conclusions; in religion, to enumerate."
and my friend Sarah Anne Cox (whose book it is) has noted in the margin
"Also in Ancient Greek".

I'm also interested in Angela Carter's irritation with Jean Rhys for being
so abject or whatever. I don't see Rhys that way. (Altho I was obsessed with
her writing at a more abject ?? period in my life.) (Actually tho I am still
obsessed with her. There is a very dear moment in her letters about needing
a bottle of wine and a new dress to get inspired to write again -- this in
deep old age and poverty.)

I'm trying to find the author of the poem that begins with the following
lines. Anyone help me?

How To Like It

These are the first days of fall.  The wind
at evening smells of roads still to be traveled,
while the sound of leaves blowing across the lawns
is like an unsettled feeling in the blood,
the desire to get in a car and just keep driving.
A man and a dog descend their front steps.
The dog says, Let's go downtown and get crazy drunk.
Let's tip over all the trash cans we can find.
This is how dogs deal with the prospect of change.


        Thanks,

        Jerry

All, & I crosspost to women's and buffalians,

Linda Russo is doing some fabulous critical work into gender and
canonization and other things (excuse me Linda if I have
misconstrued/flattened your approach) which can be read in _Verdure_ and at
How2 n 3. I'm not sure if How2 n 3 is quite up yet but when it is there is a
link thru my site (their url too complex to recall in this moment). I love
her coinage (or usage) of the term post-marginal, for a quick soundbite into
it. I also eagerly await the Talisman anthology which will include her
history of women's publishing. And I plan to put Marcella Durand's history
of women's publishing in NYC from Outlet (4/5) up on the Lucy site soon (if
that's ok with her?) -- all of these readings might provide better ways in
to discussing (literary/literal) gender than I have.

from Linda Russo's How2 piece:

"At a point when innovative women poets are no longer marginal [she
formulates this earlier in the essay], does it make sense to speak of
subversion as a poetic tactic? Or a poetic trinket? Is gender still a
relevant for locating subversive (or not) poetic practices by women? It
remains, indeed, a crucial queston for existence on a material, daily level.
.....  Margin and subversion, once-useful points of critique that did frame
the problematic have now become subsumed in the frame, have become part of
its materials and methods. Once politicized, now aestheticized. Thus having
announced one's affiliation to a certain aesthetic or tradition by taking up
a particular set of strategies, announcing, as it were, one's position in
the field of production, the question becomes whether this alignment further
politicizes or merely aestheticizes those strategies as "givens"."

My immediate questions: do I feel I've announced my affiliation? Do you?

How does the remainder of the question on a material, daily level continue
to impact our writing?

Can poetry really get so far ahead of reality?

Hi Jerry,

The poem you quoted is by Stephen Dobyns, published in Ploughshares volume
11, number 1, 1985.

No, I've never read Stephen Dobyns or Ploughshares before.

Jerry, don't know, but it's a lot like a Rilke poem called "Fall."
("Herbst," I guess). We had some duelling translations of this on the
Poetics List two-three years ago....anyone recall more on this?

My first thought for the "How to Like It" poem was Richard Hugo, though I
didn't think Hugo was quite so dreadful.  I looked him up in
Amazon.com--they have lists of poems in individual collections provided by
a service called "poem finder." It wasn't Hugo, but amazon told me that
people who had bought books by him also bought those by Bly, Stafford,
Hall, and Dobyns. It had a vaguely Staffordesque pseudo-Frostian tone
(that original bit about roads not taken), but the drunken dog doesn't
seem like anything he would write. Donald Hall is a little more refined
and Bly more pretentious.

So Dobyns it is! Though it could have been by countless others.  It can be
found in Velocities, New and Selected Poems.

What a fascinating thought! Nowadays, isn't "like" universally the
connective, at least in dialogue? Does that mean that "the trend in stories
is to state conclusions; in religion, to enumerate"; and in conversation to
draw connections?

sponsoring a talk tomorrow by oft-scintillating litcritic

, so I wrote my friend Gary Schwartz, a Dutch art critic and
Rembrandt-attribution expert, and was like, do you have any questions you
think I should ask Berger? (I know Berger's work on Renaissance
fictionality, and on Vermeer.) He was like, (rather acidically in a way,) I

(Not sure what the Hurston quote has to do with gender, Elizabeth, so I
feel less bad about ignoring gender in my post.)

Well, we know from the spelling that it is a USAmerican poet, and we
know from the casual lines of equal length and no great excitement re
rhythm that it is an academic poet of the kind we used to associate
with Iowa. Does that narrow it down?

Yes and lately I almost prefer such archives of seemingly misbegotten Desire
to reading or thinking about such things as "what in the #!@%&*!!! is
experimental poetry?" and etc. To be sure, this is voyeurism, in a cultural
capitalist such as myself --- so good to get down with the people, no?? ---
but I can't help finding a poignancy there that I can't chalk up wholly to
my own elitism (which is considerable). The next cultural criticism will
have to deal with Internet ruins as a locus of whatever we used to call
Desire. Are we missing the analyst that modernist technology had in Walter
Benjamin? I think we need one, though I can hear groaning and even barfing
at the very idea--- yet it's one of my personal canards that 'everyone wants
to be a writer' (this is what gets me through daily encounters with
22-yr-old dot-com-er multimillionaires and others who are really getting
somewhere in life), just as marx's was that everyone wants (and deserves) to
live a good life...

well not to self-flagellate overmuch. perhaps it's only a kind of
web-surfing psychosis

Hi Katie,

fatbrain.com and iUniverse.com were featured in the latest Poets & Writers
Online, as ways for poets to circumvent the publishing industry (Jaclyn
Pare's "Is Democracy Ever a Bad Idea?"). Looks like both are more-or-less
similar to The International Library of Poetry (http://www.poetry.com),
although admittedly fatbrain only charges $1 per page to house your stuff.

Constantly on the lookout for fun material to collage, I went to the
fatbrain.com site to check out the poetry pdf files for sale. Found what
follows. I haven't excerpted or edited; these appear just so on the site
iteself. I think there are now 39 pdf files for sale; I just couldn't keep
going after "god grows a moustache" (the 12th or so entry), it was *too*
perfect:

" Kings for a Day " Poetry; Saint Michael
Author; 12/1999; $2.00 ; 1 pages
How fine is line between poerty and prophecy, here is and attempt to define
the line.

"Laughing at the World" through Poetry; Saint Michael
Author; 10/1999; $19.95 ; 15 pages
My poetry is a composite of collected dreams and meditations centered on
Christ, Jesus and His teachings. Enveloping both the Old and New Testament
writings. I was born in Seattle Washington 57, grew up in Alaska and spent
many years as a merchant marine sailing on Tow Boats in the Pacific. My own
personal relationship with God and the reading of His Holy Bible, Lead me by
inspirational dream and visions to Jerusalem Israel and the mid East where I
sojourned between the River of Egypt and the Euphrates for over 7 years.
These poems are a few I feel moved to release publicly at this time.

(Poetry) A Therapeutic Relationship; Ann Hollander
10/1999; $4.95 ; 1 pages
This poem is about the author's feelings for her psychotherapist. It deals
with issues of trust, psychological healing, hopes and dreams.

Sample of a poem: After the Fall Nothing is real - not death, not life. It
all seems like a big old stupid dream. I cannot relate to anything that is
around me. Nothing is real. It's like those English drama episodes on A&E.
All things move at the wrong speed, at a lesser quality. There is no hope,
only anxiety. There is no love, only a lust for human energy. I am sick but
I do not feel sick because, I am the sickness. Now I am utterly alone,
separated from humanity, separated from nature; standing on a dry, barren
plain under a purple-black sky I hear the indignant voice, "You have
sinned."

Bright Little Leaf 'a book of children's poetry for young readers those
young at heart'; Harry S. Harvey Jr.
12/1999; $11.99 ; 32 pages
Bright Little Leaf is a poem about an autumn leaf not content with her lot
in life. She has literally "soaring" aspirations and a definite itinerary.
Her ultimate fate however, is not quite what she envisions.
   Bright Little Leaf's full color illustrations are appealing, vivid and
very imaginative. It is a delightfully engaging and informative book for
young readers and those young at heart.
   Some who grew up with "the tube," having had virtually everything spelled
out in black and white and later in color, and being left with less and less
to imagine lapsed into jaded and desensitized perspectives. Their awesome
power of imagination having been stunted or withered by lack of challenge
and stimulation. They know that leaves don't sing_leaves only rustle, and
winds don't talk_winds just whine, whistle or howl. Ah! But hope springs
eternal! Let young children in wonderment, shut their eyes for a brief
moment and ask them to listen intently; they will hear a small autumn leaf
"sing" and a frisky fall wind gallantly "speak" to her plea!
     The magic lives on!

Changing Impressions -- Selected Poetry of David Scott; David Scott
Author; 01/2000; $5.00 ; 26 pages
Our perspectives change as we mature. As a young man, I was caught up in the
senses. Love was visual and involved a lot of touching. Now I see love as
extending far beyond the senses. It is both spiritual and human, and it
transcends time. These poems reflect those changing perspectives.

Dodie,

Thanks for your reply. I'm certain that something like that is an issue here
in NYC too. Though exactly how, I'm not sure I can say. There are so many
subcells of every 'scene' --- itself a hydra. It interests me how
traditional power relations (those, that is, of what one flatters oneself is
a distant 'mainstream' society) seem to reassert themselves even among the
most enlightened --- that revolving dialectic of idealism and
totalitarianism. The trick maybe is not to be pessimistic about social
change, but (as you've already said) to remain alert to the challenges that
come not from an otherized enemy, but from within oneself?

Subject: Re: gender

Brian,

Thanks for bringing this issue up of gender essentialism.  I too have
felt uncomfortable here with the use of "gender," which seems to mean
the plain old male/female dichotomy that we might see, for instance
in a Sandra Dee movie.

In the experimental poetry world, particularly here in San Francisco,
it seems to me that there is a rigid definition of gender roles.
Women with power being powerful *ladies.*  If one is not a lady one
must either make oneself exotic at parties or be considered a bit
freakish.  And, yes, there are race and class issues involved in all
of this--sorry to mention that hoary thing again.

I'm not denying that the world is rampant with sexism, and I'll be
the first to admit that there are a lot of asshole guys on this list
and in the poetry world and beyond--but I think that the formula of
men = oppressors, women = oppressed is simplistic.  This is coming
from the perspective of someone whose writing project is to present a
radical female perspective but who has received encouragement/career
help from men--much more so than women.  Any theoretical writing that
has influenced my writing has been female/feminist, but the women I
find who are interested in discussing these sorts of writings are
female academics--not poets.

I've seen plenty of women censoring other women, and if I'm to be
ruthlessly honest, I've done it myself.  People are pissy and
judgmental and have their own little agendas.  Welcome to the world.

Thanks for the help with my mystery poet--both to those who had it right (Stephen
Dobyns, from Cemetery Nights) and those who came up with fascinating guesses (Wm
Stafford, Rilke, Joshua Beckman, Robert Sward, Ed Field). I guess it didn't sound

I'm tired of being the gender clown.

It depresses me that - if this list is an important forum - women don't post
to it or read it that much, esp women who are doing important work like
Rachel Levitsky, Lisa Jarnot, Summi Kaipa, Juliana Spahr, Renee Gladman, Hoa
Nguyen, Cole Swenson, Marcella Durand, Tisa Bryant, Kristin Prevallet, Yedda
Morrison, Jocelyn Saidenberg, Sarah Anne Cox, Liz Waldner,  etc etc etc etc.

I guess I'll look elsewhere.

In her forward to _The Gender of Modernism_, Bonnie Kime Scott writes:

"Modernism as we were taught it at midcentury was perhaps halfway to truth.
It was unconsciously gendered masculine. The inscriptions of mothers and
women, and more broadly of sexuality and gender, were not adequately
decoded, if detected at all. Though some of the aesthetic and political
pronouncements of women writers had been offered in public, they had not
circulated widely and were rarely collected for academic recirculation.
Deliberate or not, this is an example of the politics of gender. Typically,
both the authors of original manifestos and the literary historians of
modernism took as their norm a small set of its male participants, who were
quoted, anthologized, taught, and consecrated as geniuses. Much of what even
these select men had to say about the crisis in gender identification that
underlies much of modernist literature was left out or read from a limited
perspective. Women writers were often deemed old-fashioned or merely of
anecdotal interest. Similar limiting norms developed in the contemporaneous
Harlem Renaissance, which enters the scope of modernism as presented in this
anthology....
Gender is not a mask for feminist or woman, though they are inextricable
from it. Both men and women participate in the social and cultural systems
of gender, but women write about it more, perhaps because gender is more
imposed upon them, more disqualifying, or more intriguing and stimulating to
their creativity....
The connecting strands of association between modernists are more numerous
than we suspected....
The making, the formal experiment, no longer seems to suffice as a
definition (of modernism). Mind, body, sexuality, family, reality, culture,
religion and history were all reconstrued. In settling for a small set of
white male modernists and a limited number of texts and genres, we may have
paused upon a conservative, male strain of modernism, however valuable and
lasting those texts. The politics and aesthetics of gender may lie at the
heart of a comprehensive understanding of early 20th-c literature and its
full array of literary treasures. This collection attests that a great deal
of energy and creativity was subtracted out by gender from modernism."



Is this to happen again?

Subject:      Update on the end of the publication of DOMESTIC AMBIENT NOISE
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

As previously announced, the 299th pamphlet in the sequence DOMESTIC AMBIENT
NOISE will be published on Friday 31st March 2000; and the 300th pamphlet,
the last one, will be published on Saturday 1st April 2000.

With that, the publication project will end, although documentation etc will
continue for some time.

There will be a launch performance by DOMESTIC AMBIENT BUOYS, including
performance of DAN 299 (title to be announced), at The Klinker on 31st March
2000. (The Klinker is at The Sussex, 107a Culford Road, London N1, England,
Europe, The World)

DOMESTIC AMBIENT BUOYS on that night will be Lawrence Upton (voice), Bob
Cobbing (voice), Derek Scheel (sound sculpture) and Jennifer Pike (dance) +
slides

Doors open 8 a.m. Admission £4 / £2.00

Unfortunately, more acts have been added to the Klinker programme for that
night so it is unlikely that we shall be able to guarantee the performance
at 9 p.m. as originally announced. It'll happen at some point and will be
less extensive than planned, maybe half an hour - other performers that
evening, without DAN connotations, include Marci Mattos

Also, during 31st March 2000, a DAN exhibition will be set up at The
Klinker. By Saturday 1st April 2000, an exhibition of all 300 DANs will be
in place - each pamphlet available for examination and a wall-mounted
selection of pages from among about 2500 in total.

The exhibition will continue for a month & it is hoped that the WF workshops
for April will be held in the exhibition

DAN 300 (title to be announced) will be launched at 4 pm 1st April 2000 with
a performance by DOMESTIC AMBIENT BUOYS, who will perform again at 9 pm, and
again at the same times on Sunday 2nd April 2000.

It will be possible to order some or all (your decision) of the pamphlets
during that weekend.

It is *possible that a special edition of all 300 will be prepared later.

Documentation will include:

(a) a visual index, showing the front cover of each DAN in publication order
(b) a title index
(c) a diagram of the threads running through the series

(a) and (b) should be available for the exhibition; (c) will be available as
soon as it is available

Much of (a) and (b) is implicit in the data available at the WF website
already

http:// matrix.crosswinds.net/members/~writersforum/

So, hope to see you for some at least of that weekend - 5 performances and
an exhibition - what more could you want...

Though the buoys may afterwards be tempted out of dan-retirement, they're
likely to want to move on. So grab it while you may... Already fans as far
away as Whitstable and Glasgow have said they will attend

After releasing 42 pamplets between Jan of 1998 & Feb 2000, Tod asked me
to forward this. He has done a great service to the community here,
publishing many of us, tho his time is getting heavily eaten by his new
press, Spuyten Duyvil, now.

you know who i are. you know what i have done to them. i'm talking to you,
i know what you mean. i know what they've done to us. you don't need to
name names. the lakes and the rivers have been taken away; our lives no
longer belong to us - they belong to them. in these dark times, we must
beware; we can't be too careful. the future won't be ours, unless we am
wary at all times. i must look behind my back, rather in front of my back
(applause); they're always sneaking up. they'll hack into my life. they'll
take away my wife and my children. they'll devour you. you want to give
myself to i but how can i, when they're watching? what can they see? what
am i doing? they're unreadable, unapproachable. their language, if they
have any. i know what i'm referring to. they make the very atmosphere
poisonous around here. you can't breathe near them - it's almost a scent
they have. they see the world differently, you'd be amazed how much. we
have to arm. they'll remain nameless here - that should tell i something.
if i don't think you know what i'm talking about, read the newspapers,
magazines - watch my television, radio - look and listen for the signs -
they're everywhere - it's written all over this world of ours - they've
probably taken it to other worlds - above the oceans, beneath the seas. i
can't go anywhere without running into them, they're controlling you.
watch my step - i know whose steps they really are. they own the cities
and the countryside; they're like vermin, you don't need to name names.
it's a shame what they're doing to us, taking everything away from us.
we've got to be careful here. it's our right to fight back, to protect
ourselves. you can't even tell i how long this has been going on, as long
as anyone's been around. there's a certain danger in the air. they'll
betray i at the blink of an eye - they're like viruses, just when i least
expect, like cancers, they invade from within - i know who you mean. watch
your back, that's all i can say. they're watching your back. (applause)

                 THE NYE BEACH WRITERS' SERIES presents
                       "3 GUYS FROM ALBANY"
             touring the country with their performance poetry

                         MARCH 18, 8 P.M.  $5 admission
       in the Studio Theatre of the Newport Performing Arts Center
                 777 West Olive, Newport, Oregon
                             *****

"Better than MTV.  Better than VH1.  Better than the Mickey Mouse
Club!"-Georgia Popoff, Happy Endings Café, Syracuse, New York.

TOM NATTELL, CHARLIE ROSSITER and DAN WILCOX are friends who share the
idea
that poetry should be part of society rather than apart from
it-relevant,
communicative and above all, honest.  The "3 GUYS FROM ALBANY" program
includes poems that enthusiastically address social issues and fun using

costumes, noisemakers, recycled trash, audience participation and
coordinated multi-voice arrangements as well as standard readings. The
trio
is traveling the country, playing in every city named Albany they can
find.

The "3 GUYS FROM ALBANY" formed in 1993 and have performed their work
throughout the Northeast and Midwest in coffee houses, bars, libraries,
community centers, colleges and major poetry venues such as in the
Nuyorican Poets Café in New York City; Woodstock, New York; Glover,
Vermont
and Hartford, Connecticut as well as Albanys in Vermont, Wisconsin,
Illinois and Indiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky.

"This is the idea of poetry building community," Rossiter said. "We're
trying to help more people find out how neat poetry is."

As part of their goal of expanding the audience for poetry, their
"Pacific
Northwest Albany Tour" will also take them to West Albany High School,
Portland's Cafe Lena on March 17, GrassRoots in Corvallis, and Tsunami
Books in Eugene. They will be guests on Portland's KBOO's Talking Earth
program, hosted by Barbara LaMorticella on March 20 at 10 p.m. (90.7
FM).


DAN WILCOX's poems have been published in a variety of small press
magazines and anthologies.  He is also a photographer who has
accumulated
what may be the largest collection of photos of unknown poets in the
world.

CHARLIE ROSSITER, producer/host of Poetry Motel TV, has performed on
KPFA
in San Francsico, at the Kent State Gathering of Poets in Ohio, the
Forest
Gathering of Poets in Eugene, Oregon, and he helped organize all-day
readings at the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. He has also just

gone live on the Internet with www.poetrypoetry.com, a new international

audio poetry website.  With links to major poetry sites in Australia,
Canada and the UK already in place, poetrypoetry.com is aiming to become

the premiere world poetry "gateway" site by leading visitors to the best

sites on the globe for English-language poetry.

TOM NATTELL is an international mail artist, environmental and peace
activist who believes in using poetry and the other arts to advance
peace,
justice and a sane approach to the environment.  He originated and hosts

Albany's oldest continuous open mic series at the QE2.

I've put the final issue of Witz online at the Witz site:
http://www.litpress.com/witz

The paper version is not out yet, and this preview may have some typos, but
I wanted to get it out there. It's been a while.

The issue is in PDF format, so you'll need the Adobe Acrobat reader.

The issue has essays by Martin Nakell (on Bartelby the writer), Dan
Featherston (on Olson and Y2K), Patrick Pritchett on Tom Mandel, Brian Kim
Stefans (on Jeff Derksen), and Standard Schaefer (on Jean Day).

On paper soon. I'll let you know.

Hey,

Just wanted to let you know that a Buryat Mongolian Shaman's Chant that I
co-translated with Virlana Tkacz & Sayan Zhambalov is now on the stands in
the current issue of "Shaman's Drum: A Journal of Experiential Shamanism &
Spiritual Healing"

It also includes great photographs taken during a shaman's ritual that we
participated in while in Siberia a few years ago and other photos of that
shaman when he visited us here in the U.S.

Also in this issue is a review of a cd entitled "Uragsha: Instrumental and
Vocal Music from Buryatia and Mongolia" performed by Sayan Zhambalov,
Erzhena Zhambalov and Battuvshin recorded in NYC and put out by Global
Village Music in 1999.

I am writing to announce that Tod Thilleman is no longer editing Poetry New
York: A Journal of Poetry and Translation; I have been the Senior Editor of
this magazine and am now exploring the feasibility of keeping the magazine
going (despite the fact that a few contributors to the upcoming issue have
heard from me that I was going to let the magazine die--but I have been
prevailed upon to think over this perhaps hasty decision).

TOD THILLEMAN IS STILL EDITING, to my knowledge, THE PNY/MEB PAMPHLET
SERIES. I have never had anything really to do with that series and have no
information about it to tell anyone other than what I have just said.
Inquiries regarding the pamphlets should be directed to Tod, therefore.

As far as I can tell, TOD HAS MISINFORMED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE BY E-MAIL about
the status of these two concerns, the magazine and the pamphlet series. Why
this editorship change has come about need not, I feel, be detailed here.
But I do wish to say that I am most sorry for this turn of events.

If I do decide finally to fold the PNY tent then I will let as many people
as possible know that. I would, in this case, hope not to have to mail back
mss. to contributors but would upon request. I have the mss. Tod has handed
over to me, whatever there are in that package (I haven't had time yet to do
a careful accounting).

It was not my wish that PNY come to an end. Tod's resignation was sudden for
me. I am trying to decide now what to do and I hope people will forgive me
this public hand wringing. If I do let the magazine die then I will need to
begin what will be a long and complex denouement.

Moreover, if I try to go forward with the presently laid-out issue, there
will be a further delay in its publication (I don't have any discretionary
time for a while)--so anyone (please spread the word) who wishes to pull her
or his work from the issue because of the delay should notify me.

Again, I am sorry for the confusion, and for this turn of events generally.

Clark Coolidge
Joel Kuszai

Since the early 60s and the Vancouver Poetry Conference, Clark Coolidge has
been a vibrant center of modern American poetry.  His perceptions about the
thickness and musicality of language and description have altered the way
we read and write, and the hugeness of his scale, his extended solos and
inspired jazz-like composition have brought us back not only Jack Kerouac
but Gil Evans. His books include Space, The Maintains, Own Face, Mine: The
One That Enters The Stories, At Egypt, The Book of During, and more
recently, Keys to the Caverns, Book of Stirs, and Now It's Jazz.
Forthcoming are Alien Tatters from Atelos, Bomb from Granary Books and On
the Nameways from The Figures.  A longtime resident of the East he has been
living quietly among us for the past several years and we are very pleased
to invite him to read at Small Press Traffic.

Joel Kuszai is the author of A Miscellany and several other chapbooks of
poetry, including Filmic-10 and The Oversocialized, and some of his work
was included in Writing from The New Coast.  His best writing impresses
with its melodic thrusts and parries, its sophisticated modulations of
do-it-yourself feeling and yearning.  He came here from San Diego last year
and read briefly at our MLA Reading and we liked it so much we asked him to
come back and read more, longer, louder.  Since 1993, Joel Kuszai has
edited and published more than sixty chapbooks under the imprint Meow
Press, one of the indispensable presses of the 1990s.  In addition, there
is the brand new Poetics@ (Roof Books), which Kuszai marvelously edited, a
collection of writing from the Buffalo Poetics List that he moderated for
many years.

At the risk of posting something which seems to be completely un-poetry or

Brown's song "Please Please Please." Could someone please backchannel them
to me if they have them? I need them for a project I am currently working
on.

The students in Yugoslavia are protesting Milosevic's government and are
extremely active on the Net.

They seek
-Free and fair elections in Serbia
-Free Universities
-Independent media

There's an excellent student resistance site at http://otpor.com that describes
some of their work. And
http://www.nettime.org/nettime.w3archive/200003/msg00032.html is an interesting
AP article describing the student resistance and the 'poster war' happening
there. See also http://www.otpor.com/marketing/index.html for some of the
posters and other images they have developed.

They are being astute with the image. Their image of THE FIST is very inspiring.

Here we have an opportunity to support their important work rather than bomb
them.

http://www.vispo.com/TheFist/1.htm leads to a page containing THE FIST in
various file formats suitable for putting on your Web site in support of the
student resistance, if you like.  There's also a CorelDraw and a couple of Adobe
Illustrator files (PC and Mac)  that can be used to make much larger versions of
THE FIST for things like T shirts.

Feel free to use them as you please and help in your own way; that is what I
read on the otpor.com site, which seems like a very cool way to go. Supporting
them via the Internet on which they are very active, this seems an important
part of the so-called 'information revolution,' and much more helpful to all
concerned than bombs.

For Elizabeth, Payaso de La Guerra Nuestra,

Boy do I 'get' that feeling of tired.
At one point there was a thread
about lionization.
I wanna be lionized.
oh where is my faithful Alice

Or I'd like to be part of a scene
oh where is my left bank
or lefty bank

Elizabeth your work is like
a little bit of all of it and for so
many of us,
what would it be
like for us to converse here, would
it be different, us together versus
us with the guys, could we pretend?


And though Stein warned against
such a thing, I feel like quoting myself
"power is a bestial and desparate thing."

Utopianly yours,
R Democracy

PS--have an idea which I will backchannel to you

do tell, front channel or back, what the project is.  this song is a
masterpiece of minimalist vocabulary and maximalist affect --as well as a
personal fave.  it shd be pretty easy to transcribe the words from one of
the many recordings.

I have been thinking about jumping in here again. Constructions of
gender concern males as much as females. Why must I go to those authors
that Elizabeth Treadwell mentions in order to discover that there are
people thinking on the topic at all?. The silence of straight males on
'gender' probably speaks volumes. I have been running an analogy through
my mind, modeled on one of Foucault's more trenchant observations: the
soul is the prison of the body (Discipline and Punish). Why not : gender
is the prison of the body? My point, I guess, is that modernist poetics
as a whole is shy of the body. I suppose that is why I continue to read
and write on Charles Olson. Chauvinist of the highest rank though he is;
he did see the need for an embodied poetics.

Is it a poison topic because of the indiscretions that might come into
play when speaking of the body? when the body speaks? Is it a dull topic
because approaches to the body or gender must pass the muster of a
censorship that makes egalitarian treatment de rigeur? despite the
inequalities of practice? For me gender is the most intimate of the
filters that bears on what I feel I have permission to put into words. I
like my register to shift. I'm a pasticheur. I feel very confined when
it comes to putting on paper so many phrases that are somehow to my
hearing gendered. I do not want to transcend that confinement. I want to
test it.

Bad thought! maybe I am just doing "A Prisoner of Sex" trip here?

like all the lionized stein lines rec'd, David and Rachel, and b/c thank
you, and no Damion the Hurston quote had nothing to do with gender unless it
is the rearrangement of (every single own personal one of) them connected by
liking

did anyone else read the piece on Prince's music in Verdure? Makes me want
to steal all his titles! x

ps i love my gender! totally essential, dude.

Well, I could say,

I saw Jill Stengel of a+bend read with Lytle Shaw at the Cafe Balcony.
Lytle's work was funny and had lovely architectural moments.  Jill's
work was unfamiliar to me before yesterday.   She's got an unpublished
ms called "Book of Yes", but there was no oppt'y to ask what she thought
of the play "House of Yes".  The movie is bad, don't see it.  The
chapbooks are great, I bought Norma Cole's.  Jill says she is so busy
this is the only list she's on, and she has no time to post.  I believe
her, she's bringing out chapbooks like mad.

This time/gender business I think has been notably covered recently by
Maureen Owen.

It is hard for me to keep track of the forums Rachel Loden's made
different wise comments in -- perhaps I'm thinking about some of her
posts from cap-l.

If I can add anything, it is that it only gets worse as time goes on,
it's only worse outside art and academia.

Nevertheless, if no one else does soon, I will send my notes from the
quotidian conference, even though it too, I suppose quite distantly, is
complicit in Occidental & Colombian politics?

Palestine Poet Spurs Israeli Uproar


By Samar Assad
Associated Press Writer
Monday, March 6, 2000; 3:26 p.m. EST

RAMALLAH, West Bank: It has little to do with poetry, and a lot with
politics.

A decision by the Israeli education minister to introduce five works by
the Palestinian national poet, Mahmoud Darwish, as optional reading in
Israeli schools has incensed hawkish and religious lawmakers, who
threatened Monday to try to bring down Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
government over the verses.

Barak, apparently fearing another defeat in parliament after his coalition
crumbled last week in a key vote on peace with Syria, said time "is not
ripe" to teach Darwish, who as a PL member was banned from entering Israel
for 26 years.

The emotional dispute over a few lines of poetry illustrates how hard it
still is for Israelis and Palestinians to put aside resentments
accumulated in a century of conflict. It also signals that reconciliation
between the two peoples will take many more years, even if a formal peace
treaty is eventually signed.

Introducing Darwish into the curriculum is part of reforms begun by dovish
Israeli Education Minister Yossi Sarid.  "It is very important to know one
another. Ignorance is not the best recipe for good neighborliness," Sarid
said.

The opposition Likud party accused Sarid of "legitimizing the negation of
Zionism" and submitted a motion of no confidence in the government. The
religious Shas faction, a member of Barak's coalition, hinted it might
join Likud in next week's vote on the motion, which would embarrass, but
not topple the prime minister.

Darwish said Monday the uproar shows how fearful many Israelis are of
challenging long-held negative stereotypes about Palestinians.  "The first
step of real peace is to know the other side, its culture and creativity,"
Darwish, said in an interview.

Those who object to teaching his poetry in Israeli schools "cannot digest
that the other side has culture, creativity and intellect," Darwish said.
"They consider this to be a dangerous recognition of the other side."

The same accusations have frequently been made by Israelis who complain
that Palestinian textbooks and newspapers are filled with violent rhetoric
and negative stereotypes of Israel.

Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Amr said Monday that Palestinians have not
introduced Israeli poets into the school curriculum because the conflict
with Israel has not yet been resolved.  "We can't read them now because
... the relationship (with Israel) is not normal," he said.

To many Israelis, Darwish, 57, is synonymous with Palestinian nationalism,
even though few have read his poetry. In an essay on the 50th anniversary
of Israel's founding, Darwish wrote in 1998 that the Jewish state was
founded on the "dual injustice" of dispossession and occupation.  "Four
hundred and eighteen living and thriving Palestinian villages were razed
to the ground in 1948 by Zionist perpetrators of myth and crime," Darwish
wrote.

Darwish was born in 1942 in the Arab village of Barweh near Acre in what
is now Israel. His village was destroyed by Israeli troops in the 1948
Middle East war.  Following two years under house arrest, the poet went
into exile in 1970 after he joined the PLO Executive Committee.  An
initial critic of Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking, Darwish quit the PLO
after the first interim agreements were signed in 1993, though he no
longer actively opposes them.  Banned from Israel for 26 years, Darwish
returned from exile in 1996 and settled in the Palestinian-ruled town of
Ramallah in the West Bank. He has published more than two dozen poetry and
prose collections.

Sarid's critics say he intentionally selected Darwish poems without a
hard-line political message for inclusion in the curriculum, thus
misleading students about the nature of the poet's work.  Legislator Benny
Elon of the far-right National Union party, said Sarid's decision was a
sign of weakness. "I think that only a society that wants to commit
suicide would put it in its curriculum," Elon said.

Darwish said Israelis should not fear his poetry.

Noting that as a high school student in Israel, he was forced to read the
works of Haim Bialik, the poetic voice of Zionism, Darwish said Bialik
"did not change me into a Zionist. He did not even get me to like his
poems."

Brian, I agree with you.  So much of these types of power dynamics
are so internalized they're hard to see and even if seen and with the
best intentions, damned near impossible to change.  Most social
change that I see seems to be one group or individual's complaints
about being low on the food chain, and actions are performed to raise
their position on the food chain.  But the food chain itself isn't
questioned.  Or, in your words: idealism followed by an new
totalitarianism.

One topic that interests me that isn't really about
literature--though I would like to see it brought more into
literature (and it is being)--is the terror of the female body.
Men's terror before it and women's terror of their own bodies.  A
sick state of affairs that seems to be getting only sicker.  Is it
despite or because of women's increasing position of power (in
Western society, at least)?  It gets messy as to where anything is
coming from--how to separate cultural images of perfection from one's
internalizations.  Like one can't say, "That Lancome ad makes me hate
myself."  But it is not without impact.  This is just an example.

And one last thing--sometimes people surprise you.  The abject body
is so connected theoretically with the Other, the marginalized.
Definitely not the domain of straight white guys.  But, recently
Taylor Brady sent me an essay that touched upon issues of his
personal sense of physical abjection that was beautifully done.
There was no sense he was trying to co-opt the territory--more of a
sense of a difficult honesty.  Not keeping the subject at a safe
distance, but allowing it to seep into one's private perceptions, to
act as a lens.  Taylor, I hope you're not groaning because I
mentioned you here.

I think that being an arts administrator for 5 years has taken the
fight out of me.  Like you say, I'm more interested these days in
meeting the challenges from within.

Tom Raworth, Tottering State
Selected Early Poems 1963-1983
ISBN: 1--882022--38--6
O Books

Hot on the heals of the American publication of fellow Englishman J.H.
Prynne's Poems is the expanded edition of Raworth's underground classic
selected early poems, originally published by The Figures in 1984.  Ranging
from the author's debut volume, The Relation Ship, to his major long poem
Writing (not included in the original selection), Tottering State is an
colorful, resonantly sunlit window on the work of a writer considered by
many American poets (such as Robert Creeley) as the best living writer in
England. Indeed, the American affinities -- along with echoes of French
poets like Pierre Reverdy -- are most visible in his earlier work.  At times
he seems like a more cerebral, dark version of Berrigan, or maybe a
departure from Ashbery of Some Trees into more formally wilder territories,
but this is never to the detriment of fun, a zen-like openness, and a
English rapier's wit.  His cerebral quality comes through in the precision
in his choice of imagery, his modification of the moods of conversation, and
the surrealist dive into absurdities arriving at just the right moment to
both deepen his sentiment and render it more painterly: "now the pink
stripes, the books, the clothes you wear / in the eaves of houses i ask
whose land it is // an orange the size of a melon rolling slowly across the
field / where i sit at the centre in an upright coffin of five panes of
glass // there is no air        the sun shines / and under me you've planted
a quick growing cactus" (31, sic)  The philosophical underpinnings -- always
that of a layman, never venturing far into "theory" unless it's to present
it as _possible_ in normal conversation -- bubble to the surface of the work
when least expected, as in an anecdote about a child that has eaten green
crayons (which remains -- like a solipsism -- the same green upon reaching
the other end), to the quick-stab poem "Univesity Days," which runs in its
entirety: "[this poem has been removed for further study]".  (76) Nowness,
thisness, hereness, but also you-ness, I-ness and witness, are the axes
around which such linked sequences as "The Conscience of a Conservative,"
revolve, with such choice moments of telescoped, daily life as the
following: "o / hand / make a circle // how / the wound / snaps shut."
(103) In such poems, Raworth seems as full of child-like amazement and
blissful, paratactic perceptions as another New York poet, Joseph Ceravalo,
though he surehandedly connects it to a private/public sense of
responsibility and opinion. In the later work collected in Tottering State,
he seems to have entered adolescence, as the long, slender word streams in
poems such as "That More Simple Natural Time Tone Distortion," push the once
retreating poet into a more directly politicized, consequently more filmic
than painterly, consideration of time.  He almost illustrates Bergson's
once-radical request that we not divide time into weeks and days, but a
slipstream of contingent moments: "slow / low / thump / long flame / dry /
flash bur / just / move / tree browns / to south / our horse / white / no
trace / of action / in memory / and fear / but this / is / clear / this area
/ this never / ending / song / to last / gasp / cold colours / enough /
flashes / to leach him / out" (134).  If such extreme forms suggest a
relationship to the American Language poets, it is there, but that would be
to miss the humanism in Raworth's work, the persona he has unwittingly
created for himself as benevolent, however mischeivous, tourguide to the
hear and now in its many ambivalent (drag) disguises.  Only he shows how
interesting this this this can be.

PinoMURDER's return highlights Chile's painful past, strength of MURDERtary
(for Victor Jara)

SANTIAGO, March 6 (AFP) -

Emotions raised by the return of ex-MURDERman Augusto PinoMURDER highlight
Chile's struggle to come to grips with its painful past, as well as the
strong role still played by the MURDERtary 10 years after the end of
dicMURDERship.

The government says the need to overcome the wounds left by PinoMURDER's
17-year MURDERtary dicMURDERship is the very reason it had pressed for the
return of the general.

"The country cannot deal with a traumatic past through foreign courts," said
a top government official who played a key role in efforts to obtain
PinoMURDER's release from almost 17 months of house arrest in London.

British Home Secretary Jack Straw released PinoMURDER last week, saying he
was unfit to face trial in Spain, where he is charged with torture, but the
84-year-old general could still be prosecuted in Chile, where 61 lawsuits
have been filed against him.

PinoMURDER's 1973-1990 MURDERtary dicMURDERship has been blamed for
thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of cases of torture, and
investigators are still searching for the bodies of people who "disappeared"
at the hands of
PinoMURDER's notorious political police.

His return on Friday stirred up strong emotions in a country that is still
trying to come to grips with the legacy of the dicMURDERship, and where the
government remains concern over the support the ex-MURDERman still enjoys
within the MURDERtary.

The outgoing government of Eduardo Frei, which includes several longtime
foes of PinoMURDER, has sharply criticized the MURDERtary for staging a
welcoming ceremony at Santiago's airport for its former MURDERer-in-chief.

"It was a shameful event that damaged Chile's international image abroad,"
said a top government official who asked not to be named.

"Relations with the arMURDERy are difficult, it is time it got over its
crude cold war idea that, with PinoMURDER, it defeated world communism," he
told journalists.

Keeping these relations from deteriorating further will form a crucial
challenge for the government of Socialist Ricardo Lagos, a longtime
PinoMURDER foe who will be sworn in as president on Saturday.

Lagos himself said last week said his center-left government would strive to
show the world that Chile is a deMURDERcratic country "where the arMURDER
forces are disciplined and obedient" and do not interfere in politics.

"It is time the arMURDERy understands something it has never understood:
that it is subject to political powers and not MURDERtary powers," said
Manuel Antonio Garreton, a political analyst at the University of Chile.

He said the welcoming ceremony at the airport, which he described as "a
MURDERtary invasion," demonstrated the power and independence still enjoyed
by the arMURDER forces 10 years after the end of dicMURDERship.

"The whole thing demonstrates that some sectors of the arMURDER forces still
do what they want," Garreton told AFP.

For Garreton, it was the arMURDER forces that put pressure on the government
to seek PinoMURDER's return, and many believe similar pressure will be
exercised to ensure the ex-dicMURDER never faces a court of law.

Dear David B., Burt, and listmates,

Between the two Poetry New York posts, I'm curious as to what is going on,
although, Burt, you mention you'd rather not detail it here. In light of a
recent thread where a litmag ed wondered if they shd continue publishing and
why, the whys and wherefores of the PNY situation are real relevant to what
goes on in our lit publishing world. (Much of this, I'm sure, will come up
at Issue Zero this weekend and this summer on a publishing panel I'm
organizing for the Third Annual Boston Alternative Poetry Festival.)

As for letting the magazine die, I've always been one who feels he's a
publisher for life, with a constantly evolving vision for my small press. I
started my press doing local authors chapbooks in Albany, progressed to
doing a general interest zine and national authors chapbooks, and have gone
on to instantzines, litzines, postcards, broadsides, audiotapes and more.

Maybe it is time for PNY to die, though only you can make that call. But
that don't mean that there isn't some sort of publishing venture that
perhaps isn't more feasible and reflective of where you're at now.

as ever,
David Kirschenbaum

A week ago I mentioned that a memorial reading for Ed Dorn would take place
in Seattle on Saturday night, March 25, at the Hugo House, 1634 11th Avenue
in the Capitol Hill neighborhood.

(The Hugo House was named after Richard Hugo, a poet who won't ever be
discussed
on this list. But he was a good guy. I met him once; we talked about
baseball).

ANYWAY . . . those of you who WANT to participate in this reading but can't
because of being geographically challenged now have a fall-back option. You
can send a few lines of verse that will be incorporated into a slide show --
a "silent open mike" -- that will precede the reading itself. Here are the
instructions, from "DJ Yum Yum" . . .

"Send yr text to subslideshow@hotmail.com -- no formatting of the text is
necessary.  You can just send it in a regular e-mail message. In order for
the text to fit (and to be reasonably read) on a slide it should be less
than 18 lines long. Please include *Slides for Dorn* in the subject line."

Although the DJ says 18 lines, I'd think eight or less might work a lot
better; however, send what you will. The slides will be accompanied, for
about 20 minutes or so, by a yet-to-be-determined sound mix (including,
but not limited to, some of the bad country music that Ed liked so well).

Thanks! I hope to see you there, either in person or by proxy.

the media sweeps more bush info under the rug...

(apologies for cross posting)

 Subject:       White Only Clause - Please Read


I don’t know how accurate that was, but it’s very
disturbing, being that this is the second time TODAY,
that I’ve read about Bush, and what he thinks of
Blacks. I don’t know how many of you are stationed in
Europe, but in February 15th’s edition of Stars and
Stripes it’s talking about his reaction to the
dragging death of James Byrd Jr. This man’s family
was pushing for a hate crime law in Texas, and Bush
made it clear that the bill was not to reach his desk.
Even though he was the state governor at the time, he
didn’t even have the decency to acknowledge such a
horrific act committed in his very own state. Some
very high profile individuals attended the funeral,
and it was very inappropriate for the state governor
to
ignore this, and not attend. When the victim’s
daughter, 4 months pregnant, bleeding, and on the
verge of miscarriage flew from Hawaii, to Texas
for a long sought after meeting, he kept the meeting
to 10 minutes. He never shook her hand, offered her a
tissue, a glass or water, or even sympathized
with the family for what they’ve gone through. She
asked him about the hate crimes bill, and he admitted
“he hadn’t had time to review it”. So
she pulled a copy out and laid it on his desk. He
didn’t even pick it up.  Come on yall, is this who we
want leading our country, or our ARMED FORCES???!!!!
Someone who regards Blacks as second class citizens,
and doesn’t even try to hide it? I want you all to
think real hard about this one. And remember, NOT
voting can have the same effect as voting FOR him. 1
LUV .................
FYI  This is a must see!
Your possible future President refused to sell his
home to  Blacks.  This must be passed to any  and
everyone.  Brothers and Sisters, Please read and pass
along. We must remember this at the polls, and choose
wisely.  Subject:   Bush sold his home with a “white
only” clause in the contract. Whites-only covenant
shows Bush’s true colors.
Texas governor and Republican presidential
candidate,George W. Bush recently sent waves through
the black community following a discovery
that a Dallas house he sold in 1995 carries a racial
covenant, which restricts the  sale of  the house to
white people only.
Bush and his wife, Laura, bought the house in 1988.
How is this legal?
It isn’t. The Fair Housing Act  prevents the
enforcement
of racial
covenants.  However, many houses still carry them as a
remnant of  the
Jim Crow era when it was common practice to  exclude
blacks from buying houses and living in white
neighborhoods.
The Bush campaign responded with a one-line statement
saying that the
racial covenant was void and that Bush  was unaware of
it
when he sold
the house.  Yeah right! It’s extremely irresponsible
for a public figure to accidentally overlook such a
stipulation.
Did Bush really know but just didn’t care to do
anything
about it?  The
real estate agent who prepared the papers for the sale
said that she
notified Bush of the racial  covenant but that he
signed the papers anyway.
Perhaps equally shocking as the racial covenant is the
fact that the
media has swept this story under the rug.  Have you
heard
about it in
any of the newspapers you read or on any of the news
programs you
watch?  Do you give Bush the benefit of the doubt?
&#61623; Was he unaware of the racial covenant during
the time
he and his
family lived in the house or did  he know and decide
that
it wasn’t
worth having ?*  Should HUD initiate a law that
requires all homeowners to wipe racial covenants from
their deeds?
&#61623; Did the media deliberately fail to cover this
story?  Do
you think it would have been handled differently if a
similar story was revealed about a black candidate?
If you  know anyone who believes they may have been a
victim  of housing
discrimination, encourage them to file a  complaint
with
the Department
of Housing and Urban Development at 800-669-9777.

Re: terror of the female body: I read this book years ago--it gave me
nightmares:

Male Fantasies : Women, Floods, Bodies, History
by Klaus Theweleit

From the amazon.com review:

...males construct a "body armor" within which are contained such "female"
traits and emotions (unaknowledged) as weakness, fear, guilt, etc. Through
repetitive conditioning and a brutal pedagogy, these negative, shadowy
perceptions are then projected outward onto the despised classes of scoiety
and made to represent the chaotic forces of the collective cultural
unconscious.

Nazi Bar in Seoul Provokes Anger

 By KYONG-HWA SEOK=
Associated Press Writer=
    SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Nazi flags emblazoned with swastikas
hang from the ceiling and photographs of Adolf Hitler adorn the
walls, along with Nazi propaganda posters and military insignia.
    It is all part of the theme of a bar named ``Jae3JaeGuk,''
(pronounced J-sahm-J-cook), or The Third Reich, located in
Shinchon, a busy commercial district in downtown Seoul.
    There, young South Koreans frolic in dim light, sipping a rum
cocktail named ``Adolf Hitler'' that is served by waiters and
waitresses wearing mock black Nazi uniforms.
    ``There is nothing political about the bar. I only want to
attract people's attention for business,'' said Hyun sae-woog, who
opened the place a year ago.
    In an interview late Monday, Hyun said he does not support
Hitler. His knowledge of the Nazi leader is limited to the
``killing of some Jews.''
    But the presence of the bar _ which has provoked angry protests
from Israeli officials and a Jewish group _ appears to be another
indication of how little some Asians know about the scale of the
atrocities the Nazis committed against Jews during World War II.
    For example, in Taiwan, the owners of a restaurant that had
decorated its walls with pictures of Nazi death camps removed them
in January, shortly after The Associated Press reported that Jewish
and German residents considered the decor offensive.
    The owners of ``The Jail'' restaurant in Taipei said they did
not realize the images might offend some customers.
    In addition, a trading company selling German-made electric
heaters designed a cartoon caricature of Hitler for ads in buses,
store windows and subway stations throughout Taipei. The posters
were immediately taken down last year after Jewish and German
residents complained.
    Like Taiwan, most South Koreans can describe in great detail the
massacres and other atrocities committed by Japanese troops who
controlled Taiwan, parts of China and the Korean peninsula during
World War II. But many understand little about what happened in
Europe during the war, including the Holocaust.
    Only 1,500 Germans and fewer than 100 Israelis live in South
Korea, and that might be one reason why The Third Reich bar has
attracted little media attention.
    Seoul also is filled with many bars, and the Third Reich isn't
the first one to arrange its decor according to a controversial
theme.
    In 1987, a bar called ``Gestapo'' near a U.S. Army base in
downtown Seoul changed its name after complaints by the German
Embassy and pressure by the Seoul government.
    But the Third Reich didn't draw attention until last month, when
the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a prominent Jewish human rights
organization based in Los Angeles, said that it wanted the bar
closed, calling it a ``virtual shrine to Adolf Hitler and Nazism.''
    ``The open existence of such an establishment mocks the memory
of millions of victims of Nazism,'' the center said in a Feb. 28
letter to Lee Hong-koo, South Korea's ambassador to the United
States.
    The Israeli Embassy in Seoul also sent a protest letter to the
South Korean government in February. ``We are very disturbed. We
would prefer if the bar used a better example of history as its
theme,'' said First Secretary Ariel Shafransky at the Israeli
Embassy.
    Officials at the German Embassy in Seoul agreed.
    ``I would like to highlight how intolerable it is, not only for
the German government but also for all the others, especially
Israelis,'' said Oliver Schramm, a German Embassy counselor.
    Officials at South Korea's Foreign Ministry declined to comment.
However, Hyun said government officials visited him twice to try to
persuade him to change the bar's name and decorations.
    He said he is considering ``making some changes,'' but does not
understand why his bar is causing so much controversy.
    Local government officials said there is no legal ground for
them to crack down on the bar. The use of Nazi symbols is illegal
in Germany, but not in South Korea.
    ``We went there twice and appealed to the owner to remove the
Nazi flags and photos, saying it could cause a diplomatic problem.
We got a positive response,'' said Yoo Myong-yeol, a local
government official.
    Customers' reactions vary.
    ``This is a well-designed bar. The colors match, and the music
is good. That's all I care about,'' said Yo Sung-kwan, 25, a design
student who was at the bar Monday night.
    But Hyun admitted that some customers, especially Western
students from nearby universities, occasionally come to protest.
    ``They've sometimes made scenes. So, I decided not to take
foreign customers anymore,'' he sai

". . . The _indian_ is a media simulation, an absence, not a presence or
resistance, and while simulations hold court in popular culture they have
never amounted to much as a native connection or constituency.  Natives are
storiers, and humor is a touchstone of native presence. . . . The best
native stories are not about victimry."

(from Postindian Conversations, "Visionary Sovereignty," University of
Nebraska, 1999)

GERALD VIZENOR, it should be evident, is one of America's most
multi-faceted and prolific writers, and a major thinker of contemporary
Native American life in all its difference and complexity.  *
Internationally renowned for his works on"postindian" writing and culture,
he has written autobiographies (Interior Landscapes), histories (The People
Named the Chippewa), works of literary and cultural theory (Fugitive
Poses), besides compiling anthologies and authoring several novels, among
these American Book Award Winner, Griever:  An American Monkey King in
China.  *  His newest novel, Chancers, is due later this year, from
Oklahoma.  *  Postindian Conversations is also new, from Nebraska-based on
a remarkable series of interviews with A. Robert Lee, and exploring the
vast areas mapped out by Vizenor's work over the past decades.  *

Which brings up another issue: what would an "embodied poetics" look like?
I'd be very interested in what folks have to say, can imagine lots of
mutually incompatible possibilities.

Karen,

I came across this book when I was reading about serial killers last
year--and it did sound interesting but so creepy I didn't check it
out.

Thanks for bringing it up again.

Or lots of possibilities, you could go from Olson to avatars - anyone on a
MOO or MUD is working within embodied poetics - I've used the term "wryt-
ing" to describe the wavering of ontologies in cyberspace. The embodiment
isn't literal of course, but to the extent that the body acts/desires,
these appear directly - the action paralleled by online performatives con-
trolled by the body, as well as, say in ytalk or icq, the literal repre-
sentation (iconic) of the occurring of writing. Desire appears in numerous
ways, through lag to ytalk/icq backtracking, to hypertext (and other)
choices to literal representations of the body in cuseeme; it's almost as
if poetics becomes auratic, a presencing or configuration of styles and
contents, in cyberspace - as if within the plane of the virtual (or bits
and bytes) language/coding take on increasing aspects of the real - alan -

David et al.,

The reasons why PNY may end its present incarnation (there was an earlier
Poetry New York edited by Harvey Shapiro begun in the late 40s and this was
where Olson published "Projective Verse" but there are many other now famous
moments in that journal's run of issues) do not have to do with the
sellability of the paper lit mag. I had a conversation yesterday with Faye
Kosmidis who runs DeBoer Distribution; she said that mags are not doing as
well as they were--but there are exceptions to this rule too such as one she
mentioned whose editor, also a novelist whose recent book got reviewed a
bit, was recently featured on a TV show.  PNY, if it will continue, will do
so probably not with the expectation that it will break even financially
although it might do so if it were terribly stripped down (the new issue,
for instance, aside from the fine verse in it, has amazing images by Basil
King that simply require color--and even if the images were shown on the
Internet, they would not look the same, which is not to say they would look
bad, or do the same things for us as they would in a physical book on
physical paper). These are the wages of our time--can't live with the paper
mag, can't live without it.

The changes regarding PNY have nothing to do with the changing market. I
didn't want the changes to occur. Enough said.

Subject: What becomes a small press? PNY queries


Dear David B., Burt, and listmates,

Between the two Poetry New York posts, I'm curious as to what is going on,
although, Burt, you mention you'd rather not detail it here. In light of a
recent thread where a litmag ed wondered if they shd continue publishing and
why, the whys and wherefores of the PNY situation are real relevant to what
goes on in our lit publishing world. (Much of this, I'm sure, will come up
at Issue Zero this weekend and this summer on a publishing panel I'm
organizing for the Third Annual Boston Alternative Poetry Festival.)

As for letting the magazine die, I've always been one who feels he's a
publisher for life, with a constantly evolving vision for my small press. I
started my press doing local authors chapbooks in Albany, progressed to
doing a general interest zine and national authors chapbooks, and have gone
on to instantzines, litzines, postcards, broadsides, audiotapes and more.

Maybe it is time for PNY to die, though only you can make that call. But
that don't mean that there isn't some sort of publishing venture that
perhaps isn't more feasible and reflective of where you're at now.

as ever,
David Kirschenbaum

Perhaps you=B9re right that one can=B9t say "that Lancome ad makes me hate
myself," but I think one might be able to say "that Lancome ad is a
distorted projection of the female body siphoned through the culturally
installed lens of a male gaze," or something vaguely similar. Am I getting
too old school? I'm digging back to theorists like Mulvey re: cinema, but I
think the same ideas can be easily extended to other cultural production
like print media (gawd, look at Cosmo for crissakes! Or any women=B9s
=8Clifestyle=B9 or =8Cfashion=B9 magazine, for that matter. These are supposed to b=
e
FOR WOMEN?). I don=B9t think it would be a huge leap to argue that the male
gaze -- the conception of male positioned as spectator of the female -- is
woven into the very matrix of female representation within (Western)
culture, including (perhaps especially, as they are whoring -- err, I mean,
=8Cselling,=B9 after all) representational conventions in magazine adverts and
the like. Even the most cursory glance at most glossy print mags serves to
underscore the idea that nearly all images of the female body are explicitl=
y
constructed -- sexualized, =8Cperfected=B9 (and by perfected I mean the
demographically average, usually white, certainly heterosexual male=B9s idea
of the physically ideal female...which is not to say that this ideal was no=
t
foisted on him/them as it has been on all of us) -- in order to conform to
the prescribed male gaze as a kind of =8Cdefault=B9 position, a naturalized
framework upon which nearly all commercially produced images of the female
body are assembled. And, of course, ala Mulvey, this framework is a prison
-- a method of containing/controlling what Dodie rightly calls the male
terror of the female body. And perhaps the (as it seems at least to me)
mach-speed increase in graphically sexualized and reductive/reducing
representations of female body in mags & their ads of late (the whole waif
thing could be a topic in and of itself; =8Cheroin chic,=B9 in which women are
posed as half-dead, unconscious, catatonic, etc. (see: ravished, willing,
submissive?)) could be seen as an (over)reaction to women=B9s increasing, and
potentially threatening, power?

Perhaps I=B9m overstating/simplifying, and I realize that I could get into a
lot of trouble here on the list so I=B9ll stop. But certainly, if even partly
true, the above would certainly help explain why it is that representations
of the female body that refuse to subscribe to the tenants of this framewor=
k
(that attempt to represent more =8Crealistic=B9 or =8Caverage=B9 female bodies)
consistently meet enormous resistance, particularly from males.

But I could be totally wrong here.

Clearly enjoying my first post,

The key text here with Olson would probably Proprioception, a digging in to
understand body, soul, word -- all as physical, thus making a continuity
among them and from them to place, geography, etc. Not so much
representations of one's body, as a sense of everything as 'body.'

Nice post, Don.  it's hard to imagine embodied postics discused on this
list by males,  but I think it's worth a try.

I'll try to put something together later, but wanted to mentiion that
I'm planning on starting a print/web journal and press called _Repo
Repro_.  Focus of the journal/press? will be on embodied poetry and
poetics and differences/similarities between web and print publication.
The first piece is up at
http://sites.netscape.net/trbell/RepoRepro/listenan.htm
Let us repo our bodies and repro them.

My piece of course, but I am interested in submissions and ideas.  The
Repro (xeroxed, acctually) version of this (Listening to Rain) is
available for $2.50 ppd from me c/o Repo Repro, 2518 Wellington Pl.,
Murfreesboro, TN 37128.

I wouldn't mind a report on this panel, either--ought to be good for a
few laughs.  Thinking about it, I started wondering again about today's
poetry critics.  The very few that are published in periodicals with
circulations of more than a few hundred deal with dead poetry only, so
far as I can tell.  But what do I know?  Which leads to a suggestion:
that some dedicated soul gather a list of poetry critics active in this
country, and tell where they're being published and what kind of poetry
they're discussing.  I wish I had time to do it myself.  Actually, one
of the hopes I had for my website was to form a gallery of poetry
critics.  I got some material from two or three poet/critics, and some
bios of poet/critics for my bio section but little else.  And the
website went into the null zone due to lack of public interest--and
laziness on my part.  Although it is still out there, and I do hope to
add to it one of these days.

I might note, too, that I suggested to an editor of that annual Poets &
Writers compilation of poets and fiction writers that they add critics
but she felt it'd be too much work.  Apparently they are under-staffed.

I believe we have way too many poets and way too few critics.  And
vastly too little real poetry criticism--and not even ample reviews of
poetry.

Tension denied recoils, coils on itself
All those 350hp torque to finish first.

Where better to start than Artaud:

     "muscles twisted, as if flayed, the sense of being made of glass
and breakable, a fear, a recoiling from movement and noise.  An
unconscious confusion in walking, gestures, movements.  A will
that is perpetually strained to make the simplest gestures.
     renunciation of the simple gesture,
     a staggering and central fatigue...", "Description of a Physical
State"
or
Kristeva:
"A subject of this type crosses through the linguistic network and makes
use of it to indicate, as if via anaphora or hieroglyphs, that he or she
is not representing a reality posed in advance and for ever detached
from the pulsational process, but that he or she is experimenting or
using the objective process through immersion in it and re-emerging from
it via the drives." "The Subject in Process'

or someone as passe as Jackson Pollack?

I.m not defending the male gaze which is responsible for a lot, but I
think that when you atlk about ads in glossy fashion magazines you are
talking about the female constrution of the male gaze

Subject:      More on Klaus Theweleit (was re: gender)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Karen, Dodie, et al.,

I was going to mention Theweleit's book MALE FANTASIES (2 vol., Minnesota
UP, still in print, translated from German, intro. to vol. 1 by the
always-awesome Barbara Ehrenreich) in response to Dodie's post, so thanks
Karen for bringing it up even sooner! Below is a mini-synopsis for those
who don't know this important, politically interesting, personally
interesting, and *poetically* interesting book.

ALSO, Theweleit himself is giving the keynote talk at a German Studies
conference at UC Berkeley this Saturday at 2:10 -- backchannel me if you
want directions.

MALE FANTASIES started as Theweleit's doctoral dissertation from the early
1970s, but from the beginning it was a protest -- common throughout Germany
in the 1960s -- against the silence of the older generation concerning the
nazi past. In Theweleit's case (as in many other cases), the protest had
formal as well as content-based features: epigraphs from Jimi Hendrix and
Bob Dylan, lots of short chapters, a thoroughly nonacademic style, a brief
autobiographical introduction (on how beatings at the hands of his father
were "his first lesson in fascism" and his mother's silence was his "second
lesson in fascism"), and, perhaps most interestingly, hundreds of visual
elements -- old postcards, cartoons, comic strips, propaganda posters,
other mostly pop-cultural ephemera -- interspersed throughout the book.
These are not illustrations, and are mostly not discussed in the text, but
serve as a kind of counterpoint and generalization to whatever he is
discussing.

The aspect of generalization is important because, even though he mostly
discusses a specific set of texts (see below), he is trying to offer (as
the title suggests) a psychoanalysis of Masculinity as such (at least in
"our" culture). So all the broad pop-cultural examples which resonate with
his points implicitly argue that what he discusses is *everywhere*.

His specific "sample" are writings by and about the Freikorps: German
military and paramilitary groups from between the World Wars which came out
of the defeated WWI armies, grew into a core constituency of the SS, and
spent the intervening years doing things like going around breaking
strikes, killing communists, etc. A bunch of them also kept diaries or
wrote novels, and there are a bunch of novels from the period about them
(i.e. heroicizing them as the stalwart bastions against communists, women,
liberals, "softness," etc.). Theweleit analyzes some key formulaic features
of this body of literature -- men and their horses, communist nurses with
weapons hidden under their skirts who almost kill the hero before he
realizes their threat and blows the nurses up in time, fear of
water/floods/mud/swamps/women, etc.etc.etc. Vol. 1 of MALE FANTASIES
basically covers what these texts construe as threats, vol. 2 covers the
corresponding self-representations ("steel-blue eyes," goosestep marches,
whiteness, etc.etc.).

Because Theweleit can plausibly view the texts he discusses as "formulaic"
and "nonliterary" (for every example he gives, there are dozens of other
identical examples (or so he says (but I believe him))), he is ultimately
able to use literature to give a psychoanalysis of the culture without
having to deal with the problem of the relationship BETWEEN literature and
culture. (I.e., he sees these books as symptoms, not literary
representations and manipulated constructions, of cultural phenomena.)
(Compare, say, Faulkner, where it's harder to say whether he's brilliantly
perceiving, analyzing, anatomizing, and presenting to the reader his
culture's misogyny/racism/whatever, or whether he's simply exhibiting his
own misogyny/racism/whatever in a particularly over-the-top way.)

Anyway, great book. (How many people do *you* know whose dissertations have
been translated, introduced by Barbara Ehrenreich, or are still in print 30
years later?)

One of the most moving lines of poetry I know is Whitman's description of
his genitalia as "Root of wash'd sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of
guarded duplicate eggs!" It's not that I'm into pond-snipe or exclamation
marks per se, but how amazing for a man in "our" culture to be able to look
at himself like that! How far I am from that kind of relationship to my
body, or to other men's bodies; or to women's bodies, for different reasons
(including an awareness of gender issues and a [perhaps
liberal-guilt-induced] discomfort with the idea of viewing women's bodies
in that way [though I don't even really know what "that way" means --
Whitman's description doesn't seem, say, "objectifying"]).

Of course I, as a man in my culture, didn't really get it, until a (female)
teacher of mine said: "What an incredible line -- how amazing for a man in
our culture to be able to look at himself like that!"

In other words, I'm not sure it's only the *abject* body which (in Dodie's
words)

>is so connected theoretically with the Other, the marginalized.
>Definitely not the domain of straight white guys.

So go Taylor Brady!

Tracy,

Welcome to the bullpit.  What you write above reminds me of something
Naomi Wolf writes in *The Beauty Myth* re: the male gaze and gendered
body types:  fat men are fat gods.  One of Wolf's main arguments is
that the plummeting weight of models/cultural representations of the
idealized female body is a response to feminist gains.  The body as a
site of social control.  I know that Wolf is pop and has been
criticized but I think lots of what she says in that book makes
sense.  I particularly like her comparisons of beauty rituals with
religious rituals.

On a more academic note, I just got Susan Bordo's *Unbearable Weight:
Feminism, Western Culture and the Body."  I've just had time to dip
into it, but looks good.  It includes her anthologized essay "Reading
the Slender Body," plus a thoughtful examination of postmodern
feminist critiques of the totalitarian undercurrents of much feminist
thought, and a reading of the social construction of the eating
disorders as a category/categories.  A very readable book.  You can
have your Foucault and eat it too.

Yes, let me second the request for a report.  I've always sort of
thought of Vendler and Perloff as matter and antimatter, academically
speaking, and have sometimes found myself idly imagining what would
happen if they

FILMS AND DETRITUS FROM OUTHOUSE

FILMS (by Artist)

Alcola, Angel
"Fluff," 1990 16mm film, color/B&W/sound 6.5 minutes, $16
Rotating bits of fluff. A mobius strip for the mind. Memory meets
multilayered monotony. Six minutes expand to seemingly endless ("boundless")
Time.

Baskin, Rolf
"It (You) Was (S/he): or 'I' Rhymes with 'Eye,' Doesn't It?" 1989, 16mm, 5
min., b&w, $5
Baskin threaded various lengths of found film through an old arts
administrator.

Connover, Stephanie
"Mountain View?" 1997 (super 8) 3 minutes, $7
Shot in Mountain View, California, this is a montage film that expresses a
connection between Connover and the suburban landscape of northern
California. The impotence of natural rhythm is exploited and convoluted
through camera and editing techniques. It incorporates two shots of found
footage plus manipulations such as scrunching, punting, pinking and "yelling
at." This film features Stockard Ruhbard.

Dickles, William
"Serial Metabolism," 1984-1986, 16mm, color/so, 20m, $25
An examination of the American nude lifestyle. "William Dickles is a
masterful film editor. His sensitivity to nudity is exuberant and
refreshing. He is skillful not only in manipulating the flow of images but
the flow of ideas as well. This fusing of naked people and waking
consciousness creates the magic of SERIAL METABOLISM "-Bruce Bobin,
Associate Curator of Film, Whitter's Museum of American Art

Hubble, Heni
"MEMO MOTION," 1995, 16mm cinemascope, color, sound, 17 min., $32
Winner -- 1995 Hamburger Film Festival Short Film Jury Gorgonzola Award
Memo Motion tells about death -- not as a visual gag, but as a necessary
means to communicate visual motives. One thinks of a still life, or a woman
cleaning a room, not -- as is common in contemporary filmmaking -- metaphors
and symbols. There we are, where we started: death. -- Stefan Haupt-Ruggles

Mankus, Nona
"Magnolia Vitrino's Bloody Salt Diamond Machine," 1986, 16mm, color, sound,
35 min. $76
The inner life of a prostitute imprisoned for killing an alienated black
jack dealer devolves into an "energy field" of harrowing hallucinatory
desolation and violence. Kelley Thomas of the San Diego Observer called it
"Brilliant...an awe-inspiring work of art of the highest level; one of the
year's top five films."

Smith, Oliver
"Orient on Fire!," 1971 B&W 48 minutes, $150
In this, his best known film, exotic characters cavort in a
quasi-documentary of flaccid penises and bouncing breasts. The work's coda,
however, is devoid of any sign of human presence. Abstract, hand-manipulated
flutters.


DETRITUS

Ann Papy Sprocket Enlargements
Prices start at $2,000 each.
Signed and numbered by the artist.

Jon Metier Frozen Vegetables
Prices start at $300 each.
"These vegetables are from my films. But they are no longer my vegetables.
At the same time, they are frozen. What are they, then? They are my
obsessions. I got obsessed with the possibilities of frozen vegetables. It
began as a chance curiosity and then became an obsession. I don't really
know what these vegetables are. But I recognize them as vegetables. And I
like seeing them again, these vegetables, frozen, like memories."

Flaxusfluff
Prices start at $125 each.
Signed lint and fluff bits from Flaxus founders Geog Freres, Yimiko Kazua,
Michel Tries, Alecsandre Alexus, et al.

ABOUT SPIRAL Q:

Spiral Q Puppet Theater began as a small volunteer initiative in 1996 to use

the language of puppetry to communicate and bring visibility to important

AIDS and health issues.  Local activist and artist Matthew (Mattyboy) Hart

and other like-minded individuals began exploring the historical use of

giant puppets, banners and street theater as important aspects of civic

demonstrations, helping to communicate the people's message.  Since then

Spiral Q has evolved into a full-time community arts organization.


Spiral Q Puppet Theater seeks to mobilize communities, empower working peopl=

(variously cross-posted: apologies to anyone who has
to read this more than once)

Inside the West there are enlightenment ideals of
progress and emancipation, and although everything
isn't perfect just yet, everything is getting better
all the time. _Les choses sont avec nous_.

Outside the West there is footbinding and genital
mutilation, and the only way things ever get better is
if the Western people make the non-Western people try
to be more like them. _Les choses sont contre vous_.

You will be sorry if you try to leave the West. Where
will you go? To the places where there is
widow-burning and female infanticide and dreadful
poverty. To the places where there are death squads
and corrupt politicians and men whose heads do grow
beneath their shoulders. You will be sorry if you go
to the places where there are machetes and machine
guns and helicopter gunships from the West. You will
be sorry if
you go to the places where there is no clean water and
there are terrible diseases and everybody tries to
give you AIDS.

You must say: I do not want your dreadful diseases.
You must say: I do not want to buy a politician. You
must say: I did not pay for this helicopter gunship.

You will be sorry if we have to drop some napalm on
you. You will be sorry if you make us put some nerve
gas in your air. You will be sorry if you do not
overthrow your corrupt politicians. You must say: I
did
not mean to invade that country. You must say: the
corrupt politicians are torturing me. You must say: I
am a premature baby, I am a woman in a headscarf, I am
a dissident intellectual.

You will be sorry if you try to leave the non-West.
They will not let you leave! And if they do let you
leave, the West will not let you come in! But you must
let the West come in. The West can go everywhere. The
West already is everywhere, like cowshit.com in
Calcutta.

You are not sorry enough, but you will be. You are not
premature enough. You have not been tortured enough.
You may be a dissident, but what's this about being an
intellectual? Your stories are all lies. You do not
come from where you say you come from. You did not see
the things you say you saw. Those were not our
helicopter gunships, those were not our
corrupt politicians. Go back to where you came from.
Go back to the places where there is foot-burning and
dreadful infanticide. _Les choses sont contre vous_. I
am sorry but that is how it is, objectively: there
is no other way that it is. This is reality for me and
reality for you. Reality for me is helicopter
gunships. Reality for you is dreadful diseases. This
is objective. Go back. Your stories are all AIDS and
premature babies. You have not been objective enough. Go.

Subject:      an amazing book I just discovered!!! (review!!!)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

---



A review of an interesting book of philosophy!!!


"Nous avons ecrit _l'Anti-Oedipe_ a deux." Thus begins Gilles Deleuze's
and Felix Guattari's Capitalisme et Schizophrenie, Mille Plateaux. This
book is a godsend to organization, even though the "a deux" seems to imply
rhizomatic thinking from the very beginning. Well, this form of thinking
has been around for millennia - for a good example, see Genesis which was
written by a number of people at different times interspersing comment-
aries and texts among each other. And you don't have to look any farther
than Herry Lovelich's Holy Grail materials to see how the middle ages
tended to mix things up. Or think about all the quotes in Heian literat-
ure, which makes a lot of it seem like a group read if not a group rite.
But what can we say about an Oedipal smearing among two men? Was either
the father to the other? That would take some doing to investigate. In-
stead I want to concentrate on the "avons" of task completion; there were
so many smaller texts, that this use of the tense seems to imply that
things were already done and it's time to move on, but is it? One thing
about the book is all the terms they introduce, which really does create
a sense of belonging among believing readers, as well as a kind of trans-
lation from ordinary english; while "collaboration" does not imply "rhizo-
matic" for example, if you combine it with Koestler's "holarchy" or Bohm's
"implicate order" you get some of the same. And yet it's rhizome here and
rhizome there, for people who have never dug kudzu out of the ground, or
don't even know what it is. You can hardly kill it; gasoline or other pen-
etrants do it best, but at what cost to the environment? Like everything
else, spread is not necessarily a good thing - mafias and their interre-
lationships are rhizomatic in a bad sense, for example, exfoliating like
wildfires around the world. I can imagine a thousand plateaus, like the
Argentinian pampas, with rhizomes growing between the surface - Hakim Bey
might have something to say about that. But it's the universalism of the
royal "Nous" that gets me, even though there are two authors - on one hand
it sounds really democratic - "all of us did this or that" - but on the
other, that "avons" gets us back to, well, "our" accomplishments in pro-
ducing a best-seller, which, everyone knows, had something or other to do
with Situationism, may 68, Leotard's Libidinal Economy, the New Philoso-
phers, and incipient Baudrillardism which strikes post-McLuhanist blows in
the guise of ignorance about America. That's really great - what if, for
example, Shirley MacLaine had written the "Nous" since she channels and
has probably out-rhizomed just about anyone? I love the way my heart pumps
blood into my veins.

There's always more to "chew on" re: women/food/eating disorders. Anorexia
used to primarily be a disease of class-privileged white women -- "you can
never be too rich or too thin."  Yet idealized body types vary widely among
communities, often along race & class lines (though the dominant culture's
Barbie affects everyone: white, thin, blond, "clean"). Horrifying to me how
anorexia and bulimia are increasingly cropping up in other communities, such
as among African-American women. Then there's always the pairing of
"fatness" with "laziness." How many times have you heard someone throw out
the phrase "fat & lazy" ? This is a class construct; again: never too rich,
never too thin. Yet if we're going to put some of culpability of this onto
men, and the "male gaze," the male gaze is not monolithic. In Black
communities, working class communities, Latino communities, etc. differing
standards abound. It's always fascinating to me how my body is read as
"text" in street-level kinds of interactions. This has to do with race and
gender, yes, but also with body type.

Women in the West, like their sisters in North Africa, eat 1/10 the
calories of their male counterparts. Maybe the hungry woman who is not
from the West is self-sacrificing for altruistic purposes. Dieting as
back lash according to Faludi. Sadism seems global.

Learned today that as many as 200 of the high school students in my
charming New England town are homeless. Considering the scopeof
homelessness,we have an internal refugeeproblem in New Hampshire.

Tom Bell wrote that the male gaze with reference to glam mags is a
female construction. You have to go one more step to be clear on this:
every woman carries within her a surveyor (censor) who is male (John
Berger). A woman's appearance determines what kind of access a man may
have to her body. This is a societal construction of gender, not
something that women have contrived for their own convenience. Evidence
of patriarchy, evidence of sadism all around us. That is why I think we
have to deal with this thread as male straight, female straight, gay,
lesbian, bisexual (3 or 4 varieties), intersexual (as many as 7
varieties I have heard).

Berger also offered something about
'subjectivity+objectivity+subjectivity' as a formula that allows us to
deal with our everyday nakedness, subjectivity twice-removed. Oh it is
all so dated, 1968 I think. Someone like Lynda Nead or Caroline
Schneeman (one of those on whom Nead models her thoughts) seems to have
pushed much further than Berger.

My point is that there is much more going on than a level of whining
distinctive of the west. What is happening everywhere has to be dealt
with if one wants an embodied poetics. The ritualized forms of an
embodied poetics in Africa and in the west can be gruesome. And what I
have most wanted to say is that we can't transcend this gruesomeness or
people's reactions to it, but if the subject does count for a poetics,
it is as part of the stuff that has to be objectified if the subject
wants to view his her own nakedness. Thanks Tom Bell for the Kristeva
quote that says this better than I have.

By the way my own subjectivity floats all over the place--so I wonder
how many differently embodied voices I might possibly claim as mine,
even if only incidentally. This is related to how the tongue, the foot,
and the breath are embodied in the line, but also to how certain glows
and pains register there.

This idea of "starting from," be it Olson or Artaud, seems like a very odd
concept to me. It seems that one of the most profound things we all have to
deal with is how it always predates us, is there always already in the only
way that phrase can really mean something: watch how little girls and boys
code it (or "miscode" it) over and over.

But if I had to "start from" an author in thinking about this, I'd pick The
Psychoanalysis of Edward the Dyke by Judy Grahn.

And I too would love to hear reports of the Vendler/Perloff et al
discussion. In fact, a full-length video clip up on EPC would definitely get
downloaded by yours truly if it were to be made available....

I'm in the process of putting together a website for TPS (Tufts Poets

poetry links I might use.  I, of course, could do searches, but this
seemed much easier.
I am particularly looking for:

1) archives of "classic" poems (really...anything that's been in print
for more than five years would be lovely

2) biographical sites concentrating on poets or poetry sites with
biographical information

3) magazines (electronic or paper)

4) places in the Boston area that hold readings or support poetry or are
of importance historically...ranging from the Grolier to Walden to
Lizzard Lounge, etc. (none of which I have links for)

5) individual Boston area poets

6) any other unique sites that might spark something

Thanks so much,
j

Hey I'm singing back-up on a couple of songs with Stephan Smith & the
Apocalyptic Jubilee Band making it's cosmic debut:


     This Monday, March 13th at the Living Room,10:30 p.m.!
     corner of Stanton and Allen, 533-7235

Ladies and Gentleman, you are cordially invited to a one time, live
rehearsal, first ever public performance of the band that gets you UP and
in the Movement: Stephan Smith and The Apocalyptic Jubilee Band are
finishing their deep funking, harder than rocking, softer than rainfall,
and more pointed than an arrow debut album of songs that threaten to break
the cycles of history and make the deaf dance, the blind sing, and the
violent roll around with their bellies up begging to be tickled with the
only peace on earth, the banging banging beat of the Apocalyptic Jubilee.
And, they're coming to your neighborhood this Monday.

Starring all you who come and shake your world turning freedom machines, and:
Mary "So Very" Harris, straight from Ruffhouse Records (fugees, nas, lauryn
hill), Spearhead, Macy Gray, Fishbone and Weapon of Choice, on the drums
and vocals like no one since Billy Holiday
Sharief "Ali" Hobley, the universal funkmaster, stamen of the Black Lily,
the Roots' Motive Record camp and Chocalate Genius, on elextric guitar,
keyboard, bass and vocals
Andrew Weiss, the one and only bass-o-sauraus from WEEN, Yoko Ono,
Butthole Surfers and countless others, on samples, noise, bass and waste

And last but not least, your bonafide Intergalactic Peckerwood, Stephan
"Said " Smith on Vocals, guitars, synthesizers, bass, banjo, harmonicas,
violins and various other friendly noize machines.
Bring the whole family to this bodacious and unforgettable, first and only
first night out but get there early if you want to be close!

FOLLOWING MESSAGE JUST CAME IN FROM JOEL CLIMENHAGA:

Wednesday, March 8, 2000


Dear Good People:

Miriam Patchen died this past Monday.
Jonathan Clark found her today

She had been sitting in a chair reading her mail, so her
dying was peaceful

Undoubtedly there will be arrangements for some
sort of memorial service in her memory sometime down the
line

If you'd like to have more information about all that, let me
know

In the meantime, send the news to anyone you think
would be interested in knowing of her death

 [I've called a number of
people already

Even so, don't hesitate to send the news to
 anyone you think might be interested.]


 Joel Climenhaga

Some Critics
(off the top o' my head)
who write about 20th C. poetry/poetics in interesting and well-circulated
(well, at least available) pubs:
Aldon Nielsen
Michael Davidson
Nathaniel Mackey
Maria Damon
Bob Perelman
Charles Bernstein
Charles Altieri
Tyrus Miller
Harryette Mullen
Robert Kaufman
Albert Gelpi
Rachel Blau Deplessis

Yes, many of them are not-uncoincidentally poets, yet also trained-as,
active-as, interesting-as scholars (no small feat).

I don't pretend in any way shape or form to be at all comprehensive, but the
fact that I could think of several interesting critics in only a few minutes
is heartening, at least to me.

Subject:      Re: What becomes a small press? PNY queries
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

re: the possible demise of PNY there are extenuating circumstances, probably
those Burt K. sd he'd rather not go into detail about.  Joint editorship
always involves personal wrangles; the PNY tale is maybe more of the same.
Tod Thilleman, listed on the intro pg of the latest edition of PNY as
Editor, in a post to me a while back

mentioned in passing that he'd just completed the next issue, wch wld be his
last.  About a week later came a mysterious post from Tod saying that he was
no longer involved w/ PNY, and all inquiries shld be directed to Burt
Kimmelman.  At my request for further detail, Thilleman responded that Burt
had locked him out of the PNY account, and had slandered him to his face,
saying that Tod hadn't answered his email of several days previous, that Tod
was drinking and smoking too much, was unstable, what with his being "out of
work" for the past three years, had gone off the deep end, and that he
(Kimmelman) feared the worst, ie., Tod sleeping in the gutter on the bowery,
surrounded by the $500 in the PNY account.  Tod sd

he responded to this w/ "a tactful letter" saying he was all done.  Since to
my knowledge, Tod did a considerable portion of the leg work in getting PNY
out, his sudden absence may be an additional "reason" for Kimmelman to
consider "letting the magazine die."

While (lack of) money and time are always essential issues to consider with
respect to publishing ventures, personal conflicts, and the ways issues
concerning available money and time intensify these, are pretty important
considerations in the poetry publishing scene, and, I think, should be
onjectified in the same manner - as issues for discourse, not just among
those most intimately involved, but for all those whose interests might lead
them down similar (troubling) paths.

I'm not saying that Kimmelman's response to David Kirschenbaum's questions
were dishonest - he DID say changes at PNY were unrelated to "a changing
market" - he just didn't take it far enough into the essential personal
issues wch, for the good of all those involved in like ventures, could've
been addressed more clearly, and in greater detail, since they seem to have
been the real "cause" of the current breakdown and/or break out of PNY.

Bob, you know, I don't mean to make you a straw man here, since we don't
know each other personally, and a short email is never representative of
anyone's views. Yet --- you know, to this "where is the good poetry
criticism" sort of thing, I often just want to say, open your eyes! I
agree that there's still far too little committed poetry criticism being
done, and I also feel it's deplorable that writing the poems is preferred
to writing poetry criticism (or better yet, doing both); but you know,
there's only as much out there as one cares to see. I feel compelled to
credentialize before I say what I'm going to say next, so, for the record:
I read and admire the poetry/poetics criticism in any number of small
coterie efforts, including the focused forums like Tripwire, Shark, How2,
PPNewsletter, etc. --- BUT: things are changing in the mid-circulation
mainstream, too. I've seen Jordan Davis review effectively in the
otherwise scattered Boston Book Review; at least half, and often more, of
the Publisher's Weekly poetry section is now written by (and often about)
Listees; and Boston Review is covering more engage poets with engage
reviews - my claim, because I have a small hand in it. 99% of the poetry
books reviewed in these publications is by live contemporary poets.
Granted, it's often mixed with deadening reviews of deadening work, or the
reviews are too short to really get anywhere; but, you know, as much as I
admire the coterie efforts, they have little impact on what someone who's
only ever read Lowell and Plath thinks 'good poetry' is. There are really
talented new poet-critics out there --- I think of Katy Lederer, Jen
Hofer, and Summi Kaipa b/c I know them, and Brian Kim Stefans b/c I see
his name everywhere --- but how many more there must be --- who I wish
would move into more of the mainstream publications, where their writing
might change people's minds. Yes, there's the risk of watching them
commoditize your dissent; but criticism that preaches to the converted is
going nowhere.

To me, 'otherstream' labor like your Comprepoetica, Bob, is an
indispensable part of the social process by which good poetry criticism
develops. But, as you say in one of your commentaries on the site,
mainstream cognizance of that criticism is another goal. For that, I think
one need assume more of a *civic* than a communitarian role, in the sense
that 'civic' implies a community that often disagrees with and sometimes
outright ignores you.

So far three alternatives (in not way mutually exclusive) have appeared:

        focus on the physical body (e.g., Whitman's genitalalia)

        creation of the persona body (e.g., Sondheim's avatars)

        the process by which language arises & perhaps its true so-to-speak
subject (e.g., Kristeva, Olson)

Then there is the kabbalistic or perhaps quasi-kabbalistic notion of
language as intrinsically embodied, we are only the vehicle.

Of course I am oversimplifying everything & would appreciate expansions &
other notions.

Dodie (and Tracey),

This male fear of the female body is quite real. And I have no doubt that
it may in some cases be exacerbated by what we're calling 'women's
increasing power.' I hope, though, that this increasing power will also
make it more difficult (even just cognitively) to restrict the
representation of 'woman' to anything in particular.

Men (speaking generally) may inherit a socialized power that compensates
powerfully for failing to meet the ideal of male physical beauty. Women
(speaking generally) still do not inherit this power.

The fear of someone else's, or of one's own body --- always (to wax
uncharacteristically Whitmanesque) fear of a good thing, no? Or is it
fear, I wonder, of the protector role itself, which everyone, M and F,
assumes and relinquishes at different times. I wonder, e.g., if that
particularly fraught and icky father-daughter 'protectiveness' isn't part
socialized property consciousness (this bad), but also partly a fear of
the horrible truth that you can only protect someone else's finite body
with the finitude of your own.

In the adolescent boys' locker room, a heightened sense of one's own
vulnerability as 'meat': torturable, the body as a liability. Fear of the
body --- it's fear of what might happen if you let go, care and be cared
for, fall into a lulling sleep. Not the cliche that it seems. You see it
on the subway every day. Meat-Boy's mother expresses shock and surprise at
his torment, because she loves him; her shock makes Meat-Boy feel even
more compromised, and so he decides that his mother has no idea what it's
like 'out there,' how Hobbesian it really is --- which maybe (to wax
uncharacteristically psychoanalytic) is one reason why up-middle-class
women and men feel that they can't comprehend each other, and others maybe
have other problems.

Steve,

As some on this list know, I don't consider them all that different.
Sure they have antithetical tastes, except for Ashbery and Ginsberg and a
couple of others.  But

they both are basically close readers;
they both defend poetry's continued and specifically AESTHETIC vitality;
they both think poetry's better than most other forms of cultural
production and "believe" in it, high-art style;
they both in their different ways offer "circles of belief" about poetry
(to misuse Bourdieu for a moment);
and they both are more or less hostile and/or resistant to political,
social, and other non-aesthetic approaches to poetry.

I said once, some years ago on this list, that Helen Vendler was Marjorie
Perloff's evil twin.  (Marjorie misread that as saying that _she_ was the
evil one -- not so).  A joke, but not far off then, or I think now.

They have been in rooms together several times.  The most relevant time
was the 1984(?) Alabama conference, "What is a Poet?," which Hank Lazer
edited for a book.  Also I think early in their careers they were both
fellows of the English Institute at Harvard at the same time, along with
Barbara Herrnstein Smith, who I think is more antithetical to both of
them than they are to each other.  Now _that_ would have been a room!

Announcing two new publications from Burning Deck Press:


A Test of Solitude: Sonnets
Emmanuel Hocquard
translated from the French by Rosmarie Waldrop
ISBN 1-886224-33-1
Serie d'ecriture
72 pages
$10.00

"Emulating Wittgenstein, who repaired to an isolated cabin in Norway
to write and reflect, Hocquard takes up his own test of solitude on a
farm not far from Bordeaux. What he writes there are unconventional
sonnets that arrive at their stipulated line-count by an ingenious
variety of means. They record with deceptive simplicity daily actions
and experiences. At the same time, an inquiry is being conducted, a
test of solitude that is also a test of poetry."

--Steve Evans, Notes to Poetry



ceteris paribus
Gale Nelson
ISBN 1-886224-37-4
128 pp
$12.00

Ceteris paribus is a phrase commonly used by economists and means
"assuming all other things are held constant." With this phrase, a
host of unintended results can be explained away as having been caused
by changes int he real world, and the model itself is sustained. As
the economy collapses around their ears, the bewildered theorists of
the dismal science may claim that were certris paribus only possible,
the predicted outcome would have obediently presented itself.
In Gale Nelson's poetry, language misbehaves much like the economy.
The multiplicity of factors at play on the page--and among
pages--keeps the poem from settling anywhere near constancy. Each time
order seems just around the corner, variances begin to seep in--and
anything becomes possible.



Both titles are available from Small Press Distribution, & are
featured titles for this month, receiving a 20% discount.

Comments: cc: joris@csc.albany.edu

Pierre,
Thanks for posting this.  It's interesting that, although Assad provides a
very general context (the usual Palestinian/Israeli tensions) for this
story, he neglects to mention issues surrounding Darwish's request to
Israeli authorities in (I believe it was) 1997 for a visa to travel from
Ramallah (a Palestinian autonomous area) to Acco, a town in Israel proper,
to attend the funeral of a colleage. (Palestinians living anywhere in the
West Bank [or in Jordan] are restriced in terms of traveling in or through
Israel.)  The request was denied, but later a "secret deal" was arranged
that allowed Darwish to visit Acco for something like 48 hours.  Given that
the "secret deal" - like all "screts" in that area of the world - was not so
secret, there was at the time an outcry from both sides about "double
standards."  A Netanyahu government spokesman claimed that the deal was a
"human gesture", tho permission for Darwish's visit was doubtless also to
placate hard(er)-line Palestinians unhappy with the Netanyahu regime's
recalcitrance viz the Oslo accords.  Many hard-line Palestinians recognized
this, and, tho holding back from public criticism of Darwish, sd privately
that they thought he should not have gone.  Weird that in both cases,
Darwish "represents" an ideology whose over-simplicity is only tangentially
related to his poetic work, wch goes mostly unread by either side.  While
the Israelis view him as a PLO terrorist and enemy of the state, the more
radical factions of Hamas and the Islamic Brotherhood view him as an
apologist for Israel and an enemy of God, while Arafat (and many ex-PLO
members of the autonomous area's governing body) views him as a traitor to
be kept at home with a cozy reputation, watched constantly by the police.  A
state poet on all counts - elevated to that position by the joint mistrust
of a non-reading public, loved by each and all, tho only to ends of their
own.
Would that we all were so lucky.

Jerrold,
     I am working on developing a print/web journal/press called Repo
Repro.  It will focus focus on similarities/differences in web and print
publications (Repro) and use of the body (experiential/projective) in
poetry.  The first work (mine, naturally!) is up at
http://sites.netscape.net/trbell/RepoRepro/listenan.htm and print
versions are available from me (2518 Wellington Pl., Murfreesboro, TN
37128) for $2.50ppd.  At this point in time I'm not writing to be
included on your duratiion page but more for advice, suggestions, etc.
For example, I'm not sure how to explain this clearly and simply.

I saw Miriam Patchen read from Kenneth Patchen's work in San Francisco,
maybe 1986? Mid eighties, I guess. Very moving.

There are (at least) a couple things about Miriam Patchen on the web: one,
an article written by Diane Sussman for the May 3rd, 1995 issue of the Palo
Alto Weekly; another, a synopsis of a film made about Miriam Patchen made by
Kim Roberts, but didn't list the date. They're both below:


People: Miriam Patchen: peace and love

"I can't do anything. I just feed squirrels and I give cookies to children."
Despite what she says, cookies and squirrels are hardly the sum of Miriam
Patchen's life. Patchen has contended with poverty, multiple sclerosis,
clashes with the government and two great loves--including one that thrust
her into the heady world of beat poets and the New York art avant-garde.

Even so, Patchen feels more like one who was borne along by circumstance
than one who set her own destiny. "Maybe if I hadn't married, I would have
become important and straightened out the world. I always wanted to
straighten out the world.

"I'm not smart," she continued. "I've just been with two remarkable men."

She certainly seems smart--and cantankerous, unsentimental and unconcerned
about public opinion. From her black house to her straggly long gray hair,
she suggests a woman used to, and fond of, her freedom. "I should be wearing
my hair braided," she said. "That's the only appropriate way for an old
woman to wear long hair."

But, she added, "I find it awfully hard to be a totally appropriate old
woman."

For 37 years, Patchen, now 80, was married to poet-painter Kenneth Patchen.
The celebrated artist, whose work is now on display at the Palo Alto
Cultural Center, died in the couple's Palo Alto cottage in 1972.

The rumpled cottage is a testimony to their time together. Patchen's
paintings hang at crooked angles on the orange walls while photographs of
him, a few with broken glass, dot the tables. It's as if the mementos are
too sacred to be touched, moved or cleaned. "I think he is always going to
be with me and around me. I knew that was why I was supposed to be with him.
I knew
he needed me to carry his work into the world."

Patchen has her own niche now: peace work and her love of recent decades, a
man she calls only by his first name, Laurent. Every Tuesday, Patchen,
Laurent and a small band of people spend two hours outside Town & Country
Village holding signs that read, "Honk for peace." It's an activity she has
been doing for 20 years.

Miriam and Kenneth Patchen met when they were university students in
Massachusetts. They were an unlikely couple. He was artistic, a pacifist, a
leftist. She was pragmatic, insecure and wanted her independence. Still, she
was drawn to him. "I knew the first time I met him, he was a master poet. I
knew I had to help him."

His parents opposed the match. "I was Catholic and a foreigner, which is to
say, from Massachusetts."

The two married in 1934. They started out poor and stayed poor. "Even the
Guggenheim (award) he gave away," she said. For a while, they got by on
relief. Later, when Patchen was bedridden with back pain, Miriam worked at
the jewelry counter in San Francisco's posh City of Paris department store.
"Here was I, in this dress I made from a 74-cent bolt of cloth, in this
glamorous, glamorous spot."

The Patchens moved to Palo Alto in 1958 for medical care--she for treatment
of multiple sclerosis, he for treatment of his back. They bought a house
with a $2,000 down payment from Miriam's mother, but only after being
assured payments would be no more than $50 per month.

Although she always hoped for a more rural house, or at least a house made
of wood, her "cement block" contains too many memories to leave. "I still
feel him," she said. "I just belong to him."

"Miriam Is Not Amused"
A Film By Kim Roberts • 23 min. • 16 mm

Witty, wry and lyrical, Miriam Is Not Amused is a multilayered portrait of
Miriam Patchen- activist, widow, and muse of famed poet Kenneth Patchen. The
film combines rare archival footage with intimate observations of Miriam
now. From her non-traditional upbringing in the 20’s and 30’s, through the
years spent in the shadow of her celebrated husband, to her current

Brian,

I've been reviewing for the San Francisco Chronicle, so your post
spoke to much I've been thinking about.  I do not think that writing
for the SF Chronicle has brought me much respect from my peers--one
instead gets the sense that one is "stooping."  But, this doesn't
bother me much--it has little to do with why I'm doing it.

My experience with the Chronicle has been one of paying my dues,
doing books they wanted reviewed--not all of them, I always
negotiated--to moving into a relationship where they're open to books
I might propose to review.  That isn't as marvelous as it would
sound.  First of all, there is the issue of their not wanting people
to review books of their friends (journalistic ethics).  As you well
know, for most writers many of the books that they admire will have
been written by their friends.  So, that's one area of difficulty.

Another difficulty is how difficult it is to write about difficult
work (see that:  3 difficulties and I haven't even gotten to the
point) in a form that will work for a mainstream audience.  I
recently reviewed Dennis Cooper's new book *Period* (my suggestion,
will be published March 19).  I've been a long-time admirer of
Cooper's work, so I asked to do this before I had read the book.  The
book turned out to be formally difficult and theoretical--and I could
not use my "usual" bag of tricks to deal with it since none of them
would be appropriate for a newspaper review.  It ended up being an
enormous amount of work understanding the book to the point that I
felt comfortable writing about it, and then translating it to this
foreign form.  (And, yes, I did love the book, and I recommend it to
you all.)  I must say that the Chronicle was very supportive of my
final version, which still pushing the envelope.

One other thing, writing in a manner that avoids the first person was
wrenching for me, but the more I do it (I am allowed an occasional
well placed "I" from time to time, but not much) the more I enjoy it.
It feels more distilled, a letting go of the ego, though I don't
think it really is.

I haven't yet braved reviewing any poetry for them.

Dodie

it was suggested bc that I post the following fc:

left-brained verbal, but i've been drawing with my left hand

(somewhat as if i were mentally rehearsing throing a

     i'm not sure how clear this is?  i posted to poetics

Good.  This is news to me.  The announcements and ads of these two
publications didn't strike me favorably--perhaps because they aren't
reviewing MY favorite contemporary poets.  But if either or both really
are reviewing poetry at the level that most of the people involved with
this poetry list read, write and review, great.  Finding out that kind
of thing was really the main aim of my post.  (Well, next to spouting
off.)

My complaint is, or was supposed to be, exactly this: that all the good
criticism is being written in the nowhere-stream.  Publisher's Weekly
and the Boston Review are out in the open, though--but is anyone writing
criticism for them like Frank Kermode's for the London Review?  He's
excellent, I think, but has no more interest in contemporary poetry than
Harold Bloom.

Thanks for the response, Brian.  Makes sense to me.  As did Kathy Lou
Schultz's, to which I responded back-channel not knowing she had posted
her comments here as well as to me.  I didn't say anything back
to her worth putting here, though--as far as I know.

I'm curious, Brian, to know what you think about this same argument as it
might apply to publishing poetry in literary journals in general. As
evidenced or at least stated last night at the first night of Issue Zero,
the lit mag conference organized by Brendan Lorber here in New York City,
there is a parallel idea or belief that the smaller, less glossy, and more
"community"- or coterie-oriented the publication, the somehow healthier for
the state of the art in general. I felt funny hearing/watching this claim
being made, as editor of a journal (Fence) whose conception and continued
aim inheres with an involvement with mainstream everything. The argument
against Fence's validity as a credible organ for dissemination of poetry
being that it is "coopting" or diluting or superficializing experimental
poetries' political raisons d'etre for mainstream gloss patronage by
juxtaposing experimental poetries with what I sometimes call idiosyncratic
poetries, i.e., poetry that is excellent in some way and that is not easily
recognizable as having been raised in any particular camp.

My interest in poems is not in their community-based rightness but in my
apprehension of them on a page. 'Spose that's largely a removal from social
context, but not if you believe that the page is part of that context, and
that the culture of readership is one of consumerism--at least in terms of
print magazines. Such that there is the hope of "changing people's minds"
on all sides of the . . . umm . . . wall.

Just wondering if you--or anyone out there--see any relationship between
these things.

Brian's point about poetry criticism being there if you look for it, in
both the small press and some mid-circulation publications, strikes me
as valid.  But the small press seems to me to lag a bit in this
department, and there seems to me to be less criticism of a
larger-than-review scale than there could be.

Think of all the poetry magazines out there, and how many of them don't
even carry reviews, let alone more ambitious essays about poetry,
poetics, and the scenes, events and institutions that give poetry its
contexts.

One of the reasons for starting Samizdat last year was to make a forum
for many different kinds of prose about poetry: reviews, editorials,
longer essays on the poets we print, and reports on poetry scenes around
the world.

There are some journals doing similar work (the Electronic Book Review,
for example, and John Tranter's always-amazing Jacket, to name the
online outlets), but I wish there were more.

The genre I'd really like to see more of is the essay that reviews a
bunch of poets at once, and puts them into some kind of context.
Michael Anania said that a "curious silence" surrounds American poetry,
and part of that silence comes from not putting the poets into
conversation with one another, as this kind of review can do.

Well, back to my jet-lagged coffee swilling, my two cents spent and my
phone ringing.

Bob

Looks like I'll be moving to Boston in August so if any kind, generous

appreciate it.  I know various Boston-related stuff has floated by on
this
list, even recently, but I wasn't paying close enuff attention since i
wasn't sure where i was going until just recently.  Sounds like Jamie
Crawford's website, when it's done, will be a good place to start
poetry-wise, but I'd love to hear from anyone about poetry, mags, books,

David Kellogg and Aldon Nielsen:

both read poetry closely
both participate in circles of disbelief
both attended EASTERN universities
both read _WHAT IS A POET?_ and still wondered what the answer to the
question was
have appeared in the same questionable journal not only with one another
BUT WITH MARJORIE PERLOFF
both buy drinks with their own money at the Marxist Cash Bar of the MLA
both think Helen Vendler is a symptom of something
both thought "Yasusada" was something drunken southerners called you as         an
insult

AND the only time anyone has ever seen them together, they were in the same
room!

coincidence? perhaps . . .

DAVE BARATIER is a poetry dynamo. He has so many projects going, you'd think
he was a cottage industry. Most recently, his chapbook THE FALL OF BECAUSE was
published by Pudding House Press. He resides in Columbus, OH, where he hosts a
reading series and where his PAVEMENT SAW Press and journal is based. He has a
new prose novel coming out on Spuyten Divil Press. His incisive interview with
poet Simon Perchik is published in the on-line journal JACKET.

MARALYN LOIS POLAK is the self-proclaimed 'Bitch Goddess of the Philadelphia
Poetry Scene.' We don't yet know what this means. What we do know is that she
is very active as a poet, writer and performer in Philadelphia. She has
performed one-woman shows in two previous Fringe festivals and is the author
of The Writer As Celebrity: Intimate Interviews, Facing the Music, El Otro
Lado, Horse Slaves, and The Bologna Sandwich and Other Poems of LOVE and
Indigestion.

****************************************************************

THE POETRY CAPITANOS

Live up the black, crashing
parties in their chartreuse
sweatshirts, with the biggest
bats of meaning, megaphones of
mystery. Abruptly, gossiping
about theory dissipates
and Joe gets smacked upside the head
for those who are tackling a darkness
are reprimanding utterances severed
from context. The scholars, in strict
literary fashion, dampen our discourse
on flora and weather beaten properties
until we seek refuge in the kitchen
talking about dishwashing
jobs and how cooking preserves.

2. SWEPT AWAY

Then I developed my theory
of feminist porn:
to a strong woman, NOTHING could be more titillating--
more pornographic--
than being subjugated
by an even stronger man.
That was why Lina Wertmuller's film "Swept Away"
swept ME away
in a moist pool of experience,
gave me chils up and down my spine.
"Senior Carunchio", the rich woman panted,
shipwrecked on a desert island
with her social inferior.
This was a premise straight out of Shaw,
who recognized that the so-called primitive underclass
was better eqipped to survive
in the middle of nowhere,
implying they were probably hornier,
and sexier.
Addled by lust, the woman
sadly learns that her topsy-turvy love
would never work In Real Life.

Dear Stephen Ellis,

Enquiring minds want to know, eh? Sorry not to be as forthcoming as you
would desire. Now, is your stake in all this brouhaha about PNY your concern
for literary history? Or, perhaps you are simply trying to help out an
apparently maligned friend.

I'm sorry, but your whole line of inquiry (or is it meant as innuendo) --
which calls for some sort of full disclosure on my part, supposedly
justified by the caution it would provide to other editors of po mags --
seems to me to be motivated, when you get right down to it, by nothing more
or less than an unsated prurience.

And frankly, this thread of discussion about PNY's troubles, even as it
involves me, strikes me as now turning toward the utterly banal at best.
Perhaps if at some point in time Mr. Thilleman's biographer -- or yours,
even! -- should need some further clarification as to the how and why of
what was the Thilleman-Kimmelman relationship in its entire trajectory from
first blush to last snarl, then I'll find within my hard scheming heart that
small measure of candor to oblige with some juicy tidbits that would,
really, amount to nothing.

Subject: Re: What becomes a small press? PNY queries

re: the possible demise of PNY there are extenuating circumstances,
probably
those Burt K. sd he'd rather not go into detail about.  Joint editorship
always involves personal wrangles; the PNY tale is maybe more of the
same.
Tod Thilleman, listed on the intro pg of the latest edition of PNY as
Editor, in a post to me a while back

mentioned in passing that he'd just completed the next issue, wch wld be
his
last.  About a week later came a mysterious post from Tod saying that he
was
no longer involved w/ PNY, and all inquiries shld be directed to Burt
Kimmelman.  At my request for further detail, Thilleman responded that
Burt
had locked him out of the PNY account, and had slandered him to his
face,
saying that Tod hadn't answered his email of several days previous, that
Tod
was drinking and smoking too much, was unstable, what with his being
"out of
work" for the past three years, had gone off the deep end, and that he
(Kimmelman) feared the worst, ie., Tod sleeping in the gutter on the
bowery,
surrounded by the $500 in the PNY account.  Tod sd

he responded to this w/ "a tactful letter" saying he was all done.
Since to
my knowledge, Tod did a considerable portion of the leg work in getting
PNY
out, his sudden absence may be an additional "reason" for Kimmelman to
consider "letting the magazine die."

While (lack of) money and time are always essential issues to consider
with
respect to publishing ventures, personal conflicts, and the ways issues
concerning available money and time intensify these, are pretty
important
considerations in the poetry publishing scene, and, I think, should be
onjectified in the same manner - as issues for discourse, not just among
those most intimately involved, but for all those whose interests might
lead
them down similar (troubling) paths.

I'm not saying that Kimmelman's response to David Kirschenbaum's
questions
were dishonest - he DID say changes at PNY were unrelated to "a changing
market" - he just didn't take it far enough into the essential personal
issues wch, for the good of all those involved in like ventures,
could've
been addressed more clearly, and in greater detail, since they seem to
have
been the real "cause" of the current breakdown and/or break out of PNY.

I'd like to print something about this stellar shunt-collision in Jacket

death is absolutely neutral & one is fated to die & death can come at any
time & death is completely random & death is the absolute end & there is
nothing beyond death & there is no good way to die & all deaths are equi-
valent & all deaths end the same & death kills ghosts & death has no
excuses & death has no morals & death has no ethics & death is existence &
one cannot prepare for death & all life occurs in life & death is always
invisible & life is a withdrawal & death has no movement & death kills
worlds & death has no place in the universe & death is universal & death
devours death & death is neither subject nor object & death is always
tired & death leaves a trail & death leaves a trace & death is traceless &
there is no history after death & death is final & death has no stories &
death is always absent & there is no death & there is no passage & death
is not brutal & death is inconceivable & death has no attributes &

Oh, this is sad news. I remember meeting her three summers ago at Naropa. It
was just after Ronald Johnson had read and many of us had gathered at a
restaurant for drinks. I forget now how old she was but she was _quite_ old
I believe, and completely lively and beautiful. Aldon Nielsen will recall
this, I think, because he was sitting right there, too, but in any event at
one point in the long evening she leaned forward toward us and declared
brightly, as if unmasking a conspiracy, "I am not the woman in those poems!"

David K writes:

"they both are basically close readers;
they both defend poetry's continued and specifically AESTHETIC vitality;
they both think poetry's better than most other forms of cultural
production and "believe" in it, high-art style;
they both in their different ways offer "circles of belief" about poetry
(to misuse Bourdieu for a moment);
and they both are more or less hostile and/or resistant to political,
social, and other non-aesthetic approaches to poetry."

I respectfully disagree:

1. Perloff and Vendler are close readers in antithetical ways. Perloff is
a formalist and Vendler is a New Critic. Also, there is no other way of
reading poetry. "Distant reading" just doesn't cut it.

2. The choice of authors read is not inconsequential, it goes beyond
"taste." Does it really make no difference if the text studied is by John
Cage or James Merrill? Is the aestheticism of these two prominent critics
the same, then? What does a "non-aesthetic" approach to poetry look like,
anyway? Does any concern with the social or political drive out the
aesthetic by definition? (or vice-versa?) This statement also ignores the
extent to which Perloff does in fact contextualize poetry in its social
and historical milieu.

3. Is it really true that Perloff believes poetry to be "better" than
music, art, cinema, drama, the novel? I've never seen her make a statement
to that effect. As far as "believing" in poetry, sure. It would be pretty
absurd for someone to devote an entire lifetime to something without some
sort of conviction as to its importance. The same goes for Vendler. But I
don't think their "style" of belief is identical either.

4. So Vendler and Perloff are not really "all that different"--they are
both influential critics who write a lot of books out of strong belief
systems about poetry and oppose certain forms of socio-political
criticism, though not necessarily for the same reasons.

Writing Class: The Kootenay School of Writing Anthology
edited by Andrew Klobucar and Michael Barnholden
New Star Books
$16, paper
ISBN: 0--921586--68--X

The KSW was, and continues to be, a grassroots organization in all senses of
the word; shunning any sort of professionalism and codification of
attitudes, and opting instead for an "anarcho-syndicalist" model of
community, this group of experimental -- and highly political -- poets has
formed something of the the underskin to Vancouver aeshetic radicalism since
the mid-1980s.  As the informative introduction by the editors states, the
school surfaced as a response to the closing by British Columbia's
right-wing Social Credit government of the David Thompson University Centre
in Nelson, a small city that had, since the 19th-century (when the
Doukhobors, a Russian radical spiritualist sect, settled there) a reputation
for progressive, even utopian, attitudes.  Started by writers such as Gary
Whitehead, Calvin Wharton and Jeff Derksen (who has since become an
important Canadian critic as well as poet), the school forged early, however
troubled, ties with radical labor movements in Vancouver, most notably with
the Wobblies.  The writers themselves found inspiration in the New American
poetics of the sixties (channeled through the Tish school of Canadian
poets), but later made a turn toward "Language writing" techniques, though
always maintaining a distinctive refusal to assimilate into any sort of
literary or academic culture.  Indeed, the "class" of this book's title
leans more toward this forging of identity against the mainstream -- as a
self-conscious "class" of writers -- than anything to do with "workshops"
and preparations to fame.  Such fruitful, long-term community radicalism is
rare; indeed, testament to the anti-authoritarian nature of the group is the
sub-group, "The Giantesses," formed by women writers -- such as Lisa
Robertson and Catriana Strang -- who were troubled by the KSW's male
hegemony.  This anthology doesn't include theoretical or descriptive
statements by the poets, which is unfortunate, though little theory, in
fact, was produced; the members felt that published "discourse," even
manifestos, played into the norms of class rule.  The poetry, however, by
relative unknowns such as Gerald Greene (a intricate, long poem called
"Resume" [i.e. the document with your work history on it, not the verb]),
Peter Culley (elegant social-pastorals such as "Winterreise"), Kevin Davies
(the bracket-within-brackets section of his book Pause Button), Kathryn
Mcleod (technically hardcore and dazzling work, like "The Infatuation"), Dan
Farrell's entire "Thimking of You" (long out of print) and Dorothy Trujillo
Lusk's sand-blasting "Oral Tragedy," along with excellent work by Robertson
and Derksen, are bound to pique interest in this distinctly West Coast
phenomenon.  The question, of course, is if the language of an activist,
radical, at times abrasive, group is taken out of the contingencies of its
immediate situation, can the poems achieve the effects intended, that of
rearticulating and rendering visible the toxicities of class relations, or
will they retreat into the history of literature, as the secret hobbies of a
learned social strata?  Writing Class doesn't answer this question, but
nonetheless it is a call-to-arms in the wilds of contemporary times in which
commerce has superceded community as our main "moral" interest, both on this
continent and abroad.  This book, more than any anthology of "avant-garde"
American poetry produced in the States recently, fulfills the promise of
Donald Allen's seminal New American Poetry, bringing as it does a truly
secret, unacknowledged and often masterful group of subversive works into
the light.

what purpose does photography have?  I am thinking about
Orvell's study, _The Real Thing_, in which he makes note of
the Victorian fascination not only with exactness/replication
but distortion/alteration in the new medium of photography.

similar poles seem to run through most commentaries on
translation:  (1) the value of an exactness already impossible
in the act of translation (who said that literature is by definition
untranslatable?  apologies if that was posted already)--i.e.
the value of the attempt to "reproduce" the original; (2) the
value of the translator's separate production in a different place
and time.

I have just been looking in Xcp4 at "The Guest of Literature:
The Issue of Hospitality in Literary Translation," by Piotr Gwiazda.
It opens with Blanchot's remark, "We do not see why the act of
the translator should not be appreciated as the quintessential
literary act, one which proposes that the reader remain ignorant
of the text it reveals to him and from which his ignorance will
not distance him.  Instead, it will bring him closer by becoming
active, by representing to him the great interval that separates
him from it."  Gwiazda notes "the deep difficulty of accepting
translation as a distinct type of literature," then comments,
"Blanchot's words propose a displacement of translation from the
shadow of literature, or rather the shadow *between* literatures,
where it looms as both familiar and alien, close and remote, welcome
and unwelcome; where it sojourns as a guest.  Translation implies
an almost political process of balancing and negotiation; a transfer;
a difference."  Gwiazda frames the rest of the essay around the
way that readers approach translation suspiciously--with "the
vigilance which is not unlike the typical treatment of a stranger,
a foreigner, and most of all--a guest."

--an interesting piece & worth looking up, anyway

Well, I'll pipe in since the name has been mentioned (and I am beginning to
lose track which Brian is meant -- nice to know the age of Brians has
survived glam).  I do hope to write for more "mainstream" journals on the
things I'm interested in, but don't really have the time, frankly, to do the
job very well, and my only goal in writing for these journals/magazines
would be to present some not-yet-uttered perspective on things, new and old,
and some degree of depth but, as well, in a language that is both appealing
and detailed, transformative, and not highbrow and oriented toward merely
revising extant opinions on things for the sake of it -- which is to say in
a way literary criticism is generally not written, I feel. I don't have that
language myself, but think it could be done and is worth the effort.  I'm
not polemical by nature, believe it or not (I think I am read as a
polemecist, but that's because, in some ways, some of the things I write tap
into other people's deep-seated ideological notions, notions which they
don't choose, or are unable, to recognize); I'm more of a diplomat, I think,
but like to stir things up anyway, for fun, and get people talking if
possible.  I don't, however, think that the little magazines, or the poetics
list, are lesser forums for poetry criticism -- quite the opposite, I feel
if I were to write some fabulous essay for some glossy journal that cost $10
and which might not be of any other interest to me except for a poem here or
there, and most of which is bosh, I would end up having to xerox my fabulous
essay just to get it read, because I would never ask them to buy it;
consequently, I would be signalling my approval of the editorship of said
magazine, or maybe the contents, and hence in a way the status quo, which is
not something I'd like to do.  So the pressure, then, would be to write
something very controversial for said glossy journal, with the hopes that it
would cause a stir and people would go out and buy their only issue of, say,
Parnassus: Poetry in Review, just to see what said tyro (in this case, me,
but it could be anyone) wrote.  To write a rather tame, coherent and nice
thing for that journal would be to condemn oneself (in my mind) to more
obscurity than to write something interesting on the list, which as far as I
can tell is being read by a lot of interesting people -- 867 of whom are
Americans!

What should really happen, I feel, is that papers like the Village Voice
should give a few more pages to really good writing about poetry, and should
try to integrate it into their image (or non-image, which is better) of New
York and world culture; similar journals in other cities should do the same.
But then again, as poets, the only thing we can really think about is how to
write poems that have anything at all to do with "today," and in a fashion
that is both interesting and upsetting (i.e. can drive them nutty so that
they want to know more) to a lot of people, rather than soothing and boring
(making them think that, if they don't hurry to get in line for Scream 4,
they may have to wait an extra week to see it), which is tough.  So the
criticism question always ends there, as far as I'm concerned.

I actually had this idea, recently, anticipating this panel with
Perloff/Vendler et al, that literary criticism was really only a matter of
creating myths, whether they be of persons, or of reading styles, or even of
meaning, since poetry itself is really just data that, without criticism,
would really just be scattered over the terrain with no linkages between
them, and which can be approached individually without an apparatus at all,
picked up, discarded, etc.  I don't think poems take on their talismanic
flavour without something of what criticism provides -- either as history or
theoretical framework -- though a "time before criticism" is hard to
imagine.  The "myths" of criticism provide the social glue that lumps poems
and poets together, or poems and poems together, or whatever, and is
necessary in that way in order to continue public interest when private
interest is waning (I even read criticism sometimes, when I'm a little bored
with poetry).  Of course, "folk" poetries -- like oral poetries or other
types of quasi-non-literal poetry, like that of OE, would not fit into this,
but they also don't possess that talismanic flavour that we generally feel
poems are supposed to have to be "poems."  This would be a severe reduction
in the idea of the critic's "task," they would be merely story tellers with
no claims to greater truths (certainly not in the area of refining aesthetic
sensibility, which is what they often think they are doing) -- fine, that's
good, hope someone's bothered by it.  I also think most of my poems are
literary crticism, of sorts.

As a last note, I have written longer essays, but they've always appeared in
little journals or specialist journals, like Korean Culture.  The only
people concerned were those I mentioned in the essay.

Last last note, I'm only interested in criticism insofar as it concerns
ideas for writing poetry.

Cheers,
Brian

Steve,

First the important stuff: you can spot the office of the Car Talk guys, if
not
the guys themselves, in Harvard Square looking away from Harvard Yard toward
the third floor of the rounded building above the Curious George that
ornaments
the Wordsworth bookstore. (Don't bother with the bookstore but read all the
H.A. Rey you can get your hands on!) The Car Talk office window is labeled
"Dewey, Cheatham, and Howe" and I think on Friday nights they play poker
there,
often with master bookbinder Bob Marshall, whose shop is just down the hall
and
is an enjoyable and lively place to drop by on a Saturday morning. Below their
office is the office of a real estate agent who is president of the cartel of
real estate agents in Massachusetts and whom I personally heard testify in the
State House to the effect that "no one wants to live near public housing
because it brings property values down." His appearance was intended to help
defeat a bill that would have provided money for public housing taken from
sales of very expensive housing in Cambridge. The bill died in committee. To
the credit of the legislators on the panel, they slammed the president/agent
for his comments. Above the DC&H office, on the top floor, is an antiquarian
bookshop run by the former publisher of the Pym-Randall Press, who is also a
Ford Maddox Ford scholar. Very pricey. On Saturdays in the fall, if you know
the bookbinder, you can get out onto the roof of the building as the Harvard
band goes by. It's not much of a thrill but it's there.

Well, that's one building, and I hope I've been helpful.

I'll try to write more later.

In a message dated 3/13/2000 1:55:39 PM Eastern Standard Time,
jmayhew@EAGLE.CC.UKANS.EDU writes:

<< David K writes:

 "they both are basically close readers;
 they both defend poetry's continued and specifically AESTHETIC vitality;
 they both think poetry's better than most other forms of cultural
 production and "believe" in it, high-art style;
 they both in their different ways offer "circles of belief" about poetry
 (to misuse Bourdieu for a moment);
 and they both are more or less hostile and/or resistant to political,
 social, and other non-aesthetic approaches to poetry."

 I respectfully disagree:

 1. Perloff and Vendler are close readers in antithetical ways. Perloff is
 a formalist and Vendler is a New Critic. Also, there is no other way of
 reading poetry. "Distant reading" just doesn't cut it.

 2. The choice of authors read is not inconsequential, it goes beyond
 "taste." Does it really make no difference if the text studied is by John
 Cage or James Merrill? Is the aestheticism of these two prominent critics
 the same, then? What does a "non-aesthetic" approach to poetry look like,
 anyway? Does any concern with the social or political drive out the
 aesthetic by definition? (or vice-versa?) This statement also ignores the
 extent to which Perloff does in fact contextualize poetry in its social
 and historical milieu.

 3. Is it really true that Perloff believes poetry to be "better" than
 music, art, cinema, drama, the novel? I've never seen her make a statement
 to that effect. As far as "believing" in poetry, sure. It would be pretty
 absurd for someone to devote an entire lifetime to something without some
 sort of conviction as to its importance. The same goes for Vendler. But I
 don't think their "style" of belief is identical either.

 4. So Vendler and Perloff are not really "all that different"--they are
 both influential critics who write a lot of books out of strong belief
 systems about poetry and oppose certain forms of socio-political
 criticism, though not necessarily for the same reasons. >>

Close reading is always a good thing, even if you're also bringing in
contextual criticism. Yet we all know how slippery a term "formalist" is.
Every "New Critic," or neo-New Critic, as the case may be with Vendler, is a
formalist, but not vice versa. Although I do know what Mayhew is saying when
he writes that Vendler is a "New Critic," whereas Perloff is a "Formalist," I
would like the benefit of the mind that came up with this discriminating
statement. Could you, Jonathan, elaborate, on Vendler qua "New Critic,"
versus Perloff qua "Formalist."

Dear Elizabeth,
Can I be your biggest fan? If I were, I would be called a groupie, because
we commonly come in groups.

Unlike lesbians, who come in bunches -- like bananas.

One day it occurred to me: I didn't have to marry a rock star, I could BE a
rock star. (Insert desired profession or quality here ____ ) For Hilary it
didn't work out so good; she still had to marry the president.

When I was a girl, I fucked a boy in the ass. And afterward, I was still a
girl.

When I wore lipstick people smiled at me more and were pleased.

Subject:      Dario Argento in San Jose
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

I found God a week ago Thursday, but then it slipped my mind, now
I've got it straight again but have forgotten some of the details.
But here in San Francisco some of us who love the films of the
Italian horror director Dario Argento were terribly excited when we
found out that he was to be the guest of honor at the 10th San Jose
Film Festival, and was slated to appear, in person, to introduce four
of his films on four consecutive days.  On March 2nd Pam Lu and I
drove down to San Jose, about an hour from downtown San Francisco,
and we stopped off at a cute bungalow nearby the theater.  There in
this cite bungalow live the poets David Larsen and Beth Murray, the
only people I know in San Jose (and the editors of the "San Jose
Manual of Style" which is a really cool theory journal).  They made a
lavish Italian dinner and we practiced speaking Italian and then we
went to the show (Beth stayed home out of a fore-dained pre-knowledge
that she wouldn't like "Suspiria").  The theater was not too crowded
and we slipped into our seats quietly, reverential hush.  Then I
spotted Dario Argento standing in the back of the darkened
auditorium, particles of popcorn scented lobby light illuminating the
curve of his shoulders and his weird, untamed and greasy hair, now
gray, but purple in the light.  I squealed because I had seen a god,
nudging my companions.  "It's him," I breathed.  Some San Jose
functiunary came on and gave a short civic boosting speech and then
brought on "Dario" (as the fans call him, familiarly) and we screamed
with pleasure.  He is a goofy clownish guy in person, just as odd as
the publicity pictures for the past 30 years have suggested, but very
sweet and Roberto Benigni, or else this is a strategy to get his
savage message past the hearts of the adoring multitudes who love
this kind of language play and "how do you say" kind of bumblingitis.
I think this the case.  If you haven't seen these pictures, imagine
an extremely tall, cadaverously spooky looking man with a head the
exact shape of a skull, eye burning out of deep-set sockets, --looks
like he's been dead for several days.  He is horribly creepy, like a
gravedigger or zombie, and looks totally cruel and debauched, like
the picture of Dorian Gray in the attic.  But as I say, in life he is
considerablu shorter, plumper and sweeter.

Dario gave a short little "thank you" talk and then the lights went
down and they showed "Suspiria" in a widescreen print I had never
seen before.  Pam and I noticed several details right away that you
couldn't see in the regular pan and scan TV print we had watched
often before, for example, when Jessica Harper first gets off the
plane and walks through the airplane terminal right there on her
right, striding towards the camera, is none other than Daria
Nicolodi, dressed in a fetching 70s style--we cheered, having a
perverse love for Daria (who is the former wife of Dario and the lead
in several of his mid-career pictures) (not the world's greatest
actress, and remarkably plain for a movie star, but an indelible
presence of Italian cinema) (and also the co-writer of "Suspiria").
What else, we asked ourselves, had we missed? -- and the answer
turned out to be plenty!!

I won't bore you all with our group analysis of the film.  Either you
like it or you hate it but try if you can to imagine our thrill when
after the movie ended a compact Monty Woolley type brought Dario back
on stage to ask him questions, and then opened up the questions to
the audience.  I will share the revelations back channel if pressed,
but let me think of the top 2 or 3 things he said.  "Suspiria," which
takes place largely in a scary ballet academy for teens and young
people, was originally written to feature children--really young
children, say, ten or so, but the producers thought it would be bad
taste to have so many children murdered.  But his vision triumphed in
that he asked all the actors to act as if they were children (which
explains why so many of the performances, which we had thought were
just sort of "European" and unfocussed, are so brilliant.  Also
that's why the doorknobs are up so high on all the doors, to further
this effect.  Check it out!  When asked why the animals in his
films-- such as the maggots and the seeing eye dog in "Suspiria"--are
so much better at acting than his actors, he retorted by claiming
that everyone's talking about the "final masterpiece of Kubrick" but
that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are nothing more than big Muppets.
Animals, he said, are better actors by nature (a Bressonian credo
too).  At this juncture David sneaked down to the front of the stage
and snapped a picture of him with my camera.

When the Q & A thing was over, he stayed to sign autographs and have
his picture taken with whoever wanted it.  We each stood on a little
line, no longer than your average line for taking Holy Communion in a
Catholic Church, and shook his hand, got our photos signed, clapped
him on the back and tried to thank him for coming 18 hours on
Alitalia all the way from the "Profondo Rosso" studio in Rome all the
way to San Jose.  Apparently he thought it *was* San Francisco, but I
set him straight.

So that's why I've been out of touch . . .



Kevin Killian

PS Other good films with Daria Nicolodi include "Deep Red,"
"Tenebrae," "Phenomena" and "Opera"-- you must see her, she's like
nothing else in the world and just about indescribable as an icon.

DAVID TOSCANA's novel Tula Station, new in translation this spring from St.
Martin's, has been compared (in Publishers Weekly) to the writings of Julio
Cort=E1zar, the young Carlos Fuentes, and Umberto Eco.  *  He is the author
as well of three other novels, and is recognized as one of the most
significant young Mexican writers.   *  A participant (in 1994) in the
International Writing Program at the University of Iowa, he lives in his
hometown of Monterrey, Nuevo Leon State, in northern Mexico.  *

M=F3NICA LAV=EDN lives in Mexico City, and is the author of several collecti=
ons
of short stories, including Cuentos de desencuentros y otros (Stories of
misencounters and others, 1986) and Ruby Tuesday no ha muerto (Ruby Tuesday
is not dead, 1998)--which won the Gilberto Owen National Literary Prize-as
well as two novels.  *  Ms. Lav=EDn will be in residence at the Banff Center
for the Arts during summer 2000, and she's the recipient of a grant from
the US-Mexico Fund for Culture to support the production and publication of
a new anthology of Mexican fiction writers born in the fifties, forthcoming
from City Lights Books of San Francisco.  *

Mr. Toscana and Ms. Lav=EDn will be introduced by poet JUVENAL ACOSTA.

Well, now that I've had a good laugh at Aldon's wonderful post, let me
throw my own evil words into this ring:

no one so far seems to have noticed how sexist this whole little game
is!  Why should anyone compare Helen and Me except that we're both
ladies of a certain age, and overweight to boot!  I noticed that the
third person David Kellogg brought into the conversation was Barbara H.
Smith--a third woman.  Why do I have more in common with HV than with,
say, Richard Howard?  John Hollander?  Cal Bedient?
Michael Scharf, whom I don't yet know, said in his article that Helen
and I are both "late career professionals."  I ask you all:  does anyone
call Harold Bloom a late-career professional?  Or Hillis Miller?
Scharf also said Helen and I have a similar career trajectory.  For the
record, let me clear that one up for anyone who cares, although why
should anyone?
Helen is Boston Irish Catholic, brought up very Catholic and rebelled
against it.  I am Jewish, Viennese, a refugee, with strong European ties
and hence much more interested in German and French and Italian poetry
(also Middle European) than is Helen.
Helen went to Harvard but in the early 60s Harvard was very sexist and
wouldn't hire her so she taught for years at Boston University.
I was a housewife-returnee to school who went to Catholic University in
Washington since that was the only place I could go.  I was one of the
only grad students who wasn't in a religious order but it was kind of
fun.  However, I had no Ivy league connections of any sort.  Unlike
Helen, though, I also didn't encounter the sexism she did at Harvard
because on the unfashionable circuit I was on, there wasn't much sexism.

And so on and so forth.  So much for similar career trajectories.  About
as similar as Donald Davie and me, right?  As for reading habits and
such, I'll have to leave that up to others.  For those interested in my
own view, I have a long review essay on Helen's criticism in
Contemporary Literature from c. 1985 or so.

Incidentally, I didn't know when I was asked to be in this program who
else would be in it.  So it's not exactly a set up, at least not on
Helen's and my part.

apocrypha of contemporary low-rent American. As such, they are, as the
author puts it: "decidedly secular exegesis in the spiritual station of
the Onion," blasphemous, hell-raising, full of astounding yearning and
haunted by unnameable conbobertaion.

The Resurrection of Lady Lester by OyamO

This play is, in part, a retelling of the life of Lester Young, the
great jazz saxophonist of the late 1930s and early 1940s. Earlyl in his
career Young left the Count Basie band to replace the reigning saxophone
leged of the day, Coleman Hawkins, in the Fletcher Henderson band. But
Lester, refusing to imitate Hawkins' bold and breathy style,
resigned the Henderson band, rejoining Basie in his Reno Club combo,
becoming one of the star soloists. Young often recorded with Billie
Holiday, whom he dubbed Lady Day, becoming a close professional and
personal friend of the singer. After his induction into the army in 1944
and imprisonment for, allegedly, drug jpossession (a photograph of
Young's white second wife reveals what may have been the real cause of
his arrest), his star declined, and his last days were spent iln a seedy
hotel overlooking Birdland, the New York jazz club.

Kevin,

I LOVE "Suspiria" -- a film that, it seems to me, has never received the attention it deserves (when brought up in conversation, the usual response from friends and foes alike seems to be "Suspir-wha?"). The look of the film is stunning and the music of alone is enough to give anyone the willies, though what I'm constantly haunted by is the scene in which the protagonist gets stuck in that nasty, pointy barbwire room of doom (forgive the utter lack of specificity/description -- its been several years since I've taken this in). Epic nightmares and neuroses are made of such stuff. In any case (I do have a point here), what are some other films by Argento I might take in? Recommendations? Any personal favorites?

But here in San Francisco some of us who love the films of the
Italian horror director Dario Argento were terribly excited when we
found out that he was to be the guest of honor at the 10th San Jose
Film Festival, and was slated to appear, in person, to introduce four
of his films on four consecutive days.

Dodie,

I really think there's something to that, 'paying one's dues' --- it's been good
for me, personally, in terms of being out there in the world, where people are
going to edit and interfere with and misunderstand and mock me, and also in
terms of learning how to be fair (though not necessarily 'nice') to work that
might not have me as its ideal reader. And reviewing on assignment has helped me
be a better reviewer of work that I choose myself --- helped me learn to
concretize my admiration and not just hemorrhage those adjectival plumes that
pass for 'creative criticism.'

I don't think it's 'stooping' at all, to review in the Chronicle (I've reviewed
there too) -- except to stoop into the world, which is where one ought to be at
least part of the time.

That abhorrence of the first person is common in normative academic writing as
well as journalism, and while I wish it weren't so, it is, and I think it's
worth learning those systems in order to change them - as you've said, they do
break down gradually over time.

Subject:      Re: critics/commodities

Rebecca,

One of the most mournful on this list of late, for me, has been the 'does anyone
but contributors read my zine?' thread --- b/c it contrasts so sharply with the
(admirable) ferocity sometimes displayed here re the value of a do-it-yourself
politics/aesthetics. I read this not as proving that self-styled oppositional
poets are all secretly selfish consumers, but that the ideal community is simply
hard to create, and often fails for reasons that remain mysterious.

I fail to see how anyone who SELLS a magazine or book, however tiny or matte, is
standing outside a market, or immune to its influence, and therefore more in
touch with a community, which in turn makes poetry healthier. On the other hand,
I think when you take consumerism as a given, it applies other destructive
pressures to poetry. (Am deliberately avoiding marxist jargon, but those who
insist, can translate.)

What I'm thinking of as 'civic' not 'communitarian' readership (or editorship,
or criticism) will perhaps seem burdened with odious associations -- liberalism,
democracy, etc. I can't do much about that, except to say I'm not taking these
associations as given, either. To me it stands for the move away from
'community' conceived exclusively as safety --- a place where no one disagrees
with you, market forces can't get to you, everyone knows either their Marx OR
their Daniel Bell, is writing poems either about gardening OR about class
struggle. I think, Rebecca, that when you do something like Fence you
necessarily open yourself to attack from both sides of it. Do you ever find a
community, then, except for a community of fence-sitters, seemingly more
fractious and nomadic than the rest. Well, yes! Would that I had a tribe, and
its tale to tell, and that I could do so without ever inciting someone to
alienate me from it for a profit. Whether I can, though, is to me still an open
not a closed question. My own attraction to in-betweenness has nothing to do
with aesthetic taste --- it's about the political efficacy, even the radicalism,
of remaining curious about the world.

"Every "New Critic," or neo-New Critic, as the case may be with Vendler,
is a formalist, but not vice versa. Although I do know what Mayhew is
saying when he writes that Vendler is a "New Critic," whereas Perloff is a
"Formalist," I would like the benefit of the mind that came up with this
discriminating statement. Could you, Jonathan, elaborate, on Vendler qua
"New Critic," versus Perloff qua "Formalist." "


Here is the rationale behind my perhaps pedantic distinction:

For me, the New Criticism was NOT primarily formalist; New Critics paid
relatively little attention to poetic form per se, in contrast to the
Slavic Formalists. So I don't agree that every New Critic was/is a
formalist by definition. Perloff draws, I think, on a formalist
tradition that is quite alien to Vendler's way of thinking. Now the *idea
of form figures prominently in New Criticism, standing in for certain
ideological values, but I don't think they really got around to analyzing
it beyond that. The prosodical analysis in _Understanding Poetry_ is
really quite inept.  I really can't see Jakobson and Cleanth Brooks as
sharing a common approach to poetry. I object on principal to calling
formalist a criticism that fails to take form into account, where
"formalist" is simply a code word for "non-sociological."

One thing I might add to my previous, rather confused post (someone just
walked into the office, and I was trying to write while talking to him,
tacking sentences here and there -- this is true) is that I've been
interested in collecting the writing of some of our scattered critics as
well.  The only one I've actually gotten is Steve Evans, the complete
leather-bound edition of whose Notes to Poetry can be found on my site
(http://home.earthlink.net/~bstefans/) (Before you go there, please note
that it needs a lot of work, the links are semi-dead, the "forthcoming"
projects are indeed forthcoming, but as of now are a neat pile next to my
desk.)  Anyway, I couldn't think of anyone off the top of my head who was
writing like this, with the idea of a critical project in mind, and who had
adapted his strategy so well to the new medium, or even the "coterie" aspect
of the old medium -- anyone come to mind?  I'm very open to suggestions; I
have a few ideas myself but haven't followed through.

I'm also open to anyone who wants to make an editorial contribution to the
site, by they way -- this would be in collecting, say, links for a special
page devoted to this or that.  But that's another story...

I was talking to an older, somewhat disgruntled but interesting and engaged
poet the other day, and I was surprised to hear him say that he thought this
generation of poets, meaning those about 25-35 (and mostly in New York,
since that's what he's looking at) are better poets than critics, which
struck me as surprising since I was thinking something of the opposite, but
he was mostly reading things like Publisher's Weekly, and maybe the back
section to Lingo or something.  I think the issue is pretty complicated, but
I don't think it's that important to fetishize the idea of "criticism",
especially criticism by poets, without maybe looking at the history and
asking who were, indeed, the good critic-poets, and were they ever, in fact,
writing "criticism" and not something like "theory" -- by this last term, I
mean something like Pound's "Do's and Dont's of an Imagist," which is what
"theory" (like "Symbolist" theory) used to be.  But as Bruce Andrews pointed
out to me in a conversation once, correctly, Pound didn't write about "new"
books, he mostly wrote about his previous generation, like Swinburne or
James, and occasionally would write an essay in support of a new writer,
like Joyce and Lewis, partly for polemical reasons.  (So in a sense, he was
never really a "critic" -- though his "never trust a man [sic, or need I
even mention this] who has not himself written a good work" always struck me
as quite accurate, the key term being "trust," which is what all critics
ask, but which I hesitate to give, my hope also being nobody ever trusts me
even if they like my poems.)  I actually think one of Pound's better essays
in this line, which Eliot surprisingly deemed worthy of the Selected Essays,
is the one on Williams, which is not really polemical as we know it --
hence, as it was a stretch for Pound to appreciate this sensibility that was
so different than his, it's a bit more imaginative, to me.  Anyway, who
after Pound and Eliot (and, say, before Bernstein) could be said to be
writing "criticism" -- stuff that's wide ranging, dealing with sensibilities
very different from your own (my own kind of highest goal as a critic) --
and not polemic, or theory, or broad-based statements on the state of the
art?  This isn't to say unbiassed -- all of the good critics are biassed, or
want to paint a picture (maybe create a myth, as I mentioned).  I know there
are easy answers to this -- Nathaniel Mackey immediately comes to mind (he's
fantastic and, I think, underrecognized).  I'm thinking of real-time,
play-by-play criticism, not more philosophical ruminations, which are often
useful and great to read (I like Leslie Scalapino's book by Roof, for
example, very interesting and precise, though found much of the "good stuff"
somewhat couched in various literary gestures, which perhaps I just have to
learn to read).

I love to read excellent critical writing by younger poets who either didn't
strike me as critics -- like Anselm Berrigan -- or who are fairly reticent
about pushing their views -- like Pamela Lu or Miles Champion.  Not sure if
I'd want to ask these people to do more than they're doing; it seems that if
a piece of critical writing is a mere side event to one's engagement with
the art, it's often quite good, but once people get a little vain or start
to wield that sledge-hammer of cultural capital (and they won't, without a
doubt), it can crumble a bit, especially when it tries to hard to be witty,
which is tough in criticism.

To go back to my last post, I think part of my problem with bigger journals,
as well, is the timetable they operate on -- things sit around for months,
even years, since space is limited, budgets are limited, etc.  I have an
essay I wrote two years ago, a monster on Asian American poetry, which I
finished in the summer of 98, which is basically a dated contraption right
now; my little essay on Moxley is sweating it out in an editor's drawer, and
I've had some things on which I spent much time on, and which were
comissioned, rejected by editors since they didn't fit the model.  Anyway,
so with one's limited resouces -- running a small business is time
consuming -- one ceases to aspire to that timetable, or to those "heights";
consequently, the silenct upon publication is deafening, a big "who cares?"
seems to loom out of the distance.  Lastly, I think that I have a fear of
print these days, the internet just seeming to be a more alive place to put
words; I can't help but think that words _stop_ when they are in print, they
seem kind of helpless there (not to connect myself with a great writer like
Proust, but I think he had a similar instinct; he was notorious for filling
in all the white spaces between the lines of the printer's proofs, probably
because the words just seemed to waver before his eyes).

Anyway, touch of insomnia this early Tuesday morning... Brian

Thanks for mentioning the essay on translation that cites Blanchot. It seems
that, in the quote included in the post, Blanchot is saying that, by
compounding the distance between the original text and the reader, the
translation makes obvious the gulf, at once present and absent, that always
exists between any text and its reader. Talk of Blanchot in this context
reminds me of the comment Blanchot-translator Robert Lamberton makes in a
note included in his version of 'Thomas the Obscure'. Lamberton relates that
Blanchot, in response to Lydia Davis' translation of his 'L'Arret de mort',
stressed, after acknowledging the importance of her role, the fact that
'Death Sentence' should ultimately be regarded as a work by Lydia Davis.
I'll have to look for the Xcp essay.

I have just been looking in Xcp4 at "The Guest of Literature:
The Issue of Hospitality in Literary Translation," by Piotr Gwiazda.
It opens with Blanchot's remark, "We do not see why the act of
the translator should not be appreciated as the quintessential
literary act, one which proposes that the reader remain ignorant
of the text it reveals to him and from which his ignorance will
not distance him.  Instead, it will bring him closer by becoming
active, by representing to him the great interval that separates
him from it."  Gwiazda notes "the deep difficulty of accepting
translation as a distinct type of literature," then comments,
"Blanchot's words propose a displacement of translation from the
shadow of literature, or rather the shadow *between* literatures,
where it looms as both familiar and alien, close and remote, welcome
and unwelcome; where it sojourns as a guest.  Translation implies
an almost political process of balancing and negotiation; a transfer;
a difference."  Gwiazda frames the rest of the essay around the
way that readers approach translation suspiciously--with "the
vigilance which is not unlike the typical treatment of a stranger,
a foreigner, and most of all--a guest."

--an interesting piece & worth looking up, anyway

Edible Book?  Lewis McAdams back in the sixties read a poem from a cookie
tin--each letter had been backed, so when he was through he threw.
He threw the letters to the audience and they ate the poem.
That was back in the daze of the Electronic Poetry Workshop.

Rebecca & Brian (Lennon) et al.
        Rebecca, the page in a consumerist context:  I agree.  In fact, those
doing corporate-model production and those doing cottage-industry
production, so long as they are self-conscious about why they are both able
and willing to engage in these forms of publication, are really preaching
the same verse(s), as far as I can tell.  The argument against one or
another on an aesthetic program, I think, is rather pointless in terms of
the "conversion" notion, which Brian brought up.
        Experimental forms of writing, editing, and publishing seem to be about
preaching convertibility, not conversion, if this makes any sense.
Distribution is not at all a separate issue, either, and so I'm impatient
with efforts to convert "tried-and-true" circuits of distribution to the
gospel, so to speak.
        But, I want to ask both of you, and anyone else reading in:  I fail to see
how aesthetics are not implicated, indeed entirely bound up with, as Brian
writes, "the political efficacy, even the radicalism, of remaining curious
about the world"?

A sexist game?  You're being too modest, Marjorie: Vendler is the most
visible critic of American non-innovative-since-Eliot poetry, you the
most visible critic of American innovative-up-to-1980 poetry.  That's
why comparing the two of you is amusing.

Sure: why is visual poetry still pretty much ignored by publications
with circulations above a few hundred?

Comments on the Harper's of about a year ago that gave a few pages to
poetry might be interesting, too.

How about whether the panel thinks the later half of the twentieth
century America produced a set of poets at the level of Pound, Eliot,
Cummings, Jeffers, Williams and Stevens in the earlier half of the
twentieth century.

 "Every "New Critic," or neo-New Critic, as the case may be with Vendler,

 "Formalist," I would like the benefit of the mind that came up with this
 discriminating statement. Could you, Jonathan, elaborate, on Vendler qua
 "New Critic," versus Perloff qua "Formalist." "


 Here is the rationale behind my perhaps pedantic distinction:

 For me, the New Criticism was NOT primarily formalist; New Critics paid
 relatively little attention to poetic form per se, in contrast to the
 Slavic Formalists. So I don't agree that every New Critic was/is a
 formalist by definition. Perloff draws, I think, on a formalist
 tradition that is quite alien to Vendler's way of thinking. Now the *idea
 of form figures prominently in New Criticism, standing in for certain
 ideological values, but I don't think they really got around to analyzing
 it beyond that. The prosodical analysis in _Understanding Poetry_ is
 really quite inept.  I really can't see Jakobson and Cleanth Brooks as
 sharing a common approach to poetry. I object on principal to calling
 formalist a criticism that fails to take form into account, where
 "formalist" is simply a code word for "non-sociological."

Thank you for your elaboration. This is pretty much what I thought you'd say.
Your statement that the New Criticism was not "formalist" is most provacative
indeed. I think part of the problem here revolves around my pinpointing
formalism as a "slippery term." I want to stick by my statement that every
New Critic is a "formalist" but not vice versa. My rationale? You are
designating formalist as criticism that addresses poetic form. In this case I
definitely see your point. Maybe the closest Eliot gets on form to Jakobson
on Baudelaire's "Les Chats" is on conceit, which is more or less a grain of
sand next to an ocean. You then write that you object on "principle" (I'm
curious on knowing your principle (by the way this is not at all written in a
hostile tone)) that you object to using "formalist" to label criticism that
is "'non-sociological'." However, most people will agree, that "formalist"
criticism also encompasses "content" concerneed criticicism; hence, the New
Critics would fall into the "formalist" camp. I hope this clarifies my
position that all New Criticism is formalalist but not vice versa. I'd like
to open up this discussion to anyone else who'd jump in.

Ramez

I think Kevin listed some of HIS recommendations at the end of his post.  My
recommendations are:

   _Phenomena_ (a.k.a. _Creepers)
   _Deep Red_ (a.k.a. _Profundo Rosso_)
   _Opera_ (a.k.a. _Terror at the Opera_)

Two of his films disturb me a little because of their depiction of violence
against women; these are _Tenebrae_ (a.k.a. _Unsane_), one of Kevin's
recommendations, and the recent _Stendhal Syndrome_.  What disturbs me about
these movies is that they seem to eroticize violence against women a little
more blatently (to my mind) than his other films. I realize I may be
splitting hairs here, since all of Argento's films contain depictions of
women being murdered-- and horror films generally link sexual activity to
being a murder victim (c.f. _Scream_).  Then again, at least SOME of DA's
movies have strong-- albeit young-- female heroes who survive (_Suspiria_,
_Phenomena_).

Argento is an interesting filmmaker: his actors rarely act well, yet he pays
meticulous attention to the visual image.  His plots are poorly constructed,
yet the build-up of suspense & tension in his best films is near-brilliant.
Obviously he holds this wierd fascination for some of us.  How to account
for that, I cannot entirely explain.

I tried to get my students to work with fairytales in their poems, Kathy
Lou, and one just told a joke instead. Which had to do with Cinderella
needing one last thing for the ball -- a TAMPON. Fairygodmom turned a
pumpkin into one. When the clock struck Cindy tried to run to the bathroom
"I really really gotta go!" but her dance partner begged for her name at
least. "Cinderella". His "Peter Pumpkin Eater". She -- no more worries.

Marjorie,

Aldon's post _was_ great, wasn't it?

AS FOR my post:

        I shouldn't have said anything.  Sorry.

Against my own wishes, I'm getting to be known as some sort of
anti-Perloffian when that's hardly the case.

MY PLEDGE: After this post, I will never mention your name on this list.

All I was doing was responding to Steven Shoemaker, who wrote that he

        "thought of Vendler and Perloff as matter and antimatter."

That still seems to me a not-very-helpful image, but I should have
questioned the whole binary opposition explicitly instead of trying to set
up a different one from another perspective.  As I tried (uselessly it
appears) to explain on the list, similarity/dissimilarity is largely a
matter of perspective.

AS FOR sexism, I'll have to think about that.  Seriously.

I think such charges should not be taken lightly, but neither should they be
made lightly.

Would it have been better to have compared Charles Bernstein to J.D.
McClatchy?  But nobody said they were matter and antimatter; there was
nothing to respond to.

I think the reason nobody mentioned Bloom is that nobody cares what Bloom
thinks anymore, at least about contemporary poetry.   Your opinion and
Vendler's matter now in a way that Bloom's don't.

AS FOR twins: As I have said before, YOU'RE THE GOOD ONE.

And who the hell is Michael Scharf?

              Anthology
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Swell review, thanks Brian Stefans.  Just a note to say that in Vancouver
there's not much agreement about the historical account in the introduction
to this book, particularly the suggested relations between KSW & the IWW.
Also, "the Giantesses" refer to writers & visual artists Maxine Gadd, Rhoda
Rosenfeld, Renee Rodin, Judith Copithorne, Jamila Ismail & Trudi
Rubenfeld--they predate KSW, they were never a sub-group of it.  The phrase
is mistakenly used in the book to identify Lisa Robertson, Catriona Strang,
Susan Clark & Christine Stewart.  Ah, well.

It's true that the anthology doesn't include supplementary theoretical
statements.  But I do think that the genre of the manifeso was important to
many involved--see "Coasting" by Robertson, Strang, Jeff Derksen & Nancy
Shaw (in Exact Change Yearbook 1995, A Poetics of Criticism, or Open Letter
9:3) & "Barscheit Nation" by Robertson, Strang & Stewart (in Barscheit 4,
Mirage#4/Period(ical) 14, Writing from the New Coast: Technique, or
Semiotexte Canadas).  The notion that theoretical discourse was under
suspicion in Vancouver, that it "played into the norms of class rule," isn't
accurate--the Artist/Writer/Talks series in the late 80s & a set of panel
discussions on translation, everyday life, the self, etc. in the early 90s
are evidence of this.  None of these talks or panels have been published or
transcribed, so the impression of an anti-theoretical climate is sort of
understandable.  Also, much of the "theoretical" writing by these people is
articulated through studies of visual art & culture--Mittenthal on Gary
Hill, Culley on Stan Douglas, Robertson & Shaw on architecture & suburbs,
for example--often in journals and catalogues published at a distance from
writing/poetry communities.  The significance of the New Poetics Colloquium
in 1985 could have been played up more in the introduction to the
anthology--those tapes are still here if some graduate student in Buffalo is
seeking a thesis.  Call KSW at 604-688-6001.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Hi Ramez,

Well, I wasn't going to do this, in part because I was only at two of the
three days, but also because I was completely exhausted -- burnt-out -- at
each. Also, I'm posting too much this month, and this will be kind of
involved & long ... but it doesn't look like anyone else is going to, so ...
forgive the lackluster prose (I'm going on vacation next week -- the first
in at least a year & a half) ...

Anyway. As usual, I tried to do too many things on the weekend: wound up
going to two movies, two of the Issue Zero events, and doing another cartoon
for Rain Taxi (which is why I missed Issue Zero on Sunday). I can't separate
the movies or even the cartoon from my feelings about the conference, in
part simply due to proximity, but also because there were some interesting
(to me, anyway) correspondences ...

The Friday night Church event wasn't scheduled until 10:30 (I think there
are church services before that), so I went to see "SEX: The Annabel Chong
Story" with Greg Fuchs. It was a very oddly constructed biography, in that
for the first 45 minutes, I was convinced it was basically a PR flick for
the porno industry. After that, though, things got a little more intense.
Grace Quek (aka Annabel Chong) is a complicated person, to say the least.
She got into porn at the time she was going to grad school in southern
California, as a gender studies major, I think. The initial impulse, or so
it was described, was a kind of backlash to some of the more
stifling/prudish elements in the Department. She had always been fairly
promiscuous (a "stud," as she calls herself), and decided "why not make
money doing what I love?" She does well in the porno industry, becoming a
huge star after fucking 251 guys in 10 hours for very well-publicized
gang-bang video: which was also the largest selling porno video of all time:
40,000 copies. I was shocked by how low that number was! Were they talking
about a small press magazine? I don't think I misheard that number, either,
because Greg heard it as 40,000 copies as well. (If anyone knows otherwise,
please let me know.) She was supposed to be paid $10,000 for the event, but
she wasn't, and after considering a legal battle, ultimately decided against
it. "I didn't do it for the money, anyway," she says. (And, considering that
she was only going to get $10,000 for this, which probably wouldn't last a
year in soCal, I almost believe her.) At some point, Quek travels back to
Singapore to visit her family, and reveal to them what she's been doing in
America. After revealing this to her mother, who is intially blown away by
the information, crying uncontrollably, she decides to quit the porno
industry. But, back in America, the movie ends with her going off to the
studio to try out again, after more than a year's absence from the industry.

It's kind of a sad movie; what's saddest about it, I guess, is how Quek sort
of goes from this at least intellectually distanced person w/respect to the
industry, to just another cog in it. As Greg and I talked about it later,
the issue of feminism came up, and whether or not Quek is really taking
power, or what that power really is, as well as its limits, given that the
industry is run by men, and that the audience is predominantly male. She
talks about the gang bang as a kind of "fuck you" to the industry, to
"standards," etc., and it's not convincing: as Greg said, some of Quek's
rhetoric was kind of like the things you might hear someone say about their
not-particularly intellectually stimulating performance art. (I love
performance art, but, there's always the person very vocal about operating
"in opposition" to cultural blah blah blah, I mean, it's become a cliche, I
guess.) Anyway, we both were curious what others might say about the movie,
about Quek, and I guess this is sort of plea for anyone to write about it
(here, or backchannel) ...

So, I got to the conference late, 11:00 p.m., and it hadn't started yet. I
was still back in Annabel Chong World, even as everyone sort of settled in
and the panel got underway. After a brief introduction by Regie Cabico,
Brendan Lorber opened things up with an on-the-spot sort of gloss on where
he & Douglas Rothschild had gotten the Zero of Issue Zero. My memory has it
that some of the ideas floating around were small press' relative
invisibility, but also starting from scratch I guess, as well as "publishing
in 2000" ...

First to speak was Michael Rothenberg from the online zine, Big Bridge,
edited by himself and Wanda Phipps. He began with a prepared statement, the
editorial statement you can find in the magazine itself: "We think walls are
good for keeping out the cold and rain. And for displaying some art. They're
useless in the creation and propagation of art. We don't care if Language
poetry appears next to sonnets, or haiku next to spoken word and workshop
poetry beside agit-smut. Our tastes are catholic—even though we're Jews and
pagans and Buddhists and libertines and run-of-the-mill Christians. We don't
care how art is shaped—round like moon, flat like roadkill, angular like
love, twisted like political promises. We hear many voices (even when we're
taking our meds) and are guided by whimsy and passion and urgency. We want
more." He also talked about the history of his own publishing, which I think
began with finer press stuff, which ultimately became too expensive to
continue producing. The talked a bit about what's on the site, mentioning in
particular the chapbooks by Philip Whalen, Joanne Kyger, Robert Creeley and
Jack Collom. He described Big Bridge as a kind of bridge not only between
writers of various aesthetic impulses/concerns, but also between print and
internet culture, because they actively seek out people who do not
necessarily publish on (or even look at) the web.

Next was Emilie Clark from _Shark_. She described the magazine, which
includes poetics and visual art and statements by visual artists, but "no
poetry" (that got hisses from the audience, but not *real* hisses). She
talked a bit about how some of the artist's statements they'd gotten read
more like poetry than anything else, which I think is something she
values -- she had also made the point, a bit earlier, about how most
magazines dealing with art do tend to be connected with the gallery/museum
system, and often serve primarily as PR for various art careers and, even
more so, for galleries & museums. Which is why I'd let my subscription to
Art News lapse many years ago, actually, just that feeling. I think Emilie
also mentioned what is no doubt a commonplace among small magazine
publishers: Beginning as a quarterly, or twice yearly, and winding up doing
a twice yearly or annual. I think _Shark_ itself may have started as a
quarterly and wound up being a twice yearly, but I'm not positive about
that.

Next up was Robert Hershon, from Hanging Loose. I remember from his talk
that the magazine had originally been, literally, "hanging loose": it wasn't
bound, so you could do, he said, whatever you wanted with the poems. Hang
them up on the wall or refrigerator, etc. Though he didn't say it, my guess
is that Hershon's impulse might have been to have the poems seen/read more
as individual entities than as part of the mix? Maybe. He described the
difficulty of trying to get them into Gotham Book Mart, that they had to
make a display copy for each issue, which *was* bound, with a little note on
it saying that actual copies weren't bound, and that if you wanted one, you
had to ask the person behind the counter. He described the various
frustrations with running a magazine, and said that by issue 50 (they're now
on 75) he was prepared to quit, and just do books, because they're easier as
far as distribution, mainly because they have no "expiration date." But, his
coeditors talked him out of it. He also talked about how they'd come up with
the idea of publishing teenage poets in the magazine -- I can't remember
whose idea it was (not Hershon's), but Hershon was against it at first,
argued vehemently against it, but was outvoted, and now really loves the
idea, and has apparently published books by a number of poets who first
published with Hanging Loose in the "teen" section. (I think Joanna Furhman,
whose book is due out very soon, is one of them.)

Amy Fussel (?) of Bunny Rabbit was next. I'm embarrassed to admit that I
don't know her last name. (Someone please help.) Bunny Rabbit is a personal
zine, on the order of Rebecca Levi's _Your Head on a Platter_, Nancy
Bonnell-Kangas' _Nancy's Magazine_ or Arielle Greenberg's _William Wants a
Doll_. Most of Amy's talk was about promotion of one kind or another, and
the spirit, as someone said on the list here a day or so ago, of "do it
yourself." (Brian Lennon? I think.) She had a couple of marvelous anecdotes,
not about herself, but about how others had managed to "infiltrate" various
markets or audiences. One involved an Italian artist who had gone to the
printer who prints up the Italian version of Artforum and somehow convinced
him or her to print up *his* cover for one of the issues. And the printer
apparently did this. "I love that," Amy said. She talked also about
McSweeny's, which I guess is edited by a guy who's since become famous,
having a best-selling memoir out ... and apparently he's on a reading tour
now, and brings along copies of the magazine to sell as well as the book,
and really promotes it at his readings. "I love that," Amy said. I *don't*
think Amy talked much about her magazine's contents, though I think it's
largely her way of getting her writing and cartoons out into the world. I
wanted a copy of the magazine really bad, largely based on Amy's personality
(she was very energetic, funny), but by the time I got to speak to her,
she'd run out. But, she promised to go to the Saturday event, and to bring
along copies in exchange for some books I'd bring her.

Jordan Davis and Chris Edgar from _The Hat_ were up next. I don't think they
said much about the magazine; Jordan said he was coming down with something,
and was exhausted, so that they were just going to read work from the
magazine. I remember a poem by Steve Malmude, but I didn't make notes, and
am hazy on what else was read, I want to say something by Alyssa Quart, too,
but that may have been by another editor ... I do remember, though, Erik
Sweet's "Black Smurf," which I guess startled or disturbed someone sitting
in the front row enough that they made a fairly loud comment about it. Erik
Sweet, who was there with Lori Quillen, was sitting a row or two behind the
guy, and I think either Jordan or Chris pointed this out, maybe as well as
the fact that Erik's rather tall, kind of husky. It was a nice moment; I
like that someone would just blurt out what they thought of something. (And
Erik, I think, was kind of flattered that his poem upset someone so much.)

Tom Devaney spoke on behalf of _Skanky Possum_. His first comment was
directed at Michael Rothenberg who, if you'll remember, said "We don't care
how art is shaped—round like moon, flat like roadkill ..." Tom objected to
Michael's use of "roadkill" and held up a copy of _Skanky_, revealing what
looked from 6 or 7 rows back like a possum staring into the lights of an
oncoming car. Everyone laughed. Tom then talked about the history of the
magazine, how there had been _Mike and Dale's_, and that Mike and Dale had
gone off to do different projects, Dale with Hoa on _Skanky_ and Mike on
_Blue Notebook_ (?). He described how the magazine is put together, with
hand-painted covers, during collating parties. I missed part of this talk
because I had to use the restroom & really couldn't wait. He also said that
Skanky was a press, too, publishing: Frank O'Hara's _What's with Modern
Art?_, Hoa Nguyen's _Dark_, Carl Thayler's _Naltsus Bichidin_ and Leslie
Davis's _Lucky Pup_. I think Hershon may have made a comment then, or maybe
Devaney did, about how, yes, it was very tempting for magazine publishers to
get into doing books.

Last this evening was Steve Cannon, from _Gathering of the Tribes_. Steve is
blind, and during his talk, which was a kind of rambling personal history as
well as a history of the magazine itself, talked about going blind, which
happened to him as an adult, after he'd become involved in the magazine. The
magazine seemed to have come out of the various reading series Steve was
going to or otherwise involved in, and at one point, and I'm not sure about
this but my memory has it that it was prior to the first issue's coming out,
his apartment building burnt down, and he found himself homeless. Friends
helped him out, going so far as helping him with the magazine as well. I
thought about what it would be like going blind and having this enormous
enthusiasm for editing a magazine. What would you do? How would you continue
to participate? *Would* you continue? I think Steve gets people to read
contributions to him. There's also a gallery (!) and a website. Pretty
amazing.

Brendan then asked if anyone had any questions. Doug asked if I had any
questions, I don't know why he singled me out, I may have looked like I
wanted to ask something, which I actually did, but for some reason didn't
just then. (I wanted to know what kind of material Amy was publishing in
Bunny Rabbit -- all I knew at that point was that it was her own work.)
Someone finally had a question, and Regie brought the mic to them. The
question had to do with how much unsolicited material the editors wound up
taking, and everyone came on the number 10% of unsolicited work, except for
Michael, who said 50%, since it's a webzine. I tried to imagine what amount
of unsolicited work I take for Readme, was it that high? and couldn't really
figure it out, though I think it's actually less than 50%. The next question
had to do with "trends" in poetry: Did any of the editors see any kind of
trends? Michael said no, "thank goodness," and then hesitated and said that,
really, what he was seeing was a kind of confluence of styles within any one
particular poets' writing. Douglas said: "Oh, so Pound, so The Cantos are
new." Either Doug or someone else said _Paterson_. I don't remember all of
the discussion that followed this comment (maybe someone else will be
prompted to join in).

During everyone's talk, or most everyone's, I was of course also thinking
about the movie I had just seen, as well as what I was going to do for my
own presentation on Saturday. I could go on & on about various correlations
between the Chong movie and the panel discussion, not to equate the two
systems (porno industry & small press world), but definitely my own feelings
about almost everyone's talk were somewhat colored by having just seen that
movie.

I'll post Saturday's event as a separate email ... and hope others will
provide their own takes on what happened, as well as fill in the enormous
blanks, & correct whatever errors, are in this one ...

Anyone know a good, poet-friendly accountant -- someone inexpensive, but who
could help optimize returns (via 18th-century loopholes that let non-married
poets with certain neo-classical sensibilities and bad food addictions get
extra breaks).

Please backchannel... thanks.

I am spinning off of the last line of Alan Sondheim's post, quoted
below.

The 'other' seems always to be implicated in some for of "talking to" or
discourse. I imagine who you are and you imagine who I am and those
imagined othernesses or differences inform what we have to say to one
another. Otherness comes more deeply into play if I am an anthropologist
and you are the subject of my investigation, still it is mediated by
discourse and that sense otherness may be more or less embodied through
various mediated realties (interactive cyber realities), just as a guru
or Jack Spicer might be a medium for embodying otherness.

I am beset by two questions though. What about embodied subjectivity? Oh
Whitman surely had this in the scope of his subjectivity, as some have
noted. This was my rational for the objectifying subjectivity thread.

My second question concerns gender. What permits or enables me in my
projections of my sense of the differences at play in any bit of
discourse to embody differences that are perverse, that cross gender
norms, etc.? You see I am looking for something other than an
essentialist answer to this question. Another version of the same
question: is mimicry even possible anymore? Or is it always an insult?

Subject:      Issue Zero Conference (Saturday Night)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Okay, I don't know if this will give anyone a sense of anything more than
just how bad my memory is, just how burnt-out I am, or what, but ...

Saturday, I tried to prepare for my talk, and based it largely on the talks
of the night before, which had mostly been personal history kind of things.
I thought more about Steve Cannon, because I couldn't remember, and it just
seemed amazing: Is he really blind? Had I just extrapolated that from his
wearing sunglasses at the talk? Made it all up? It seemed too amazing to be
real, and, you know, it wouldn't be beyond me to spin out some fantasy like
that, based on a piddly clue like wearing sunglasses indoors. (He was seated
the whole time I saw him.) But, I just thought, as I was writing down a few
notes, how banal my own history was, and not really sure if I should even
talk about it. Just before leaving for the conference, I tried to get hold
of Drew Gardner, because I wanted to see if he'd go see Mike Kuchar's "The
Craven Sluck" and "Sins of the Fleshapoids" at Millennium after the
conference.

I got there early and only Suzi Winson had arrived. People began showing up,
and I saw Amy from Bunny Rabbit, and we traded zines for books, and I asked
her if she knew of Nancy's Magazine, because most personal zinesters know
about it, and sure enough she did. Not only that, but she also knew or knew
of this whole sort of scene there in Columbus, Ohio, where Nancy lives.
Finally, the place filled up and things got going.

Melanie Nielsen and Deidre Kovacs went first, beginning with a prepared
statement about Big Allis, talking about how Jessica Grim had first been
involved, and how Deidre was now working with Melanie instead. There were
lists of numbers, how many people they'd published, how many pages (600+ I
think), and how long they'd been going, more than 10 years I think. Then
they read first something by Jerry Estrin and then something by Hannah
Weiner.

My memory being what it isn't right now, I may have the order wrong, but
next I believe was Jenn and Chris McCreary from Ixnay. They talked about I
think wanting to begin publishing books, but someone wound up doing a
magazine as well. They read a few things from the magazine, including a
piece by Pattie McCarthy, and I want to say Ethel Rackin, but not sure about
that. Someone who kept better notes could tell you.

Suzi Winsom was next, from Fish Drum. She talked about the origin of the
name, and I think a bit about the kinds of work they're publishing. I don't
think she read the note that's on their website, but here it is in absence
of my own ability to describe what *was* said: "Fish Drum exemplifies the
exuberant, talky, often elliptical and abstract 'continuous nerve movie'
that follows the working mind and has a relationship to the world and the
reader. Fish Drum has a soft spot for schmoozy, emotional, imagistic
stuff... also literate, personal material that sings and surprises...a place
to discover zen oddities, carnivores, assorted larvae, immolation craters
and wayward dragons." Philip Whalen fans will recognize "continuous nerve
movie" from one of his descriptions of his own writing, and the first poem
Suzi read was one of Whalen's. Again, no notes, and I don't recall what else
was read. (*Please* someone who was there, fill this in!)

Next was Jena Osman from Chain, who began by talking about how the first
issue was put together: a sort of chain letter, where one person wrote
something, sent it along to another writer, the second writer wrote
something in response, and it was sent back, or on to a third writer, and so
on. I can't remember if Jena mentioned the Gender and Editing section of
that issue, or not. She read several things, brief excerpts, from pieces,
pretty wonderful, from the magazine. I think one was Steve Carll's "Another
Hermeneutics" (I'm looking at their website now to help jog my memory) ...

Speaking of which, I'm not sure who came next at all, so this really isn't
in any particular order. But, let's just say it was Erik Sweet and Lori
Quillen from Tool A Magazine. They basically said that their editorial
policy was "we publish what we like" which may actually appear in the
magazine, too, on the copyright page. They read Jordan Davis's "He Is
Lightning," and work by Laird Hunt, and I'm not sure, I wonder if *they*
weren't the ones who read the Alyssa Quart piece. I'm kind of thinking yeah.

Macgregor Card did a whole sort of "visual aid" / performance thing for The
Germ. He passed out copies of "Goblin Market," and got everyone to read
along. "We're all -- small press publishers -- kind of a goblin market," he
said. I couldn't really see all the visual stuff from where I was sitting
(off to one side, and bad lighting in the bar). He was pretty effusive, fun.

Max Winter was there on behalf of Fence. He talked a bit about the
aesthetics of the magazine, of a real or perceived "fence" between the
mainstream & elsewhere, and said the magazine existed to bring both of the
two worlds into dialog with each other. He read several things, again really
nice, but I didn't take notes! and don't remember who they were by.

David Cameron spoke on behalf of 6500. I saw copies of the mag there, on a
table, they were pretty gorgeous. He gave a prepared statement that had been
sent to him, kind of a humorous statement about accepting work only by
redheads, but now opening up the magazine to people without red hair (either
bald, or with hair color other than red). I don't remember that he read any
work from the magazine.

I went on last, and, based on everyone's reading work from their magazines
at this event, completely abandoned my earlier plan to give a "history." I
read a passage from Jack Smith's _Historical Treasures_, where he talks
about calling up the Village Voice and asking if he can review his upcoming
theatrical performance, and being told, finally, "If we let you do it,
everyone would want to do it." To which Smith says (to his readers) "If
everyone wanted it, isn't that the point ... to have something that everyone
wants?" I said this was basically the spirit in which we were all working,
though I didn't (as I'd planned) elaborate. I listed the people who'd been
interviewed & who were now being interviewed for the mag, and basically said
it was a poetics mag. I completely forgot to talk about what *kind* of
poetics mag (an informal poetics mag, largely inspired by Film Culture, my
all time favorite magazine of any kind). I read three things, a brief
portion of an interview with Mark Jacobs that Peter Balestrieri did (which I
won't say anything about here, since it'll be in the next issue), and a poem
of Daniel Davidson's, and then a section from Nada Gordon's poem "essay."
When I announced the poem, Nada yelled out: "You're going to read a love
poem written to you from your girlfriend?!?" To which I reminded her of the
Jack Smith thing I'd just read ... then read from Nada's poem, and that was
that.

Forgive my horrendous memory and lack of notes. I'm really hoping others
will flesh these pale attempts out with their own obvservations. I felt bad
about my own presentation, mainly because I didn't say what I should have
said about the mag, and also that I managed to mostly avoid the microphone
up until the very end, but the Kuchar movies cheered me up. And, again,
these were related in my mind to the whole conference, given Kuchar's
totally d.i.y. approach, his use of friends, making movies that *he* really
wanted to see (or in one case that the star wanted to see -- there was a 12
minute recent short that Kuchar ended with, which hadn't been announced).

Looking back on the conference as a whole, or at least these two days, I was
most surprised by the lack of anyone's kind of pointing to previous examples
of magazines that had inspired them(positively or negatively). Why had I
forgotten to mention Film Culture? Maybe Michael Rothenberg or Bob Hershon
talked about this a bit ... I do remember one of them very briefly
discussing the general "magazine situation" around the time they began
publishing. Anyway, this would have been something I'd liked to have heard
about.

Oh, I remember telling Brian Stefans that "I sucked," after he very nicely
said "that was good." I meant it, but he said that it did give him some
sense of community, so I guess that's good. It's true, though, thinking back
on it, that the Saturday people talked less about this than the Friday night
people; it seemed maybe to be more of a compelling issue for some of the
older publishers there (Cannon and Rothenberg in particular). Anyway, this
bleeds into Sunday, why I missed the Sunday conference: I was doing this
cartoon all about community; specifically, sort of just recognizing various
Brooklyn poets that I know & hang out with. I'd had huge problems doing this
thing, have been working on it for over a month now, beginning and then
having to throw the thing away (four, five times). I couldn't get people to
look like themselves! & worse, the drawings themselves were just awful. So,
I was struggling to get this thing on community done and actually *missed*
being with one, Sunday -- kind of ironic. I did finally manage to finish the
cartoon, but only because I hit on this idea: instead of doing drawings of
my friends, do drawings of sketchbook drawings of them! It worked.

This (this email) should have been over long ago, but Saturday night, there
was a party at Sean Killian's, and a number of the magazine people showed
up; I guess it was party for the mag conference. I went with Drew, after the
movies, and met Nada there. We talked mostly with Brendan, who brought up
the thing Rothenberg had said Friday night, about no particular style, or
poets working a kind of confluence of styles, and said he really found that
to be one of the most exciting things about current writing. We talked about
other things, too (he was determined not to leave the wicker chair he had
plopped down in, and didn't); I remember at one point asking him about
writers from I guess Elinor Nauen or Greg Masters' generation, what was
happening with them, if he'd read much of their stuff, if they were still
active, or what ...

Okay. I'm babbling. Hope someone, at the very least, will describe Sunday
...

The Blanchot essay derives from Walter Benjamin's "Task of the
Translator," in fact if it is the essay I am thinking of it is actually
about this Benjamin essay. The idea that translation is the
quintessentially literary act is also found in Borges's essay, "Las
versiones homericas," which has the peculiarity of comparing English
tranlsations of Homer without quoting these translations in English. In
other words, he compares his own translations into Spanish of Chapman,
Pope, etc... Very weird.  Borges thought the prejudice against translation
a superstition based on the repetetitive reading of classical texts.  We
cannot imagine the text different than it is because it is too familiar to
us.

I've been checking the downloads from the Witz site, and I find that
although lots of people have downloaded the new issue and the more recent
issues, hardly anyone has picked up Witz 1.2. So, even though it's eight
years old, I just wanted to put a good word in for it. There's a great piece
by John High on the Moscow poetry scene circa 1992 (which seems more than a
little sad now), an extensive interview with Steve McCaffery (by Clint
Burnham), and reviews of books by Anne Tardos, Barry Silesky, Rochelle
Owens, and Stephen-Paul Martin (they're the authors, not the reviewers).

The direct link to the issue (in PDF format, so it's easy to print out and
read) is:

Subject:      Report: Perloff/Vendler/Burt/Scharf: Poetry Criticism: What Is It
              For? 3.15.2000, NYC

A few notes before settling down at this library terminal for the day.
Short-term memory has never been good, and my retelling is highly colored,
I'm sure, by my own views, so I welcome correction/elaboration from anyone
mentioned here.

-------------------------

Perloff/Vendler/Burt/Scharf: Poetry Criticism: What Is It For? 3.15.2000,
NYC

There, but where, how? One of those premature spring evenings that 3 years
away from NYC made so much more ephemeral, & to be savored. Walked down to
Cooper Union from the 8 St N stop without my usual irritation at diagonal
wanderers, friends chatting three abreast, cellphone screamers, and other
sidewalk traffic.

Once there, about 200(?) people, filling all seats, a few sitting in
aisles. Aura of anticipation.

Each of the four panelists either gave a paper (Burt, Scharf) or spoke
largely ex tempore (Perloff, Vendler). Susan Wheeler moderated.

Of the four, Perloff and Scharf were most committed to the idea that
poetry journalism, reviewing and/or criticism was in a crisis. Burt had
complaints of a slightly different nature. Vendler admitted that she'd
been lucky to have as much space as she wanted (in The New Yorker and
elsewhere) to write what she wanted to write, and so had worked in a place
of high privilege.

Stephen Burt spoke first. Among other things, he suggested (as best I can
paraphrase) that it's not such a big deal to write poetry scholarship one
day, a poetry review for a poetry-literate audience the next, and a poetry
review for a so-called "general" audience on the third day, or indeed to
be juggling all these tasks at the same time. By "not such a big deal," I
mean he implied that these stand for a set of skills one can acquire and
use without getting tangled in the ideology of which one of them ought
properly to exclude the others. Different audiences simply exist, in other
words, and can be written for. He also said that one problem with poetry
reviewing is that editors don't allot enough wordspace to reviews, and
that they often resist the reviewer's discussion of formal or other
technical intricacies of a poem (use of the line, for example).

Marjorie Perloff noted that although the state of poetry reviewing and
criticism in general-circ publications is presently dismal, there probably
was no Golden Age when it was much better. Go back and look at the New
York Times Book Review from the turn of the century, she said. What *is*
different, she seemed to say, is the quality or quantity of engagement in
tiny elite publications today, compared to those of the high modernist
period. She used the phrase "putting oneself on the line" several times to
signify the (productive) combativeness of modernist poetry reviewing, &
suggested that contemporary reviewers in the tiny magazines are "too
polite" in comparison. And also that what's crucial in vital criticism is
a mix of sympathy and distance -- she used Brian Henry reviewing Charles
Bernstein as an example. The idea being that people of the same
political-aesthetic community often review each other badly out of an
excess of sympathy, and people too far apart, community-wise, review each
other badly out of ignorance of each other's essential contexts.

Michael Scharf sounded a similar note in his talk. Lyric or
"self"-centered poetry, he said, is better-selling and (not
coincidentally) more extensively reviewed than what he called "recent
alternatives to the lyric," and so there has developed a kind of
literary-journalistic "shorthand" that allows one to say someting about a
book of lyric poems in a short space (say, 300-800 words) without having
to first establish each term of the discussion in its historical context.
There's no such general journalistic shorthand for poetry that challenges
the premises of the lyric, he seemed to say, and so not only is the stuff
more often passed over for review (we're talking about general-circ organs
like, e.g., NYTBR) but the reviewer often can't get anywhere in the
alloted wordspace. He implied (though it may just be me reading-in) that
the frustration of this encourages reviewers of "recent alternatives to
lyric" to retire into mainly sympathetic closed communities ---e.g.,
tiny-circ journals --- where their voices aren't getting heard by anyone
but their (actual or potential) friends.

Helen Vendler spoke anecdotally about how one could, so to speak, fall in
love with or acquire a religious feeling for writing *about* poetry as
much as with or for the poetry itself. She talked about a kind of
"closed-circuit" relation between the poet and critic, which in her
experience was often most compelling when it was most focused and
seemingly exclusive of some (not all) aspects of world-context. Criticism
that can be imagined to please or have pleased the poet, she said, was
largely on the right track. She admitted that she'd never been a "joiner,"
had never belonged to a political party or had a religious affiliation,
had never voted, and didn't really consider herself "in culture" in the
sense that other panelists had used as a ground for their arguments. Her
final self-characterization seemed to be: she loved poetry, loved writing
about poetry, and knew that her "closed-circuit" method was but one of
many valid and indeed necessary approaches to poetry and its discourse.

Afterward, with Susan Wheeler moderating, a few of these things got
elaborated. Stephen Burt suggested that Marjorie Perloff was calling for
more "negative" criticism, and they went back and forth on that for a
while. There was some discussion of the principle "if you don't have
anything nice to say, don't say anything." Marjorie Perloff clarified that
she had been talking about productive combativeness, not hatchet
criticism. Then there were questions & comments from the audience. Michael
Scharf had said something in his talk about how MFA programs had become
part of the business of helping people get their "selves" onto paper, and
Katy Lederer challenged him on the generalization, saying it's maybe just
an easy thing now to bash on MFA programs. There was some discussion about
whether "contemporary avant-garde poets" went or had gone to MFA programs
or not, with Michael maintaining that very few of them did, and Katy (I
think; help, Katy?) that, well, some of them did. At this point I thought
about the rumor that was always floating around Iowa City, that "many" of
the self-styled avant-gardians of the 70s and early 80s had gone through
the Iowa program and sort of buried their MFA credential afterward. I
won't name names I've heard, since it's no more than rumor. Not that it's
anyone's fault for going to Iowa and being disappointed, but it's
obviously a problem for those who set themselves, or this List, up as
ideally untainted by what "Iowa" (and, while I'm at it, Graham) is made to
stand for.

Someone asked a question about what does poetry criticism or reviewing do
for "the reader." Answers from panelists seemed to suggest that a critic
is just a reader who takes the time or has the courage to make a permanent
record of what she thinks about what she's read. That they're not, in
other words, separate social categories. There was a question about "what
good is (academic) poetry scholarship," to which Marjorie Perloff answered
that in its committment to history, scholarship was perhaps the most
valuable of all forms of writing about poetry (ideally, anyway). Brian Kim
Stefans asked what I thought was an excruciatingly smart
question/paragraph about historicity and poetry criticism, which didn't
get fielded particularly well, and I thought it would have been nice to
have him down there on the panel as well, and then I thought that it would
have been nice to have a so-called young female up-and-coming poetry
critic down there too.

Altogether, I think the "clash of the Titans" some had expected did not
occur. Not only because, as Marjorie Perloff pointed out here a few days
ago, both she and Vendler have been caricatured in their opposition, but
also because maybe because there's some truth to the postmodenist canard
that when you really get people talking, binaries tend to fissure into so
many other binaries that they're not binaries anymore. Afterward, we stood
outside smoking like schoolboys/girls, and I remembered sulking outside my
high school building in suburban Long Island, in an upper-middle-class
metalhead phase of the mid-80s, smoking butts --- got a butt, got a butt?
--- and talking about the just-premiered Monsters of Rock (the
Lollapalooza of metal) at the NJ Meadowlands...

I tried to take some notes about the conference, but I can't read my
handwriting (does the phrase "prathas abaut epistimomolg" mean anything to
anyone?)

Generally, though, I would say that there was a skittishness about delving
deeper into much of what was being alluded to.  For example, much of the
talk centered around the idea of "negative" criticism, which basically means
those reviews of books in which the critic foregrounds his/her displeasure
with a particular text.  This was placed on the tolerance/intolerance axis
that Marjorie set up, her argument being that "tolerance" should not be
fetishized for a critic -- that is, that a critic need not advertise her
ability to appreciate poetry from a diverse range of sources to claim
respectability, that a critic need not make claims to non-partisanship, etc.
-- which, I think, is a generally a good principle.  The question, though,
of "intolerance" and by extension the idea of "negative" criticism, was not
approached with any degree of depth.  The problem with this is because there
was a degree of muddiness about the following (as far as I could tell):

        1) the distinction between criticism of new books, that is
"reviews," which provide opinions to people with little or no knowledge of
the text at hand, versus that criticism of older books, literary periods,
the life-works of a writer and his/her value for the future, and expository
writing that describes more than evaluates, etc.

        2) the distinction between that criticism written by a poet --
which, I think, by nature has to do with how such a book could create
possibilities for future writing (by oneself most importantly, by others
secondary, though the poet-critic usually reverses these values in public)
-- and that written by a professional critic, one who's aims are to, one
suspects, create a consistency among her distinctions and propositions, to
create a sort of critical vocabulary that could be extended to other works
not being discussed, and which would, one presumes, have a wider scope of
views and claims even to knowledge (all of which a "poet-critic" could do,
though we don't necessarily ask this)

        3) the distinction between how criticism could work in one sort of
literary society, and how it would work in the "public," which would be the
readership of, say, the New York Times Book review (being an exponentially
larger number of people than those in the "community" type society)

        4) the distinction between critical writing that is consciously
"dialogic" and ephemeral and sets out to be, in the real-time attempt to
find new values or discredit old or poorly stated ones (that is, writing for
the poetics list was universally considered "preaching to the converted"
even when, as in the example Perloff cited, this preaching was in the form
of an argument [twixt Standard and myself, in this case]; most of Pound's
criticism actually, is of this sort, and was being read by his right-wing
audiences in The New Age, etc.), and that which is didactic and wishes to
present a closed, finished set of values for the evaluation of literature,
deduced from scholarship and "close readings", etc.

I'm sure some will disagree with me that these distinctions were not made,
or need to be made.  However, it was unclear why, for instance, Ezra Pound
and T.S. Eliot (and Williams?) were figured as poet-critics who were very
frank in public about their evaluations of their peers work, and were not
merely writing "positive" criticism about their friends -- it's worth
noticing that most of the "negative" criticism we read of these guys about
their peers is in their posthumous letters, not in their essays.  Pound, for
instance, was very frank in his essays about saying there was lots of
garbage out there, and that it was dangerous to society, but he rarely named
poets, and when he did it wasn't in the form of a "negative" evaluative
essay so much as in a nasty aside, or in the description of tendencies.
What we know of Eliot's feelings for Williams are in his letters (he was
"negative" about Edgar Lee Masters, and quite forthright yet decorous -- a
model! -- but this was very early).  Famously, O'Hara never wrote criticism
of his friends that wasn't laudatory, nor does Ashbery, and yet the health
of the "New York School" among themselves is inarguable.  The role
"professional" critics played in describing either of these groups of people
is also arguable -- one might say they played no role except to provide
further scholarship or insights (Kenner on Pound, Perloff on O'Hara, etc.),
but not to provide "real-time" senses of how this work is good, good for
today, or bad, whether for "society" or the individual who wants to spend
some money buying poetry, etc. -- i.e. "negative criticism."

But the other thing that wasn't clear -- and this is more to the point --
was from what sort of ethical or philosophical or political or religious
platform -- that is, from what series of values, however named -- was one to
write this "intolerant" or negative criticism to which, Perloff suggests,
one would aspire to do, at least on occasion.  Because there were no
allusions to wider spheres of knowledge, or greater truth values beyond
"pleasure" to the critic and possible reader, the discussion centered around
these issues: how a "negative" review would hurt a poet's feelings (Perloff
stated, quite frankly, that she couldn't review a book of Philip Levine's
negatively because he had been so kind to her about her previous negative
review of one of his books; so she just didn't write one); how the limited
amount of space in certain publications affects the possibilities of a
review (which is arguable; some 250-word reviews say more than entire
chapters; and some 3-page essays live much longer than entire books); how
writing -- or rather "preaching" -- for those who are in one's "community"
is rather useless compared to what a critic could be doing to create genuine
popularity for new, difficult texts in what is considered "society" (no
recognition at all of how limited this society is -- is Amiri Baraka in
Newark getting his literary opinions from the Boston Review?; ironic, also,
that Perloff would be so dismissive of interactions among poets of smaller
communities -- she didn't say that what I wrote to Standard was worthless,
but rather that writing to him at all was worthless -- when in fact her
reputation is based on her knowledge of smaller, self-contained communities,
like that of Toronto).  It seems that the sort of psychological violence
that a "negative" criticism could have could be justified by one's idea --
as a provider of "truth," the Promethean idea which most of us, in our
humility, don't hold as our model for anything, poetry or criticism -- would
override concerns for a person's feelings on occasion, and in fact would
ennoble the task of criticism rather than make it appear a mere slug-fest.
Were it to be ennobled, that poet being criticized would not be hurt by the
criticism -- good luck! -- which is, of course, where this world of
pluralism (where one can't even anticipate how a review would be received by
he poet) has left us -- which I think is a good thing, now's our task to
figure out how to make this work in a lively fashion.
Colorful detail:

I felt Helen Vendler was the most "avant-garde" of the critics in her rather
bold statement concerning the fact that she never voted, never engages in
society, etc. etc.; that her relationship to the poem was purely circular; I
was reminded Roussel's legendary voyage(s?) to Africa in which he never left
his room on the ship, or even of Dickinson.  No one decided to take her up
on this statement, when it seemed, to me, that the axis that thinking that
would really divide a Vendler and a Perloff/Scharf and to some extent Burt,
on the idea of which critics were contrasting the poems being reviewed to a
sort of "ideal" state of poetry, with eternal values that exist regardless
of society and contingency (Great Chain of Being, Platonic idealism,
relationship to divinity, social coherence -- whatever the system), and
which are looking at the poems as they exist in their own time and place
(the "gestural", as Michael Scharf put it, the pragmatists approach), which
assumes the possibility of not knowing everything about the poem because it
came from, say, the Caribbean.  Burt's statement, which had ambitions to
making great claims, and had a slew of references from Alan Turing to Samuel
Johnson and named a thousand contemporary poets [but quoted the old ones],
in the end was very confused because he was unclear about this issue, and so
his attempts to construct an image of the historical moment was, to me, a
muddle -- this being a time of "epistemological" poetry (I think he meant
"ontological" half the time, and his example was Michael Palmer) whereas the
Modernists were concerned with myths and anthropology (as if anthropologists
like Levi-Strauss and Bourdieu aren't leading figures in poetry discourse,
and as if anthropology and social discourse aren't informing each other more
and more, and as if Henry James, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Gertrude
Stein, Wallace Stevens, a slew of Europeans [Rilke, Pessoa to a degree,
Rimbaud, the aforementioned Roussel, the Cubist painters, etc.] weren't
concerned with issues of epistemology (or ontology).  It strikes me that
critics would be better off not trying to "name their age," or at least play
it safe and name it when the dust has settled -- the "Pound Era" has at
least a nice ring to it; the "new ellipticists" (or whatever) sounds like
what a praying mantis must look like walking with a sprained ankle ("an
insect is an idea made of joints, as Dr. Williams used to say) -- to think
the term is being used in a classroom is unsettling, but better there than,
say, the "public."

Anyway, I think this sacrifice -- at least for the goal of making a pleasant
evening out of it, noble in itself -- of the possibility of a larger sphere
of values determining one's aesthetic judgments beyond taste is why the
discussion centered around the rather mundane -- uninteresting and/or
superficially considered -- world of literary politics, how those in power
presently use it or are able to use it, and why no answer to the question of
why criticism should exist at all, or how wisely to use this power, could be
answered -- anecdote and "taste" took their places.  And so a critic is to
be appreciated because we more or less find his or her taste similar to
ours.  Why read a critic one doesn't like if they are not, in fact,
presenting you with possible new values (especially if they are covering
poets you are sure you don't like)?  And it's pretty obvious that ideology
and the discourse of science has fallen entirely to the wayside, since Marx
(at least as responsible for the criticism of the "self" as Freud and, in a
way, Darwin, and certainly the most vicious in the tearing up of bourgeois,
private space) was not mentioned, which is fine -- new languages are always
needed.  But no one else was mentioned either -- though Turing would have
been a good start!

Anyway, rant and rave...

For some reason, I haven't received the Marjorie Perloff post everyone
is responding to, and so have only seen scattered quotations.  But let
me just say it's completely mortifying to me that my matter/antimatter
quip seems to have been implicated--however circuitously--in charges of

This seems to me mainly an example of how almost any post can mutate
rapidly and dangerously beyond anything one might have foreseen or

Ahh, thanks for that clarification. Now you see how little I know about
Argento's films overall -- I didn't recognize the titles Kevin listed as
Argento's, being only familiar with _Suspiria_.

Regarding violence against women in horror films generally: you might want
to check out Carol J. Clover's _Men, Women and Chainsaws: Gender in the
Modern Horror Film_. Also, I think its good to note that lately there has
been a general turn in the genre away from (directly) linking sexual
activity with being a victim (the _Scream_ series, _The Blair Witch
Project_, and even the most recent _Halloween_ installment (H20)), though I
have to wonder if this shift denotes a new level of consciousness among
filmmakers in the genre, or if its simply a calculated attempt to
reconfigure the formula so that the predictability factor is lessened (in
the 70s & 80s i think it was clear that horror film sex = death, and so once
two characters started fooling around their fate was obviously sealed --
where's the scare in that?). The kids tire of a one-trick pony? Well, only
after some 20 years of the same trick, it seems.

Aside: several years back I was in SF visiting my friend Johnny Huston, who
writes for the SF Bay Guardian (though at this time he might have been at
the Weekly), and we went to see a revival of the horror film _Eyes Without a
Face_ (insert strains of Billy Idol), which he had to write a review of at
the time. Have any of you seen this? French, mid- to late-fifties I believe,
though I must again plead ignorance w/r/t the director. Amazing --
particularly for its time -- and somewhat aligned with _Suspiria_ in
atmosphere and artfulness. Highly recommended.

Tracey, who will get back to the poetry of poetics at some point or other.

This distinction might be of more archeological interest now, and I don't
wish to belabour the point.  My point was that calling New Criticism
formalist was a purely negative characterization. That is, it is formalist
to the extent that it rejects other, non-formalist approaches, but not
formalist in any positive sense (attending to form itself). So formalism
becomes a kind of empty word; hence my principle is that this use of the
word is somewhat "lazy" (no hostility intended of course!). So I still
don't understand Ramez's idea that formalism subsumes New Criticism. It is
maybe a distant cousin, like the stylistics of Leo Spitzer and Damaso
Alonso.

If the New Critics had been formalists, they would have been more
interested and responsive to Zukovsky, Oppen, Williams, Creeley, etc...

Lisa Lubasch!

Congratulations to Lisa, to Avec Press, and to judge John Yau for picking
this excellent first book for the 2000 Norma Farber First Book Award. I
will post Yau's citation as soon as we receive it at the old Society.

Brenda Shaugnessy's Interior with Sudden Joy (FSG) was the runner-up.

Mime-Version: 1.0

Brian Kim Stefans writes:
Famously, O'Hara never wrote criticism of his friends that wasn't laudatory,
nor does Ashbery, and yet the health of the "New York School" among
themselves is inarguable.  The role "professional" critics played in
describing either of these groups of people
is also arguable -- one might say they played no role except to provide
further scholarship or insights (Kenner on Pound, Perloff on O'Hara, etc.),
but not to provide "real-time" senses of how this work is good, good for
today, or bad, whether for "society" or the individual who wants to spend
some money buying poetry, etc. -- i.e. "negative criticism."

------

But I'm not so certain. I think that you can point to Bloom's advocacy for a
particular Ashbery certainly altered (transformed?) the public response his
work got in the 1970s, which in turn led to a series of books (beginning
with Convex Mirror) that are by far the works of least lasting interest.
Also the critical neglect of Berrigan, Ceravolo, Padgett, virtually all of
the 2nd, 3rd & 4th gen. of the NY School has had consequences I would
suspect for each and all. That doesn't mean that they did not push on anyway
and do excellent work. But imagine what Ted Berrigan might be doing still if
only he'd ever gotten a tenure track teaching job with health benefits.


Brian's evil twin,

>Sounds like Jamie Crawford's website, when it's done, will be a good place
to start
>poetry-wise, but I'd love to hear from anyone about poetry, mags, books,
>music, food, galleries, neighborhoods,

Poetry: there's a hundred poets in Boston, most of whom don't know each
other but may have heard each other's names. I can introduce you to some
people I know once we meet but I will also be counting on you to introduce
me to my own neighbors after you've had a chance to settle.

Books: you're welcome to my new book when we meet up.

Music: I don't get out much but there's good scenes in Allston and Cambridge
(venues rather, I don't know the "scenes").

Mags: The first issue of Pressed Wafer is just out. Edited by Bill Corbett,
Joe
Torra, and myself. We also did two chapbooks--Beth Anderson's and Fred
Moten's.
Watch for info concerning release parties in both Boston and NYC in April.
Mike
Magee's excellent Combo is in Pawtucket, RI (but really, I suspect, in
Philly still) and the Rhode Island border is a short distance away. Jacques
Debrot has
a new magazine I think but I haven't seen it yet; he's in southeastern Mass.
but in the poetry world we still call it Boston. There's lots of others
too. I should be checking out Jamie Crawford's website too instead of
yammering so much.

Food: there are more Indian restaurants in Central Square, Cambridge, than
anywhere else in New England-- 26 I think. This may not be accurate but it's
reason enough not to stay home on a Thursday night.

Readings: not on your list but I know there's a reading series evolving
into a monthly--Aaron Kiely's in Porter Square, Cambridge. Average audience
over the past few months has been about 20 people; not bad. Check out
Anselm Berrigan and Sean Cole this Saturday. MIT brings superb poets 2 or 3
times in the spring
and fall. This season: Fanny Howe and Clark Cooldige.

Galleries and neighborhoods: some are not to be missed; others overrated and
overpriced.

Ron Silliman,

I mostly agree w/ your post, but I do take issue w/ your characterization of
Ashbery's post-Mirror poetry.  I think, for example, that the 90s books badly
date McGann's mid-80s assessment of Ashbery's work as increasingly
conformist.  & in the *immediate* aftermath of Mirror (more or less) there
is, of course, As We Know--a really remarkable poem.

You're right, though, to point to the black hole the 2nd, 3rd, and so on NYS
gens. fell into-- mostly as a result of their estrangement from, and
antagonism to critical discourse.  Ultimately, poets have to write their own
literary criticism--for the reasons that Brian gives--but also in order to
*create* definitions of poetic value.

Btw, speaking of the recent confab, a copy of Michael Sharf's chapbook
TELEMACHIAD came in the mail the other day--it's wonderful!  Thanks Mike (?).

Friday, March 24, 7:30 p.m.

Eileen Myles
Elizabeth Treadwell

We work hard to bring you legend after legend, week after week.  The poet
Eileen Myles, based in New York and Provincetown, has read and performed
her work all over the world but nobody loves her more than audiences in San
Francisco.  She's a great raconteur and a brilliant stylist; she slips in
and out of personae the way her writing blurs the boundaries between
artifice and "real life," stardom and poverty, romance and repulsion, prose
and poetry, hurling invective like Catullus, crooning lullabies like
Catullus.  She is a creature of the night sky like the moon over Avenue A.
Eileen Myles contributes articles and reviews to Art in America, The
Nation, Nest, Civilization & The Stranger.  Her books include School of
Fish, Maxfield Parrish, Not Me and Chelsea Girls (stories). She's lately
finished a novel Cool for You.

Elizabeth Treadwell is the author of a novel, Eleanor Ramsey: the Queen of
Cups as well as the following books of prose and poetry, Populace, Stolen
Images of Dymphna, Eve Doe: Prior to Landscape (Movements 9-31), The
Erratix & Other Stories, and Eve Doe (becoming an epic poem). What we like
about Treadwell is her diversity of form, her insistent investigation into
character, family history, landscape, the local.  Her writing attempts
simultaneously to recreate the particulars of a gendered life and to spark
something new, a Bronte refulgent in the California sun. Born in Oakland in
1967, she currently lives in Berkeley, where she edits Outlet magazine and
Double Lucy Books (http://users.lanminds.com/dblelucy).

Subject: DEVELOPING ONLINE COMMUNITIES: A BOL CHAT MEETING

BEHAVIOR ONLINE (http://www.behavior.net) would like to invite you to
attend a panel discussion entitled:

"DEVELOPING ONLINE COMMUNITIES"
Saturday, March 25, 4:00-5:00 pm Eastern US time (Universal/Greenwich Time: 21)
Behavior Online (chat login)
http://www.behavior.net/chat

In this meeting a panel of internet experts will discuss a series of
questions about developing online communities that will be posed to
them by a moderator. After the panel discussion, the meeting will be
opened up to questions and comments from the audience. Some of the
issues to be explored will include:

- Why create an online community?
- The do's and dont's of developing one
- Establishing the ideology and purpose of the community
- Structuring the population and communication infrastructure
- Dealing with the struggles and recognizing the triumphs
- Understanding the life cycle of the community

The program for the meeting is located at
http://www.rider.edu/users/suler/psycyber/bolchatcom.html

The panel discussion will begin at 4:00pm (Eastern US time). You are
welcome to come early - and stay after the hour - to talk with
colleagues. During the panel discussion, please refrain from sending
public messages. You are welcome to "whisper" (send private messages)
to other attenders, but keep in mind that if you whisper to someone,
the chat program places a series of dots next to your name. You will
not see the dots, but other users will. After the panel discussion,
when the meeting is opened up to questions and comments from the
audience, indicate that you want to speak by typing the message
"hand." Questions will be taken in the order of hands raised. "(p)"
will appear after the name of the panelists. Please do not send
private messages to them during the panel discussion.

We strongly recommend that you visit Behavior Online ahead of time
and test out the chat software (http://www.behavior.net/chat). For
this meeting, we will be using the chat software "FreeChat." Read the
help page. It's easy to understand. There are some disadvantages to
FreeChat as compared to other chat programs, but it requires no
downloads, is easy to use, and is stable across many platforms.
During the meeting, if you wish to see new messages as quickly as
possible, set refresh to 5 and click on the refresh button often. If
this frequent refresh is hard on your eyes, set refresh to a longer
period (20, 40) and use the refresh button sparingly. Note that new
messages since the last refresh appear in a different color at the
top of the screen.

<< This distinction might be of more archeological interest now, and I don't
 wish to belabour the point.  My point was that calling New Criticism
 formalist was a purely negative characterization. That is, it is formalist
 to the extent that it rejects other, non-formalist approaches, but not
 formalist in any positive sense (attending to form itself). So formalism
 becomes a kind of empty word; hence my principle is that this use of the
 word is somewhat "lazy" (no hostility intended of course!). So I still
 don't understand Ramez's idea that formalism subsumes New Criticism. It is
 maybe a distant cousin, like the stylistics of Leo Spitzer and Damaso
 Alonso.

 If the New Critics had been formalists, they would have been more
 interested and responsive to Zukovsky, Oppen, Williams, Creeley, etc...

Much thanks for your response. I agree with you that the New Critics became
negatively labeled as "formalists" not because they were particularly
attentive to form, but because they were not more historical/contextual etc.
i.e. I like your "principle." I don't know why the New Critics ignored
Zukofsky, Oppen, etc. Was it because they were not true "formalists," as you
suggest? Because their politics were so antithetical? Circumstance? Were
they simply too much under the spell of the Eliot lineage? I'd like
illumination on this. The reason I'm posting so much (I've lurked for about a
year and a half or something) is that as an undergrad I had it hammered into
me that the New Critics were "formalists," hence I am so provoked. I would
agree with you now that the New Critics, as "formalists," where "formalism"
means attentiveness to form, are distant cousins to formalism. ( By the way,
with Vendler, where this all started, you may find her book on Billy the Bard
more "formalist" in your sense, then her previous work.)

However, I do insist that "formalism subsumes New Criticism" under a
different definition of the word "formalist," which I do not think is a lazy
perjorative monicker. "Formalist," as I said in a previous letter, has come
to mean intrinsic criticism. The only treatment of this semantic aporia I can
recall reading is in Thierry de Duve's _Kant after Duchamp_. de Duve, in
speaking of Clement Greenberg, (arch-"formalist") , quotes C.G. as writing.
"Anything...that does not belong to [the artwork's] 'content' has to belong
to its 'form'....' The unspecifiability of its 'content' is what constitutes
art as art." C.G. is speaking of modern art and making a value judgement that
centers aesthetic value on form, and the generic. For C.G., art is itself the
subject-matter of art. de Duve can thus write, "As a methodology of art
criticism, formalism means that form and subject matter are the only things
one can talk about... formalism cannot speak of content, it can speak of
subject matter," in modern criticism, we have "individual forms whose generic
art-content is appraised as if it were a function of their subject matter."
For C.G., the subject matter is art itself, but the tendency has
metastasized, so that the term "formalism" now encompasses all criticism
which addresses the dialectic between content and whatever the subject matter
of the given form of a work may be. Hope this clarifies my position.

Absolutely. And this is also a clue that the New Formalists are not
formalist at all. If they were, they wd groove on not only those Jonathan
names, but Barret Watten and Ron Silliman into the bargain. 'New Formalist'
is surely a misnomer for 'old rime-shcemes.'

The first performance of sections of "The Doctrine of Similarity" will be on
March 28, 8pm, at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, featuring the Arnold
Schoenberg Choir, with Maurizio Pollini.

=93The Doctrine of Similarity=94 is a section from Shadowtime, an opera by=
 Brian
Ferneyhough for which I wrote the libretto. Shadowtime was commissioned by=
 the
Munich Biennale and will have its premiere in 2002. =93The Doctrine of
Similarity=94 is the first section of the opera to be performed.

Here are some excerpts from the Program Notes:

Shadowtime is based on the life and work of Walter Benjamin (1892-1940). In=
 its
eight sections, the opera explores some of the major themes of Benjaman=92s=
 work,
including the nature of language, the possibilities for a tranformational
leftist politics, and the role of materiality in art.=20

=93The Doctrine of Similarity=94 consists of eight short movements for a=
 48-voice
chorus and six instruments. Each of the movements reflects on the nature of
history, time, and translation/transformation -- all central preoccupations=
 for
Benjamin. The title comes from an essay by Benjamin in which he considers=
 the
ways that the physical sounds of language echo or mimic the primordial
structures of the cosmos. In the work, various numeric patterns create
reverberations within and between the text and music.=20

In terms of musical structure, the theme of temporality is explored by the=
 use
of canon forms throughout the work. In the section called "Indissolubility,=
=94
the concern with the temporal is represented by the choice of a multiple,
palimpsestic parody of a late  medieval motet from the Montpelier Codex. The
libretto extends these investigations through the use of linguistic
translations and displacements. While the text may roam in time, space, and
content, it returns ever and again to the knotted dead end situations of=
 life
in extremity where =93Sometimes / you burn a book because / It is cold / and=
 you
need the fire / to keep warm / and / sometimes / you read a / book for the=
 same
reason.=94

The libretto for "The Doctrine of Similarity" is forthcoming in West Coast=
 Line.
The score has just been publshed by Edition Peters (No. 7564).=20

Yes, those so-called"New Formalists are unknown in Canada. When I
first heard the term I did indeed expect some people interested in
matters of form, not realizing that they were just unthinking
cooky-cutters. When I was 22 and studying linguistics and applying
that study to my reading of Robert Duncan, I thought of myself as a
formalist.

 >the ineffability of childbirth and the paucity of its

these would go hand in hand.


dont mean that to sound snide.


the apparently ineffable may yield some words.  isnt it to that
(im)possibility we poets are drawn? but i shd imagine any commentary on
childbirth that used the word 'birth' would rule itself out.  it wd be like
'i saw the secret of the universe on acid.' or 'how do i love thee, let me
count the ways.'

Hi,

I'm listing url's in my Poetry Links Library for low-residency MFA's (and PhD's if such programs exist) in Creative Writing-Poetry and Poetics.  So far, I know of just  a few:  Goddard, Bennington, Norwich (all in Vermont), Antioch (LA), and Naropa (in the process of setting up the program).  In addition, there is Goucher with an MFA in nonfiction writing.

Any other suggestions, feedback on this?

I'll appreciate any info!  I've not found any place on the web that has a comprehensive list for this field.  I think it could be useful.

Also, has anyone seen or heard from Elliza McGrand lately?  Neither of my email addresses for her or Jordanne Holyoak (editors of Free Cuisenart) have brought a response.

Thanks!
Layne

I think Jacques gets what I would have said.  In general, I would doubt that
health insurance would have prolonged Ted Berrigan's output, or altered the
quality of what he did put out -- or maybe it would have done both, he would
have lived longer and written less.  Who can say? I just don't think there's
a mechanism there.  I tend to think TB and Alice Notley lived according
pretty specific ideas on how much they would want to assimilate into US
culture in order to reap the benefits of a corporate lifestyle; there seems
to be some issue there about being liberated from these structures while
suffering whatever blows that entails.  After all, he was the one who
rejected a Master's degree though he had completed the thesis, and he did
teach a fair amount.  Which isn't to say attention wouldn't have been nice,
just not sure how that would have worked for them (as it possible after the
big public reception of the New Americans?).  As for Ashbery being picked up
by Bloom, I tend to think Ashbery, regardless of critical acclaim, would
have taken the turns he did -- it's worth noticing that he was a very
successful art editor and writer, and probably, without the awards, would
have trucked along in that circuit pretty happily, which is to say he was
never really a social radical, always kind of a nice fellow who got along
with people and had three meals a day -- I think that same temperament went
into the Tennis Court Oath and Hotel Lautreamont ("you mop your forehead
with a rose, recommending its thorns").  I doubt he was much of a firebrand
back then, though we like to think so with that book.

Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado.

*********

From "Southwest":

        C walks G to the bus.  Look, the car wheels,--they repeat it as though
by recognizing the same thing they're finally communicating.  Boots don't
leave prints in the dust unless a little water has recently been present.  The
air is afraid to add friction to anything.  The danger of water is on hunger
not thirst.  There is a layer of forgetfulness on the plaza, drowsy sunburnt
hues, while the so-called Martyrs overlook their crimes from monuments on the
highest ground.  There's no natural shade in this town, few clouds, the light
leaves little to wonder about.  Light is the liquid drowning us, in which we
calculate impossible sequences.  The body is the blueprint of all technology:
our eyes, cameras; our proteins slosh around as multitudinous mega-computers.
We wrote endless theories about "probability," now behind us.  The plane over
Los Alamos at night flies in a grid and, noiseless, can only be seen if you
know what you're looking for.  The passengers have been cut through the
crumpled doors.  Heavy car wheels roll on the sky without tread or traction.
Some accidents choose us.  What if we reached out and tampered with them?  I
guess we'll never know what could've happened, G says, throwing her suitcase
in the belly of the bus.  From her seat she watches C approach the car.  He's
going to interfere, she thinks, amazed.  And arching his fingers back he opens
his palm and presses the tire in the canyon between finger and thumb.

Yes, the ineffable does mean "the impossibility of being expressed in
words," hence, probably Robert Kroetsch's greart essay "Effing the
ineffable."

But David, at least you will remember that despite the odds, there
was a time in the seventies when every writer who had a first child
wrote a book about having that child--Gladys Hindmarch, Margaret
Atwood, Daphne Marlatt, etc.

One more time, the details for this tribute:

Saturday night, March 25

Richard Hugo House, Seattle

A dozen or so readers -- of both Ed's work and/or their own in response to
it -- will include Tom Raworth, Charles Potts, Belle Randall, Judith Roche,
Paul Nelson and other local and national poets. We're asking a donation of
$3 at the door to defray some of these folks' travel costs.

Those of you who WANT to participate in this reading but can't do have a
fall-back option. You can send a few lines of verse that will be
incorporated into a slide show -- a "silent open mike" -- that will precede
the reading itself. Here are the instructions, from "DJ Yum Yum" . . .

"Send yr text to subslideshow@hotmail.com -- no formatting of the text is
necessary.  You can just send it in a regular e-mail message. In order for
the text to fit (and to be reasonably read) on a slide it should be less
than 18 lines long. Please include *Slides for Dorn* in the subject line."

The slides will be accompanied, for about 20 minutes or so, by an evolving
sound mix (including, but not limited to, some really atrocious country
music).

Hope to see you there, live or by proxy!

I didn't catch this original post, but I'm surprised at the characterization
of 2nd/3rd generation New York School writers as estranged from and
antagonistic to critical discourse--

It seems to me that a lot of the writing in the Poetry Project Newsletter,
as well as the critical essays presented every year at the Poetry Project
symposium are a source of valuable critical discourse for the New York/New
York School community,

and there are many other examples--

Bernadette Mayer's writings and projects on psychology, poetics,
experiments, science writing, etc.

Ron Padgett's writings for Teachers & Writers --  much critical discourse
there on poetry and pedagogy,

Ed Sanders' works in Investigative Poetry (I'll consider him a second
generation New York School writer).

and so on--  Alice's Notley's "Homer's Art" (Curriculum of the Soul),
current critical works by younger New York writers like Kristin Prevallet
(work on Helen Adam), Alan Gilbert (a recent essay on the poetics of Anselm
Berrigan, Prageeta Sharma, Greg Fuchs, and Maggie Zurawski), and Daniel Kane
(forthcoming critical book on 2nd generation New York School culture and
performance scene origins), Eleni Sikelianos's work in translation and so
on.


best,
Lisa Jarnot

Punk Rockwell, A Novel by Michael Rothenberg
Tropical Press
PO Box 161174
Miami, FL 33116-1174
14.95 plus 2.50 shipping and handling

ABOUT PUNK ROCKWELL:

Spy-for-hire Punk Rockwell is a charismatic intellectual, a sexual survivor,
a mimic, a clown -- and a renegade man of action. His mission: tracking down
a mysterious precious cache of "caviar", a synthetic ecological cure-all
that represents Russia's last chance to rescue its land, its people, and its
economy in the decaying free-fall of a post-Cold War world. Rockwell's quest
leads him on a perilous whirlwind chase through Mexico, Latin America,
Russia, along the California coast, and deep into the Florida Everglades.

Narrated by poet/eco-warrior Jeffrey Dagovich, the book uses poetic vision,
psycho-narration and memory jags to explore the dark, complex relationships
among Dagovich, his artist wife Emily, Punk Rockwell, and Angelina -- an
eternal beauty who once saved Fidel Castro's life. An adventure tale by an
adventurous writer, PUNK ROCKWELL is strange, sexy and innovative.

Neither message is surefire; they brim rivalry's cant.  This is not to say
that we abolish poetry, nor that the self is invented by the alphabet, but
rather, so fucking early, that vexed double sense: "to be sung, and words
spoken."

        Various forms of the Riler
        eloped.  Technology
        any more than cars.
        Oh, the militant police of emergence.

(from Busted)

...


We think of our poetic influences as tools and vocabularies as well as
constellations and contingent networks.  Shedding the baggage of the past's
traditions, we sustain useful methods and techniques to guide our
future-oriented, conditional, sometimes counter-factual, and maybe even
counter-intuitive practices.  Who needs tradition's alibi?

(from "The Idea File of Contingency")

Anomalous Parlance brings together readings and discussions of book-length
works in progress by six lawless Vancouver-based post-language writers.
Curated by Aaron Vidaver.

Upcoming participants in the series include Lisa Robertson (April 29 & 30),
Susan Clark (May 28) and Christine Stewart (June 25).  A series catalogue
including selections from Pen Chants, Busted, The Weather, Tied to a Post,
and Taxonomy is available for $6.

Can anyone recommend some readings appropriate for a wedding?

it seems increasingly difficult to find something well-written and
unhackneyed about love and/or relationships.  I could use some help with
this.

backchannel reply is good.

(apologies for xposting)

when do you say, i am done with experiment, now i will talk with you,
now you will hear me talking, with no transformation,
and then you might hear me, you might hear me saying,
i'm tired of making meaning, i'm tired of meaning and making meaning,
tired of all of this, of carrying the necessity of language,
the needs of the speaking of language ; there are no angels,
there never have been, there are no others, but of the proffering,
i am sure as long as it's unthought, the way the sun follows form,
think of a sundial ; there are no others gracious in reception,
what i have done, you might find me saying, i'm tired of phorias,
of meaning carried before the back, reachless, gracious, silent,
as long as there are words

At the Poetry Project Next Week:

Monday, March 27 at 8:30 pm

Brenda Shaughnessy & David Baratier

You read right. The reading is at 8:30 pm due to that Mikhail Barishnikov
is dancing next door until then. And no sneaking thru any side doors
either.

Brenda Shaughnessy is the author of Interior with Sudden Joy (Farrar,
Straus, Giroux) which was a runner-up for the Norma Farber Award. David
Baratier's prose novel, In It What's In It, is forthcoming this year from
Spuytin Duyvil.

Wednesday, March 29 at 8 pm

Anselm Hollo & Robert Kelly

Anselm Hollo's latest books include Caws & Causeries and Corvus. He
presently teaches at the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at
Naropa University. Robert Kelly is the author of over 50 books of prose
and poetry, including Runes and the Garden of Distances.

And, making this reading/evening, even more alluring is a post-reading
reception, sponsored by the Consulate General of Finland.

P.S. We could definitely  use volunteer help for clean-up after the
reception! Free admission! Everlasting gratitude! Call us at (212)
674-0910.

Friday, March 31 at 10:30 pm

Will Work for Peace

Contributors from the anthology, Will Work for Peace, read, including Bob
Holman, Ellen Bass, Bill Zavatsky, Daniella Gioseffi, editor Brett Axel,
and musical guests Colleen Kattau and Jolie Christine Rickman. A portion
of the proceeds from this evening will benefit SOA Watch.

The new April/May newsletter is now out and available at readings. Pick
one up and enjoy Lorenzo Thomas (interview with), Lyn Hejinian (essay
on), Prageeta Sharma, Edwin Torres, Kimberly Lyons (reviews of), Tim
Dlugos (poetry by), and more!

Admission to all events, unless otherwise noted, is $7, $4 for students
and seniors, and $3 for members of the Poetry Project. No advance
tickets. The Poetry Project is wheelchair-accessible with assistance and

****

Constantly I write this happily

Hazards that hope may break open my lips

What I feel is taking place, a large context, long yielding, and

     to doubt it would be a crime against it

I sense that in stating "this is happening"

Waiting for us?

It has existence in fact without that

We came when it arrived

Just out from Lawrence Hilll Publishers is THE FICTION OF LEROI JONES /
AMIRI BARAKA --

this volume reprints the early Grove Press books TALES and THE SYSTEM OF
DANTE'S HELL, which have been unavailable for some years -- It also
collects for the first time a few even earlier very short stories,
including "Suppose Sorrow Was A Time Machine," from YUGEN --

MOST IMPORTANT, though, this book publishes for the first time Baraka's
second novel, SIX PERSONS, which had been rejected by Putnams, who had
given Baraka a contract for the book but were somewhat dismayed when the
ms. turned out not to be a black version of THE GODFATHER as they'd hoped!
One chapter of the book appeared in the Baraka COLLECTED PLAYS & PROSE of
the late 70s, but the whole novel has never been available before --

(NOTcoffeeHouse) Poetry and Performance Series
3 pm Sunday, May 21
THE PICKLE JAR
"The Pickle Jar" is a performance troupe made up of five students in the
New York University graduate Creative Writing Program. In addition to their
work as writers and teachers, The Pickle Jar develops performances based on
the poems of the Late, Great Ones. This afternoon's slam, the first of many
they have developed, imagines a party of poets from across time taking
place at Emily Dickinson's house in Amherst, MA.
Each of the poets--Sappho, Sylvia Plath, Emily Dickinson, Ted Hughes, and
Rumi--speaks only in poems, lines, and fragments of their own poetry. This
slam won the Dead Poet's Slam contest at the Poetry Olympics at the
Brooklyn Brewery this past November.
Individual Biographies:
Corie Herman is a performance poet from the New York City area; she
considers Sappho one of the most important "figures" in feminism as well as
poetry. That is why she has manifested her as a drinking, smoking,
leather-vinyl wearing sexy mamma.
Amelia Wentworth built her own house out of slanted wood and called it
truth. She listens to the gospel of the crickets every night.
Jason Schniederman is one of the most sought after porn stars in the
business. The son of migrant workers, he is a pathological liar.
Jaymie ScottodiSantolo's Sylva Plath is electric, riveting and simply sex.
Come see her hair grow licks of fire, her mouth erupt in poetry, herhand
clench over Ted Hughes' balls...
Kazim Ali is an activist, painter, and tantric totem. He imagines Rumi as
his (bare-chested, glitter-smeared, belly-dancing, smoldering) ancestor. In
previous lives he's been Eros, Garbo, and Ephraim of "The Changing Light of
Sandover" fame.
May 21 - 3 pm - THE PICKLE JAR plus Much More poetry and music TBA

The End.

       Deep South Festival of Writers 2000

     The Deep South Festival of Writers, one of the oldest
and most prestigious writers conferences in the United
States, announces its 40th annual fall festival, October
12-15, 2000 at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette. 2000
marks the fourth decade of the Deep South Festival of
Writers, as well as the centennial anniversary of the
University of Louisiana at Lafayette. To commemorate the
coincidence of these special events, this fall the Festival
will showcase Louisiana writers, artists, and the Louisiana
setting in literature and the creative imagination. We
encourage all patrons of the arts, painters, musicians,
book-lovers, bar-napkin poets, and anyone else with an
impulse towards artistic expression, to join us in the
four-day celebration.

     Each year, the Deep South Festival affirms the value of
literary arts and creative endeavors in Acadiana by
featuring public performances, panel discussions, craft
lectures, and exhibitions from a host of artists across the
nation. By providing local artists and the community at
large with nationally and world-renowned artists, the
festival commemorates and encourages the urge towards
writing and artistic expression. At the 40th Annual Fall
Festival, Deep South will present writers in readings and
craft lectures in a wide array of genres, from drama to
poetry, from fiction to folklore. In addition to these

This morning, at the 72nd street subway station, I asked the clerk for a
$17-7 day, unlimited card. I put down a twenty. I took what I thought was
three dollars change and the unlimited card. I went and ran the card through
the turnstile and realized the guy had given me a $15, pay-per-ride card, and
five dollars change. I went back to the guy and told him the deal. He would
NOT exchange the $15 card for a $17, unlimited card because he said I had
already used the $15 card. I was standing RIGHT in front of him; it was a
MINUTE later. Obviously, I hadn't raced down the subway and gone blocks away
and BACK in a minute.

I'm thinking of getting a horse.

Subject: Shadowtime


The first performance of sections of "The Doctrine of Similarity" will =
be on
March 28, 8pm, at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, featuring the Arnold
Schoenberg Choir, with Maurizio Pollini.

"The Doctrine of Similarity" is a section from Shadowtime, an opera by =
Brian
Ferneyhough for which I wrote the libretto. Shadowtime was commissioned =
by
the
Munich Biennale and will have its premiere in 2002. "The Doctrine of
Similarity" is the first section of the opera to be performed.

Here are some excerpts from the Program Notes:

Shadowtime is based on the life and work of Walter Benjamin =
(1892-1940). In
its
eight sections, the opera explores some of the major themes of =
Benjaman's
work,
including the nature of language, the possibilities for a =
tranformational
leftist politics, and the role of materiality in art.=20

"The Doctrine of Similarity" consists of eight short movements for a
48-voice
chorus and six instruments. Each of the movements reflects on the =
nature of
history, time, and translation/transformation -- all central =
preoccupations
for
Benjamin. The title comes from an essay by Benjamin in which he =
considers
the
ways that the physical sounds of language echo or mimic the primordial
structures of the cosmos. In the work, various numeric patterns create
reverberations within and between the text and music.=20

In terms of musical structure, the theme of temporality is explored by =
the
use
of canon forms throughout the work. In the section called =
"Indissolubility,"
the concern with the temporal is represented by the choice of a =
multiple,
palimpsestic parody of a late  medieval motet from the Montpelier =
Codex. The
libretto extends these investigations through the use of linguistic
translations and displacements. While the text may roam in time, space, =
and
content, it returns ever and again to the knotted dead end situations =
of
life
in extremity where "Sometimes / you burn a book because / It is cold / =
and
you
need the fire / to keep warm / and / sometimes / you read a / book for =
the
same
reason."

The libretto for "The Doctrine of Similarity" is forthcoming in West =
Coast
Line.
The score has just been publshed by Edition Peters (No. 7564).=20

Lisa,

I take your point & in responding briefly to your post, I also want (again,
as briefly as I can) to touch on Elizabeth Treadwell's recent comments
concerning women & theory.

By criticism I meant something quite narrow;  namely, a discourse whose
horizon is that of the academy.  Other kinds of criticism exist of course,
but they are either
1. essentially aesthetic performances themselves (e.g. the Mayer you
mentioned), or 2.  legitimating discourses *within* a coterie (e.g. the
reviews that appear in places like the Po Project Newsletter).

In her objections to the prevalence, in List discussion, of criticism
oriented toward more academic models, Elizabeth mistakenly--or, at least,
much too easily--*sexes* theory.  Indeed, none of the discourses I've
mentioned seems to me any more or less intrinsically masculinist (which is to
say that they all might be *guilty* to the same degree).  Academic discourse
occurs, of course, within a culture which is much more highly routinized than
the culture of the poetry world.  (For this reason, there will always
inevitably be, for example, a significant time-lag between *living poetry* &
its academic recognition.)  In contrast to the routinized & professional
discourse of the academy, critical discourse of the kind Elizabeth and Lisa
are speaking of, bases its legitimating function almost wholly on a *belief*
in the poet's charismatic authority.

But if the destination to which every painting aspires is the museum
(*willingly or not*, by virtue of its belonging to the category "art"), then
the ultimate trajectory of every poem is the academy.  By far the most
important function of literature departments--whatever else they **claim** to
do-- is to consecrate authors.  (If people so often pair Vendler & Perloff,
part of the reason for this is that they are both so upfront about their
roles as arbiters of competing literary tastes & reputations.)  Sanders,
Berrigan, et. al. still have significant prestige within the coteries in
which their work circulated, but unless the work speaks to the values
privileged by the academy their work will virtually disappear within the
living memory of those who knew them.  Indeed, the unbalanced assessment of
Ashbery's poetry compared to that of the other New Am Poets lies exactly in
the way his work dovetails--much more so than the others-- w/ contemp ideas
about subjectivity, authorial agency, etc (while at the same time remaining
palatable to Vendler, Bloom, & that crowd).   Similarly, the  address of
Language criticism was fully informed by the academic discourse of the 70s &
80s, & as a result, the disparity between their prestige & that of the other
av-gardes w/ whom they were contemporaries is also pretty blatantly
unbalanced.

Academic fashions change of course.  So there is no moral to my narrative.  I
just wanted to begin to suggest what exactly is at stake in this discussion.

I want to very briefly add that, although my previous post lacked a moral, I
did want to leave the impression that the critical discourse of (American)
poets is generally much more doxic & less varied than that of academics (the
New Critics & the Language Poets would be impt exceptions--though eventually,
like every other critical discourse, their work also lead to new
orthodoxies).  Academic critics--since they don't themselves play the
*game*--frequently lack a certain sensitivity to, or savior-faire of the
subtleties of contemporary practice--often they strike people who do write
poetry constantly as being slightly (or, in fact, very much) tone deaf,
no?--they are not as good *connoisseurs* as poets are;  their taste is always
just a little *late*, perhaps (while emerging poets, with an anxiety similar
to that of high school students, are always trying to figure out, it seems,
just who the *new* buzz is about--this is largely the function of the Poetry
Project Newsletter, for example);  but poets tend to lack, more importantly,
the capacity (partly a matter of education, social/institutional positioning,
and so on) for formulating interesting & original *ideas* (as distinct from
interesting *language*).  In fact, it's very often more than an
incapacity--it's a refusal--to take ideas seriously.

Don't know whether there's really any interest here, but FYI--

Palo Alto Weekly Wednesday Mar 22, 2000

Miriam Patchen

Peace activist, wife of poet and novelist Kenneth
Patchen

Miriam Patchen, 86, a longtime Palo Alto resident
and peace activist, died March 6. Born Sirkka
Miriam Oikemus in Belmont, Mass. to Finnish
socialist parents, she was politically active all her
life. She claimed to have been the "youngest
card-carrying member of the American Communist
Party," having joined at the age of 7. In 1934, she
married poet and novelist Kenneth Patchen, who
dedicated more than 40 works of poetry and prose
written between 1936 and 1972 to her. The couple
moved frequently in the 1930s and 1940s, living in
New York and Connecticut, living off of royalties
from Kenneth Patchen's books. Shortly after their
marriage, in 1937, Kenneth Patchen suffered a
disabling spine injury, and was bedridden for the last
20 years of his life. In 1952, on the advice of his
doctors, they settled in California, where he
pioneered the fusion of poetry and jazz, working with
the Chamber Jazz Sextet and Charles Mingus. In 1956
the Patchens moved to Palo Alto. After his death in
1972, she dedicated herself to peace and poetry. She
was active in a group that held demonstrations for
peace every week on the corner of El Camino Real
and Embarcadero Road. She stood on the corner
every Tuesday for 15 years holding a picket sign
protesting American military intervention around the
world. She was also active in promoting her
husband's poetry, frequently holding readings of his
work. In May 1998 she traveled to London, England
to take part in the conference, "Word, Image &
Rhythms: a celebration of Kenneth Patchen." At the
meeting she read his poetry, discussed his visual
work (he created nearly 200 "picture poems") and
shared anecdotes of their life together. Since 1998
she had been assisting Larry Smith on the biography
"Kenneth Patchen: Rebel Poet in America" (Bottom
Dog Press, 2000) to be published this month. In 1998,
she was the subject of the film, "Miriam Is Not
Amused," a short documentary by Kim Roberts. She
also enjoyed travelling and gardening. In 1998 her
house was damaged by flood, but she rebuilt with the
help of friends. She was preceded in death by her
huband, Kenneth Patchen, and by her later partner,
civil rights activist and lawyer Laurent Franz. A
memorial protest vigil was held last Tuesday. A
memorial service and poetry reading memorial are
being planned for May.

    PALO ALTO -- A May memorial service is being planned for Miriam
Patchen of
    Palo Alto, a longtime pacifist demonstrator who died earlier this
month at the age of
    85.

    For 15 years, Mrs. Patchen, the widow of the renowned poet Kenneth
Patchen was a
    familiar rush- hour figure most Tuesday evenings on the corner of El
Camino Real and
    Embarcadero in Palo Alto, where she rallied with other protesters
against U.S.
    military interventions, waving placards that urged passing motorists
to ``honk for
    peace.''

    On occasion, she would be accompanied only by Laurent Frantz, a
civil rights lawyer
    and her longtime companion after her husband's death in 1972. Frantz
died two years
    ago.

    Nearly 50 peace activists gathered on the same corner, in front of
Town & Country
    Village shopping center, to conduct a ``memorial protest vigil'' not
long after Mrs.
    Patchen's death on March 6.

    She had died in her Palo Alto home, apparently while reading a peace
pamphlet,
    according to Jonathan Clark of Mountain View, a friend who had gone
to visit her and
    discovered the body.

    ``I think I'll remember her best for her caustic wit and fierce
devotion to her causes
    and her friends,'' said Clark.

    Her friends were also devoted to her. In 1998, her home on Sierra
Court was
    seriously damaged by flooding, but it was rebuilt through the
efforts of several friends.

    ``A lot of people liked being with her. She was very funny,''
recalled Purusha Obluda
    of Palo Alto, who was part of a small group who dined regularly with
her.

    Paul George, executive director of the Peninsula Peace and Justice
Center in Palo
    Alto, praised her as ``a powerful symbol of commitment for the rest
of us.''

    ``I don't think she ever missed an event, even if it was just
stuffing envelopes,'' he said.

    While maintaining a busy schedule of peace movement activities, Mrs.
Patchen was
    equally well known in the literary world for her efforts to sustain
public and scholarly
    interest in the works of Kenneth Patchen, whom she married at the
age of 17 in 1934.

    According to friends, the FBI briefly pursued the couple from
Massachusetts after the
    two had crossed state lines into Ohio and convinced a justice of the
peace that she
    was of legal age to marry. The search was finally called off by the
young bride's
    parents.

    The couple moved frequently in the 1930s and '40s, subsisting on
royalties from the
    poet's many books, all of which bear the dedication, `'For Miriam.''
The Patchens
    moved to the Bay Area in the 1950s so that Kenneth could be near
specialists treating
    a debilitating spinal injury that eventually left him bedridden in
his later years.

    Mrs. Patchen left no surviving relatives, and at her request there
was no funeral
    service.

    Rita Bottoms, curator of the Patchen Archive at the University of
California at Santa
    Cruz and a longtime friend, said plans are moving ahead for a
memorial service to be
    held in Palo Alto, although it has been delayed until late May.

    ``We're expecting a number of people to come from out of state and
at least a few
    other countries,'' she said.

    Memorial donations may be made to the Kenneth Patchen Archive,
payable to the UC
    Regents at Special Collections, University Library, University of
California at Santa
    Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064.

Rackover Viewfinder

The Mitchell motion picture cameras shown in Sunset Boulevard employ
rackover viewfinders, which displace the film, replacing it with a ground
glass screen - which is racked back for the shooting itself. The same
system is used in the Cine-Kodaks, and a somewhat clumsy attachment was
available for the older non-reflex 16mm Bolex as well. Look through the
viewfinder, frame your subject; reset the film, and shoot. The
displacement is temporal, not spatial; one, then the other, then the one.
Sight is otherwise a disestablishment of position, peering around a
corner; here, the corner flattens, in the guise of time, for the means of
constituted representation. In Sunset Boulevard, Desmond speaks about her
silence; Max is silent about her speech; the noise is filled by the
writer. It is not a displacement of silence by sound or of one
constitution by another, but of spaces by times, times by spaces, air by
water, water by air. At the end the dead writer speaks.

At the end the drowned writer is racked over and it's there after that
time he can start writing.

I'm teaching a course in the fall on poetry written in dialects,
idiolects, and pidgins.

Several questions:

I'm interested in hearing suggestions of works to teach in in this
course

And I want to do one day a week that is a listening/viewing day. I'm
planning on doing some of the classics: the Sterling Brown cd; Linton
Kwesi Johnson; Lois Ann Yamanaka reading Pahala Theatre and some pidgin
stuff I've got on tape; the United States of Poetry videos; some rap;
maybe some blues; etc.

Anyone have any suggestions?

Anything they would care to share?

Or could help me locate?

Our library seems to not have much in this area. And I need to give them
a list soon if I want to have any hope of them ordering stuff.

I sent submissions to Big Allis and they got returned -- does anyone have
their current address?  (I got the address out of the last issue, so I
thought it *was* current!)  And if you know that, say, they are no longer
reading for the season, you could tell me that, too.  I'd be much obliged.
Backchannel, please.

Thanks,

Eons ago, I asked y'all about sources for Michael Ondaatje's 1970 "Sons of
Captain Liberty" film on bp nichols, and at last I seem to have tracked
down the single source.  It's not on video, just 16 mm, and it rents from
The Canadian Filmmaker's Distribution Center in Toronto for $70 per
screening.  Information:  www.cfmdc.org -- or 416-588-0725.

Subject:      to revise or not?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I happened just latley to read on the same day Kerouac's thing about
spontaneous prose and Raymond Carver's intro to John Gardner's Becoming a
Novelist. It's curious. Carver describes revision as almost a religion for
Gardner, and that revision is the real writing. And you know what Kerouac
says. What's odd is that they _start_ with a similar idea, that you start
and then the real work comes in reacting to what you've already done. But
Kerouac wants to stay close to jazz improvisation as a model, so you get
everything, without changing or improving or removing or rewriting of any
kind, only a piling on (hence his allowance of insertion).

So here are two views of revision, starting from at least one common idea,
each held with near religious conviction, that treat revision as
practically a moral issue, but leading to exactly opposite conclusion about
the most basic question-- whether to revise at all. A question Gardner
would've considered ludicrous really, and which Kerouac considered only to
reach a final and definitive answer in the negative.

This is all just a goddawful pedantic way of asking what are we to think
and what do people think about revision and does anyone have any thoughts
on Kerouac and any ideas to share from their own practice.

Subject:      Brian Kim Stefans' post on criticism
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I've made my usual mistake of deleting a post only to find, days later, that
I wish to respond - a minor point perhaps, prompted by Brian Kim Stefan's
interesting (as always)post on criticism.

Simply this - my understanding of the nature of most contemporary
experimental poetry coming out of North America, the U.K, Australia, New
Zealand (I'm the constant qualifier, chary of statement except when... aw,
forget it) is that the role of the reader has been recuperated from the bred
passivity of mainstream lyricism ( one might here indulge in Romantic
metaphors of plucked harps etc.; alternately - pick up on the way in which
poet/reader fall so easily into a sexual dynamic in this model - no prizes
for guessing which is which). The 'poem' is not complete (intact) on the
page, in fact one might question whether it exists at all in any absolute
sense, rather it 'exists' in the process of being read and is thus in a
perpetual state of transformation. Which, of course, is why good readers are
as essential as good writers. Any review/reading posted to the List is
part of the process of poetry. Whether or not it constitutes 'preaching to
the converted' is irrelevant. Of course whether these posts are of equal
value is a separate (and clearly
variable) matter.
To pursue briefly the ' P. to the C.' thread - some of us are still acolytes
and welcome elucidation/ discussion/ commentary both for the window onto
hitherto unknown poets and the teasing out of assorted threads. I can't
speak for anyone else but I'm learning and that's always good. If this
sounds a little ingenuous, it's not that everything posted strikes me as
something I could agree with but points of disagreement can be stimulating.
(I'm suspect of dualities in general but sometimes wonder if one can ever
wholly escape that
sense of the 'other' against which there is definition, perhaps the crucial
mistake is to ever think one is anything but a part -) (In case you haven't
noticed, this is being written late at night.)

Finally, on critics and taste - must a critic be so bound? I'm not arguing
for a spurious objectivity but isn't it possible to read poetry which one
can recognise as 'good' in that it is well crafted  ? (from one evasion to
another, but if I try to define good or craft I may never arrive)(Not to
mention that area beyond craft which can mean the difference between good
and wonderful). Plucking a name from the air - take Seamus Heaney, I don't
much want to read his work, there's that intermittent doubt as to what
century he's living in (a virtue for some readers, I dare say), but can one
argue that it's bad poetry? On the other hand there are some poets who are
philosophically more acceptable, they write a worthy sort of poetry but
strike no sparks - taste seems insufficient to account for these
sorts of responses.
I remember Dodie Bellamy writing about the effect of eliminating the first
person from her reviews (distinct failure of this post in that regard) and
wonder if there might not be some version of 'negative capability' available
to the critic -  a territory beyond personal
taste. One direction one might go in is the so-called materiality of the
word, a constellation of qualities that are not always worked as they might
be - the dullness I referred to above is frequently due to failure to use
sound and rhythm successfully. Hank Lazer (Opposing Poetries) quotes John
Barthes (I only mention the source as I don't want to give the false
impression that I've read Barthes) as saying that the writer should "cruise"
the reader (and yes, that does suggest earlier disparaging remarks about
Romantics, ci-devant or otherwise, but a quite different relationship is
being posited)
and it's precisely these sensory/ physical qualities that constitute an
attractive invitation. I don't discount visual properties or form (spatial
dimensions) but these are less disregarded perhaps, and less involving being
less a part of the immediacy of a poem read aloud which is to how I prefer
to hear poetry, even if it's only an internal aloudness. I mention all this
simply as a point from which one might start to evolve some consistency in
approach to poetry. Limited, of course.
Now, I'm even wondering if is this a useful idea - a standard for reading
poetry might well be as undesirable as a standard for writing it.

confused as ever

Death Meaning


Death is an impossibility. Since it is an impossibility it cannot happen.
Therefore there is no death.

If death could happen, all things would be possible. Since not all things
are possible, death cannot happen.

Death is a word for "this is not possible." It is also a word for "not
everything is possible."

If everything were possible, there would be no need [word] for possibil-
ity. Since there is a need for possibility, not everything is possible,
and there is no death.


There is nothing outside of meaning.
Meaning is all there is.
Meaning is a disease.
Meaning is a disease of humanity.
Meaning's absence is the preservation of the world.
Only in meaning is absence to be found.
Meaning is a disease.
There is nothing outside but ourselves.


If existed, it would be possible to inscribe; if death existed, it would
be impossible to write.

sorry for the paraphrase, if it is distorting/simplifying your meaning,
but aren't we all engaged in mimicking a gender or set of genders?

for the record, I am

DAVID KNOEBEL: VRML, 3D POETRY,  & THE POETRY OF SIGNS

David Knoebel's Defib is up at http://webartery.com/defib/canned/DavidKnoebel

Defib is webartery.com's bi-monthly IRC chat that features Web artists
discussing their work and the surrounding issues. During the week prior to the
chat session (which is logged and produced into a hypertranscript available on
the Web), the members of webartery discuss the feature's work on the webartery
email list in order to attain deeper understanding of the person's work.

The plan had been to use some of the resulting email within the production of
the chat transcript. But the chat session had to be cancelled because the
technology was not functioning at the scheduled time. So, not to be defeated by
the technology, we have used the email about David's work in a different kind of
Defib hypertext which is an amusing and informative introduction to Knoebel's
poetic work in literary/visual/sonic/sculptural hypermedia.

Many thanks to David and all who participated.

EXCERPT:

"My pieces are usually short. I think I'm a genetic minimalist (less is more,
and more is better), but I think this preference also comes from the recognition
that a lot of people don't read very far into a multi-page work. I build my
pieces by putting together a few simple elements. The interest for me is in the
elements' interactions. These are generally not simple and their complexity may
increase geometrically as the number of elements increases arithmetically. When
I start to make larger pieces, I'll build them by putting smaller ones together,
on the model of, say, a coral reef. The reader could start anywhere in the
structure, stay for a short time or a longer time, and come away with a complete
experience in either case...."

"...when we drive down the street, we are surrounded by words that pass us by.
Driving home, we encounter the same signs we saw on the way to work, in reverse
order. Trips around town, to the gas station, the supermarket, or the post
office, reveal additional orderings of the same set of signs. The words become
part of other events in our field of vision. They are no longer bound to a
single continuous surface or to a preordained sequence."
David Knoebel

Jim Andrews

POETRY CENTER 2000
The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

a reading & celebration in honor of Etel Adnan's 75th birthday
ETEL ADNAN &
RABIH ALAMEDDINE
Thursday March 30, 7:30 pm, $5
@ The Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)
San Francisco

[PLEASE NOTE:  Due to health constraints, Etel Adnan is unable to travel to
attend this evening's event.  Simone Fattal will read instead from Ms.
Adnan's work, and we'll listen to British composer Gavin Bryar's "Adnan
Songbook," and also exhibit several of Etel Adnan's hand-calligraphed
books, which have been shown internationally.  The evening will conclude
with Rabih Alameddine reading from his own fiction.]

ETEL ADNAN has been a vital presence--as teacher, visual artist, poet,
prose writer, and thinker--for years in the common consciousness of writers
and artists not just in our backyard but seemingly across half the world.
*  A native of Beirut, Lebanon, and long-time resident of the Bay Area,
she's the author of numerous works of prose and poetry, including the
internationally renowned novel of the Lebanese civil war, SITT MARIE ROSE
and the recent long prose-poem THERE.  *  Gavin Bryars has set her "Love
Songs" to music, recorded on his CD Cadman Requiem as Adnan Songbook, and
she's worked with director Robert Wilson, as well as the great actress
Jeanne Moreau, among others.  *  It's a true pleasure for The Poetry Center
to honor her on this extraordinary anniversaire.  *

RABIH ALAMEDDINE is a novelist and a painter, born and raised in Beirut,
Lebanon, and living in San Francisco.   *  His first novel, KOOLAIDS: The
Art of War, is a truly outstanding literary accomplishment--a beautiful
work of imaginative and piercingly acute intelligence that manages somehow
to be deeply moving, ironic, and excitingly new in its possibilities.  *
Mr. Alameddine's first book of stories, THE PERV, is just out.  *

SIMONE FATTAL is an artist and translator, and the publisher of Post-Apollo
Press.  Born in Damascus, Syria, Ms. Fattal has lived in Beirut, in Paris,
and in the Bay Area.

Dear Friends

Bad news.

I think it hasn't been announced here that Alaric Sumner, known to some of
you in USA, died suddenly at his home in St Ives, Cornwall last Friday.

We're trying to come to terms with that.

His books include:

Rhythm to intending, Spectacular Diseases 1994
Lurid Technology and the Hedonist Calculator, Lobby 1994
Waves on Porthmeor Beach, Wordsworth, 1995
Aberrations of Lenses, mirrors, sight, RWC 1998
Bucking Curtains, Mainstream 2000

(The last, my publication, is temporarily out of print; but it will, I hope,
come back into print shortly. Aberrations, also mine - a few copies remain
an, if there were demand, I'd reprint. Waves, a best-seller, shifting in
hundreds and hundreds, is o.p. except for the limited edition & even that is
problematic at present as the press was Alaric's. I don't know the status of
the others.... There's a will to get some kind of memorial collection out,
but more of that as and when)

His website, which will link you to his online work, is
http://www.dartington.ac.uk/~a.sumner/

Juliana,

Since you seem to be including music, a listen to Fela Kuti's "Original
Suffer Head" might be of interest. There's a brief discussion in Mackey's
Bedouin Hornbook, as well as an extended linguistic analysis of its lyrics,
along with several other tunes, with a view to their use and strategic
intermingling of Nigerian Standard English, Nigerian Pidgin, and Yoruba
lexical and syntactical elements. The article is by Marcus Coester, titled,
"Language as a Product of Cultural Contact," and is available in English at
http://ntama.uni-mainz.de/~ntama/main/language_as_product/

This is part of a special issue of NTAMA - Journal of African Music and
Popular Culture, published (though apparently not since 9/98) out of the
University of Mainz.  Full table of contents at http://ntama.uni-mainz.de/

Found this while looking for an answer to Mackey's question, in the
postscript to the letter in BH in which the discussion of Fela occurs, "Does
anyone know what a Jeffa Head is?" The question references Fela's lyric:

        Dem come turn-us to suffer-head to
        Original Sufferhead
        It's time for Jefa-Head O
        Original Jefa-Head O

It's answered by Coester as follows:

"`Jefa' is a Yoruba word. It means `to enjoy a good fortune`; Yoruba-English
dictionary, p. 133. `Jefa-Head`here is the opposite of `Sufferhead`; both
terms were coined by Fela Kuti."

Alright, that's probably more information than you wanted, but I'm always so
pleased when I actually find the answer to a directed question, rather than
fortuitous accidental discoveries, on the Internet. Just couldn't resist the
impulse to share.

Best,
Taylor

P.S. Another suggestion or two:

Michael Smith, It a Come (alongside Linton Kwesi Johnson - also Brathwaite's
poem dedicated to Smith [whose title escapes me right now - perils of
writing from work])

Slave narratives collected by the Federal Writers' Project, many of them
interesting, necessary reading in their own right, and also as sites of
contestation over who represents speech "in dialect." Not poetry per se, but
the conversion narratives in particular articulate an historically
distinctive and forceful poetics.

Subject:        dialects, idiolects, and pidgins

I'm teaching a course in the fall on poetry written in dialects,
idiolects, and pidgins.

Several questions:

I'm interested in hearing suggestions of works to teach in in this
course

And I want to do one day a week that is a listening/viewing day. I'm
planning on doing some of the classics: the Sterling Brown cd; Linton
Kwesi Johnson; Lois Ann Yamanaka reading Pahala Theatre and some pidgin
stuff I've got on tape; the United States of Poetry videos; some rap;
maybe some blues; etc.

Anyone have any suggestions?

Anything they would care to share?

Or could help me locate?

Our library seems to not have much in this area. And I need to give them
a list soon if I want to have any hope of them ordering stuff.

Well, for a little comic relief & deep backtrack, you might try
James Whitcomb Riley's FARM-RHYMES [10 copyrights
in my copy between 1883 & 1901]--wildly, if inexplicably,
popular. Seems like a hayseed response to Robert Burns...
about as dreadful as much of today's stuff may sound in 100
years.... Hey: who knows? He may actually have spoken
that way, and certainly had heard those who did, more or less.
Gabby Hayes or Walter Brennan on retro verbal steroids.

Never overlook the populist, the little guy: as Harold Carswell
said during his unsuccessful hearings for appointment to the
Supreme Court--when someone alluded to his ostentatiously
undistinguished record as a legal scholar--'mediocre people
need a voice, too' (or words to that effect). Go for the faux.

Dear list,

Does anyone know of any works by Abraham Lincoln Gillespie currently in
print? If not, what has existed in the past and how can I get a hold of
some of it?

Thanks in advance,

Marc

Fit One

Twinge: the first=20

        Do what you will! This is the talk of the Hermit, the Lover, and the
man of Earth. They all come together, sit back and talk of restriction and
eventually come to a conclusion, then stray; as stars in the nights. This is
the talk. The word of sin is restriction. This is what they say. They come
together talk, solve then do nothing with the answers they are given. They
will do no wrong, if you look closely into the word. But how can they do
right? The sin is restriction and that restriction is self imposed. I don't
always agree with them. They do not always agree with each other. That's the
moral; if one needs a moral, here it is set down in a beginning, a beginning
hunted like the snark.=20
        This shall be the Law of the whole. This is a moral utterance. It is
derivative in form and substance from Rabelais, for it was him who placed
this rule of the mouth of the fictional Abbey of Th=E9l=E8me. The classic=
 satire
in Gargantua, by Fran=E7ois Rabelais, the French priest and occultist. Study
Rabelais before discussing the Law. In Rabelais this rule "fay =E7e que
vouldras", literally translated "to do what you will." From his words spoken
through the character of the Abbey, the maxim became known.  This is a part
of my literary life and culture, as a character that is. It is my life. It
is my role. It is the way of the True and Right order Medmenham Friars. So
it shall be.=20
        In the Law. It is authority, set in place by an author, told through
a character, to an author then reintegrated back into the system by a
narrator setting the stage for a character speaking for a real person who is
not that person at all. Do what you will is explained in terms of true will,
the ultimate being, the spiritual core or quintessence of each person, as a
divine self-ordained path through the world of experience, tangible and=
 other.=20
        Do what you will refers not to the outer emotional and intellectual
self but to this sacred inner core of personal divinity. And divinity is
often never divine. Often will is contrasted with whim, and the knowing and
doing of the true objective will is a prisoner printing license plates,
painted not in terms of license but of responsibility and consequence, as
its result. These are apparent.=20
        These are also apparent contradictions. And so the Law takes on a
different meaning, a non-dual meaning. It has to, that is if it is to work,
it must.  How else can one enter into something without some form of
reconciliation. The realization of one's true nature comes at the same time
that one realizes one's unity with all beings. How does one cross the gap,
gap the bridge, bridge a relatively unenlightened form to a state of pure
asymetrix; which is also paradoxically selfless.
        At different levels of initiation there are different criteria of
truth. The truth is one of three; three blind mice. The truth is never a
clear chop from the butcher's wife, now is it? The truth of one is sacred to
that one, and can is false or nonsense to another. Do what you will is the
Law; and the Law is as moral a law as it is amoral. It's the only
restriction, all else becomes sheets riding against the wind. So for the
ordinary person, do what you will is a useful rule of thumb. At higher
levels one realizes that there are no ordinary persons, or that the
distinction between self and non-self is an illusion. There is no self yet
there is self. There are no others, yet my neighbors are closing in. These
are also apparent contradictions. Here it is set down in the beginning, a
beginning hunted like the snark.=20

Subject:      Re: to revise or not?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

There is revision and there's revision. One of my very favorite writers, Rae
Armantrout, does an enormous amount of revision. I do very little. And
revision can be viewed so many different ways: was Ginsberg's ordering of
the typed pages he found on Burroughs' floor into the making of Naked Lunch
a revision in the same sense that Pound revised Eliot? Quien sabe?

I don't think that it's possible, ultimately, to tell a writer what her or
his process ought to be -- it's almost metabolic and not open to transfer
really. It's analogous to the idea that writing can be learned but it can't
be taught.

Rather, I think the greater question is revision to what effect? I find that
I have no interest -- less than zero in fact -- in those authors whose texts
seem to aspire to not having a single hair out of place. It creates an
effect that I find totally claustrophobic. So the writing of Nabokov, Gass,
all the dull minions of Updike just strike me as utterly lifeless (the most
sensual part of Lolita is to be found in the descriptions of western
scenery, for example, the one moment in the text in which you could tell
that the author himself was alive).

Yet I think that there are writers -- Armantrout is a good example -- who
use revision to heighten every effect in the work and result in exactly the
opposite kind of writing. And that excites me enormously.

All of which is to say that I don't think there is a right or wrong position
vis a vis revision, it all depends on how it is being used.

Hi Jacques and all, I was planning to go into retirement but my name on the
list sparks my insane devotion to it.

In response to Jacques's post

1.Well I wish academics would spend a little more time working on their
charisma.
2. I don't quite remember "sexing" theory in any of my posts, but I am not
surprised to hear it read that way.
3. Surely we can agree Jacques that the way literary history is made by
academics is a power negotiation, or is at least not void of power struggles.
4. I wish academics would spend a little more time working on their charisma.
5. I really do.

Is anyone here in a position to refer me to THE groundbreaking texts re:
feminism and 'embodiment,' 'the body,' etc., especially w/ respect to
contemporary poetry&poetics?

I know bits of the philosophical background in Husserl and Merleau-Ponty,
and the science-tech-studies arguments in Donna Haraway and N. Katherine
Hayles. But where does one begin with post-'2nd wave' U.S. feminism per
se? Susan Bordo? Judith Butler? Elizabeth Grosz? I'm ignorant.

Backchannel? thanks

Well now I can't stop and it's unfortunate.

In that Childbirth & Metaphor thread a few weeks back someone posted a
dismissive note about women writers in the 70s having to write novels about
the birth of their first child and how tedious all that was to see on the
bestseller list or whatever. That came back to me a couple of times while
sitting around. And all I could think was, remember back in all those
centuries when all those men writings just had to write down everything they
thought of and also how those doctors didn't wash their hands and women died
in childbirth.

And as for Wendy's question, thanks for asking, I had a good time at the
Myles and Treadwell reading, poisonally!

Nabokov may be an even more extreme pole in this revision spectrum: he
famously said "There's no such thing as a good reader, only a good
re-reader," and would probably have said the same about writing, except
that he claimed to have a crystalline pre-existing vision of the entire
structure of his works in his head in advance. (He wrote the chapters of
SPEAK MEMORY out of order as NEW YORKER essays; he claims to have written
all of I think PALE FIRE on index cards in arbitrary order and then just
shuffled them into place. In fact, he did revise, and even [after much
ranting and raving] usually accepted his wife's quiet suggestions: "You
can't say that in English, dear.")

Here are two yummy quotes on the topic from his novel THE REAL LIFE OF
SEBASTIAN KNIGHT, his first to be written directly in English. The
narrator, V., is trying to write a biography of his brother, a writer. It
tracks a kind of transition from Kerouacesque to Gardneresque.

================

Between some legal documents I found a slip of paper on which he had begun
to write a story--there was only one sentence, stopping short but it gave
me the opportunity of observing the queer way Sebastian had--in the process
of writing--of not striking out the words which he had replaced by others,
so that, for instance, the phrase I encountered ran thus: "As he a heavy A
heavy sleeper, Roger Rogerson, old Rogerson bought old Rogers bought, so
afraid Being a heavy sleeper, old Rogers was so afraid of missing
to-morrows. He was a heavy sleeper. He was mortally afraid of missing
to-morrow's event glory early train glory so what he did was to buy and
bring home in a to buy that evening and bring home not one but eight alarm
clocks of different sizes and vigour of ticking nine eight eleven alarm
clocks of different sizes ticking which alarm clocks nine alarm clocks as a
cat has nine which he placed which made his bedroom look rather like a"
     I was sorry it stopped here.

===================

except for a few odd pages dispersed among other papers, he himself had
destroyed them [i.e., drafts etc.] long ago, for he had belonged to that
rare type of writer who knows that nothing ought to remain except the
perfect achievement: the printed book; that its actual existence is
inconsistent with that of its spectre, the uncouth manuscript flaunting its
imperfections like a revengeful ghost carrying its own head under its arm;
and that for this reason the litter of the workshop, no matter its
sentimental or commercial value, must never subsist

===================

I'm interested in this question about revision, because I'm deeply drawn to
art works that put something out there and take it back at the same time so
that what's left is a kind of shimmering residual glow. For example, the
first Nabokov quote above. For another example: in a drawing class I took
once, our assignment was to draw drapery by means of a method called
"modelling" -- you "build up" the form, rather than drawing the surface you
see. What this means, in practical terms, is lightly putting in a tone with
a soft charcoal and then wiping it away with a tissue; lightly putting in a
tone with a soft charcoal and then wiping it away with a tissue; lightly
putting in a tone with a soft charcoal and then wiping it away with a
tissue; literally dozens or hundreds of times for every area of the paper.
You do it, you erase it, and what's eventually left is something deeper
than the surface, something solid and three-dimensional and REAL. For a
poetry example: Mayrocker's WITH EACH CLOUDED PEAK.

But the book that captures, like no other book I know, this condition or
rhythm or balance between melancholy and wonder, between engagement with
the world and skepticism about the tools one has for that engagement
(understanding, love, communication) is TO THE LIGHTHOUSE. This happens in
the imagery (e.g. waves crashing and receding). It also happens in the
book's structure: the second section is the "taking away" of all that we
have invested in the specificities of character from section 1, and yet
what's left is not nothing, but rather a sort of tone or undertow --
undertone? -- underlying section three. That's my experience of how the
(my) past does underlie the (my) present. And this process I've been trying
to describe is also the story of Lily's painting. The book's last paragraph
is a perfect miniature symphony of balance between the power and the limits
of making an "attempt at something" -- "It would be hung in attics, she
thought; it would be destroyed. But what did that matter? she asked
herself, taking up the brush again." Does the line in the center connect or
divide? Both.

And, to answer Patrick's question practically, I tend to believe in the
power and the glory of revision, but I always seem to like the things I
write quickly and in one go better, both immediately and over time, than
the things I labor over (translations excepted). I take this to mean that
I'm a dilettante, not a real writer ("A professional writer is one who can
do his [sic] best work when he's [sic] not in the mood" -- Graham Greene).

Sorry to go on so -- I should have revised more ("I'm sorry my letter is so
long; I didn't have time to write a shorter one" -- Diderot or Voltaire, I
forget),

Actually, I could have phrased that better.

What I'm particularly interested in are recent feminist critiques of
'disembodiment' in postmodernist literature or theory. Again, partic. as
they relate to poetry/etics.

They're pretty different from the work you're planning to use, but David
Lee's pig farming poems (_The Porcine Canticles_, _The Porcine Legacy_)
are interesting examples of rural dialect poems.  They're also brutal and
hilarious.

A videotape of Louise Bennett -- Miss Lou and Friends -- is available from
Reckord Films Limited in Kingston, 809-924-1903 or 809-975-3219.  Her
routine was by then (1990) fairly stylized (it presents her singing her
lyrics and telling some tales in concert) but excellent for your purposes,
I think.  There are tapes of Bill Herbert and Kathleen Jamie reading work
that uses a lot of Scots, available from Amazon.com.uk, too -- any
Macdiarmid recordings out there?  Hope others post to the list on this --
would love to hear more.

Please tell me about a poetry that demonstrates how to take ideas seriously.
Seriously. This is sounding to me like the vague complaints I heard when
first reading poems from disenfranchised poetry admirers that the poetry I
mentioned to them did not engage, was not about life, etc etc. At that time,
I decided these were people equipped with some other experience - now I'm
more sympathetic. Maybe the same will happen wrt to *ideas* - which, as I've
mentioned here before, seems to be something of a magic word in poetryland
these days.

In good faith -

The Jade


Confucius, Analects X 5, Waley translation: When carrying the tablet of
jade, he seems to double up, as though borne down by its weight. He holds
it at the highest as though he were making a bow, at the lowest, as though
he were proffering a gift. His expression, too, changes to one of dread
and his feet seem to recoil, as though he were avoiding something. When
presenting ritual-presents, his expression is placid. At the private aud-
ience his attitude is gay and animated.

Legge translation: 1. When he was carrying the sceptre _of his ruler,_ he
seemed to bend his body, as if he were not able to bear its weight. He did
not hold it higher than the position of the hands in making a bow, nor
lower than their position in giving anything to another. His countenance
seemed to change, and look apprehensive, and he dragged his feet along as
if they were held by something to the ground. 2. In presenting the pre-
sents _with which he was charged,_ he wore a placid appearance. 3. At his
private audience, he looked highly pleased.

He was doing what, a good deed, he was unhappy. Smiling, he looked up with
the ritual jade held high, his feet close to the ground, slightly angled.
He proffered a ritual object to another, the jade, what, held high, his
pace solemn, his expression one of happiness. Crying, but befit a man, he
bent his body close to the ground, the piece of ritual jade held high.
Quietly, in rage, he shuffled his feet, nimbly moving among the pillars of
the great hall, the gift of jade in his pleasant hands. Angrily, he strode
across the floor of the outer pavilion, the jade weighing heavily in his
hands held high. He was doing something, what, for his private audience.
He looked highly pleased, miserable, somewhat animated.

Subject:      Re ASondheim on Sunset Blvd.'s Cameras
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Thank you, Alan.  Casting the net further:

In 1935, the Korean modernist Yi Sang, depressed after witnessing the first
screening of a motion picture (sponsored by the Japanese colonial
government) in the village he's passing through, writes:

"The simple-hearted emptiness one tastes after seeing a motion
picture--Chang Chou's butterfly dream was probably something like this.  My
flat, round head becomes a camera, and how many times did my tired *double
lens* shoot and project poignant scenes of corn ripening in early autumn?
Delicate sorrow flowing in a *flashback*--broken-hearted *stills* to send
to a few lonely *fans* back in the city."
--From "Sanch'on yeojeong" [Lingering Thoughts of a Mountain Village]

The *s indicate where YS used a transcription into Korean of the English
word.  The "double lens" is his eyeglasses.  Chang Chou's dream is, of c,
from the _Chuang-tzu_, i. e. one way to rephrase the sentence is to imagine
YS asking,
"Am I a camera that has just dreamt I was Yi Sang watching a movie, or Yi
Sang dreaming that I am a movie camera?  Between Yi Sang and a movie camera
there must be some distinction."

And yes, Korean intellectuals were well aware of Dziga Vertov, etc., by the
late 1920s.  At the end of the piece, YS describes including a suicide note
w the ms. he's mailing back to Seoul--the cost of being racked over in this
particularly modern way.

>In Sunset Boulevard, Desmond speaks about her
silence; Max is silent about her speech; the noise is filled by the
writer. It is not a displacement of silence by sound or of one
constitution by another, but of spaces by times, times by spaces, air by
water, water by air. At the end the dead writer speaks.

At the end the drowned writer is racked over and it's there after that
time he can start writing.

POETRY CENTER 2000
The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

a reading & celebration in honor of Etel Adnan's 75th birthday
ETEL ADNAN &
RABIH ALAMEDDINE
Thursday March 30, 7:30 pm, $5
@ The Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)
San Francisco

[PLEASE NOTE:  Due to health constraints, Etel Adnan is unable to travel to
attend this evening's event.  Simone Fattal will read instead from Ms.
Adnan's work, and we'll listen to British composer Gavin Bryar's "Adnan
Songbook," and also exhibit several of Etel Adnan's hand-calligraphed
books, which have been shown internationally.  The evening will conclude
with Rabih Alameddine reading from his own fiction.]

ETEL ADNAN has been a vital presence--as teacher, visual artist, poet,
prose writer, and thinker--for years in the common consciousness of writers
and artists not just in our backyard but seemingly across half the world.
*  A native of Beirut, Lebanon, and long-time resident of the Bay Area,
she's the author of numerous works of prose and poetry, including the
internationally renowned novel of the Lebanese civil war, SITT MARIE ROSE
and the recent long prose-poem THERE.  *  Gavin Bryars has set her "Love
Songs" to music, recorded on his CD Cadman Requiem as Adnan Songbook, and
she's worked with director Robert Wilson, as well as the great actress
Jeanne Moreau, among others.  *  It's a true pleasure for The Poetry Center
to honor her on this extraordinary anniversaire.  *

RABIH ALAMEDDINE is a novelist and a painter, born and raised in Beirut,
Lebanon, and living in San Francisco.   *  His first novel, KOOLAIDS: The
Art of War, is a truly outstanding literary accomplishment--a beautiful
work of imaginative and piercingly acute intelligence that manages somehow
to be deeply moving, ironic, and excitingly new in its possibilities.  *
Mr. Alameddine's first book of stories, THE PERV, is just out.  *

SIMONE FATTAL is an artist and translator, and the publisher of Post-Apollo
Press.  Born in Damascus, Syria, Ms. Fattal has lived in Beirut, in Paris,
and in the Bay Area.

And the wind

                        - Suhayi Saadi


This particular book - representative of the series - also makes
manifests a vitality in literary editing and publishing which refuses
to be constrained by Anglo-Saxon sensibilities (by turns: carping,
chip-on-shoulder, faded-imperialist, outright elitist, complacent,
ghettoized) and thankfully demonstrates that old saltatorial link
between independent Scotland and the continent.

Get it direct or from a local/specialist bookseller.

Taylor,
Work it out, baby!

and I'd just like to add that "jefa" is spanish for "boss" in the feminine,
jefe in the masculine.  Just a coincidental little aside.

> Since you seem to be including music, a listen to Fela Kuti's "Original

> Found this while looking for an answer to Mackey's question, in the

>
> Michael Smith, It a Come (alongside Linton Kwesi Johnson - also Brathwaite's

>
> Slave narratives collected by the Federal Writers' Project, many of them

novels are wholly driven by dialogue and therefore dialect.  Since you
mentioned blues, her CORREGIDORA is of note) and William Melvin Kelley's
DUNSFORD TRAVELS EVERYWHERES, if you can find a copy.  I think it's out of
print, unfortunately.  Zora Neale Hurston's work may be of interest as well,
from THERE EYES WERE WATCHING GOD on.

And I'm thinking of Stephen Crane's short story "The Open Boat", because the
characters each have a particular regional or ethnic speech pattern that no
one in a class years ago questioned when we read it, but when we followed
with a story by Toni Cade Bambara (I think it was "The Lesson"), people
freaked out about how distracting "Black english" was, etc. etc., so I never
forgot that story.

I also recommend R. Zamora Linmark's ROLLING THE R's, and Jessica Hagedorn's
work, especially the shorter work in PETFOOD AND OTHER APPARITIONS, and
perhaps some passages from DOGEATERS.

All of Kamau Braithwaite's work.
Paule Marshall has some nice renderings of Bajan (Barbadian) speech in her
work as well.

Xam Wilson Cartier  namely her BE-BOP, RE-BOP (backchannel me on this if you
like, I have a tape of her reading from this.)

Also of note is Patrick Chamoiseau's SCHOOL DAYS, in which both the speaker
in the novel, a chorus of unruly children, and the author of the novel
discuss/debate the veracity of the given translation of Martinican creole
into "french-french" then into english.  It's hilarious.  The creoles of the
Francophone Caribbean are beautiful to the eye, as to the ear, in my
opinion.

Another good text is AMERICA SPEAKS, which has a wonderful assortment of
sounds and looks of different peoples' thoughts.

For rap, I recommend The Pharcyde, particularly the cut they did especially
for the "Red, Hot & Cool" CD.

Hinglish (Hindi english) is also something to look out for, very interesting
for syntax and word usage, mix of British english and Hindi.  See Ginu
Kamani's JUNGLEE GIRL.

The terms "downpress" and "overstand" immediately come to mind, from reggae
music.  Dancehall, too, could be good to get into.

What about Tolkien and Lewis Carroll?  One person's nonsense is another
persons mother tongue, after all...that's how I felt about Chaucer, Beowulf
and Sir Gawain when I was a resistant bulbe.

Hope this helps!

It is fascinating to observe how significantly times have changed when you
have a Language Poet complaining about the *artifice*--of metafiction!  Would

i think we need to get away from the concept of "THE groundbreaking texts"
as that concept tends to reify thinking and social movements, associating
ideas instead with a few smart people who published.  i  genuinely
appreciate your desire to learn; the way the question worded, though,
foregrounds a key problematic in feminist theory and feminist intellectual
practice.

many many "second wave" feminists, particularly the french, but also,  in a
different way, americans, took "embodiment" as one of their primary sites
for investigation, starting with the by-now cliche notion that since women
have traditionally been associated w/ the body and men w/ the mind, women
might have an interesting textual relationship to bodily matters, and women
might in fact take advantage of that association to make texts more
embodied (i'm thinking here of the french --cixous and irigaray in
particular).  also, it seems that (and here we're getting beyond the
literary) one strand in questions of "embodiment" might well be that of
labor --women's work, which tends to be invisible or at least not
heroically acclaimed...etc etc. ...

I'm just now teaching a seminar on theories of embodiment & corporeality (
www.ship.edu/~mwbibb/504page.html ).  Kristeva's *Revolution in Poetic
Language* and *Powers of Horror* offer some interesting connections between
poetry and embodiment, although I personally find her a bit too
essentialist.  I found the E. Grosz book *Volatile Bodies* very useful, as it
gives a fairly engaging overview of the various theoretical positions and
philosophical background to 2nd wave feminist theories of bodies.  It's also
interesting how Grosz's book calls attention to Spinoza and the possibilities
of Deleuze-Guattari for feminist theory.  Bordo seems to oversimplify, I
think--her work is very good for basic cultural analysis, but rather short on
theory.  Butler is, of course, most often cited, and ultimately I feel that
her work poses some very important questions for feminism and theories of
embodiment.  Butler is, I think, the most "groundbreaking" right now--that
is, her work seems to have set the agenda for most discussions on these
issues--but I also feel personally that Grosz is very important and useful.
Other than Kristeva, though, I can't really think of a "groundbreaking"
feminist take on contemporary poetry/poetix (altho K is decidedly *modernist*
in orientation) and embodiment.

The Tredyffrin Public Library is located at 582 Upper Gulph Rd.
Strafford-Wayne, PA 19087-2052

From the Schuylkill, take the 202 South exit at King of Prussia and
get off at S. Warner Road (before actually going onto 202). Make a
left at Old Eagle School Road and go over the hill. Make another left
at Upper Gulph Road and proceed several blocks to the library. The
library will be on your left.

From Route 30 heading West, make a right onto E. Conestoga Road. At
the 3-way intersection make a hard right onto Upper Gulph Road and go
slightly more than one block. The library will be on your right.

To reach the library by Septa, take the R5 Thorndale/Paoli train and
get off at the Strafford Station. Make a right turn out of the
parking lot and walk to Homestead Road. Make a left and walk up
Homestead to Upper Gulph Road – the Library is just to your right on
Upper Gulph.

Subject: dorky? scholarly question, TAKE 2


Actually, I could have phrased that better.

What I'm particularly interested in are recent feminist critiques of
'disembodiment' in postmodernist literature or theory. Again, partic. as
they relate to poetry/etics.

thanks

Subject:      poetry and 'ideas'
MIME-Version: 1.0

My own feeling was that Jacques was indulging in some broadly provocative
rhetoric, of a kind which, I must say, I enjoy greatly myself --- both
giving and getting. Yet it occurs to me, watching the objections pour in,
that this allergy to ideas of which Jacques speaks is far less easily
targetable to many people 'here' (i.e., on THIS list) than 'elsewhere'
(e.g., OTHER lists -- at least here, one can say 'Hegel' without inviting
an avalanche of 'burn-the-critic' backchannels). Perhaps Jacques would
disagree, though, and I certainly don't mean to minimize or deflect his
point.

For the record: the notion of "poets' resistance to 'ideas'" doesn't seem
to me overly mysterious or unfounded. There *is* an impulse (where, or on
what scale, is another question), often an identifiably American impulse,
to separate 'theory' or 'philosophy' (= 'ideas') from something called
'experience' --- a category that presumably excludes the life-time spent
reading books of 'theory' or 'philosophy' --- and then to use 'experience'
to devalue theory/philosophy/ideas as somehow not involved with or
connected to real life.

It was sad to hear through The New York Times and the Los Angeles
Times yesterday of the death of noted novelist Anthony Powell.
Powell belonged to the age of the great "dialogue" novelists such as
Ronald Firbank (whose presence Powell made known through his
republication of Firbank's work when he was editor at Duckworth),
Henry Green, Elizabeth Bowen, Evelyn Waugh, and Ivy Compton-
Burnett. These authors, Powell most among them, were great writers
of wit in a time when grace and wit were more common.

Among Powell's many important works are Afternoon Men, From a
View to a Death, Venusburg, What Became of Waring? and the 12-
volume series of novels THE DANCE TO THE LMUSIC OF TIME, one
of the great achievements of 20th century fiction.

Powell was born in 1905, and was 94 at the time of his death at his
home in Frome, near Somerset, England.

Sun & Moon Press (and soon Green Integer) has published and will
be publishing several of Powell's works.

In memory of this great author, I am offering two novels, Oh, How the
Wheel Becomes It! and Afternoon Men at 20% discount to anyone who =
mentions this notice.

Gillespie's Syntactic Revolution can still be found in libraries, and I've
posted some of his stuff at my website, though as I scanned the material in
it may have some typos (I tried to proofread it, but he writes like Joyce on
speed and with two left thumbs at the typewriter).  I had a weird
conversation with the editor of the book whom I had contacted regarding
posting this stuff -- he couldn't have cared less, he only published the
book to fulfill a promise to some friend of his who had started it.
Gillespie's family disowned him when he became a poet; consequently, like
Duncan he was cross-eyed, and like me he was a diabetic, but both things
happened when he got into a car accident -- a precursor -- and he lived to
almost tell about it (he was very "normal" before then, as the early writing
in this book shows)!  He actually looked a little like Duncan in middle-age
(like Duncan looked in middle age) which was kind of blandly handsome with a
touch of the eccentric just beginning to blossom.  I think he was a
Philadelphia native, and he used to talk like he wrote, apparently.  Anyway,
Bernstein has written about him in Poetry of the Americas and I think the
Artifice of Absorption, and other works can be found in Revolution of the
Word, the anthology edited by that guy, what's his name, can never remember,
the anthology guy.

I liked your post a lot -- it suggests what I think is that perhaps obvious
dichotomy between essentialism and contingency, that poems don't have values
that are always "there" even prior to one having read them.  This is the
problem with one's initial reading of "classics" or revered authors, that
one is expecting some dramatic rush of meaning and excitement from them
since they metynomically represent "poetry" but it never arrives in the same
way it's announced.  Most of my favorite poets are ones I've more or less
despised at some point in my life (Hopkins, Ashbery, O'Hara, Bernstein, are
all poets I would have, at one point, thought were terrible), but when the
understanding and the interest finally arose, it had nothing with the words
on the page being any different, nor did it have anything to do with the
critical atmosphere (there are enough revered poets who I think are pretty
terrible).

As for taste and form, I tried to shock my friends this evening by
announcing not only that I had Miles Champion's new book in my backpack, but
I also had Anthony Hecht's!  (We had just left a Frank O'Hara celebration
with Elsmlie, Myles, Yau, etc., so I thought it would go over well).  I work
at Random House, and they, meaning Knopf, were tossing out all of these
books, so I picked them up -- I have the complete Hecht, Kenneth Koch,
Sharon Olds, and Mark Strand, now -- a motley bunch -- don't know who will
make it to the permanent collection.  Anyway, I used to like a poem of
Hecht's quite a bit when I was younger -- "The Feast of Stephen" it was
called -- though not most of his writing at all (it reminded me of the
drunken spats in Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf, but without the fine accents
and terrifying wit -- kind of like hard-boiled Robert Lowell).  This one had
texture, though, and lines like "the kilowatts of noon", which I thought was
cool at the time.  And I kind of admire his sticking to his guard about
being  a "formalist" -- he's practically founded a generation of poets, but
I think he was the only one in his time (meaning those decades ago) writing
quite like that -- there were the Wilburs and Merrills, but Hecht seemed to
want to really be Alexander Pope, or someone from another age (I admire Amy
Clampitt for her engagement with older poetries as well).  Well, reading the
poems now I do still think that, technically, he's a virtuoso -- I think,
for example, his imitations of (the meters derived from) formal speech and
use of meter surpasses most of what I read of Duncan's "derivative" poems in
his later books, which always struck me as stilted, or even some bits of
Pound which are too large-scale (and he wasn't no wit) to be subtle, and he
finds a way to use the forms in a satirical fashion without being suburban
(there must be life outside the suburbs), which is to say Hecht has that
sense of "play" that the metaphysic poets were so good at, and he is never
behind a pulpit quite like Duncan (who, I think, was better at something
else).  Nonetheless, the occasional (perhaps profound) sexism in his,
Hecht's, work, keeps me at a good distance -- it's not just his sexism but
that of the class he seems to want to represent -- which points, by
extension, to his refusal to engage with any aspects of the "dialect of his
tribe", to somehow deal in a lively way with the things of this, our
present-day, world -- to be numerous, to question assumptions.  His being
"above it all" smacks of a true conservatism that spreads out horizontally,
like a stain on the landscape.  He would probably hate everything I stand
for, helas.  Eventually, a "political" reading of his work would have to get
in the way -- strangely, I was reading Terry Eagleton on Yeats and pleasure
just yesterday and he says much the same thing -- if you're an Irish
nationalist and sensitive to sexism you are going to find his "terrible
beauty" hard to swallow.  So anyway, this issue of "taste" -- which is so
complicated -- the idea of a "standard" for reading poetry, of course, seems
impossible, but it's an interesting idea.

Any Anthony Hecht fans in the audience?

One thing I think of when I meet a poet, or a question I used to ask, is:
who were you obsessed with as you were learning to write, or who seemed to
take you over for a time?  I think most poets went through a time when they
engaged in some sort of imitative phase, and I think it's a round-the-clock,
creates-arguments-with-your-family, makes-you-eat-poorly kind of phase,
which is to say kind of extreme.  I'm not sure that any critic -- who will
want to claim a large portion of the "field" to maintain a decent
reputation -- is quite capable of this kind of insanity.  Luckily as poets
we don't have to insanely like every poet the cat dragged in.

Does this make sense?

</bigger>New Sculptures

by

<bigger>Lars Chellberg



</bigger>6 April - 6 May at

Lance Fung Gallery, 537 Broadway NYC


Reception for the artist:

Thursday, 6 April, 6-8 PM


Ornithologicalengineerology, a solo exhibition of new work by
Earth/Installation artist, Lars Chellberg, opens April 6th at Lance
Fung Gallery. In his current exhibit Mr. Chellberg explores the future
effects of man's intervention and interface with ecosystems and their
various species.


Building on the success of his first solo exhibition, By Force of
Habit, also at Lance Fung Gallery, Mr. Chellberg advances an ongoing
investigation between science and the natural world. Previously known
for introducing hundreds of live crickets into his work to create
unique sound sculptures and for entering into collaboration with giant
live spiders to produce ephemeral spider-web-drawings, in the present
exhibit Chellberg forshadows particular results of humanly engineered
ecosystems. With the decisive hand of an architect and the sensitivity
of a naturalist, Chellberg manufactures the future of bird nests.
Similar to Gordon Matta-Clark who designed floating and pop houses,
tree houses and other alternative housing, Chellberg creates nests for
the genetically engineered bird.


Mr. Chellberg's nests are made from architectural model building
supplies representing the standard skeletal material in I-beams.
Constructed by the artist as if he were a genetically engineered bird,
the I-beams come together in a seemingly haphazard fashion - yet the
nests they structure are sturdy and ready for habitation. In tandem
with his synthetic nests, the artist displays collected nests from a
natural forest to further illustrate the co-mingling of natural and
human constructs. Mr. Chellberg suspends, rests and cantilevers all the
works outside the gallery's windows contrasting with the backdrop of
Broadway's 19th century building facades.


The gallery's main exhibition space, which typically houses monumental
and ambitious installations by artists such as Shigeko Kubota (Sexual
Healing) or Joshua Selman (Off The Grid,) remains virtually empty. In
Chellberg's void hangs a single swing which he makes beckon viewers to
use, while a symphony of sound plays birdcalls ironically electronic in
origin. Will the design of species lead to the need to engineer
environments to accommodate biological species humans have created? How
will genetically designed species accept transition to wild existence?
What will a projection of the world, fully re-created, and under our
necessary stewardship, look like? Lance Fung Gallery, Lars Chellberg
and Ornithologicalengineerology attempt to open a space for these
considerations and inspire further investigation.

Masterclass with Joachim Schlömer on Monday, April 17, 2000, at ODC Theatre
Admission $ 10
For information, call 415 863-9830


ODC Theater and the Goethe-Institut present the world premiere of SUITE OF
MULTIPLE ATTITUDES: Joachim Schlömer - choreographer, dancer and director of
the internationally acclaimed Tanztheater Basel from Switzerland and Peter
Kowald, artist, musician and "maybe the best improvising bass player in the
world" (Wired magazine), collaborate on their third creation. David Finn,
lighting designer for Mikhail Baryshnikov's White Oak Dance Project and San
Francisco resident, co-produced the SUITE, and is also responsible for the
lighting design of this piece.

SUITE OF MULTIPLE ATTITUDES is an investigation into personality and
attitude working off one another. Based on Kowald's work as a bass player,
this improvised piece examines the depths and layers of inner self and how
it can be translated through musical expression. Schlömer uses the musical
surface and beat as a "surfboard" to balance the particulars of his own
personality through movement.

Both performers offer a perspective of the individual from within and from
afar; they explore character intuitively by stepping outside of themselves
and reacting to the inner self with ease. Their performance is inspired by
sound elements such as live radio and recordings, silence and each other's
movements. By interacting with the energy of the public, the performers
derive values, qualities, humor, and awareness from the setting of each
individual performance which is unique and different each time.

Japanese Lecture Series at the Asian Art Museum
Western Influence on Japanese Wood-block-prints (ukiyoe-e)
by Dr. Claudia Delank
Friday, April 28, 2000
10 a.m. - 12 p.m.
General Admission: $7
co-presented by the Goethe Institut and the Museum of Asian Art


The Asian Art Museum’s finale to their introductory survey of the arts of
Japan, covering the art and culture from the Heian period to the twentieth
century, will be  a lecture by art historian Claudia Delank. Focusing on the
perspective and the role of the Akita school of painting in relation to
Japanese woodblock-print (ukiyo-e), Dr. Delank will discuss the influence of
Western art on such landscapes as those of Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849)
and Ando Hiroshige (1797-1858).

In the Tokugawa-Era between 1603 and 1868, Japanese woodblock-print was a
popular art form among the townspeople of Edo, today’s Tokyo. During these
years, a time of national seclusion, the only window to the west was
provided by Deshima, Nagasaki, where the Dutch had set up a trade port.

Claudia Delank is Art Historian and Assistant Professor for Japanese History
of Art at the Seminar for Oriental History of Art, University of
Bonn/Germany. After receiving her Ph.D. in 1981 at the University of Cologne
in English Literature and History of Far Eastern Art she lectured at the
Tohoku University, Sendai/Japan from 1982 to 1985 as well as at the
University of Cologne from1986-1995. In 1996 she opened a gallery for Far
Eastern and Contemporary Art in Bremen, Germany.

Dr. Delank has published many books and articles on Japanese art and its
interrelation with Western art, such as "The Bauhaus and Japan",   "The
Sculpture of Enku (1632 - 1695)” and “Japanese wood-art of the 1980’s and
1990’s". She regularly lectures on these topics in an international setting,
the most recent being at the symposium "The Reception of the Far East in the
Shadow of the World Wars - Universalism and Nationalism" at the University
of Bayreuth, Germany in March 2000.
