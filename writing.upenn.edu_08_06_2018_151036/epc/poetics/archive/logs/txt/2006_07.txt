*About The Wandering Hermit Review*

The Wandering Hermit Review is a digest size, perfect-bound journal of
150-200 pages that comes out annually. In the spirit of d. a. levy, the
Hermit is a 100% d.i.y. mag printed via home computer/laser printer and
bound by hand in the editor's kitchen using plywood and spring clamps.
We're
happy to report that people often don't believe that when they first
see the
mag which looks pretty slick, if we do say so ourselves. The Wandering
Hermit features an eclectic blend of writing and visual art ranging
from the
wildly experimental to the fairly traditional. We love finding common
elements in the work of writers coming from radically different
aesthetic
backgrounds and enjoy placing them side-by-side.

Lawmaker Wants UW Lecturer Fired Over 9/11 Views
Barrett Expressed Views On Milwaukee Radio Show

http://www.channel3000.com/news/9457154/detail.html

POSTED: 7:04 pm CDT June 30, 2006
UPDATED: 10:01 pm CDT June 30, 2006

MADISON, Wis. -- University of Wisconsin-Madison officials are =20
reviewing the background of a UW-Madison lecturer after a state =20
lawmaker demanded he be fired for his beliefs about Sept. 11, 2001.

Kevin Barrett has a doctorate and lectures on Islamic culture and =20
religion. He is also co-founder of a group that believes some in our =20
government arranged the Sept. 11 attacks.

In some circles, especially academic ones, the debate over what =20
really happened on Sept. 11 continues. The issue now is whether such =20
radical beliefs belong in the college classroom.

Most Americans believe that on Sept. 11 the United States was =20
attacked by 19 Arab hijackers commanded by al-Qaida and Osama bin =20
Laden. But some conspiracy-based groups, like Barrett's Muslim-Jewish-=20=

Christian Alliance For 9/11 Truth, think that's "a lie."

Barrett believes evidence compiled by others show that Dick Cheney =20
and others inside the U.S. government arranged the 9/11 attacks -- =20
and he said so Wednesday on a Milwaukee radio show.

"The alternative theory is that they must have at least had some =20
inside help, and more likely that the whole thing was an inside job =20
from start to finish," Barrett said. "By far the strongest hypothesis =20=

at this point is that 9/11 was an inside job designed as a war-=20
trigger cover operation =85 designed to launch a series of wars -- not =20=

just one war but a long series of wars."

Barrett wears his activism on his sleeve -- wearing a shirt with his =20
Web site's address on the back.

But one state lawmaker said that such beliefs have no place in a =20
state-sponsored classroom, and he wants Barrett to be fired.

"This is preposterous, and there are better people who could teach in =20=

the classroom," said Rep. Steve Nass, a Republican from Whitewater.

The UW-Madison provost said he is reviewing Barrett's background to =20
double-check his credentials.

The UW Board of Regents said that is appropriate but said outrageous =20
viewpoints are part of academic freedom.

"I think outrageous ideas are best given the light of day. And given =20
the light of day, the university system will expose them for what =20
they are," said Dave Walsh, president of the Board of Regents.

But Nass thinks that Barrett's views go too far for the classroom.

"By the university standards, Adolf Hitler could speak in a classroom =20=

-- and that would be free speech and academic freedom," he said.

Walsh said he thinks Barrett's ideas are "beyond preposterous," too, =20
but said they still shouldn't be excluded from a college classroom.

Barrett said he is fine with the provost's review and said that =20
during his contemporary Islam course on culture and religion he =20
presents all viewpoints in a fair and balanced way.

As for being called a "wacko" by some, Barrett said a recent Zogby =20
poll found that 42 percent believe the 9/11 commission report =20
concealed evidence and is covering up the truth.=

I don't think anyone has yet mentioned Kenneth Koch's strange book
from Soft Skull called The Art of the Possible, a collection of
poetry comic strips in his, um, inimitable style.

There were also collaborative poetry comics by Joe Brainard and Ron
Padgett back in the 60s and 70s.

it isn't partic po-related, but if we're talkin comics on the web, you gotta
check out http://www.zark.com . this started in 95 or 96, more or less the
beginning of web time. i'd suggest you start at
http://www.zark.com/pages/aztitle.html , ie, from the start. this is 'argon
zark' by charley parker.

i don't think he's done anything with this for several years, maybe even
since about 2000, but it's still worth checking out.

the news section at http://www.zark.com/front/news.html was last updated in
2005. i see there mention of a couple of inarestin books: "a history of web
comics" and "the artistic history of web comics".

here's another web-based comic proj: http://artcontext.org/act/05/panel ;
this is 'panel junction' by andy deck (ny). in one sense, this is actually a
software art project. deck wrote software to support a
community/collaborative creation of panels of comics. i see 12 finished
panels.

French Rioters Release Hip-Hop CD

C7 H16 releases "G la rage et je la garde"
["I have rage and i'm keeping it. I'm pissed and i'm staying pissed..."]

A quick translation of the intro of the CD (also the intro on the website):

In the beginning of the winter, the suburbs have been set on fire and
that's a good thing. In the middle of the urbanisation of capitalism,
there is nothing more to hope for, nothing more to win...a lot of us
have played with a bit of fire. (a lot have paid some joy of fire)

Our hatred is not negotiable, from generation to generation, it's the
same shit. Confronting the State and its representatives, those who walk
up straight while we are slaves. That's the meaning of the rioters,
those who have rage, those who don't want the life they're condemned to.

Nothing new, and nothing is finished, it has only begun. The fire spread
everywhere. And it will spread again, from itself, because this revolt
is more profound than any word of order.

Hey, I got in a really good discussion the other day about Langston
Hughes' blues poems
(and yes I know that he recorded quite a few of them) and their
relationship to the blues lyrics
of, for instance, the folks above, or John Lee Hooker, Big Mama
Thornton, Ma Rainey, etc---

And if anybody else here would maybe be interested in talking about
that relationship here--
Does it matter that Hughes worked primarily in a different field (in
the artistic specialization sense) than these other folks?
Is it somewhat analogous to the difference between, say, million
selling hip hop artists today vs. a slam poet aesthetic which
utilizes many devices of rap/hip hop?
Or, for that matter, even the difference between say Bob Dylan and
Allen Ginsberg's songs?

There's alot of room for discussion (and, sure, bring on the "blues
bashers" though I'm definitely trying to
avoid the tired argument "it doesn't stand up on the page" and will
try not to engage it here if it comes up)--
Also, if anybody knows of any good essays on the subject----
specifically about Hughes and some of the other recorded bluesmen of
the 20th C---that'd be a nice supplement, but I really am not a big
fan of posts that just send LINKS
without any commentary as to why I'm supposed to check out the
link......
a discussion might be nice (but be careful what you ask for, Chris---)

well, the one obvious intersection is that moment at Newport when the Muddy
Waters band plays the song that Hughes wrote while listening - I think it's on
the Muddy at Newport album, but don't have it in front of me -

And don't be so quick to dismiss that "it doesn't hold up on the page" objection
-- Most popular song lyrics don't hold up in the absence of music, and were
never intended to  -- there are, of course, numerous exceptions -- so let's not
rush to make that a general rule any more than we rush to rule out the
page/stage distinctions --

there are blues lyrics that hold up quite well:

I'm going down to the river, gonna take my rocking chair;
If the blues overtake me, I'll rock on out of there.


and there are blues lyrics that don't hold up so well-- which is one reason I
just love those loving transcriptions that reverently preserve every "uh huh"
etc.

Buddy Guy singng "Heard people tell, the mighty dollar done fell" - is poetry to
me -- John Lee Hooker's BOOGIE CHILDREN is a great record, but it will never
make compelling reading -- or reciting  --

the essential difference between those slam poets you mention (yes I know them .
. . I had to rearrange thir faces . . . ) and "hip hop artists, is the producer
--

there was never a blues poetry "scene" coincident in the same way with blues as
music in performance -- just several poets (Highes, Brown, Johnson) who
included the form in their repertoire -

Aldon----thanks for getting the ball rolling on this---One follow up
question for you would be, in reference to the "doesn't hold up to
the page" objection, would be this:
Given the fact that Hughes did publish them in his books, would you
say that Hughes' stand up on the page more so than the others? Do you
agree with the perception that Hughes was trying to confer a
specifically "literary" legitimacy onto this form on par with, say,
the more white euro form of the sonnet? Do you think he was trying to
de-alienate "literature" and "music" from each other as specialized
fields? As later, say, Baraka might be said to (or we could get into
Gil Scott Heron again I suppose)---

Your point about their being no blues literary scene is a good one I
think---and to me points to what is so, I'll say, pioneering about
what Hughes (and Johnson---I assume you mean james weldon not robert)
did----I'm trying to figure how this relates to this broader
(empirical, but probably controversial) observation in today's
society: In popular music, to a large extent, even the most white-
power culturally segratated whites, have to acknowledge the crucial
importance and influence and relevance of black musicians (though
perhaps less so now than 25-30 years ago)----Yet, in the field of
literature and poetry (if understood as cut off from music, and
specifically that which 'holds up well on the page'), there are still
quite a few 'well-intentioned' liberal whites groping desperately and/
or cluelessly to change their standards, or 'make exceptions,' when
it comes to considering the history of diaspora poetry (warning:
shorthand term) (Hughes being on the level of Pound or Williams, for
instance, is not heard as much as say Bird on the level of Stravinski
or 'the stones stole it from Chuck Berry')....   and what to make of
that, and where to go next....

(okay, that's my two posts for today....)

care to diff. the blues poems from the others

problem with form in Hughes (and h.r. in general), form in blues, form =
in
blues poems, and form in hughes' blues poems vs. Hughes other poems

what about the shout, the oral, etc.

to me this is COMPLETELY DIFF from slammers' "I'm "not" a "page poet" =
i.e. I
don't write, I speak or perform"

obviously I am working from performance poetry toward the blues, rather =
than
blues - poetry - performance or some other progression

All best,
Catherine

No, that's Fenton Johnson (not to be confused with the prose writer of our own
day) -- if James Weldon Johnson wrote much blues (in books, as opposed to his
song writing), I've forgotten it for the moment --

Some of Hughes's blues poems work for me, some don't -- in the same way that
some blues lyrics from recordings work when read without music, though most
don't -- since Hughes was (with the excpetion of songs, like the Newport
episode) writing for publication and reading in most instances, he was up to
something a bit different --

I doubt that Hughes would have been dealienating anything, but neither would he
have seen these at all as opposed enterprises --

Chris, you know me all to well to be tempting me to comment on the ways of white
liberal folk -- let's just say I know quite a few of them and actually prefer
their company to the O'Reilly's of the world, all of whom seem to have
appointed themseleves lately as the "TRUE" defenders of what Rev. King REALLY
meant --

To go back to Gil Scott Heron as you suggest slyly, who was the professor of the
only creative writing class I ever took, check out his monologue on Bluesology
-- great fun -- Gil once gave us an assignment to write something in which we
described all twelve members of a jury -- I wrote a blues to a Jimmy Reed tune
-- fortunately Reed wasn't nearby to hit me over the head -- Suffice it to say
that my lyric wouldn't survive (and indeed has not) on either the page or the
stage --

for me, and I hasten to add this is a highly personal opinion, blues, like jazz,
is more important to poetry as an analogue than as a form to be followed --
which is one reason I prefer the Hughes of ASK YOUR MAMA to most of his
individual blues poems --

July 22-July 27, 2006

Join poets Denise Duhamel and Nick Carbo, fiction writers April Smith
and Dan Wakefield for the fabulous Writers Week at the physically
invigorating, spiritually soothing, and creativity generating, world
famous spa called Rancho la Puerta in Tecate, Mexico. In the early
mornings you can hike one of many mountain trails, come back and have a
hydro massage before a delicious lunch, and then go to one of the
writer's workshops in the afternoon. Who says poets don't need
pampering? Even Bukowski had a couple of scalp massages during his
lifetime. Ooooooh, aaaaaaaaaaah.

My favorite activity was the labyrinth walk timed just right to catch
the sunrise over Mt. Kuchumaa as you reached the center of your
enlightenment.

The Associated Press

Published: July 3, 2006

China's first train from Beijing to Tibet made the
final leg of its two-day journey on the world's
highest railway, reaching Lhasa Monday after climbing
to high elevations that sickened passengers and tested
the specially built rail cars.

Girls, some dressed in track suits and others in
traditional Tibetan robes, draped white scarves, a
customary gift of greeting, on arriving passengers in
the newly built Lhasa railway station.

Many passengers spent the day coping with the
altitude, breathing piped-in oxygen from tubes as the
train passed its highest point, the 5,072-meter
(16,640-foot) Tanggula Pass. Three passengers threw
up, while others had headaches - both symptoms of
altitude sickness. Outside, Tibetan antelope and wild
donkeys grazed beneath snow-capped mountains and
deep-blue skies.

Aside from being a feat of engineering, the US$4.2
billion (€3.4 billion) railway is part of efforts to
develop China's poor, restive west and bind it more
closely to the booming east. Chinese leaders hope
greater prosperity will help to still calls by
Tibetans and other ethnic minorities for autonomy from
the communist Beijing government.

The line has prompted protests by activists who say it
will bring an influx of Chinese migrants to the
isolated Himalayan region, threatening its ecology and
diluting its unique Buddhist culture.

Trains completed shorter trips on the line between
Lhasa and Golmud while passengers on the 16-car train
from the Chinese capital were in the midst of their
journey.

State media gave heavy coverage to the railway, with
newspapers publishing front-page photos of passengers
singing and villagers waving to the passing train. The
state television midday news showed President Hu
Jintao congratulating workers who built the line.

Before the last leg of the trip to Lhasa, the train
stopped in Golmud early Monday to switch its standard
engine for three powerful locomotives required to haul
the train at high altitude.

Passengers included a 2 1/2-year-old boy, a
78-year-old man and a group of ethnic Tibetans newly
graduated from the Beijing Police Academy who were
headed home to work as police officers.

One Tibetan passenger asked a Western reporter what
the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader,
thought of the train. The man, who asked not to be
identified by name, said that with China's Internet
monitoring, it was too dangerous for him to search
news Web sites for the information himself.

The only signs of human habitation in the arid
highlands south of Golmud were traditional herders
tending yaks and small train stations that dot the
rail line.

After the train climbed above 4,000 meters (13,000
feet), ballpoint pens and bags of processed food burst
due to the low air pressure. Laptop computers and
digital music recorders failed, because moving parts
in their disc drives are cushioned by tiny air bags
that break at high altitude.

China's government says it is spending 1.5 billion
yuan (US$190 million; €150 million) on environmental
protection along the Golmud-Lhasa stretch of the
railway.

But despite promises to minimize pollution, the sides
of the line were littered with plastic bags, bottles
and cardboard boxes. Large sections of the permanently
frozen earth were grassless, puddled and scarred by
vehicle tracks. Damaged permafrost "becomes dark,
ugly, muddy water," said Daniel Wong, an engineer
based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen who
worked on the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, also laid
over permafrost. "The most unfortunate thing is that
such damage will spread," he said.

The railway is projected to help double tourism
revenues in Tibet by 2010 and cut transport costs for
goods by 75 percent. Until now, goods going to and
from Tibet have been trucked over mountain highways
that are often blocked by landslides or snow, making
trade prohibitively expensive.

New York-based Students for a Free Tibet set up a Web
site, rejecttherailway.com, urging the public to wear
black armbands in protest of the project, which the
group says "is a tool Beijing will use to overwhelm
(the) Tibetan population."

"We reject the railway just as we reject China's
illegitimate rule in Tibet," the site said.

Communist troops marched into Tibet in 1950, and
Beijing says the region has been Chinese territory for
centuries. But Tibet was effectively independent for
much of that time.

The rail line is a decades-old dream for Chinese
officials. But work began in earnest only in 2001,
after engineers worked out how to stabilize tracks on
permafrost.

The highest station is in Nagqu, a town at 4,500
meters (14,850 feet) in the plateau's rolling
grasslands.

By Joseph Kahn The New York Times

Published: June 30, 2006

BEIJING China this weekend is opening the world's
highest railway, a 1,140- kilometer line that crosses
the vertiginous Tibetan Plateau and forges a steel
bond with the once secluded Buddhist holy city of
Lhasa.

The railway, expected to be inaugurated by President
Hu Jintao and other top Communist Party cadres on a
deluxe opening run, is an engineering marvel that
traverses unstable permafrost and reaches more than
5,000 meters, or 16,500 feet, above sea level, higher
than France's Mont Blanc.

Party officials have hailed the $4.1 billion project,
which was decades in the making, as a milestone in its
efforts to develop its vast, poor western region and
bring a fresh infusion of people and prosperity to
remote Tibet.

But Tibetan and foreign critics say the railway
benefits Han Chinese, China's dominant ethnic group,
at the expense of Tibetan natives. They argue that
enhanced transportation links will accelerate a trend
of Han-led economic development and smother Tibet's
ancient spiritual culture, while undermining the
pristine natural environment of its highlands.

"The overwhelming opinion among Tibetans is that the
railway will consolidate Chinese control and bring in
huge numbers of Han Chinese," said Tenzin Tsundue, an
independent Tibetan writer and activist who lives in
India.

"It will mean less employment and more destruction for
Tibetans, not more opportunity," he said.

On Friday, three women from the United States, Canada
and Britain were detained briefly after they climbed
through a second-floor window at Beijing's main train
station and unfurled a black-and-white banner that
read, "China's Tibet Railway, Designed to Destroy."

Chinese officials defend the railway as vital to
stimulating Tibet's development. They project it will
double tourist revenues and reduce the cost of cargo
transport by up to three-fourths.

"The completion of the Qinghai-Tibet railway is a
significant piece of good news longed for by the
people in Qinghai Province and the Tibetan Autonomous
Region," Zhu Zhensheng, executive vice director of the
Qingzang Railway Office of the Chinese Railway
Administration, said in a news briefing this past
week. "The railway provides capacity for the quick
flow of people, goods and information" and will
directly contribute to the development of the area,
Zhu said.

Mao proposed extending a railway to Tibet after the
People's Liberation Army invaded the territory and
brought it firmly under Chinese control in 1951,
sending the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, into
exile.

The first section, extending from Beijing to Golmud in
Qinghai Province, was completed in 1984. But the
710-mile section connecting Golmud to Lhasa was put on
indefinite hold. It would have to cross the Tibetan
Plateau, survive extreme temperatures and stay fixed
in the shifting permafrost of the highlands.

The plan was revived in 2001, when it was promoted as
a key element of the Communist Party's "Go West"
campaign. Engineers decided that bridges could span
the most treacherous area of permafrost and that
naturally cooled piping sunk into the ground could
keep the tracks and embankment frozen to reduce
instability.

Bombardier of Canada supplied specially outfitted
train cars that supply oxygen, like aircraft, to
prevent sickness among passengers at high altitudes.

A direct Beijing-to-Lhasa luxury train will be
officially unveiled Saturday to coincide with the 85th
anniversary of the founding of the ruling Communist
Party. State media have been promoting the train for
weeks as a new feather in the cap of state engineers
who also celebrated the formal completion of the Three
Gorges Dam, the world's largest dam, this spring.

But the event is being tightly controlled by Chinese
officials to ensure favorable coverage. They
handpicked 40 foreign journalists to ride the first
train. Other news organizations, including The New
York Times, that purchased train tickets independently
were denied permits to enter Tibetan territory.

Even at the official price tag of $4.1 billion, the
railway is difficult to justify in economic terms.
Tibet's total gross domestic product in 2005 was $3.12
billion, so the payoff in terms of boosting economic
activity would appear to lie decades in the future if
it ever comes.

Also, foreign engineers who have been involved with
elements of the project, but asked not to be
identified because they did not wish to offend their
Chinese sponsors, say the railway will require heavy
expenditures on maintenance and may be difficult to
run for more than a decade without an extensive
overhaul.

Tibetan activists say they do not oppose the railway
in principle but argue that it was conceived mainly to
enhance China's economic and military control over the
Tibetan region.

Even as they promote the rail line, Chinese officials
still focus heavily on combating what they call
Tibetan separatism, especially the resilient loyalty
there to the Dalai Lama. Zhang Qingli, recently
appointed as the Communist Party's top official in
Tibet, told party leaders there in May that they were
engaged in "a fight to the death" against the Dalai
Lama, Tibet Daily reported.

it ever comes.

Also, foreign engineers who have been involved with
elements of the project, but asked not to be
identified because they did not wish to offend their
Chinese sponsors, say the railway will require heavy
expenditures on maintenance and may be difficult to
run for more than a decade without an extensive
overhaul.

Tibetan activists say they do not oppose the railway
in principle but argue that it was conceived mainly to
enhance China's economic and military control over the
Tibetan region.

Even as they promote the rail line, Chinese officials
still focus heavily on combating what they call
Tibetan separatism, especially the resilient loyalty
there to the Dalai Lama. Zhang Qingli, recently
appointed as the Communist Party's top official in
Tibet, told party leaders there in May that they were
engaged in "a fight to the death" against the Dalai
Lama, Tibet Daily reported.

 BEIJING China this weekend is opening the world's
highest railway, a 1,140- kilometer line that crosses
the vertiginous Tibetan Plateau and forges a steel
bond with the once secluded Buddhist holy city of
Lhasa.

The railway, expected to be inaugurated by President
Hu Jintao and other top Communist Party cadres on a
deluxe opening run, is an engineering marvel that
traverses unstable permafrost and reaches more than
5,000 meters, or 16,500 feet, above sea level, higher
than France's Mont Blanc.

Party officials have hailed the $4.1 billion project,
which was decades in the making, as a milestone in its
efforts to develop its vast, poor western region and
bring a fresh infusion of people and prosperity to
remote Tibet.

But Tibetan and foreign critics say the railway
benefits Han Chinese, China's dominant ethnic group,
at the expense of Tibetan natives. They argue that
enhanced transportation links will accelerate a trend
of Han-led economic development and smother Tibet's
ancient spiritual culture, while undermining the
pristine natural environment of its highlands.

"The overwhelming opinion among Tibetans is that the
railway will consolidate Chinese control and bring in
huge numbers of Han Chinese," said Tenzin Tsundue, an
independent Tibetan writer and activist who lives in
India.

"It will mean less employment and more destruction for
Tibetans, not more opportunity," he said.

On Friday, three women from the United States, Canada
and Britain were detained briefly after they climbed
through a second-floor window at Beijing's main train
station and unfurled a black-and-white banner that
read, "China's Tibet Railway, Designed to Destroy."

Chinese officials defend the railway as vital to
stimulating Tibet's development. They project it will
double tourist revenues and reduce the cost of cargo
transport by up to three-fourths.

"The completion of the Qinghai-Tibet railway is a
significant piece of good news longed for by the
people in Qinghai Province and the Tibetan Autonomous
Region," Zhu Zhensheng, executive vice director of the
Qingzang Railway Office of the Chinese Railway
Administration, said in a news briefing this past
week. "The railway provides capacity for the quick
flow of people, goods and information" and will
directly contribute to the development of the area,
Zhu said.

Mao proposed extending a railway to Tibet after the
People's Liberation Army invaded the territory and
brought it firmly under Chinese control in 1951,
sending the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, into
exile.

The first section, extending from Beijing to Golmud in
Qinghai Province, was completed in 1984. But the
710-mile section connecting Golmud to Lhasa was put on
indefinite hold. It would have to cross the Tibetan
Plateau, survive extreme temperatures and stay fixed
in the shifting permafrost of the highlands.

The plan was revived in 2001, when it was promoted as
a key element of the Communist Party's "Go West"
campaign. Engineers decided that bridges could span
the most treacherous area of permafrost and that
naturally cooled piping sunk into the ground could
keep the tracks and embankment frozen to reduce
instability.

Bombardier of Canada supplied specially outfitted
train cars that supply oxygen, like aircraft, to
prevent sickness among passengers at high altitudes.

A direct Beijing-to-Lhasa luxury train will be
officially unveiled Saturday to coincide with the 85th
anniversary of the founding of the ruling Communist
Party. State media have been promoting the train for
weeks as a new feather in the cap of state engineers
who also celebrated the formal completion of the Three
Gorges Dam, the world's largest dam, this spring.

But the event is being tightly controlled by Chinese
officials to ensure favorable coverage. They
handpicked 40 foreign journalists to ride the first
train. Other news organizations, including The New
York Times, that purchased train tickets independently
were denied permits to enter Tibetan territory.

Even at the official price tag of $4.1 billion, the
railway is difficult to justify in economic terms.
Tibet's total gross domestic product in 2005 was $3.12
billion, so the payoff in terms of boosting economic
activity would appear to lie decades in the future if
it ever comes.

Also, foreign engineers who have been involved with
elements of the project, but asked not to be
identified because they did not wish to offend their
Chinese sponsors, say the railway will require heavy
expenditures on maintenance and may be difficult to
run for more than a decade without an extensive
overhaul.

A difference. A subject that often causes me to marvel. It has always seemed
to me that the brilliance of Pound's prosody lay in the use of assonance to
establish properties of vowel duration, building from there his layered
forms and the suggestion that musical values, in some primary sense, have
inherent, architectonic measures. When he employs a prosody derived from
accentual meters like the border ballads that have had such a strong
influence on American poetry and song, say, in the Confucian Odes, it simply
seems bad Robert Burns.



As this thread suggests Langston Hughes prosody is of a different order,
possibly related to blues. Allowing for some effects of syncopation, what I
think we often find in Hughes, among other forms of visualizing the line
(clearly he also often imitates Sandburg or Whitman, gospel as well as
blues), is song of the sweetest and clearest expressive order. It is lines
like these that intrigue me, from "Restrictive Covenants":



When I move

Into a neighborhood

Folks fly.



Even every foreigner

That can move, moves.



Why?



Crowded accentuation, "folks fly."

Echo and variation, use of rhyme, reflecting the simple common speech
expressions.

The assonance of all the /o/s of  "move" and "moves."



Political and perhaps timely meanings, but also a language of genuine
bemusement, ironic maybe, innocent too in the way it essentializes shared
human-ness.



What I am trying to say in response to this thread is that everywhere in
Hughes from start to finish, you will find examples of song working to
highly expressive effect. You will not find imitation so much as invention,
music that clarifies feeling; music drawing on multiple traditions, often
with traces of apprehendible folk sources.



Maybe there is a bases here for a continued discussion of prosody, musical
phrase and speech patterns.

Kathy Acker, the novelist and theorist, died from breast cancer in
1997.  Her papers are at Duke, but her clothes and accessories remain
in the possession of her executor Matias Viegener.  I will display a
selection of Kathy Acker's clothes during my 5-day residency at New
Langton Arts, and on Wednesday, July 12 at 7:00 I will give a
presentation, "Digging Through Kathy Acker's Stuff."  Last February
while visiting Viegener in Los Angeles, I rummaged through Acker's
extravagant designer wardrobe, and wheedled one of her Gautier
dresses from him, and a couple pieces of jewelry.  Possessing such
intimate effects of a woman I wasn't so much friends with as in awe
of, I felt compelled to write it all out.  I meditate upon relics,
ghosts, compulsive shopping, archives, make-up, our drive to
mythologize the dead, Acker's own self-mythologizing, the struggle

Five Habitats: Squatting at Langton
Tuesday July 11 - Saturday August 12

Opening Reception: Tuesday, July 11, 7-10 pm

Reading by Dodie Bellamy: Wednesday, July 12, 7 pm

Admission: $8/$5 Members, students, and seniors
New Langton Arts
1246 Folsom Street
San Francisco, CA 94103-3817
For further information: 415.626.5416

Five Habitats: Squatting at Langton is a laboratory-style,
experiential exhibition modeled after Jock Reynolds' 1978 show Five
Habitats for Five Members at Langton's original location, 80 Langton
Street. In 2006, Langton challenges artist curators John Baldessari,
Keith Boadwee, Matthew Higgs, Joseph del Pesco, and Anne Walsh to each
invite five artists working across disciplines for one-week intervals
to occupy and activate the gallery space. Korean-born architect Kyu
Che designed five habitats in the gallery to be transformed by the
artists into open studios, exhibition spaces, lounges, working
stations, discussion forums, screening venues, performance settings,
and more.

Week One: July 11 - 15
Curator: Matthew Higgs
Artists: Dodie Bellamy, Chris Cobb, Alexis Georgopoulos, Kevin
Killian, and Mitzi Pederson.

Kathy Acker, the novelist and theorist, died from breast cancer in
1997. Her papers are at Duke, but her clothes and accessories remain
in the possession of her executor, Matias Viegener. Dodie Bellamy will
display a selection of Kathy Acker's clothes during her residency at
New Langton Arts, and on Wednesday, July 12 she will give a
presentation, "Digging Through Kathy Acker's Stuff."

During his one-week residency at Langton, Chris Cobb creates a lounge
area to listen to the music of Devendra Banhart and the Hairy Fairy
Band . Cobb, a big fan of Devendra's "freak funk" music, proposes a
space that welcomes visitors to listen to the band's albums. It also
includes a large number of photographs of them--both in concert and
back stage--taken by Cobb.

Musician, composer and artist Alexis Georgopoulos presents ARP ,
occupying the smallest space Kyu Che designed for the exhibition. As
such, Georgopoulos has chosen the intimate idea of getting together
with a friend or acquaintance to share a cup of tea, to take a moment,
to slow down, and perhaps, reflect. Georgopoulos places a table, a tea
set for two, and two speakers in the space. In this intimate, almost
cocoon-like setting, the music Georgopoulos has composed as ARP will
play as a backdrop.

San Francisco writer Kevin Killian re-stages an exhibition presented
earlier this Spring at White Columns, New York, Other People's
Projects: Dodie Bellamy and Kevin Killian . At White Columns Killian
and Bellamy presented a complete run of their pioneering literary
'zine "Mirage/Period(ical)" alongside contributions from some of the
artists and writers who have appeared on its pages. At Langton Killian
will display 132 issues of the zine, and artworks by a variety of
local and international artists.

Mitzi Pederson creates a new installation that explores ideas of
tension, gravity, and systems interconnectivity. Pederson uses the
"subterranean space", which is transformed into a private
de-orchestrated piece, where the presence and movements of multiple
bodies determines the effects on the space, ranging from calm
qualities to periodic audible and visual disruptions.

Hi.  I'm a member of LA Art Girls, and we just has a fashion show at LACE
here in LA.  We made a pamphlet, and I can .pdf you a copy (designed to be
printed out landscape, double sided) if you'd like.  Just request one at
cadaly at comcast dot net

It was right before my sister's wedding (yes it was great), and so I was
unable to realize my plan to veil the audience.

All best,
Catherine Daly

very much appreciate it. there are only 3 libraries in the OCLC system (north america and
europe) that have this
title and none are willing/able to interlibrary loan it.

It has been argued that modernism ended with the Atomic Bomb being dropped
on Hiroshima or Auschwitz take your pick and that Postmodernism begins a
that time which fits rather well since Olson coined the term in the 1950's .


It has also been argued by Visual Art critics that Postmodernism began to
wane with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. No new term has been coined
for what has been going on since that time. I for one would argue that we
are still in a Postmodern period but I think this is key we are also in a
Neo-Liberal period which has supplanted Leftist ideologies everywhere except
in Latin America of late. So how do we reconcile Postmodernism with the fact
that most of the world, US, China, India, most of Europe and Japan (About
80% of the global economy) has become Neo Liberal
("conservative" in American Parlance)?

I would argue that the end of Marxism as a political system in the 1990's
left a void that no one has filled with new ideas and this is the main
reason we have these Postmodernist arguments. Until the global discussion on
the left in Art, Literature, Politics and Economics coalesces into some sort
of alternative vision it will remain fractured and sidelined and we will
continue to have wars and Ted Kooser as US Poet Laureate.

Subject: another shot at post modernism

I am a little puzzled by those who would deny that there is a thing that can
be rightly called post modernism.

I think that the recent witty banter about Bernstein & Silliman, or Woody
Allen & Altman, presumes that there is in fact a significant difference
here, and for people like Alex Saliby who want to get a handle on these
terms, these denials don't seem helpful.

Of course, I agree with Mark Weiss & others who have suggested that the term
post modernism is too broad and over-used.  But, though I am a Sanskritist
with my head buried in remote Vedic antiquity, I happen to be surrounded by
artists in my family, and I have for some strange reason been teaching at an
art school for the past dozen years or so.
As such, I have no doubt that there is a post modernism that we should
acknowledge, as such.

I am convinced that most of us have come to have certain reservations about
modernism.  To the extent that we do, we are all post modern.  I think that
all of us who are feminists are post modern.  I think that all of us who
identify ourselves as ethnic are post modern.  I think that all of us who
identify ourselves as gay are post modern.  I think that all of us who are
drawn to non-European arts & cultures are post modern as well.  Actually, I
think that all of us are post modern, whether we know it or not.

I mentioned McEvilley earlier.  He was involved in a famous debate in the
80's concerning a well-known show at MOMA, "Primitivism" in Twentieth
Century Art: Affinity of the Tribal and the Modern. Many of you are familiar
with this, I'm sure.  He was an editor at Artforum at the time, and he was
one of the people who led the charge against MOMA modernism.  I use the
exchange between him and the curators of the MOMA show to introduce students
to post modernism.

My students almost totally self-identify as post modernist in response to
this debate between McEvilley and the curators of this show, well-known and
influential people like William Rubin and Kirk Varnedoe, guardians of the
modernist church of art., both now dead

And then we turn to film history.  Even the slowest students recognize that
when we turn to recent films we have entered into a landscape that is no
longer modernist.

One example:  Chris Nolan's "Memento." They love it.  Their parents hate it.

George, Ray,=20
Thanks for your thoughts and insight, or should that be incite? =20
Alex
P.S.=20
I have an entirely different view now that I've read even more in my =
attempts at justifying the label, Postmodernism.  I believe the problem =
is not that there are not differences among a host of players but rather =
that the label fails to assist in identifying any of the reasons for the =
differences: arts, engineering, architecture, literature (and here I =
differentiate prose from poetry because as I examine elements, I see a =
time difference between the two in when an ideological shift ocurred) =
and indeed music, dance and the live theater all took off in new =
directions.  However, for me, the problem lies with the labels =
themselves.  The names are useless as descriptors of any ideology that =
may have predominated during a score or more of years for whatever =
reasons: Moderns, Post Moderns, who ever the hell they are, or whenever =
in time the differences originated.

These words, Modernists & Postmodernists, in point of fact, are =
meaningless for several reasons; they are words of far too common use =
with far too widely used denotative and connotative meanings to be =
narrowed to the level of title of an era or a movement in any meaningful =
sense.  And the identity problem is exacerbated by the horrendous =
difficulty of sorting through the complex maze of ideas that found their =
way into open expression from the turn of the century upward throughout =
the middle half of the century. =20

I abandoned my efforts at understanding any philosophical and practical =
creative differences for that which is labeled "Post Modern," and I've =
embarked upon a totally different mission.  I've begun a search for a =
more meaningful label. =20

My thought is that if I can assemble a sort of matrix of mayhem I can =
place certain "creators" into various boxes under 'to come' headings in =
the matrix. =20

I may end my efforts in total frustration=20

The issue is not that creativity didn't take some drastically different =
turns in many areas (some areas long before others), the issue is simply =
those who coined the name for the changes failed to be descriptive of =
any differences and focused on the simple element of time...Modern, =
Post-modern.  Wow that must have burned lots of intellectual BTU's. (any =
idea who we should blame for that name?  Was it Olson?  How =
disappointing; I thought more highly of him than that).

I may fail in my efforts to label more accurately...perhaps definitively =
is a better word than accurately, but if I do, nothing will have been =
lost, and who knows, I may succeed in sticking some names into some =
pigeon holes that actually make more ideological and thematic sense than =
the over-generalized and sloppily applied term of Postmodernist. =20

And of course, I'm open and willing to receive any labels you all may =
offer.

  It has been argued that modernism ended with the Atomic Bomb being =
dropped
  on Hiroshima or Auschwitz take your pick and that Postmodernism begins =
a
  that time which fits rather well since Olson coined the term in the =
1950's .


  It has also been argued by Visual Art critics that Postmodernism began =
to
  wane with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. No new term has been =
coined
  for what has been going on since that time. I for one would argue that =
we
  are still in a Postmodern period but I think this is key we are also =
in a
  Neo-Liberal period which has supplanted Leftist ideologies everywhere =
except
  in Latin America of late. So how do we reconcile Postmodernism with =
the fact
  that most of the world, US, China, India, most of Europe and Japan =
(About
  80% of the global economy) has become Neo Liberal
  ("conservative" in American Parlance)?=20

  I would argue that the end of Marxism as a political system in the =
1990's
  left a void that no one has filled with new ideas and this is the main
  reason we have these Postmodernist arguments. Until the global =
discussion on
  the left in Art, Literature, Politics and Economics coalesces into =
some sort
  of alternative vision it will remain fractured and sidelined and we =
will
  continue to have wars and Ted Kooser as US Poet Laureate.=20

  Subject: another shot at post modernism

  I am a little puzzled by those who would deny that there is a thing =
that can
  be rightly called post modernism.

  I think that the recent witty banter about Bernstein & Silliman, or =
Woody
  Allen & Altman, presumes that there is in fact a significant =
difference
  here, and for people like Alex Saliby who want to get a handle on =
these
  terms, these denials don't seem helpful.

  Of course, I agree with Mark Weiss & others who have suggested that =
the term
  post modernism is too broad and over-used.  But, though I am a =
Sanskritist
  with my head buried in remote Vedic antiquity, I happen to be =
surrounded by
  artists in my family, and I have for some strange reason been teaching =
at an
  art school for the past dozen years or so. =20
  As such, I have no doubt that there is a post modernism that we should
  acknowledge, as such.

  I am convinced that most of us have come to have certain reservations =
about
  modernism.  To the extent that we do, we are all post modern.  I think =
that
  all of us who are feminists are post modern.  I think that all of us =
who
  identify ourselves as ethnic are post modern.  I think that all of us =
who
  identify ourselves as gay are post modern.  I think that all of us who =
are
  drawn to non-European arts & cultures are post modern as well.  =
Actually, I
  think that all of us are post modern, whether we know it or not.

  I mentioned McEvilley earlier.  He was involved in a famous debate in =
the
  80's concerning a well-known show at MOMA, "Primitivism" in Twentieth
  Century Art: Affinity of the Tribal and the Modern. Many of you are =
familiar
  with this, I'm sure.  He was an editor at Artforum at the time, and he =
was
  one of the people who led the charge against MOMA modernism.  I use =
the
  exchange between him and the curators of the MOMA show to introduce =
students
  to post modernism.

  My students almost totally self-identify as post modernist in response =
to
  this debate between McEvilley and the curators of this show, =
well-known and
  influential people like William Rubin and Kirk Varnedoe, guardians of =
the
  modernist church of art., both now dead

  And then we turn to film history.  Even the slowest students recognize =
that
  when we turn to recent films we have entered into a landscape that is =
no
  longer modernist.

  One example:  Chris Nolan's "Memento." They love it.  Their parents =
hate it.

daily massacres against Palestinians. "Each young man watches what is

The Palestinian left must highlight politically the value of this kind
of resistance operation, and counter-pose it politically to terrorist
operations directed at random Israeli civilians. The latter type of
operation demoralizes the oppressed Palestinians, reinforces Zionismâ€™s

srael kicked off the world cup by killing an entire family in Gaza, and
it hasn't taken a break in its systematic bombardment and assassination
of Palestinians since the beginning of the season....To turn against the
Palestinian government on the grounds that it should make concessions,
such as recognising Israel, in exchange for food is a dangerous trend.
Europe has promised to lift the blockade if such concessions are
forthcoming, but they haven't promised to secure reciprocal concessions
from Israel. To reproach the Palestinian government, instead of standing
with it in a unified front against the blockade, is tantamount to

It is imperative that we DEMAND in no uncertain terms that the Canadian

The political beheading of the Palestinians is seen as one precondition
for Israel unilaterally dictating its borders. The aim is to end any
possibility of organized opposition to Olmertâ€™s plan to annex 45 percent
of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem....Only a unified struggle by
Arab and Jewish workers on the basis of a socialist program offers a
means of defeating the machinations of Washington and Tel Aviv and
averting a catastrophe. All those in Israel seeking to oppose further
bloodshed must break with Jewish nationalism and reject the Zionist
state. The suffering of the Palestinian people and the impasse facing
Israeli workers demands the forging of a revolutionary movement of the
working class and the oppressed masses to end imperialist domination and
capitalist exploitation,... -- Chris Marsden -- "Israeli assault on Gaza

Vladimir Putin is, right now, taking questions
on BBC World, and one can still submit questions
to the BBC World website.

My question is this, "When G. W. Bush looked
into your eyes and saw your soul, what did you
see in his?"

My guess is that Putin is diplomatic enough not
to answer.

When Bush was in Russia to observe and critique that country's  "progress"
towards (American/Bush -style) "democracy" he confronted Putin with its
failures in Russia.
     Putin remarked this was interesting coming from a President not
democratically elected, but chosen by a court.

Dear Poetics People,

July is upon us with all of its revolutionary milestones: the 4th,
the 14th, and now the 10th. This MONDAY [note, MONDAY, not
Wednesday] July 10th at 7pm, Vacation House will be featuring two
immensely talented poets who's work far outshines gaudy
multi-million dollar fireworks displays. The reading is, as per
usual, at McNally Robinson Books <www.mcnallyrobinsonnyc.com/> and
will probably be the only event you attend in the next two weeks
which you can enjoy without the aid of a half raw hamburger.

SARAH MANGUSO is the author of two poetry collections, *Siste
Viator* and *The Captain Lands in Paradise.* Her first story
collection, *Hard to Admit and Harder to Escape,* is forthcoming
from McSweeney's Books in 2007. She teaches at the Pratt Institute
and lives in Brooklyn.

PAUL VIOLI's eleventh book of poems, *Overnight*, will be published
this winter. He is the recipient of the Zabel Award from the
American Academy of Arts and Letters and numerous other poetry
awards. He teaches at Columbia and in the MFA program at New
School.

Hope to see you there

The mother of one of the martyrs killed in the operation on the Israeli
military post said that her son took part in this after seeing Israel's
daily massacres against Palestinians. "Each young man watches what is
going on and what is happening to his people. So when you can offer your
people something that could raise their morale and preserve their
dignity it's illogical that you don't act." -- "Palestinian Resistance
captures Israeli soldier and shoot dead two others"


The Palestinian left must highlight politically the value of this kind
of resistance operation, and counter-pose it politically to terrorist
operations directed at random Israeli civilians. The latter type of
operation demoralizes the oppressed Palestinians, reinforces Zionismâ€™s
hold on the Israelis, and (in the words of the ANCâ€™s Oliver Tambo)

to defend their freedom and independence," Sayyed Mohammad Hussein

and

srael kicked off the world cup by killing an entire family in Gaza, and
it hasn't taken a break in its systematic bombardment and assassination
of Palestinians since the beginning of the season....To turn against the
Palestinian government on the grounds that it should make concessions,
such as recognising Israel, in exchange for food is a dangerous trend.
Europe has promised to lift the blockade if such concessions are
forthcoming, but they haven't promised to secure reciprocal concessions
from Israel. To reproach the Palestinian government, instead of standing
with it in a unified front against the blockade, is tantamount to
raising a white flag. To maintain that the Palestinians have to reach an
agreement with Israel before the latter forges ahead with its own plans
is to capitulate to those plans. -- Azmi Bishara -- "The poisoned
chalice: Israel kicked off the world cup by killing an entire family in

and


It is imperative that we DEMAND in no uncertain terms that the Canadian
Government send the much-vaunted "DART" water generating teams to Gaza
IMMEDIATELY. DART's job is to help people in time of disaster and this
is one - although man-made - it is no less deserving of help.

This is a devastating interview with Mohammed Omer who lives in Rafah,
Palestine and writes a blog called Rafah Today

and

The political beheading of the Palestinians is seen as one precondition
for Israel unilaterally dictating its borders. The aim is to end any
possibility of organized opposition to Olmertâ€™s plan to annex 45 percent
of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem....Only a unified struggle by
Arab and Jewish workers on the basis of a socialist program offers a
means of defeating the machinations of Washington and Tel Aviv and
averting a catastrophe. All those in Israel seeking to oppose further
bloodshed must break with Jewish nationalism and reject the Zionist
state. The suffering of the Palestinian people and the impasse facing
Israeli workers demands the forging of a revolutionary movement of the
working class and the oppressed masses to end imperialist domination and
capitalist exploitation,... -- Chris Marsden -- "Israeli assault on Gaza

hostages held by Israel are released,... what all Israelis have to
realize is that the age of colonialism has ended." -- Ali Abunimah

greetings,

a reminder about the debut of this new series tomorrow.

as ever,
david

p.s. one more event missive forthcoming.
apologies for doubling up today.

----------------

Garden Party
with Olive Juice Music
and Boog City

Sat. July 8, 2:00 p.m., free

a summer series, in the
Suffolk Street Community Garden
Suffolk St., bet. Houston & Stanton sts.
NYC

readings from=20
Joanna Fuhrman and Tanya Larkin

music from=20
Lisa Lilund and Major Matt Mason USA

Curated and with introductions by
Boog City editor and publisher David Kirschenbaum and
Olive Juice Music head Matt Roth

---------

**Boog City is a New York City-based small press now in its 15th year and
East Village community newspaper of the same name. It has also published 35
volumes of poetry and various magazines, featuring work by Allen Ginsberg
and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, and theme issues on baseball,
women=B9s writing, and Louisville, KY. It  hosts and curates two regular
performance series--d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press, where
each month a non-NYC small press and its writers and a musical act of their
choosing is hosted at Chelsea's ACA Galleries; and Classic Albums Live,
where 5-13 local musical acts perform a classic album live at venues
including The Bowery Poetry Club, CBGB's, and The Knitting Factory. Past
albums have included Elvis Costello, My Aim is True; Nirvana, Nevermind; an=
d
Liz Phair, Exile in Guyville.

**Olive Juice Music is a D.I.Y. label, studio, and mail-order distributor
based in New York City and interested in helping people who are in the
developmental stages of trying to do something with their art. Olive Juice
Music is not a traditional record label. The artists associated with Olive
Juice take an active part in how their music is produced, financed, and
marketed. They in turn receive more of the profits gained from the sales of
their records directly, which is how it should be. The strength of Olive
Juice relies upon the active participation of its members to share resource=
s
and help promote a communal spirit among everyone involved as well as
claiming responsibility for taking their art to wherever they would like it
to go.

**Joanna Fuhrman is the author of three collections of poetry published by
Hanging Loose Press, Freud in Brooklyn (2000), Ugh Ugh Ocean (2003), and
Moraine (2006). Her last book was described in Publishers Weekly as an
"exciting mishmash of insights, associations, charms, jokes and biting
social commentary, well positioned somewhere in the nifty triangle formed b=
y
Frank O'Hara, Ted Berrigan and the Shins." Her poems written with others ar=
e
forthcoming in Saints of Hysteria: Fifty Years of Collaborative Poetry (Sof=
t
Skull Press). She teaches poetry in the public schools.

**Tanya Larkin is poet and fiction writer living in Somerville, Mass. She
teaches English at the New England Institute of Art. She is a 2004 recipien=
t
of a Massachusetts Cultural Council Grant. Her most recent poems have
appeared in The Hat, Xantippe, and The Zoland Press Poetry Anthology.

**Lisa Li-Lund hails from Paris, France and writes songs on piano and
guitar. Her record "Lisa Li-Lund Ran away" was just released on Smoking Gun
Records (UK).=20

**Major Matt Mason USA has been making music since the late =B980s. In his
father's basement in Shawnee, Kansas (a suburb of Kansas City) Matt would
amuse his dog Friskie by lip-synching to Kiss records and hammering out
ditties about the threat of nuclear war and peer pressure on a $30 Harmony
guitar. While attending the University of Kansas, Matt got his first taste
of a thriving underground music scene playing guitar for local punk bands
with names like Magic Nose and Dracomagnet that drew from influences
including the Butthole Surfers and Jesus Lizard.

In the early =B990s, Matt localized a five-year long distance relationship an=
d
moved to New York City where he found a home in the now infamous East
Village Antifolk Community. The weekly Antihoots at the Sidewalk Cafe
provided Matt with a chance to vent about the high cost of living in New
York and the rapid deterioration of the relationship he just moved across
the country for. After a brief stint as a record store clerk, he landed a
job as an apprentice at a soho based commercial sound facility. For the nex=
t
five years he would spend his days in a state-of-the-art digital audio
facility servicing high profile advertising clients, while his nights were
spent plucking out edgy lo-fi acoustic love songs into a boombox in a mouse=
-
infested lower east side apartment.

Flash forward 5 years. Major Matt has evolved from the boombox to a catalog
of 4 full-length albums filled with influences that range from Bob Dylan to
Sonic Youth. He has established Olive Juice Music--a fully functional
recording studio/independent record label/online distribution center that h=
e
operates out of his NYC apartment with bandmate/significant other Nan Turne=
r
and cat Gummo (who takes care of the mice). Matt is also a member of the
bands Schwervon! and Kansas State Flower. The DIY spirit is a big part of
Matt's art and lifestyle as he continues to carve out a niche for truly
modern American Folk music.

*About The Wandering Hermit Review*

The Wandering Hermit Review is a digest size, perfect-bound journal of
150-200 pages that comes out annually. In the spirit of d. a. levy, the
Hermit is a 100% d.i.y. mag printed via home computer/laser printer and
bound by hand in the editor's kitchen using plywood and spring clamps. We'r=
e
happy to report that people often don't believe that when they first see th=
e
mag which looks pretty slick, if we do say so ourselves. The Wandering
Hermit features an eclectic blend of writing and visual art ranging from th=
e
wildly experimental to the fairly traditional. We love finding common
elements in the work of writers coming from radically different aesthetic
backgrounds and enjoy placing them side-by-side.

West Philly, from August 15th until September 10th or so. If anyone
knows of a situation please backchannel.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

here's a curious video:

http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5832390545689805144&q=american+revol
ution

this is "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised", a sort of documentary about
the failed 2002 coup attempt against the Venezuelan government of Hugo
Chavez.

the video 'reads' a bit like Venezuelan propaganda, though it was apparently
directed and produced by Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brian, whom i think are
Irish.

which is to say i don't think it *is* Venezuelan propaganda, but there is
very little balance in tracing the nature of the conflict.

that said, it's the first extended video i've seen on the failed coup
attempt, and it is fascinating to see how it unfolded, or how it unfolds
from the perspective Bartley and O'Brian create, which clearly is not
without more than a few grains of truth. what we get is a very pro-Chavez
perspective on the failed coup.

i think they could have really strengthened their video by making it less
thoroughly partisan. as it is, one comes away looking for something with
more balance.

still, the coup would have succeeded were it not for strong popular support
for Chavez. and, of course, it might have succeeded were the conspirators
more ruthless and have murdered him--though the strength of the popular
support for Chavez would have made such a move very difficult to follow
except with a more harshly repressive regime than perhaps they really wanted
to undertake.

the key bone of contention has been the nationalizing of the oil industry in
Venezuela, which is the third or fourth largest oil-producing nation in the
world. This move has been of course extrordinarily unpopular with the USA
government and within Venezuela itself among many. But with that much
wealth, there are far too many poor people in Venezuela, Chavez recognizes
this, and is trying to do something about it. And for that reason, I think
he has to be viewed as genuinely progressive in a society where the
distribution of wealth and education has not been just at all. Whether he
can actually create a better situation apparently remains to be seen, but I
wish him luck.

does anyone know of any good books or videos on this matter?

ja

ps: interesting the context: google video on the net. not something you're
likely to see on nbc. i looked through the google video. this one seems to
be the only interesting thing in all the header info i looked at. also, a
curious title ('the revolution will not be televised') given the crucial
nature of tv in the process as depicted in the video.

the video was aired several times on BBC4 in 2005 and i saw it a couple
of times then
the film-makers were in Venezuela making a documentary about Chavez
when they were caught up in first-hand wtness of the events as they
unfolded

they talk about this openly in the film  -  they do provide background
as to their intentions and they provide contextual perspectives

clearly they don't say as much as you would like Jim, but they didn't
set out to offer what you want so . . .  --  it's like i've read
critiques of United 93 saying it was weaker for not providing back
narratives for passengers on the plane (omg - yawn, the great thing
about that movie is that it is just like getting on a plane with a load
of people that you don't know) - - - anyway the film is terrific!!

i'd urge everyone to watch it

thanks for passing on its presence as a stream on google Jim  -- and
interesting that it appears under a search on American Revolution

The tile of the film is from the famous lyrics written by Gil Scott-Heron
performed as i recall by the Last Poets.

The video has been shown many times here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, usa--we
may be havng a sister city in Venezuela --and the Bolivarian government has
offered to open a program here of free eye care and operations for low
income people.  A Bolivarian Circle meets at least once a month and there
are frequent public events and showings of videos, speechs etc by various
representatives of the Bolivarian government.  I have a free DVD of "The
Revolution Will Not Be Televised"  given out as one of two choices at a
recent talk by the Consul at Conuslate in Chicago here in Milwaukee--along
with showing of several DVDs on the eye program and other program inside
Venezuela.   The Ambassador of Venezuela has visited a number of the cities
of the Upper Midwest with high poverty rates--Milwaukee, Detroit, etc. There
has also been discussion of low income fuel aid for Milwaukeeans offered by
the Bolivarian government. There is also an exchange program being opened up
for Milwaukeeans to go live and study and learn in Venezuela firsthand about
what is happening there.
     I've found it very fascinating--unusual-- and moving actually that the
Bolivarians have taken such an interest in Milwaukee and chosen it to be a
place to open up to.  It's going to be very interesting to see how al this
develops--hopefully all for the very best for everyone.

Unlike Cris I never saw it on BBC4 so for me it was a bit of an
eye-opener, even given the pro-Chavez slant, which I do not take as a
bad thing per se. In such situations it's hard to have "balance" I
think, and the film-makers do the right thing in terms of context as
Cris says, with whom I agree whole-heartedly in this instance. Indeed,
given the amount of anti-Chavez rhetoric coming from the north at that
time e.g http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/08/23/robertson.chavez/, I came
away with the feeling that the film-makers were relatively restrained
under the circumstances.

The revolution will not make you look five pounds
thinner, because the revolution will not be televised, Brother.

There will be no pictures of you and Willie May
pushing that shopping cart down the block on the dead run,
or trying to slide that color television into a stolen ambulance.
NBC will not be able predict the winner at 8:32
or report from 29 districts.

The theme song will not be written by Jim Webb,

The revolution will not fight the germs that may cause bad breath.
The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.

The revolution will not be televised, will not be televised,

The revolution will be no re-run brothers;

B-Movie:

  Well, the first thing I want to say is??Mandate my ass!?

Because it seems as though we've been convinced that 26% of the registere=
d voters, not even 26% of the American people, but 26% of the registered =
voters form a mandate ? or a landslide. 21% voted for Skippy and 3, 4% vo=
ted for somebody else who might have been running.

But, oh yeah, I remember. In this year that we have now declared the year=
 from Shogun to Reagan, I remember what I said about Reagan?meant it. Act=
ed like an actor?Hollyweird. Acted like a liberal. Acted like General Fra=
nco when he acted like governor of California, then he acted like a repub=
lican. Then he acted like somebody was going to vote for him for presiden=
t. And now we act like 26% of the registered voters is actually a mandate=
. We're all actors in this I suppose.

What has happened is that in the last 20 years, America has changed from =
a producer to a consumer. And all consumers know that when the producer n=
ames the tune?the consumer has got to dance. That's the way it is. We use=
d to be a producer ? very inflexible at that, and now we are consumers an=
d, finding it difficult to understand. Natural resources and minerals wil=
l change your world. The Arabs used to be in the 3rd World. They have bou=
ght the 2nd World and put a firm down payment on the 1st one. Controlling=
 your resources we'll control your world. This country has been surprised=
 by the way the world looks now. They don't know if they want to be Matt =
Dillon or Bob Dylan. They don't know if they want to be diplomats or cont=
inue the same policy - of nuclear nightmare diplomacy. John Foster Dulles=
 ain't nothing but the name of an airport now.

The idea concerns the fact that this country wants nostalgia. They want t=
o go back as far as they can ? even if it's only as far as last week. Not=
 to face now or tomorrow, but to face backwards. And yesterday was the da=
y of our cinema heroes riding to the rescue at the last possible moment. =
The day of the man in the white hat or the man on the white horse - or th=
e man who always came to save America at the last moment ? someone always=
 came to save America at the last moment ? especially in ?B? movies. And =
when America found itself having a hard time facing the future, they look=
ed for people like John Wayne. But since John Wayne was no longer availab=
le, they settled for Ronald Reagan ? and it has placed us in a situation =
that we can only look at ? like a ?B? movie.

Come with us back to those inglorious days when heroes weren't zeros. Bef=
ore fair was square. When the cavalry came straight away and all-American=
 men were like Hemingway to the days of the wondrous ?B? movie. The produ=
cer underwritten by all the millionaires necessary will be Casper ?The De=
fensive? Weinberger ? no more animated choice is available. The director =
will be Attila the Haig, running around frantically declaring himself in =
control and in charge. The ultimate realization of the inmates taking ove=
r at the asylum. The screenplay will be adapted from the book called ?Voo=
doo Economics? by George ?Papa Doc? Bush. Music by the ?Village People? t=
he very military "Macho Man."

?Company!!!?
?Macho, macho man!?
? Two-three-four.?
? He likes to be ? well, you get the point.?
?Huuut! Your left! Your left! Your left?right, left, right, left, right?!=
?

A theme song for saber-rallying and selling wars door-to-door. Remember, =
we're looking for the closest thing we can find to John Wayne. Clich?s ab=
ound like kangaroos ? courtesy of some spaced out Marlin Perkins, a Reaga=
n contemporary. Clich?s like, ?itchy trigger finger? and ?tall in the sad=
dle? and ?riding off or on into the sunset.? Clich?s like, ?Get off of my=
 planet by sundown!? More so than clich?s like, ?he died with his boots o=
n.? Marine tough the man is. Bogart tough the man is. Cagney tough the ma=
n is. Hollywood tough the man is. Cheap stick tough. And Bonzo's substant=
ial. The ultimate in synthetic selling: A Madison Avenue masterpiece ? a =
miracle ? a cotton-candy politician?Presto! Macho!

?Macho, macho man!?

Put your orders in America. And quick as Kodak your leaders duplicate wit=
h the accent being on the nukes - cause all of a sudden we have fallen pr=
ey to selective amnesia - remembering what we want to remember and forget=
ting what we choose to forget. All of a sudden, the man who called for a =
blood bath on our college campuses is supposed to be Dudley ?God-damn? Do=
-Right?

?You go give them liberals hell Ronnie.? That was the mandate. To the new=
 ?Captain Bly? on the new ship of fools. It was doubtlessly based on his =
chameleon performance of the past - as a liberal democrat ? as the head o=
f the Studio Actor's Guild. When other celluloid saviors were cringing in=
 terror from McCarthy ? Ron stood tall. It goes all the way back from Hol=
lywood to hillbilly. From liberal to libelous, from ?Bonzo? to Birch idol=
?born again. Civil rights, women's rights, gay rights?it's all wrong. Cal=
l in the cavalry to disrupt this perception of freedom gone wild. God dam=
n it?first one wants freedom, then the whole damn world wants freedom.

Nostalgia, that's what we want?the good ol' days?when we gave'em hell. Wh=
en the buck stopped somewhere and you could still buy something with it. =
To a time when movies were in black and white ? and so was everything els=
e. Even if we go back to the campaign trail, before six-gun Ron shot off =
his face and developed hoof-in-mouth. Before the free press went down bef=
ore full-court press. And were reluctant to review the menu because they =
knew the only thing available was ? Crow.

Lon Chaney, our man of a thousand faces - no match for Ron. Doug Henning =
does the make-up - special effects from Grecian Formula 16 and Crazy Glue=
. Transportation furnished by the David Rockefeller of Remote Control Com=
pany. Their slogan is, ?Why wait for 1984? You can panic now...and avoid =
the rush.?

So much for the good news?

As Wall Street goes, so goes the nation. And here's a look at the closing=
 numbers ? racism's up, human rights are down, peace is shaky, war items =
are hot - the House claims all ties. Jobs are down, money is scarce ? and=
 common sense is at an all-time low on heavy trading. Movies were looking=
 better than ever and now no one is looking because, we're starring in a =
?B? movie. And we would rather had John Wayne?we would rather had John Wa=
yne.

"You don't need to be in no hurry.
You ain't never really got to worry.
And you don't need to check on how you feel.
Just keep repeating that none of this is real.
And if you're sensing, that something's wrong,
Well just remember, that it won't be too long
Before the director cuts the scene?yea."

?This ain't really your life,
Ain't really your life,
Ain't really ain't nothing but a movie.?

[Refrain repeated about 25 times or more in an apocalyptic crescendo with=
 a military cadence.]

?This ain't really your life,
Ain't really your life,
Ain't really ain't nothing but a movie.?

there were actually two versions of THE REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED
released, the second with more instrumentation -- that's the one most people
are familiar with -- you can find it on most of the gratest hits compilations
--

If you'd like to hear the orignal version, which was mostly Gil with a drummer,
it's on his very first album, SMALL TALK AT 125th and Lenox, released in 1970
but available on CD -- The version that was a hit on the radio and that most
people remember appeared on PIECES OF A MAN, also available on CD -- The album
titled THE REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED was a much later compilation of his
early work.  Gil also had a book titled SMALL TALK AT 125th and LENOX that was
released around the same time as the first album -- most of that is available
in the more recent Third World Press book --

A very rare showing of Mina Loy's visual art work, three
collage/paintings and two drawings, is now on view in New York. For
those of you who won't be able to get there, I've posted some of
Loy's images, as well as full gallery info,

This upper east side galley show also features more familiar works by
Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Lorninghoven. The show is called "Daughters
of Dada," but the women in this show -- including the fantastic
Florine Stettheimer -- are really contemporaries of the Dadaists, not
daughters. The show is quite small, but it's a good supplement to the
big Dada show at MoMa. And for those interested in Loy, in particular ...

Charles -
thanks so much for your notice and blog post which anticipated me by
a couple of minutes!
I just got back from NY to see this small but fascinating show.  My
chief interest also was in Mina Loy - the repro can't show the
texture/depth of her pieces.  Warning - the Francis Nauman gallery,
22 E 80th, is on the 5th floor and the elevator today was out of
order - my companion had to wait for me downstairs.  The show ends
July 28th.
The Met Museum, surprised us with fine modern art show grouping, with
some great classic Stettheimers.
Charlotte

It is a compelling video. No question about it. And, for once, we see a
coup--probably supported by the USA--of an elected government fail in Latin
America. Justice prevails this time. And that is to be celebrated, and
that's what the video does. When an influential fundamentalist like Pat
Robertson publicly calls for Chavez's assassination, you get the sense that
Chavez's nationalization of the Venezuelan oil industry is deeply
threatening to USA oil and the USA government.

Still, the degree to which the video is pro-Chavez makes it sound like
everybody but the rich in Venezuela is all for Chavez. I suspect the
opposition is more diverse than that. In practice it is very hard to
nationalize the oil industry, make it work, and make it work for the
Venezuelan people. For instance, I'm under the impression that there has
been a 'brain drain' of engineering expertise in Venezuela since the
nationalization. Even native Venezuelan engineering expertise, not simply
foreign expertise. That's what I gathered from a young Venezuelan mechanical
engineer I had a couple of caipirinhas with in Rio. He's living and working
in Houston. What a pity, I thought, that this highly-trained Venezuelan is
working in Houston. He says if your politics aren't right you can't get a
job in Venezuela in the oil industry.

Whenever I see anything as univocal as this video, I wonder about its
veracity. To me, truth in matters such as politics is murkier. If the Chavez
government is primarily on the moral high ground, it would not hurt the
cause to represent the opposition in the video as something other than straw
figures.

OCAP Women of Etobicoke:
DEMONSTRATION AGAINST POLICE HARASSMENT

Friday July 7
12 pm
Outside 23 Division
2126 Kipling Ave

By TTC: Subway to Kipling Station
Take Bus #45 (Kipling North)
Get off at Redcliff Blvd and walk south to the division

The Metro Toronto Police 23 division has a long history of violent and
racist behaviour in the housing projects of North Etobicoke-charging kids
with little to no evidence, brutal arrests, trumped up charges, slamming
youth with baseless criminal records from an early age. Parents in
protecting their children are hit as hard by the division.

In the last weeks, an increasing number of youth have been targeted and
arrested by this division. One particular incident has shaken and angered
families living in Mount Olive, a housing project at Finch and Kipling. In
response to the arrest of a 14 year old boy at Mount Olive, organizer
Amina Ali says,"The boys his age used to play basketball or go to the
youth centre in Albion, but now at 7pm they have to go home. Because
they're scared - maybe I'll be booked, maybe I'll be stopped. It
traumatized the small kids under fifteen. What happened to Faizal did not
happen to him alone. It happened to the whole community."

As the government increases spending on police in poor areas in the name
of safety, poor communities feel the effects of escalating violence and
injustice at the hands of police. Accordingly, it is necessary for
communities to resist this escalation.

Friday will see the first demonstration organized by the OCAP Women of
Etobicoke. Please join us in standing against police harassment of youth
in North Etobicoke.

SPRING DIET OF FLOWERS AT NIGHT, by Frank Sherlock

"It has been night
for some time now
This is not an
observation leveraged
as blame but a wish
to be shared in the dark"

First commissioned by Jessica Lowenthal and Joshua Schuster
as part of a project entitled "Poetry, Politics, Proximity:  the
Third Annual Kerry Sherin Wright Prize."  This stunning new
poem "Spring Diet of Flowers at Night" by Frank Sherlock is
now a chapbook published by Mooncalf Press.

"There should be infinite
meaning in
the blandness of a shot
victim in an unfamiliar
neighborhood but

prospects of imagined life
are tied to clean logic

Diagetic background
music has been used to
steer me into attempting
an architectural line"

For the second time, I've had the honor of corresponding with Dr. Noam Chomsky. I asked him a pertintent (I thought) question regarding the Democratic Party. To read Dr. Chomsky's intriguing (&, possibly, infuriating) response, see PFS Post: http://www.artrecess.blogspot.com. I'm eager to see what everyone makes of this...

series A, a new reading series, is hosting its first reading on Thursday,
July 20, at the new Hyde Park Art Center at 6:00 p.m.  The featured readers
will be Kerri Sonnenberg and Chris Glomski.  I invite everyone to come out
and celebrate the launch of a new series in Chicago and to celebrate the
writing of these wonderful poets.



For more information, please see http://www.moriapoetry.com/seriesa.html.



The Hyde Park Art Center is located at 5020 S. Cornell Avenue.  The reading
will be held in the conference room.



Bios:

Chris Glomski was born in Pueblo, Colorado in 1965. Raised in Illinois, he
has also made his home in Iowa and Italy. His first collection of poems,
TRANSPARENCIES LIFTED FROM NOON, was published last fall by MEB / Spuyten
Duyvil Press in New York. His poems and critical writings have appeared in
Notre Dame Review, Chicago Review, The Octopus, Pom2, and ACM. Recently, he
has been translating poems by the Italian Nobel laureate Eugenio Montale.

Kerri Sonnenberg lives in Chicago where she directs the Discrete Reading
Series at the Elastic Arts Space in Logan Square. Her books include The
Mudra (Litmus, 2004) and Practical Art Criticism (Bronze Skull, 2004). Other
writings can be found in recent issues of MiPoesias, Factorial, Magazine
Cypress and Unpleasant Event Schedule.

Thanks for that, Dan. And for the links you provide to writing about
lettrisme.

I had not read Geof Huth's article on lettrisme but had of course seen Karl
Young's exposition at Light & Dust of lettrisme.

Geof says:

"[Isou's] ideas were simple enough: To atomize language. To reject the idea
of language and the word itself as the exalted conveyors of meaning. To
reduce art to its most elemental form, the atom of language, the letter.
Lettrism was not necessarily poetry or visual poetry at all (certainly not
to the Lettrists themselves), and Lettristic art took many forms. The
Lettrists recognized Lettrism as a new form of art, one that fetishized the
letter."

I wasn't so sure that it "fetishized the letter" because, looking at
lettristic art on Light & Dust, often there is no special emphasis on the
letter--as Geof himself remarks. What I *do* see in most lettrist work is
reflected in Geof's last paragraph:

"The Lettrists were (and sometimes are) better visual artists than either
[the Dada or Concrete poets]. The Lettrists were never as famous as either.
The Lettrists broke into more factions (the Ultra-Lettrists, the
Situationists) and made fewer friends. Lettrism, finally, lasted longer than
both. Even today Lettrists in their twenties continue to follow the precepts
of the movement as laid down by Isou and enhanced by his protege and
co-conspirator, Maurice Lemaitre."

Lettrisme is fractious, apparently. And it seems to be as much about the
synthesis of writing and visual art as it is about the atomization of
language, looking at the work itself.

There must be some compelling writing somewhere about lettrisme and Paris
around 1968? Anybody know any good books on it? Karl Young would undoubtedly
know.

Thanks again, Dan.

your interface is very kinda awkward and the graphic design to looks like a wheezer album

if it just bunch of images why all the hoops to get to the images, scrolling would work just as well and would be a lot faster

and your  typeface makes all the images look like black plastic furniture, is that the look you wanted ?


not very gee whiz kinda dull

i wrote a python script a few years ago that would take a given text in a text file, feed it into google as search strings, then return the search results as a second text file. I could dig around and find it and backchannel it to you. You'd need the Python interpreter and the pygoogle libraries installed for it to work, but they're free if you don't have them already.

the routine called dissassociated press in emacs is also a lot of

Here are the Stir Fry Texts: http://vispo.com/StirFryTexts . There are five
of them: "Log," "Spastext," "Blue Hyacinth," "Correspondence," and "Divine
Mind Fragment Theater". "Log" and "Blue Hyacinth" were done in collaboration
with Brian Lennon and Pauline Masurel; they wrote texts and worked with them
in the stir fry form. I did the programming in DHTML (Dynamic HTML).

Each of these is composed of several oft-coherent texts. Let us say n texts.
In each of the stir frys, there is something you can click to cycle through
the underlying (coherent) texts. Each of the n texts is partitioned into p
parts. The parts are phrases; each of the n texts is partitioned into the
same number of phrases. Let us say p phrases.

When you mouseOver a phrase, it gets replaced with the corresponding phrase
in the next text. Sort of as you see in the diagram at
http://www.vispo.com/StirFryTexts/images/stirfry.gif

So each stir fry has about p^n permutations (depending on the amount of
repetition of phrases, which is low).

It is foolhardy to think that this or any other movement can replace or
destroy the TV and the power that device wields.  But what this project can
do is subvert it.  We have been given the tools.  The very words that are
used to control people, to dictate their thoughts control their actions.  W=
e
will rewrite their history in our own way.  We will take their words and
re-envision them.  Take their rhetoric and make it our rhetoric.  We will
splice, deconstruct, montage, and mutate their messages to our own.  Let us
take their statements of politics, entertainment, fashion, etc=85and turn t=
hem
to our concepts. We have hundreds of channels of text waiting to be found,
to be rewritten.    Use their politics to offer up our own.  Take their
concept of art and make it ours. Make their sitcoms our comedies.  This
project is open to all who wish to mold this language of television into a
language of thought.  Your politics, aesthetics, and other beliefs are free
to be expressed. This is about community and bringing the community of poet=
s
together, no matter what school you are from. We are looking for a movement
to change the way poetry and TV is viewed.  All are welcomed to the
challenge of gaining control over the media that surrounds us.


Below is the specifics on the project.  If you would like to be a part of
this, contact the editors at the end of this message. Also any other
suggestions you might have for this projects let us know.

*Poor Man's TV Project*



The Mechanics:



Plop yourself down in front of our favorite babysitter.  Next randomly pick
15 channels.  From each channel write down the first phrase/sentence you
hear.  Repeat till you have done that with 15 channels.



Arrangement:



You can craft the poem in any style you wish.  The only restriction is all
the words must come from the 15 lines of dialog from the above step.



Refinement:



Depending on how many are involved in the final project will determine this
step.  Thanks to the Internet we can divide everyone into groups.  Each
group will be responsible for the workshoping of each other in that group.
For those in a relatively close geographic region, you might want to set up
some type of face to face workshop to help polish these poems.  The
tentative schedule will be twice a month for these workshops.  The editors
will also ask that after each workshop a copy of the poems will be sent to
us so that we can see how everything is progressing.  Part of this project
is not only the finished poems but the process of crafting them as well.




The finished project:



The goal is to have a decent anthology of these poems ready by the end of
the year.  After that we shall begin to shop this project around.



Other Fun Socialization:



So that we will all have a stable and centralized site for all things Poor
Man's TV as well as other poetic things of note; the editors will be settin=
g
up an online site (Myspace, Yahoo, or something similar) so that all of
those involved can keep in contact throughout and beyond this project. Also
any other suggestions to make this run smoothly let us know.  Until these
other ideas or up and running we will be using mass emails to get any
important information out to the participants.  The editors contact
information is below.

Interview with Boots Riley of The Coup


     Boots Riley is a communist and was an activist before becoming a
rapper. He hails from Oakland, Calif. In the song “5 Million Ways to
Kill a CEO,” he says of the city: “I’m from the land where the Panthers
grew/ You know the city and the avenue/ If you the boss we’ll be smabbin
through, and we’ll be grabbin you/ To say, ‘Whassup with the ra-venue?’”



Interview with Boots Riley of The Coup
Published Jul 9, 2006 10:22 PM

The stores make money off of very low wages
The next time you see two women running out the Gap
With arms full of clothes still strapped to the rack
Once they jump in the car, hit the gas and scat
If you have to say something, just stand and clap ...

This goes to all them hard-working women
Who risk jail-time just to make them a living
We know there'd probably be no one in prison
If rights to food, clothes and shelter were given.

These lyrics are from the song “I Love Boosters” on the rap group The
Coup’s latest release, “Pick a Bigger Weapon.” Boosters are those who
make a living by liberating clothes and other items and selling them at
discounted prices, instead of at the hugely inflated prices charged by
retail stores. The song is homage to people who live a tenuous life and
their part in poor and oppressed communities.
Boots Riley

The song and the entire full-length release by the rap group are in a
line of radical/revolutionary music that The Coup has continued to
release since 1993. That year they released their first CD: “Kill My
Landlord.”

Larry Hales of WW interviewed a very hoarse, but game, Boots Riley, lead
rapper in the group. Though Boots had a concert the previous night in
Atlanta, and was headed towards New Orleans where he was slated to
perform and meet up with activists from the Common Ground Collective, he
was willing to talk and be interviewed. He and The Coup are now on the
Pick a Bigger Weapon tour, in conjunction with notyoursoldier.org.

Boots Riley is a communist and was an activist before becoming a rapper.
He hails from Oakland, Calif. In the song “5 Million Ways to Kill a
CEO,” he says of the city: “I’m from the land where the Panthers grew/
You know the city and the avenue/ If you the boss we’ll be smabbin
through, and we’ll be grabbin you/ To say, ‘Whassup with the ra-venue?’”

Boots became active with the Progres sive Labor Party in Oakland at 15
years old. He remembers being red-baited by teachers in high school and
being outspoken then.

Larry Hales: Many people think of Oakland as synonymous with militancy
because of its history. Would that be fair to say, and what’s Oakland
like now?

Boots Riley: There are many contradictions in Oakland, like other
cities. It’s not synonymous with militancy, people are struggling to get
by, that’s why there needs to be a new struggle for basic needs. We need
to fight for reforms as part of the revolutionary struggle, but bring a
class analysis. Right now, in Oak land, there are no militant
organizations at the forefront, like the rest of the country. In the
1930s and 1940s the basic needs were part of the struggle and the
Communist Party was one of the organizations out in front. The CP did
change, though, especially in the 1950s and 1960s when red-baiting was
at its height.

LH: What part do you believe culture plays in revolution?

BR: Culture is expression, how we communicate and get across ideas. It
fills the soil and gets people ready.

LH: Before the rebellions in L.A. in 1992, hip hop was at a different
point, and its tone and militancy seemed to mirror the righteous anger
in the Black community, especially among youth, and especially in South
Central Los Angeles, with songs like “Fuck the Police.” Do you think if
hip hop was at a different point, the response after the criminal
neglect in the wake of Hurricane Katrina would have been diffe rent from
youth in the Black communities not in the area?

BR: If artists were really representing where they are from, then the
response would have been different, perhaps. A lot of artists from the
South do talk about the reality of life in the area. You have to if you
come from there, because it’s what you know. Artists have to be
relevant, though. It’s not necessarily about being more militant but
about being observant and really reporting conditions. But it’s really
the record companies. Artists are just trying to make a living, but the
record labels control the release of the material. Artists want to make
a living and the industry controls by determining what’s popular. A lot
of people point to other areas where there was a movement that dictated
culture, but there is a lack of a defined movement. When there is a
strong movement, culture will follow and the struggle will be emboldened.

LH: I know you’re tired, so I don’t want to keep you long.

BR: Yeah, and I’m losing my voice.

LH: I have two final questions. Were you inspired by the recent
immigrant rights demonstrations? And what artists do you think epitomize
certain eras of the struggle?

BR: A lot of people were surprised by the immigrant rights
demonstrations and inspired. I think Paul Robeson, Gil Scott-Heron,
Public Enemy and Bob Dylan epitomize certain eras.

challenge of gaining control over the media that surrounds us.



Below you will find an updated version of the mechanics of the project.



*Poor Man's TV Project*



The Mechanics:



Plop yourself down in front of our favorite babysitter.  Next randomly pick
15 channels.  From each channel write down the first phrase/sentence you
hear.  Repeat till you have done that with 15 channels.  If your abode lack=
s
the channels or a television necessary for this project get creative with
how you will obtain this text.  I'm sure we all have one friend who will
allow us to couch surf long enough to get the 15 lines.  There is also the
local bars which always have at least one TV running.  In short with a
little creativity the lack of a multitude of channels or a TV shouldn't pos=
e
too much of a problem.



Arrangement:



You can craft the poem in any style you wish.  The only restriction is all
the words must come from the 15 lines of dialog from the above step.



Refinement:



Depending on how many are involved in the final project will determine this
step.  Thanks to the internet we can divide everyone into groups.  Each
group will be responsible for the workshoping of each other in that group.

is not only the finished poems but the process of crafting them as well.




The finished project:



The goal is to have a decent anthology of these poems ready by the end of
the year.  After that we shall begin to shop this project around.



Other Fun Socialization:



So that we will all have a stable and centralized site for all things Poor
Man's TV as well as other poetic things of note; the editors will be settin=
g
up an online site (Myspace, Yahoo, or something similar) so that all of
those involved can keep in contact throughout and beyond this project. Also
any other suggestions to make this run smoothly let us know.  Until these
other ideas or up and running we will be using mass emails to get any
important information out to the participants.  The editors contact
information is below.

Okay, I was only able to give away five (5) anthologies. Maybe I didn't make

Happy Birthday today to Henry David Thoreau

from "Walking":

       I wish to speak a word for Nature, for absolute freedom and wildness,
as contrasted with a freedom and culture merely civil--to regard man as an
inhabitant, or part and parcel of Nature, rather than a member of society.
I wish to make an extreme statement,if so I may make an emphatic one, for
there are enough champions of civilization:  the minister and the school
committeee and every one of you will take care of that.

      The science of Humboldt is one thing, poetry is another thing.  The
poet today, nowithstanding all the discoveries of science, and the
accumulated learning of mankind, enjoys no advantage over Homer .

      . . . Perchance, when, in the course of ages, American liberty has
become a fiction of the past--as it is to some extent a fiction of the
present--the poets of the world will be inspired by American mythology.

> do it the old way  paper text scissor  hat

if 'the computer version' is basically the same as a previous way, you might
as well 'do it the old way'. it's only when 'it' is no longer the same 'it'
and 'the computer version' isn't any version that what is done with
computers starts to 'make sense' beyond being simply a labour-saving device,
even if the 'making sense' is erm problematical.

I've been doing the paper/scissors routine for nigh-on twenty years...
my tendency is to find short-cuts (yes), and I'm curious what other
people on this list use, if that's their thing, for electronic text
distortion...

I once explained my method to a college friend (not a collage friend),
and his response was "why are you worrying about jumbling your text --
what you write is hard enough to understand as it is."=20

By Elombe Brath

On Thursday, July 20, 2006, which would have been the
81st anniversary of the birth of Frantz Fanon, the
Patrice Lumumba Coalition, ArtMattan Productions and
the Theater of the Riverside Church, will present a
special screening of the historic documentary, Frantz
Fanon: His Life, His Struggle, His Work, on Thursday,
July 20th at the Theater of the Riverside Church, at
91 Claremont Avenue and 120th Street in Manhattan.
This program is the continuation of an established
tradition to celebrate the birthdays of three
illustrious Black men, Malcolm X, Patrice Lumumba and
Frantz Fanon, who were all born during the same year,
1925, as well as in the three cardinal points of the
Pan-African world: the U.S., Africa and the Caribbean.
In effect, these tri-continental icons represent the
“revolutionary class of 1925”, and became
internationally renowned during the 1960s worldwide
African liberation and Black consciousness movements,
which they each influenced in their own way.

However, although many people the U.S., Africa and the
Caribbean have regularly paid their respect for both
Malcolm and Lumumba, little attention has been given
to Frantz Fanon, a revolutionary psychiatrist who was
born on July 20, 1925 in Martinique, a will be paid
two special tributes on the 80th anniversary of his
date of birth at the Theater of the Riverside Church,
one beginning at 6 PM and the second scheduled to
begin at 8 PM.

Although born in Martinique, a French colony since
1635 (it became part of the French overseas department
in 1946), and later chose to accept President Charles
De Gaulle offer of a referendum to vote “Oui” for
pseudo-autonomy to remain part of the French Republic
or “Non”, which was self-determination and
independence, which was presented to all their
colonies; only Guinea rejected Paris’ offer.
Martinicans had mixed feelings, as did others
ensconced in the French colonial empire. Fanon, who
was mentored by Aime Cesaire, a leading figure in the
negritude movement while simultaneously being a
preeminent activist in the French Communist Party,
also struggle with such issues before deciding to go
to France to learn medicine, where he was sent to
Algeria, France’s largest colony.

After observing how France ruled its society in
general and its the colonies in particular, especially
those wretched souls who had been institutionalized in
mental hospitals, Fanon realized how deep French
racism was imbedded in both civil society and the
military. He found a feeling of disgust and alienation
with the inhumanity and contradictions in Paris and
their brutal and exploitive methods. As a result, he
eventually evolved to commit himself to the Algerian
national liberation struggle in North Africa, going on
to play a critical and dominate role in developing the
theoretical analysis psychiatric care to those
Algerians who were torn by the stress of trying to be
both French and Algerian, the former silently
strangling the latter.

His brilliant work dealing with studies on violence
and psychic damage among oppressed peoples revealed
the depth that human consciousness can be subjected to
when they are under the control of repressive regimes.
His bestselling books include “The Wretched of the
Earth”, “Black Skins, White Masks”, and “A Dying
Colonialism”, among others, and although these works
were written over four decades ago, they are still as
relevant today as they were when he first wrote them.
It is precisely because of this reason that the
organizers decided to show this splendid 52 minute
documentary directed by Cheikh Djemai, in French and
Arabic with English subtitles.

Fanon’s analysis of racism and alienation, lack of
self-esteem, and perspective of how protracted
imperialist and colonial violence finally forces the
oppressed to respond in an aggressive retaliatory
violent response to address their depraved condition.
Rebellious violent responses are natural when
oppressed and repressed peoples reach the limits of
tolerance to their submission. It would seem that
understanding Fanon should be made a priority
mandatory reading for U.S. foreign policy makers who
mistakenly believe that exploited and impoverished
peoples do not understand the difference between
foreign occupation and democratic self-determined
social order.

Fanon also understood that Black people and other
peoples of color can be frustrated to the extent that
they can be manipulated to engage themselves into
systematic violent fratricidal conflicts and
ethnocide. That this has not been yet resolved cannot
be divorced from the growing tendencies towards
genocide across the globe. Although this is mostly
sporadic it is often a widely spread frenzied behavior
that is auto-destructive and self-defeating to their
own interests. In fact, Fanon thoughts are as much
needed now as he was when we first encountered his
thoughts in the mid-1950 and throughout the 1960s and
even on up until today.

Immediately following the film will be a discussion on
the role of Fanon’s thought in the African world
struggle today. Specifically, the objective will be to
ascertain the meaning of his contributions in regards
to Black youth in Africa and throughout the African
Diaspora during the time he lived, and what lessons
can be learned from both of his race and class
analysis. For although these works were written over
four decades ago, they are still as relevant today as
they were when he first wrote them. It is precisely
because of this reason that the organizers decided to
show this splendid 52 minute documentary directed by

Diaspora during the time he lived, and what lessons
can be learned from his both race and class analysis,
particularly with the growing phenomena of scores of –
for lack of better terminology –
“lumpen-nouveau-riche-entertainment class youth”, who
are getting over by hyping pathological personal
histories in pursuit of bourgeois values and rewards.”


There will also be a bonus showing of another
important docu-drama, ‘Catch A Fire”, based on the
life of an early radical son of the English-speaking
Caribbean, Paul Bogle, the Jamaican deacon who led the
Morant Bay land reform rebellion against the Victorian
racist and class rulers in Britain and its colonies.
The British Crown was supported by France, Spain and
the U.S. to continue the oppression of the African
masses in Jamaica, even though slavery had been
abolished in 1838 – 27 years earlier. The Crown even
invoked the support of the Maroons, who had won their
freedom from the British authorities in both London
and in Kingston, inveigling the Maroons into
supporting the English through a quid-pro-quo
arrangement based on the settlement between Britain
and the Maroons in 1739. In a certain sense, the
struggle over land and white privilege that
historically was arrogated by Europeans who used brute
force to wrest away the inalienable rights of Black
people to control and own that Black people are still
struggling with today from Harare to Harlem, and other
places in the world that African people have been
dispossessed of the world’s most important real estate
– which revolutions are often fought over.

To be able to see the lives of Frantz Fanon and Paul
Bogle at the same screening is almost unbelievable.
But thanks once again to ArtMattan Productions (for
the last 14 years) your attendance can allow you to
witness that such historic gems can be paired in the
uses of cinema as a weapon to educate the masses.

Hello Poeticists,
I've backchanneled Steve about this.
But, basically, if you have a book that you think is
suited to a review in Jacket magazine you just send
the book's title, author etc and publication
details - maybe accompanied by a note on the content.
We'll list it on the unnassigned reviews list.
Once it's chosen by a reviewer we'll ask you or your
publisher to mail the book to the reviewer.
You can send your book details to John Tranter
edit@jacketmagazine.com

All the best,
Pam Brown

i'm not sure what you mean by 'distortion'--though it's an interesting term
in its assoc with electric sound.

the guitar
the electric guitar
the pen
the electric pen

i sent a link a few days ago to the stir fry texts; that is the closest my
net work has been to the cut-up method.

i did a piece called 'the pen' at http://vispo.com/I/ThePen.html that used a
software 'pen' in corelpaint (that lets you put bitmaps on the 'nib' and so
forth) and a wacom stylus to create visual 'verses'. that is a kind of
electric pen to temporarily tattoo poems onto the monitor.

a piece i did called arteroids at http://vispo.com/arteroids is not so much
cut-up as shoot up. and not so much distortion as using a different writing
instrument: director and its programming language called lingo. and the
notion of the computer game. in play mode, you can create, save, and shoot
up your texts using 'word for weirdos'. what flows from the pen in this case
are blue and green words that stalk the id-entity and arrive in ill humour.

computers are very odd things. they are language machines. language and
logic machines. this odd synthesis of language and logic gives rise to
totally improbable things like human thought--if you believe that the human
brain is fundamentally an astonishing programmable machine (i see no
evidence against this hypothesis).

we are writing the brain.

but you can also write sound, or visuals, or behaviours, etc, using language
machines. and restructure these in all sorts of ways as you see in the works
at http://vispo.com/misc/ia.htm . you could say the interactive behaviors
present in these works are simply operating on sound rather than text. some
use 'distortion' and others other processes of filter and/or arrangement.

"If the sequencer has become the paradigm for interpreting reality, thanks
to its structure that organizes flows of homogeneous information through a
continuous scan, then the Pianolina (
http://www.grotrian.de/spiel/e/info.html ), generator of random encounters
between notes, is a good metaphor for entropy." (from a review by Valentina
Culatti in neural.it of Pianolina)

Hi David,

Happy Birthday today to Henry David Thoreau

from "Walking":

       I wish to speak a word for Nature, for absolute freedom and wildness,

as contrasted with a freedom and culture merely civil--to regard man as an
inhabitant, or part and parcel of Nature, rather than a member of society.
I wish to make an extreme statement,if so I may make an emphatic one, for
there are enough champions of civilization:  the minister and the school
committeee and every one of you will take care of that.

      The science of Humboldt is one thing, poetry is another thing.  The
poet today, nowithstanding all the discoveries of science, and the
accumulated learning of mankind, enjoys no advantage over Homer .

      . . . Perchance, when, in the course of ages, American liberty has
become a fiction of the past--as it is to some extent a fiction of the
present--the poets of the world will be inspired by American mythology.

Saint Ghetto of the Loans by Gabriel Pomerand
translated from the French by Michael Kasper and Bhamati Viswanathan
only $14, ISBN: 1-933254-18-1

Saint Ghetto of the Loans reissues a legendary but little seen
masterpiece of French book art from 1950, by the Lettrist Gabriel
Pomerand. The prose poem text appears in segments on left-hand pages
(bilingually, in this edition), and its French words and syllables are
represented visually by dazzling pictographs—rebuses—on pages facing.

That Czolgosz Was An Anarchist

Beliefs Which Furnished the Motives
--more on foul doctrine, found on his person

No Use For Priests
--or their doctrine

Lying in State
(in both senses? check the record)

Matchless Possession
(of pacific islands, that is)

McKinley and Expansion!
--in that order

Free & Intelligent Conversation
--making his wants as to bathing, toilet, tobacco, etc., known in a
natural manner

Refusal to Talk

Dear Friends: We have two events in July. Please join
us.

Reading of Women of the Iranian Diaspora

Let Me Tell You Where I've Been: New Writing by Women
of the Iranian Diaspora. Join Persis Karim (editor),
Tarssa Yazdani, Aphrodite Desiree Navab, Haale, and
Paz for a reading and discussion of this new
groundbreaking anthology. Monday, July 17, 2006 at
7pm. Labyrinth Books, 536 W. 112th St., NYC. FREE.
Co-sponsored with ArteEast.

------------

Benefit Reading for The New Globe Theater with Yusef
Komunyakaa

Yusef is a Pulitzer-Prize winning poet and Vietnam
veteran. Komunyakaa is not only one of the greatest
living American poets, but an impressive speaker, so
this will be a night you won't forget. It will be on
Sunday, July 30, 2006 at 7pm at 109 Crosby Street
(Jonathan Shorr Gallery). Cocktails will be served,
and a brief documentary on The New Globe Theater will
be shown. Standard tickets are $100, but there is an
"artist's" rate of $50 - just enter that amount on the
form and that's all you'll be charged. We would all
really appreciate your help.

More info on the benefit and to purchase tickets,
click here: http://www.newglobe.org/july2006benefit/

The New Globe is a non-profit dedicated to building a
world class performing arts venue on Governors Island
in New York Harbor. Artistically driven by an Advisory
Board that includes Philip Seymour Hoffmann, Al Pacino
and Kevin Kline, the New Globe endeavors to deliver
affordable programming (from Shakespeare to jazz) to a
broad theater-going public. The stunning theater
design is by Lord Norman Foster.


Cheers

hi,

there have been a number of backchannel questions about how to get
copies of the newly released issue of ABR (contents below as sent by
joe amato), so here's the deal: if you'd like copies of this issue
only (and it's not available from your nearby, excellent, independent
bookseller), contact the ABR production manager, tara reeser, at
tareese@ilstu.edu.

if you'd like to subscribe for the next year, the cost is $24, which
you can send to:

American Book Review
Illinois State University
CB 4241
Normal IL 61790

you might want to specify that you'd like to begin with this issue,
the 5th number of volume 27 (27.5, or July/August 2006).

more general questions about the journal may be addressed to
publisher charles harris, cbharri@ilstu.edu.

thanks,

kass fleisher

hey all...i have a few friends who have been
volunteering in new orleans during the summer.  check
out the info, think about donating some of your time,
and spread the word!

onwards,

*****************************************
The People’s Organizing Committee is helping residents
build Survivors’ Councils in New Orleans and the Gulf
Coast, while helping them clean up and rebuild their
homes. POC believes that the people themselves should
be the leaders and that this is the only way justice
will be served.

The government is not helping our people rebuild or
return. We have to do it ourselves.  Hundreds of
volunteers have helped in this effort already.  Come
help us make this summer a turning point in the effort
to rebuild New Orleans!

You can expect to work hard and meet many friendly and
appreciative people.  For a full list of what to bring
and a volunteer orientation packet, visit our website
at http://www.peoplesorganizing.org

Donations of office supplies, tools and building
materials are very welcome on your trip down!

Please give us a call between 9 a.m. - 9 p.m. CST.

First, yesterday’s action will be hugely popular in the Middle East.
With mounting anger Arabs have watched the Israeli incursion into Gaza
this month with no attempt by Arab or foreign leaders to stop the
violence. Hezbollah has now intervened in dramatic fashion. Its
television station al-Manar is making sure that everyone knows. Sheikh
Nasrallah has stated that he intends to swap the three captured Israeli
soldiers for Arab prisoners. In the past Hezbollah has successfully
completed this human trade with Israeli leaders and clearly hopes to
repeat the process

Anything wrong with this argument?

Proposition A: God can think of something God can't do.

If true, then there is something God can't do.

If false, then there is something God can't do: God cannot think of
something God can't do.

Therefore (proposition B), there is something God can't do.

No, I don't think that's a problem. Because if God can't think, there's
something God can't do.

God can do something God can't do.

  God can't think of the world without himself to think about it.

  God can render the world godless.

  And can no longer think & do.

God discovered there were millions of other Gods  who can't do one thing -
communicate.

The logical question is: how can  there be only one? It's a not philosophy
question. It's a mathematical  impossibility.

it is funny that people feel the need to quantify the ideas of gods and goddesses

  when in fact it is pretty meaningless like saying i like your eye colour

  pretty harmless stuff but for the fact

  that people get killed beacause they have the wrong eye colour or they don't believe that god can cook a burrito

i like to mixed up babble fish and the other on line translators - and i did use at  grazulis cut up machine (thanks for the link) when i need to "make some text"
  but miekal is right - it all still need the human touch (or attention)  or it ends up being boring soulless shit. my rule is if i can't finish reading a page of the shit - i can't expect anyone else to


  these on line tool are easy to work with (especially while doing my day job - it's less messy  too) cuz it's all little electrons

  but i still have to go back and work the words

The only way this is not a paradox is if the barber's face is hairless, e.g.
a woman.

Or perhaps the barber is prepubescent and when he attains hairitude, the
town has a new child take over shaving duties.

Interesting, in some small amount, but pointless.

As for G-d, it's a matter of the supreme being(s) existing on a totally
different frequency than those things that think, pick up things, or eat
burritos.  In Buddhist logic, there are choices other than "is" and "is
not" -- there are also "is AND is not" and "NEITHER is NOR is not."  The
western way of thinking does not approach G-d.

Isn't this itself just a variation of the original Epimenides Paradox?
(" 'Cretans always lie,' said the Cretan. 'Of Cretan stock am I; am I
Cretan?' ")?

Here's today's promotional gimmick:





As we all know, it's Walt's hundred and somethingth birthday. If he
accomplished nothing else, he reminded us that grass does, technically, have
leaves. I was just thinking the other day how awesome grass is, in fact.



Today and today only, (Friday, July fourteenth), I will include the names of
everyone who gives a buck to http://observable.org/dollar/ in a new Whitman
Birthday poem, and I'll submit that poem to Atlantic, New Yorker, and the
Nation!  You can bet your observable dollar it will be accepted, too!!



And of course, you'll be listed as a Gentle Citizen.





Love-

It's also a question of necessity. And, of course, our western way of think=
ing (dichotomizing) really limits the possibilities; of which, of course, i=
s all possibilities, and therefore, none. There are never only two sides to=
 something. There are an infinite amount of sides and no sides at all: infi=
nity and zero are equal.

there are problems with the proposition and the argument; below would be =
a
cleaner proposition BUT if "thinking" is B, well, "can't do" clearly =
isn't
"not B" -- but it is trying to be nearly so, I believe; there's also =
that
tricky prepositional phrase, "of x"

A can B [of x] A can not B.

problems with the proposition:  assumptions about A, assumptions about
"thinking" and "doing" having a peculiar relationship, problems with
"thinking" of a "thing" that is also an "action"; if you really want to
extend the statement, you would get rid of the x qualification

problems about first if statement:  x exists that A can not B:

well, it is not the true statement coming from the prop, which would be

x exists that A can B x and A can not B x

problems with the second if statement:  x exists that A can not B:

Not really anything wrong with it. But it's a paradoxical statement that to require weight needs an additional assertion of god's omnipotence. The force of the paradox comes in denying that god can be omnipotent, but in order to get there, you have to make a straw man of the assertions of god's omnipotence. Most competent theologians would have no problem with the assertion that there are things that God can't do, as by omnipotence they generally don't mean that God can do anything, but that god can do anything that it is possible to do. paradoxes rely on the abuse of grammar and are essentially unresolvable. That is, it's not possible to make two paradoxical statements both true. So no theologian is going to assert that doing that is something God can do, so would have no trouble with asserting that God can think of something God can't do. In fact, they'd probably say God can think of an infinite variety of things he can't do, more things than any person could ever come up !
 with.

Of course the entirety of the argument falls apart because they are essentially grammatical assertions about grammatical facts that, in order to be any trouble at all, have to be misused in the wrong context. It's the same problem with all metaphysical propositions, and it's the problem that renders all metaphysical propositions senseless in uncle ludwig's sense.

New media poetry--poetry composed, disseminated, and read on
computers--exists in various configurations, from electronic documents =
that
can be navigated and/or rearranged by their "users" to kinetic, visual, =
and
sound materials through online journals and archives like UbuWeb, =
PennSound,
and the Electronic Poetry Center. Unlike mainstream print poetry, which
assumes a bounded, coherent, and self-conscious speaker, new media =
poetry
assumes a synergy between human beings and intelligent machines. The =
essays
and artist statements in this volume explore this synergy's continuities =
and
breaks with past poetic practices, and its profound implications for the
future.

=20

By adding new media poetry to the study of hypertext narrative, =
interactive
fiction, computer games, and other digital art forms, New Media Poetics
extends our understanding of the computer as an expressive medium, =
showcases
works that are visually arresting, aurally charged, and dynamic, and =
traces
the lineage of new media poetry through print and sound poetics, =
procedural
writing, gestural abstraction and conceptual art, and activist =
communities
formed by emergent poetics.=20

that's the liar paradox, which is different. the barber paradox is at root just a contradiction and not a true paradox. the liar paradox rests on bad grammar just like all true paradoxes. Basically it breaks down in the assignation to "always" to mean "in all cases in all possible worlds" which is a special meaning for always borrowed from the grammar of geometry in the case of epimenides, and mathematical logic in modern formulations, and applied to an empirical proposition. If you really understand what always means in this context, and every native speaker does (it means something like "usually" but with a little more rhetorical oomph), then there is no paradox.

I used to shop at the B X all the time!

  Excellent redux.  All summed up so nicely in our former president's statement, "that depends on what your definition of "is" is."

  Remember, God died a long time ago, and we killed him

  her

  it.

  So, as it stands now, the alleged God can't do anything at all anyway, much less shave anybody.

A good way to think of Jason's paradox/grammar distinction is this:

Some dogs have floppy ears.
My dog has floppy ears.
Therefore, my dog is SOME dog!

This, like "always", as explained, is an equivocation on the word:
using it in two senses without carefully distinguishing the senses.
Poets like to conflate connotations and even meanings in the way jazz
pianists like to hit two side-by-side keys on the piano because the
note they really want is somewhere in between, sort of, or they are
on the way somewhere else that the tension of the dissonance leads to
or is resolved by, so these kinds of paradoxes are superficially
attractive. Starting with them can be fun and exciting; It's stopping
at them that is dangerous.

Yes, my bad. As I have since learned, it's his father Walter Whitman's
birthday.

I am not sure what to do now, as my whole day was planned around Walt
Whitman. Do I try to pretend these photographs and recordings are of Woody
Guthrie? That this old beach toga is somehow related to Bastille Day?  Any
suggestions will be welcome.

Can God fuck up
Voltaire so badly that
He can't cook a burrito?

How many Gods
Does it take to
Change a light bulb?

Can some dog
Think of some god
So powerful that he could think
Of a thinking dog?

http://ubu.com/sound/vexations.html

Pianoless Vexations (MP3): 8 hours of MP3s recorded live at The Sculpture Center, NYC on
June 11, 2006. Vexations was composed by Erik Satie in 1893 and consists of a short motif
repeated 840 times. Vexations was first performed publicly by John Cage and several other
pianists over the course of 19 hours in 1963. As the title conveys, artists performing in
Pianoless Vexations used any instrument except the piano to perform Satie's original
composition. Instruments included laptops, drums, guitar, French horn, violin, trumpet,
saxophone, viola, recorder, toy piano, harpsichord, mandolin, bass, film projectors,
voice, dulcimer and more. Artists include Randy Nordschow; Hay Sanders; Bruce Pearson and
Marco Navarette; Daphna Mor, Rachel Begley, and Nina Stern; Bruce Arnold Jazz Trio; Alan
Licht and Angela Jaeger; String Messengers; Rusty Santos; Amy Granat; Greg Kelley; Miguel
Frasconi; Bethany Ryker; D. Edward Davis and Erik Carlson; Zachary Seldess; Charles
Waters and Katie Pawluk; Andrew Lampert and Steve Dalachinsky; Margaret Leng Tan; Trudy

It reminds me of Ambrose Bierce's defintion:

GRAVITATION, n. The tendency of all bodies to approach one another with a
strength proportion to the quantity of matter they contain - the quantity of
matter they contain being ascertained by the strength of their tendency to
approach one another. This is a lovely and edifying illustration of how
science, having made A the proof of B, makes B the proof of A.

For the most part, we've gotten some great responses to this project.
It is being re posted to see if anyone else might be interested in
joining up.
Below you will find all the particulars.












It is foolhardy to think that this or any other movement can replace or
destroy the TV and the power that device wields.  But what this project can
do is subvert it.  We have been given the tools.  The very words that are
used to control people, to dictate their thoughts control their actions.  W=
e
will rewrite their history in our own way.  We will take their words and
re-envision them.  Take their rhetoric and make it our rhetoric.  We will
splice, deconstruct, montage, and mutate their messages to our own.  Let us
take their statements of politics, entertainment, fashion, etc=85and turn t=
hem
to our concepts. We have hundreds of channels of text waiting to be found,
to be rewritten.    Use their politics to offer up our own.  Take their
concept of art and make it ours. Make their sitcoms our comedies.  This
project is open to all who wish to mold this language of television into a
language of thought.  Your politics, aesthetics, and other beliefs are free
to be expressed. This is about community and bringing the community of poet=
s
together, no matter what school you are from. We are looking for a movement
to change the way poetry and TV is viewed.  All are welcomed to the
challenge of gaining control over the media that surrounds us.



Below you will find an updated version of the mechanics of the project.



*Poor Man's TV Project*



The Mechanics:



Plop yourself down in front of our favorite babysitter.  Next randomly pick
15 channels.  From each channel write down the first phrase/sentence you
hear.  Repeat till you have done that with 15 channels.  If your abode lack=
s
the channels or a television necessary for this project get creative with
how you will obtain this text.  I'm sure we all have one friend who will
allow us to couch surf long enough to get the 15 lines.  There is also the
local bars which always have at least one TV running.  In short with a
little creativity the lack of a multitude of channels or a TV shouldn't pos=
e
too much of a problem.



Arrangement:



You can craft the poem in any style you wish.  The only restriction is all
the words must come from the 15 lines of dialog from the above step.



Refinement:



Depending on how many are involved in the final project will determine this
step.  Thanks to the internet we can divide everyone into groups.  Each
group will be responsible for the workshoping of each other in that group.
For those in a relatively close geographic region, you might want to set up
some type of face to face workshop to help polish these poems.  The
tentative schedule will be twice a month for these workshops.  The editors
will also ask that after each workshop a copy of the poems will be sent to
us so that we can see how everything is progressing.  Part of this project
is not only the finished poems but the process of crafting them as well.




The finished project:



The goal is to have a decent anthology of these poems ready by the end of
the year.  After that we shall begin to shop this project around.



Other Fun Socialization:



So that we will all have a stable and centralized site for all things Poor
Man's TV as well as other poetic things of note; the editors will be settin=
g
up an online site (Myspace, Yahoo, or something similar) so that all of
those involved can keep in contact throughout and beyond this project. Also
any other suggestions to make this run smoothly let us know.  Until these
other ideas or up and running we will be using mass emails to get any
important information out to the participants.  The editors contact
information is below.

This is not true. God tries to interfere with the Web, but the Web
interprets those attempts as noise, and works around the problem.

Old mistake.
That is human philosophical thought,
which is more proof of
(a) humanity's fallen nature
(b) the distance between human thought and God's consciousness.

 Plus, Saint Anselm started that "card trick" game-- the Ontological argument, in his "Monologion". It's the exact same basic thing....in reverse:
        1) God is something that "can not be bettered in thought", ie you can think of nothing greater, whether or not you believe in Him, right?
         2) God can either exist "objectively" in reality or is the "greatest thought", that exists only as a thought, BUT if he exists as only a thought, you can conceive of something greater, which means, THEREFORE,
         3) God exists objectively & in reality, & as the "greatest thought".
  Just a card trick, & the thing here is just a card trick, too.
       Love,
         Adam Fieled

I have enjoyed the responses to this thread, and Aldon's post made me laugh
so hard I cried.

I take it there were only two serious challenges to my argument. Amy King
said:

"God can do something God can't do."

If God can do the logically impossible then it seems likely to me that
reasoning about God is pointless. It's like asserting that 0=1 or
true=false. Which is fine but there isn't much of logic left afterwards.

I did not understand Catherine's post. It may well be serious but I don't
get it.

Diane di Prima said:

"...both "do" and "think" are totally meaningless concepts vis-à-vis "god"".

This may be true but, if so, there is something God can't do. This is the
same sort of objection Tom raised.

Jason Quackenbush says:

"Most competent theologians would have no problem with the assertion that
there are things that God can't do, as by omnipotence they generally don't
mean that God can do anything, but that god can do anything that it is
possible to do."

I suspect it's true that competent theologians would have no problem with
it, though I have not studied theology, because the notion that God can do
anything and everything is demonstrably false. There is nothing paradoxical
about it.

Phil Primeau says:

"Uh, I'm pretty sure the whole "Can God make something so big even he can't
move it?"/"Can God cook a burrito so hot even he can't eat it"/"Can God fuck
up so badly that even he can't fix it" schtick went out with Voltaire. Or
something."

Keep in mind that in the thirties Godel basically used propositions such as
'This proposition is not provable' to demonstrate the existence of
'undecidable propositions' (propositions that are well-formed, cannot be
assumed to be false, and are unprovable but true). Well-phrased logical
conundrums do not disappear forever; they resurface when new methods of
logic are brought to bear on them, as Godel did in the thirties. The
examples Phil gives are indeed variations on the argument I presented, but
Phil's examples, to me, unnecessarily introduce side issues. The central
issue is whether there is something God can't do. Best to stick to it and
not introduce questions concerning gravity, for instance.

I think it's popularly believed that we cannot reason with any certainty
about many things. When Georg Cantor presented his 'transfinite arithmetic',
which gives us some knowledge about the nature of the infinite, his work was
spat upon by prominent mathematicians of the day. But his work is now
routinely taught to all undergraduates in mathematics. And it does give us
fascinating knowledge about the infinite we did not have prior to his work.
And it is gorgeous work. Godel used Cantor's methods in some of Godel's
equally profound and gorgeous theorems.

Reasoning about God, infinity, and other ideals such as love, truth,
justice, and beauty is of course very tricky indeed. But I suspect that if
we conclude it simply cannot be done with any precision and utility, we
underestimate the power of reason and its capacity to help us clarify and
honour our ideals.

Maybe it all boils down to another Ambrose Bierce quotation, his
rendering of the cogito:

"I think I think; therefore I think I am."

My own version is a bit similar to the earlier mentioned "some dog" idea:

"I think, therefore something is."

That should cover also for the possibility that we are all part of
somebody's or something's dream or virtual world.

After reading everything in this thread, especially Jim Andrews' latest,  it
begins to look as if the linguistic analysts are right -- the proper domain
of philosophy is to discuss the vagaries of language, as, when you get right
down to it, everything else is opinion -- there are no "facts."

Too, to continue with Karl-Erik's subthread; in "reality" it's not "Cogito
Ergo Sum."  This postulates a thinker as a given, therefore invoking, IMHO,
a post hoc prompter hoc fallacy.  Descartes should have said, "Cogito ergo
cogitatum."  The only thing that can be deduced from thinking is thought,
not a thinker.

But I may be wrong. . .

This is not what I, at least, said. This is antifoundationalism at
its potential for the worst. There are, indeed, facts -- we just see
those facts through the medium of language, so that we do not
apprehend them purely and immediately. But it is not the case that
there are "no facts" because we perceive facts through the lens of
language. It means that it's hard to perceive the facts as they are
without a good deal of work, if we can do it at all.

Those who maintain there are "no facts" are welcome to experiment by
getting in the car, accelerating to 70 mph, and then swerving
abruptly into oncoming traffic while vociferously denying that they
are doing so -- and see if it helps.  There are facts. We may have a
less-than-perfect grasp of those facts through the languages we use,
but there are facts.

There is a foundational reality that is impervious to our efforts to
understand or describe or manipulate without developing an
appropriate language. Langauge is important, but it's not everything,
as those who would say "there are no facts" would have it.

This is an all too common misconstrual of an antifoundationalist position --
close cousin to Sokal's open invitation to "postmodernists who don't believe
gravity exists" (who would appear themseleves not to exist) to jump out his
office window.

The phrase "facts on the ground" is a metaphor, a fact forgotten at our peril.
If one swerves into approaching traffic at 70 mph while vociferously denying
that they are doing so (and to whom is this denial addressed?), one will have
an accident.  One will have crahed into another vehicle, not into a fact.  It
will be a fact that one has crashed into another car.

Again, who are "those who maintain there are 'no facts'"? that is, aside from
posts on this list -- The debate, like the debate about "truth," is a debate
about the nature of "fact," what it is to be "factual."  Facts exist in
language.  Our production and manipulation of them will, in fact, have
observable effects in the "real" world. "Facts" don't exist out there in the
"real" world, waiting for us to "grasp" them.  Facts and the grasping of them
take place in language.  This is not to say that there is nothing but language

wait, aldon -- facts differ from truths though, don't they? -- in
that they point to potentially non-discursive realities... that is,
they surely function with regard to discourse, but have an element
that resists discursive resolution... statements of fact are in fact
statements, and will have an effect on what we mean by fact -- but
this does not mean that what they reference is itself a statement...

we hunt the accident site for verification that an accident took
place... we can search through the newspapers too for confirmation,
but that's only a related matter...

now there are certain kinds of truth (with a capital T) that, for
some, point to non-discursive realities (e.g., god)... generally,
though, truth is propositional, hence cannot avoid its obligations to
discourse, logic and the like... you can posit (truth table) truths,
for instance, that are not a matter of verifiability... just create a
statement, say it's true, and it's contrapositive must be true
(logically)... that kind of validity need not apply to the factual...

just to clarify a bit... what this has to do with antifoundationalism
is another matter...

IF I follow you here, you're positing "fact" as a subcategory of "truth."
What a fact references may or may not be a statement -- but in that it differs
not at all from any other category of statement -- the word "rock" may be taken
as 'pointing" to a non-discursive reality in a way that the word "two" might
not, I suppose -- but the key is that "pointing" -- when you search the
accident site, you may produce facts, but you're looking at things -- those
things become facts in your regard -- Any of us who watches Court TV knows how
easily the same "non-discursive" reality can produce quite patently opposed
"facts" -- It then becomes the job of the jury, through entirely discursive
means, to determine what will be regarded as the fact of the matter.  The jury
is the trier of fact -- they decide what the fact is -- we then call their
report to us "findings" --

speaking of which -- have y'all been following the tangled case in LA where an
extrmely expensive car was involved in an accident recently?  When the police
arrived on the scene they met up with fellows who represented themselves as
being homeland security authorities -- the driver was nowhere in evidence --
these are all facts -- we're nowhere ear the truth as yet, though it has been
determined that the "homeland security" guys' badges were issued by a local
security outfit with no relationship to the actual department of homeland
security --

The police arriving at the scene were confronted with a number of facts menat
precisely to lead them away from the truth.

and we thought poetry was complex!

aldon, i don't think that facts and truths belong to the same
category of, uhm, discourse?!... seriously, though -- we don't permit
facts the luxury of being simply propositional, and so i don't see
the factual as a subcategory of truth (not least b/c i don't think
atoms are a subcategory of language -- i'm enough of a realist to
suppose that atoms, whatever we name them, are 'out there'
independently of my language practices, though here of course we may
need new language practices to describe any new understandings of
atoms)...  i'm willing to grant that facts are not, practically
speaking, as factual as we like to think they are, and that this is
owing to language, textuality, contextuality, etc... but facts have
to be granted some measure of referential stability (if that's the
right term) wrt the actual in order to "get at" what they do for us...

otherwise, we're getting into (most urgently and in the realm of the
human) some slippery ethical territory here of the sort that hayden
white inquired into in that great essay, "the politics of historical
interpretation:  discipline and desublimation"... white, as i recall,
takes up this question of holocaust denial, and i think here, aside
from more purely philosophical speculation, it would be good to lay
our hands on some approximate facts prior to proceeding toward
pertinent truths and the like...

mike l, i think this has everything to do with poetics,
notwithstanding our admittedly armchair approach to some gnarly
matters (ditto the earlier comments re paradox and the like, and
godel/cantor)... i could make this into a pedagogical issue right
quick, but i'm not sure i have the stomach for classroom
conversations right now, with a month left before classes start...

best,

joe

This is, of course, the point, and the rebuttal to the notion that
there is no such thing as "facts". The fact is that if you thus
swerve as described you will have an accident, no matter how often or
to whom you deny that there is any such thing as a "fact". Your
denial is unimpressive to the foundational reality irrespective of
the sincerity of your belief in antifoundationalism, or the
vociferousness of your denial of the foundational reality.

> Again, who are "those who maintain there are 'no facts'"?<

I quoted one on this very list. His name seems to be J. Michael
Mollonhan, thus:

Why aside from them? Isn't that who's talking about this issue?

When you say there are no facts out there in the real world waiting
for us to grasp them, that the only way to grasp facts is "in
language" then what you ARE saying is that there is "nothing but
language" BECAUSE you've said there are no real facts out there in
the real world. The antifoundationalist position is precisely that
there are no facts, no real world, only the social construct we make
up for ourselves out of our language, expectations, and behaviors.
The refutation of this very silly position is to go ahead and swerve
into oncoming traffic or jump out Sokal's window. You cannot
reasonably have it both ways. If you won't jump out the window or
swerve into traffic in order to prove your assertion that there are
no facts and no real world, then one thing is obvious:  you're not
willing to test your antifoundationalist claims.

Language is important, but language is not all there is. There IS a
real world out there; there ARE facts out in that real world. We can
only grasp that world, those facts, THROUGH languages of various
kinds (English, Chinese, mathematics, and the like) but that we grasp
at reality and facts through an imperfect medium is not a good
argument that only the imperfect medium exists.

Jim,

Isn't Cantor's concept of "transfinite sets" based on a contradiction, that
cardinal numbers (to which always a number can be added) is an aleph zero set
"followed" by other aleph sets?

It seems to me an authentically new idea always contains a contradiction. an
"impossibility," of which the idea of God is one set.

I think there's a useful distinction to be made here between "states of affairs" which you are here calling a fact, and what I think of as a fact,
meaning the way that states of affairs are represented in language. I really disagree with this notion that the only way we can get at states of
affairs is through language, and stating that facts can only be talked about in language is pretty much a tautology and an uninteresting one at that.

One problem i do have with your account though, although i may just be misunderstanding you, is what you mean by "foundational reality" and
"antifoundationalism." To me these look like unjustifiable metaphysical claims that don't amount to much. If all you mean by them though is the truth
of propositions like "if you jump out of a window you will fall" or "if you drive into oncoming traffic, you will have a car accident" then I really
don't see what's so special about them that they need this special theory called "foundational reality" to defend them. Can't you just, following
uncle ludwig, point to them and go "look and see."

I guess my real issue is that all of this really comes down to the distinction between empirical facts and grammatical remarks. For those who aren't
familiar with the terminology, the statement that "a dropped object has fallen on the ground" is an empirical fact, in that its truth or falsity can
be established by looking at it, and a grammatical fact like "today is saturday" can be established simply by the meaning of the words. Certain
meanings are established by convention, and while this can often be arbitrary, it's arbitrariness does not imply that it is in someway subjective or
thought dependent. That's just stupid, and so is anyone who says so. But at the same time, there are limits to what can be talked about. Language
breaks down beyond it's language-games, and so when you or anyone else starts talking about "foundational reality" or saying that we have a "less than
perfect grasp of the facts" it seems to me that you aren't really saying anything meaningful at all.

We have a grasp of the facts. In the future, we may have different ideas about those states of affairs, or just talk about those states of affairs in
more nuanced ways. Will those facts be different? yes they will be. will that mean that the facts that we used to talk about are not facts? no. Where
  people get into trouble is by assuming that there is something to the objective correlative idea of truth, that is, that something is true because
it corresponds to reality. But that's a meaningless statement. You might as well say "Something is true because it is not false." or worse "Something
is true because it is true." It's not precisely circular, but it is an attempt to make an empirical fact out of a grammatical one. The fact of the
matter is (hah!) that there are lots of things in ordinary language that we can mean by "fact" and there are lots of ways that we use the word "true."
Here is a brief sample for true:

true can mean:
I agree with that
I believe this to be the case
It gives me a certain feeling to assert this
you'd have to be an idiot to state otherwise
or my favorite disquotational definition: to say the sentence "P is F" is true is just to say P is F.

Where i think everybody goes off the rails on this stuff is just to forget the differences uncle ludwig wanted to teach us. To ignore the tendency
toward idealization and remember that words really only have meaning in their ordinary usage, and it's quite addle brained to try to inflate these
ideas into the kinds of garbage that philosophers are wont to talk when they are doing philosophy. From this perspective, both foundationalism and
anti-foundationalism are gravely mistaken and our best bet is to stop talking about that metaphysical claptrap by pointing out just how senseless that
sort of talk is. which i hope i've gone some way of doing in this email.

again Marcus, i never think we're entirely in disagreement, just we like to slice things precisely but in slightly different ways.

"God can do something God can't do."

Like photons, for example?  Indeterminate dual quantum states are held by very real thing/ings.  I'm not arguing for God, but demonstrating some contradictory property of a thing does not imean that thing's existence is impossible.  I mean, I am frighteningly contradictory, and yet I exist.

I exist, which is a fact and also true.  that unicorns exist is a fact, but it isn't true that they do.  or, wait, it is true, there is a gloss of 'true,' that supports the notion that unicorns exist.  i run into unicorns every so often.  many of you just did while reading this.  i mean, it's both a fact and true that a unicorn is imaginary, and running into imaginary things is a factual and true experience that is also imaginary.  but i'm already falling into the trap of advocating a means to defining meaning.  such an effort works best for giving orders, which is of course a revelation of one's will to control others.

words such as 'fact' and 'truth' can be defined in so many ways--not only the number of meanings but also the methods used to identify instances of that proliferation of meaning.  that is to say descriptive approaches to defining terms, even in the most complex of ways (e.g., semantic networks) have normative elements in their rule sets, and of course normative methods themselves make us feel like we're getting away from the facts and/or truths about the meaning(s) of 'fact' and 'truth.'  this essentially describes a rabbit hole.

it's relatively simple to find means and methods for defining words for, say, a computational system.  but the standards and goals are relatively simpler than the needs here.  when we break into philosophy not only do we break into modes of dictating some particular means of thinking but also break into a state where our language requrements are very hi-fi.  decontextualized pronouns illustrate well the problems of such an effort.

if marcus bales were to demonstrate notions of fact and truth by running in front of a massive and swiftly moving object such as a motor vehicle it would be a redundant act.

In the back of my mind I keep hearing Johnny Cash singing "What is Truth?"--
a single from the late 1960's--and this from Pascal:

      "Is there no substantial truth, seeing that there are so many true
things which are not truth itself?"

      That's from the "The Wager" which I  highly recommend for what it has
to say using probabilty, infinity/nothing, in relation with God, truth . . .
a very unique approach!

I'm in graduate school now studying rhetoric and thinking about some
of these things or I wouldn't be posting to this philo thread. One
thing the rhetoric tradition offers is a way to engage the world
through reason, not in order to obtain truth, but to work in the
realm of doxa. The classical rhet folks stress probability over
truth. And there's Hume, who I've been reading all summer, who says
reason is just what forces its way into our understanding of certain
relations of experience. It's a kind of fundamental instinct (of
which Aristotle says plenty), but it doesn't bring us any closer to
clarity or truth or whatever. The imagination, reason's strange
double, somehow seems like a more useful tool for achieving an
understanding of the situation we encounter day-to-day. And, you
know, according to the big shots, like Boethius as he confronted his
own ticket out of here, its the union of sensation, reason, AND
imagination that generates a meaning that gets us beyond the sludge
of every day impressions. "Precision" I appreciate, but "utility"
seems so blah and unnecessary. If there's anything philosophy could
offer it would be a way to approach uselessness--though that would be
a poetics--and leave us dancing, not doing

My 2 cents,
Dale

seems to me the line between physics and metaphysics is continual
disappearing act, arguably the entire point of scientific investigation. as
Bertrand Russell says (i'm full of Russell quotes this week),"The world is
full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper."
what seems like metaphysics today...
what seems like god today...
anyway, i get joy from the idea that over time we can disentangle a bit mor=
e
of our psychology (fear, superstition in particular) from our understanding
of How Things Work.

the idea of simultaneity, as well as reciprocal causality, seems to irk
people & is hence omitted from the conversations wherein they're most
relevant. "What men really want is not knowledge but certainty," again,
Bertrand Russell (also "Most people would rather die than think; in
fact,they do so.")=20
i sometimes get rather riled about it. the elephant in the room.

Poets and fiction writers involved with the Neighborhood Writing Alliance

will perform with The Ways & Means Trio

at Muse Café — 8-10 p.m. on Tuesday, July 18

as part of the Lower & Upper Limits series

The Neighborhood Writing Alliance (NWA) provides opportunities for adults to
reflect on, discuss, and write about their personal histories and everyday
experiences. We host weekly writing workshops in Bronzeville, Douglas,
Uptown, West Englewood, East Garfield Park, Hyde Park/Woodlawn, the Near
West Side, and South Lawndale. The Neighborhood Writing Alliance believes
that writing about personal experiences and one’s neighborhood—and sharing
those experiences–can lead to increased community involvement. Workshop
participants read and perform their work at public venues throughout
Chicago. Participants are published in our quarterly magazine, the Journal
of Ordinary Thought(JOT), with its motto, Every Person Is a Philosopher.

Lower & Upper Limits is a series at Muse Café that explores collaborations
between poets and musicians and relationships between language and music.
The Ways & Means Trio is Jayve Montgomery (reeds, percussion, electronics),
Joel Wanek (upright bass, cello), and Daniel Godston (trumpet, percussion).
The title of this series is taken from Louis Zukofsky’s “A-12”: “I’ll tell
you. / About my poetics -- music / speech / An integral / Lower limit speech
/ Upper limit music.” Lower & Upper Limits happens at Muse Café on the third
Tuesday of the month. Ways & Means will be performing with Toni Asante
Lightfoot on Tuesday, August 15.

Muse Café is at 817 N. Milwaukee Ave. in Chicago, and the phone number is
312.850.2233. The Chicago station on the CTA blue line is a half a block
away. This event is free and open to the public, donations appreciated. For
more information about the Neighborhood Writing Alliance, please contact
(773) 684-2742 or editors@jot.org, or visit their website at www.jot.org.

in reading over this thread, it occurs to me that we might do well to
distinguish between certain species of fact... that facts are often
proven not to be facts, over time, suggests as much... for instance,
i know that i will die... my death, that is, will ultimately become
what, for me (and i hope, for others!), is an incontrovertible
fact... now, history may well intervene to suggest that i'd never
even lived -- and this falsehood may become a fact... so of course,
fact is subject to the whims of history, for one, to the operations
of discourse... one ethical obligation here, then, would be to
restore to the world the correct grasp of the actual, i.e., in my
case, the fact that i lived and died...

but the fact that people are born and die, breathe and stop breathing
-- that particular generalization re the mortal coil hasn't changed a
whole helluvalot over past millennia... how we understand this fact
is of course entirely mutable, culturally specific, etc... but as
whitehead put it, there is no parting from your own shadow (and his
"fallacy of mispaced concreteness" has a lot to do, perhaps, with why
fact itself can seem at times so unfactual)... perhaps human fact and
physical fact operate somewhat differently, but to deny that facts
are purely discursive on the basis of those many past facts that are
no longer understood to be facts (b/c of faulty politics, or faulty
conjecture, or faulty experiment, or what have you) is, to me, to
miss a key and absolutely vital distinction...

future generations may indeed posit that the holocaust never
happened, for instance, and they may call this a fact... i rather
doubt it... but we know, i hope and in any case, that such a belief
is predicated on sheer falsehood... as we like to say, the fact is
that it DID happen... fact, that is, points to the actual---this is
its function semantically, even ethically---regardless of whether it
points correctly... so if fact is imbricated in discourse, it's
nonetheless the case that its purpose as a word (if you will) is to
permit us to designate a (variously, sure) stable aspect of the
real... its referential designations, that is, point for me to many
things that are undeniably actual (out of which we get, or ought to
get, statements of truth---but truth is another matter, as is logic,
though i suspect, to be something of a positivist about it, that one
could make a pretty good case for a necessary correlation twixt these
categories)...

at any rate, it's probably true (!), too, that, at bottom, there's an
act of faith in assuming a relative stability in any number of
facts... i have faith, that is, that the holocaust happened, even
though i wasn't there, and this faith has nothing whatever to do, at
this point, in any future "evidence" that might be contrived to prove
otherwise (sometimes being stubbornly close-minded might not be a bad
thing!)... i have faith in the tenets of evolutionary theory, too,
whatever problems there might be with same, over and against what is
being called intelligent design... i would observe, as well, that a
similar act of faith inheres in the desire to see fact as *entirely*
subject to the mutability of discourse, truth statements, etc. (i.e.,
as entirely a matter of historical/human/and even grammatical
contingency)... but again, i would argue that this is not the
function of the word, "fact" -- and we needn't go to the dictionary
to figure this out, either...

anyway... when i got up this morning, my feet hit the ground...
really, they really did, i swear...

As I understand (or misunderstand) it, a factual statement
is one that is capable of verification, whether it's true or
not (as opposed to, say, a judgment--which is not capable
of being proven or verified).

So, yes, there are categories of fact: those that are or prove
to be true, those that are not, and those that may or may not
be.

It still looks to me like a more basic distinction is being slipped here --
again, you have it right when you say that "facts" point to something, but then
you consistently conflate "facts" with that to which they point -- which was
the point I was trying to make in the first place -- the "antifoundationalist"
position does not say there is no material reality, nor does it say that there
are no facts -- It tries to keep from conflating facts with that which Dr.
Johnson kicked his foot against in refuting Bishop Berkeley --
------------------
responding to other responses

I first met a nephew of Wittgenstein thirty-five years ago -- His response to
everything other than his own thought was that it was either (1) nonsense, or
(2) trivial -- unfotunately, I let that experience hold me back from reading
Uncle himself for several years - I'm glad I got over that reluctance --


the reason I asked for the names of people not posting to this list who didn't
believe there is such a thing as a fact goes back to our experience with the
postmodern thread a few weeks ago.  When I asked who among theorists of the
postmodern had said that there is no such thing as truth, I was supplied with a
quotation, not from a theorist of the postmodern, but from somebody opposed to
them who accused tham of saying there is no such thing as truth -- So, when I
asked who says there is no such thing as fact (as opposed to somebody who has
an arugment about what facts are and what they mean), it was in hopes of
hearing of somebody I could go read who actually held such a position, as
opposed to having such a position ascribed to him or her --

__________

back to my good friend and correspondent Joe -- There are indeed several species
of fact -- and let us not forget Norman Mailer's identification of its close
cousin, the factoid --

and as to antifoundationalism -- it should be seen as an argument about how one
meets the ethical obligation to restore the correct grasp of the actual -- how
to know what "correct" is -- which entails knowing what "grasping" a fact means
-- It does not mean grasping the dead, or grasping their death -- It may mean
grasping that they have died -- an entirely different matter --

and we should never forget Mr. Schlemiel (sp?), the unfortunate who was indeed
parted from his own shadow -- a fate so sad that his name, if not its correct
spelling, lives on among us --

yours,
the shadow

ok, i thought i'd change the subject -- or try to  (b/c i'm sounding
too labored even to my own ears re this matter of fact vs --) -- by
calling attention to an excellent and timely piece that appears in
today's ~new york times magazine~, by jon gertner, "atomic balm?"...
gertner hits all the right notes re nuclear power, to my way of
thinking, and it seems to me we should all be thinking about this
stuff...

"No one shall expel us from the Paradise that Cantor has created."
David Hilbert

Now there's academic approval for you. Kind of late for Cantor himself--was
he dead by then or just living the rest of his life without the creativity
he brought to the transfinite and set theory more generally?

Then Godel used Cantor's methods in a yet deeper approach to the foundations
of mathematics. He enumerated all possible mathematical truths and, using
Cantor's 'diagonal argument', showed the set to be uncountable, allowing him
to develop his 'incompleteness theorems'. He looked at systems of logic sort
of as contemporary writers look at writing/language sometimes, as systems of
material symbols and deduced some of the limits of such systems of
symbols/thought.

Then Turing used Godel's (and Cantor's) methods to put the last nail in the
coffin of Hilbert's paradise: he showed that it is not possible to devise a
general algorithm to decide the truth of any well-formed proposition of
mathematics. The 'decision problem', the Entscheidungsproblem. Yet it was
also Turing who devised the theory of the language/logic machine and
suspected it was sufficient to create thought itself. Thought circumscribed
by the limitations of systems of countably infinite combinatoriums of
language. "Cantor's Paradise" is still present there: all this work assumes
the countably, actually infinite, not merely the 'potentially infinite'. The
useful dividing line in language is not between the 'potentially' and the
'actually' infinite but between the countably and the uncountably infinite.

"The Paradise that Cantor has created" is rich enough to allow us to begin
to do the sort of 'meta-mathematics' that allows us to understand some of
the limitations of mathematics and logic. And to understand limitations not
always as simply deficits to be rectified but as lines drawn that provide
shape and form. The limits of a body give it visible shape.

So that it becomes possible to acknowledge limitations, even in notions of
God's power, do not so much diminish as give shape to what is rationally
possible in conceptions of the universe where there is yet room for the
infinite.

It has been quite encouraging to see the explosion of posts to Poetics on a
philosophy question, in a way. I think we all wonder, sometimes, whither
poetry. Perhaps we can tell our grandchildren that we lived in a time when
it may have looked like poetry disappeared, but actually what happened was
it underwent a deep transformation that saw it enter into very many
undertakings it had not been so present in before. So that, yes, in a sense
it partially disappeared, but it was sort of like its atoms were dispersed
into many other endevours, and informed these endevours with intense concern
about language, because notions of language were changing to be more
inclusive of types of language beyond the written word. And this spread of
concern about language into many other arts and other endevours was given
special impetus by the development of the computer because it is a language
and logic machine and represents whatever media or information it touches in
a whole range of types of languages--but yes, with language. So the poets
sometimes found themselves wondering if they were poets anymore or something
else. And some of the visual artists or musicians or even programmers,
mathematicians, logicians and philosophers wondered whether they were these
things anymore or had become poets.

Hello, all!

This is Andy Gricevich, habitual lurker and regular reader.

Many subscribers to this list would be likely, I think, to enjoy the work of THE NONSENSE COMPANY, a trio (of which I'm a member) performing original experimental theater and chamber music focusing on what seem to us to be crucial (and unanswered) social and political questions and problems, and taking special account of questions of language raised by contemporary poetry.

Within the next month, we're performing in two Fringe theater festivals in towns where no-one knows who we are: Des Moines and Minneapolis. If any of you
are in those towns, or know people there who might be interested in what we do, I'm sure we can use the audience... and I think these are important pieces that need to be seen.

We'll be performing three works by Company member Rick Burkhardt:

In Des Moines, Thurs. 7/20-Sun. 7/23, we'll perform "The Climb Up Mount Chimborazo," a 90-minute meditation on the relationship between Simon Bolivar, liberator of South America, and his tutor, Don Simon Robinson. Historical and contemporary materials are interwoven in a variety of ways to produce a fugal investigation of the writing and erasure of history, by turns tender and angry, straightforward and nearly hermetic, funny and mournful, and many places in between. Interactions between characters are accompanied by simultaneously performed texts (their phonemes spread between the three performers) from other periods, derailed by reflections on the process of acting, and interrupted by historical and contemporary references (the work of scientist-explorers, current events in Venezuela and Bolivia, critiques of sexism & heterosexism in narrative, advertising, sex education), a right-wing talk show performed by animal puppets, and a litany of battles in the form of a dense
 poetic monologue woven from the works of Whitman, Zukofsky, Ginsberg, Kipling and Galeano. More information (inlcuding a full script) is at http://www.princemyshkins.com/chimborazopage.html,
and a full schedule is at http://www.iowafringe.com.

In Minneapolis, August 3-7, we'll perform two works:
"Great Hymn of Thanksgiving," a piece for three virtuoso speaking percussionists around a dinner table setup, in which "the sounds of conversation have been replaced by fragments of news reports      from Iraq, scraps from the Army prayer manual, invented Arab folk tales, and      a recurring State of Emergency pointing everywhere and leading nowhere. The      sounds of the table itself struggle to bring this “conversation”      into a confrontation with material reality. The piece is a trio between the functions of music, noise, and semantic meaning,      wherein each function can mingle with the others, lose itself in reveries      (under fields of motive force that assert themselves with varying degrees      of insistence), or, when necessary, take a solo" (composer's note).
and
"Conversation Storm," in which three friends from three sides of the political spectrum argue about torture via a hypothetical "ticking time bomb" scenario, brutalizing their own positions in the process. The disastrous consequences of this argument are reflected back on the mechanisms of theater itself, raising the question of how one can write a play about torture without rationalizing it--even in opposing it.
The schedule and other information is at http://www.fringefestival.org.

Hope this sparks curiosity.

all the best,

This is merely redefining the word "facts" to mean "an utterance" or
"a statement" or "a proposition" or the like in order to speak about
"facts" as if they were solely artifacts of language. But to do so is
in fact to deny the ordinary use of the word "facts", which is used
to talk about that which Johnson kicked in refuting Berkeley. It's a
semantic trick, a rhetorical game, merely -- it is not a refinement,
it's a shuffle.

We're having this discussion here. One of the folks here declared
there are "no facts", that there is only language. I quoted him twice
to show you where to look. If his view is wrong, in your view, it
seems to me you should be trying to correct HIM, not shoot the
messenger who pointed out what you must think of as the error. Your
beef is with HIM, not me -- at least, not yet with me. State your
view of it better, and we'll talk about your view of it rather than
his. But until you do, you're pretty much stuck with his Berkeleyan
statement of the antifoundationalist view, and my Johnsonian
refutation of it.

> ... There are indeed several species of fact -- and let us not forget Norman Mailer's identification of its close cousin, the factoid <<

Then you must carefully indicated which species of fact you are
referring to in each use of the word "fact" or you'll be in danger of
equivocating, either on purpose or by accident.

The danger here is in talking nonsense about what "grasping" means in
all these metaphorical or connotational senses without reference to
what it means to grasp a spoon. If you watch a kitten or a child
progressively solving the problems of locomotion and grasping,
without language, you can see why antifoundationalism looks so
absurd. It's an attempt to so completely abstract how we talk about
things from the things we talk about that how we talk about things is
what is said to be "real" or "the facts" while pretending that the
things themselves are irrelevant.

But they're not irrelevant, they're hippopotomasus!

 The Hippopotamus Song
Flanders & Swann

A bold Hippopotamus was standing one day
On the banks of the cool Swhalimar
He gazed at the bottom as it peacefully lay
By the light of the evening star
Away on a hilltop, sat combing her hair
Was a fair Hippopotami maid
The Hippopotamus was no ignoramus
And snag her this sweet serenade:

'Mud, Mud, glorious mud
Nothing quite like it for cooling the blood
So follow me, follow
Down to the hollow
And there let us wallow in glorious mud'

The fair Hippopotama he aimed to entice
From her seat on that hilltop above
As she hadn't got a Ma to give her advice
Came tiptoeing down to her love.
Like thunder the forestry echoed the sound
Of the song that they sang when they met
His inamorata adjusted her garter
And lifted her voice in duet.

 'Mud, Mud, glorious mud
Nothing quite like it for cooling the blood
So follow me, follow
Down to the hollow
And there let us wallow in glorious mud'

The bold Hippopotami began to convene
On the banks of that river so wide
I wonder, now, what am I to say of the scene
That ensued by the Shalimar side?
They dived all at once, with an ear-splitting splosh
Then rose to the surface again
A regular army
of Hippopotami
All singing this haunting refrain:

'Mud, Mud, glorious mud
Nothing quite like it for cooling the blood
So follow me, follow
Down to the hollow
And there let us wallow in glorious mud'

"God thinks" someone says. God is thinking?

And here is where we meet the problem of language:

God is thinking =3D God thinks (Action / is =3D verb of being / noun =3D ve=
rb)
God is thinking =3D God equals thinking (Equation / is =3D equates / noun =
=3D noun)

It's really a problem of language more than anything else. And faith.

Does anyone know the English translation of an apparently Greek phrase
Robert Duncan uses in the Ground Work poem: Empedoklean Reveries?
It is in line 4 of the poem and looks something like:   nanal' eploes.

Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

The argument that there's something God can't do does not require God to
think. Because if God can't think, there's something God can't do.
Similarly, if God can't 'do', then there's something God can't do.

The only way I see out of the conclusion is to demolish logic and affirm, as
Amy King did, that "God can do something God can't do". Which is to say God
can do the logically impossible.

--------------------------

God can think of something God can't do.

If true, then there's something God can't do.

If false, then there's something God can't do: God can't think of something
God can't do.

So there's something God can't do.

There is a problem with all this the moment you say "god is" you have turned
God into an object or an analogy.

God is not an object,

God is.

Hassen,

I do not think we are saying the same thing. As an empiricist (or logical
positivist), Russell believed that any statement which was not either empirical
(both its truth and falsity possible, and a matter of "fact") or a priori
("necessarily," that is mathematically, axiomatically, not "factually," true) were
nonsensical. This assertion by Russell, by the standards of his own defintion,
is nonsensical, since the claim is not either empirical or necessary.

Is the word "nonsensical" a new category of speech (or "truth") or merely
deragatory? I think Russell and Logical Positivists meant it in a deragatory way.
In practice, after Wittgenstein, they are treating the term as a new
category, without quite acknowledging it. Assertions on language constitute a new
category, neither a priori (that's why language is not a closed system, like
mathematics) or factual (that's why, our discussions about God always gets trapped
in questions about language).

The difference between philosophical discussions about God and modern
theories of physics, astronomy, etal,. is that science still carries the "aura" of
the ability to predict (if still utterly true, I am not sure. I am not a
scientist). Did the Hubbel telescope predict the things it saw or only "explained"
them post observation. Does the string theory predict anything?

Another point: the valuing of prediction (in practice, technological prowess,
power) over moral coherence is an ideological choice. We see its
ramifications all around the world. In this context, "predictability and technology"
appear as "modern state," "democracy," "free enterprise," etc. God appears as
"asymmetrical" warfare.

Ciao,

Murat

Dear Postmodernists -

T.S. Eliot and Eugene O'Neill were both born in 1888. Coincidentally, both
of them died during the twentieth century.

Does anyone know what Eliot thought of O'Neill?  Does he mention him in any
important essays or other writings?

Jim,

Thank you for your beautiful, even lyrical, post. Could you elaborate for me
what is the distinction between countably and uncountably infinite? Not being
a mathematcian, I am not clear what that means.

Absolutely. Limit as definer, a positive, rather than a negative. Of course,
to me at least, the question remains: what does that shape exclude? Exclusion
itself a field of force.

Yes, human beings transformed from being defined as animals using "word
language" to animals using   a "hybrid machine language." Is that what you are
implying, though I am aware of the lure of your vision.

Does anyone know the English translation of an apparently Greek phrase=20
Robert Duncan uses in the Ground Work poem: Empedoklean Reveries?
It is in line 4 of the poem and looks something like:   nanal' eploes.

Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

It is foolhardy to think that this or any other movement can replace or
destroy the TV and the power that device wields.  But what this project can
do is subvert it.  We have been given the tools.  The very words that are
used to control people, to dictate their thoughts control their actions.  W=
e
will rewrite their history in our own way.  We will take their words and
re-envision them.  Take their rhetoric and make it our rhetoric.  We will
splice, deconstruct, montage, and mutate their messages to our own.  Let us
take their statements of politics, entertainment, fashion, etc=85and turn t=
hem
to our concepts. We have hundreds of channels of text waiting to be found,
to be rewritten.    Use their politics to offer up our own.  Take their
concept of art and make it ours. Make their sitcoms our comedies.  This
project is open to all who wish to mold this language of television into a
language of thought.  Your politics, aesthetics, and other beliefs are free
to be expressed. This is about community and bringing the community of poet=
s
together, no matter what school you are from. We are looking for a movement
to change the way poetry and TV is viewed.  All are welcomed to the
challenge of gaining control over the media that surrounds us.

*
*

*If you are interested please respond via email.
*

*
*

*
*

*Poor Man's TV Project*



The Mechanics:



Plop yourself down in front of our favorite babysitter.  Next randomly pick
15 channels.  From each channel write down the first phrase/sentence you
hear.  Repeat till you have done that with 15 channels.



Arrangement:



You can craft the poem in any style you wish.  The only restriction is all
the words must come from the 15 lines of dialog from the above step.



Refinement:



Depending on how many are involved in the final project will determine this
step.  Thanks to the internet we can divide everyone into groups.  Each
group will be responsible for the workshoping of each other in that group.
For those in a relatively close geographic region, you might want to set up
some type of face to face workshop to help polish these poems.  The
tentative schedule will be twice a month for these workshops.  The editors
will also ask that after each workshop a copy of the poems will be sent to
us so that we can see how everything is progressing.  Part of this project
is not only the finished poems but the process of crafting them as well.




The finished project:



The goal is to have a decent anthology of these poems ready by the end of
the year.  After that we shall begin to shop this project around.



Other Fun Socialization:



So that we will all have a stable and centralized site for all things Poor
Man's TV as well as other poetic things of note; the editors will be settin=
g
up an online site (Myspace, Yahoo, or something similar) so that all of
those involved can keep in contact throughout and beyond this project. Also
any other suggestions to make this run smoothly let us know.  Until these
other ideas or up and running we will be using mass emails to get any
important information out to the participants.  The editors contact
information is below.

neither Russell nor Wittgenstein were positivists, logical or otherwise. positivism is the believe that metaphysical propositions are all false because they reference entities that do not exist, or put another way, that metaphysical claims use linguistic slight of hand to talk into existence things like god and the will that don't really exist.

Russell had no objection to metaphysics, as can be seen in his theory of types and pretty much everything he ever said about mathematics or the theory of knowledge. At the same time he was not strictly an empiricist although he agreed with the prominence afforded to empirical science. Russell held that knowledge came through acquaintance with self-evident truths, such as the principles of deduction or the correspondence theory of truth. There's a big place for sense data in Russell's formulation, he criticizes the supremacy given to sense data in traditional empiricist views of knowleges.

I don't follow your assertions about Russell here. The idea of nonsense doesn't become really important for Wittgenstein until the Brown Book, and the bigger deal for the logical positivists was that some statements weren't verifiable and were therefore nonsense. That is, if a proposition cannot be verified by means of scientific investigation, then it is nonsensical. Russell believed no such thing, and such a view is riddled with problems, not the least of which the fact that verification is subject to the problem of induction, which Russell was aware of. It's this trouble with logical positivism, as well as the fact that it rejected everything from the realm of knowledge that wasn't empirical science including ethics and political theory, that led to the widespread rejection of logical positivism in place of various Russell/Moore/Wittgenstein derived theories at mid-century.

Rusell's views about God are of course complicated and difficult to form a coherent picture of. One must remember that for about fifty years of his life Russell wrote primarily for a popular audience and grossly simplified a number of his more complex and esoteric views in order that they be understood by a philosophically unsophisticated reader. That's why you get the relatively weird ideas about God in essay's like "Why I am Not A Christian" which doesn't really seem to jibe with the careful and methodical thinker that Russell was in his philosophy.

Wittgenstein is an even stranger case. Far from asserting that Metaphysical statements were empty because they referred to non-existent objects, Uncle ludwig's idea of sense and nonsense and the nature of meaningfulness is complex and defies easy aphorisization, despite the fact the he repeatedly try to express himself in such a way. At root, Wittgenstein held that what he called "the mystical" was the most important aspect of human life and that the great irony of our existence is that there is no way to talk about such things as absolute good, god, or the will in a way that has any sense. That is, the meanings of the sentences you make about those things collapse because they have no public grounds. Far from the empirical rejection that the positivists saw, wittgenstein correctly perceived this as a grammatical trouble with the way language works, and suggested as therapy that we simply
stop trying to talk about such things when they frustrate or upset us, but also pointed out at times that running up against the limits of language is a noble thing and that he admired and said that he would never try to dissuade someone from doing so. I think he just figured it would be better to do so realizing the futility of it than to do it thinking one was actually saying something meaningful and profound.

Actually, looks like it's spelled

Chi alpha chi alpha iota  [first word]

(that mark for aspirated sound) then epsilon rho iota delta epsilon sigma
[second word]

With accented iota in first word (going opposite direction for "acute"
accent in French) &
Accent (acute in this case) right after the aspirant mark over the epsilon
that begins the second word. . .

If that's any help.

Don't know how to access my greek keyboard.

I just received this very sad news about Malachi Thmpson -- a wonderful composer
and trumpet player who was a great friend to poets -- recorded with many of
them over the years -- I will imagine him somewhere playing his great "Ali
Shuffle" --

Malachi Thompson 1949-2006
Delmark Records has very sad news to report as our long time
Delmark family friend and musician, Malachi Thompson,
passed away yesterday morning at home,  July 16th, 2006.

Malachi (1949-2006) was a beautiful soul and an extremely
kind man and will be dearly missed by so many people whose
lives he has positively touched. Malachi was a brilliant trumpet
player and composer, writer and jazz historian, and a highly
influential advocate for jazz and arts education.

As part of the 2nd generation of AACM,  Malachi Thompson is
best known for his innovative approach in combining free jazz
with the discipline of bop and the emotion of the blues. Malachi
sadly passed away from leukemia, which had been in remission
for almost 20 years.  Just like his main musical heroes, Coltrane
and Lester Bowie, Malachi was more than a musician, but a
musician with vision and purpose.

Malachi's Africa Brass with Billy Harper will be performing in a tribute to
Malachi Thompson at the world famous Chicago Jazz Festival on Friday,
Sept 1 from 6-7pm at the Petrillo Main Stage.  This will be a special tribute
and very moving performance.  I know Malachi was looking forward greatly to
this anticipated event.

are bewildered, turn wild, or dwell like Robin Hood, outlawed and at

That's a way of putting it.
As I said long ago, all this philosophical language is only
illustrative of human
limitation. God is far superior to human beings. Their language may
confine him
but he lives in some state far beyond human language and logic. This
whole
thread has been a demonstration of human limitation.

Again, I  encourage a reading--or rereading as the case may be--of Pascal's
"The Wager"--
For an eight year period before his turn to rleigion, Pascal one of the
leading mathematicians scientists and inventors of his time.  A number of
his probablity theorems still in use.
"The Wager"  in other words, as he argues, is "a good bet"--

Thanks, Murat. It's quite a story, really, how Cantor's work is used by
Godel and Turing. And it's a story with deep relevance concerning
epistemology and language. But I'll just post here on the distinction
between the countably and the uncountably infinite.

First, we note that there are two ways to compare the size of two
collections of things. We can count the number of things in each collection
and compare the resulting two numbers, or we can do it without counting the
number of things in each collection. How? See if the elements of the
collections can be paired off with one another. For instance, if we compare
the collection {a,b,c} with {d,e,f} we can pair the two sets off:

a -> d
b -> e
c -> f

So, without counting the number of things in either collection, we can
nonetheless compare the size of the two collections.

By definition, the set of 'natural numbers' A={1,2,3,...} is 'countably
infinite'. Any set that can be put in one-to-one correspondence with (or, in
other words, 'completely paired off with') this set is also 'countably
infinite'. For instance, the set of even 'natural numbers' B={2,4,6,...} is
'countably infinite':

A    B
1 -> 2
2 -> 4
3 -> 6
.    .
.    .
.    .

via the function f(x)=2x. In the above little diagram, any element of A
appears in the left column, and any element of B appears in the right
column. Which is to say the two sets can be put in 'one-to-one
correspondence' or, in other words, the elements of the two sets can be
'paired off' in such a way that each element of each set is part of a pair;
5 is paired with 10, for instance.

So apparently the two sets are 'of the same size' or are, in technical
lingo, 'equivalent'. This is slightly surprising, given that the set of even
counting numbers is a proper subset of the set of counting numbers. But we
are dealing with countably infinite sets.

As it turns out, the set of positive rational numbers is also 'countably
infinite'. Recall that a 'rational number' is one that can be expressed as
a/b where a and b are counting numbers. There is a little proof of this fact
at http://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/rational-numbers-countable.php

This is somewhat surprising because the set of rational numbers is
apparently much larger than the set of natural numbers. We can see this by
noting that there are infinitely many rational numbers between 1 and 2.

At this point, we might conjecture that *any* two infinite sets are
countable. But this is not true. There are sets so large that they are not
countable. That this is so is explained quite well at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor's_diagonal_argument . Here we see
Cantor's famous proof that the set of all possible sequences of zeros and
ones is uncountable.

Why does this turn out to be of significance concerning epistemology?

Well, in a nutshell, it's possible to prove, for instance, that each of the
propositions deducible from the axioms of set theory is expressible as a
finitely long string of symbols, and that the collection of all deducible
propositions is countable. But it is also possible to use Cantor's diagonal
argument to show that there exist, nonetheless, true propositions that are
not deducible from the axioms of set theory. And that, more generally,
however rich the set of axioms is, there will always exist true propositions
not deducible from the axioms. Which is to say the basis of our knowledge is
always 'incomplete'.

But "incomplete" does not mean "there are no facts" or that "language
is all there is".

indeed. moreover, it's not even true that all axiomatic systems are incomplete. Axiomatized Euclidean geometry is provably complete, as are various axiomatizations of first order sentential and predicate logics. As a matter of fact that there are true arithmetic propositions which we can't deduce from first principles in arithmetic has always struck me as being sort of trivial. Godel's results about the consistency of mathematical systems and by extension rigorous formal language are much more interesting.

But since the issue at hand is whether there "are no facts" and
whether "language is all there is", it's hard to see why the
interesting notions about consistency in mathematical systems and by
extension rigorous formal language are relevant. To speak of these
notions as if the question of whether there "are no facts" or
"languages is all there is" has been settled is to beg the question.

Yeah, Tom, I was wondering about that aspirate mark over erides (is that

they all died terribly, hanging from trees." Lunchmeat, soapings, and
Batman. College when the body hair sprang. He started The Shattered Wig

**music**

"Old Songs (Mark Jickling and Chris Mason) have been translating archaic
Greek poetry from 7th to 4th centuries B.C. and putting them to old-timey
folk music. They have put out several CD's with songs by Sappho, Hipponax,
Alcman, Archilochus, and others. "Concerned with love, the afterlife,
dreams, and wishful thinking, Mason and Jickling's translations turn the
Greek into Smithsonian Folkways snapshots, offering a view of ancient Greec=
e
as earthy, rustic, and lived-in."

Mark Jickling was born in Chicago on the day that Muddy Waters recorded
Still A Fool.=20

Exactly, what is the difference between calling an activity nonsensical or a=
=20
noble failure?

In other words, does language in any given moment contain only the uses in=20
its past or also in its future? If the second, it is not a jail any more. If=
=20
only the first, as a close system, can never change, which obviously is not=20=
true.=20
I think the idea of "change" is the key issue in Wittgenstein?

Did he see statements on language as statements on a close system or not. If=
=20
so, to me, finally he is an empiricist. If not, then assertions about langua=
ge=20
constitute a third kind of statement, neither a priori nor empirical; rather=
,=20
"metaphysical."

Ciao,

Murat"

I've put a few new videos up on Free Space Comix:



http://www.arras.net/fscIII/?p=138



Popahna. 2004. 11:25 mins. 20.7 mb. With Tyler Carter, Popahna Brandes,
Natalia Stefans. Music by Leos Janacek, Public Image Ltd., L Voag. A short
drama shot in Providence in a low-tech "Alphaville" style charting the
adventures of a protagonist, "The Flaneur," as he seeks to take down the Ice
Queen, "Popahna," who weaves her magic from a hideaway known as the
"Arcade." In the meantime, other secrets of their relationship are revealed.
In German with subtitles.



Self Portrait as the Shroud of Turin. 2004. 3:42 mins. 2.7 mb. Depending on
your mood, this is either four minutes of me noodling around in my room or a
profound exploration of what it must be like shooting mini-DV video after
death by overdose. For the martyr in all of us.



Sirius Returned. 2004. 2:58 mins. 3.7 mb. Starring Durango. Inspired by Stan
Brakhage's short film, Sirius Remembered, which centered around the remains
of his dog that he discovered in the woods around his home (shot in
extremely short bursts of a few frames as was his technique), this short
experimental video is completely unedited, but has been reshot in reverse
through the viewfinder of another camera. I think it's cool.



How Are Them Raviolis? 2004. 5:26 mins. 4.9 mb. With Kelli Auerbach, Brian
Kim Stefans. I class this as a "performance piece" but I'm not going to tell
you what the rules were, you just have to find out. Partly inspired by some
Vito Acconci videos I was looking at, or maybe William Wegman. The sound is
not so good, but it's worth listening to as I recreate the voices of my New
Jersey youth.



Mouths. 2004. 3:13 mins. 9.3 mb. With Brian Kim Stefans and brief
appearances by Rodrigo Toscano, Kim Rosenfield and others. Soundtrack
includes reading by Ed Sanders and a sound piece by Marcel Duchamp. This was
actually taped by Tim Davis, poet and photographer, in something like 2000
or so in a small bookstore in Williamsburg, but I reshot it in reverse
through another camera. Only very slightly edited toward the end. The
soundtrack is really funny if offensive.



There's Something About Barney. 2004. 3:35 mins. 3.7 mb. With Brian Kim
Stefans. Inspired by Alvin Lucier's "I Am Sitting In A Room," I recorded the
same monologe nine-times and progressively increased certain video and audio
filters. The monologue is really a scandalous attack on Barney the Dinosaur
that I had discovered on the web and re-edited. I created a Flash
telepromter to keep it all synched, but it got pretty sloppy anyway.



Here's a repost of the Kluge videos with brief descriptions:



http://www.arras.net/fscIII/?p=104



Vex 1. 2005. 2:08 mins. 29.1 mb. With Christian Nagler. Sound by Christof
Migone and Gregory Whitehead from their series "Cris-cris." Short vignette
in which our hero is plunged into a dream world of homoerotic doubles and
hellish fish.



Vex 4. 2005. 3:14 mins. 73.5 mb. With Christian Nagler, Michael Gizzi. Sound
by Christof Migone and Gregory Whitehead from their series "Cris-cris." More
conceptual than "Vex 1," utilizing found footage from the web. The poet
Michael Gizzi free associates while destroying a piece of toast as
revolution moves apace.



Vex 5. 2005. 1:09 mins. 25.9 mb. With Christian Nagler. Sound by Christof
Migone and Gregory Whitehead from their series "Cris-cris." This is the
crowd favorite.  Air balloons, hellish fish, lobsters.



Postscript. 2005. 1:56 mins. 26.7 mb. A sort of postscript to the "Vex"
series but not part of it. A fish has dreams also, in this case of the hell
of industrialization (via the synechdoche of tricycles). Well, probably not
worth reading into.



Manchurian Rainman. 2005. 6:19 mins. 86.5 mb. With Frank Sinatra, Laurence
Harvey. Two Japanese teenagers, one inflected with a mild case of autism,
discuss their addictions.



Ferrari Dogs. 2005. 45 secs. 29.5 mb. With Angelina Jolie. Music by
Morrissey. This one would make a good Skittles commercial. Our heroine makes
her escape through a dreamlike mountainscape pursued by the pet dog she just
can't do without. Love everywhere.

Subject: Re: philosophy question
  Jim,

  Thank you for the detailed response. I have saved your explanation of the
difference between the countably and the uncountably infinite.

  In mathematics proofs ahave always been elusive to me, but I have an
instinctual understanding of inherent philosophical issues, Lat night I
wrote a response to one of the posts on this thread (by whom I can not tell
at this moment, which I could not e-mail due to the strictures about the
number of posts in a single day. I am insering it here. What I say about the
issue of the "new," of change in Wittgenstein's view of language has a lot
to do with the idea of undeductiblity, of incompleteness. Be well:



    "At root, Wittgenstein held that what he called "the mystical" was the
most important aspect of human life and that the great irony of our
existence is that there is no way to talk about such things as absolute
good, god, or the will in a way that has any sense. That is, the meanings of
the sentences you make about those things collapse because they have no
public grounds. Far from the empirical rejection that the positivists saw,
wittgenstein correctly perceived this as a grammatical trouble with the way
language works, and suggested as therapy that we simply
    stop trying to talk about such things when they frustrate or upset us,
but also pointed out at times that running up against the limits of language
is a noble thing and that he admired and said that he would never try to
dissuade someone from doing so. I think he just figured it would be better
to do so realizing the futility of it than to do it thinking one was
actually saying something meaningful and profound."




  Exactly, what is the difference between calling an activity nonsensical or
a noble failure?

  In other words, does language in any given moment contain only the uses in
its past or also in its future? If the second, it is not a jail any more. If
only the first, as a close system, can never change, which obviously is not
true. I think the idea of "change" is the key issue in Wittgenstein?

  Did he see statements on language as statements on a close system or not.
If so, to me, finally he is an empiricist. If not, then assertions about
language constitute a third kind of statement, neither a priori nor
empirical; rather, "metaphysical."

  Ciao,

  Murat"




  Hi Murat,

  I confess I am not familiar with Wittgenstein's writing though I have
often read others talking about his ideas. It's interesting to google "Godel
Wittgenstein" (without the quotation marks). I get the impression that Godel
was way beyond Wittgenstein as an innovative and insightful logician.
Perhaps Wittgenstein was still mired in the brouhaha of controversy over the
'potentially infinite' versus the 'actually infinite'. Whereas Godel had
moved beyond that to use the methods of Cantor where the line between the
worldly and the otherworldly is more aptly situated between the countable
and the uncountable. Not really in the sense that this world necessarily
manifests the infinite but in the sense that mathematical logic can proceed
with relative consistency while assuming the existence of the actually
(countably) infinite.

  I think the work of Cantor, Godel, and Turing is an inspiration concerning
how far we can proceed without necessarily spouting nonsense on matters of
deep relevance to philosophy. And their work is more consequential than that
of Wittgenstein in mathematical logic. I know Wittgenstein is more widely
read than Godel or Turing.

  Also, I am under the impression that no one has effectively disproved my
little argument that there is something God can't do. I have tried to answer
serious questions about it seriously, and only Amy King's objection seems to
me to apply logic to the matter in a convincing way. But her rebuttal comes
at the expense of a reduction of the universe to chaos. "God can do
something God can't do" implies God can do the logically impossible. My
intuition is that we are free to take either side in this matter or to take
all alternatives with a grain of salt. The victories of my mathematical
heroes--Pythagoras, Archimedes, Eratosthenes, Euclid, Gauss, Newton,
Leibnitz, Cantor, Godel, and Turing--and many others--move me to reject
Amy's proposition; while the victories of my poet heroes move me to a
position with some appreciation of the depth of the irrational, the chaotic,
the myserious, the incomprehensible, the disordered, the accidental, the
random...

  Also, I am as conflicted as you concerning the weight natural language can
manage. But I think the work of Cantor, Godel, and Turing is inspirational
in this regard.

  There's some interesting speculation at
http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/goldstein05/goldstein05_index.html by
Rebecca Goldstein concerning Godel's views on Wittgenstein (search for
"Wittgenstein"). But I'm under the impression that Godel's Platonism was
something he struggled with more earnestly in his productive years and gave
in to in his later years. The poor man did go a bit loon later on (so did
Cantor and Turing committed suicide by eating a poisoned apple). Godel
starved himself to death because he feared his food was being poisoned. I
remember Martin Davis, in his fabulous book "Engines of Logic" quotes
Godel's having said something like 'Platonism is not a viable philosophical
position' in the years of his productive work. But it's true, at least later
on, that he came to believe very deeply in Platonism. There's an interesting
review by John Martin of "Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt
Gödel" by Rebecca Goldstein at
http://www.maa.org/reviews/GoldsteinIncompleteness.html

  See I think that we are capable of the sort of profound insight that
Cantor, Godel and Turing came back with. And these insights were *both*
about limitations and really forward-looking possibilities that continue to
influence not only theoretical work but even things like the rise of the
language machine.

What you say is true, but perhaps it is confusing to some, because you use
the word 'complete' in valid ways that reveal something of its complexity.
As you know, "In mathematical logic, a system is 'complete' if it contains
either S or ~S for every sentence S generatable in the system's language"
(from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete ). As we read at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry in the section titled
"Logical Status", the systems to which you refer are complete only because
the languages they express are not sufficiently rich for Godel's theorem to
apply to them. In other words, they are complete only because the range of
truths they can express is not as great as 'even' that of arithmetic. The
validity of Godel's results, as you know, depends on the systems/languages
being sufficiently rich.

Well, I agree that it is somewhat 'intuitive' that there will always be
truths that are not discoverable from our assumptions. But, given the
history of this issue, I don't agree it can accurately be described as
"trivial". It seems to me that this understanding was probably important to
Turing's solving the Entscheidungsproblem (the 'decision problem' at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem ), for instance, and the
Entscheidungsproblem was listed by Hilbert as one of the great unsolved
mathematical problems of its time.

Also, before its publication, there were many people who felt we were only a
short time away from proving that there *could* exist an algorithm to decide
the truth of any proposition. But Godel's results tempered the age with some
humility concerning the limits of knowledge. And understanding such
limitations turned out to be very positive work in its also paving the way
for Turing's theory of the language machine (and understanding of its
limitations, albeit ones that do not preclude the possibility that thought
itself is computable).

Turing theorized the computer as a means to solve the Entscheidungsproblem;
he was more interested in solving that problem than inventing the computer.
And who wouldn't be? Gorgeous work.

Trust it, we're a great bunch of oddmusicians.  The gallery is mostly
focused on people who are members of the oddmusic mailing list or are
lesser known and is not meant to be comprehensive.  Partch's work is
well documented elsewhere.

how do you determine what odd poetry is? isn't this the kind of question
poets rattle their pencases over?

I (think I) know odd when I see it, but what's the verse equivalent of a
nanoguitar (http://www.oddmusic.com/gallery/om22000.html)??

Dear APR, it astounds me you would mention Ruth Stone and Robert Bly
on the cover of your May/June 2006 issue and NOT Anne Waldman.  Do  you
ACTUALLY believe, is it possible you sincerely believe Stone and Bly  could
be changing the world, and changing poetry more than Anne Waldman?
Your beige vision FRIGHTENS me!

And how about the latest issue, where you publish Rae Armantrout's  fantastic
"New Genres."  She is one of the most brilliant minds in American  poetry
today,
but is not mentioned on the cover.  Nor is her photograph even  included.
APR is
a sad case for alerting the rest of the world what America has to  offer.
When I hear
the French and Germans complain that American poetry is boring I blame you
and
your ridiculous magazine!  And I find myself having to do damage  control to
PROVE
how wrong they are about American poetry, by proving how wrong YOU  are!

The ONLY reason I pick up APR at all is to open and find that ONE, or
sometimes
TWO truly brilliant minds filled with that molten, original fire that makes
poetry Poetry!

Stop giving American poetry such a terrible reputation!  Start putting  the
true geniuses
on your cover before you dare print and distribute.  Start  understanding
what's really
going on in poetry these days, something you are without a doubt out of
touch with.

ABSOLUTELY SICK OF YOU!

Murat and Jim,
I'm going to roll this response into one email, hope you don't mind.

Wittgenstein didn't see language as nearly that orderly and he would have balked at describing it as any kind of system at all. Rather, he used the model of the language-game to illustrate how language is arbitrary, irregular, publicly grounded, and highly contextual. From a higher order perspective Wittgenstein regularly allows for two kinds of grounds for sentences, grammar in his special sense of the word that includes issues of what linguistics usually calls semantics and pragmatics along with syntax, and empirical factors. But by empirical factors he allows also for imaginations, flights of fancy, dreams, and various things that are not considered hard aspects of the material world. Which is to say, when he's talking about empirical facts, he's talking about sense-data plus every other kind of personal experience with public criteria, and as such is quite different from a traditional
empiricist. Grammatical facts are facts about the way language is used and include such things as mathematics, logic, and less intuitively, things like anthropology, poetry, and music. Your question about closed and open systems and language change don't make a lot of sense. Wittgenstein never explicitly addressed language change as far as I can recall, but it presents no problems for his analysis. More importantly though, the fact of language change doesn't change the nature of things that can't be spoken of meaningfully, and the limits of language remain the limits of language.

If you're familiar at all with the work of Brouwer on the foundations of mathematics, or at all familiar with the ideas of the "intuitionist" school of mathematical logic, there's an analogy to be drawn between their work on the subject and Wittgensteins. I'll confess that set theoretic proofs and second order logic tends to make my head swim so it's hard for me to really get a handle on a lot that such mathematicians talk about. That having been said, I do know that Wittgenstein makes some very lucid and pointed criticism's about Cantor's diagonal proof in the second appendix to the notebooks published collectively as "Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics." The criticisms are directed not at the proof itself but rather at the logicism it inspired and at some of the claims about transfinite numbers and set theory that it purports to show. For Wittgenstein, extensions of mathematical principles
were interesting but overvalued and as grammatical statements, do not reveal anything about the nature of the world, but rather, only reveal things about the nature of mathematics. I generally don't care very much about the philosophy of mathematics so I don't follow it very closely, but since you're a Turing fan, you might be interested to know that Turing attended one of Wittgenstein's classes on the foundations of mathematics in the late thirties, and the two had lively ongoing debates that were written down verbatim but a couple of W's students who were in the habit of taking stenographer style notes at his lectures. The debates are published verbatim in the book entitled Wittgenstein's Lectures on the Philosophy of Mathematics and are a pretty good read. They will probably give you a better idea about Wittgenstein's Philosophy of Math than I could. As to your reference about his relevance
to mathematical logic, it's worth pointing out that Wittgenstein invented truth tables in the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, which, as I'm sure you know, are so widely used at this point that it's rare that professors point out to students that they even needed to be invented.

As for Wittgenstein on Godel, there's a lot of critique over Wittgenstein's supposed misunderstanding of Godel. I think such interpretations of Wittgenstein are more likely various readers misunderstanding of Uncle L than Uncle L's misunderstanding of contemporary issues in mathematical logic. After all, at one point Russell considered Wittgenstein his natural heir and the person most likely to move forward from the Principia Mathematica to finally solve once and for all the problems facing logicism. That Wittgenstein abandoned such a notion as empty long before Godel published his proofs of the Incompleteness theorems I think goes a long way towards showing how sophisticated a mathematical think Uncle Ludwig was. There's a paper by Hilary Putnam, who I regard as a very nuanced and interesting reader of W, about a lot of these issues that's worth reading: staff.washington.edu/dalexand/ Putnam%20Readings/Notorious.pdf

As far as this goes there are two problems which you haven't really addressed.

The first is the red herring argument I brought up initially. That is, no one seriously makes the claim that God can do anything, so to say God can think of something that God can't do is uncontroversial and so your argument that "if God can't think of something God can't do, then there is something God can't do" is empty. See theologians as far back as St. Augustine for illustrations of what is and is not asserted about the nature of divine power.

The second is much more difficult, and is entailed by the fact that "God" is not a sensibly predicable subject because there are no public grounds on which to determine whether predicates about God are true or false. That is to say, I can say "God looked like an enormous yellow halibut smoking a cigar when he created the world, but he started looking more like Cary Grant by the time he got around to creating the animals." and that has the same grammatical status as "God can think of something that God can't do." which is that both sentences are meaningless because they predicate to a subject which in symbolic logic might be expressed as VxGx, where A is god that should you substitute A for x, the truth or falsity of the statement becomes indeterminate.

Jim,

The key expression for me here is "public criteria." What does it exactly
mean? Does it mean that the public criteria (is it different from usage?) is the
"personal experience"? For instance, when I say I dreamt something, is that
reporting the dreaming (dream?) itself?

Could you explain to me how past usage determines the public criteria of a
previously non-existent usage?

We circle back to the same issue "can't be spoken of meaninfully" (public
criteria). "The limits of language remain the limits of language" is an
interesting tautology. Outside mathematics, this is a flesh and blood (political and
moral) issue. With this "fact," do we roll over and go to sleep? Or do we rattle
the cage and conceive of a space beyond. That is the question I am asking,
both of us and questioning Wittgenstein's attitude.

Hello Diane,

Yes, kakai erides is nominative plural.  It certainly does sound like something from Hesiod, as well as something from Duncan.  I have browsed through my Loeb Hesiod, but I haven't found the relevant passage yet.

In any case, welcome to the Poetics list from an old friend who spent some time with you in your lovely workshops during the 70's.  Now I am a this list's solitary Sanskritist, among other things.

Hi George,

I'm guessing that since the poem is Empedoklean Reveries, or some such
title, that the phrase may well be in Empedocles. However, have not had a
chance to go digging for my bilingual pre-Socratics down in the garage
bookshelves Kirk & Raven was it? & one other. If you have same, you may well
find the very phrase.

Glad you've "got" Sanskrit. I took a year of it in the 70s, but haven't kept
it up at all.

Best,  Diane di P.

Yes, I'm somewhat familiar with the outline of the 'intuitionist' or
'constructivist' approach. Though there are mathematicians and logicians who
still find it useful, Cantor's ideas are far more prevalent in the world of
mathematics now than those of constructivism mainly because the
constructivist/finitistic limitations imposed by constructivism crippled the
program's ability to develop many of the more important results in various
fields of mathematics where, it turns out, assuming the existence of the
actually infinite is crucial; any viable philosophy of the foundations of
mathematics must either be capable of justifying the important work already
done or offering compelling alternative results, and 'constructivism' has
apparently done neither with sufficient force to 'win the battle' but has
done enough to still exist. Also, the development of the theory of
computation has been immensely successful and influential not only within
mathematics but in its technological consequences.

Also, what I've encountered of constructivism was always plodding whereas
when you study Cantor or Godel, you must be impressed with the beauty of the
results established within proofs whose methods are not only breathtakingly
clever and succinct but have supplied succeeding generations with methods
that continue to be useful.

I wonder if Wittgenstein could have understood, at that time, the importance
of Turing's results not only in mathematics but in the world via computing.

The relation between the sort of inquiry Godel and Turing carried out into
the foundations of mathematics and the theorizing of the computer arises out
of the need of the foundations of mathematics for theoretical 'engines of
logic' that can be used in problems such as the 'decision problem' where the
question is whether an algorithm that does so-and-so can exist.

By the way, Jason, if you haven't read Martin Davis's book 'Engines of
Logic', give yourself a treat and pick it up. A really fine book.

Truth tables are very useful. They make plodding more bearable.

Yes, I saw that in my google of "Godel Wittgenstein". It's a very difficult
read.

In the above you concede the truth of the conclusion that there is something
God can't do, describe the conclusion as "uncontroversial", and use that as
a basis to assert that the argument that leads to the conclusion is "empty".

X can think of something X can't do.

Trivial cases:
1. X can't think. In this case, there is something X can't do (e.g. think)
so the conclusion (There is something X can't do) is true.
2. X can't 'do'. Again, there is something X can't do (e.g. do anything) and
so the conclusion (There is something X can't do) is true.

The non-trivial case is where X can think and X can 'do'. In this case, if
"X can think of something X can't do" is true, the conclusion obviously
follows, and if "X can think of something X can't do" is false, then it's
true that "X can't think of something X can't do", in which case, once
again, there is something X can't do.

So in all cases, regardless of the nature of X, the conclusion that "There
is something X can't do" follows--regardless of whether there are "public
grounds on which to determine whether predicates about God are true or
false."

Diane, I think you're right about the phrase coming from Empedocles, not
Hesiod -- the Perseus site is working today, and I was able to search
for instances of "Eris" in the Hesiodic corpus:=20

us:te
xt:1999.01.0131&lang=3Dgreek&group=3Dbilevel

(they don't have the Empedocles text up there, so we have to rely on
print)

is there a study of classical language use (incl. Sanskrit, I guess) in
Modern & later 20th-c. poetry? would be interesting to see something
like that... I know of a set of foreign language concordances for
Finnegans Wake, but that's about it.

how much Sanskrit/Vedic content is there in Duncan, by the way? how does
he use it?

Hi George,

I'm guessing that since the poem is Empedoklean Reveries, or some such
title, that the phrase may well be in Empedocles. However, have not had
a
chance to go digging for my bilingual pre-Socratics down in the garage
bookshelves Kirk & Raven was it? & one other. If you have same, you may
well
find the very phrase.

Glad you've "got" Sanskrit. I took a year of it in the 70s, but haven't
kept
it up at all.=20

true vern  hey i hope you enjoyed the book

anyway
today the bastard (gd)
almost
made me shit in my pants
i had to walk a mile to find a toilet
past all sorts of vermin both human and not
and the trash (mostly human)
that such vermin leave behind
then i scratched my foot on barbed wire
then found a big dead turtle
and actually intoned
"the lord giveth - the lord taketh away"
& crossed myself
pretty weird behavior for an agnostic jew
who always curses gd out
whenever things go wrong
which is pretty often
but never thanks "HIM"
when things go right
since i don't really know if gd exists
cause the signs i've been shown
all point to the contrary
or are too fked up
or just not good enough or pass in a fleeting instance
any way my wife says gd is a dimwit
oh what else ah now i've forgotten

well the other day at this picnic
at lake sebago
(felt like i was in a foreign country)
this gorgeous statuesque dancer i know
had the words "i am my lord i am"
tatooed across her belly
right above her belly button
i told her the infinite possibilities & combinations
that "sentence" held
she said that must be because you are a poet
tho she herself didn't seem to grasp what the words meant
what do the words mean?
&does any one out there know where they come from?

Hi Tom,

I'm not aware of any Sanskrit references in Duncan--don't believe that was
his cup of tea. He eschewed the "mystical" per se, stuck to the Greek and
such like.

On the other hand, Charles Olson was deeply interested in Sanskrit works
toward the end of his life: not Vedas, but Hindu Tantra: John Woodruffe's
(Arthur Avalon) "Hymns to the Goddess", etc. --- But that's another story.

Best,

Diane

This is pure speculation because like I said, phil of math isn't something I care enough about to really be up on, but my guess is that wittgenstein would say that the application of logic engines is rather trivial. he felt that mathematics could be extended in whatever way they needed to be in order to apply them to whatever someone needed to do. What he objected to were not the physical application, or even the truth of various extensions of the language of mathematics, except when the semantics of proofs like the incompleteness theorem or the existence of transfinite numbers were argued to have metaphysical implications, because once mathematicians start talking about metaphysics, they're no longer in the realm of mathematics, and are beyond the point where they have grounds to speak.

Right, because it defuses one of your premises that's necessary to get the paradox to happen, namely, that God can do anything. Without that proposition all you're saying is God can think of something God can't do, therefore there is something god can't do. Which is no argument at all. it's just If P then P and doesnt' show anything about anything.

Sure, if you are dealing with a sensible subject that is predicable. What i'm saying is you can't substitute the word God for the variable X given the general sorts of sentences in which the word God is used. I might even object to the idea that God is a name in the same way that my name is jason, again because there are no publicly available criteria for determining if whatever thing I call God is really the same thing you call God, hence, it's not a real proper name. It's all well and good to, in isolation from the pragmatics of the word, say that what the word God means is some definition D, but no such definition is going to capture the meaning of the word. "God" is a paradigm case where meaning is use, and to extract the word from it's ordinary usages, as a character in the story of the bible, as the addressee of prayer, as an invocation of fortune, etc, is to start in with philosopher's
nonsense and to not say anything meaningful. Because it's not a subject that is predicable int the same way that "my chair" "Jason Quackenbush" or even "Jesus of Nazareth" is.

i don't recall if anyone has cited this page:

http://www.stats.uwaterloo.ca/~cgsmall/ontology.html

but worth a look in light of this matter of godel vis-a-vis the
almighty... it discusses godel's mysticism (described as a variety of
neo-platonism)... i think it would be correct to say that godel
generally uses logic against itself, as it were---to prove that logic
is not sufficient to describing (e.g.) numbers... in which regard,
perhaps, you see a corresponding (?) drift from the wittgenstein of
the ~tractatus~ to the later witt of ~phil. invest.~...

at any rate, what's always interesting to me about these discussions
is how we have to use language to get at what mathematicians (like
godel) have ultimately to prove in terms of mathematical
formulations... it's one thing to understand the logic of godel's
incompleteness theorem, for instance, in terms of language
statements... it's entirely another to grasp the mechanics of the
polynomial equation godel devised so that, for instance, one can
actually *know* a specific mathematical truth that godel's universal
truth machine (call it what you will) could not know...

i always feel, that is, that i come up shy b/c i have to get at such
things via language... for godel, this was not a point easily
dismissed, b/c he viewed numbers, at least as i understand him, to
possess a quality not exhausted by logico-philosophical analysis... i
would imagine that he and witt would have disagreed here at least, to
some extent...

somebody please correct me if i'm wrong...

also:  there's so much here that seems to have already enjoyed its
cultural-historical moment (via books by people like hofstadter) that
i wonder whether the exchange signals a desire to return to said
moment -- of course i continue to be fascinated myself by such stuff,
game theory, etc., but my educational background was originally in
mathematics (so, ahem, i have a good idea of how little i know) --
and whether its more masculine contours (i didn't say male, but i
could have, i suppose) are a measure also of some testicular import
(mea culpa)... not that this stuff dates, exactly, but our enthusiasm
for it might suggest some corresponding cultural marker, no?...

sorry, but figured i should float the gender question anyway... i'm
feeling very male - or is it masculine? - right now... and that's ok
too, i suppose...

best,

joe

"Trivial" in what sense? I doubt you mean to say that the invention of the
computer was trivial.

Also, concerning what is trivial and what isn't, 'everyone knows' that
conclusions drawn from natural language propositions are suspect. Some of
Godel's work consists of formalizing the proposition 'This proposition
cannot be proved' into a proposition that is well-formed in set theory; and
he proceeds to demonstrate that it is an 'undecidable' proposition. I think
that before he did this, the Wittgenstein influence may have been very
strong and dissuasive concerning the possibility that this could be done at
all.

Wittgenstein's influence seems to have largely cautionary. Whereas Godel's
work has time and again been characterized as the most important work in
mathematical logic in the twentieth century.

We get our inspirations and big ideas not by pushing symbols so much as in
natural language and in non-verbal experience. We have to be able to trust
that, or at least trust that we can actually make sense of it sometimes,
make poetry of it, make beautiful Godelian theorems of it, discover the
truth, etc. Godel's work is inspirational in that regard, I think.

Recall that Cantor's work was spat upon as trivial and contradictory for
quite a while because 'everybody knew' that assuming the existence of the
actually infinite leads to contradictions.

The Wittgensteinian version of such taboo urges us to shut up about subjects
he thinks can't be discussed sensibly.

But I think Cantor and Godel's work shows us it's often important to try to
press on in the face of criticism.

My feeling is that if logicians feel they can argue effectively and
truthfully concerning matters metaphysical, then they should do so.

Howdy List,

re: Hesiod and Duncan, that is actually Passages 22: You Muses.  Sorry
for the initial mis-lead re: Empedoklean Reveries.

re: Empedoklean Reveries-- it was influenced by a good friend of RD's
named Norman Austin, a classics scholar who wrote a book called
Archery at the Dark of the Moon.

I know Duncan was influenced by alternative spiritual traditions early
on (I mean, he started life as a Bakersfield theosophist, which should
be an oxymoron)... was he critical of these matters as he developed, or
did he always believe in the big cosmic What accessible through ritual
and digging deeper/reaching higher?

science of the Secrets)

Jim, i'm sorry, but you're missing my point here. Wittgenstein's arguments aren't cautionary tales but elucidations of impossibilities. He's not saying just that one shouldn't talk, or be careful about talking about certain things, he' showing that there are whole domains wherein it is impossible to say anything meaningful, the metaphysics of mathematics being one of those domains. Moreover, he takes aim specifically at the idea that what logicians and mathematicians do is make claims about the world. rather, logicians and mathematicians extend the grammar of language, that's it, and as such their work is trivial and has no metaphysical import or consequences. I think Uncle would have liked digital computers, but the idea of a machine carrying out an algorithm based on logical conditions, which is what computers are, isn't necessarily preceded by the metaphysical conclusions that formalists
like turing or realists like godel. In other words, Wittgenstein is a very complicated and deep thinker and his thought has very real consequences not for mathematics, but about the limits of what mathematics can say, and i think you'd really quite enjoy a lot of what he has to say on the subject. I'd start with the Tractatus and then read the Philosophical Investigations. Both books are highly rewarding.

Yes - I guess the question remains after we shut down on one side, how do we
not shut up on the other. The invasion of Lebanon - the demolition bombing
(yes, we have heard that word "precision" before in Iraq, etc.} is beyond
the pale. The clearly calculated destruction - in planning for the last year
- of a twenty mile swath of space of human communities with the subtext
provision that there are no (i.e. Arab) innocent inhabitants. All with USA
complicity - now Bush implicitly saying that this killer wipe out will bring
peace to the region (as certainly he has brought peace to Iraq. How to move
beyond being appalled? The more this goes on, the more likelihood, I assume,
of rockets into Tel Aviv. And then and then and then.

Yikes and then some,

exactly, never heard a journal shuts down (exactly for one month ???) to
protest against wars. I thought bridges were meant for commu(nica)ting
to places that were never quite reached.

Yeah, that exactly one month thing does look a mite suspicious, like
generating good will for going on vacation.

As to impact, since I don't know what Big Bridge is and I'm probably
more up on these things than anyone at whom the protest is presumably
aimed, this is pretty much a tree falling in the forest.

But in the spirit of solidarity, I'm not going to start up the web
page that I wouldn't have started up anyway for at least a month.

Tom Lewis suggested several things, including "ugly quarrels", which
fits the context of the poem. (Thank you Tom!) I wonder if there is a
friend of Duncan on this list who knows more about how Duncan's split
with Levertov over the Vietnam war affected his thinking. In letters to
her, it seems clear that he did not care for the direction Denise's
thoughts on the war took her life or her poetry. (He did not like poetry
"with a point" anyway.) In the cited poem, it seems clear that he
continued to move in a direction away from reaction and understood the
toxic nature of oppositional thinking.

37 days might have looked suspicious, also, being that it is not a round nu=
mber, and some say off numbers draw more suspicion than, say, a baked potat=
o in a swimsuit.

War, what's it good for? Silly shit, like, everyone bustin' on Michael 'cau=
se he chose to make a statement. No one's giving guff to all you shitheads =
who protest in your many, fashionable ways.

That's why war is so profitable. Why is war profitable? Because. Just becau=
se.

And that would be a non sequitur.

This is my loast allowable message for the day. It;s hard for me to
imagine that anyone not on the ground (or with loved-ones on the
ground) could feel more anguish about the situation in the Middle
East and the incredibly stupid role of the US in it. That said,
spinning one's wheels is spinning one's wheels. Horseshit, as Hal so
aptly put it.

Didn't say he "wasn't" a mystic -- however you define that.

Just said he verbally eschewed all such labels.

I find the following piece about as editorially equitable as sanity can
offer under present conditions.
It's a bit horrific to imagine C Rice showing up weekend to confirm that
this regional threat to Israel will, as much as possible, been completely
eliminated in the most concrete form imaginable.
In the same way that Iraq is a pyrrhic (disastrous) victory, one imagines
Israel getting somewhat similarly swallowed by plunging into a G war with
Hezbollah.=20

The Lebanon Blitz

By Alvaro Vargas Llosa
Special to washingtonpost.com
Friday, July 21, 2006; 12:00 AM


WASHINGTON -- Israel's pursuit of Hezbollah in Lebanon is a mistake. It is
unwittingly targeting the best hope of civilized life in the Middle East
(outside of Israel itself) and creating the kind of moral and institutional
vacuum that engenders sectarian violence.

As I traveled in Lebanon two weeks ago, four things struck me: the almost
miraculous reconstruction of Beirut; the free-thinking cosmopolitanism of
its middle class; the spirit of peaceful coexistence among the various
religious groups, thanks in part to the open-mindedness of much of the Sunn=
i
population; and the resentment against Hezbollah among Christians (who
comprise more than 35 of the population) and Muslims almost everywhere
except the Bekaa Valley and southern Lebanon.

Compared to any other Arab country, Lebanon was the closest thing to
paradise. Yes, Hezbollah's mighty presence was obvious as I drove around
Baalbek, in the east, and from Tyre to the border with Israel in the south,
where the Shiite population is concentrated. The yellow Hezbollah banners,
pictures of Hasan Nasrallah's bearded face or of the late Ayatollah Khomein=
i
indicated whose bastion I was in. And I heard Walid Jumblatt, one of the
leaders responsible for forcing Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon and a pilla=
r
of the parliamentary majority, express frustration with Hezbollah's
influence in the nation's politics.

But Lebanon was obviously making progress. Its legendary entrepreneurial
drive was back. Even with an economy not fully recovered from a civil war
that reduced the country's GDP by half, one sensed a spirit of optimism.
People were planning all sorts of personal projects -- an unmistakable sign
of civil society, whether it be opening new bars on Beirut's Monot Street
or, as Nada, an assistant working at a cultural institute, had just done,
persuading a publisher to start an imprint devoted to translations of
Spain's modern literature.

All of this progress has now been reduced to rubble. The infrastructure tha=
t
took billions of dollars to rebuild is being pulverized. The institutions
that managed to hold the internal peace are being blown away. The confident
embrace of the outside world is dissipating. An atmosphere is now emerging
in which civil society will shrink and extremists will thrive, as happened
between 1975 and 1990. The country will now be hostage to the ideological
and personal designs of power-hungry leaders. (As I write these words, I ge=
t
an e-mail from Nada: "... We are trapped. If Israel stops, the threat of
this happening again will hang over us forever because Hezbollah is still
strong. If they don't, we will be paying too high a price. ... They have
just bombed Byblos (a city in northern Lebanon) ... this is hell, we are
running out of fuel!")

It is true that Lebanon in transition had many problems, including the
political survival of many leaders who fought the war, a power-sharing
arrangement entirely based on religious grounds and, especially, the
incapacity of the political institutions to disarm Hezbollah. But Israel's
reprisals are not making that right. They are punishing a moderately
successful attempt at religious diversity in a climate of peaceful
coexistence and modernization in the Arab world.

Hezbollah is in part a creature of Israel's presence in Lebanon from 1982
until 2000. Unlike the civil society that is being bombed, Hezbollah is
trained in guerrilla fighting. And if things continue as they are, these
terrorists will now be handed a failed state in which they will make
themselves the only operative Lebanese force.

Few things can be more legitimate than defending oneself against the attack=
s
of an organization such as Hezbollah, whose cowardly rockets are aimed at
terrorizing the whole of the Galilee hills area in Israel, whose allies --
Iran and Syria -- are two of the worst human-right offenders in the history
of mankind, and whose ideology is simply barbaric. But Israel's response
places collective guilt on an entire society for the atrocities of a
minority of which that society is itself the victim.

Gideon Levy, an Israeli commentator, put it like this in an article
published in Haaretz: "Eight soldiers are killed and two abducted to
Lebanon? All of Lebanon will pay. ... The (army) absorbed two painful blows=
,
which were particularly humiliating, and in their wake went into a war that
is all about restoring its lost dignity, which on our side is called
'restoring deterrent capabilities.'"

It is hard to see how a nation that stands for moral rectitude and
civilization can win people over to its struggle for security by using mean=
s
that tarnish that very objective.

I agree with Maria's opinon that it is a powerful statement at Big Bridge's
website, closed for one month in protest against the outbreak of war between
Israel and Lebanon.  My tobacconist is Palestinian; my psychiatrist is Lebanese;
these are things I do to keep the peace.  I am glad that my short story up at
Big Bridge, written solely for entertainment purposes, a story about how
people must scramble to keep having sex during a hurricane that didn't even hit
Houston has been interrupted by war at this time.

I almost never agree with Halvard, but in this I agree whole-
heartedly.

Because liberals value engagement and communication, some na=EFve
liberals figure that they are punishing people when they disengage
and fall silent. What those na=EFve liberals fail to understand is that
the haters are happiest when the reasonable people who want to engage
and communicate fall silent. That's when the haters can do their best
work, unimpeded by the thought process.

Good work, Halvard.

Well, Wet Asphalt isn't shutting down, summer vacation or no. I think our articles about contemporary literature will have a much greater impact on international policy if we remain in the public eye rather than silencing ourselves in protest. I'm planning an article next week about Dana Gioia's impact as potentiometer supreme at the NEA. Here's hoping that the Hazbollah guerillas and israeli military really take it to heart and decide to initiate peace talks.

in other recent wetasphalt articles:

*A very long interview with the talented women behind One Story magazine.

*A link and comment on 1.) a very good essay by Tom Bissell, and 2.) a very weird interview with Neil Stephenson

*Columns about how bad Superman Returns is and the strange fact that Jin Yong, one of the most popular writers in the world, is virtually unpublished in English.

*A long rambling essay by yours truly in support of reading poetry silently and the connection between subvocalization, dialect, and the myth of regularity in poetic meter.

All very entertaining and very free of charge on the internet:

It is hoped that through the crass self-promotion entailed by our staying open in protest that the various adherents abrahamic religions will finally set aside their differences, tribal disputes, and worship of mammon and realize that what really matters is that someone buys my novel before i turn thirty in a couple of years. That way the press can characterize me as a wunderkind rather than continually writing about various international factions such as the lebanese, the US, and israel as variously: "terrorists" "bullies" "murderers" and "greedy whores." I am in fact a terrorist a bully a murderer and most especially a greedy whore, and I'm certain that the international press' time and energy would be much better spent talking about me and my writing than all of this war stuff. To that end, I work now to further my own career and to establish some modicum of literary "celebrity" only in the interests of peace in the middle east.

thanks for helping in this noble effor by reading this email.

37 days might have looked suspicious, also, being that it is not a round

potato in a swimsuit.

War, what's it good for? Silly shit, like, everyone bustin' on Michael

rob mclennan is never far from poetry action in Ottawa. Nomados is pleased
to announce

PERTH FLOWERS by ROB MCLENNAN. 26 pp ISBN 0-9781072-0-7 @ $8.00 (rob
mclennan is one of the best contemporary poets in Canada. His eyes are wide
open to the content of the world and its flux that we immediately need to
recognize.    Barry McKinnon)

OTHER NOMADOS BOOKS

CREPUSCULE ON MISSION STREET by AARON PECK 27 pp ISBN 0-9781072-0-9

@ $8.00  (With all the seductive charm of well-told gossip, this unfolding
conversation draws us deep into the mysteries of the current day - money,
art, fakery, friendship - even as it skates across the great separating
distances of living, a jet plane making serial hops in the course of a long
circuitous day. This is magical, compact writing that nevertheless exudes
the marvelous, deluded spaciousness and ease of the North American west
coast.    Matthew Stadler)

SENIORS by GEORGE STANLEY. 16 pp ISBN 0-9735337-8-1 @ $8.00.  (There's a
hidden and perhaps secret fierceness of spirit in the quiet sardonic wit of
these poems, their dismay at the comic helplessness of aging and its
conditioned delights, the narrowing horizons of the ordinary, and muted
wonder at its flavour. "Words have to come out of the world" puns one of
Stanley's flat down-to-earth illusory rejections of the illusory. There's a
toughness in the complexity of such ironic comedies, and delicacy in their
recurrent thought on words, on poems, on where they come from. There's not
one casual utterance in the everydayness of Seniors, but there are currents
of strong feeling. One reads, and rereads, and then one reads again.  Peter
Quartermain)  Vancouver writer George Stanley is the winner of the 2006
Shelley award from the Poetry Society of America.

ADULT VIDEO by MARGARET CHRISTAKOS 26 pp ISBN 0-9735337-7-3 @ $8.00.  (In
the densening recombinations of Margaret Christakos's Adult Video, the poet
plays loop-de-loop with a teeming cast of characters, or demi-characters,
women with names and families whose outline remains enigmatically opaque.
Gertie, Tammy, Meg, Samantha, Elizabeth.  It's a world where letters and
initials stand in for conjunctions and pronouns; where, as Britney Spears
sang, while still a virgin, I'm a slave 4 U.  Margaret Christakos, a poet of
labour, is in addition a brilliant thinker on sexuality and its uses.  Adult
Video takes on the antiseptics and anapestics of a male-driven Oulipean
procedural vision, and pulls them inside out until, finally, something ratty
and valuable lets itself show and moan. Kevin Killian)

COLD TRIP by NANCY SHAW & CATRIONA STRANG 28 pp ISBN 0-9735337-6-5 @ $10.00
(This season offers its coldest pronoun. In the year 2005, the human subject
is sold for oil, bound with fear and gagged with dumb longing.

     Shaw and Strang loosen the pronominal wire.  In COLD TRIP, the tragic
lyric is resung and unsung.  Repetition shifts the I's bind and the subject
finds relief in the civic wide surface of words - "each current/ will win
me/ each surface also." Each tilting word edge is the subject's end and its
agency-the music of identity and its unraveling.  So, sing I thus, and in
the warmth of the possible and in the sorrow of the uncertainty, "the
glowing might be named."  Christine Stewart)

READY FOR FREDDY by RENEE RODIN 32 pp ISBN 0-9735337-5-7 @ $10.00 ("Despite
having been diagnosed with cancer several months before, my father remained
healthy. Sandy and I, Abe's only children, had been told he probably
wouldn't last another year but he had not wanted to hear the prognosis. He
just kept telling everyone 'I'm going to beat it.' . . ." Candid and often
funny, this is a story about siblings and their elderly parent.  It is
riveting and rich -- a new take on a classic theme.)

REWRITING MY GRANDFATHER by GEORGE BOWERING 36 pp ISBN 0-9735337-4-9 $10.00
(One night in his youth, after a great many beers, George Bowering wrote a
poem about his grandfather which has since appeared in countless
anthologies.  It is not Bowering's favorite poem, by a long shot.  Rewriting
My Grandfather tells us why this young-man's grandfather poem cannot go on
unchallenged, and then puts Grandfather goes through some inventive milling
machines.)

WEEPING WILLOW by SHARON THESEN 27 pp ISBN 0-9735337-3-0   $8.00 (Twelve
exquisite poems - wry, gossipy, yet deeply felt - recall Thesen's long-time
friend Angela Bowering.)

ROUSSEAU'S BOAT by LISA ROBERTSON 40 pp  ISBN 0-9735337-1-4  $10.00
(Rousseau's intuition of the abiding jouissance of pre-reflexive existence -
to which non-strategic states of consciousness such as passivity, repose,
and reverie offer the only access - is the matrix from which Lisa Robertson's
new project emerges. Rousseau's "fifth walk" supplies her not so much with a
tutor text to sample and rearrange, as with a generative "figure" in the
Barthesian sense, which is to say a gesture and a posture that render
certain utterances sayable. . . . Rousseau's boat, a vehicle for transport,
not to and from defined docks, but out of directionality and purposiveness
itself, might as well be Cage's anechoic chamber, a space in which stillness
yields not silence but a previously unlistened for sonic plenitude.
Rousseau's boat is a figure for the practice of what Pauline Oliveros calls
"deep listening," a disciplined attention to inescapable, and intricately
differentiated, sonic plenitude.  Steve Evans)  WINNER BP NICHOL CHAPBOOK
AWARD 2004

GOOD EGG BAD SEED  by SUSAN HOLBROOK ISBN 0-9735337-0-6  $10.00

(Starting with the premise "There are two kinds of people," Susan Holbrook
drives supermarket existentialism through its own vortex and gives it a
nifty orgasmic twist into hyperspace.  Here's a ping pong game you'll never
forget  - where the tables keep flipping and players' ironic bats spin the
banal into deadly mischievous curves.)

WORLD ON FIRE by CHARLES BERNSTEIN.  24pp  ISBN 0-9731521-9-2 $10.00 (In a
world where billboards fill the sky and household names rain down with
torrential indifference, Charles Bernstein shows us how to meet the inferno
with exhilarating wit and verve, humorous plays on familiar phrasing, and
nifty substitutions, as we fly our spaceships along the language tracks
available to us.  Meredith Quartermain)

HI DDEVIOLETH I DDE VIOLET by KATHLEEN FRASER. 36pp ISBN 0-9731521-7-6

been more assured and brilliant.  Marjorie Perloff)

THE IRREPARABLE  by ROBIN BLASER.  32pp ISBN 0-9731521-1-7. $10.00. (Who
else but a poet, and not just any poet but Canada's Robin Blaser, could take
on that word "transcendence" and recuperate it in the moment of a civic
frame, one with the capacity to restore us to the "world" restless in world,
the "where is" which is where we abide.  Erín Moure)

SEVEN GLASS BOWLS by DAPHNE MARLATT. 24pp ISBN 0-9731521-5-X. $10.00.
("Home and the closeness of the beloved," she writes. There can be no
subject as important to the poet and the rest of us, and in this lovely
poem, Daphne Marlatt continuously achieves her best yet "homing in." That
present participle is our sweet clue to a mystery we are encouraged to
enter. Gladly.  George Bowering)

WANDERS.   Nineteen poems by ROBIN BLASER with nineteen responses by
Meredith Quartermain. 40pp  ISBN 0-9731521-0-9.  $10.00.  (A spring-coiled
peck from Dickinson on the pitch-perfect cheek of Marianne Moore. Daniel
Comiskey  ++ An amazing, even jaw dropping performance . . . . her poems
absolutely stand up to the challenge of Blaser's own . . . . The sum of it
is totally exhilarating. Ron Silliman)

A THOUSAND MORNINGS  by MEREDITH QUARTERMAIN. 90pp ISBN 0-9731521-2-5.
$10.00.  (A serious-playful and engaging work in which she weighs and sounds
what presents itself outside a real window, inside language, and through
verbal-emotional associations. This work creates an osmotic border between
seeing and writing, a realist hypnogogic passage between memory and today,
between outside and inside, between now and then.  That anywhere is
everywhere is proven once again with this brave, enchanting book.  Rachel
Blau DuPlessis)

OK, Jason, I'll pick em up if you'll pick up Martin Davis's book 'Engines of
Logic' ( http://tinyurl.com/fe9fx ). This looks at the achievements,
failures, and lives of Leibniz, Boole, Frege, Cantor, Hilbert, Godel, and
Turing. It looks at the development of the computer as a story that wends
through the lives of these logicians/mathematicians from 'Leibniz's dream'
of a language of symbolic logic and a machine capable of producing and
testing the truth of propositions expressed in that language. So it is
fascinating as a book in the 'history of ideas' but also concerning the
trials and tribulations in the lives of these seven. And Martin Davis is
himself quite a renowned logician.

Opposing something may not be the most effective strategy in the effort
to create something more evolved to take its place. The U.S. government
and military  is said to oppose terrorism, yet there is a great deal
more terror now in the world than there was on September 11th. (/War on
Terra/.) This is one reason I find Pierre Joris' blog quite remarkable.
Rather than shut down in protest, he uses his blog as a source of
alternative perspectives on the conflict, from Europe and the Middle
East, and has posted a remarkable picture of Israeli girls signing their
names on artillery shells to be used on Lebanon. Quite poignant.

yes, ann. your story in Big Bridge has been interrupted.

the protest works by redirecting ANY and ALL traffic--links from everwhere
to every poet's work in every issue of Big Bridge--to the very austere
protest page.

there is nothing "silent" about this.

and though ostensibly "shut down", all these re-directed links "open" to a
stark message.

it is audacious really, like a protest ought to be.

the people who might complain about it would be the writers and artists
whose work is being blocked by a message they don't agree with. if there are
any of these maybe they'll speak up, rather than  people worried if the
editors of Big Bridge are just taking a vacation.

I am surprised by some answers here. Let me explain first that technically a
site is not a blog. When a site, as in this case Big Bridge shuts down, it
does not mean that the editor(s) are on holiday, but that access is
forbidden to those readers who are interested in getting through some pages
(as I wanted - I haven't got yet to the incredible part dedicated to Karl
Young I was planning for this summer). These readers are faced with a black
page and a protest. I felt this wall when I first saw it, and see it again
every time I get to it. A wall pulled up there for everybody: occasional and
regular readers or contributors, that we should remember, or mildly put,
that we are not the only ones to be shocked.

I find that Michael Rothenberg's position is very strong, and I support it
(as I usually support his choices), even if, as I said, it is against my
immediate interest /or plans.

Good work for the good people behind sites, and especially to M. Rothenberg
and Vernon Frazer!

Since August Highland began exhibiting 24 months ago, he has been in as many
exhibitions, including five solo shows. His solo shows have been applauded
with highly complimentary reviews and press in the LA Weekly, ArtScene,
ArtWeek and the San Diego Union Tribune. His reinventive method of painting
has been a subject of enthusiastic interest by academia as well - he has
lectured at Harvard and other American Universities, has had scholarly
papers about his work presented at literary/art conferences and has been
interviewed over one dozen times.

Coming this Fall, LOOK GALLERY, in association with LOST-AND-FOUND
PRODUCTIONS and END-GAME ENTERTAINMENT, is proud to present "BEYOND WORDS",
an exhibition of new work by August Highland.
"BEYOND WORDS" is sponsored in part by the CULTURE ANIMAL MEDIA GROUP.
Additional funding has been provided through generous contributions by the
Teddy Warburg Memorial Trust, the WLMN Council for the Arts and the J.
Foundation.

Anny, Michael: Forget the vacation thing, silly on my part. But look,
I get a rather melodramatic email announcing a virtually invisible
(virtual) protest. We all protest in our own ways, I suppose, but
this is like a hunger strike in a kindergarten. Its only purpose
seems to be to declare oneself among the righteous. That, and to vent
the frustration that a lot of us feel.

It's difficult, given the power of the presidency, to know what to do
before election day, many deaths from now. In poll after poll the
population at large makes clear its opposition to the war in Iraq to
no effect, and it's hard to imagine any US congress voting to halt
arms shipments to Israel. And short of putting in place a congress
that would be willing to make our loan guarantees to Israel
conditional on good behavior I don't see that we can do much about
Israeli policy.

For a change the images on the evening news (not just on PBS) make it
hard to see what's going on as just a war against those evil
terrorists--the killing or displacement of masses of people who dress
too much like Americans to dismiss as Other might have some impact on
public opinion. And as we get closer to election day that might have
some impact on policy.

Mark,
	While I agree that there is little that we can actually achieve, I
still think it is worth making your statement some how. Individually or in
groups. I may not be out shutting down bridges, yet I still need to speak
out. If only to a few. In any way that we each can. Making art, poetr4y
readings, graffiti,

John Lennon's give peace a chance, while it did not change how congress
voted, while his bed-in for peace did not change how the president acted,
still empowered others to speak out as well.

Speaking out may only be about personal transformation. Change the world,
one person at a time.

'Vowels to blame' for German grumpiness

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/895503.stm

Michael Schumacher: Down in the mouth?

An American professor has developed a theory that Germans are bad-
tempered because pronouncing German sounds puts a frown on the face.

Professor David Myers believes that the facial contortions needed to
pronounce vowels modified by the umlaut may be getting the Germans
down in the mouth.

Chancellor Schroeder: Hard to smile with an umlaut in your name

The umlaut is the two dots which modify the sound of the vowels a, o
and u - dots which many foreigners omit altogether, but which give
the German language three alternative vowel sounds.

Saying "u" - one of German's most recognisable sounds - causes the
mouth to turn down.

But the English sounds of "e" and "ah" - expressions used in smiling
and laughing - have the opposite effect.

Professor Myers told the Royal Society of Edinburgh on Thursday that
frequent use of the muscles which the brain associates with sadness
can adversely affect a person's mood.

"Research has shown that the facial expression of a person can affect
how funny they find cartoons," The London Times quotes him as saying.
"Even when speaking, movements of the muscles in the face can change
a person's mood.

Ex-Chancellor Kohl: Glum over political woes or vowel sounds?

"This could be a good reason why German people have got a reputation
for being humourless and grumpy," said Professor Myers, who heads
Psychology at Hope College, Michigan.

He has just finished a sabbatical at St Andrews University which
involved using electrodes to manipulate the muscles of the face -
research which, he said, bore out his theory.

A spokesperson for the German Embassy said: "We can give no comment
on this as it is too scientific."

     Yesterday as i do a couple times a week i went by a store run by North
African friends and a Palestinian partner. A friend of all of ours of some
years had returned to his family about two months ago in Gaza . . .
     Very late last night i returned to find these messages for the most
part ridiculing an act of protest.
        Since 9/11 often people who agree with the aim of a protest will
still ridicule it or critique it and find it wanting in some way.  It is as
though there is something embarrasing in protest, something from a different
time period, best preserved ,analyzed, eulogized, canonized in images and
words, too messy and time consuming for the present to be cool.  Or just
plain too ridiculous--American presidents & governments since Reagan, along
with tv comics and commentators, have worked tirelessly to create an
atmosphere in which protest is portrayed as  an empty gesture made by self
serving fools, their self righeousness and righteousness the easy butts of
smug superior jokes.  Ridicule is an old technique used in the crushing of
political foes.  One of the attractions of talk  radio and the FOX network
is hearing forms of protest or alternative anythings  ridiculed into
oblivion--all to the benefit of the status quo, if not the increased power
of its most powerful members, which is really the main objective/result. For
a long time after 9/11 protest in the "you're either with us or against us"
atmosphere was easily criticized as un-american or lacking in grief for the
victims of 9/11 etc.  When that began to wear off, ridicule began to take
its place.
      In the "poetics" community a formalist critique of protest takes
place.  Interestingly, people are more suspicious and cynical abt the
motives for a thirty day protest than they are of the daily "news reports"
of events in the Middle East.  The criticism of the protest in many cases
appears to have to do with form--the thirty days--form becomes the primary
issue, not war or opposition to war, a specific war, etc.  When the Sam
Hamill edited POETS AGAINST THE WAR anthology became a surprise
hit--"radical" poets Bernstein, Silliman, Watten critiqued it.  For
Bernstein it was all a  matter of form--the anthology used "normative"
language to respond to the upcoming war in Iraq rather than a discourse of
"ambiguity" "complexity" "skepticism" in exploring the ways these norms are
used to contain dissent.  Before you take a 44 magnum marker to some
cardboard and make a protest poster or grafitti poem or visual sign--stop!
And analyse al the ways what you will write down are basically "normative" (
ie "square")--and containing you in repressive old school discourse--and
write some essays--give some talks at conferences-- on strategies for the
creation of complex ambiguous skepticisms  of normative language in making
protest posters.  Meanwhile . . . as the Arab proverb has it, "The dog
barks, the caravan passes."
     Perhaps if you agree with the views expressed by BIG BRIDGE yet have
problems with the form in which their protest is expressed, organize a
different form of protest which shows your solidariy with theirs.
     . . . no news now for three weeks of our friend and his family.  Gaza
has dropped out of sight in mainstream news--meanwhile, the world's largest
prison has been reinvaded by Israeli tanks, bulldozers, bombs and drones--a
drone killed four people yesterday. 100 Palestinains at least have died in
last three weeks.  Almost no food, no electricity at all, almost no
medecine, now way out, nothing--and now the bombing of the water supplies
has begun.  Internationally recognized as a war crime.
      This is the third friend I have known in Milwaukee who returned to
Palestine to their homeland and families and from reports is either known
dead or presumed dead.  All killed by American weapons which the Israelis
get basically for free under a special program.  (They used to sell  the
excess in these  arms--making 100% proft--to South Africa under the old
white regime.)
In the news today--the USA is expediting a big shipment of bombs and
explosives to Israel, a sign that the bombing wil continue for some weeks.
     Hopefully you can understand how strange to find these poetics messages
at nearly 2 am, filled with familiar severe tension of combined numbness and
rage and grief. Someone was shooting off a pistol--a couple shots near the
crack houses down the street. Pop! pop!  From the window you can see a few
figures flee for the shadows . . .
      Billions of tax payer dollars drained from their own country and sent
to Iraq and Israel--creating more violence at home and more abroad.  "Death
and taxes."  Death is our business.  Is that why protest is
ridiculed--because death and taxes are inevitable?
      Again, if it is the form of the protest which bothers you, and not the
substance, show support for the substance by choosing what you think a
better way and use that to show solidarity.
       "United we stand, divided we fall"--

        Meanwhile, the deaths of Palestinians go unnoticed and unnamed--and
for the most part also the ones in neighborhoods like ours across the Land
of the Free and Home of the Brave.
         As it says in George Orwell's ANIMAL FARM--"all animals are created
equal, but some are more equal than others".

          Thank you to Big Bridge for a non-silent protest of the powerful
black screen and white letters at their site. The colors in their starkness
and letters' weights as forms,  speak more powerfully to me than than the
words alone.
           Whe I look at it i think of a poem i wrote for another
Palestinian friend who is known to have been killed on return to homeland.
It ends "to take in darkness/until all that remains/is light".
             I hope many many many create many many many forms of protest
rather than critiquing and ridiculing the forms of others with whom one
purports to agree.

             Here, for example, M. Antonin Artaud:  "And if there is still
one hellish, truly accursed thing in our time, it is our artistic dallying
with forms, instead of being like victims at the stake, signaling through
the flames."

            Signalling--yes,--victims--no---

OK, I might as well offend more people. For me the primary quality of
that banner-headline protest was self-vaunting. Accounts like yours,
based in compassion and loss, are more to the point. The question is
how to keep them flowing beyond our very limited community. Not easy
in a country where almost no one reads even a newspaper.

Me, I give at the office. Appalled by the attitudes I found towards
Mexico in San Diego, I edited an anthology of poetry from immediately
beyond the border. Not an overtly political act, but hopefully those
who read it had a harder time seeing the next neighborhood over as
merely a source of cheap booze, cheap blowjobs and cheap labor. It
sold well in places devoted to Baja California tourism on the US
side, and in the local art museums, both beyond the choir of the
already convinced. Now I'm doing a Cuban anthology, which won't
satisfy anybody politically who looks for overt content, but which
hopefully will broaden people's understanding.  The point is to stop
reducing others to caricatures.

Maybe I should have plastered the cover of the Baja California book
with a slogan like "read this, it will make you a better person, like
me." I don't think that would have helped the book accomplish even
the little bit that it did.

Somebody mentioned John Lennon's Give Peace a Chance. It happens that
I was one of 300,000 protestors at the Washington Monument when
Lennon first sang it. A jingle to help rally our troops. Those
rallies happened weekly. It would be nice if something similar
happened now, but I doubt it will unless the draft is brought back,
this time without exemptions for the relatively well-off.

Interesting that Mark Weiss' objection to the Big Bridge protest
actually demonstrates the effectiveness of the gesture, in provoking
discussion to begin with, and as an expression of the frustration
Mark Weiss professes to feel. Big Bridge has, of course, not shut
down; the statement that appears on its website is, in itself, a work
of socially engaged art. The absence of the usual poems and articles
is part of the work.

I may not be entirely happy with the general anti-war statement in
itself, but I recognize the effectiveness of the gesture.

Waiting for elections has never been and will never be a useful
strategy, especially in a closed undemocratic system like the US.
Only mass protest that gradually breaks down the social order, that
disrupts business as usual can affect any change. The electoral
results will follow in the wake of real political action. And mass
protest begins with courageous individual gestures by people willing
to suspend business as usual, which includes the smooth progress of
their individual careers and lives. Short of violent "terrorist"
action, any forms that cause discomfort, disruption and provoke
thinking and resistance among US citizens (and Canadians now that
we're engaged in Afghanistan) is welcome as far as I'm concerned.

Bah, seems silly and childish, its not making a difference.  Besides,
people have work published there, thats a lot bullshit. Inconvienience
doesn't upset the ones your mad at, it offends those who contribute to you

The ways and means in which the NY Times tilts its editorial hat on any
issue (I find) often a mystery. Big Bridge threw its own rock in it's own
stream - literally a dam/a blockade - that's obviously provoked folks one
way or the other. I don't think Michael is being self-indulgent at all. His
shut-down, it seems to me, comes from an acknowledgment of horror - such as
the consequences of this war and our implication as US Citizens in the
support of maximizing the devastation of Lebanon.

There are obviously also other approaches. Yesterday I was cynically
speculating that some editor/publisher has no doubt begun to put together a=
n
anthology of Lebanese-Israeli poems, ones that focus on the interplay of th=
e
cultures of these two countries. Such an editorial gesture (no matter how
well intended) in light of the reality of the Israeli invasion seems, on th=
e
face of it, so futile, a 'we are but flies to the Gods', i.e. Bush, C. Rice=
,
Rumsfeld and, whatever I don't know about the leadership of Hezbollah, etc.
In terms of these decisions, artists and poets are not permitted to the
table.

Yet, this morning, I stopped in a Palestinian corner grocery - of which
there are many in San Francisco - to buy a New York Times. Not that I neede=
d
help to see the front page, the owner - a  look of disgust on his face -
pointed to the photograph of about a dozen wooden coffins leaning against a
town wall, each of them a civilian casualty of Israeli bombs. Next to the
photograph was the article about this country's rush shipment to Israel of
105,000 pounds of 'precision bombs. This article conjoined somewhat
obscenely with the photograph yesterday of young Israeli girls apparently
drawing messages on bombs to be aimed at the Lebanese.

Whoever the NY Times picture editor - and front page designer - the
combination photo and story was a concrete, literal assertion of the fact
that the United States is using Israel as a proxy for whatever its interest=
s
are in the Mid-East (vis-=E0-vis Syria and Iran). Otherwise I assume this
kidnapping of the Israeli soldiers could have been easily solved with a
prisoner exchange, etc. - and not a full scale "out of proportion war." But
more to the point, on a personal level, there it was, point blank, my and
our tax dollars used to finance the "precise" bombing and killing of those
folks in the coffins on the front page.

I am not too knowledgeable about late 1930's history in this country. But
the experience with the Palestinian grocer this morning made me imagine and
wonder whether or not there were similar scenes among Jewish shop keepers i=
n
this country, particularly the growing news and awareness of Hitler's
concentration camps and the refusal of Roosevelt's Government to acknowledg=
e
genocide and needs of refugees. Were those Jewish shop keepers - similar to
the Palestinian grocer - looking at the WASP and other clientele and
desperately wondering why they and the Government were remaining so
oblivious to the horror?
Yes, given what is going on, I cannot explain, even within myself, what the
response and protests to this point are still so vacant. Six years of Bush =
-
and even with the polls so much against him - there is a sense of amputatio=
n
on the left (or, at least, the outrage remains buried).  What is going to
crack it open, I am not sure.

Waiting for a Democratic leader with guts still seems the longest shot in
town. And we know who owns and controls the major media.

I agree with miekal in addition, I've used perl scripts implementing
markov chains to "scramble" something I've already written. Although
strictly speaking it's not cut-up text, I found it interesting:

I also agree. To me as a computer dude I wanted to play with it and maybe
use the computer to remove the drudge part. But, in art, it's the jaggy
edges the rough parts that make the art what it is. Machine generated does
not make it to me.

What a bunch of crap this whole discussion is. We're sitting around discussing the "Poetics" and "Value of the artistic statement" about some dumb
website that I'd never read before this point deciding that replacing itself with a big black page with a statement of it's politics in some way had
anything at all to do with anything. This sort of self-congradulating nonsense is not just ineffective, it is the SOURCE of what you are protesting.
Protests like this, in effect, say "I as an individual am making myself feel better about injustice in the world." and I'm sorry, but that sort of act
is cowardly bullshit pandering to an idea of political conviction qua fashionability that, frankly, fucking disgusts me. If you're really that upset
about what's going on, which I doubt, go blow something up. Organize a group of people to block a freeway during rush hour. Go hand out information
leaflets on your lunch hour to people on the streets, do something that has some impact beyond your own quiet little upper middle class white college
educated coterie faux radicals whose self-inflicted impotence has doomed them to continually spewing a bunch of crap like "Poets against the war," to
cite a perfect example of preaching to the choir someone else has already brought up, which only serves to give the talk radio and FoxNEWS talking
heads more examples of ineffective dumb liberal nonsense to point at and ridicule. What does the right do when they're pissed off about something?
They firebomb abortion clinics, they write legislation that they know will fail and try to push it through anyway, they write "contracts with america"
and take control of the political debate by getting their wealthy allies to fund think tanks to support a cadre of well-spoken, highly educated pundit
shock troops capable of making coherent, lucid policy statements anywhere in the country at a moments. What does the left do? We cry, we talk about
the great protests of the past, and we write poetry about how fucking sad we are, then make obtuse mandarin gestures like the shutting down of Big
Bridge.

Don't get me wrong, I'm no less guilty of this than anyone else. I haven't done anything remotely political since I marched in protest before the
beginning of the Iraq war. It was the inneffectiveness, the lameness, the stupidness of that action that doomed it to failure. Why is that
progressives can get together and do something futile and dumb, but can't get together to do something useful, like organize laborers in third world
countries making our nikes, or push into office reasonable political candidates with strong beliefs about progressive issues, rather than middle of
the road neo-liberals and even conservatives like Hilary Clinton, Joe Lieberman, and, judging by his voting record so far, Barak Obama, the great
progressive hope? I don't know why that is. I do know that I'm broke. That I have bills to pay. That I have goals in my life that have nothing to do
with Palestine or transjordan. Does my humanity make me feel like a shitheel for the fact that my tax dollars have been translated into blowing up
lebanese children? You're damn right it does. But I'm not going to do those kids the disrespect of pretending like making a bunch of empty
pseudo-artsy gestures does anything whatsoever to alleviate their suffering. I'm not going to show anybody the poetry I've been writing about Beirut
and Hizbollah because it doesn't do those kids a damn bit of good. And to be completely honest, I wish i had the courage of a Cesar Chavez, a Che
Guevarra, a Martin Luther King Jr, or a Thich Quang Duc, or a Rachel Corrie God rest her brave soul. But I don't. I'm a coward. I'll march if someone
says "March today, show up" I'll vote for progressive candidates, I'll give money to amnesty international and the ACLU when they ask me for it. I
subscribe to mother jones and do my best to read international newspapers. But i'm not enough of a fool to not recognize the cowardice in this, the
fact that these are things I do because I'm afraid to go back to college, get a nursing degree, then go work for Doctors without Borders or the
international Red Cross/Red Crescent. I don't spend my free hours learning to speak Farsi or Arabic so that I can go to the middle east with
humanitarian aid organization and actually DO something worthwhile. These are options that every single person on this list defending this bullshit
shut down protest as something noble and valiant has open to them, and I don't see any of you doing them, and that makes you all cowards just like me.
So at least have the decency to shut the fuck up and feel bad about it, rather than pretending all this pretty talk makes the least bit of difference
to poor children suffering the world over so that we can wear cheap clothes that weren't made by anyone we know, eat organically grown produce in cute
little overpriced bistros, and drink gallons of over priced bad coffee at the corner espresso stand. At least do the people making the real sacrifices
and doing the real hard work so that we can sit around and bicker about philosophy and advertise our blogs and poetry readings the honor and justice
to recognize that you aren't one of them, you're never going to be, and that your petty little attempts to feel better about it aren't really worth
bragging about in public. At least recognize that we're all the same shitheel in the same sinking ship and don't try to grab hold of the moral life
preserver that the people who are really making a difference have built for themselves from their own sweat and sacrifice. It's fucking tacky.

Catherine,
Who told you that light text on a dark background is easier to read?  =
I'd like to read that report.=20

That contradicts dozens of tests I had conducted while I was employed.  =
The findings then were:
Black ink on a white (but not stark white) background was far more =
easily read.

Further, those studies found sans serif type far superior to serif text =
as far as readability was concerned.

For my former employer, I spent considerable money on that research, =
millions actually.  I doubt they'll share the findings with us, but I =
can assure you, the studies were truly independent, non-biased, and in =
scientific terms nearly pure. =20

I have in my records, some of the original notes from some of the =
studies.  Two other points that might be worth noting here:

*    people reading light text on a dark background monitor experience =
eye fatigue more quickly
*    readers are more easily confused reading script or Italic fonts =20

If you are interested in putting your employees (or your students) to =
sleep quickly, bring up a dark green screen and use a crisp yellow tone =
to highlight your Edwardian script text....
Alex=20
P.S. Even the colored inks (thank you USA Today) tend to be far more =
tiring than the black on white in the daily news. =20

Oh, and formatting on the screen of a monitor has no bearing on the =
data...that's just a programmer's job.  Believe me, if one were more =
labor costly than the other, you'd be using the cheaper...it's called =
profit margin. =20

personally, i find a black background and off-white text easier to read.
looking at a white screen can be physically painful to me: too bright,
highly radiated. that's why i use a black background on my site, usually.
also, when you do use color amid a black background (in graphics, not text),
the combo of color and black background can somehow give the impression of
the color being lit from within, sort of stained-glass-like. whereas a white
background dominates the color of the graphics and detracts from the energy
of the graphics.

not scientific but i've been looking at monitors way too much for years.

yes, Jim, but you are one of a study of one...have you color =
deficiencies? are you prejudiced in some unknown way to specific colors? =
have you a pre-conceived view of the "moral" value of "black" versus =
"white"?  etc. etc.=20

Also, your personal views of the use of color are interesting, but not =
necessarily representative of the mass audience. =20

Among a focus group of say, 6 rooms of 20 viewers per room, would your =
views represent the majority or the minority?  More specifically, you =
are 1 of a 100,000,000 readers.  Granted, you are an important personae, =
but the fraction still stands, undisputed. =20

Your response suggests to this researcher that you fall into that group =
of folks who believe their personal opinion represents the majority =
simply because it's the view they hold.  Unfortunately, research =
supports exactly the opposite: those who hold that their opinion is =
'the' opinion tend to fall into the fewer than .02% of the minority, =
rather than the .51% of any majority. =20

But, Jim, don't be dismayed by that point.  I'm there with you.  And the =
hardest thing I had to learn in my former job was: nobody cared what my =
thoughts were.  They only cared what the majority's view held.=20

on the sort of site i do i have to go with what feels right to me. it's all
about subjective experience. but readability is a big concern for me. so is
design. and emotional tone. and accessibility. and interactive interest. and
whether it works at different resolutions and on different browsers and
different operating systems. Also, a white monitor during daylight is easier
to look at than a white monitor at night.

if you look at interesting art sites on the web, you won't find a lot of
white backgrounds. this is not simply to be arty but to achieve a look and
experience that is more pleasurable than what you normally get with a white
background.

haven't you experienced eye pain at looking at a monitor's white background
at night? this is not the case with a black background. but if the contrast
between the black background and the text is not high enough, yes, that can
be hard to read, during the daytime.

also, note that i said "personally". so i'm not sure what gives you the
impression that i feel my views represent the majority. but there are far
too many variables involving the type of information presented to conclude
that a white background is always more readable. the range of types of
information displayable on a monitor ranges from simple email to animated
interactive work to video to development environments such as Director, etc.
there are too many variations for even a million dollars to decide the
issue.

i mostly delete my poetics digests of late, as i'm barely able to keep up
with my life, forget about the poetics list. but i happened to look at the most
recent digest tonight/this morning, and i can't be silent about what i see. i
 don't know if i'm the only person who is willing to state something other
than  bad israel--maybe i am, i don't know--i don't have time to look over all
the  recent digests. but really--don't you think it's more complex than this?

some thoughts:


i am against war, i am against wanton killing.

i do not support the destruction of lebanon.

i do not support the destruction of israel.

i do support a jewish homeland, in a historically jewish land.


i do support israel's stated aim of a lebanese-controlled border.

lebanon is supposed to be controlling its own border, according to a u.n.
resolution from 2004.

hezbollah, the current border patrol, funded largely by syria and  iran,
publicly states their desire for israel's destruction.




most american people don't know the history of israel. many don't know the
history of the jewish people. and i mean HISTORY, not (just) the holocaust,
which counts for history in the minds of many. think thousands of years--the
jewish calendar is in year 5766.

the united states is 230 years old. thousands of years younger than the
jewish people, israel, the whole "middle-east" region.

it is convenient to think of israel as an arm of the u.s.  government.

it is less convenient to think of an entire region wanting to destroy a  land
and a people.

maybe the recent comments from iran's government, the ones about the
destruction of israel, are easy to ignore if you think of israel as equivalent  to
american imperialism, instead of a historical homeland for people who  have been
persecuted for thousands of years.

maybe it's easy to think imperialism bad, civilians good, so bad israel,
good lebanon. unfortunately, wretchedly, the citizens of lebanon have  hezbollah
implanted into their civilian areas. bad israel, good hezbollah?



people have been trying to eradicate the jewish people for thousands of
years.

it is not a simple history, it is not a simple place, it is not a simple
region, there are no simple answers.

i'm hopeful that this email will cause some thoughts, but i can't help but
think that most people don't really want to question. people seem to want
simple  answers in tidy packages. hate this, love that, check this box, leave this
one  blank.

i refuse to believe in such simplicity. i just can't. i won't.


this whole mess is devastating.

i hope for an end to the destruction, the loss of lives, the tearing apart
of countries.

Jill,
I think it's a huge mistake to conflate modern Israel with either biblical Israel or the jewish ethnicity. modern Israel did not exist before 1948 and
the fact of the matter is that Israel has as much right to exist as does the current non-existent palestinian state, and if we're talking about
strictly historical grounds rather than who was given what tract of land by God at what point in the dim past, possibly the palestinian state,
consisting of the descendents of the residents of palestine under turkish and british rule, has even more right. And yet modern Israel continues to
function as if this were not the case. To challenge the behavior of Israel, which at this point in history has become an oppressive right wing state
as bad as South Africa was under apartheid, if not worse, is not to challenge the rights of jews to live there, particularly those who were born
there. Unfortunately, the modern state of Israel has chosen to side with the religious fanatics who insist on living in the settlements beyond
israel's historical borders, they have chosen to continue to hold the west bank and gaza, and they have continued to push the palestinian refugees,
many of whom were forcibly evicted from their rightful property historically speaking, into other arab nations, which arab nations, not immune to
either anti-semitism, nor teh brutality of dictatorial control, don't want them. Given that on both sides, the factions use religious terminology in
their propaganda, it's not unlikely that various groups are going to be calling for other various groups destruction.

The fact of the matter is that under Syrian rule, Israel has had less trouble with Hezbollah than prior to Syrian occupation. At the same time, Israel
continues to occupy Shabaa Farms and the Golan Heights. the fact that when Israel takes land, they rarely give it back, and the fact that the israeli
government continues to play the "Arabs just hate jews" card that you are trying to play here, is the reason why Hezbollah (not Lebanon or the
lebanese in general, who are the victims of Israel's current actions) continues to want Israel wiped from the map. Put yourself in the place of a goat
herder displaced by Israeli tanks and prohibited from returning to land that has belonged to your people since before the destruction of the second
temple. wouldn't you want that goverment gone? but no, they want the destruction of the jews you say. So therefore Israel is justified in carpet
bombing southern Lebanon? you say "unfortunately, wretchedly, the citizens of Lebanon have hezbollah implanted into their civilian areas. bad Israel,
good hezbollah?" and miss the point that Hezbollah is a guerilla movement because Israel outmatches them. why do they outmatch them? because of your
tax dollars. whose fault then is it that the Israelis are blowing up hundreds of innocents from the air because hezbollah wanted three of their people
released from prison and killed a few israeli soldiers and kidnapped a couple more?

That's right, it's your fault. and mine. you're damn right, bad Israel good hezbollah. Were i living in southern Lebanon, i'd hope i would be fighting
the israeli occupation too, but i doubt it because i continue to be dismayed at my own perpetual impotence in the face of injustice in the world. Even
more than bad Israel, bad us for creating Israel. Bad us for supporting the state of Israel unconditionally and letting things get this bad. bad us
for not fighting hard enough to keep the neo-cons out of power. bad us for ceding control of our government to corporate forces who need a foothold of
sympathetic western thinkers in the middle east. bad us for missing the opportunity presented by the collapse of the soviet union to work to
restructure the territorial disputes that we and they had encouraged during the cold war. Bad us for equating our national interest with economic
rather than humanitarian concerns. Bad us for thinking ethnic cleansing is bad proportionate to how much those being cleansed are like us. And bad us
for letting people like you continue to justify one oppressive act on the part of Israel by citing the historical oppression of the jewish people. I
for one am not going to allow such statements go unchallenged anymore. that's something my cowardice doesn't keep me from doing.

I know that jews have been persecuted, and i know there is a claim that states that the jewish diaspora has a right to the land given to them by God
after moses left Egypt. I fail to see how either of those facts make the mechanized mass slaughter of civilians in southern Lebanon anything other
than an outrage, and i don't see any reason for bringing it up other than to try to generate sympathy for the people doing the slaughtering. you pay
lip service to the idea that it's a complex situation that requires a complex solution, but then criticize us, the cowards on the list for peeping out
of our comfortable hidy holes and daring to say that yes, Israel is wrong for doing what it is doing. No one on this list has said anything about
supporting the destruction of Israel or the killing of Israelis, and yet you raise this as a straw man argument in order to make the same "you're
either with Israel or you're an antisemite" position that is precisely the sort of simplistic right wing view of the Mideast problem that you're
claiming to be critical of. Such positions are exactly the sort of thinking that the Israeli state and the right wing ideologues who run it are
banking on in order to get away with this terrible crime they are committing. I know that they will get away with it, i know arguing with you about it
won't change anything, i know that i am a cipher in this and nothing I can say will make a difference. Still, i'm saying it any way because i'm tired
of people not saying it.

Because it's way easier to do something futile and dumb. It takes an
enormous amount of work to organize an effective political campaign.
Phone calls. Mail. Door-to-door walking and talking. Raising money.
Keeping track of money. Spending money wisely. It's instantly
hierarchical -- someone has to be able to deposit and write checks.
That someone's acts and speech are instantly subject to more serious
scrutiny than the opposition's -- because it's right there right now
and it impacts whether there's free coffee or not, and the like.

As a result, even when liberals and progressives actually do get
together with serious intent their predilection for talking rather
than doing gets in the way, and they talk their initiatives to death.
Should we be organizing third world laborers in Indonesia or Guam?
Malay or Burma? Should we call it Burma or Myanmar?

Feh.

Lets be frank, people of the Jewish faith which arose with Abraham have been
victims of great persecution in history, but no worse persecution than other
groups for example victims of the African Slave trade, Armenians, Greeks in
Anatolia, Poles in Poland under the Russians and the Germans, Tibetans,
Africans all over Africa and of course Native Americans and Indig.
Australians.

The difference is that Israel has in its history the fact that Yahweh,
according to the Book of Genesis, gave the land as a covenant to the Jewish
people and Zionism is based on the notion that the land of Israel is the
homeland of the Jews and this comes from God. Many Christians especially
those who support our 'president'believe this as well and hope the world
will end and that Israel is part of prophecy. There is a millenial sense
here that is not rational. When you interject Religion and divine commands
into a situation you have real problems and this is the world we are now
living in.

Hezbollah and Hamas are Reactions to the creation of the State of Israel. I
am not arguing here that Israel does not have the right to exist-it does-
but since 1948 over 4 million Palestians have been expelled from their
homes. The Christian population of Palestine that was over 600,000 in 1948
with towns dating from the time of Christ is now less than 50,000 and over
1200 Palestian towns are no longer on the map with over 6000 mosques some
over 1400 years old destroyed or abandoned. This did not occur because the
Palestinians wanted to leave they were expelled.

In Lebanon a nation that until 1950 had a harmonious existance with 40% of
the Population Christian and 60% Muslim with real prosperity and a middle
class but the Middle East Crisis has resulted in a destroyed Lebanon- with
millions who have either died or immigrated or live as refugees.

Now in Iraq the same forces- violence and Extremism are filling that nations
void with religion based extremism. In the end not one of the parties really
believes in peace- or Justice. They believe in righting wrongs regardless of
who is hurt.

The Israelis like to bring up the Holocaust which was a horror in fact
members of my family died in he Holocaust but this was a horror not
perpetrated by Arabs, in fact it was done by Europeans and with aquiescence
of Americans. Why are Arabs asked to pay for this sin?

In the end there is a cycle of violence here that allows extremists to
thrive when what we need is diplomacy and rationalism. Israel cannot
continue to oppress the Palestinians the way they do and not expect violence
and Arab and Muslim extremist groups cannot continue to do Terrorism without
their being consequences so where does the violence end?

I think it ends with the realization that God is not part of the solution. I
write this as a believer but our global society should be based on universal
human rights and that means that nations cannot be based in divine gifts
(Israel's Covenant) or Holy War (Jihad) but in the value of each human
person to attain justice. I say Fuck peace in Israel and say lets start
talking about Justice which is better than peace.

to which one might well add that Israel is in open volation of any number of UN
resolutions and international law on the subject of building permanent
settlements and laying claim to lands occupied in war --

and one might well make a distinction between the idea of a home for Jews in
lands they had historically populated and a Jewish state -- Under the Law of
Return, any Jew anywhere in the world can go to Israel and become a citizen --
which sounds fairly reasonable until you add that no Arab whose family once
lived in what is now Israel is accorded that same right -- Indeed,
Palestinians' claims to their own right of return have been ruled off the table
by both Israel and the US government --

and Yes -- Not many Americans know the history of Israel -- And I dare say even
fewer know the history of the region and the history of its Arab populations --


And however much one may deplore the actions of Hezbollah (which we shouldn't
need reminding didn't exist until Israel invaded Lebanon in the 80s -- Israel's
plan to "clear out" the PLO from Lebanon then leaves us where we are now -- I
shudder to think what will come from the plan to "clear out" Hezbollah now) the
fact is that Israel, pointing to the existence of a UN Resolution, has
unilaterally invaded a sovreign nation without UN authorisation (sound
familiar?) --

And what is especially galling is that the Israeli government spokepeople keep
getting in front of cameras and declaring that they are doing the Lebanese
people a favor -- I have now heard this repeated at least fifteen times -- this
from the same government that promised just days ago to put Lebanon back fifty
years -- and judging from the orgy of destruction we see on our televisions, it
appears they are succeeding in that aim.

While we debate the best method for addressing the latest Lebanon
crisis, one Lebanese web designer, educated in Canada and the U.S. has
created a blog with amazing material from his home in the Bekaa Valley.
He was featured on CNN and the interview with him is still on their
front page and is the most-watched video on that website.

His site is http://www.lebanonlive.blogspot.com/ and he goes by Beezer.
To watch the CNN interview and then the unedited version on his site is
quite an education in how "news" is conveyed by major American news
agencies. This is why, for 15 years, I produced long-form radio
interview programs WITHOUT major editing. Sort of like a projective
verse in conversation. http://www.globalvoicesradio.org/hour.html

He also has links to an interesting Chomsky interview. In it Chomsky
points out the Israeli abduction of Lebanese civilians that preceded the
Hezbollah abduction of Israeli soldiers. In the comment box there are a
couple of the usual denunciations of Chomsky, but none speak to the
facts he brings up, preferring to use the method of attacking his
character than the facts.

Everyone has their own way of responding to crisis. To me, Beezer's blog
has the most value, as I can get a first-hand account and draw my own
conclusions. He is a brave man and shows it's better to live one day as
a lion than a lifetime as a sheep.

a black background with white text is easier to read, at least it draws more
attention to the text then black type on white.

I've only dipped into this discussion for moments, but it seems to me
that different contributors mean different things by "read."  If
what's meant is a billboard image, not something dwelt-on or read as
a prolonged process, sure, white on black works well. It's why I
sometimes use dropout letters on book covers. Part of what makes it
memorable is precisely its painfulness--on one book cover I
deliberately used lettering in the complementary color to the
background, so that the letters appeared to vibrate. But for a text
black on white is a lot more restful, which may be why printers,
who've had the choice since before Gutenberg, almost always choose it.

I'm sure that's why almost every book is set in a serif type.  Or are you
just referring to on-screen text?  All the wisdom I've seen regarding video
text says that the background should be somewhat less than stark white, and
the text should be dark.  Pure white on a screen is akin to staring at a
light bulb.  I find a pale yellow with a tinge of brown as a background
works well when I'm working for extended periods.  That's my 2p worth.

It's a blog aggregator for peace activists on every side of the various

thank you to those of you who responded to my post--and those who would  have
posted even without my post--with information, where to find more
information, and expressions of your ideas/beliefs/opinions about israel,  lebanon, and
the whole mess.

i felt very uncomfortable stating my opinion, as i knew i would likely be
attacked, misinterpreted, reviled. so many times the climate of the list turns
hostile.

i'm glad to see real information exchange here.


(of course, jason q, this is not addressed to you. i'm still reeling from
your misinterpretation and character assassination. i can't even read your
i-hate-jill post again to see if it has salient points.)

protest via symbols is better than no protest at all

Dear List,

Sorry for this late response.  Too busy with other things..

Some pedantic notes.  We should not trust these word searches from the
Perseus website.  Maybe there is a font problem.  I don't know.  But as
a matter of fact the word 'eris' is very frequent in Hesiod, especially
in his *Works and Days.*  He and Empedocles both were preoccupied with
the role of Strife in the unfolding of things.  Hesiod is especially
interesting because he distinguishes between good strife and bad
strife.  Good strife is more or less equivalent to striving for the
good, whereas bad strife is a striving for dissension, i.e. strife.
Striving and strife are mreely reflections of each other, and of course
they are linguistic cognates.

Hesiod knew well the problem that we ourselves are facing now here in
the US: what to do with these vacuous evil-doers who have seemingly
irrepressible power?  In other words, what we are dealing with -- when
it  comes to Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, et al. -- has been a perpetual
problem  as far as we know our own history.  We have been dealing with
it for many thousands of years. Hesiod dealt with it, like so many
others, before & after him.  Now we are dealing with it again.  No
progress, so far.

I don't have the best resources available at hand -- just a bunch of
books in my personal library, as well as a willingness to read them.  In
any case, as far as I can tell, the source of the Duncan passage in
Passages 22 [which I don't have at hand] appears to be Diels - Kranz
124, which is not cited in *The Presocratic Philosophers* of Kirk &
Raven.  Maybe some classicist can confirm this by using Perseus or some
other  machine better than I can.

So there.

As for Sanskrit, the only early Modernist who knew it well, as far as I
can tell, was T.S. Eliot, in the Wasteland.  He learned his Sanskrit at
Harvard under I. Babbitt.  Of course, as far as this list is concerned
Eliot was a dead-end.

As for how I myself got from Duncan to the Vedas, it must have been
through some archaeological interest in archaic poetry, like Duncan's
own archaeological interests, perhaps, or perhaps Olson's.

In any case, I have staked out early Vedic poetics, one of the earliest
poetics from antiquity that still survives for our examination.  I think
that it is of great interest.

Best,

George Thomspson

That's odd, because back in the early sixties
Duncan told me and my friends to read Eliot,
reluctant as we WCW fans were.

Hi George,

L'm sorry, don't know what you're talking bout here. What's Perseus website?
What has Passages 22 got to do with any of this? This here "discussion"
started with a question from someone else about 2 Greek words in Empedoklean
Reveries, a Duncan poem in Groundwork which IS a Passages, but not numbered
and certainly not 22.

Thanks for all that other info. I'm sure it will be helpful to many. I
myself can't go there right now (& am not indeed a big Hesiod fan).

Best,  Diane di Prima

yeah well, i agree with michael r., my friend and publisher (ok so nobody
can access my political piece for a month), we homo saps are all fucked up.
and so what else is new?  i could shut down my own multimedia/lit site
easily, but we only emerge maybe 3 x a year and we already are more than
blatently "political," so why?   i just knew the minute michael made his
stand, there would be the usual response from lefties who hate israel.  and
frankly, as a jew and a leftie and a lapsed crim/constitutional attorney
with more than a well develped knee jerk reaction to the shit, and someone
who publishes a political lit mag (in no uncertain terms), and also as
someone who tried to get editors and publishers to join the KEEP INTERNET
ACCESSIBLE movement, with ZERO success (see
http://www.madhattersreview.com---link to
http://www.savetheinternet.com/, because I merely asked publishers to link
the site to their homepages and that was too much to expect ------------
yeah.  so i just want to say i think that we all thinking people realize how
far we people of this planet are from extinction.  so we should all do
SOMETHING, like pick the political websites we want our readers and our
readers' friends to look at (whom are we kidding?  like a whole big
population of repugs is gonna be checking lit mags??? what? are you
kidding?) and point those wanderers to links.

i could give you a bunch of links.  but that's not the point.  hell, as i
said, i don't think the Internets{sick} are going to remain accessible to
all but the very rich.  so hey, you do what you think is necessary to
preserve us.... like float that banner.  Israel is far from perfect,and as
far as i'm concerned, it's not merely a puppet of fucked up USA and i'm
terribly ashamed of "my" country, and i hate what the middle east
fundamentalist kooks and filthy rich leaders are doing to their own people.
and i don't back what Isreal's doing either.  and it's all fucking
sickening.  so i don't really want to hear the usual kneejerk reactions.
sorry.  can't we do better than that?

"Around us, everything is writing; that's what we must perceive. Everything
is writing. It's the unknown in oneself, one's head, one's body. Writing is
not even a reflection, but a kind of faculty one has, that exists to one
side of oneself, parallel to oneself: another person who appears and comes
forward, invisible, gifted with thought and anger, and who sometimes,
through her own actions, risks losing her life. Into the night." --
Marguerite Duras

Dear All,

July is screeching to a halt [can you believe it?] and we've got
another two fantastic poets who will lull you with their gentile
lyricism only to smack you in the face with a metaphor. You know
you love it, so come to McNally Robinson Bookstore this Wednesday
and get your dose of poetry.

JESSICA FJELD was selected by Lyn Hejinian as the recipient of the
Poetry Society of America's New York Chapbook Fellowship in 2006.
Her poems are forthcoming in the next issue of the Backwards City
Review,and have previously appeared in the Columbia Review. Like
2.6 million other people, she lives in Brooklyn.

TIMOTHY DONNELLY is the author of Twenty-Seven Props for a
Production of Eine Lebenszeit and Poetry Editor of Boston Review.
He lives in Brooklyn.

See you there.
Cheers
N

Hello George,

I just read these lines from *Bending the Bow* the other day ["passages 24", p.78]:

Down this dark corridor, "this passage," the poet reminds me,

	and now that Eliot is dead, Williams and H.D. dead,

	     cunning passages, contrived corridors"

	comes into the chrestomathy.


When I said  "Of course, as far as this list is concerned Eliot was a dead-end," what I meant was that the Poetics List in general belongs to the "Williams" branch of the poetic tree.  The Eliot branch has gone off in another direction.  Maybe I'm wrong about this, but I've been reading this list for years and I don't recall very much interest in Eliot.  By the way, the reason why I am on this list is that I have belonged to the "Williams" branch too.

Also, Diane, I apologize for the confusion.  I don't have the passage at hand, so I'm the one who is confused.  But in any case, the discussion has gotten me to re-read Duncan and Hesiod, and that is good.  I've been thinking a lot about Duncan, and San Francisco, and Berkeley, lately.

Best to you both,

George

Going into the weekend, Israel was warning all citizens of southern Lebanon that
they should leave their homes and evacuate the area.

Yesterday, Israeli forces, in at least six incidents, fired upon people who were
following the warnings and evacuating.  In one episode, an Israeli helicopter
hit a minivan full of innocent evacuees in a missile strike.


On another issue, does anybody besides me find this suspect?  Following the
assasination of a major political leader in Lebanon just months ago, the US and
the world demanded, quite rightly, that Syria remove all its troops from
Lebanon.  So they did (though they are suspected of leaving agents behind).  So
there were no Syrian army forces in Lebanon when Israel decided to respond to
the Hezbollah outrage by invading and bombing.

Coincidence?  Perhaps . . .

This is from a site called The Almanac of Policy Issues -- and it's
just as riveting as the subject heading sounds. The formatting and
footnotes didn't transcribe too well, but what's most striking is how

HHS, with a stroke of the pen, changes "industry standards" and sets

Summary=A0

With certain restrictions, the President has announced that federal
funds may be used to conduct research on human embryonic stem cells.
Federal research is limited to 64 1 existing stem cell lines that
were derived (1) with the informed consent of the donors; (2) from
excess embryos created solely for reproductive purposes; and (3)
without any financial inducements to the donors. No federal funds
will be used for the derivation or use of stem cell lines derived
from newly destroyed embryos; the creation of any human embryos for
research purposes; or cloning of human embryos for any purposes.
Several lawsuits have been filed relating to stem cell research, and
questions have been raised concerning access to existing stem cell
lines by federal researchers.

Human Embryonic Stem Cells. Human embryonic stem cells are "master
cells" and are able to develop into almost any cell in the human
body. Building on earlier stem cell research, in 1998, researchers at

the University of Wisconsin isolated cells from the inner cell mass
of the early human embryo, called the blastocyst, and developed the
first human embryonic stem cell lines. 2 Research has focused on the
potential that these cells can offer to treat or mitigate diseases
and conditions and to generate replacement tissues for disfunctioning

cells or organs. 3 Research efforts have focused on spinal cord
injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease,

diabetes, and other diseases or conditions. Scientists hope to use
specialized cells to replace dysfunctional cells in the brain, spinal

cord, pancreas, and other organs. 4 The sources for stem cells
include: one week old embryos (blastocysts) created via in vitro
fertilization (IVF) to treat infertility; five to nine week old
embryos or fetuses obtained through elective abortion; embryos
created through IVF for research purposes; embryos created through
cloning or somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT); and adult tissues
(umbilical cord blood, bone marrow). Controversy surrounds the
derivation of stem cells from human embryos and fetuses. In order to
derive or extract the stem cells found within the embryo, the embryo
is destroyed in the removal process. The earliest embryonic stem
cells are called totipotent cells, which means they can develop into
an entire organism, producing both the embryo and tissues required to

support it in the uterus. At a later stage of development,
pluripotent embryonic stem cells exist and can develop into almost
any type of cell in the body. These stem cells cannot form the
supporting tissues, as seen with totipotent cells. 5 Human embryonic
stem cells found in the early stage embryo are believed to have a
greater ability to become different types of body cells and have more

uses than adult stem cells.

Background and Recent Presidential and Congressional Action=A0

Executive Action. When President Bush took office in January, 2001,
he announced he would conduct a review of the stem cell research
issue and ordered the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
to review the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) guidelines issued

by the former administration. During the review period, NIH suspended

its review of applications from researchers seeking federal funds to
perform human embryonic stem cell research. On August 9, 2001,
President Bush announced that federal funds would be available to
support limited human embryonic stem cell research. The new policy
provides that federal funds may be used for research on 64 existing
stem cell lines that have already been derived or were already in
existence as of the date of the announcement. In identifying the 64
stem cell lines as being eligible for federal funding, the President
said these embryos, from which the existing stem cell lines were
created, had been destroyed previously and could not develop as human

beings.

Under the new policy, federal agencies, primarily NIH, will consider
applications for funding if certain standards or eligibility criteria

are met. The White House fact sheet setting forth the President's
policy states: federal funds will only be used for research on
existing stem cell lines that were derived (1) with the informed
consent of the donors; (2) from excess embryos created solely for
reproductive purposes; and (3) without any financial inducements to
the donors. 6 The President directed NIH to examine the derivation of

all existing stem cell lines and create a registry of those lines.
Pursuant to this new policy, no federal funds will be used for: (1)
the derivation or use of stem cell lines derived from newly destroyed

embryos; (2) the creation of any human embryos for research purposes;

or (3) cloning of human embryos for any purposes. The new policy
replaces previously issued stem cell guidelines and policies. The
policy also requires the creation of the President's Council on
Bioethics to study stem cells and embryo research as well as other
issues. NIH has listed entities that have developed stem cells lines
that meet the President's criteria and are eligible for federal
funding (the Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry). The President also
stated that in FY2001, the government will spend $250 million on
research involving stem cells from other sources, e. g., umbilical
cord, placenta, adult and animal tissues.

Background and Congressional Activity. Prior to President Bush's stem

cell announcement, and over the past years, federal law has
prohibited HHS from funding human embryo research. No federal funds
have been used to support research on stem cells derived from human
embryos. Research in this area has been done through private funding.

Subsequent to several phases of action, in December 1994, President
Clinton, through an executive directive, prohibited federal funding
on research to support the creation of human embryos for research
purposes and directed NIH not to allocate resources for such
research. 7 The order banning funding for such research was followed
by a legislative ban in 1996 enacted in NIH's funding measure. 8
Congress has passed a similar ban annually since that time. The
original congressional ban stated that federally appropriated funds
could not be used for the creation of a human embryo or embryos for
research purposes or for research in which a human embryo or embryos
are destroyed, discarded, or knowingly subjected to risk of injury or

death greater than that allowed for research on fetuses in utero
under 45 C. F. R. 46.208( a)( 2) and 42 U. S. C. =A7 289g( b). The ban
defined "human embryo or embryos" to include any organism, not
protected as a human subject under 45 C. F. R. 46 (Human Subject
Protection regulations) that is derived by fertilization,
parthenogenesis, cloning, or any other means from one or more human
gametes (sperm or egg.) The rider language has not changed
significantly over the years. In the subsequent fiscal years after
FY1996, the rider was enacted in Title V (General Provisions) of the
Labor, HHS and Education appropriations acts. 9 The prohibition does
not ban fetal tissue research, although other restrictions apply. 10

Advances in medical science proceeded and in 1998 critical
developments were recognized by scientists at the University of
Wisconsin. These researchers were able to isolate human embryonic
stem cells and coax them to grow into specialized cells. In light of
the presidential and legislative bans, NIH requested a legal opinion
from the General Counsel of HHS on whether federal funds could be
used to support research on human stem cells derived from embryos or
fetal tissue. HHS' General Counsel, Harriet Rabb, concluded that then-

current law prohibiting the use of HHS appropriated funds for human
embryo research would not apply to research using stem cells "because

such cells are not a human embryo within the statutory definition."
11 General Counsel Rabb determined that the statutory ban on human
embryo research defines embryo as an "organism" that when implanted
in the uterus is capable of becoming a human being. The opinion
stated that pluripotent stem cells are not and cannot develop into an

organism, as defined in the statute. HHS concluded that NIH could
fund research that uses stem cells derived from the embryo by private

funds. But, because of the language in the rider, NIH could not fund
research that, with federal funds, derived the stem cells from
embryos.

Some members of Congress strongly opposed HHS' view and believed that

the legislative ban, that would continue through FY2001, covered and
prohibited such research. Others supported both the administration's
position and the funding of such research. In response to those
opposed to the HHS opinion, and the subsequently published NIH
guidelines, Secretary Shalala stated in a letter that the definition
of embryo used in the HHS legal opinion relied on the definition of
embryo in the statute and that the ban applied only to research in
which human embryos are discarded or destroyed but not to research
preceding or following "on such projects." 12 The letter stated:
"Moreover ... there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest
that the provision was intended to prohibit funding for research in
which embryos -organisms -are not involved."

After the HHS legal opinion, and despite expressions of congressional

opposition, NIH indicated that it would fund research on pluripotent
stem cells derived from human embryos and fetal tissue once
guidelines were issued and an oversight committee was established.
Draft guidelines were published in the Federal Register in December
1999 and final guidelines were issued in August 2000. 13 The
guidelines provided that studies utilizing pluripotent stem cells
derived from human embryos may be conducted using NIH funds only if
the cells were derived, without federal funds, from human embryos
that were created for the purposes of fertility treatment and were in

excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking such
treatment. Based upon HHS's interpretation, funds could not be used
to extract or derive the stem cells from the embryo, thereby
destroying the embryo. NIH initiated the applications process but
ultimately funding was not granted to the applications. The prior
administration's process was then overtaken by events and the new
policy was set.

In addition to President Bush's actions, congressional interest has
continued into the 107 th Congress. In July 2001, Senator Frist
outlined a ten-point plan that favored stem cell research and
included, in part, these points: (1) prohibit the creation of human
embryos solely for research purposes; (2) strengthen and codify the
ban on federal funding for the derivation of embryonic stem cells;
(3) prohibit cloning to prevent the creation and exploitation of life

for research purposes; (4) increase federal funding for adult stem
cell research; (5) allow federal funding for research using only
those embryonic stem cells derived from blastocysts that are left
over after IVF and would otherwise be discarded; and other points.

Various bills or initiatives have been introduced in the 107 th
Congress on stem cell research or cloning, which in some cases would
have an effect on stem cell research. The following highlights major
legislation or other initiatives that are likely to receive
additional legislative attention this session. On April 5, 2001,
Senator Specter introduced S. 723, the Stem Cell Research Act of
2001, which would amend current law and authorize NIH to fund the
derivation of stem cells from surplus IVF embryos. This type of
research activity is prohibited under the current Labor/ HHS
appropriation bill rider. The bill was referred to the Senate
Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. A companion bill

to S. 723, H. R. 2059, was introduced by Rep. McDermott. On May 1,
2002, Senators Specter, Feinstein, Hatch and Kennedy, as well as
other Senators, introduced S. 2439, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act

of 2002. This bill would prohibit human reproductive cloning but
would allow cloning for medical research purposes, including stem
cell research. The bill was referred the Senate Committee on the
Judiciary and is expected to receive heightened legislative
attention. H. Res. 17 was introduced by Rep. Maloney on January 30,
2001, expressing the sense of the Congress supporting federal funding

of pluripotent stem cell research. Other bills have been introduced
on stem cell research, but have not received extensive legislative
attention: the Responsible Stem Cell Research Act of 2001 (H. R.
2096; companion bill, S. 1349); the Stem Cell Research for Patient
Benefit Act (H. R. 2747); the New Century Health Advantage Act (H. R.

2838); and the Science of Stem Cell Research Act (H. R. 4011), which
was introduced in April 2002.

In addition to S. 2439, other cloning bills have been introduced that

implicate stem cell research. For instance, H. R. 2505, the Human
Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001 (Weldon) was introduced in July 2001
and would amend Title 18, U. S. Code, to prohibit human cloning. The
bill was approved by voice vote by the House Judiciary Subcommittee
on Crime on July 19, 2001 and approved by the full committee on July
24, 2001. 14 The House passed H. R. 2505 on July 31, 2001. The bill
was received in the Senate, and the last action was August 8, 2001.
15 H. R. 2505 has received support from the Administration. While
this bill is referred to as a cloning bill and would ban the process
of human cloning called somatic cell nuclear transfer when used for
reproductive purposes as well as for research and therapeutic uses,
it would restrict stem cell research. In addition, Sen. Brownback's
bill, S. 1899, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001, the
companion bill to H. R. 2505, was introduced January 28, 2002 and is
expected to receive legislative attention this session. As with H. R.

2505, the Administration has expressed support for S. 1899. The
Senate also considered, but did not pass, Senator Lott's amendment to

H. R. 10, the Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of
2001, which would have imposed a 6-month moratorium on all human
cloning research and would have affected stem cell research.

Legal Activity. Several lawsuits have been filed relating to stem
cell research issues. In March 2001, a lawsuit was filed in federal
court to stop federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research
and to overturn the NIH guidelines. In Nightlight Christian
Adoptions, et al. v. Thompson, 16 the plaintiffs sought declaratory
and injunctive relief and challenged the NIH guidelines for the
public funding for research involving stem cells derived from human
embryos. The plaintiffs, a non-profit adoption agency and others,
claim that the NIH guidelines authorizing such research violate the
legislative ban found in the appropriations rider which prohibits
federal funding of research in which a human embryo is destroyed,
discarded, or knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death greater
than allowed for research on fetuses in utero under 45 C. F. R
46.208( a)( 2) and 42 U. S. C. =A7 289g( b). 17 The plaintiffs
challenge NIH's interpretation that the ban on funding of research
using human embryos does not cover embryonic stem cell research, as
long as the embryos are not destroyed using federal funds. The
complaint states the NIH guidelines are arbitrary and capricious
within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. =A7
706( 2), not the product of reasoned decisionmaking, and inconsistent

with scientific evidence. A stipulated motion to stay the case was
issued in May, 2001, which essentially suspended the lawsuit while
the President conducted his review of the NIH guidelines. Although
events may have overtaken this lawsuit and rendered the claims moot,
the case is still pending before the court.=A0 In May 2001, a federal
lawsuit was filed claiming the Bush administration illegally withheld

federal funding for stem cell research. In Thomson v. Thompson 18 ,
actor Christopher Reeve and seven scientists filed suit in the U. S.
District Court for the District of Columbia claiming the
administration was doing irreparable harm by delaying the development

of therapies that could, the plaintiffs argued, save lives. The case
challenges new administration's decision to halt funding and the
directive to Secretary Thompson to review the NIH guidelines. The
plaintiffs claim that administrative procedures were not followed in
halting the research that, they argue, is permissible under federal
statute.

Another legal action involves licensing, patent, and intellectual
property right issues relative to stem cell research. In 1999, Geron
Corp. obtained an exclusive license from the Wisconsin Alumni
Research Foundation (WARF) for human embryonic stem cell technology
developed by Dr. Thomson of the University of Wisconsin. The license
grants Geron exclusive commercial rights to develop six types of
human cells, e. g., nerve cells, heart and liver cells, derived from
stem cells. Later, Geron attempted to exercise its option on
commercial rights to additional (12) cell types but WARF countered
that the option had expired. On August 13, 2001, the foundation filed

a lawsuit 19 in U. S. District Court in Madison, Wisconsin asking the

court to declare Geron's exercise of the option invalid. WARF later
amended its complaint to ask the court to declare that Geron's
license does not cover rights to research products that might be
developed from the stem cells. Geron has asked the court to decide
the dispute by discerning the meaning of the agreement without a
trial. 20

In September 2001, NIH began discussions with WARF concerning access
by federally-funded researchers to human embryonic stem cells. WARF
is said to hold patents affecting 64 stem cell lines, including
absolute rights to five lines. 21 Secretary Thompson announced that
an agreement has been reached with WARF that allows federal
researchers access. Notwithstanding these developments, the Geron
case raises legal questions concerning intellectual property rights,
patents, licensing, and contract rights. The case also raises
questions concerning the degree to which licensees or patent holders
will make cells available or impose conditions on their use. Current
guidelines on research do not reach the specifics of licensing
agreements between grant applicants and patent holders. Those parties

may negotiate agreements to license, share, and use the subject
matter of the agreement.

One wonders if the Bush folk plan to set up a FEMA Branch in Lebanon??

How many countries will have Bush & Co. destroyed by the time this President
leaves office: Iraq, Lebanon, ...  All in the name of establishing a "New
Middle East."

What more global environmental destruction can they take credit for by
ignoring and not responding to Global Warming.

There is perhaps an apocryphal story that pipes and the plumbing profession
were created when rising rivers - in the middle ages - brought human sewage
into peoples homes, the markets, etc.

No crisis, no cure.

At least, I suggest, people call the White House, the Israeli Embassy, one's
members of Congress and insist on an immediate cease fire so that talks can
begin and that the destruction of Lebanon by US Arms and Israel  immediately
stop.

If there is a protest demo, go.

The sewage is more than rising.

Just reading account at a web site by a Canadian who was able to leave
Lebanon by being married with his German girlfriend--the Germans being very
efficient and competent in evacuating their citizens.  (And Canadians,
not--)
       The writer notes no one going to cover what is happening in Southern
Lebanon--considered "suicide" to do so-- so he is sending what he saw--the
Israelis tell people to flee the area--but have bombed all the roads and
bridges, making escape from area next to impossible.  Now the real work can
begin--bombing cars and vans on the roads--hospitals bombed, school filled
with refugees bombed, an entire village wiped out, all water, food and
medicine is cut off--any vehicle is bombed or shot with the justification
that it may be carrying weapons for Hezbollah.  And since people were warned
to leave, if they are staying--well, their bad.
         Oh yes--remember all the celebration and congratulation on the news
the Syrians were lleaving?  There was something very convenient in everyone
believing that the Syrians had assasinated the Lebanese leader which caused
this pull out.  Syria always denied any connection--after all would not have
been in their interest.  Then whose?

I have no idea -- For all I know, it could have been instigated by the Syrians
-- or not -- but we do know that the contingency plans the IDF has been
following have been in readiness for some time, simply awaiting the required
contingency --

I love how, in digest form, the conversation oscillated
between discussions of the war and proper responses to it,
and the pros and cons of black/white background/text.  To
read a digest is to experience the kind of poetic leaping
that would make a surrealist blush.

Anyway, about the war: if you haven't, please do check out
Jewish Voice for Peace and of course Electronic Intifada and
Electronic Lebanon for some progressive views and things to
do (like contact our congresspeople).  While we wring our
hands, the zealots engage in political pressure.  There's no
time to feel sorry for ourselves or wonder what poetry can
do--we just need to leap the gap.

NOTE that this represents a partial change from our planned schedule. We're
very
fortunate that Philip Jenks is able to read in place of Stephen-Paul Martin.

Subtext continues its monthly series of experimental writing with readings
by
Philip Jenks (Portland) & John Olson at Richard Hugo House on Wednesday,
August
2, 2006.  Donations for admission will be taken at the door on the evening
of
the performance.  The reading starts at 7:30pm.

Philip Jenks' poems have appeared in LVNG, Chicago Review, and Pulmonar. His
first full-length book of poems, entitled ON THE CAVE YOU LIVE IN, was
published
by Flood Editions.  More recently, Zephyr Press published MY FIRST PAINTING
WILL
BE "THE ACCUSER". He lives in Portland, OR.

"Inspired speech recording its own fall into dead letter, the poems of
Philip
Jenks are strange, original, terrifying.  A stuttered apocalypse, they
affirm
our fellowship with all matter while suffering divinity’s perpetual
departure
from our midst."
-Benjamin Friedlander

John Olson is the author of FREE STREAM VELOCITY (2003), a collection of
prose
poems, and ECHO REGIME (2000) a collection of poetry, both from Black Square
Editions; EGGS & MIRRORS (1999), a chapbook of vignettes & prose poems
published
by local printer Paul Hunter, at Woodworks Press; and LOGO LAGOON (1999), a
collection of prose poems, from Paper Brain Press in San Diego. His essays,
articles, literary criticism, poetry and short stories have appeared in
numerous
journals, including New American Writing, Talisman, Sulfur, First Intensity,
American Letters & Commentary, the American Book Review, Denver Quarterly,
3rd
Bed, 5 Trope, Bird Dog, Monkey Puzzle, The Raven Chronicles, the Seattle
Weekly,
and The Stranger. "Dylan Goes Magenta," an essay on Bob Dylan's Tarantula,
appears online at Titanic Operas. His essay "Inebriate Of Air" appears in
the
anthology Writing On Air, from M.I.T. Press.

The future Subtext 2006 schedule is:

<< The Eliot branch has gone off in another direction.>>

Hi George Thompson, good to read you again--

I may not be a card-carrying member of this list--I mean in the eyes of
other people. And I certainly have my moments with Tom, with "Rachel =
_n=E9e_
Rabinovitch" and such.=20

But if the Eliot branch has gone off in another direction, and can't =
find
its way home, that would be nothing but an impoverishment for our tribe. =
So
I devoutly hope it isn't so.

Besotted with both Eliot and WCW,

Rachel L.

P.S. A small counterexample:


DEAR POSSUM


I thought death had undone about that many. A few more, a few less. It =
was
hard to miss them at the post office.

But there are master lists of the undone, databases. You can look them =
up on
Google. Insurance companies maintain them.=20

South of San Francisco there=92s an entire city of the dead, called =
Colma. You
can see it from the freeway.

Wyatt Earp is undone there, in his Stetson.

George Bowering wrote:

"That's odd, because back in the early sixties Duncan told me and my =
friends
to read Eliot, reluctant as we WCW fans were."

Hello George,

I just read these lines from *Bending the Bow* the other day ["passages =
24",
p.78]:

Down this dark corridor, "this passage," the poet reminds me,

	and now that Eliot is dead, Williams and H.D. dead,
	Ezra alone of my old masters alive, 	let me
		acknowledge Eliot was one of them,	  I was
	   one of his,   whose   "History has many
	     cunning passages, contrived corridors"

	comes into the chrestomathy.


When I said  "Of course, as far as this list is concerned Eliot was a
dead-end," what I meant was that the Poetics List in general belongs to =
the
"Williams" branch of the poetic tree.  The Eliot branch has gone off in
another direction.  Maybe I'm wrong about this, but I've been reading =
this
list for years and I don't recall very much interest in Eliot.  By the =
way,
the reason why I am on this list is that I have belonged to the =
"Williams"
branch too.

Also, Diane, I apologize for the confusion.  I don't have the passage at
hand, so I'm the one who is confused.  But in any case, the discussion =
has
gotten me to re-read Duncan and Hesiod, and that is good.  I've been
thinking a lot about Duncan, and San Francisco, and Berkeley, lately.

Best to you both,

George

Does anyone by any chance know the Alvin Curran score that opens - and runs
through most of - Rudy Burckhardt's film "Ostensibly?" I'm not familiar with
much of Curran's music, but I love the piece that Burckhardt chose to
accompany the images.

Thanks in advance,

Hi Tom,

It's not the women thing, exactly--that's more a symptom than the diesease
itself. Which I would diagnose as a basic dourness. . . Hard to put into
words.


BTW, dourness might be the term for Eliot too. Don't know. I remember first
reading him in high school at 15 and feeling sorry for the guy, and more
than a bit annoyed at his insistence on GLUM. (On the personal level, I
guess I'd OD'ed on "glum" at home, being a depression child.)

Enough for now.

D. di P.

Showcasing internationally acclaimed poet, Adeena Karasick, the luminous
slide and video projections of Blaine Speigel and the layered compositions of T
elefunk Sound System (Dan Driscoll and Steve Richman), this polyglossic
performance features a homolinguistic translation of the "oldest and most mysterious"
of all Kabbalistic texts, The Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Creation).

Through a process of recombination and permutation of letters, sounds,
rhythms, textures, this translation or "trance hallucination" will present an
audible reverberation of an intra-lingual, cultural and geo-poetic history,
experienced though a fragmented network of echoes, traces, ghostly remnants, sites of
desire.

Layering the poetic translations of the Aramaic, ancient and modern Hebrew
with English, this performance will pay homage to how this sacred Kabbalistic
tome (which details the creation of the universe through letters), pulses
through our every day lives.

In the beginning there was repetition, reproduction. translation.

age 15 was about when I started reading him, too, but I recognized my

Hi Tom,

It's not the women thing, exactly--that's more a symptom than the
diesease
itself. Which I would diagnose as a basic dourness. . . Hard to put into
words.


BTW, dourness might be the term for Eliot too. Don't know. I remember
first
reading him in high school at 15 and feeling sorry for the guy, and more
than a bit annoyed at his insistence on GLUM. (On the personal level, I
guess I'd OD'ed on "glum" at home, being a depression child.)

Enough for now.

I've thought that that was kind of strange too, particularly since pound is the worst classicist of them all. I'd never considered it before, but i think you might be on to something there. An "IT=Roman/Hellenic culture" formulation would certainly do some work for me towards understanding The Cantos.

That having been said, I was fifteen when I read The Hollow Men and Ash Wednesday, which were my first forays into Eliot. Maybe TS Eliot is the fifteen year olds' modernist. Although a friend of mine's son is completely enamored with Prufrock to the point that he's trying to memorize it, and he's only ten.

Eliot loved English music hall--has an essay on it--
in a funny way he's a bit like the Beatles when it comes to doing pop
songs--even with glumness, he has that kind of pop song quality to his
sounds, rhymes--images--very easy to hear and get stuck in one's head--

I keep listening to this interesting (Pound, Eliot, WCW) discussion with
another (scorched!) ear to what we now hear from contemporary Lebanon,
Israel.
Eliot in Lebanon. In Israel.
WCW or Pound in both or either.
The improvisatory character of WCW's prosody - and his enthusiasm to be in
an open dialog with 'the other'  would perhaps work best, if at all.
Titles like Kora in Hell, and The Wasteland, however, seem possibly spot-on.

How to embrace facts on the ground into a 'poetic clarity' - however that is
done - without becoming a journalistic media hit man (i.e., transitional)
seems the challenge.

But as either both teacher and/or poet, it's intriguing, I think, to face
the challenge of embracing these new spaces/cultures with which we are now
conjoined (such a horror filled embrace with which our bizarre leaders have
given us over). It invites issues of tone and prosody and how to employ or
un-employ the inheritances (literary) that we have been given.

I and some friends have been reading a bunch of Euripides' tragedies, The
Trojan Women, Electra, The Bacchae - as mandarin as superficially that might
seem. The work is so contemporary to this time, I think his ghost must be
floating around the bedrooms, hearts and souls of all our current favorite
folks in court or out. Such a pleasure to read.

>>GRANTS: creative capital/andy warhol foundation
arts writers' grant program
===============================================

Creative Capital/Andy Warhol
Foundation Arts Writers' Grant Program

Deadline: September 18, 2006

The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts
( http://www.warholfoundation.org/ ) has announced the launch of
a new initiative for arts writers to be administered by Creative
Capital ( http://www.creative-capital.org/ ). The Creative
Capital/Andy Warhol Foundation Arts Writers Grant Program is a
three-year initiative designed to support writers working on
contemporary art.

The program aims to promote critical discourse that is both
rigorous and accessible, to foster innovation in arts writing,
and to encourage writing that nurtures connections between art
and the public at large.

The program will recognize and support the contribution of
individual arts writers through project-based grants ranging
from $3,000 to $50,000 each. The program will support
approximately twenty projects per annual grant cycle.

Awards will be given for book projects, essays, and experiments
in new forms and media (Internet, radio, broadcast, etc.).
Contemporary art historians, critics, curators, journalists, and
experts from other disciplines who focus on the visual arts are
invited to apply.

Applicants must be a United States citizen, permanent resident of
the United States, or possessor of an O-1 visa; at least 25 years
of age; and a published author (work published in college news-
papers and undergraduate student-run publications will not be
considered toward this requirement).

Applicants cannot be a full-time student in a degree-granting
undergraduate or masters program or its equivalent at the time
of application. Please note, however, that Ph.D. students are
eligible to apply.

The Creative Capital/Andy Warhol Foundation Arts Writers' Grant
Program is part of the Andy Warhol Foundation's new Arts Writing
Initiative, a three-year, $3 million pilot program to support
independent, progressive, nonprofit arts publications and
individual arts writers.

See the Creative Capital Web site for complete program guide-
lines. The application will be posted online on August 14, 2006.

Dear Friends,

I have a new book out from Dusie Press, a new press based in Switzerland and
run by the poet Susana Gardner. It's the first book from this press.

It's poems (134 pages of em) I wrote 1992-2002, many of them side by side
with the ones in Chantry (indeed they are sister-books).

If you are interested, there are excerpts here
http://elizabethtreadwell.com/elizabeth/html/online_work.html
and Dusie Press is here
http://www.dusie.org/dusiepress.html.

That's all! If you'd rather not get such announcements, please just let me
know.


Warm regards, Elizabeth

The thing that is important about Eliot is that he first articulated a
Wasteland account of early 20th century Euro-culture. He perceived and
articulated better than anyone else before him, I think, the collapse of
all Euro claims to moral, ethical, and aesthitic primacy.  No, he knew
damned well that we had become "the hollow men."

And here we are a hundred years later, and still the hollow men lead us:
Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, el al.

What was grotesque then is still grotesque now.

Where I parted with him was his turn to conseravtive Christianity, and
to its conservative aesthetic. In my view, he stepped up to the abyss,
and then stepped back from it.   He couldn't jump.

Not very different from most of us really.

Please note that in today's commentary on his blog, Ron placed a link
into his text that is meant to stand as an example of my criticism. He
linked it to a very weird essay by Carlo Parcelli called "House Nigga,
Field Nigga."

I did not write that essay.

How very strange, I was just reading that essay yesterday after having found it at random through a google search and shaking my head at how bizarre it was. I think i like it taken as a creative work, but pretty much completely disagree with the premise, if I understand it at all. Which maybe i don't. Yeah, I like it.

For those who read this should/after Silliman fixes the link, the essay in question is: http://www.flashpointmag.com/house.htm

I can see why Gudding wouldn't want people to think he was the author of that
essay -- among other things, because he's one of the targets of Parcelli's bile
in the piece.

Having just listened to that speech by Malcolm X again, I found Carlo's use of
the figure all the more bizarre.  (Anybody here old enough to remember the
inane "student as nigger" pamphlet that made the rounds in the 60s?  I recall
one of my friends a few years back, seeing yet another phenomenon on the order
of Carlo's essay, responding to the effect that "now everybody's a nigga except
us black folk.")

I, too, watched Andrei Codrescu perform his odd audience act in Baltimore back
then -- maybe the same night Carlo is remembering -- I also attended readings
by Carlo himself, and have read some of his books -- Tried to talk to him once
when he was working at a book store south of Dupont Circle -- can't say it was
an experience that encouraged me to try again --

Carlo of course was kicked off this list... a while back... when the =
list
was more about discussing, and, from what I recall, heated defenses of =
the
seemingly insupportable essay would now be flashing in and out of our
mailboxes, pointing at various people.

Silliman's fixed his link, which was to be to an eight? year old essay =
of
Gabe's,=20

http://www.flashpointmag.com/guddin~1.htm

made me wonder between S's "tastelessness" in G, vs. KSM's and others'
vision for flarf and search-engine-sourced-poetry characteristics they'd
deem "flarfiness" which KSM relates to workshop competencies, badness, =
etc.

It is interesting, in this light, to read the female modernists such as
Ridge, Scott, etc. plus the (female) Monroe Poetry crowd as =
non-(EL)Masters,
Lindsays, Sandburgs, falling back into sonnet and song -- to prove
competency, perhaps, one is always asked to prove competency -- but
Eliolliams did it differently.

All best,
Catherine Daly

I agree.  Besides being offensive (I don't care as much about the use of the
N word so much as the patently insulting absurdity of comparing being a
contemporary poet with being a slave) it was just so whiny and
self-justifying. This tired, worn out "oooohhh, poor me, I'm a poet" crap
really gets old.

Am I really supposed to boo hoo because Andrei Codrescu threw a match at him
in Baltimore back in the seventies, and (ooooh! Sin!) now Codrescu has the
audacity to be successful?

Isn't one Dan Schneider enough?

first essay.  What a mistake.

from the article, item in question:

I chuckled when I heard that Gabe Gudding had been a Nation's younger poet. I
can't imagine a poet with less backbone. Gudding even went crawling back to
the Buffalo Poetics list when that group of paranoid sycophants threw him off
years ago. If he didn't have the cajones to stand up to that gaggle of twits,
what would he do if the FBI came around asking about a fellow poet? If his
actions heretofore are any indication, he'd rat them out. Such is the current
level of committment and integrity emanating from the Nation. Oh. And did I
mention that the poetry at the Nation is worthless pap?

By terms of the essay, I myself am a paranoid field nigger who reads mentally
stable house niggers most.  You might say that is a good thing, too.
Sometimes I do read a fellow yellow field nigger or, better yet, a red free nigger (I
wish he had given a fuller bibliographic list of those).  In fact, workshop
consists in reading field niggers' work.  One or two of those will advance from
the barn to the house.  The rest will leave the barn and go back out to the
field, temporarily stoked on field niggers' fallible styles and untested
awareness, to try to survive reading life outside comfortable halls and rooms.

This might seem too rude to mention, except here: an alcoholic man actually
called me a "niggy" once because I'd been cleared out of AA for trying to stand
by a Jewish mom in there who was getting evicted from her real house and torn
away from custody of her daughters by her ice-cream-scarfing, woman-hating,
fat dreck of a husband from Wyoming.  Standing up for someone who is in the
right, against public resistance, is the opposite of selling out.  Weird thing
is, there really is no world outside of AA -- or the poetics list; by house
masters' terms -- poetic AAs want in the house, too; and there are only a few
places for ex-barn fallows like us to shelter.  May go ask the fox.

IF I do, then: I think I shall post my not-for-sale story, "The Gift," at
annbogle.blogspot.com.  Instead of house and field niggers, it portrays program
faculty and writers as students and patients of the Art Hospital.  The story
dates to '91.  It's interesting that pharmaceutical co's have picked up in U
financing where the Cold War trickle down left off, but I wouldn't have known
that then.

I have no idea what a Nation's younger poet is, but if Gabe is one it
must be good: Gabe writes corageous, risky poetry, and he's one of
the very few of his generation worth reading.

Who needs Carlo Parcelli if we still have Bogle among us?

For me the bizarreness was in the choice of metaphor, this idea that american poetry is a peculiar institution in the same way that american slavery was a peculiar institution. Slavery was a peculiar institution because it was an all out assault on the human dignity of everyone who participated in it. It was peculiar because it was legally recognized by a nation whose founding documents purported to espouse a humanitarian and self-evident dogma that everyone is equal and possessed of rights. There is then this contradiction between the principles of the state and it's actions. Such contradictions are inevitable in a democratic and open society, indeed, i think they are essential to it. But to make that as a metaphor for American Poetry qua institution is to say something very strange: that there is a contradiction inherent in pursuing a particular artform with the values of those participating
in the artform. What values might those be? What poetic values does XJ Kennedy share with Jorie Graham share with Susan Howe? And more importantly, where does this binary situate, given that there are in fact four parties involved in the metaphor as it's analyzed, first the distinction between House and Field, sure, but also slave and master, slave and freeman, and freeman and slaver? I think the bizarreness is interesting when you start pushing at the metaphor for the other parties to it. Where are the abolitionists and former slaves? What is the underground railroad of American poetry? Who are the conflicted Thomas Jefferson's and sly politicians like John Quincy Adams? Is John Ashbery the Frederick Douglas of American poetry?

Of course Parcelli is writing a polemic and isn't interested in pursuing those questions, but once the weird analogy is drawn, i find it difficult not to try to follow the logic of the device. Which, for me at least, makes for very entertaining reading.

I agree.  Besides being offensive (I don't care as much about the use of

...July 19 events in some two dozen cities worldwide called for regime
change in Iran. And the annual “World Pride” march —incongruously themed
“Love without Borders”—was scheduled to take place in occupied Jerusalem
on Aug. 10, making Israel appear to be a bastion of liberty in the
Middle East.But Israel—the apartheid, theocratic imperialist power
threatening the entire Middle East—was blasting the population and
infrastructure of Gaza and pounding Lebanon with U.S.-supplied bunker
buster bombs...Like the German Homosexual Eman cipation movement, which
was derailed when it supported is own ruling class on the eve of World
War I, any progressive movement that does not fight its own imperialist
bosses and oppose a war for an empire built on super-profits surrenders
its independence and kneels before its own oppressor class. The gay
liberation struggles in the U.S. during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s
gained power from organizing against the Korean and Vietnam wars.


Struggle over Middle East reaches into world LGBT movements
Published Jul 27, 2006 12:18 AM

Imagine a group of individuals standing on the deck of an imperialist
gunboat, under the shadow of cannons aimed and readied to fire at a
country—formerly or currently colonized. The group is shouting at the
targeted government, “We demand your surrender too, but for progressive
reasons!”

That’s the position of those based in the imperialist U.S., Britain and
France who are directing their political fire against the popularly
elected Palestinian and Iranian leaderships, based on what they say are
violations of gay rights in those countries.

Their political campaign has ratcheted up. July 19 events in some two
dozen cities worldwide called for regime change in Iran. And the annual
“World Pride” march —incongruously themed “Love without Borders”—was
scheduled to take place in occupied Jerusalem on Aug. 10, making Israel
appear to be a bastion of liberty in the Middle East.

But Israel—the apartheid, theocratic imperialist power threatening the
entire Middle East—was blasting the population and infrastructure of
Gaza and pounding Lebanon with U.S.-supplied bunker buster bombs, while
the U.S. Navy Central Command was positioning its war armada off
Lebanon’s shores.

On July 21, the Israeli government canceled the pride march. The stated
reason was that the widening war was drawing troops and police who would
be needed to guard the march. The unstated reason is that the Israeli
coalition government needs to cement unity with its own theocratic base.
The Israeli ruling coalition faced a motion of non-confidence from two
religious parties within its government on July 10 that demanded the
cancellation of the march in Jerusalem.

Taking aim at Palestine

The July 19 events were taking aim at Iran—drawing handfuls of
individuals in some cities, scores in others—at the same time that the
Palestinian and Lebanese people were at ground zero of the bombs and
bullets. This widening Israeli assault in the region—a proxy war waged
in the economic, strategic and military interests of U.S. finance
capital—is also aimed at Iran, as well as Syria.

The call for anti-Iran events on July 19 was issued by OutRage!, a
British gay human rights group, and the Paris-based International Day
Against Homophobia.

On the day of the July 19 anti-Iran events, Peter Tatchell, an OutRage!
leader, issued a political statement from London in which he argued
against the progressive movement boycotting “World Pride” in Jer u
salem, which had not yet been canceled.

Tatchell claimed that opposition to the Jerusalem march was coming from
groups based in Western countries—a criti cism more accurately leveled
at his July 19 anti-Iran organizing.

As the Israelis laid siege to Gaza, Tatchell said his organization would
actually prefer that the march be scheduled in Palestinian Ramallah
rather than Jeru salem. But he added that news coverage of the Jerusalem
“World Pride” event would “give comfort and hope to isolated, downcast
queers throughout the Arab world.”

He concluded, “Imagine the hope and confidence such news will give to
isolated, vulnerable LGBT people across the Middle East,” and that the
event “might help trigger the creation of LGBT movements in repressive,
homophobic Middle Eastern states, including Palestine.”

Voices from within Palestine and Lebanon sent a very different message.

Voices from Palestine

There already is a lesbian, bisexual, trans gender, queer and
intersexual (LGBTQI) organization in historic Pales tine. It is called
“Aswat”—which translates from Arabic to English as “Voices.” Aswat works
with LGBTQI groups and individuals in the Middle East.

Aswat raised its voices early on regarding the Jerusalem march.

In the English portion of its web site, Aswat states clearly that as
Palestinian LGBTQI’s living directly under military occu pation, and as
part of a national min ority in Israel, “[W]e are opposing this attempt
to hold the international pride parade in Israel, particularly in
Jerusalem, the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As the pride
parade will be at a time for the gay and lesbian community to cele
brate, Palestinians in Eastern occupied Jeru salem will continue to
suffer under intensified checkpoints, increasing racism, house
demolishing, confiscating IDs and expanding of Israeli settlements.

“Therefore, ASWAT—a Palestinian gay women group—decided not to take part
in the World Pride 2006.”

A promotional DVD for the Jerusalem events had promised “great parties”
and stressed that “out” gay and lesbian soldiers can fight in the
Israeli Army. The propaganda DVD denounced the Palestinian Authority for
its alleged treatment of its same-sex-loving population and claimed that
the Palestinian resistance—the Intifada—made it harder for lesbian and
gay Palestinians to “escape” to Israel. (The Coalition to Boycott World
Pride)

Aswat emphasized that these are soldiers in an occupying, oppressive
army. “This is an insult to our struggle for freedom and tolerance. In
Israel, violence and hatred are articulated through homophobia and
xenophobia, and this very same violence is evident in racism, occupation
and war crimes.”

In a recent interview, Aswat co-founder and group coordinator Rauda
Morcos explained, “We are focusing on our work within the Palestinian
community. We believe we need to have our allies within the community
before having them around the world. This is very important because
without the support of our community, we cannot exist. The other thing
we are focusing on is deliberating the change that is happening within
the Palestinian community without comparing that to what is happening in
the world. Each community has its own ways, its own scale, its own time,
and our time has started, and we’re happy with that.”

When asked how Palestinians viewed her as an “out” lesbian, Morcos
concluded, “I think Aswat’s existence proves there are seeds of change.
I think we are on the agenda—of the Palestinian social agenda. I think
we’re there, and I think it’s very important that the change has to
happen. I think it wouldn’t happen without Aswat, and it wouldn’t happen
without the support within the community and without having supportive
media in our community.” (gay.com)

Lebanese support for Palestine

The group Helem (translated into English as “dreams”) describes itself
in the English-language portion of its Arabic website as a non-profit
organization in Lebanon, working on various human rights issues,
including LGBTIQ equality.

As part of its emergency action under Israeli bombardment, the website
explains that the Helem center is helping to provide shelter, food and
other supplies to the refugees who have poured in from the southern
suburbs of Beirut and the south of Lebanon. (helem.net)

The organization states, “Helem supports the global movement to boycott
Jerusalem World Pride 2006 as part of the international boycott of, and
divestment from Israel. Helem strongly condemns holding World Pride in a
city beleaguered by violence and conflict, and where the words ‘Love
without Borders’ belie a reality of separation, ubiquitous borders,
destruction of homes and livelihoods, land theft, gross human rights
violations and the apartheid policies of Israel.”

Helem concluded that, “the rights of gays, lesbians, bisexuals and
transgenders should not be placed in competition with the long struggle
of the Palestinian people, including Palestinian LGBT people, for
self-determination, for the right to return to their homes, and the
struggle against apartheid and the occupation of their lands.”

Progressive opposition to the week of “World Pride” events in Jerusalem
had been building around the world. The march—expected to draw tens of
thousands—would have violated the widening call to boycott Israel,
infused the settler state’s tourism economy with cash, and politically
promoted the Israel settler state as a “democracy” in the Middle East.

Faisal Alam, a gay Muslim of Pakistani descent who co-founded
Al-Fatiha—an international gay Muslim organization—wrote that the
Israeli occupation of Palestinians is so brutal that, “With this in
mind, I cannot support an event that will seemingly ignore the suffering
of Pales tinians—both queer and straight—in the Occupied Territories,
the West Bank and Gaza.” (southernvoice.com)

The Coalition to Boycott World Pride, which described itself as
“individuals and groups working for the liberation of all oppressed
peoples,” stressed that “LGBT, intersex and other queer-identified
people, should not be placed in competition with the long struggle of
the Palestinian people, including Palestinian LGBTIQ people, for
self-determination, for the right to return to their homes, and the
struggle against apartheid and the occupation of their lands. We urge
all people who seek peace and justice to support the travel boycott of
World Pride Jerusalem as part of the boycott of Israeli goods, and the
call to divest from Israel.”

Turn the political guns around!

This political struggle regarding Iran and Palestine takes place within
the context of a burgeoning battle between imperialism and the countries
of the Middle East that are resisting its demands to surrender their
sovereignty and right to self-determination.

Those who argue that Islam is the problem and that pressure from the
imperialist democracies—who have historically arrayed their forces under
the banner of Christianity—is the solution are lining up with the
oppressor in this war, not the oppressed.

It was colonialism and later imperialism that imposed anti-“sodomy”
laws—a term that comes from the Bible, not the Quran—from Africa to the
Middle East, from Asia to the Americas, in its effort to restructure
social relations in these countries to its economic interests.

The French Mandate imposed anti-sodomy laws in Lebanon; the British
Mandate made it law in Palestine.

Imperialism is not going to bring democracy as a form of state rule to
the Middle East or Central Asia or any other part of the world it seeks
to dominate economically.

In the imperialist centers, democracy is a form of class rule by the
capitalists over the vast laboring class. But even in a democracy, state
repression—particularly against nationally oppressed peoples within the
imperialist citadels—is cruel. And challenge to capitalist rule can
shift the form of state quickly to a more iron-fisted rule, as the rise
of fascism in Germany, Italy and Spain demonstrated.

Imperialist super-exploitation around the world requires a much more
brutal form of state dictatorship than democracy. The Iranian people
remember. They lived under a fascist “regime change” by the U.S. and
Britain that installed a king—the Shah—on the peacock throne.

Imperialism is not looking to bring “progress” to the oppressed.
Washington cheered the restoration of semi-feudal social relations in
Afghanistan after drowning in blood a democratic revolution there that
had been supported by the Soviet Union. And the CIA has brought medieval
torture techniques, employing anti-gay and anti-trans humiliation and
violence, to its makeshift prisons in Afghanistan and Iraq.

For decades, U.S. imperialism has waged a war to annihilate the
left-wing leaders of resistance movements in the Middle East and Central
Asia, creating a void that the Islamic forces are filling today.

So now, imperialism—which had relied on some of these same forces to
crush communist resistance in the region—has turned to Islam bashing as
its justification for economic and military warfare against any
government and people who resist its rule, from Afghanistan to Iraq,
Iran to Palestine.

Like the German Homosexual Eman cipation movement, which was derailed
when it supported is own ruling class on the eve of World War I, any
progressive movement that does not fight its own imperialist bosses and
oppose a war for an empire built on super-profits surrenders its
independence and kneels before its own oppressor class.

The gay liberation struggles in the U.S. during the 1950s, 1960s and
1970s gained power from organizing against the Korean and Vietnam wars.

It is too late to expose the pretexts and “justifications” for
imperialist war after the fact. The movement for sexual, gender and sex
liberation needs to turn its political guns around now on the real enemy
of the world’s people—imperialism! n

Mark, I think the essays at Flashpoint ought to be taken as published ones,
rather than as blog entries.  Either way, this mislinking at Silliman's blog
has led me to read something from the voice of an outsider, for a change, and
I'm glad of it, even though Carlo Parcelli mostly steps on toes in his piece.
The prose, instead of seeming too strange to read, strikes me as being strong
-- it's some sort of lit. crit. tapdancing -- and reminds me of reading at
Baraka's website.  I was impressed by such extended use of analogy throughout a
lengthy essay even if it does rely on outsider terminology.  It is so thorough
in its dismissal of so many writers:  Perhaps IT is supposed to be a seminal
critique.  John Gardner's ON MORAL FICTION, though certainly polite, stepped on
toes, too, albeit a different set than this does.  And it goes to show that no
matter how politely one goes about it, it is a difficult thing to suggest
bias.  Remember that Gardner chose Guy Davenport as one of the best writers then
living, while simultaneously dismissing many of the fashionable crowd of the
day (1982?).

Author bios:

Phil Hall lives in Toronto & Perth, Ontario. He has been publishing
poems since 1973. His book Trouble Sleeping (2001) was nominated for the
Governor General's Award. His most recent book An Oak Hunch was a finalist
for the Griffin Poetry Prize. This spring he was in writer's residence at
The Berton House in Dawson City, Yukon.

Jesse Patrick Ferguson is a poet, reviewer, musician and graduate student.
His work has appeared recently in dANDelion, The Nashwaak Review, Matrix
and The Dalhousie Review. He is also the author of three previous poetry
chapbooks: Near Cooper Marsh (Friday Circle, 2005), Old Rhythms (Pooka
Press, 2006) and Commute Poems (Thistle Bloom Books, 2006). In the fall
of 2006, he and his fiance will be relocating to Fredericton, NB to
continue their studies. He will be launching "catch a bird," a collection
of visual poems.

Wanda O'Connor once embraced a fond affection for trap shooting. Her
work has been published in such locations as Toronto, New York, Montreal,
Australia, and Fredericton, New Brunswick. She reads and reviews a variety
of books that make nothing happen.

Jennifer Mulligan will still be 31 at the staging of this event. She
writes poetry, screenplay-like things, and she likes to watch people. On
the average day, she attributes most of her rational/emotional life to
being a Virgo sun/Scorpio moon combo (imagine a Vulcan (Virgo) + an
Earthling (Scorpio) = SPOCK). Her work has appeared in YAWP, Peter F.
Yacht Club publications, above/ground press broadsides, and in the
chapbook Winter2 in celebration of Ottawas Winterlude. She is currently
finishing a series of six poems based on the work of the ancient Roman

I can't keep quiet any longer even though I have no time to get into this
discussion. But please think abt what you are saying. Israel--what is it to
do? It is a tiny country surrounded by tens of thousands of people who want
the Jews dead. If you have been there you know the situation is much more
complex than Israel imperialist--they are trying to survive. I wish people
wd get as worked up abt what is happening in southern Africa & other poor
parts of the world as they do abt Israel. Every day 60,000 people, 75% of
them women & children of color, die of hunger-related issues.Israel has don=
e
some things wrong but not the way you portray them. I am in general
extremely left-leaning but in the case of Israel, partly bec I am Jewish bu=
t
not only bec of that, I see many leftists overgeneralizing & blaming in a
knee-jerk way. Stop jerking those knees, please. Read the history of the
Middle East.

Yes, much more attention should be paid to events unfolding in Africa than is
currently being paid -- That, however, has little to do with how much attention
we should pay to what is unfolding in the Middle East.

It is BECAUSE I've read deeply in the history of these events that I have taken
the positions that I have taken.

It's about time to stop knee-jerk accusations of knee-jerk responses --

Even some on the far right have come to recognize that there will be no peace in
the region until Israel and its neighbors come to a lasting settlement.

Current Israeli and US policy appears to be that a settlement will be imposed
upon the Arab populations.  That will not work.

Israel continues to appeal to UN resolutions as justifictaion for its actions,
while studiously ignoring other UN resolutions and international law.

Any nation has a right to defend itself against incursions upon its territory.

No nation has a right to establish settlements on land it occupies in war, or to
generously offer to return all but 5% of such occupied territories, or to deny
citizens displaced from such lands the right to return to them, or to
appropriate the water resources in lands occupied in war -- etc.


Hezbollah has done terrible things.  There was no Hezbollah till Israel invaded
Lebanon.

Hamas has done terrible things.  Hamas came into being under the watchful eye of
Israeli intelligence at a time when Israel wanted a counterweight to the PLO.

This is not to say that Israel is responsible for the actions of Hamas or
Hezbollah -- It is not to blame the victims -- It is to say that the policies
Israel has pursued have never accomplished their stated goals.

The policies of collective punishment, wholesale removal of populations,
destruction of even purely civilian infrastructure, will never produce security
for Israel.

What is Israel to do?

Return to its internationally recognized '67 borders.  Defend itself against any
incursions, with the full support of the international community.

Israel has so far bombed something like 80% of all Lebanon's highways and 94% of
the bridges.  It has bombed a UN outpost with "smart" weapons after repeated
pleas from UN officials to stop firing on them. It has killed hundreds of
civilians.  I don't know anybody outside the Bush administration who believes
that this scorched earth policy can possibly lead to any improvement in
Israel's long-time security.

You may think otherwise;  I am sorry to say that we will have time to learn
whether or not you are right.

Why is it that that particular bit of rhetoric always
seems to clog the pipes of peace? Makes me think
of a film clip showing young Iranian women
demonstrating in Teheran, chanting "Death to
America" and then breaking off to chat happily
with a couple of Americans who happened to be
in the vicinity before resuming their marching and
chanting.

Because Israeli's and their supporters are just as caught up in the cycle of hatred and violence as their opponents, and that sentiment is exploited by power hungry, malevolent, right wing interests in the United States and Israel.

Yep, I started reading him around 14-15. He became one of my favourites,
along with Crane.
I didnt feel as if he was a downer.
I was kind of exhilarated.
Maybe because I was so much moved by the form,
as compared with, say, Arnold.

Can anyone explain what gives Israel - with the patent permission and
financial/military, etc. support - the right to destroy Lebanon (a sovereig=
n
country) and disperse its diverse population into a never ending - it will
seem -  Diaspora?? Over a million people already uprooted, habitat destroye=
d
- let alone the injured, killed!

What gives the USA - or let's what appears to be a Junta of its own
constitutional rules -  and Israel this exceptional right?

Ironically, it seems to me, Israel is doing to Lebanon precisely what it
fears most that may be done to itself. In fact, I am about to "x" every tim=
e
I hear Israel say that it's defending its right to exist. Would that it do
so for Lebanon and Palestine. Like, for example, negotiate in good faith
with both Palestinians and the Lebanese.

What is the USA interest here? Every time I see Condoleezza on the
television - giving her righteous 'creative birth pang chaos, let Israel
destroy as much of Lebanon as they can' speech (so that 'we' let Iran and
Syria know who's in charge of the Middle East), it is hard not see an
archival picture backdrop of the Chevron oil tanker that Chevron once
blessed with her name (before realizing, once she was in Bush's government
that the association was too transparent.)

It think it's histrionic to play the David and Goliath number as a means to
define Israel. It's definitely lined up with Goliath, 'us' - and we's
definitely having a hard time with the claws - whether it Afghanistan, Iraq
or Lebanon. This operation seems as witless as the one in Iraq.

In terms of the Arts, maybe it's becoming rapidly clear that restoring
Diplomacy as an Art might serve us all much better than this horrifying
craziness.

I've actually had the experience of negotiating with somebody who thought I
should not exist, but that's another story for another day.

When, exactly, has Israel "given up land"?  let alone "more" -- They have
withdrawn from land they occupied in war, following negotiations with the
parties with whom they had been at war. They have recently withdrawn from Gaza
-- but they have also gone back in when it suited them in response to attacks
mounted from Gaza.   Were they more vulnerable after the withdrawal from Gaza
than they were before?  To speak of giving up land implies that it was theirs
to give up.

The reasoning here is odd in the extreme.  It seems to hold that, since people
who don't believe Israel should exist threaten to attack Israel, therefore
Israel should annex lands they have occupied in war.  It seems to argue that to
withdraw from occupied territories in itself makes Israel more vulnerable.  And
it would seem to propose that Israel has the unlimited right to creat "buffer"
zones where and as it chooses for its own protection, which buffer zones
themselves could well require additional territorial buffering if Israel still
feels threatened.

As I said to a previous correpondent, you may well feel that by destroying the
infrastructure of Lebanon, creating hundreds of thousands of refugees and
killing hundreds, Israel becomes less vulnerable.  Sounds to me more like the
reasoning that must go on in the heads of Hezbollah, who seem to think that
attacking civilians in Israel is good for their cause.  Thanks to our
government's wink and nod, we will have time to see if that belief holds true.
Nobody is going to stop Israel, so we will see if this strategy makes them less
vulnerable in the long run.  It certainly doesn't look to me like it's worked
to that effect in the past.

Why do none of the posts address the rather unusual content of the initial batch of stories? The arguments over Palestine yesterday are the same ones that always happen, basically (not that I'm uninterested in reading intelligent people's rephrasings), whereas I hear very little about GLBTQI organizations in the Middle East... and it's crucial for western queers to be faced with the argument that their (our) failure to link their struggles with "seemingly unrelated" forms of oppression (i.e., those that aren't directly and exclusively "gay rights" issues) amounts to shooting themselves in their collective foot. This is especially needed in the most tolerant U.S. cities, where the assimilationist ideal tends to be strongest.

At the same time, it's equally crucial for straight progressives to take off the blinders and put some work into--or at least lend support for--less traditional left issues, like the backlash against all rights of queers of all kinds that's going on now. To abstain from fighting anti-gay marriage legislation, for instance, is utterly idiotic on the part of the various movements working for peace, human rights, and economic justice in other areas.

Thanks for the articles, which show that--at least in some places (and look which ones!)--these problems aren't thought of as disconnected.

cheers,

Andy

To put something in perspective, I wrote short stories steadily until 1991,
at the advent of the Gulf War, and would have continued, certainly -- one of
the war stories from '91, "What Kiss," was published in '93 in Gulf Coast --
except that a boyfriend of three months assailed me and threatened me on an
answering machine tape then took a position in my department, despite a kind of
quiet protest coming from my corner.  It is, I think, obvious how hard it would
be to protest anything successfully.  The upshot for me was that my
relationship with my own writing was threatened, never to return to the steady flow I had
enjoyed with it.  I have only written two short stories since then but have
written other things, mostly not available.  My blog is a notebook of mixing
genres, something I was pioneering then, in '91.

At a party at school, our "head of class," not the best writer nor the worst,
a gal, really, announced to my table that my voice was glamorous and that my
friend was cool.  We are still in this condition.  She is cool; my voice is
kind of nice or sweet.

My writing voice, however, is male, often, authoritative, sometimes.

I would make a reading tape, but I don't have audio on my pc.

We were popular in 4th grade, that group of girls, and then again at 25 --
more childish attacks had threatened my blossoming -- and then again at 35.
But, by 35, I was only popular in AA until I stood up for that Jewish woman then
I was hit, at my car, and the police interrogated me after I called them.

Even our Jewish man did not like that Jewish woman.  I was her ally, but I
was his, too.  I think it worried him that someone might try to matchmake him
with her since both were divorcing, and I could see it not working that way,
since he was more conservative and she was more reform.  Then he left town to
take a job, and the group got really horrid without him there.  It was like a
Tarrantino movie with lots of death.

Incidentally, the Jewish man, had his first poem published in The New Yorker
when he was 19 and a student at U of MN.  It was very strange and happy to
meet up with such a young starter as he in a rec room in a little side town in
AA.  He had lived for 18 years in Japan and was 50.  His wife had vetoed a
poetry career.  He was really very wonderful and knowledgable about literature and
religion and not in any way a program man.  He was intending to write fantasy
now that he was divorcing.  I'd like to know when I think about it: if cool is
what he was.  He was a business man, an exec. from Japan.  He gave the
impression of someone who had run down fifty flights of stairs away from a
downsizing; then there was nothing corporate for him to do here in the U.S.  I think he
was more mature than cool, actually.

Whether or not Israel shd be invading Lebanon is an open & complicated
question, and every human life is valuable, & what is happening there is
heartbreaking. That doesn't mean, however, that Israel is imperialist.
Withdrawing the pre-war borders is not going to solve all the problems of
dealing w/ people who want to see Israel destroyed. You cd say that war has
not helped the Middle East; you could also say that Israel wd have been
destroyed by now had it not fought at certain moments of its history.

Here's what Wikipedia has to say about Stewart Home:

  "Stewart Home (born 1962) is a British fiction writer, subcultural pamphleteer, underground art historian, and activist. His mother, Julia Callan-Thompson, was a model and hostess who was associated with the radical arts scene in Notting Hill Gate. She knew such people as the writer and situationist Alexander Trocchi. Stewart was put up for adoption soon after his birth.
  Home is probably best known for his parodistic pulp fictions Pure Mania, Red London, No Pity, Cunt, and Defiant Pose that pastiche the work of 1970s British skinhead pulp novel writer Richard Allen and combine it with pornography, political agit-prop, and historical references to punk rock and avant-garde art. In the 1980s and 1990s, he also wrote a large number of non-fiction pamphlets, magazines, and books. They chiefly reflected the politics of the radical left, punk culture, the occult, the history of Situationism, and other radical left-wing 20th century anti-art avant-garde movements. Often at the focal point of these reflections was Neoism, a subcultural network of which he had been a member, and from which he derived various splinter projects. A constant characteristic of his activism in the 1980s and 1990s was the use of group identities and collective monikers in his work, overt and up-front employment of plagiarism and, occasionally, pranks and publicity
 stunts."

  Stewart Home has a mini-manifesto up at PFS Post (http://www.artrecess.blogspot.com). It's sobering, sad, & very relevant to the political climate in the US & the UK. Please check it out.

I have never said that Israel should not have fought at certain stages of its
history.

I do say that establishing permanent settlements on land occupied in war and
claiming that those areas are now to be part of the nation is by definition
imperialism.

I have never said that withdrawing to prewar borders would solve all the
problems of the region.

I do say that those problems will not be solved if Israel continues to occupy
these lands.

"The American government is the largest and easily the most dangerous
terrorist organization in the world, and one of only a few (the British
government is another) with access to weapons of mass destruction."

an Israeli friend said that if Israel went to war again it would be "you

This morning, the first thing I did was to sit for an hour. I have done
that regularly for twenty years, and have spent many evenings, days and
weeks doing the same.

I would like to know myself. It is remarkable that while ordinarily we
spend most of our lives studying, contemplating, observing and
manipulating the world around us, the structured gaze of the thoughtful
mind is so rarely turned inwards. This avoidance must measure some
anxiety, reluctance or fear. [...]

Sitting helps me overcome my deepest fears. I become freer to live from
my heart and to face the consequences, but also to reap the rewards of
this authenticity. Much of what I called pain was really loneliness and
fear. It passes, dissolves, with that observation. The vibrations of my
body are humming the song that can be heard only when dawn and dusk are
simultaneous, instantaneous, continuous. I feel that a burst of stern
effort is a small price to pay to hear this inner music- fertile music
from the heart of life itself.

I sit to anchor and organise my life around my heart and mind, and to
radiate out to others what I find. Though I shake in strong winds, I
return to this basic way of living. The easy, soothing comfort and deep
relaxation that accompany intense awareness in stillness, peel my life
like an onion to deeper layers of truth, which in turn are scoured and
soothed until the next layer opens. I sit to discipline my life by what
is clear, simple, self-fulfilling and universal in my heart. There is no
end to this job. I have failed to really live many days of my life, but
I dive again and again into the plain guidance of self-containment and
loving receipt. I sit to find and express simple human love and common
decency.

I do think that the several references (truthful, I hasten to add) to those who
deny Israel's right to exist should not occur in a contextual vacuum.

What is the Israeli position on the right of Palestinians to exist, as
Palestinians?

It is, of course, a concept in evolution.

There was the infamous formulation of Golda Meir, who held that there simply is
no such thing as a Palestinian.

For many years the position was that Palestinians had the right to exist as
Jordanians, Egyptians, Lebanese -- but certainly not as Palestinians, and
certainly not on the lands they had previously lived on.

At the present time, it appears to be the position of Israel that Palestinains
MIGHT, at some date far in the future to be determined by Israel, have the
right to exist on a series of bantustans, with borders declared by Israel
itself.  Israel will continue to control the flow of tax monies, the flow of
water and the flow of people.  No Palestinians will be permitted to return to
homes they once owned within what will now be the borders of Israel; No
Palestinians will be comepensated for their lands, for the orchards or
pasturelands Israel has chosen to destroy, for the houses bulldozed by Israel,
etc. Israelis will be permitted to live permanently on lands taken in the wars.

Is that what is meant by the right to exist?

and that's my 2 message quota for the day --

I seem to have inadvertenly returned us to the debate about the relationship
between words and the actually existing.

This morning, the first thing i did was take three No-Doz and wash them down with a glass of Ice Earl Grey Tea. I have done that regularly for ten years. In the evenings days and weeks, I've often done the same, occassionally, or often, amping up my dosage to higher grade stimulants or other narcotics or alcohol. It's remarkable what a racing mind can accomplish when turned outwards at the fiery spectrum of creation, and how rare that certain American mind can be turned from the contemplation of the navel and it's self-centered simulacrum of eastern thought to explore the complexity and overwhelming divine bigness of the universe and complexity of human existence. This avoidance must measure some fundamental self-centeredness, selfishness, or immaturity.

Drugs help me overcome my deepest fears. These days i get by on caffeine nicotine alcohol and venlafaxine, with the occasional mammoth dose of over the counter pain killers to keep my migraines at bay. I take my daily regimen and I become freer, looser, and less likely to say things like "live from the heart." I realize that much of what I call pain was truly the fact that I am deeply skeptical of the cultural commodification of bits and pieces of other faiths, poorly understood, and essentialized as part of the wisdom of "noble brown savages" as yet another way that white American liberals make themselves feel better about themselves and their privileged position in the world, rendering themselves neutral, uncritical lumps with streams of nonsense like saying Dawn and Dusk are "simultaneous, instantaneous, continuous."

Now I go out into the world, and when I see people who need help, I help them. When I see injustice or racism, I challenge it. When I see some bullshit, I call it. Which is the only way i know of to find love and decency.

Thank you so much for putting these thoughts on the listserv today.  It so happens that I too practice the same meditation as you do and, because I had long awaited mail at the post office, cut my sitting short.  Thus it was good to be reminded of the correct practice.  Thankyou.

hi all

When you're done with your sitting meditation, depressed as hell about the middle east, and finished promoting your own stuff, go have a look at my stuff I'm promoting now:

Recently on Wet Asphalt:
"I think Derrida called it Hymen, so it's time to pop your cherries boys."
Some musings on binary analysis, money, contemporary literature, and what's to be done about it.

"Postmodern what?"
A short recommendation for our readers less familiar with poetry that they go out and get a copy of the Norton Anthology of Postmodern Poetry, preferrably by clicking the Wet Asphalt affiliate link.

and a two part take on Dante in our weekly column Reading vs. Watching, comparing books to television and movies. This week, it's the Inferno vs. Deadwood and the sparks will fly!

Instead of that, I read books.
I would like to know something other than myself.

Also wrong -- lines 13 ff in the Onion piece, that is, quoting:

        "At 750 years, the U.S. is by far the world's oldest surviving
democracy, and is certainly deserving of our         recognition," Wales
said.

Iceland is still a functioning democracy, and has been since before 1000CE,
which puts it at least 250 years ahead of the game.

Depends, I suppose, on how you define democracy, but I can't think off-hand
of anything that qualifies USAmerica, that Iceland doesn't and didn't have.
First.  Including too many damn lawyers in at the founding of the state.

(Incidentally, where did that 750 years come from?  What special happened in
1256?)

My name is Paul Catafago. I am a poet and director of the New York based arts non-profit Movement One: Creative Coalition (www.movementone.org).  For the past several days, I have read your posts and decided to respond.
  I am Palestinian (My father was born in Jaffa in 1911) and Lebanese (Beiruti from my mother's side) so I will tell you that your posts have been hurtful.
  I have very close relatives who live in Lebanon- including my 84 year old uncle who was displaced by Israel's agression. My uncle is not a member of Hizbollah (the propoganda machine has tried to convince people that all Lebanese who have suffered from Israel's agression are members of Hizbollah). He is in fact a Catholic monk who naturally doesn't like Israel much.
  I am not anti-semitic. In fact, I am a semite. However, the propoganda machine as well, of course, as the agressive tactics of the state of Israel, all fueled by pathetic and irrational fear sicken me.

  (ISRAEL IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST WITH NUCLEAR CAPABILITY- AND WHY IS THAT? WASN'T IRAQ INVADED AND EFFECITIVELY DESTROYED BY AMERICA BECAUSE THE U.S. FEARED THEY HAD "WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION" INCLUDING THE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE NUKES? SO WHY IS IT OK FOR ISRAEL TO HAVE THEM, AND NO OTHER STATE CAN?)

  There is a double standard here. No matter what reason you can give, no matter what explanation or justification, the fact is Israel operates under and over international norms.
  And the genius of the propoganda machine is that if anyone ever criticizes Israel, they are deemed "anti-semitic".

  Your fear that Israel will be destroyed as the safe haven for Jews has made you turn a blind eye on both reality and history. The fact is Israel has the world's fourth largest military and "enjoys" blind support of the US. The fact is, as well, throughout the years, Israel has overseen some of the most horrific acts of injustice in modern times.

  Have you heard of Sabra and Shatilla? These are two Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut. In 1982, shortly after Israel had invaded Lebanon under the command of Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, the Israelis dummied up documents to show the Lebanese Christian militia, the Phalangists, that the PLO had assasinated the charismatic Lebanese Christian President, Bashir Gemayel. The truth was that Gemayel was killed by Amal, a Syrian backed faction. But by lying to the Phalangists, Israel- specifically Sharon knew it would incite them to do something drastic against the PLO- essentially doing Israel's bidding.
  So an attack on these two refugee camps was suggested- and on September 12, 1982, the Phalangists began massacres in both the camps. By the end of it, thousands of inncoent Palestinians, HUMAN BEINGS, had been killed, under the watchful eyes of Israeli military leaders, reported to be watching the massacres from adjacent roofs.

  In the end, all of this doesn't matter, because by this time, after reading your posts, and witnessing your whimpering about being attacked by "progressives and leftists.", you still haven't admitted that Israel has done something wrong.

  I am not a terrorist. I am not anti-semitic. But I have lived in both Palestine and Lebanon (I heard an Israeli commentator the past few days say that the Lebanese- especially Christians are secretly admiring Israel for trying to take out Hizbollah. I will tell you this is a bold faced lie. I am not commenting on Hizbollah here- but I will say the Lebanese Christians I know (my family is Christian) view the events of the past weeks as unjust unilateral attacks on Lebanon by Israel.)
  I know what I have experienced of Israel's power.
  I will refer you here to the writings of my old mentor, the Jewish theologian Marc Ellis, Director of Baylor University's Religious Studies Department, concerning Israel and biblical ethics in regards to Israel's mistreatment of Palestinians.
  Then there are the the writings of Noam Chomsky- especially his book, "The Fateful Triangle" which outlined how during America's embargo against the apartheid regime of South Africa, the US re-routed funds through Israel and Israel then flipped them over to the racists in Pretoria. Chomsky happens to be Jewish.
  The fact is that Israel is a state, a legitimate country. So there is no issue here of "recognizing Israel" because Israel exists in every way a nation can.
  However, Ruth, as a Palestinian and Lebanese, I have a right to exist as well. The big problem is that Israel wants recognition normally as a state like other nations, but then they do things that other countries could never get away with.
  As a result of the massacres I told you about- Sabra and Shatilla- Ariel Sharon was indicted by an international tribunal in Belgium about ten years ago.
  The indictment was shrugged off as another evidence of European anti-semitism, and eventually, Sharon rose to poer as Israel's Prime Minister. (How would you feel if you were a Palestinian and the person who had been condemned, by an international tribunal, as the architect of massacres against your people became Prime Minister?)

  There is philosophy of opression that says that ultimately any occupation, any injustice, will be more detrimental to the oppressor than the ones who were oppressed. What is incredible, though, is that as my people- old grandmothers, children, innocent men, continue to bear things like invasion and occupation and strafe bombing by the state of Israel, the propoganda machine turns it around where it's not just that our suffering at Israeli hands is ignored.The facts and truths are twisted around where we are blamed for our own suffering.

  By now the media has reported on every detail of the Israelis soldiers who were captured in their war with Hizbollah. But who knows about the at least six hundred Lebanese citizens who have been killed by Israel. The message here is that our life is cheap compared to Israeli life.

  I will finish with this: for the last twenty years, the great Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, winner of amongst other things a Lannan Award, has been refused entry into the United States. Darwish is a poet. He has never taken up an arm in his life. But Israel has told the US that Darwish should never be allowed into the country because they are afraid that his eloquence will open up American eyes to the truth of what Israel has done. What does it say of a government, a society, when it attempts to silence a poet??????????????????????????????

  As a gift, here is a poem by Darwish.

  The Prison Cell
  by Mahmoud Darwish, trans. by Ben Bennani

  It is possible
  It is possible at least sometimes…
  It is possible especially now
  To ride a horse
  Inside a prison cell
  And run away……

  It is possible for prison walls,
  To disappear,
  For the cell to become a distant land
  Without frontiers:

  -What did you do with the walls?
  -I gave them back to the rocks.
  -And what did you do with the ceiling?
  -I turned it into a saddle.
  -And your chain?
  -I turned it into a pencil.

  The prison guard got angry.
  He put an end to the dialogue.
  He said he didn’t care for poetry,
  And bolted the door of my cell.

  He came back to see me
  In the morning;
  He shouted at me:

  -Where did all this water come from?
  -I brought it from the Nile.
  -And the trees?
  -From the orchards of Damascus.
  -And the music?
  -From my heartbeat.

  The prison guard got mad:
  He put an end to my dialogue.
  He said he didn’t like my poetry,
  And bolted the door to my cell.

  But he returned in the evening:

  -Where did this moon come from?
  -From the nights of Baghdad.
  -And the wine?
  -From the vineyards of Algiers.
  -And this freedom?
  -From the chain you tied me with last night.

  The prison guard grew so sad….
  He begged me to give him back

Withdrawing the pre-war borders is not going to solve all the problems of
dealing w/ people who want to see Israel destroyed. You cd say that war has
not helped the Middle East; you could also say that Israel wd have been
destroyed by now had it not fought at certain moments of its history.

Thanks for your bold, wise and frank reaction to Ruth Lepson's e-mail.
Lepson's scream "save Israel", quite frankly, didn't seem to reach
anywhere.

I tend to stay away from poets who believe in religion.
I think poets have (or should have) one religion and that's poetry.

I didn't know Mahmoud Dwarish was not allowed into the US. It is a shame
for all of us here, perhaps a bigger shame on poetry itself. If anyone has
seen the brief Dwarish interview from Jean Luc Godard's latest film "Notre
Musique", have probably realized the depth, realm and stature of a poet like
Dwarish. Amidst bandwagons full of poets crying for freedom, Dwarish is a
rarity, he is the Nazim Hikmet of our times.

Interestingly, Nazim Hikmet was also denied entry into the US umpteen times.
A year before his death in 1960, he told friend Jean Paul Sartre and Pablo
Neruda in Paris that he never understood why he was turned down by the
US government so many times.

Behalf Of Paul Catafago
Sent: Friday, July 28, 2006 6:17 PM
To: POETICS@LISTSERV.BUFFALO.EDU
Subject: For Ruth Lepson and anyone who cares: A Palestinian/Lebanese poet
responds

My name is Paul Catafago. I am a poet and director of the New York based
arts non-profit Movement One: Creative Coalition (www.movementone.org).  For
the past several days, I have read your posts and decided to respond.
  I am Palestinian (My father was born in Jaffa in 1911) and Lebanese
(Beiruti from my mother's side) so I will tell you that your posts have been
hurtful.
  I have very close relatives who live in Lebanon- including my 84 year old
uncle who was displaced by Israel's agression. My uncle is not a member of
Hizbollah (the propoganda machine has tried to convince people that all
Lebanese who have suffered from Israel's agression are members of
Hizbollah). He is in fact a Catholic monk who naturally doesn't like Israel
much.
  I am not anti-semitic. In fact, I am a semite. However, the propoganda
machine as well, of course, as the agressive tactics of the state of Israel,
all fueled by pathetic and irrational fear sicken me.

  (ISRAEL IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST WITH NUCLEAR CAPABILITY-
AND WHY IS THAT? WASN'T IRAQ INVADED AND EFFECITIVELY DESTROYED BY AMERICA
BECAUSE THE U.S. FEARED THEY HAD "WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION" INCLUDING THE
TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE NUKES? SO WHY IS IT OK FOR ISRAEL TO HAVE THEM, AND NO
OTHER STATE CAN?)

  There is a double standard here. No matter what reason you can give, no
matter what explanation or justification, the fact is Israel operates under
and over international norms.
  And the genius of the propoganda machine is that if anyone ever criticizes
Israel, they are deemed "anti-semitic".

  Your fear that Israel will be destroyed as the safe haven for Jews has
made you turn a blind eye on both reality and history. The fact is Israel
has the world's fourth largest military and "enjoys" blind support of the
US. The fact is, as well, throughout the years, Israel has overseen some of
the most horrific acts of injustice in modern times.

  Have you heard of Sabra and Shatilla? These are two Palestinian refugee
camps in Beirut. In 1982, shortly after Israel had invaded Lebanon under the
command of Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, the Israelis dummied up documents
to show the Lebanese Christian militia, the Phalangists, that the PLO had
assasinated the charismatic Lebanese Christian President, Bashir Gemayel.
The truth was that Gemayel was killed by Amal, a Syrian backed faction. But
by lying to the Phalangists, Israel- specifically Sharon knew it would
incite them to do something drastic against the PLO- essentially doing
Israel's bidding.
  So an attack on these two refugee camps was suggested- and on September
12, 1982, the Phalangists began massacres in both the camps. By the end of
it, thousands of inncoent Palestinians, HUMAN BEINGS, had been killed, under
the watchful eyes of Israeli military leaders, reported to be watching the
massacres from adjacent roofs.

  In the end, all of this doesn't matter, because by this time, after
reading your posts, and witnessing your whimpering about being attacked by
"progressives and leftists.", you still haven't admitted that Israel has
done something wrong.

  I am not a terrorist. I am not anti-semitic. But I have lived in both
Palestine and Lebanon (I heard an Israeli commentator the past few days say
that the Lebanese- especially Christians are secretly admiring Israel for
trying to take out Hizbollah. I will tell you this is a bold faced lie. I am
not commenting on Hizbollah here- but I will say the Lebanese Christians I
know (my family is Christian) view the events of the past weeks as unjust
unilateral attacks on Lebanon by Israel.)
  I know what I have experienced of Israel's power.
  I will refer you here to the writings of my old mentor, the Jewish
theologian Marc Ellis, Director of Baylor University's Religious Studies
Department, concerning Israel and biblical ethics in regards to Israel's
mistreatment of Palestinians.
  Then there are the the writings of Noam Chomsky- especially his book, "The
Fateful Triangle" which outlined how during America's embargo against the
apartheid regime of South Africa, the US re-routed funds through Israel and
Israel then flipped them over to the racists in Pretoria. Chomsky happens to
be Jewish.
  The fact is that Israel is a state, a legitimate country. So there is no
issue here of "recognizing Israel" because Israel exists in every way a
nation can.
  However, Ruth, as a Palestinian and Lebanese, I have a right to exist as
well. The big problem is that Israel wants recognition normally as a state
like other nations, but then they do things that other countries could never
get away with.
  As a result of the massacres I told you about- Sabra and Shatilla- Ariel
Sharon was indicted by an international tribunal in Belgium about ten years
ago.
  The indictment was shrugged off as another evidence of European
anti-semitism, and eventually, Sharon rose to poer as Israel's Prime
Minister. (How would you feel if you were a Palestinian and the person who
had been condemned, by an international tribunal, as the architect of
massacres against your people became Prime Minister?)

  There is philosophy of opression that says that ultimately any occupation,
any injustice, will be more detrimental to the oppressor than the ones who
were oppressed. What is incredible, though, is that as my people- old
grandmothers, children, innocent men, continue to bear things like invasion
and occupation and strafe bombing by the state of Israel, the propoganda
machine turns it around where it's not just that our suffering at Israeli
hands is ignored.The facts and truths are twisted around where we are blamed
for our own suffering.

  By now the media has reported on every detail of the Israelis soldiers who
were captured in their war with Hizbollah. But who knows about the at least
six hundred Lebanese citizens who have been killed by Israel. The message
here is that our life is cheap compared to Israeli life.

  I will finish with this: for the last twenty years, the great Palestinian
poet Mahmoud Darwish, winner of amongst other things a Lannan Award, has
been refused entry into the United States. Darwish is a poet. He has never
taken up an arm in his life. But Israel has told the US that Darwish should
never be allowed into the country because they are afraid that his eloquence
will open up American eyes to the truth of what Israel has done. What does
it say of a government, a society, when it attempts to silence a
poet??????????????????????????????

  As a gift, here is a poem by Darwish.

  The Prison Cell
  by Mahmoud Darwish, trans. by Ben Bennani

  It is possible
  It is possible at least sometimes.
  It is possible especially now
  To ride a horse
  Inside a prison cell
  And run away..

  It is possible for prison walls,
  To disappear,
  For the cell to become a distant land
  Without frontiers:

  -What did you do with the walls?
  -I gave them back to the rocks.
  -And what did you do with the ceiling?
  -I turned it into a saddle.
  -And your chain?
  -I turned it into a pencil.

  The prison guard got angry.
  He put an end to the dialogue.
  He said he didn't care for poetry,
  And bolted the door of my cell.

  He came back to see me
  In the morning;
  He shouted at me:

  -Where did all this water come from?
  -I brought it from the Nile.
  -And the trees?
  -From the orchards of Damascus.
  -And the music?
  -From my heartbeat.

  The prison guard got mad:
  He put an end to my dialogue.
  He said he didn't like my poetry,
  And bolted the door to my cell.

  But he returned in the evening:

  -Where did this moon come from?
  -From the nights of Baghdad.
  -And the wine?
  -From the vineyards of Algiers.
  -And this freedom?
  -From the chain you tied me with last night.

  The prison guard grew so sad..
  He begged me to give him back
  His freedom.

Subject:      The Horror
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

About a week ago, Alan Dershowitz published an execrable editorial in which he
suggested that there should be degrees of "civilianality."  In essence, his
argument held that should you have the bad fortune to live in an area in which
terrorists were being harbored, you were by that very fact less innocent than
other "civilians" and presumably more eligible for being shot.

This is just how far Professor Dershowitz, who has also argued in favor of
"torture warrants," has wandered from civilization in this "war of
civilizations."

How goes it in the real world tonight?

One minute, I'm seeing video tape of the civilian victims of an Israeli attack
on a Red Cross convoy.  The civilian medics, drivers aides and patients
(already shot) had been in contact with the IDF before setting out, had agreed
upon a route, had been assured they would not be fired upon. They started out
on the agreed upon route.  The Israeli forces mortared them.

A test case of degrees of "civilianality"?

Then, a breaking story.  Some nut has just shot several people at a Jewish
community center in Seattle.  As of this writing, one of the victims is dead.

The guy who did this probably had an idea similar to Dershowitz's, probably
thinks that civilians are somehow complicit in things with which they have
nothing to do.

Whatever our other disagreements, I hope we can all join in the struggle against
this kind of thinking.

It's one thing to say that all of us are in some ways responsible for our
government's actions.  Or the actions of governments supported by our
government.  But once you start thinking of ordinary citizens as complicit in
the horrors wrought by their states, you're well on your way to Bin Laden's
cave.

Of course I have heard about Sabra & Shatilla and do not think most Lebanese
are members of Hizbollah. Of course I don't think civilians are implicated
in what some members of the community have done to others. And if I have
been hurtful I am very sorry. Perhaps I shd not have written during a time
when Lebanon is going through such agony & terrible suffering.

James Carroll recently had an editorial in the Boston Globe saying that when
he went to some dinners w/ friends they got angry if he sd anything
pro-Israel,  & when he went to dinner w/ other friends they got angry if he
sd anything pro-Lebanese. He was looking for something in between, Perhaps
that doesn't seem possible to you now. But it seemed to me that w/ the
exception of 2-3 people the posts lately were all anti-Israel & I felt the
need to say something. Most Israelis want peace.

Every day now I speak to my Israelis cousins, who are in the small minority
against the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and I hear abt the rockets hitting
Haifa, where one of them lives, & both cousins say they are tired of war &
they know Israel has done much that is wrong. Yet they despair of any
solutions. They are involved in Peace Now. Yet the son of one is for the
invasion bec he is worried that since Iran & Syria back Hizbollah the
rockets will continue. Every day in Israel for many years there have been an
average of 40 violent actions.

Well, as I write all this I imagine some might be thinking it sounds like a
lot of liberal crap and sentimental justification. I cd also tell you abt
the history of my family but you might say the past treatment and present
treatment in Europe, too, of Jews, is beside the point.

I still think most of the world gets away w/ a lot more than Israel--look at
how many countries of the world treat their own citizens--Iran, Sudan,
Russia, etc.

Prob I will get a lot of angry mail now. But of course each Lebanese citizen
is a human being and I am sorry your country is going through such hell. As
for Palestine, the same.

Ruth

And a sweet paradox line from a Maurice Scully poem, circa 70's,

"zen like stillness is all the go".

Makes me laugh.

Randolph Healy

PS Also in the 70's, at a party a guy was saying "what is the sound of one
hand clapping" no question mark as everyone was supposed to be stunned into
silence. When I made a clapping sound with one hand he got _really_ angry.
"that's not it!!!"

Hmm, I usually start with the assumption that
everything and everyone's complicit in everything.

Ruth

You probably should have addressed Paul Catafago, although I hear you fine.

I don't know enough about the crisis in the mid-east. I am not a Lebanese,
not Palestinian, not Israeli, not American, not Christian, Arab, Muslim or
Jew. I don't even write anti-war poetry as most of it is usually bad poetry,
although certain times, like these, demand that we write some bad poetry.

Wars are omnipotent, have always been, and poets and artists are a kind
that would naturally oppose it - that is most obvious. But what disturbs
me now is that every single warfare we see or hear about today, even
civil wars, have religious enmity at the core. Probably because of the
cold war, the world was more stable and we couldn't see the backward
journey (religious wars) we were making deep inside ourselves.

Thus the word "religion" scares me to death. BTW, I was born Hindu,
but have lived "poetry".

Unless you have a religious or a national reason, it is hard to sympathize
with the
more armed, the more aggressive, the more afflicting....

Someone in this egroup wrote at the beginning of the Iraq war that "language
is always the first casualty during wars". The word "enemy", for instance,
seems
to have become permanently null and void. The enemy is now called
"terrorist",
"insurgent" etc.

Altering language that way reinforces the justification for aggression.

Of course this has got more to do with the US public media than Israel.

The old man and the six-toed cats: Hemingway home in dispute

Saturday, July 29, 2006; Posted: 7:18 a.m. EDT (11:18 GMT)

Key West (Florida)

MIAMI, Florida (AP) -- The caretakers of Ernest Hemingway's Key West
home want a federal judge to intervene in their dispute with the U.S.
Department of Agriculture over the six-toed cats that roam the property.

More than 50 descendants of a multi-toed cat the novelist received as
a gift in 1935 wander the grounds of the home, where Hemingway lived
for more than 10 years and wrote "A Farewell to Arms" and "To Have
and Have Not."

The Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum disputes the USDA's claim that
it is an "exhibitor" of cats and needs to have a USDA Animal Welfare
License, according to a complaint filed Monday in U.S. District Court
in Miami.

"What they're comparing the Hemingway house to is a circus or a zoo
because there are cats on the premises," Cara Higgins, the home's
attorney, said Friday. "This is not a traveling circus. These cats
have been on the premises forever."

A message left Friday afternoon at the Washington, D.C., office of
the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service was not
immediately returned.

The agency has repeatedly denied a license for the Hemingway home
under the Animal Welfare Act, which the home contends governs animals
in commerce. The USDA has threatened to charge the home $200 per cat
per day for violating the act, according to the complaint.

"We're asking the judge to let us know whether this act applies to
the cats, and if so why that is if the animals are not in commerce,"
Higgins said. "If it has something to do with the number of cats, how
many do we have to get rid of to be in compliance with the act?"

Agency inspectors who have repeatedly visited the property since
October 2003 have never indicated any concerns about the welfare of
the cats.

But they have said a 6-foot-high, brick-and-mortar fence Hemingway
built around the property in 1937 did not sufficiently contain the 53
cats, which should be caged, according to the complaint.

Caging the cats, some of which are 19 years old or older, would
traumatize them, and the home's designation as a National Historic
Site prohibits extending the height of the fence, the complaint said.

The tourist site complies with city and county ordinances, Higgins
said. "We don't know why the USDA got involved in this," she said.

Paul, et alles:

Isn't it distressing that here in the "western" world, we quibble over =
the question of "Israel's right to exist" and we ignore the root cause =
question: "The West's right to usurp lands and establish an Israel." =20

Remember, there was no Palestine prior to the U.K's having created it as =
a harbor for European Jews following the end of WWI (of course urged on =
by European Zionists).  =20

And there was no Israel prior to the Jews in Palestine having declared =
themselves an independent nation in 1947.  Of course, it was only after =
the U.K. and the U.S. signed the U.N. resolution in 1948 acknowledging =
the sovereign nation of Israel in the region that the real conflict =
began between Jews in Palestine and Muslims (now Palestinians) in the =
region.

Israelis proudly boast of the defeat they inflicted upon the Egyptians =
and the Jordanians in the war of 1948, but here too, Westerners =
(specifically sympathetic Christians) ignore the issue that the heavily =
armed  Israelis (thanks to U.K. and U.S. weaponry and military training) =
defeated a lessor equipped set of enemies.=20

In point of fact, the U.K. and the U.S. defeated Egypt and Jordan in =
that 1948 skirmish. =20

More importantly, the Israelis claim victory in their past 14 wars since =
1948 against what they refer to as Arab aggression and Muslim terrorism. =
 Those victories, however, have always been because the Israelis had =
superior weaponry and training.  And both the U.K. and the U.S. have and =
continue to sell their latest weapons to the Israelis.  In fact, the =
Israeli Air Force may be better equipped than the Air Force of the =
country that sold them their airplanes.

I'm truly dismayed at the mess in the region; however, personally, I =
don't give a damn whether there is or is not a nation called Israel =
located anywhere on the face of the earth.  That said, I also don't give =
a damn about a nation called Palestine...frankly, I like the idea of the =
region returning to the nomadic village structure pre-1917. =20

But...and here's the rub, I have some U.S. born Jewish citizen friends =
who are willing to enlist in the Israeli Army and defend Israel against =
all its enemies, Muslim or otherwise.=20

Add that fact to the stated mission of Hezbollah, and you have a formula =
for war. =20

I am confident that the root cause of the problems can be traced to the =
Balfour Declaration and the Brit's establishment of the Jewish homeland =
in that region.=20

I am equally confident in saying that a Jewish theocracy, by virtue of =
being a theocracy, is no better nor worse than a Muslim theocracy. =20

I am also and finally distressed at the fact that nine (9) U.S. =
presidents since HST in 1948 have vowed to aid King Abdullah I in =
solving the "Palestinian Problem"  and none of those presidents has done =
anything but work as a diligent Christian to lend support to Israel and =
ignore the principal issues.=20

Too, you are accurate, the screaming over nuclear weapons in Iran (or =
WMD's in Iraq) has nothing what so ever to do with those nation's =
inability to deliver those weapons long range to our shores.  Rather, =
they bespeak the issue of bombing (nuclear or otherwise) Israel. =20

What amuses me more than the issue of NO WMD's in Iraq is the point =
missed by the press and the critics that even had S.H. had an A-Bomb, =
his military lacked the delivery mechanism...we could have given S.H. an =
"A" bomb and watched him fumble with the issue of deploying the =
mechanism.  His airforce, on a really good day, would have had =
difficulty dropping one over Haifa.  That air force could not have =
delivered an "A" bomb to Rome, let alone to Paris or London.  And they =
had no ability what so ever of reaching WA D.C.  But that's all a moot =
point.  It's just to point out there's more to WMD's than owning or =
possessing them. =20

I apologize to you and to your suffering relatives who find themselves =
in the center of the Western European & U.S. support of the Israeli =
survival mayhem, and I wish I could offer more than a few trivial words =
of compassion.=20

Unfortunately, so long as there are compassionate Christians who =
continue to dote on the idea that Jesus was a Jew, and therefore there =
should be Jews in their "HOLY LAND" there will be people willing to die =
for their cause. =20

Sorry I can't offer more help than that...keep writing. =20

  Subject: For Ruth Lepson and anyone who cares: A Palestinian/Lebanese =
poet responds


  My name is Paul Catafago. I am a poet and director of the New York =
based arts non-profit Movement One: Creative Coalition =
(www.movementone.org<http://www.movementone.org/>).  For the past =
several days, I have read your posts and decided to respond.=20
    I am Palestinian (My father was born in Jaffa in 1911) and Lebanese =
(Beiruti from my mother's side) so I will tell you that your posts have =
been hurtful.
    I have very close relatives who live in Lebanon- including my 84 =
year old uncle who was displaced by Israel's agression. My uncle is not =
a member of Hizbollah (the propoganda machine has tried to convince =
people that all Lebanese who have suffered from Israel's agression are =
members of Hizbollah). He is in fact a Catholic monk who naturally =
doesn't like Israel much.
    I am not anti-semitic. In fact, I am a semite. However, the =
propoganda machine as well, of course, as the agressive tactics of the =
state of Israel, all fueled by pathetic and irrational fear sicken me.
    =20
    (ISRAEL IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST WITH NUCLEAR =
CAPABILITY- AND WHY IS THAT? WASN'T IRAQ INVADED AND EFFECITIVELY =
DESTROYED BY AMERICA BECAUSE THE U.S. FEARED THEY HAD "WEAPONS OF MASS =
DESTRUCTION" INCLUDING THE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE NUKES? SO WHY IS IT OK FOR =
ISRAEL TO HAVE THEM, AND NO OTHER STATE CAN?)
    =20
    There is a double standard here. No matter what reason you can give, =
no matter what explanation or justification, the fact is Israel operates =
under and over international norms.
    And the genius of the propoganda machine is that if anyone ever =
criticizes Israel, they are deemed "anti-semitic".
    =20
    Your fear that Israel will be destroyed as the safe haven for Jews =
has made you turn a blind eye on both reality and history. The fact is =
Israel has the world's fourth largest military and "enjoys" blind =
support of the US. The fact is, as well, throughout the years, Israel =
has overseen some of the most horrific acts of injustice in modern =
times.
    =20
    Have you heard of Sabra and Shatilla? These are two Palestinian =
refugee camps in Beirut. In 1982, shortly after Israel had invaded =
Lebanon under the command of Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, the Israelis =
dummied up documents to show the Lebanese Christian militia, the =
Phalangists, that the PLO had assasinated the charismatic Lebanese =
Christian President, Bashir Gemayel. The truth was that Gemayel was =
killed by Amal, a Syrian backed faction. But by lying to the =
Phalangists, Israel- specifically Sharon knew it would incite them to do =
something drastic against the PLO- essentially doing Israel's bidding.
    So an attack on these two refugee camps was suggested- and on =
September 12, 1982, the Phalangists began massacres in both the camps. =
By the end of it, thousands of inncoent Palestinians, HUMAN BEINGS, had =
been killed, under the watchful eyes of Israeli military leaders, =
reported to be watching the massacres from adjacent roofs.
    =20
    In the end, all of this doesn't matter, because by this time, after =
reading your posts, and witnessing your whimpering about being attacked =
by "progressives and leftists.", you still haven't admitted that Israel =
has done something wrong.=20
    =20
    I am not a terrorist. I am not anti-semitic. But I have lived in =
both Palestine and Lebanon (I heard an Israeli commentator the past few =
days say that the Lebanese- especially Christians are secretly admiring =
Israel for trying to take out Hizbollah. I will tell you this is a bold =
faced lie. I am not commenting on Hizbollah here- but I will say the =
Lebanese Christians I know (my family is Christian) view the events of =
the past weeks as unjust unilateral attacks on Lebanon by Israel.)=20
    I know what I have experienced of Israel's power.
    I will refer you here to the writings of my old mentor, the Jewish =
theologian Marc Ellis, Director of Baylor University's Religious Studies =
Department, concerning Israel and biblical ethics in regards to Israel's =
mistreatment of Palestinians.
    Then there are the the writings of Noam Chomsky- especially his =
book, "The Fateful Triangle" which outlined how during America's embargo =
against the apartheid regime of South Africa, the US re-routed funds =
through Israel and Israel then flipped them over to the racists in =
Pretoria. Chomsky happens to be Jewish.
    The fact is that Israel is a state, a legitimate country. So there =
is no issue here of "recognizing Israel" because Israel exists in every =
way a nation can.
    However, Ruth, as a Palestinian and Lebanese, I have a right to =
exist as well. The big problem is that Israel wants recognition normally =
as a state like other nations, but then they do things that other =
countries could never get away with.
    As a result of the massacres I told you about- Sabra and Shatilla- =
Ariel Sharon was indicted by an international tribunal in Belgium about =
ten years ago.
    The indictment was shrugged off as another evidence of European =
anti-semitism, and eventually, Sharon rose to poer as Israel's Prime =
Minister. (How would you feel if you were a Palestinian and the person =
who had been condemned, by an international tribunal, as the architect =
of massacres against your people became Prime Minister?)

    There is philosophy of opression that says that ultimately any =
occupation, any injustice, will be more detrimental to the oppressor =
than the ones who were oppressed. What is incredible, though, is that as =
my people- old grandmothers, children, innocent men, continue to bear =
things like invasion and occupation and strafe bombing by the state of =
Israel, the propoganda machine turns it around where it's not just that =
our suffering at Israeli hands is ignored.The facts and truths are =
twisted around where we are blamed for our own suffering.
    =20
    By now the media has reported on every detail of the Israelis =
soldiers who were captured in their war with Hizbollah. But who knows =
about the at least six hundred Lebanese citizens who have been killed by =
Israel. The message here is that our life is cheap compared to Israeli =
life.
    =20
    I will finish with this: for the last twenty years, the great =
Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, winner of amongst other things a =
Lannan Award, has been refused entry into the United States. Darwish is =
a poet. He has never taken up an arm in his life. But Israel has told =
the US that Darwish should never be allowed into the country because =
they are afraid that his eloquence will open up American eyes to the =
truth of what Israel has done. What does it say of a government, a =
society, when it attempts to silence a =
poet??????????????????????????????
    =20
    As a gift, here is a poem by Darwish.=20
    =20
    The Prison Cell
    by Mahmoud Darwish, trans. by Ben Bennani
    =20
    It is possible
    It is possible at least sometimes.
    It is possible especially now
    To ride a horse
    Inside a prison cell
    And run away..
    =20
    It is possible for prison walls,
    To disappear,
    For the cell to become a distant land
    Without frontiers:
    =20
    -What did you do with the walls?
    -I gave them back to the rocks.
    -And what did you do with the ceiling?
    -I turned it into a saddle.
    -And your chain?
    -I turned it into a pencil.
    =20
    The prison guard got angry.
    He put an end to the dialogue.
    He said he didn't care for poetry,
    And bolted the door of my cell.
    =20
    He came back to see me=20
    In the morning;
    He shouted at me:
    =20
    -Where did all this water come from?
    -I brought it from the Nile.
    -And the trees?
    -From the orchards of Damascus.
    -And the music?
    -From my heartbeat.
    =20
    The prison guard got mad:
    He put an end to my dialogue.
    He said he didn't like my poetry,
    And bolted the door to my cell.
    =20
    But he returned in the evening:
    =20
    -Where did this moon come from?
    -From the nights of Baghdad.
    -And the wine?
    -From the vineyards of Algiers.
    -And this freedom?
    -From the chain you tied me with last night.
    =20
    The prison guard grew so sad..
    He begged me to give him back =20
    His freedom.

This is too diffuse to lend itself to critique (or to be worth the
trouble). Just a historical note: Palestine became a political entity
under the Romans and remained one until the Ottomans, who divided
their turf differently. Even then the word continued to be the
popular designation for the area, on the ground and in Europe.

Being Jewish is not necessary. If you are, there is a box where you can
indicate that you are Jewish.

Thanks, Maria. Happy to sign this one.

Parenthetically, as Aldon has pointed out, images of the civilian tragedies
of this war ('there are no innocent bystanders' clearly), this url:
http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/07/29/060729110246.0h0g1zoy.html
gives a horrifying description of ecological damage from the Israeli bombing
of a power station in Jiyeh two weeks ago, which has now leaked 15 to 30K
tons of oil into the Mediterranean. The biggest oil disaster ever on that
sea.

Condoleezza Rice's 'birth pangs of democracy' and G Bush's "moment of
opportunity for the Mid East' bring language bashing up to a new level, or
one familiar in use by certain Germans in the 1930's.

What's curious to me - re Cable Fox Network, CNN and MNBC is the way
normally conservative anchors positioned in Lebanon, say Tucker Carlson,
and, for awhile, Anderson Cooper, get upset by the extent of the human and
structural damage caused by the onslaught of the Israeli bombardment. (Our
tax dollars midwifing the birth of the democratic mid east!).  Then, these
anchors are transferred out of Lebanon to narrate the war from within Israel
- where folks in the north are obviously suffering - emotionally and
physically - from the Hezbollah rocket attacks. But the physical damage is
certainly minimal in comparison to that of what is being dealt by Israel's
American made F-15s, drones and so forth in the bombing destruction of
Lebanon.    That 'good' moment of having the war narrated from both sides, I
suspect, is put in jeopardy by value systems of the corporate bosses
(Murdoch et al) who manage the anchors.

It's way all way heart breaking, grievous.

The fact that you responded to Aryanil Mukherjee- who responded to my original post says so much about you.
  I am Palestinian.
  I am Lebanese.
  All you care about is your fears, your pain.
  I have enough of this.
  You are insincere, and everyone should know it.

Of course I have heard about Sabra & Shatilla and do not think most Lebanese
are members of Hizbollah. Of course I don't think civilians are implicated
in what some members of the community have done to others. And if I have
been hurtful I am very sorry. Perhaps I shd not have written during a time
when Lebanon is going through such agony & terrible suffering.

James Carroll recently had an editorial in the Boston Globe saying that when
he went to some dinners w/ friends they got angry if he sd anything
pro-Israel, & when he went to dinner w/ other friends they got angry if he
sd anything pro-Lebanese. He was looking for something in between, Perhaps
that doesn't seem possible to you now. But it seemed to me that w/ the
exception of 2-3 people the posts lately were all anti-Israel & I felt the
need to say something. Most Israelis want peace.

Every day now I speak to my Israelis cousins, who are in the small minority
against the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and I hear abt the rockets hitting
Haifa, where one of them lives, & both cousins say they are tired of war &
they know Israel has done much that is wrong. Yet they despair of any
solutions. They are involved in Peace Now. Yet the son of one is for the
invasion bec he is worried that since Iran & Syria back Hizbollah the
rockets will continue. Every day in Israel for many years there have been an
average of 40 violent actions.

Well, as I write all this I imagine some might be thinking it sounds like a
lot of liberal crap and sentimental justification. I cd also tell you abt
the history of my family but you might say the past treatment and present
treatment in Europe, too, of Jews, is beside the point.

I still think most of the world gets away w/ a lot more than Israel--look at
how many countries of the world treat their own citizens--Iran, Sudan,
Russia, etc.

Prob I will get a lot of angry mail now. But of course each Lebanese citizen
is a human being and I am sorry your country is going through such hell. As
for Palestine, the same.

Sadly enough, the Onion is probably more "real" than my hometown paper.

Subject:      civilians
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Hey Al:

Sometimes I'm tempted to say "It's always worse than
everybody thinks."

Dershowitz' attempt to justify the killing of
civilians is shocking at least partly because no
American has tried to justify it in quite this way
before, at least that I'm aware of--perhaps there are
equivalents earlier. I.e. talk about "collateral
damage"?

But the conscious killing of civlians as an essential
element of military strategy has been more or less a
standard practice of war for some centuries at least.
I'm no expert, but is Sherman's march across Georgia
the first U.S. instance of war by massive destruction
of civilian life? And surely the practice goes back
much further in other contexts, although perhaps less
totally? "Less totality"? Nah, I doubt it. Was Mark
Weiss saying something about the Romans regarding
this?

What's fascinating about the obscentify of Dershowitz
on some level is his attempt to explain. To offer
"philisophical" justifications. Historically, most
nations have realized that it's easier not even to
bother. If, that is, they bothered to consider it
relevant.

I know it's stupid to be optimistic, believe me, but
the attempt strikes me at least partly as a desperate
attempt to defend what too many people already see as
indefensible.

But too many Americans? Hell if I know.

Mark





The guy who did this probably had an idea similar to
Dershowitz's,
probably
thinks that civilians are somehow complicit in things
with which they
have
nothing to do.

Whatever our other disagreements, I hope we can all
join in the
struggle against
this kind of thinking.

In my response to George Bowering "offline", I accidentally misspelled
humorous. And to think, in sixth grade, while I was not privy to
information on the koan (but asked in Sunday school why buddhists would
go to hell when they'd heard neither hide nor hair of JESUS CHRIST), I
did win many a spelling bee.

Oh for the love of language.

My heartfelt thanks to those of you who offer ways to negotiate
bleakness, sometimes terrible and difficult, through poetic
sensibilities and kindness--including Gabriel Gudding/your original post
from Fleischman.

Tonight when I grow up, I want to be Wu Ch'Eng-En's monkey king...

("zen like stillness is all the go")

Regards, Deborah Poe

<>

The Monkey King was returned to the Crystal Palace by the heavenly
troops and tied to a post.The Jade Emperor ordered Wu-k'ung cut into
pieces.But neither sword nor spear could hurt even a hair on Wu-k'ung's
body.

The gods were at a loss at what to do.Lao-chun had a suggestion, "Since
he has eaten the fruit and elixir of immortality and has drunken the
magic wine, he cannot be easily killed.We had better put him into the
furnace and when his body is burned, the elixirs he has eaten will be
left at the bottoms.

Lao-chun dragged Wu-k'ung to the Tou Shuai Palace.He pushed Wu-k'ung
into the furnace and order the furnace keepers to fan the flames with
great force.

Wu-k'ung was kept in the furnace for forty-nine days.Lao-chun was just
about to open the furnace when the Monkey King leaped out.He had
survived by standing in the draft of the fans.The flames never caught
him, but the smoke had turned his eyes red.

The furnace keepers tried desperately to hold back Wu-k'ung, but he
knocked them down.Then Wu-k'ung struck down lao-chun.

The Monkey King took the enchanted staff from his ear and stretched it
wide.Then he made such a great disturbance in heaven that neither the
gods nor the four great heavenly kings dared to fight with him again.

Wu-k'ung could not be stopped.Cheng Chun the on-duty god, nervously
dispatched thirty-six generals to besiege him.The Jade Emperor hurriedly
sent for Buddha

Buddha left the Lei Yin Temple and went to the Heavenly Palace
accompanied by two gods.Buddha used his great powers to stop Wu-k'ung's
attack.The Monkey King angrily cried, "Who dares to stop me?"

Try the Indian wars of the 17th century. Both sides killed women and
children, the English rather more effectively.

To Paul & other writing about Israel & Lebanon,

It was a mistake, addressing my message to Aryanil--I received his email &
yours together & I wrote down the wrong name tho my email was clearly
intended to be addressed to you.

Also, I shd not have compared the situation to others in the world, at this
moment.

And I am sorry for the loss of innocent life today and always.

As my email was hurtful to you yours was to me.

Yesterday in the Boston Globe Cornel West wrote in an editorial: 'Is it
possible for Jews to reject the ugly Israeli subjugation of Palestinians,
the plight of their prisoners in Israeli jails (especially the women and
children), or the anti-Arab bigotry in Israeli society without being
demonized a self-hating Jew? Is it possible for Arabs to reject the
pernicious rhetoric of pushing Israel into the sea, the barbaric practice of
suicide bombers and anti-Jewish bigotry in Arab communities without being
demeaned?'

When I say most Israelis want peace I mean long-term. Sometimes it seems as
if the situation is insoluble or may take decades to come to.

Let's hope not.

Ruth

Hi List People,

since this is a list for writers, I thought I'd mention a program set
up by the Canadian Coalition Against the Death Penalty--
http://ccadp.org/ --  if you go to their website you can get
information about prisoners on death row who are looking for pen pals.
 A lot of the prisoners are interested in poetry and literature, but
maybe more importantly they just need someone to correspond with.

Best,
Lisa Jarnot

**Doping Scandal Rocks Poetry**

by Mike Freakman

July 30, New York (AHP2 News Service) =96  The=20
poetry world has been rocked by recent=20
revelations that several of the most prestigious=20
national poetry contest winners in 2005 and 2006=20
were written with the aid of performance-enhancing drugs.

=93Over the past decade, poetry contests have=20
emphasized our openness to all participants, with=20
the promise that each manuscript is judged on its=20
merits along,=94 said Guadalupe Maximino Glumstein,=20
the Chancellor of the International Poetry=20
Contests Federation (IPCF). =93Doping is a huge=20
step backward in our efforts, since it gives an=20
unfair competitive advantage to those who are=20
willing to do anything, including risk long-term=20
damage to their bodies and minds, in order to write the best poem.=94

The IPCF advocates testing for=20
performance-enhancing drugs as a prerequisite for=20
national book publications, slam competitions, as=20
well a poetry contests. Poets that violate IPCF=20
rules would be ineligible for prizes or=20
anthologies for penalty periods of one year for=20
first offenders to eternity for repeat offenders.=20
Poets that comply with IPCF guidelines get a=20
sticker to affix to all their publications=20
certifying their poems as doping-free.

=93Unless we want poetry to sink back into the=20
margins of society, we must assure readers that=20
poets produce their work with their own sweat=20
and  imagination. When we teach a poem to a young=20
person in a school setting, to inspire and=20
instruct, we need to be able to say that anyone=20
can aspire to write a poem as good as this. We=20
can=92t afford to send a message that doping is=20
necessary to write the best poems. We have to have an even playing field.=94

Several leading poets were asked to comment on=20
the scandal but refused to talk on the record,=20
for fear of provoking IPCF investigations of=20
their conduct. Unlike the use of doping in track=20
and cycling, poets often use=20
poetry-performance-enhancing drugs to cause=20
temporary physical and mental impairment or=20
paralysis, in order to hyperactivate their=20
imaginative capacities. The practice has been=20
shown to cause a number of long-term physical and mental maladies.

But 11-year old Daisy Threadwhistle of=20
Incontrobrogliaria, New Jersey, was eager to=20
speak on the record. Ms. Threadwhistle said she=20
was very disappointed when a poem from her school=20
reader was removed when its author tested=20
positive for performance-enhancing drugs. =93 =91The=20
Moon Is My  Revenge, Venus My Soldier of=20
Midnight=92 =94 was my favorite poem this year. I=20
feel cheated. I don=92t think I want to read any more poems.=94
In early 2006, IPCF introduced a battery of blood=20
and psychological tests to detect poetic doping.=20
An IPCF study group is now investigating whether=20
the use of certain computer programs and search=20
engines also should be banned from poetry.

I remember teaching a poetry workshop at the San Francisco Art Institute
circa 1972 when a student quit in disgust with the argument/protest that
reading and/or writing poetry was only half of what you could get on a good
combination of drugs, in fact, the use of words diminished the whole
experience. Furthermore if I could not get what I needed 'in color', I was =
-
in any case - missing the whole point of art.

I and that kid (if he is still alive) are probably in the same or related
meditation group now! At least for me - and no doubt Gabriel G. -  turning
off the chatter-box, silence before the revelations, if they be, of making
poetry is good for my processes.

Which is not to negate other means - concentrated reading (As George B
suggests), walking, etc., etc. among them.

Thanks for this Onion-esque bit;

I can't remember if I ever posted the link to my "J.T. Le Roy: A Literary
Steroid Scandal" blog piece earlier this year---
though it's a different style, it plays with the same analogy--
but it'd be fun (or maybe tedious) to pursue the analogy further
because, well, winning a poetry contest (or selling a lot of books
of a memoir) isn't really analogous to, say, hitting 70 homers in a year.
It's probably more like being voted into the all-star game by fans
(and yes one's performance has something to do with that,
but there still ain't much agreed criteria for
what constitutes a "homer" or "bloop single" in poetry--
and that could be okay....it probably has to be...)...

thanks again, Chris

Ruth Lepson,

  I am sickened by your words, sickened by the way you now twist things around to make yourself a victim simply because I was angered that you did not take care enough to see who I was, that I am a human being and I should be responded to accordingly.

  Oh you addressing Aryanil Mukherjee was a simple mistake, I guess like collateral damage.

  If you were sincere, you would have back channeled me, written me a personal email instead of airing this out on the list and again trying to appear as a victim, of course taking another opportunity to defend the state of Israel.

  You twist everything around to serve your dual purpose of 1) defending Israel 2) having people think you are a victim.

  I think in your heart of hearts, you would be really happy if every non-Jew would leave the state of Israel, as well as the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank. Now your liberal sensibilities may not prefer the actual Israeli policies of expulsions, house demolitions, land theft, executions, etc. But if that's what it takes to make Palestinians disappear from Greater Israel, so be it.

  I imagine you got other emails concerning your posts. So now you quote the well-known Cornel West to advance your cause. You deftly realize that West is very big amongst progressives. If you really believed that the occupation should end, that Israel should stop subjugating Palestinians in their apartheid regime, you would have said so before.

  The fact is you are acting as a propogandist, no better than the people at Campus Watch. Your whole agenda was defending Israel. Even in the Cornel West quote, there is a mention of Arabs wanting to push the Jews into the sea.

  PLEASE. As I said, I am a semite and I don't have to prove myself to anyone about being pro or anti anything, I were anti-Semitic, I would be anti-myself. So I find it offensive (and actually hackneyed in terms of propoganda) to keep repeating that Arabs want to push the Jews into the Sea.

  In the end, as I said to someone else, I have suffered some emotional trauma because of the situations in Palestine and Lebanon, and it has been exacerbated dealing with your words. The way you twist it, we should now all feel bad for poor poor Ruth because she received a few angry emails. The trials and tribulations of my family members displaced by your beloved and idyllic state of Israel are less important than the mental anguish suffered by poor poor Ruth.

  I did some research on you: I see you have some sort of reputation as a feminist. In your work advocating for women, does that ever include Palestinian women and how their rights and lives are daily destroyed by Israel?

  There is no equity here: there is no Cornel West quote that fairly chides both Palestinians/Lebanese and Israels/Jews. The fact is that Israel has power and Palestinians and Lebanese have been victims of that power, allowed to run wild by Israel's sponsor, the United States.

  I think in the end you should stop your posts defending Israel at least in this venue because you really are not going to change minds here and I think the whole thing has veered away from Poetics (by the way you did not even respond to my gift of the Darwish poem!!!!).

  So I will end with these words- I will legitimize this post for Poetics and give you one last gift, Ruthie: another poem by Mahmoud Darwish, oft persecuted, imprisoned and exiled by Israel. Enjoy!!!!!
  Paul Catafago

  IDENTITY CARD
  by Mahmoud Darwish, 1964


Write Down!
I am an Arab
And my identity card is fifty thousand
I have eight children
And the ninth is coming after a summer
Will you be angry?

Write Down!
I am an Arab
Employed with fellow workers at a quarry
I have eight children
I get them bread
Garments and books
from the rocks..

I do not supplicate charity at your doors
Nor do I belittle myself at the footsteps of your chamber
So will you be angry?

Wrie Down!
I am an Arab
I have a name without a title
Patient in a country
Where people are enraged

My roots
Were entrenched before the birth of time
And before the opening of the eras
Before the pines, and the olive trees
And before the grass grew

My father.. descends from the family of the plow
Not from a privileged class
And my grandfather..was a farmer
Neither well-bred, nor well-born!
Teaches me the pride of the sun
Before teaching me how to read
And my house is like a watchman's hut
Made of branches and cane

Are you satisfied with my status?
I have a name without a title!

Write Down!
I am an Arab
You have stolen the orchards of my ancestors
And the land which I cultivated
Along with my children
And you left nothing for us
Except for these rocks..
So will the State take them
As it has been said?!

Therefore!
Write Down on the top of the first page:
I do not hate people
Nor do I encroach
But if I become hungry
The usurper's flesh will be my food
Beware..
Beware..
Of my hunger
And my anger!

  To Paul & other writing about Israel & Lebanon,

It was a mistake, addressing my message to Aryanil--I received his email &
yours together & I wrote down the wrong name tho my email was clearly
intended to be addressed to you.

Also, I shd not have compared the situation to others in the world, at this
moment.

And I am sorry for the loss of innocent life today and always.

As my email was hurtful to you yours was to me.

Yesterday in the Boston Globe Cornel West wrote in an editorial: 'Is it
possible for Jews to reject the ugly Israeli subjugation of Palestinians,
the plight of their prisoners in Israeli jails (especially the women and
children), or the anti-Arab bigotry in Israeli society without being
demonized a self-hating Jew? Is it possible for Arabs to reject the
pernicious rhetoric of pushing Israel into the sea, the barbaric practice of
suicide bombers and anti-Jewish bigotry in Arab communities without being
demeaned?'

When I say most Israelis want peace I mean long-term. Sometimes it seems as
if the situation is insoluble or may take decades to come to.

Let's hope not.

Ruth

Drugs have just as much place in the creative arts as anything else does.
I'd venture to say that if there's something that doesn't have a place in
poetry, it is judging and competition...not drugs.  Some of the best
American writers came out of the beat generation and LSD and all other sorts
of things.  Some of it was due in part to actual drug use, but a lot of it
was due to a climate in America created by drugs become more liberal.  Not
to mention the fact that drug use puts you in unnatural and abnormal
situations you might not have ended up coming to on your own.  Look at
Hunter S. Thompson.  Ginsberg.  Jim Morrison (American Prayer, Wilderness,
etc).  If drug poetry bothers you, read other poetry.

I'm not advocating drug use, since you really have to be careful or you may
eventually come to feel you're only creative when you're on drugs (a bad
thing for sure), but writers and poets long have a history of vices and
substance abuse.  If an artist wants to make their art (the only thing that
will last anyway) a priority over their physical body, nobody has a right to
tell them they are wrong, they are immoral, they are cheaters, etc.  We
aren't airline pilots...we're trying to do something new and exciting, and
for many young people, drugs are something new and exciting they can tie
into poetry.  Whether you disagree or not personally with the decision, as
an ARTIST, you should at least be tolerant of the creative methods of
others, even if you can't muster an ounce of respect.  The poetic community
doesn't need obscenely narrow-minded judeo-christian standards slapped all
over it.  There is no one better poet and no one worse poet...we're all just
artists.  "Unfair advantage" is a term you can save for athletes.

I remember teaching a poetry workshop at the San Francisco Art Institute
circa 1972 when a student quit in disgust with the argument/protest that
reading and/or writing poetry was only half of what you could get on a good
combination of drugs, in fact, the use of words diminished the whole
experience. Furthermore if I could not get what I needed 'in color', I was -
in any case - missing the whole point of art.

I and that kid (if he is still alive) are probably in the same or related
meditation group now! At least for me - and no doubt Gabriel G. -  turning
off the chatter-box, silence before the revelations, if they be, of making
poetry is good for my processes.

Which is not to negate other means - concentrated reading (As George B
suggests), walking, etc., etc. among them.

My on-the-spot on tap accounts of SoundEye 2006 are available at British & =
Irish Poets, http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/british-poets.html
July 4, 5, 6, 7 (not truncated version), 8, & 10

SoundEye is a unique festival.  I think the radiant animus of Trevor Joyce =
is the heart & soul of it not least because of the muscular relationships =
he has established with artists and intellectuals outside poetry (if the =
domain 'outside poetry' can be said to exist), in Ireland & internationally=
.  What Fergal Gaynor has brought to the festival, with the Cork Caucus =
last year and the cabarets this year (and a book on the Caucus coming =
soon) is pure gold.  There is such serious fun to be had here -- I don't =
know of an American equivalent: I don't know where SoundEye's embrace of =
its city, intellectual possibilities & responsibilities, and a wide range =
of the arts, is replicated in the United States.  And all this heady & =
hearty excitement circles around the hub of Trevor's home, consummately & =
generously opened to visiting poets.  British film-maker Adam Wyeth made a =
92 min film of SoundEye 2005, bringing his own perspective as a film-maker =
& poet to the festival.  SoundEye is intense & lends itself to blending & =
construction of one's own vivid SoundEye.  I am (as always) joking in my =
reports, but SoundEye is a laboratory for reading and observing/reflecting =
on reading as well as everything else.  Certainly it is a week of deep =
reflection & immersion for me, as well as performance, & fiery conversation=
.  I treasure it.  Thank you Trevor, Matthew, Fergal, & all.

You don't have to have an account to see the revision history.

The "legendary downtown New York poet" Steve Dalachinsky has Jonathan
Penton to thank for the latest revisions.

Also, Ric Caddel's entry has 14 edits, mostly by 193.62.17.28

sorry but i think there is a point it this that is getting swept away for example

  people who worked in the World trade Centre were not innocent - NO BODY WORKING FOR THOSE COMPANIES WAS INNOCENT - YOU HAVE TO FUCK OVER A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GET THERE - TO GET THOSE JOBS  - do they need to died for that - maybe not - but when people make decisions on how and where they live - there are consequences - if you chose to follow a set of beliefs there are consequence to that AND SOMETIMES THAT MEANS PEOPLE WILL WANT TO KILL YOU FOR REALLY DUMB REASONS

  what i find strange is the idea that some of you out there seem to think there is a right and wrong to this - are you really that silly to think that any of this (the war - terrorist-Iraq -  Israel), is a right and wrong issue - maybe you need to get out more and stop reading the media. maybe you need to stop thinking that there is a reason to living other than living. living makes things die on a small and large scale - and lots of times it will not be for a reason that you like or feel is justified.

  big deal

  stop thinking  it's all about you

dershowitz is not alone in advancing this kind of thinking; here's the

"'Civilians' in Lebanon have munitions in their basements and

it. Israel uses precision weapons to avoid hitting them; Hezbollah sends
random missiles into Israel to ensure they are struck."


barbara o'brien offers the following take on this:
"I had to read that paragraph several times. Just what is Hanson saying
here? He seems to be claiming that Lebanese civilians commonly volunteer
to be suicide victims of Israeli attacks. I see that Hanson puts the
word civilians in quotation marks, connoting irony â€” those so-called
civilians are not really (wink, nudge) civilians. Is he claiming that
the claims of civilian deaths are exaggerated? Is he saying that itâ€™s OK
to kill Lebanese civilians because they are asking for it?"


yes that seems to be what he's saying...

Maybe I should have clarified my question. I meant the
first concerted instance of U.S. war policy directed
primarily against civilians who they understood to be
civilians. There's no entity called the U.S. in the
17th century.

I'm not sure whether the Trail of Tears, for instance,
is warfare as such, and I doubt that the term
civilians would have been applied to the Cherokees (my
point here is not to excuse that event).

Local massacres of civilians are of course common in
all sorts of historical situations--but what I'm
looking for is the historical moment(s) in which it
becomes conscious U.S. military policy to attack
civilians FIRST, instead of as a byproduct of already
ongoing battles between armies.

Which raises another historical question, which is at
what moment did the concept of "civilians" come to be
separated from the idea of a nation as such? Civilians
as a transnational concept? Anybody know?

Try the Indian wars of the 17th century. Both sides
killed women and
children, the English rather more effectively.

and surely it began long before that--during king philip's war in the late
1600s the settlers were burning whole villages of women and children right
here in massachusetts.

I understand the point you're trying to make in saying that people who
worked for the companies in the World Trade Center were not "innocent", but
does that really apply to janitors, for example?  Again, I realize that you
may not consider the presence of working  class people there to be relevant
to your point, but I think it's important to avoid making the working class
experience even more invisible than it already is.

Even so "Nobody working there was innocent" is still far too sweeping a gen=
eralization. Unless you want to go so far as to say "no one is innocent," w=
hich, fine, that's a dick thing to say and it renders the term meaningless,=
 but just because they worked for financial services companies it doesn't m=
ean they fucked people over. Never mind that they weren't even all financia=
l services companies:

"NO BODY WORKING FOR THOSE COMPANIES WAS INNOCENT"

Right, inasmuch as nobody is "innocent." We all do what we need to get by,
we all scrape a litte here and look the other way there.

And, to echo Elizabeth, there were plenty of working class folks killed on
9/11. Janitors, security guards, couriers, etc.. (As if being "working
class" makes random incineration less acceptable.)

i am not blaming victims (kids remember i'm not actual an terrorist - just a beef eatting no car driving straight male who is white and lives with a non white person and another other littler person)- I'm pointing that there really are no victims (victims- you Americans are very fond of being victims or help out others by calling them victims)

  wtc is strike at USA and American (and North America and the "WEST") and if you are unwilling to admit that maybe you (we) are occasional due a slap down from our slaves then you can be sure that it will happen again, and again - sometimes the little guy gets in a good sucker punch


  the "working class" (do you people ever listen to yourselves - no class system here) stiffs they were probably not the target

  the target was the really fucking big buildings in the middle of the really fucking big city in the middle of the really fucking annoying country that likes to tell all the other counties what to do and how to do it - frankly anywhere  in that county was  fair game  that day

  your "working class" were as your White House likes to call collateral damage  (as the "working class" usually is anywhere and everywhere (Iraq)

  basically they smashed at your idol in your temple to money and you wonder why ?

  i don't  think you learn very well

U, Jonathan,

That was a piece of satire.
You know, parodic, ironic writing.

Vipassana has nothing to do with one or two or no hands clapping.  That's Zen, a form of Mahayana Buddhism.  Vipassana, which is Theravada Buddhism, watches the breath and sensations in the body.  It could do you good, Steve.  And it's no old Brooklyn joke before or after email.  Regards, Tom Savage

Just a quick emergence from lurkerdom, to say that yes, I believe there is a
right and a wrong when it comes to killing civilians.  Not, I would hasten
to add, an ossified and self-serving "right" & "wrong" that resembles the
position of the Bush administration, for example.  I wouldn't claim it's a
simple black and white issue, but in a historical context such as the one in
the Mideast, a much more faceted one (i.e., both "sides" have obviously
killed their share of civilians-- one of them, to paraphrase, a bit more
effectively).  But do I think there is a right and wrong to this?  Hell yes.
  Don't you?  While there may be no reason for living other than doing so,
that doesn't preclude respecting the  basic rights of others, even those
whom you don't particularly like.  I hope that you wrote this in haste, or
were just having a bad day, or something.  Otherwise, if I understand you
correctly, it strikes me as just a bit "sociopathic" (note scare quotes),
and not all that removed from the positions of those I would presume you
disagree with.

Now, while you all argue, if you don't mind I'm going to go back to lurking.
  And deleting lots of posts unread.

Cheers,

Mark DuCharme

sorry but i think there is a point it this that is getting swept away for
example

   people who worked in the World trade Centre were not innocent - NO BODY
WORKING FOR THOSE COMPANIES WAS INNOCENT - YOU HAVE TO FUCK OVER A LOT OF
PEOPLE TO GET THERE - TO GET THOSE JOBS  - do they need to died for that -
maybe not - but when people make decisions on how and where they live -
there are consequences - if you chose to follow a set of beliefs there are
consequence to that AND SOMETIMES THAT MEANS PEOPLE WILL WANT TO KILL YOU
FOR REALLY DUMB REASONS

   what i find strange is the idea that some of you out there seem to think
there is a right and wrong to this - are you really that silly to think that
any of this (the war - terrorist-Iraq -  Israel), is a right and wrong issue
- maybe you need to get out more and stop reading the media. maybe you need
to stop thinking that there is a reason to living other than living. living
makes things die on a small and large scale - and lots of times it will not
be for a reason that you like or feel is justified.

   big deal

   stop thinking  it's all about you

dershowitz is not alone in advancing this kind of thinking; here's the
national review's victor davis hanson:

"'Civilians' in Lebanon have munitions in their basements and
deliberately wish to draw fire; in Israel they are in bunkers to avoid
it. Israel uses precision weapons to avoid hitting them; Hezbollah sends
random missiles into Israel to ensure they are struck."


barbara o'brien offers the following take on this:
"I had to read that paragraph several times. Just what is Hanson saying
here? He seems to be claiming that Lebanese civilians commonly volunteer
to be suicide victims of Israeli attacks. I see that Hanson puts the
word civilians in quotation marks, connoting irony â€” those so-called
civilians are not really (wink, nudge) civilians. Is he claiming that
the claims of civilian deaths are exaggerated? Is he saying that itâ€™s OK
to kill Lebanese civilians because they are asking for it?"


yes that seems to be what he's saying...

I think it was Richard Wright in  _The Man Who Lived Underground_ who alerted me to the possibility that no matter how little money I make or how much garbage I sort and recycle, that I am not innocent.

so...what on earth are you guys saying?  if none of us are "innocent,"
whatever that means (is this a biblical, garden of edeny kind of thing?),
is that to say, oh ennui, oh nihilism, that we are expendable with a
shrug, that it's okay to kill women and children and men who haven't
anything to do with waging war?  sounds like hume waving his hands with
largesse and saying nothing really exists.  it's okay then to kill _your_
children and _your_ parents, just another expendable non-innocent?  argh.
get out of your heads and go make compost!  gabe
