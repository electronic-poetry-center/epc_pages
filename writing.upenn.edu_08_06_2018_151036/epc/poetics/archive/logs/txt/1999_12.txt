Tale


Two [shinto] priests were walking down a steep hill; they met a [budd-
hist] monk walking up. "Where are you going?" one of the priests asked.
"It is near the end of the world," said the monk, "and I am going to the
top of the hill to observe." "Don't you know," said one of the priests,
"it is the same everywhere?" "But not to the hill," answered the monk.
When I was telling this story, the rabbi [jewish] asked, "But why were
there two priests?" "Because, I answered, one of them might have for-
gotten the script." The rabbi answered, "But the world is the script."
And I replied, "If the world is the script, it is the hill which is
writing and the priests who are reading." The rabbi said, "But it is the
monk who guides the pen." A [protestant] minister, happening by, gave his
ear to the tale. He said, "The hill has given the pen to the tale." I
answered, "But it is christ himself who has given the hill, who has as-
cended the hill as the holy mount, to preach to one and all." The monk
said, "By what authority do you speak? For you seem to be jewish by cul-
ture, if not religion, and hardly catholic, to speak of the christ." I
answered, "It is my belief that christ is within all of us, that we are
all our sons." The monk said, "Thus we repeatedly give birth to ourselves
over and over again, generation upon generation," to which one of the
priests replied, "Yes, but it is the latter that speaks to the former,
since the latter carries the wisdom of the former." The minister said,
"It is upon such that the gospel was written." I answered, "It is upon
such that everything is written, from the beginning to the end of the
word." The rabbi answered, "Thus is the word made world," and the monk
said, "And thus the catholic, the word made flesh. For what is the flesh
of the word?" One of the priests said, "To be cleansed and purified, for
the circumspection of the living." I added, "Thus for the circumspection
of the dead," and the monk replied, "From here throughout our ministra-
tions." The rabbi said, "For who is to be believed, properly speaking,
but the holy script itself?" A nearby jainist answered, "In relation to
the fecundity of the earth, to which we should give as little pain as
possible." The monk replied, "What is universal has no recourse among the
individual." The rabbi agreed, saying, "And who is among the enlight-
ened?" I replied, "Those who know the value of this, not that - and that,
not this." "Exactly," cried the monk. The minister, perplexed, ended the
session by stating that suffering and enlightenment are both in the hands
of god, to whom we give thanks. The priests nodded in assent.

I disagree with your assessment that class obfuscates race. In fact, I think
the opposite is true: in discussions about race and literature, writers
often pretend that if they're "covering" race, that class is somehow just
"included" even when a class analysis is not developed.
I do, however, very much agree with the following:
"But when we ask about a writer's relation to class -- his/her own, or
another's -- *in poetry*, aesthetically, we start asking very interesting
and *neat* questions that for me circle around (who else but) Marx and, in
particular, the idea of alienation."

Yeap, Aldon -- just checked the New Direction text (which I happen to be

hunh?  this is really weird.  Mumia is about to be executed, and you're

2 comments on that lovable nut david antin: 1) anyone notice how every talk
ends up being, or being framed by, a tale of trauma inflicted on a female
relative, which he can and does interpret?  (yours truly addresses this
phenomenon in a piece on antin, "Talking Yiddish at the Boundaries,"
_Cultural Studies_ 5:1) 2) i'd like him to write a sequel, "how it feels to
be avant-garde me," which may be what the other title is a screen for.

I don't think class is necessarily only a screen for not talking about
race, except in the sense that white male Marxists I have seen at academic
conferences bring in class when the conversation shifts to gender and
race, just as white middle class feminists bring in gender when the topic
shifts to class and race, while others bring in race when the topic is
class and gender.  Its a game of one-downsmanship, in which leverage is
exerted by those speaking from the position of least (apparent) privilege.
It's like the game where you talk your hand from below a pile of other
people's hands as fast as you can, and soon your hand is at the bottom
again. I wouldn't question the legitimacy of anyone's concerns. But I
would question the usefulness of this particular game. You can talk about
race without questioning sincerity of someone else's desire to talk about
something else.

 Of course, the next move in the game is to say that Jonathan, having no
stake in this game in the first place, does not understand its urgency and
importance...

Friends:

Does anyone know the whereabouts of Miriam Koshland? I don't know much
about her, except that in the mid-1950s she was trying to get _Poetry_ and

hi all,
i've been unable to keep up w/the list discussions for the past few weeks, so
i just read through about a billion posts, and am happy to see the class
thread and relateds have been going for a while.
i have a few posts i wish to comment on, and hopefully i'll be able to keep
up w/this a little more frequently than i've been able to of late.
so, as i'm going over a lot of time here, i'll try to make this clear...

in my post dated 11/10, i said, "the experience of class is different for
women and men, as women also have to contend with sexism, men do not. (and
then, of course, there are many other isms that can show up too...) multiple
-isms seem to have a geometric rather than simply additive effect."

on 11/12, dodie responded to my post with, "I've been keeping out of this
class discussion, but I think saying that implying that women have it worse
than men on the class-prejudice scale is an unnecessary essentialism--and it
is contrary to my experience.  As much as I bitch and moan about class
prejudice, I've always felt that working class guys had a harder time
assimilating into the middle class poetry world I've known."

i'm not sure exactly how to respond to this, but i do think it's important to
respond to, and it's been on my mind for weeks now, so here's a response,
here's something:
i'm not sure that it's harder, easier, better, worse, or exactly what for
women and men in the poetry world, or any other "world" of our world(s)...i
do believe that it is __different__ for women and men...and i can imagine
sometimes those differences add up to easier/harder/whatever-er, depending on
where one is standing at that moment. sometimes i do think it's "easier"
being a woman in some ways, and then i walk down a street at night and
reconsider. sometimes i think men have it easier, and then i remember that
men are supposed to be these bastions of "strength," non-emotion and all that
socialized crap, so then i think men have a pretty raw deal. (a billion or
more addt'l examples of "easier" "harder" etc. come to mind, but i think i've
made myself clear.)

so, i don't have an answer to whether it's easier or harder for who or what
and why. it's just different, it just is, and gender __is__ an important
element...just as race, sexual orientation, ability/disability,
rural/urban/regional/access issues, etc... all of these elements and more are
involved in experiences of and interpretations of "class." they overlap,
multiply, and, of course divide. it's just not clean-cut. it's not simple
math. and that was what i was trying to say there, dodie, and all.

so i've been reading through the posts, knowing i'd respond to dodie, and
wondering if there was anything else that i'd wish to respond to, tho i'd
rather be a lurker as it takes a lot of effort and time to be involved and i
often don't have a lot of time or extra effort available as i'm doing quite
all i can manage already but that's a sidetrack...so then i saw jonathan
mahew's post of 11/24 listing his ideas of which poets represent what
classes, and this reminds me why gender and race and etc and all the not-tidy
categories have to be brought up again along with the already not-tidy
"class."
(to clarify--this is not an attack, jonathan, just a statement of fact, no
sarcasm oozing from the screen...)

so it's messy, this "class" idea, and all that is wrapped with it.

simon dedeo, i don't think i can agree with your assertion from your post of
11/30 that "The question of class in poetry ... is, more often that not, a
question designed to avoid the much more problematic issue of race."
--i think __all__ of these issues (race, class, gender, sexual orientation,
ability/disability, rural/urban/regional/access issues, etc.) (and there are
more) are problematic, and i think we each have our own particular areas we
find the most difficult to deal with. or ignore. or whatever it is we choose
to do. or not do. with these difficulties.

and now i have to "work"--tho i earn no money for what i have to go do, so is
it "work"? (yes it is.)

thanks for reading,
jill stengel

ps--almost forgot: david baratier wrote, 11/15, "Jill, if you check back
through my posts, I did not state that lack of access to opportunities does
not occur, I made pains to maintain my writing in "I" based statements, when
mass assumptions were made & I knew they did not fit me, I went outside of
these confines to include some other individual writers. Never was there a
"we" intended. I did not address women & class, which is not an oversight, I
do not have personal experience and assume others here would address the
subject."
thanks for clarifying, david, i appreciate it. yes you did make "i"
statements, and, as i didn't see you acknowledging other possibilities of
experience, i assumed you weren't allowing for this. now i see you were just
trying to be clear, and to speak from your own perspective. thank you for
telling me your intentions. in an oral conversation this would have been
quick to clear up, in this kind of a conversation it's harder, takes longer.

Don't forget your Soc 101. You have to consider four things:

Assets
Income
Power
Prestige

What about culture? Are you talking Culture (would you rather go to the
philharmonic or the hockey game?) or culture (world-view, beliefs,
behavioral preferences, etc.)
Culture is part of prestige and culture is a byproduct of the combinatoin
of assets, income, power, and prestige. Your position in
society is a product of your upbringing and education, which in
turn depends on your, and, earlier, your parents' assets, income, power,
and prestige.

Who pays for poetry? Whose poetry? Some bourgeois people dish out $25 for
Seamus Heaney while our chapbooks languish in the store.

JENA OSMAN's book, THE CHARACTER, published by Beacon (1999), is the
winner of the 1998 Barnard New Woman Poets Prize. "Her writing is the way
the mind works," wrote Leslie Scalapino of this book. Jena's publications
include JURY (Meow Press, 1996), Amblyopia (Avenue B, 1993) and poems
appearing in Abacus, Avec, Big Allis, Conjunctions, O-blek, Subliminal
Time and elsewhere. With Juliana Spahr, Jena is the editor of the
influential magazine Chain. She has read at the Writers House for
PhillyTalks and on "Live at the Writers House." She is assistant professor
of English at Temple University.

BOB PERELMAN recently published THE FUTURE OF MEMORY, a new book of verse,
and his selected poems, TEN TO ONE. For many years Bob lived in San
Francisco where he edited Hills magazine and was central to the
development of the language poetry movement.  From 1977 to 1981 he
coordinated the San Francisco Talks Series and edited Writing/Talks (1985)
gathered from the series. His books of poetry include Braille (Ithaca
House, 1975), Face Value (Roof Books, 1988), and Virtual Reality (Roof
Books, 1993). He is also the author of two books of theory and criticism,
The Trouble with Genius (University of California, 1994), and The
Marginalization of Poetry (Princeton, 1996). Now of course he lives in
Philadelphia, where he is an Associate Professor of English at Penn. Bob
is a member of the Writers House "hub" or planning committee.

BRIAN KIM STEFANS is the author of Free Space Comix (Roof, 1998) and the
forthcoming Angry Penguins (Object). His collaboration with Sianne Ngai,
"The Cosmopolitans," was featured as the second issue of the zine
Interlope published out of Iowa City. His works have also appeared in many
magazines, including the web journals Ubu and Yellow Jacket, under a
pseudonym. Brian published three issues of the journal Arras before taking
it to the web in 1998. His critical writings have been published in Korean
Culture and The Poetry Project Newsletter, and a long essay on alternative
Asian American poetry now appears in Talisman. Brian participated in a
PhillyTalks program at the Writers House last year.

Among RON SILLIMAN's many important writings are Ketjak (This, 1978);
Tjanting (The Figures, 1981); "The New Sentence" (Roof, New York, NY,
1987); the anthology "In the American Tree" (1986); Leningrad, a
collaboration with Michael Davidson, Lyn Hejinian, and Barrett Watten
(1991); Demo to Ink (Chax, 1992); Toner (Potes & Poets, 1992); N/O (Roof,
1994) and recently "(R)" (Drogue). The earliest published poems Ron
doesn't mind listing appeared in issue number 1 of _Community Libertarian_
on May Day, 1965; and "One, Two, Three Hands Clapping" in the first issue
of Avalanche (Berkeley) in 1966. Long a resident of San Francisco, Ron now
resides near Valley Forge, PA, a point from which he make regular trips to
the Kelly Writers House where he has led and joined PhillyTalks, read
"Albany" on "Live at the Writers House" (available here: www.english.
upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/silliman.html) and supported many emerging
writers.

Suppose Maria Zavialov was not working class.So what. You don't have to be
working class to talk about the working class. You don't have to labor a
bit or a lot to know about the working class.
So they were told a lot about the working class, maybe too much, maybe to
the point where it was very hard to believe in what they were told about
the working class. A certain repugnance probably set in.

Any working class person who has time to be on this list, I am glad
for you.

Group about whom we had been quite curious and now the issue (#89!!)
is ready.  Maybe it will open eyes all over the world about the
interesting new writing scene in Atlanta.  Anyhow, if anyone on this
list would like a copy please back-channel me and I'll send you one.
Please don't send money, this is a free offer and just send your
address instead (unless you think I know it by heart).  No solicitors
will call...

To page 247 now, and all and all I guess I quite like his _Last Avant
Garde_, as the readings are <exemplary> and full of care.  So the thing
about the intro statements, how they can ruffle non-seniority list
members who were not able to join the Company at the ground-floor
breaking of tradition (maybe we were only, like, 0-8 years old at the
time, too), well, can just let it go.  It's pretty innocuous, I guess.
His <Last> Avant-Garde seems more reverence and love than pronouncement
and control.  Much love, in fact, which is warm and clear.  What I
would, myself, "espouse" had I 'nuff time, talent, and persistence to
cover D. Bromige (David Brimbody) and B. Grenier (Robert Grinnear),
another avant-garde I don't want to be the lost.

No no no, i don't remember

        as commodity which is generally
         repudiated by those artists
        who might be described
         as avant garde. Novelty is
        a creature of time and unreliable,
         a bye product of experiment
        rather than an end."

it is misleading --- did i do it ?  i recall writing about someone at the
symposium in new orleans who'd thrown out the tern novelty in his screed
about the term experimental --- i dont recall the term avant garde coming
into it --- but i wd like to mention that novelty need not relate to
commodity and as its origin is in the 14th century it seems reasonably
disconnected to commodity culture circa now

        "What is more significant
         is the 'revolutionary' or
        oppositional nature of a text."

i see what yr saying here but i'm not sure that belief is compelled --- that
is, i find the discontinuity between the work of the italian futurists and
what had been going on up until then much more interesting, in and of itself
(it's novelty?) than i do they "revolutionary" attitudes of this group ----
as such it seems that its our needs that make X Y or Z "significant"

        "Meanwhile, in the marketplace,
         the  'novelty' of the avant garde
        signals just another item for sale
         -or so some would like to think.
        If the experimental only referred
         to technique, this might be so, but
        when  it refers to ideas or modes
         of thought, then it can constitute
        a challenge  to what Bernstein
         accurately terms'official verse culture' which
        (...)  is still very much  in place."

how much avant garde is available in the market place ? i've never seen any,
as such i wonder what this cd mean ultimately --- and the experimental, i'd
say has nothing to do with technique and is a cognitive relation to the work
not a style or technique that one can pick up put down at any time --- not
that i think many of us are writing experimental poetry --- i doubt we are
--- i maybe have written one poem deserving the name and seen a handful more
--- it seems to me that instead what most of us are engaged in is
improvization of one sort or another and with varying degrees of
guidelines/guard-rails etc

i dont dispute that there is an official verse culture but i don't feel
connected to it enough to be able to muster much of an oppositional attitude
towards it myself --- to be truly oppositional i wd have to pay attention to
official verse culture and there is so much better to be done with my time

        "To say it [the A-G] does not,
         and can not, exist is either
        wishful thinking or a form of cultural
         despair, a loss of faith
        not only in poetry, but also
         language, and thus - us."

must it be so stark ? i wd rather
have the supposedly avant garde character
of presentness and ditch the oppositionality

so i guess i'm not in the avant garde huh ?

Anyone know of work that's been done on machismo as implicit in
avant-garde values?  Or, on a more localized level, Olson and machismo
(i.e., "go by it, boys, rather than by,the metronome," and "there it is,
brothers, sitting there, for USE," "from the moment he ventures into
FIELD COMPOSITION--puts himself into the open" etc.).

A list of any articles / books that deal with this in one way or
another would be much appreciated.

If you like, backchannel to dkane@panix.com.

invitation to submit work to "on word"

Writers Forum's 1000th publication

_____________________________

As its 1000th publication, Writers Forum plans another special! It will be
called "on word" and will be as big as finance permits. This is an
invitation for you to send work for consideration for inclusion - but
*please read on first.

We hope to produce an eclectic anthology of investigative,
positively-experimental work, with supporting statements *where
*appropriate. We are interested in seeing work across the range of poetry
from linear verbal to non-verbal visual work by poets who, regardless of
gender or race, have in common their commitment to "making it new" - those
who are, in our judgement, still trying new things, open to ideas, still
surprising.

The proposed book is intended not just to provide a showcase of energetic
contemporary work, much of it not available through existing anthologies,
but also a bridge and speculative map into the new poetries being worked out
now.

Like WF750 the approach will be international.

We want to see contributions from younger poets, however one defines
"younger".

As a speculative book, attention will be paid to emerging forms and media
including approaches which cross traditional and accepted boundaries.
Ideally, the publication will include CDs to present aural performance, to
examine the use of colour, to present some of the work in "the emerging
technologies".

At present, we know that we are able to publish a print publication of
limited scale; further funding is being sought to enable us to fulfil our
wider ambitions.

For now, you are invited to send 4 (four) pages, camera ready. The size
should be in the proportion 210 (wide) : 297 (high).

Please send s.a.e. / i.r.c. for return of your work. If you are on email,
let us have your email address.

If it becomes possible to include CDs further announcements will be made.
All such announcements will be published at the WF website.

http:// matrix.crosswinds.net/members/~writersforum/

At present, all we want is work on paper.

These guidelines are intended to be self-explanatory; but if you have any
question, write to either editor with sae / irc or email Lawrence Upton on
lawrence.upton@britishlibrary.net

Submissions to "on word", which fit these guidelines (intended to save us
all wasting time), should be sent, with s.a.e. / i.r.c. to either:

Lawrence Upton
(WF1000)
32 Downside Road
Sutton
Surrey SM2 5HP
UK

or

Bob Cobbing
(WF1000)
89a Petherton Road
London N5 2QT

Subject:      WTO : reports of the police riot in Seattle
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Listmates : this ain't poetry nor poetics, but it has a foot in
kultur-kritik. I know how hard it can be to get any news that hasnt been
masticated then turned into daily rejectamenta by the corpsemedia---our
local paper, an organ of the NYT, airbrushed yesterday's reign of terror by
police forces, and had a fatuous editorial turning the violence of a dozen
anarchists and a handful of thugs (agents provocateurs?) into 5,000
peaceful protestors going ape. And so now we dont need to pay further
attention to any critcism of the WTO, because if we did criticize it, we'd
be nut-cases (as the Estonian delegate said).

Because I live within range of radio station kpfa, I am able to forward
eye-witness accounts heard  yesterday, by live feed from Seattle. And so I
shall---with apologies to those who would like to see this List stick to
its poetics mission.

These reports testify to "overkill" violence on the part of police forces
in Seattle. Faced with peaceful protests and passive resistance, the forces
of law-n-order fired rubber bullets pointblank at seated protestors, in
attempts to clear a 50-block area that the mayor had (with dubious
constitutionality) placed off-limits to free speech.

In many previous such demonstrations in other cities, protestors have been
removed by hands-on methods, with ultimate success for the police. In
Seattle, police fired rubber bullets into the faces of those who were in
their way, breaking teeth and raising grapefruit-sized welts. A young woman
who was among those helping out at a field station by tending the wounded,
said that many injured men had been shot in the groin, likewise pointblank.
Others had their wounds in the back, sustained as they complied with police
demands that they vacate the area. People were trapped in order to be
teargassed [note : as I saw happen at UC Berkeley in 1968] rather than
being allowed to disperse.

She also testified that she and other workers were ordered to remove the
red cross armbands they wore to identify themselves, and had their medical
supplies confiscated. This meant that protestors who had been teargassed
(often, also at pointblank range) were denied water and swabs to relieve
the pain of the searing and choking gas. She said, too, that (this in
contrast to wire-service reports today of "several injured") she and her
colleagues had treated more than a hundred sufferers.

I am a student of voices. This woman was telling the truth, on this I stake
myself....although I can well imagine the corporate media would, did they
have to deal with her at all, frame her as a dupe or tool.

The list of civil rights violations, physical or otherwise, could go on and
on, but this is e-mail, so I forbear.

Many of these police, in riot gear, displayed no badges nor was it possible
to know to which adminstrative unit they belonged----Seattle police, King's
County marshalls, Washington State police, Highway Patrol, federal agents,
National Guard. The Mayor has done some hand-wringing, but like it or not
he, Paul Schell, bears ultimate responsibility.

What one wants to do with this information is a seperate question. My
sympathies lie with those who believe we must find a way to ensure such
police-riots cannot be permitted (as surely this one was encouraged) to
occur again.

In a move to compel the Mayor and his supporters to bear this
responsibility, and to persuade the administrations of other cities in
future situations where civil disobedience occurs, not to allow their
police to go mad-dog (then wring their hands upon the fait accompli), many
of us are urging a one-year boycott of the city of Seattle. We are trying
to reach the Mayor to let him know the terms of this boycott. We think it
should last for one year unless there is further police brutality today, in
which case it should be extended to two years, and so on.

The boycott---based upon the grounds that Seattle cannot police its own
police, thereby rendering the city unsafe to any persons---asks that you
not travel to Seattle any time between Dec 5, 1999, and Dec. 5, 2000. If
you need to drive thru the city, please gas up and get food in communities
on either side of the city. The point is to spend no money in Seattle. Yes,
this will bring hardship to innocent merchants and employees, but Seattle
authorities escalated these proceedings into a war, and in a war, innocent
people do get hurt. There is no other way to bring pressure upon
authorities to restrain their police. At best one gets an official inquiry,
which exonerates the wrong-doers. If we can hit Seattle in the  money-belt,
those who feel the pinch the most will exert their own pressure on rogue
officials. An example will be made of Seattle to prevent any repetition of
such police overkill, in any other venue.

With an outfit such as the WTO, consisting of delegates not elected by us,
yet empowered to overturn our labor and environmental laws, there is
nowhere to take our disagreement but to the streets---there, and the Net.
The corpsemedia will distort these issues beyond sense. Ergo, the streets
have to made safer for demonstrators. Or do we want a future where an
unreachable WTO wrecks our lives and our one arena of action is owned by
uniformed sadists?

Cities will have to live with the fact that the USA allows peaceful
assembly of dissidents. There are going to be people in the street for as
long as we are denied other avenues to protest the undemocratic rule of the
WTO---which can overturn national and state and local environmental laws,
which can force our nation to import the products of child- and
slave-labor, and which can bring about further export of jobs from the USA
to countries with no regulatory sanctions that protect their workers or
their environment. In the meantime, cities must not be allowed to get away
with super-violence faits accomplis.

The President himself told the WTO yesterday that he approved of the
peaceful protestors being in the streets---at the same time that police
were carrying out this violence against these president-approved persons.
Judge for yourself whether this was cynical on his part or not....perhaps
he is merely a dupe.

Further sanctions are possible, and one would be to refuse to buy any
product manufactured in Seattle.

Please spread the word, and qualify the consequences for fascism in
whatever way you wish.

Thanks for your attention.

David Bromige.

So what would it look like, _The Best American Poetry Online_, culled
from 75 experimental hypertext mags, if say three-four-five hundred
experimental poets each pitched in 20 small bucks for their own two
copies a piece and maybe another 20 little dollars to get a coupla
copies into every Bans and Ignoble and Aborters big comfortable public
libraries/stores in the country?  Some cunning <buyers group brokering>
with Amazon.com and the publishers and others could also help...

Two responses:

Kathy:
* I'm glad we're on somewhat of the same wavelength re: a writer's
personal relation to class. I'm not sure if it's useful to bring up a
discussion of the politics of criticsm, but I do feel that class is used
as a blind for race -- for example, in affirmative action discussions,
opponents often bring up the upperclass status of a particular black
student as an argument against.

The question of a writer's relation to his class -- does anyone know of a
critic who goes in to such issues in an explicitly Marxist way? I think --
perhaps -- Bakhtin, in _Dost. Poetics_ -- but it's been awhile.

Maria:
* I'm not complaining (at all) that Byron is being attacked for being
white. I'm just saying that a political criticism of Byron will focus on
his whiteness more than his class in this "day 'n' age". But perhaps we
should all stop writing/reading poetry and work on the free Mumia
campaign.

There're probably some interesting connections to make between what John's
bringing up here viz "official verse culture" and the avant garde, the
recent issues of class that have found their way onto the List, and the
recent events in Seattle, particularly possible responses to it, as outlined
in David Bromige's post, but I'm not clear on exactly what these
(connections) might comprise.  It's weird

to think that perhaps the "oppositional" status between "official verse
culture" and the avant garde are only oppositional within a particular frame
of reference, perhaps in ways similar to the Seattle battles between
officialdom and protestors against officialdom's apparent power - very like
the usual game of cops and robbers, a vying for power pointed toward those
that already have it, hoping for exchange, hoping to be heard, hoping after
some form of power one can keep for themselves, or use in a better way than
those who currently wield it to bust heads, balls, unions or whatever seems
to stand in the way of "moving forward" , wch I assume means toward material
gain, or, for those in opposition, what? - a more just world?  But in terms
of what ideal or out of what

labyrinthine sacrificial pit are such judgements made, ie., who's an
"outsider" and what are they outside of?  There are a lot of troubling
questions here.  At the front line of what struggle, exactly, does the avant
garde do its stuff?  Are cops working class?  Were the bulk of the
protestors in Seattle working class?  Was Marx working class?  Or, not to
get so ridiculous as to ask whether the Marx Brothers were working class, &
to shift directions, are the working class capable of self-rule?  Do workers
need bosses like bosses need workers?  Is human consciousness in fact
capable of some degree of self-regulation that would lead to the creation of
a state of affairs in wch something other than bared teeth rules?  And if
so, how does this mode of thinking translate into action, into form?  Is
that what the avant garde has always posed itself as, new forms of thinking
that may "trickle down" into the common polis without being in some wise
simply ghettoized or elevated as just another aesthetic avenue to the
immaterial?  And is "official verse culture" a way to sandbag the flood of
change those who already have power and/or status are always afraid is just
around the corner?  And is it?  Or what of "anarchistic" ideas expressed in
modes common to "official verse culture" - who will read them?  Who
comprises the working class?  Or what percentage of that class is interested
in radical ideas and change enough to spend real time examining the ways in
wch either and/or both the avant garde or "official verse culture" propose
change.  Or how much is a "necessity" of change foisted upon those who often
haven't yet the means to understand or determine what their own place(s) in
such "new systems" might be?  We are all

put in a state of perpetual trespass against ourselves because of our own
inabilities to get outside of our own isolation, and so our ideas about all
of the above (and more) become isolating traumas, albeit perpetually
expressed.  "The powers that be" may be our own ability to endure under the
isolation and stress that are a result of either being possessed or bereft
of exactly those powers, rather than the power itself, wch, disembodied as
it also is in us, is a very difficult thing to identify, as are we,
remaining as we do at its behest, under order.  Yet therefore also, always
"in" substance.  The argument is, what are we gonna DO with it, about it,
for it, against it - the problem is vectoral: where are we going?  Forget
the "reasons"; give me the directions.  (or, forget the bandaid: give me the
finger.)

Responses to the initial call for submissions have shown up some ambiguities
and omissions in that call. So...

(1) It says: "The size should be in the proportion 210 (wide) : 297 (high)".
210 mm x 297 mm is A4 paper and we realise that such paper is not readily
available world-wide; but we hope you will set your word-processor to custom
size, or shift the margins, or rule up your drawing paper accordingly. It is
likely that the actual published page size will be less than A4 so make sure
that you use a type size which will cope with reduction!

So: work in that ratio, 210:297, and be prepared for us to print at anything
down to a regular paperback

(2) We prefer previously  unpublished work, but will consider published
work. Please state details of any previous publication.

(3) i.r.c. means international reply coupon - a way of sending us stamps
across national borders - feel free though to just give an email if you
don't actually need return so we can email you saying yes or no

(4) This is an international invitation. Work from poets of all countries is
welcome if it fits the guidelines

(5) Funds permitting, the book will be professionally printed. If they do
not permit then it will be photocopied in-house and professionally bound. So
"camera-ready" means "as long as we don't have to retype it etc". Laser
prints, ink jets, decent photocopies and so on should be fine as long as
they're not running low on toner. (For those of you who know the 750th
publication of WF - WORD SCORE UTTERANCE CHOREOGRAPHY - the introductory
pages were mastered on a sheet feed desk top laser which cost about 100 UK
pounds

(6) There will be an index, but do consider putting your name on the page as
an integral part of the image to be reproduced.

(7) Don't include page numbers because they will be incorrect when they are
in the book. Pencil numbers on the back of the pages to show correct order.

(8) Choice of type face etc is entirely up to you

The desultory thread on Lehman's book is interesting, full of mild and
slightly positive sentiment.

The dynamix of the list are perhaps somewhat illustrated by this;
including the rapid turnover of regulars;  ...When the book first came
out, if memory serves, there was rather a lot of more engaged and heated
discussion... Much of it pretty negative indeed.  Among other fascinating
aspects of the 'net, and this list, (all lists)  is the quick and almost
automatic "loss of memory" ..

Oh, and of course: the group which has just edited the new issue of Mirage
#4 is the APG, not the AWG...

Mime-Version: 1.0

Thank you very much David, for your post about the situation in Seattle.
For those of us mostly dependent upon mass-media outlets, it's been
difficult to get a true sense of the situation and I much appreciate your
information.

However, if you'll allow me, I do take some issue with this, from your
post:

"The point is to spend no money in Seattle. Yes,
this will bring hardship to innocent merchants and employees, but Seattle
authorities escalated these proceedings into a war, and in a war, innocent
people do get hurt. There is no other way to bring pressure upon
authorities to restrain their police."

While I'm certainly no expert on how to restrain police, I'm rather a
devotee of the idea that the ends does not justify the means--that the
means rather is how one defines oneself and redefines modus operandi for
others. Thus I'm quite hesitant to do anything where "innocent people get
hurt" no matter what the "justification." One of the major points of the
protests was to demonstrate against bad working conditions. If you
boycott a "good" business with "good" labor practices, you're, well,
cutting off your nose...etc. subverting your own intentions and
dishonoring those who were in the line of fire in the first place. What
if one of those with a "grapefruit" sized welt is actually the owner of a
some bookstore, or eco-company, or even a gas station with decent pay for
its employees, and, after protesting, this person returns to her/his
business only to find that those who supported her/him, are now
destroying their livelihood?

I'd suggest instead targetting your boycott against those companies who
support the WTO, write letters to the Mayor & media outlets, network with
fellow protesters in Seattle to let them know we support them, and most
important, keep the real news circulating.  I know it's not as dramatic
and immediate a solution, but it sure makes "us" different from "them."

All best wishes,
Marcella Durand

 Gorgeous Plunge
 Michael Gottlieb

Given the format of "language" and all the resonance of that inexorable
surface, Michael Gottlieb leaps from echo to "every aging minute"--and
onward, leaving a shimmering track of impressive brilliance.  Words never
had it so good nor did anyone ever so track them to their lair, wherein
they at last cry out, "I'd like to say," or "Having said that," or "You
never know." -- Robert Creeley

In Michael Gottlieb's Gorgeous Plunge, poets are the "we" of it. My
generation at last, vanishing on the horizon. It's poetry--squibs of it,
streams of it, pithy spoonfuls and dropped doses--one last squeeze of the
tube-- that narrates by position of its clock hands--much like the narrator
does in Robert Musil's epic The Man Without Qualities--the difficult and
even giddy moment in which one faces one's culture and understands in a
mute turning, what it is to be a man. --Eileen Myles

In the continuing battle between life and death at the end of the century,
Michael Gottlieb's Gorgeous Plunge declares itself on the side of life. As
a phenomenal account of self-consciousness within structures it can only
partially authorize, Michael Gottlieb's work addresses the broad horizons
of utopia, the chilling defiles of the economy, and the scrutable
immediacies of everyday life. --Barrett Watten


Michael Gottlieb is the author of eight books of poetry including Local
Color/Eidetic Deniers, Ninety-Six Tears (also published by Roof Books), New
York and The River Road. His work has appeared in magazines and anthologies
for the past twenty years. In the late 70s and early 80s he helped edit one
of Language Poetry's seminal periodicals, Roof Magazine. A child of the
suburbs, Michael Gottlieb presently lives in Northwestern Connecticut with
his wife and two children.

Unfortunately, David, to be quite frank, Amerika DOES NOT allow peaceful
assembly that much any more.  The legal protections for peaceful protesters
have been disappearing for a long time.

Amerika is a police state.  Your only protection in Amerika is money,
connections.

Land of the free, home of the brave
is really
land of the fee, home of the knave.

And then, lest we forget, there's always agent provocateur activities within
many political movements in the US, people paid to make the peaceful look
violent.

This was a wonderful note, David.  I am very glad you shared it with
everyone.  What you are saying in your note is indeed what is going on.  I
have a good friend who is at Capitol Hill in the middle of it and I am
worried about him.

Under a state of emergency, the city of Seattle made it illegal to use a
gaskmask, and the penalty is 180 days in jail and/or a large fine.

Patrick

Does anyone have an updated email address for Lisa Robertson?

Can someone help me with this?

Is there one of you out there who would go to the trouble of looking up
Lisa Robertson's email address for me, one that is current?

Can I possibly ask someone to look up an email address for me?

COLLATERAL DAMAGE IN SEATTLE
by Portland student/reporter Jim Desyllas

Called-in from a pay phone outside Seattle. Wed., 7:30 pm Pacific time.

(Posted at www.emperors-clothes.com  12-2-99.  Feel free to distribute
in
full including this note.)

I just spent 4 days in Seattle. The "information" people are getting
from the
mass media is false. This was not, as Pres. Clinton claims, a peaceful
protest marred by the actions of violent protesters. This was a massive,
strong but peaceful demonstration which was attacked repeatedly by the
police
with the express purpose of provoking a violent response to provide
photo
opportunities for the Western media. I know because I watched it
happening.
I'll tell you how they did it.

As Michel Chossudovsky says in his "Disarming the New World Order" (See
Note
# 1 at end for link to that article) - the government put a lot of
effort
into making sure the protesters in Seattle were a "loyal opposition" who
wanted to reform the WTO, not get rid of it. But the people in Seattle -
American steel workers, Canadian postal workers, college kids from all
over,
environmentalists from Australia - you name it - were not for reforming
the
WTO. They were for getting rid of it.

And this wasn't just true of the protesters. I interviewed delegates.
None of
them had anything favorable to say about the WTO. Two delegates from the
Caribbean were angry about job loss. One delegate from Peru took a
bullhorn
and got up on a car and spoke to the protestors against the World Trade
Organization. He said it hurts the workers and farmers. I interviewed a
Norwegian guy from Greenpeace. Totally against it. Even a delegate from
Holland said it had hurt the farmers there. He said though it is
supposedly
democratic, that's actually a lie: the US, England and Canada and a few
others get together and decide what they want to do. Then they ask the
rest
of the countries to vote and if they vote wrong they threaten,"You won't
get
loans," or whatever. They get them to do what they want by blackmailing
them.
The Italians we interviewed were upset too. I couldn't find any
delegates who
were in favor.

So the government instigated a "riot" to discredit the movement against
the
WTO because they couldn't dilute it. I am not guessing about this. I was
there. I saw it happening. And I will tell you I am frankly shocked to
see,
close up, just how little our leaders care what happens to ordinary
people.
Clinton can pose and speak a lot of flowery stuff but the truth is - we
are
nothing to them. I saw this with my own eyes.

Sunday and Monday, there was no violence. None. The people were
aggressively
non-violent; they were self-policing. Up until Tuesday at 4pm there was
one
window broken in the whole city - a McDonalds window. This compares
favorably
to the typical rock concert, let alone a demonstration of people who
were
non-violently barring entry to the World Trade Center!

At this point, a new group of police - tactical police - moved in and
started
gassing people and shooting rubber bullets. Is it any surprise that
people
got mad? Of course, the young kids hit back by breaking some windows in
retaliation for being gassed, sprayed with very painful pepper gas, and
shot
with dangerous "rubber" bullets. The police instigated these kids, plain
and
simple.

Sunday and Monday they had young cops, using them to block the streets.
These
were trainees. But Tuesday they had the real cops; none of them were
young.
They were trained to attack people. A small group, maybe 100 people
total,
struck back. Then these cops herded that group around the city, making
sure
there were plenty of photo ops of "violent protesters."

A number of times they had these 100 or so protesters caught between
buildings and walls of police. They could easily have arrested and
detained
this small number of people and gotten it over with. Instead they would
gas
them and let them go. Then trap them again, gas them again, and again
let
them go. The cops made no arrests that I know of until late Tuesday
night
though the skirmishing was going on from three till 9:30. The cops would
blockade three or five blocks of an area, give the angry kids room to
operate, keep gassing them - when you gas a person, let me tell you, it
gets
them fighting mad.

Tuesday night the police gassed all of downtown. This was going on from
3 PM,
till 6 PM.. Gas everywhere. The kids broke a few windows - McD's,
Starbucks -
small stuff - burned a few garbage cans. The police were using these
people
as extras. It was staged. I believe also the police had their own people
in
there, encouraging people to break stuff - if people think I may be
exaggerating, I saw supposed protesters - they were screaming and so on
- and
then later, when everything was over, the same people tackled other
protestors and put handcuffs on them.

At 6pm they issued a State of Emergency. At that point they had pushed
the
100 people outside the city limits, so the police went outside the
limits
too, and they started gassing that area too, gassing the neighborhoods
where
the regular people live. I am not exaggerating. The police were
relentless.

This was in an area from the city limits for about 10 blocks to the
Seattle
Central Community College. If you were alive, the police gassed you.

coming back from work, kids, women, everyone. People would go out of
their
houses to see what was happening because these tear gas guns sound like
a
cannon - and they would get gassed. A block away there was a Texaco gas
station - they threw tear gas at gas pumps, believe it or not - they
were
like vandals. They gassed a bus. I saw it with my own eyes. A bus. The
driver, the riders, the people just abandoned it .

I was sitting in a little coffee shop called Rauhaus, [Jim did not spell
this
- the spelling may be wrong.] They were shooting "rubber" bullets at the
glass. I picked up a dozen of the things in a few square feet. They were
also
shooting this paint that you can only see with a florescent light. They
would
paint anyone and everyone and then go hunting them.

Anyway, because they were gassing everybody, the local people got mad
too and
they joined the 100 who had been herded out of the city. So soon there
were
500 including the neighborhood people and all very angry. Naturally.
Because
they had been gassed and hit with pepper spray, that stuff does a number
on
you. And shot with these damn bullets. Then people set up barricades at
Seattle Central Community College. The cops organized themselves for
about an
hour and then moved in and gassed that area.

Today they started mass arrests. That was because Clinton - the Greeks
call
him the Planitarchis, Ruler of the World - was coming. Weeping crocodile
tears about how he just LOVES peaceful protest, which of course you'd
have to
be two years old to believe he had nothing to do with the police action.
This
whole thing, this police attack, this was US foreign policy, not some
action
decided by some bureaucrat in Seattle. This was the State Department.
They
wanted to discredit the people.

When things started on Sunday,  there was a protest rally of solidarity
involving people from different walks of life. Monday it got even
bigger.
Tuesday there was a big sort of carnival where people were doing
different
things, a band was playing music and people were blocking the World
Trade
Center. And about 3 PM the cops started throwing tear gas.

The thing that drove Clinton crazy was that on Tuesday the protesters
had
succeeded in making nonviolent human chains and had therefore stopped
everyone from going into the World Trade Center. Only maybe 27 delegates
got
through, mostly US and British. There were what seemed like tens of
thousands
of protesters involved. So the police did their gassing number against
these
nonviolent people to break up the human chains and make the protesters
look
violent.

Today (Wednesday) I followed the union protest put together by the
Longshoremen's Union. They went down to the docks and had a rally then
marched to Third Avenue. As soon as they got there the cops started
gassing
them. There was an old lady there. She had gone downtown by bus to buy
something. This lady was in her 70's and I saw her trying to run, but
she
couldn't breathe. She was in shock. I carried her to a building
entryway. She
was gasping, terrified. She had been in Germany, and it was like she was
having flashbacks. The tear gas sounds like gunfire and there were
helicopters overhead, sirens, cops on horses, everything.

They had clearly made a decision to destroy this movement.

So anyway there I was with her in this building and she wanted to go to
the
hospital but there was tear gas everywhere and I was afraid if I tried
to
move her she'd be gassed again. I went to this line of cops and begged -
I
mean begged - these riot police to help her. They ignored me. A girl
told me
later that a one year old had been gassed. And I myself saw a girl no
more
than 18 - a cop had busted her lip wide open - she was bleeding - and
then
they gassed everyone including her. After that she was kneeling on the
ground
crying like a baby and praying for 15 minutes, Hail Mary, Hail Mary.
Over and
over. She was in a state of shock. They just gassed these people who
were
sitting down non-violently and doing nothing. Nothing.

At one point the Seattle Mayor said his boys were not using rubber
bullets.
Miraculously, by then I had ten in my pocket. I could open a little
market,
sell the things. They are everywhere. I and other people started giving
them
to delegates and stuff. "See what they're doing? They're shooting
"rubber"
bullets and lying about it." We showed them to the media. I guess enough
people and the media got the information because the Mayor made a new
statement then that they were using them. As if he hadn't known.

They shot rubber bullets from four feet away into the face of a guy next
to
me, broke all his front teeth. When that happened I lost it. I forgot I
was
supposed to be getting the news for all of you and I started yelling at
the
cops, "What the hell is wrong with you? Are you sick, man?" So this cop
aimed
his gun right at me. That was his answer. So I first put my hands in
front of
my face because I didn't want to lose my teeth. And then I thought, to
hell
with it. I was wearing my target shirt that said "Collateral Damage",
you
know? With a bullseye target, like they wore during the bombing in
Yugoslavia. And I told this guy, "Go ahead, shoot! Here! Here's the
target!"
He didn't shoot me.

I want to emphasize, these protesters were NOT violent people. They were
the
most non-violent people I have ever seen. Even when I was screaming at
the
cop, this girl came up to me and said, "Do not scream. This is
non-violent."
These people were too much to believe. They must meditate all the time,
I
don't know.

Clinton said he supports nonviolent protest. That is baloney. Today
(Wed.)
the protesters were causing absolutely no "trouble". In downtown the
cops had
people running who weren't even protesters - like that old lady or just
people going to work or shopping - everyone was getting gassed. The
busses
weren't running because of the gas. I was lucky to catch one with a
driver
who could still see. I begged him to drive the old lady home - the
driver
changed his route especially for her. If you want to find human decency,
stay
away from the Planitarchis. Go to the to regular people. They have some.
The
Planitarchis lost all his years ago. Now he wouldn't know human decency
if it
came up and bit him.

So now I have made personal acquaintance with the people who run this
country, and they are quite simply scum. There were people at work,
people
with babies, they were all getting gassed because the government would
not
allow an assembly of people speaking their minds. It is the same as what
happened in Athens. Clinton's requirements on the Greek government
created
the riot and he did the same thing here. And then he says he supports
nonviolent protest? How? By shooting rubber bullets? And today they
outlawed
gas masks. They want to make sure everyone gets his money's worth.

Today, just like yesterday night, the police were in the residential
neighborhoods. People in cafés were getting gassed and shot at, you
could
hear it on the windows, bang, bang, bang. A guy trying to cross the
street to
go to his house got gassed. First a drunk guy outside a bar yelled at
the
cops "Get out of here!" so they gassed him. And then this other guys was
just
crossing the street to go home so the cops figured, might as well gas
him
too. People got gassed for coming out of restaruants and bars and
coffeee
shops. I'm amazed that nobody died who had asthma or something.

Or maybe somebody did die and they didn't talk about it. I mean after
all,
it's just collateral damage..

why would one want to make a Book out of Online work?  would that
"validate" it somehow?  or make it a more marketable Commodity?

and why would one want to arbitrate for others what is "The Best"

give another the power to arbiter that work for them?

Is this the CLASS LIST or the POETICS LIST? I'm mainly a lurker, but I've been
reading, or at least skimming, everyone's posts for months and it seems to me
that ALL ANYONE EVER TALKS ABOUT IS CLASS.

OK, I'm exaggerating, but seriously: Are you people writers or civil rights
activists? Is discussion of a poem's actual structure or technique or craft to
be disdained courtesy of the old PC argument that only people who are wealthy
enough to have a certain amount of time on their hands can afford to pay
attention to poetry? Obviously we ALL have at least that much time on our hands
-- so why does the discussion always turn to how people's
(class/race/gender/blah blah blah) informs their work? The ways in which a
writer's life informs her/his work are, I agree, useful or interesting in a
discussion of said work, and (class/race/gender/blah blah blah) is certainly
part of every writer's life, but it seems to me that many of you are focusing on
that part to the exclusion of other interesting things. It might be good for you
to get off your collective classes once in a while.

Well, now we can bring this back to poetics. Tom is correct to
contextualize my sentence--not at all "casual"---but it is odd that he then
worries that I will forget context and start down some metaphorical
slippery slope.... It's as if I was trying to rid myself of a fly and you,
Tom, passing the window, heard me cry "Kill it!" and ran to phone the
cops...Keep on jammin', bro. David

THEORY:

Those POLICE were not Seattle's.  Such operatives were guarding the
Bildersburger Group meeting in Atlanta at which a presumptive friend of many
on this list -Hillary Rodham Clinton- spoke in 1997.

Know the enemy.  Ask yourselves one question:  Is Justice Bork a member of

Subject:      poets & our cliches
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

        To amplify (and to clarify, i hope)  my response to tom raworth's
post : when i used the cliche "in war, innocent people do get hurt", tom
transferred it from where he got it (a highly contextualized situation, as
he initially acknowledged, in which "hurt" is economic) to images of
refugees being bombed... however he got down that slippery slope, he then
employed the cliche "slippery slope" to warn me lest i lay aside my pen and
pick up my uzi.

But when i heard tom's anxiety as encoded in "s.s.", ," i thought of "grave
misgivings", a bleeding-heart liberal cliche excuse for doing nothing, and
even of "it wouldnt be prudent," a fascist excuse for doing nothing. tom
conjured me leading the easily misled, from economic sanctions to
blitzkrieg; hence his "slippery slope." but i have no further ambitions
concerning czeckoslovakia, except to learn how to spell it.   i am
surprised to have the "slippery slope" sanctions imposed upon me, by a man
who must have had as many friends as i, imprisoned by those authorities on
marijuana who know it always leads to heroin.

Anyway, let me say further re economic sanctions against seattle that, as
david antin says, in approving the notion, it will be hard to get the word
out. agreed, so we dont expect this action to bring catastrophic hardship
to any one person. a reduction, maybe, of 3% in annual profits. but the
effect is cumulative, and what we hope for is sufficient reduction in
seattle's income to have a negative impact on their budget, so that certain
"essential" services--we suggest, the police--have to be cut back. it is
the police, first and foremost, who need to be taught a lesson in
restraint.

But too, it is the city adminstrators who slip the police's leashes, who
have to learn the hard way, and when big stores lose 3%, thats a lot of
latte, and a corresponding increase in  pressure on city hall to consider
the consequences of police violence.

The purpose of this, as i understand it, is not primarily punitive but
minatory---to prevent future demonstrations from being clobbered by city
hall in other venues.

i like david antin's suggestion re microsoft. of course, already existing
product from m.s has to be considered as grandfathered in. but for the next
year, it wd be great if bill gates (a mighty fan of the w.t.o.) received
less income from us outraged & nugatory chickens at the far end of the
coop.

Subject:      class way of not talking about race, etc...
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

The reason I brought up the "screening" that class is sometimes used for
is that, for me, the "avant-garde" is divided up far more by race than by
class. For me, this is really obvious in a University situation (yes,
there are working class people there -- the question of "cultural class"
notwithstanding), where the "spoken word" is largely a black domain and
writers who cross over from more NY school derivative poetries are mostly
white. When I was down in NYC, interestingly, there was not the same kind
of perception -- Nuyorican, for example, is thrilling in its ethnic mix.

The one place where this is absent -- particularly interesting -- is among
people doing work in electronic music or "new music". Perhaps the
explicitness of "trade" (there's a specific body of knowledge needed to
claim membership that can be -- somewhat -- objectively evaluated) that
isn't present in poetry (where there's a greater empahsis on 'talent', and
less background needed) keeps racial questions in the background. I say
this, by the way, as someone who knows little about the politics of new
music -- just as a audience member looking at the racial composition of
the rooms.

The grammar of Simon's first post would not have suggested the intention
clarified in his more recent -- BUT -- still seems a peculiar shade of red
herring to me --  I am not now nor have a ever been a "Byronist,"  but I
have not seen any citations ever of critial work "attacking" Byron for
being white, nor have I seen any citations of any critical work looking at
his "whiteness."  Does anybody out there know of such an article, which I'd
like to see -- There ARE books and articles that offer analyses of race in
Romanticism, which may inclue Byron --

Not only do the North American "whiteness studies" bunch not concern
themselves with Byron, they tend not to address poetry at all

Race has often been blinded by class -- and there have been attempts to
trump race with class (such as William J. Wilson's works) -- The class
argument in discussions of Affirmative Action takes a truly odd turn --
People criticize Affirmative Action for getting upper-middle-class people
into certain universities as if (1) they really DID want to see large
numbers of poorer people at Yale and (2) as if Affirmative Action had been
designed as an economic class remedy, which it surely was not --

While I would in fact like to see economically disadvantaged candidates
given a better shot at the best education, I've never understood the logic
that claims it is immoral to consider race as an affirmative action remedy
in college admissions (as opposed to, say, the action that got George W.
through the Ivy League) while it would be moral to admit a candidate from a
lower-income family over a candidate from an upper-inome family whose
record was otherwise comparable --

Class certainly plays a major role in the current establishment of creative
writing in the academy, as any of the people teaching in Cal State's
programs might tell you after a visit to a U.C. program -- a role just as
prominent as race -

When minority applicants are turned down for home loans that white
applicants with otherwise comparable records receive, it's an action based
in race that has the effect of rigidifying class structures at the same time --

I think what many of us would like to see is a critique that is
simultaneously attuned to race and class in its readings and analyses (and
writings!), rather than a critique that pretends to be able to extricate
one from the other --

any volunteers?

Hi - I'm asking everyone to participate in the TRACEROUTE PROJECT, which
really occurs on December 31 and January 1. Traceroute is a utility which
comes with the unix or linux operating system - there is a version in
Win95 and Win98 called tracert. It is a way to track the path from your
computer to a site anywhere in the world. For example, if you are in
Australia, at Murdoch University, you could type

tracert columbia.edu

at the DOS prompt in Windows 95 0r 98, and you would have a chart of the
route between Murdoch and Columbia University in New York, USA.

Traceroute or tracert works by looking at the route between your computer
and your target address, and sending signals to every machine between the
two - three signals (usually) per machine. The machines then send return
signals, and traceroute gives you the round-trip time for each of the
three.

Traceroute is used by system administrators and people like me to look at
the "health" of the Internet as a whole - it tells you which machines
aren't responding, for example (those which send back asterix such as *).
It's incredibly useful.

Between December 31 and January 1, almost all the Y2k problems on the Net
will be visible thorugh traceroute. The idea of this project is to gather
a huge sheaf of data, illustrating the world-wide state of the Internet as
the millennium starts. (The millennium takes a day to start world-wide,
because of the time zones.)

What I would like from participants is a group of traceroutes sent to
Trace (we'll let you know where), accompanied by your name.  There is some
technical information below (taken from a few posts I made) that indicates
how to do this. It would also be great if you could include a description
of Y2k problems in your location - for example, subways out, flickering
lights, and so forth - and give your location as well. All of this will be
included in the final report.

None of this will be graphic or great looking - but it will be an amazing
compendium of the state of the earth at a critical time for humanity...

Please participate! Please post questions here!

Alan - and thank you!

(Below is the information from the other posts - you can ignore this if it
is too technical.)

I would like to start, almost immediately, thinking about doing TRACEROUTE
(traceroute) commands in linux or unix across the millennial hinge (i.e.
during the day the time shifts over), reporting back on speed etc. between
nodes etc. as the millennium arrives and Y2k does or does not come to
fruition. Please let me know if you are interested in participating - you
would have to have access to some traceroute program, and the ability to
convert the results to a text file; we'll try and establish a site for
placing these...

Here is some additional information from correspondence with Steen - Alan

And here is additional information. If you are on Windows 95 or 98, and
can access DOS (I'm not sure about G3 or G4 or IMac but there must be
utilities available):


Some tools for using with the Traceroute Project for Windows (tested for
Win98):


PING:

Usage: ping [-t] [-a] [-n count] [-l size] [-f] [-i TTL] [-v TOS]
[-r count] [-s count] [[-j host-list] | [-k host-list]]
[-w timeout] destination-list

Options:
-t Ping the specifed host until stopped.
To see statistics and continue - type Control-Break;
To stop - type Control-C.
-a Resolve addresses to hostnames.
-n count Number of echo requests to send.
-l size Send buffer size.
-f Set Don't Fragment flag in packet.
-i TTL Time To Live.
-v TOS Type Of Service.
-r count Record route for count hops.
-s count Timestamp for count hops.
-j host-list Loose source route along host-list.
-k host-list Strict source route along host-list.
-w timeout Timeout in milliseconds to wait for each reply.


TRACERT (traceroute):

Usage: tracert [-d] [-h maximum_hops] [-j host-list] [-w timeout]
target_name

Options:
-d Do not resolve addresses to hostnames.
-h maximum_hops Maximum number of hops to search for target.
-j host-list Loose source route along host-list.
-w timeout Wait timeout milliseconds for each reply.

NETSTAT:

Active Connections

Proto Local Address Foreign Address State


Netstat tells you the Network statistics; both tracert and ping are very
configurable. As you may know, you can also do ftp and telnet from the
prompt.

If you do, say, tracert to panix.com, you would do tracert panix.com >
trace.txt for example - which places the output in trace.txt. You may have
to go back in and add the command "tracert panix.com" to the top of the
file. If you then want to do, say, tracert trace.ntu.ac.uk and put it in
trace.txt next, you would do tracert trace.ntu.ac.uk >> trace.txt The
double carets >> mean "add to" and not "replace" - otherwise the trace.txt
will be replaced. The same goes for ping or other commands.

This way, you can build up a file of traceroutes to send on - configured
as you see fit. You might also use ping at times.

I tried to keep this brief.

First - to John, I wasn't referring to you in my comments and am at a loss
as to why you think so. I now have to say I'll admit I'm not good with
email, it's too fast, like conversation, and in a certain mood I open my big
mouth and get carried away, by the end of it I was working up to full Celtic
warrior/bush lawyer mode (an hour later I
was recalling all the ellisions and generalizations of my post).
Re novelty: the usual sense of the term avant garde encompasses this quality
and I thought (could be wrong) it was mentioned in the post on the Lehmann
book. Avant garde poetries frequently cite the importance of new forms, new
languages, new possibilities, not necessarily from a belief in the essential
virtue of the new but out of a sense of the inadequacies of orthodoxy.
As for the association with commodities, I appreciate it wasn't made in the
fourteenth century but, in Australia at least, all words referring to
novelty or newness have become advertising staples to an extent that
compromises their usage in any other area. (This doesn't even begin to
address the issue of art as commodity, though I'd be
interested to see what others have to say.)
Re: 'revolutionary' texts -  Just to clarify my use of opposition - I'm
thinking in terms of modes of thinking and writing rather than beliefs or
'attitudes'. Of course, each feeds the other but, to put it in the crudest
terms, I don't see the avant garde functioning as propagandists or prophets
(though some have sought such roles). In
fact, I dislike any characterisation of the poet which romanticises the
occupation or endows it with a questionable authority. '(Reader could be
writer, writer reader. Listener could be teacher.)' (DuPlessis) *
As for the intrinsic oppositional nature of the avant garde, I offer a
quotation from a much more useful text than this posting - "Robert Stearns
writes (in a configuration we would share with him): 'The avant garde might
be characterised as those creators who do not take their environment & its
traditions at face value. They separate & view its elements & realign them
according to their own needs.' This description (while devoid as yet of
social revolutionary purpose) is general enough to include the great range
of strategies & stances in experimental poetry & art." - Rothenberg and
Joris in the introduction to Vol. 1, Poems for the Millenium.
In this context I mention, without exploring, Paul Fussell's analysis of an
adversarial cast of mind which derives from the experiences of the Great War
(The Great War and Modern Memory). What is most germane is not the
combatants' sense of the Enemy, although this is profound, but the division
between the troops and the General Staff/civilian society, and a developing
sense of the fraudulence of authority, be it
militiary, political or cultural.
Re: marketplace - what can I say - I didn't mean it quite literally, but
avant garde poetry/writing is for sale, surely, unless you access it on the
net. In addition, the poetic economy is a little more complex than the
exchange of goods for money, income is more commonly generated by funding
and/or teaching positions but these, of course, are in some measure
dependant on publication. In any case, if you check my original post, I did
double back on that clause. Bit it on the bum, as it were. Similiarly, with
the reference to technique. Still, I'll admit this is one of the sections of
my post which I felt had weaknesses, too many leaps, setting up of possibly
artificial distinctions (and what distinctions aren't? Well, quite.), and
yet raising issues that I'm interested in and would like to read other posts
on. I don't mind admitting that I know very little and am trying to figure
it all out. I'm not avant garde either but I am
experimenting inasmuch as I try to see what I can do with language, and I'm
not too keen on repeating myself (though it happens, it happens).
Improvisation? Of course.
Re: technique. Questions. Collage has been described as a major innovation
in poetic technique. Clearly, whilst it is a technique, it's also intimately
connected with certain ideas about reality and poetics. However, the
technique can be used by those who, for a variety of reasons, do not partake
of the theoretic grounding from which collage derives. The appearance of
being avant garde is there, but what else?- I'm thinking of a well-known
scandal in the Australian literary scene (in the fifties, I think). Two
established poets wrote a group of poems, ostensibly by an unknown
experimental
poet 'Ern Malley'. Their intention was to expose what they saw as the
pretensions of such poetry.
Re: official verse culture - a matter of circumstance - most of the
magazines here are dominated by it. As are readings, festivals, competitions
etc. but I'm perhaps most keenly aware of it at work - I teach high school
and, whilst university courses are more adventurous, the school curriculum
is extremely limited. From memory, the most experimental writing a high
school student is likely to encounter (and only if studying at the most
advanced level) is A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and T.S. Eliot.
No further comment. Except to say, I understand official verse culture to be
a strand in official culture and, though one may evade some of its
manifestations, it's impossible to evade them all.
In conclusion, a beginning - please dispute some or all of the above - it
just scratches the surface -

*(Digression - there's an account of Henry James meeting Ada Leverson and,
after some discussion of his work prompted by her questions, he said - "Can
it be - it must be - that you are that embodiment of the incorporeal, that
elusive yet ineluctable being to whom through the generations novelists have
so unfailingly made invocation; in short, the Gentle Reader?")

We are greatly heartened by the number of responses to our invitation, but a
little surprised by the number who ask about size... & this morning's epost
has brought another small flood

We said: "The size should be in the proportion 210 (wide) : 297 (high)."

Those figures are the gross metric dimensions of A4, but any (sensible) page
size in that proportion is acceptable. It is likely that the actual
published page size will be less than A4 so make sure that you use a type
size which will cope with reduction!

The important word here is "proportion"

Apologies to those who are not interested in this project...

I appreciated Jorge's culture/Culture offering.  In my mind, I categorize
the recent subjects of class discussion the following way:

These are the things that are given: (what we are)
Mind
Sex
Race
Language

These are the things we produce as a society: (how we live)
Assets
Income
Power
Prestige

These are the creative judgements: (why we live)
religion
culture
Culture


It seems to me that, today, a person might less likely be concerned with
the what and the why, except as they impinge on the how.  And, in this
circular reasoning, because the how is the key to current personal
lifestyles, factors that inhibit choice (what, why) take on a greater
magnitude.  The what and why of who we are motivate the development of what
we might call "alternatives", the fleshing out, so to speak, of the how.

I throw out a Thai example:

Vilak, male, Muang poet (what).  Born into a farming family (how)in
northern Thailand.  Goes to school to discover that he is must learn to
speak and read a second language, Central (Modern) Thai, in order to obtain
an education (why).

From a young age he writes in his mother tongue, a language not taught in
school.  He receives a scholarship to pursue his formal studies in
Thai(how).  He translates his poetry into Central Thai.  He becomes a
well-known Thai poet; most people don't realize they are reading
translation.  He is nominated for the National Book award.  His reads his
work in the original at northern Thai cultural or religious events.

(Vilak's language, Kham Muang (the language of the T'ai Yuan), is currently
 spoken by six million people in northern Thailand.  It is related to, but
not a dialect of modern Thai, having it's own distinctive orthography and
literature.  In the interests of nation building, the Ministry of Education
eliminated the language from the schools (following the incorporation of
the northern Kingdom of Chiang Mai into the Kingdom of Siam).  For several
generations it has been taught in the temples only for the purpose of
reading religious texts.  However, since most men spend time in that
context, some have retained a basic literacy in Kham Muang.)

"One of the most intriguing works is Peter Bisseger's reconstruction of
Kurt Schwitter's Merzbau that visitors can enter. Different expressions of
memory are found in Arnold Dreyblatt's "From the Archives," where 10,000
names and identities taken from the 1933 volume "Whos Who  in Central and
Eastern Europe" are continuously projected onto a transparent circular
screen."

I excerpt part of paragraph because of the Schwitters but also because I am
especially interested in calling attention to the  great work of the
American composer and interactive multimedia artist Arnold Dreyblatt--just
in case any of you are in Berlin before closing date.

michael davidson has a few essays on masculinity and coterie, mostly of the
SF renaissance (spicer, duncan et al) and i imagine he deals with it fairly
extensively in his forthcoming Guys Like Us, about Cold War masculinities.
also, susan suleiman has a book on gender, misogyny and avant garde dealing
w/ the french scene (man ray, surrealists, etc).  rachel blau du plessis
gave a talk on olson, wieners and gender at the poets of the 50s conference
in Maine 1996.  there is much to be written about here, but everytime folks
bring it up on poetix, there's a kind of hysterical  backlash as if icons
were being personally attacked.  for example, if i direct you to Tom
Clarke's biography of Olson, called something like Allegory of a Poet's
Life, i'm sure someone will leap in and denounce it.   i have no feeling
pro or con about tom clarke, but i learned a lot from reading the book (i
inherited the project of reading it for a press that was considering
reprinting it in paperback from someone who'd turned the project down cuz
didn't want to get involved in the "controversy."  this was before i knew
there was a controversy.)  anyway, avantgarde machismo is a much observed
but little written about fact of life.  it's like hettie jones sez of beat
culture.  "so we were somewhat oppressed and it wasn't a perfectly utopian
counterculture; it was better than death in the suburbs."

There's really only one that you really need to deal with: MicroSoft.

Before MicroSoft, Seattle was in a bad way. The expression went, "Will
the last person to leave Seattle please turn out the lights." That's
when Boeing was having troubles and Seattle was becoming a ghost town. Now
because of Bill Gates, Seattle has returned to its former glory, in fact
is stronger than ever. Also, Mr. Gates is very pro-WTO. He has some kind
of role in the organization (sit on a board of some kind, I suspect others
know more than me about this). Certainly it was Mr. Gates who made sure it
was Seattle where the conference was held, and the civil servants in
Seattle ask Mr. Gates how high and how often if he even looks like he
wants somebody to jump.

So as I type this using Windows and as I read the list using Internet
Explorer, I have to ask, just how do you really propose boycotting Seattle
businesses? Every other business besides MicroSoft in Seattle is far less
culpable, so I would have to agree that boycotting all of them but using
Windows and other such products out of necessity is basically harming the
innocent and letting the culprit go free.

Therefore I think some other response is more appropriate. How about a
letter writing campaign to Bill Gates? How about guerilla poetry? What do
the Seattlans think?

About the brilliant Nuyorican poet and performance worker EDWIN TORRES a
writer for New York Magazine wrote, "It's hard to wrestle meaning from the
shreds of language he tosses out. And on paper, Torres seems to make as
much sense as a Port Authority schizophrenic." "It is obvious that Edwin
Torres is the bastard love child of Mayakovsky and Parra, midwifed by
Apollinaire," writes Christian Haye in The Poetry Project Newsletter.
Torres reads at the Poetry Project, Dixon Place, P.S. 122 and the
Performing Garage. Recently, he represented New York City in the National
Poetry Slam in Boston. He won the Nuyorican Poets Cafe's First Annual
Prize for Fresh Poetry. New York Press pronounced him Best Performing Poet
this year saying: "His bent for soul bending language play is without
equal." Ethan Petitt of Nose Magazine says "instead of sounding things',
he 'things' sounds, so that words and meanings go ka-plunk like soft
percussion." Some of his widely diverse influences include Wallace
Stevens, Mayakovsky, Duchamp, Dada, Fluxus, and even Butoh.  Torres' books
include _I Hear Things People Haven't Really Said_ and _Lung Poetry_, and
new from Subpress, _Fractured Humorous_.

Small Press Traffic Reading
Friday, December 10, 7:30 p.m.
Michael Palmer
Hung Q. Tu

Michael Palmer's name is known all over the world, a metonym for the
allusive, lyric, and speculative poetry that he has been writing since the
mid-sixties.  Michael Palmer is the author of several books of poetry and
translations including The Lion Bridge (Selected Poems 1972-1995), (New
Directions, 1998), The Danish Notebook, (Avec Books, 1999), and forthcoming
in Spring 2000 The Promises of Glass from New Directions.  Palmer is the
sage of the unknown, the unverifiable, the poet who promises nothing,
withholds less.  He asks us not what comes between poetry and its audience,
but what poetry reaches toward.  In his extension of modernism, and the
weary beauties of his life work, what goes toward has yet to spring back,
the feelers are out there still, unrelenting tentacles of the
proprioceptive.


Hung Q. Tu was born in Vietnam and raised in San Diego.  His first book, A
Great Ravine, was published by Parenthesis Writing Series and a second,
Verisimilitude, is forthcoming through Atelos Press.  He received a BA in
Literature from UC San Diego, and an MFA in Creative Writing from San
Francisco State University.  Recent work can be found in such journals as
Poetics Journal and Crayon.  He is a co-editor of Krupskaya.  His writing
is dizzy, almost crazy, at the juncture of a number of language practices
and social and cultural signposts.  In the work of Hung Q. Tu, a fever
state of waking and noticing makes mincemeat out of fugue state, tabloid
headlines out of headless tap shoes.  Under the control of the beast, the
world spins, and Hung Q. Tu hangs on by the fingertips, getting bigger than
the beast, the world, the nails steely and invitational.

Reviews of Carl Phillips, Edwin Torres, Jorie Graham, Marilyn Hacker,
Les Murray, Patricia Goedicke, Eric Pankey, Reginald Shepherd, Joel
Kuszai (editor of POETICS@), and also this, about my book HOTEL
IMPERIUM:

"Pop and politics haven't had their hats handed to them in this Popean a
manner in ages.  Reminiscent of the acute fantasias of Susan Wheeler and
Elaine Equi, though temperamentally closer to Connie Deanovich, Loden's
poems talk about what people are (or have been) talking about, but with
barbs hilariously sharpened.  Targets include: most of the recent
Republican presidents (mercifully, she exempts Ford), beauty culture,
Woody Allen, Alan Greenspan, Dan Rather, and insurance companies.  'For
an eye, not an eye./ For a tooth, forget it,' she writes in 'Memo from
the Benefits Department.'  Poetry consumers will find special interest
in language/system queries like 'DCEASE', a surprisingly moving
meditation that begins, 'There are two Elvis Presleys in the Social
Security Death Master File (DCEASE).  The King's social security number
is 409-52-2002.'  And language enthusiasts will approve of 'Last W&T',
a rearrangement, refrigerator-poetry-magnet style, of the words of
Richard Nixon's will.  The danger that cynicism will overtake the
indignation that propels these poems is averted by the joy, bafflement
and innocence of her poems that take icons as incidental examples, not
front-and-center subjects.   Take 'The Little Richard Story': 'On a day
like this,/ without the music/ of appearances, creatures/ could land and
you/ would not be able to explain/ anything to them, not/ the fearless
industry/ of beavers, or why dust bunnies/ prefer the dark, not even/
how Little Richard/ himself came into being.' . . . Loden's first full
collection marches smartly down the path of satire."

FYI, poetry lovers . . .

Hello -- I'm finally back on the list after misadventures in relocation.
These days, I think it's more expensive to go to a hockey game than the
symphony -- and what does that say?
(> What about culture? Are you talking Culture (would you rather
> go to the
> philharmonic or the hockey game?)
(I'd like to go to both, please)

But what I really wanted to mention, re. class, is an Argentinian/Canadian
film, The Dark Side of the Heart, whose main character is a poet who wanders
the streets, reciting lines of poetry and asking for handouts. Also writes
love poems in exchange for steaks at the local grill. "Death" (his frequent
companion) is always trying to find him a "real" job. Has anyone else seen
this film?

Why do we venerate self-published works when their authors are dead, yet
only feel like "real" poets when someone else publishes us? What does it
mean to "be a poet." (I vote w/Ted Berrigan, a poet is someone who makes
poems -- but then, what is a poem? (something a poet makes?))

The preceding message may serve as a reminder to subscribers
that, when forwarding petitions or news, it may be wise to:

1. Check for a date - many 'news' items and especially many
   petitions continue to circulate through the web for years
   at a time;

2. Verify with those concerned - if the item mentions a person
   or organization, contact the party in question or check to
   see whether they have a web site that may address the issue
   as current;

3. Verify using other sources - cross-check the item with its
   source (e.g., the news organ in which it was originally
   published) or with other sources.

In general, one should be very suspicious of items received
by email that cite no date, originary source, or source by
which to obtain further information.

oh louis this is so touchingly urgent and beseeching that, though i don't
know lisa robertson's address and won't bother to look it up since you can
do so yourself, i will be troubled and haunted by your plaintive tone and
send good vibes out there that you and lisa robertson will, no, MUST,

apropos this debacle, did anyone see in the paper that the supreme court is
going to hear a case challenging  the consitutional necessity of the
Miranda Laws????what next???this seems as mindbogglingly cynical as their
decision, about 7-10 years ago, to no longer hear capital punishment
appeals because they were "too costly."

thanks to all
for "first american poem" response.I think the list works best for me
when
there is this dialogue. and
thinking of Robert Duncan and his
"poetics of co-response" he talked of
--this--is so important to me.
so: then: reading  "Our Town" , thinking of Williams
and the particular--and Oppen (Beautiful Particulars, also)
--what do you think of a poetics of the local (olson?)
that has the inter-net as place?

per this conversation regarding
an anthology of poetics from this space.

What happens to place
when place is
all over?

Alan,

When I was on this list several years ago my attempts at getting the list to
be aware of the intricacies and nominalizations of this form were met with
curses and eventually the boot was given to my skinny ass.

What was considered taboo at that time; the posting of imagined
conversations and telephone numbers between two distracted and desperate
lovers was met with active hostility.  In fact the only member who found my
work to be of interest was Christopher Funkhouser.  It is refreshing (even
scary) and endlessly fascinating to see now that home numbers, addresses,
emails, etc. are bandied about in quite a free manner.  It seems that the
point(s) I was trying to explore have now been nominalized within the
context of the group.

It's so interesting to me, one of my perennial interests I guess, how the
dynamics of listservs are effected by the simple reply-to function of the
majordomo.  I was cheered, nee amused, when I went to respond to this recent
posting of yours and I found myself responding to the group.

I received a recent post <backchannel> from a member who expressed a disdain
for the dynamics for the list as it seems to this person that the list
serves as more of bulletin board for future (unattainable) events than as a
real discussion space for poetics.  My take on this is that this space is
not for discussion but is rather a living(?) laboratory for the exploration
of these small and terribly important issues such as the bots talk in your
piece.  And of course it also serves as an archive of these items. Most of
the time I could care less whether there is an interesting discussion going
on as, for me it serves as a wonderful place to dump texts which I want to
be able to find again, reconstruct again, deconstruct again in 50 years.

The point behind all of this and my letter is to express my appreciation for
your work.  Of all the comments and work I have seen posted here since I
rejoined you seem really to be grappling with the issues which this medium
creates/compounds/ignores.  The growth in your work and the maturity that I
see in works like "Re: The Work of Authority in IRC Channel #Nikuko" are
breathtaking to behold and I am so pleased that I could rejoin and see this
in comparison to the work of yours I saw before (several years ago) which
did not seem to be effected at all by the medium.

So a hearty "Bravo!" to you sir and a round of ale for all in the house.

Greetings.  We've recently seen a tirade of stories about "hidden"
identification codes and what many would consider to be surreptitious
centralized information flowing from various popular Internet products and
packages.  These have tended to highlight an important truth--whether or not
users really would be concerned about the particular identifiers or data
involved, they tend to get the most upset when they feel that an effort was
made to perform such functions "behind their backs."  While it can be argued
how routine, intrusive, or even mundane and innocent a particular case may
be, it's certainly true that people feel a lot better when they know what's
going on.

This issue isn't restricted only to the Internet world.  A case in point--
the recurring rumors floating around regarding the presence or absence of
identification codes in color copies (or color prints xerographically
generated from computer output systems).

A recent story involved a customer who was refused permission to make a
color copy of his driver's license (to deal with an identification problem
with his local telephone company).  A Kinko's (copying center) worker
reportedly told him that such a copy was "illegal," and could be traced back
to the store through a "hidden ID."

Regardless of whether or not the Kinko's employee was being overzealous in
his interpretation of the rules, what's really going on here regarding a
so-called hidden ID code?

In fact, rumors about this, often chalked up as an "urban legend," have been
circulating for a long time.  This is a bit ironic, given that in the
copier/printer industry it's been well known for years--no secret--that
"invisible" IDs *are* imprinted on virtually all color xerographic output,
from (apparently) all of the manufacturers.  But for persons outside of
"the trade," this hasn't been as widely known (even though the issue goes
back to the early 90's, and the topic has appeared in publications such as
the Wall Street Journal).  However, it does not appear that the
privacy-related aspects of this technology have ever been subject to
significant public discussion.

In an effort to pin down the current state of the art in this area, I had a
long and pleasant chat with one of Xerox's anti-counterfeiting experts, who
is the technical product manager for several of their color-copying
products.  The conversation was quite illuminating.  Please note that the
details apply only to Xerox products, though we can safely assume similar
systems from competing manufacturers, although their specific policies may
differ.

Years ago, when the potential for counterfeiting of valuable documents on
color copiers/xerographic printers became apparent in Japan (where such
machines first appeared) manufacturers were concerned about negative
governmental reaction to such technology.  In an effort to stave off
legislative efforts to restrict such devices, various ID systems began being
implemented at that point.  At one stage for at least one U.S.
manufacturer, this was as crude as a serial number etched on the underside
of the imaging area glass!

Modern systems, which are now reportedly implemented universally, use much
more sophisticated methods, encoding the ID effectively as "noise"
repeatedly throughout the image, making it impossible to circumvent the
system through copying or printing over a small portion of the image area,
or by cutting off portions of printed documents.  Effectively, I'd term this
as sort of the printing equivalent of "spread spectrum" in radio technology.

To read these IDs, the document in question is scanned and the "noise"
decoded via a secret and proprietary algorithm.  In the case of
Xerox-manufactured equipment, only Xerox has the means to do this, and they
require a court order to do so (except for some specific government
agencies, for whom they no longer require court authorizations).  I'm told
that the number of requests Xerox receives for this service is on the order
of a couple a week from within the U.S.

The ID is encoded in all color copies/prints from the Xerox color
copier/printer line.  It does not appear in black and white copies.  The
technology has continued to evolve, and it is possible that it might be
implemented within other printing technologies as well (e.g. inkjet).  At
one time there were efforts made to also include date/time stamps within the
encoded data, but these were dropped by Xerox (at least for now) due to
inconsistencies such as the printer clocks not being set properly by their
operators, rendering their value questionable.

It's interesting to note that these machines also include other
anti-counterfeiting measures, such as dumping extra cyan toner onto images
when the unit believes it has detected an attempt to specifically copy
currency.  These techniques have all apparently been fairly successful--the
Secret Service has reported something on the order of a 30% drop in color
copying counterfeiting attempts since word of such measures has been
circulating in the industry.  The average person might wonder who the blazes
would ever accept a xerographic copy of money in any case... but apparently
many persons are not very discerning.  I'm told that the Secret Service has
examples in their files of counterfeit currency successfully passed that was
printed on *dot matrix* printers.  So counterfeiting is certainly a genuine
problem.

OK, so now you know--the IDs are there.  The next question is, what does
this really mean?  Obviously the vast majority of uses for color copies are
completely innocuous or even directly beneficial to the public good (e.g.
whistleblowers attempting to expose a fraud against the public).  Is it
acceptable for an ID to be embedded in all color copies just to catch those
cases?  The answer seems to be, it depends.

In some cases, even having an ID number doesn't necessarily tell you who
currently owns the machine.  While some countries (e.g. China) do keep tight
reign on the ownership and transfer of such equipment, there is no
"registration" requirement for such devices in the U.S. (though the routine
servicing realities of large units might well create something of a de-facto
registration in many situations).

Xerox points out that non-color copies (at least on their machines) have no
IDs, and that most copying applications don't need color.  It is however also
true that as the prices of color copiers and printers continue to fall, it
seems only a matter of time before they become the "standard" even for home
copying, at which time the presence of IDs could cover a much vaster range
of documents and become increasingly significant from a routine privacy
standpoint.

It's also the case that we need to be watchful for the "spread" of this
technology, intended for one purpose, into other areas or broader
applications (what I call "technology creep").  We've seen this effect
repeatedly with other technologies over the years, from automated toll
collection to cell phone location tracking.  While there is currently no U.S.
legislative requirement that manufacturers of copier technology include IDs
on color copies, it is also the case that these manufacturers have the clear
impression that if they do not include such IDs, legislation to require them
would be immediately forthcoming.

It is important to be vigilant to avoid such perceived or real pressures
from causing possibly intrusive technology creep in this area.  In the
copier case, that ID technology being used for color copies *could* be
adapted to black and white copies and prints as well.  The addition of
cheap GPS units to copiers could provide not only valid date/time stamps,
but also the physical *locations* of the units, all of which could be
invisibly encoded within the printed images.

Pressures to extend the surveillance of commercial copyright enforcement
take such concepts out of the realm of science-fiction, and into the range of
actual future possibilities.  What many would consider to be currently
acceptable anti-counterfeiting technology could be easily extended into the
realm of serious privacy invasions.  It would only require,
as Dr. Strangelove once said, "The will to do so."

Perhaps the most important point is that unless we as a society actively
stay aware of these technologies, however laudable their initial
applications may often be, we will be unable to participate in the debate
that is crucial to determining their future evolution.  And it's in the
vacuum of technology evolving without meaningful input from society that the
most serious abuses, be they related to the Internet or that copy machine
over on your desk, are the most likely to occur.

Dear Dodie Blah,

Yes. Is there something wrong with that? Dismissiveness can be a byproduct
of judgment, which in turn is often necessary for the writing of poetry.
Although you were kind enough to send your post to the list instead of
needling me by backchannel, I sense a certain amount of dismissiveness in
your own response.

Luigi,

What I suggest is not so much to <make a book of on-line work> as to
present an alternative to the
_Best American Poetry_ series, or a parody or a spoof or, again, a
serious experimental alternative to that text, replete with its
conservative-skewed poetries.

Is the effort to validate on-line poetries?  Sort of, yes.  Though why
not, if only for kicks, and/or tricks, get more experimental poetry into
mainstream bookstores.  Why not play the same games and open up the
playing fields (to kids, patrons...) in as many new ways as one can
imagine?

Make it a more marketable commodity?  No, I don't think I'm suggesting
<more marketable> or <more commodity>.  I am suggesting that the world's
not as black and white as it used to be.  If Barnes and Noble and
Borders suddenly noticed 5-10 years from now that they were stocking
experimental poetries they'd never have conceived of stocking by
themselves, if it suddenly dawned on them that somehow they'd been
unwittingly turned into a bit of a library and that in fact it wasn't
even doing them any harm, and if some <fun> and <pranks> added a few new
twists to the existing macrofabrics of accessibility, what harm?  It's
kind of like having the power to hack against militarism--do ya do it or
do ya resist risking crossing into <cracker-dom>?

It was like this:  I was reading one of the Best American Poetry
issues.  A handful of experimental poets, 85 percent mainstream.  An
experimental mag here or there, _APR_, and the various _Reviews_ and
other sad mags making up the bulk.  I laughed to myself, What if So-n-So
or So-n-So from our side of the tracks had been the editors, and what if
the bulk of mags/journals represented had been experimental mags?  Ah,
but that couldn't happen; this is a Barnes and Noble and this is Best
American Poetry.  Or wait a minute... Call it _Blah Blah Blah On-line_
(never even intending to restrict it to American, for that matter),
borrow their infrastructure, and launch what the average B&N patron
(or regional buyer) would never even realize reflected an entirely
different agenda?  To compete with
Best American Poetry?  No, not really, exactly, maybe...  Rather,
cooperating...

Arbitrating what is the Best?  No, not that at all, as it is indeed, I
agree, an undesirable.  Rather, <Best>, like <American>, is largely a
ruse, another fun trick or game.  Trying to WIN?  No, no, no.
Please don't misunderstand me.

I, too, imbue these answers to your good and gentle questions with more
intensity than I like.  And I wish none of that on you, old chap, always
one I've much respected.  I do, though, want to make clear the
essentially mischievous nature of my note.  It's probably, in fact, more
a satirical slant on BAP and what's available in mainstream
stores/colleges etcetera than a serious plan of action.  Though, smile,
I think it would be hilarious to see a chance-operationally-selected
experimental journal or two in big, naive stores.

Bests, Steve

A tiny voice of caution here - too many people doing this, might well just add
to the general chaos. Don't forget, people will be bunging up the network with
all kinds of nonsense at this time as well - you know, multi-media emails
sending millenium messages , christmas messages, all sorts of real-time hook-ups
using webcams etc etc. There might well be other institutions/bodies who have
similar ideas as this. The more I write, the more I think that the net will
grind to a standstill - and not because of Y2K problems, either. In engineering
terms, this is called stress-testing.

#
#  Hi - I'm asking everyone to participate in the TRACEROUTE PROJECT, which
#  really occurs on December 31 and January 1. Traceroute is a utility which
#  comes with the unix or linux operating system - there is a version in
#  Win95 and Win98 called tracert. It is a way to track the path from your
#  computer to a site anywhere in the world. For example, if you are in
#  Australia, at Murdoch University, you could type
#
#  tracert columbia.edu
#
#  at the DOS prompt in Windows 95 0r 98, and you would have a chart of the
#  route between Murdoch and Columbia University in New York, USA.
#
#  Traceroute or tracert works by looking at the route between your computer
#  and your target address, and sending signals to every machine between the
#  two - three signals (usually) per machine. The machines then send return
#  signals, and traceroute gives you the round-trip time for each of the
#  three.
#
#  Traceroute is used by system administrators and people like me to look at
#  the "health" of the Internet as a whole - it tells you which machines
#  aren't responding, for example (those which send back asterix such as *).
#  It's incredibly useful.
#
#  Between December 31 and January 1, almost all the Y2k problems on the Net
#  will be visible thorugh traceroute. The idea of this project is to gather
#  a huge sheaf of data, illustrating the world-wide state of the Internet as
#  the millennium starts. (The millennium takes a day to start world-wide,
#  because of the time zones.)
#
#  What I would like from participants is a group of traceroutes sent to
#  Trace (we'll let you know where), accompanied by your name.  There is some
#  technical information below (taken from a few posts I made) that indicates
#  how to do this. It would also be great if you could include a description
#  of Y2k problems in your location - for example, subways out, flickering
#  lights, and so forth - and give your location as well. All of this will be
#  included in the final report.
#
#  None of this will be graphic or great looking - but it will be an amazing
#  compendium of the state of the earth at a critical time for humanity...
#
#  Please participate! Please post questions here!
#
#  Alan - and thank you!
#
#  (Below is the information from the other posts - you can ignore this if it
#  is too technical.)
#
#  I would like to start, almost immediately, thinking about doing TRACEROUTE
#  (traceroute) commands in linux or unix across the millennial hinge (i.e.
#  during the day the time shifts over), reporting back on speed etc. between
#  nodes etc. as the millennium arrives and Y2k does or does not come to
#  fruition. Please let me know if you are interested in participating - you
#  would have to have access to some traceroute program, and the ability to
#  convert the results to a text file; we'll try and establish a site for
#  placing these...
#

#  And here is additional information. If you are on Windows 95 or 98, and

#  utilities available):
#
#
#  Some tools for using with the Traceroute Project for Windows (tested for
#  Win98):
#
#
#  PING:
#
#  Usage: ping [-t] [-a] [-n count] [-l size] [-f] [-i TTL] [-v TOS]
#  [-r count] [-s count] [[-j host-list] | [-k host-list]]
#  [-w timeout] destination-list
#
#  Options:
#  -t Ping the specifed host until stopped.
#  To see statistics and continue - type Control-Break;
#  To stop - type Control-C.
#  -a Resolve addresses to hostnames.
#  -n count Number of echo requests to send.
#  -l size Send buffer size.
#  -f Set Don't Fragment flag in packet.
#  -i TTL Time To Live.
#  -v TOS Type Of Service.
#  -r count Record route for count hops.
#  -s count Timestamp for count hops.
#  -j host-list Loose source route along host-list.
#  -k host-list Strict source route along host-list.
#  -w timeout Timeout in milliseconds to wait for each reply.
#
#
#  TRACERT (traceroute):
#
#  Usage: tracert [-d] [-h maximum_hops] [-j host-list] [-w timeout]
#  target_name
#
#  Options:
#  -d Do not resolve addresses to hostnames.
#  -h maximum_hops Maximum number of hops to search for target.
#  -j host-list Loose source route along host-list.
#  -w timeout Wait timeout milliseconds for each reply.
#
#  NETSTAT:
#
#  Active Connections
#
#  Proto Local Address Foreign Address State
#
#
#  Netstat tells you the Network statistics; both tracert and ping are very
#  configurable. As you may know, you can also do ftp and telnet from the
#  prompt.
#
#  If you do, say, tracert to panix.com, you would do tracert panix.com >
#  trace.txt for example - which places the output in trace.txt. You may have
#  to go back in and add the command "tracert panix.com" to the top of the
#  file. If you then want to do, say, tracert trace.ntu.ac.uk and put it in
#  trace.txt next, you would do tracert trace.ntu.ac.uk >> trace.txt The
#  double carets >> mean "add to" and not "replace" - otherwise the trace.txt
#  will be replaced. The same goes for ping or other commands.
#
#  This way, you can build up a file of traceroutes to send on - configured
#  as you see fit. You might also use ping at times.

although i don't consider myself part of the "whiteness studies" bunch, i'm
currently working on a study of articulations of whiteness in mid-century poetics,
esp. in New Criticism and postwar cosmopolitanism--i've got a ways to go on this,
so any suggestions out there would be most appreciated--

in the main, though, Aldon's right about the lack of any attention to
poetry/poetics in the current interrogations of whiteness--what gives on this?  if
anyone on the list knows of work being done in this area, please post--

It's almost impossible not to use Windows -- tho I hear there's to be a
similar operating system available free- or share-ware soon. BUT one can try
not to BUY microsoft products, even if one uses them.

A boycott of corporations would be much more to the point than a boycott of
Seattle businesses. If you're not already avoiding the biggies (Starbuck,
Barnes & Noble, etc.), shame on you. And don't forget to bring your own cup.

I had heard of no such thing myself.  Maria, would you mind passing along

apropos this debacle, did anyone see in the paper that the supreme court is
going to hear a case challenging  the consitutional necessity of the

decision, about 7-10 years ago, to no longer hear capital punishment
appeals because they were "too costly."

Chosen with care <Links and Books> (but not only)

Updated version of the site KARENINA.IT

karenina.IT is a meeting virtual place, and a site for debate between
critics, theories, artists, cultural operators, which realises a map of
Italian and international research.

Karenina.it promotes publications, events and relevant initiatives about not
commercial experimental projects.

In our pages "Chosen With Care" you are going to find: critical reports,
releases, links and information about electronic art, art in the Internet,
experimental literature, performative and visual poetry, multimedia,
articles about exhibitions, meetings and festivals, editorial news and more.

The site realisation (by Caterina Davinio davinio@tin.it) presents
hypertext-visual incursions, which bring in the net and combine with
telematic communication some techniques typical of the visual poetry.
"Karenina.IT" utilises textual and not-textual objects found in the
Internet, digital ready made and fragments of virtual reality; in Karenina
the acquisition and the transit of the information is act of the performance
and net-art opera structure.

"karenina.IT" co-operates with "Testuale", Italian literary critic review,
and has opened a section called "Imaginary Codes" dedicated to
techno-cultures, visions and theories of the Net, in which the same titled
fanzine from Rome is published.

All the persons interested in our project are asked to diffuse this
communication and the site address. English in not our mother language. Who
finds some mistakes is asked to send to us a correct version of the texts.
People who can translate "karenina.it" Italian pages into English or who can
contribute with reports in Italian, English, Spanish or French are welcome!

Karenina.it is an open project. Among the numerous co-operators we remember:

Mirella Bentivoglio (visual poetry), Tomaso Binga, Paolo Guzzi, Massimo Mori
(visual, performative and sonore poetry), Antonio Caronia (horror and
science fiction literature), Caterina Davinio (electronic writings and arts,
videopoetry, literature), Gio Ferri (literary criticism, multimedia), Paolo
Ferri (hypertext theory), Marco Maria Gazzano (electronic art, video art),
Marco Minicangeli (noir literature), Francesco Muzzioli (literary
criticism), Clemente Padin, Philadepho Menezes (experimental poetry),
Roberto Terrosi (philosophy & the arts), Tommaso Trini (arts), Nando Vitale
(imaginary codes).

With regard to the Miranda ruling, the most recent news
of which I'm aware is what follows: a February case held
in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Likely as not,
this is moving forward to the Supreme Court now.

Dismay is not inappropriate, perhaps, but also hinges on
the belief that you've always had "the right to remain
silent" or that any such right is worth the paper it is
written on; I don't suppose, for example, that Miranda
was of much use to Abner Louima. An extreme example,
perhaps, but there are innumerable cases on record of
suspects' rights being infringed upon in varying degrees -
from hours-long delays in reading the prepared statement
associated with the Miranda ruling to outright violence;
In general, I would say there is a strong relationship
between race and class on the one hand and protection
under the law on the other. It may also be worth mention-
ing that the U.S. Justice Department has never employed
Miranda, having considered the ruling to apply only to
state and local police.

This is not to say that Miranda should be over-ruled -
and "conservative" groups such as the National Center
for Policy Analysis have fought for years to have it
done away with - but rather that the degree of protection
it actually provides, and to whom, is a questionable
matter indeed.

A series of articles by Jan Hoffman, published in The
New York Times, may be of interest on this count:

# Some Officers Are Skirting Miranda Restraints to Get
# Confessions (March 29) - Pointing out how the bright
# line rule has been so weakened by exceptions and
# workarounds that it no longer has significant meaning.

# When Warning Is Little More Than a Speed Bump (March 29)
# - Portions of a law enforcement training video on the how
# ignoring Miranda has negligible effect on a prosecution.

# As Miranda Rights Erode, Police Get Confessions From
# Innocent People (March 30) - The how and the why of false
# confessions, and why they're so easy when the principles
# of fairness inherent in Miranda are ignored.

Of further interest may be this article by Special Agent
Kimberly A. Crawford of the FBI Academy, in which she reviews
restrictions placed by courts on the use of Miranda, and gives
suggestions as to how these restrictions can be used by law
enforcement agencies to work around the ruling which, she
asserts, "has such an onerous impact on law enforcement's
ability to conduct interrogations."

In a surprise ruling, a U.S. Court of Appeals has
decided that the famous "Miranda warnings," required
of police as a precursor to admissible confessions by
the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1966 case of Miranda v.
Arizona, were actually made optional in federal court
by a federal statute passed into law in 1968.

The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 panel
decision last week in U.S. v. Dickerson, ignored the
Justice Department's stated policy position to the
effect that the statute is unconstitutional under
Miranda and subsequent cases. In spite of a complete
lack of briefing or argument by the parties, the court
chose to take the lead suggested by an amicus (friend
of the court) brief, to bring an issue debated in
academia to real life.

The majority of the panel found that Miranda is not
really based in the constitution, and that as such,
it can be and was overruled by the 1968 federal law,
which discusses the admissibility of confessions in
federal courts.

OPINION
Circuit Judge Williams

In response to the Supreme Court's decision
in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966),
the Congress of the United States enacted 18
U.S.C.A. =A7 3501 (West 1985), with the clear
intent of restoring voluntariness as the test
for admitting confessions in federal court.

Although duly enacted by the United States Congress
and signed into law by the President of the United
States, the United States Department of Justice has
steadfastly refused to enforce the provision. In fact,
after initially "taking the Fifth" on the statute's
constitutionality, the Department of Justice has now
asserted, without explanation, that the provision
is unconstitutional. With the issue squarely
presented, we hold that Congress, pursuant to its
power to establish the rules of evidence and
procedure in the federal courts, acted well within
its authority in enacting =A7 3501. As a consequence,
=A7 3501, rather than Miranda, governs the
admissibility of confessions in federal court.
Accordingly, the district court erred in suppressing
Dickerson's voluntary confession on the grounds that
it was obtained in technical violation of Miranda.

I did manage to find one more recent article;
this from New York Law Journal for 7 December:

"The Justices [have] agreed to decide whether
a federal law overturned =8B or at least dramatically
limited =8B one of the Court's most famous decisions,
one that since 1966 has required police to warn
criminal suspects of their rights before questioning
them.
     To be decided by late June in Dickerson v.

statements a Maryland man made to FBI agents should
be used as evidence in his bank robbery trial even
though he may not have received a proper Miranda
warning."

 what follows is from the Dallas Morning News regarding the Supreme Court=20
review of the constitutional requirement for Miranda rights......


Supreme Court will review landmark Miranda ruling=20
Little-used law says warning to suspects not always needed

12/07/99

By David Jackson / The Dallas Morning News

WASHINGTON - When Arizona police obtained a confession from Ernesto Miranda=20
in 1963, the Supreme Court responded with one of its most famous edicts:=20
Police must tell suspects they have the right to remain silent and retain a=20
lawyer.


THE MIRANDA WARNING=20
Since 1966, police nationwide have carried small cards with the warnings tha=
t=20
criminal suspects are entitled to receive before being questioned. The=20
wording can vary slightly. Here is a typical version:=20
 =E2=80=A2 You have the right to remain silent.=20
 =E2=80=A2 Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.=20
 =E2=80=A2 You have the right to the presence of an attorney to assist you p=
rior to=20
questioning and to be with you during questioning if you so desire.=20
=E2=80=A2  If you cannot afford an attorney, you have the right to have an a=
ttorney=20
appointed for you prior to the questioning.=20
 =E2=80=A2 Do you understand these rights?=20
SOURCE: Associated Press
=20
Now the high court is having second thoughts, inspired by a 1997 conversatio=
n=20
between law officers and Maryland resident Charles Dickerson.

The justices agreed Monday to review the landmark Miranda ruling of 1966,=20
setting up a legal battle royal over the rights of police and defendants,=20
especially low-income and ill-educated ones.

"In the most basic sense, what's at stake is how police are required to=20
protect an individual's constitutional rights," said James W. Hundley, a=20
Virginia lawyer who defended Mr. Dickerson against a robbery charge.

A federal judge dismissed Mr. Dickerson's statements about the robbery,=20
saying officers used them to obtain a search warrant before reading him his=20
Miranda rights.

The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Richmond, Va., reinstated th=
e=20
case, citing a little-used congressional law passed in 1968.

That law - which says Miranda warnings are not required if confessions are=20
voluntary - has been the legal weapon of choice for lawyers who call the=20
Miranda ruling "pro-criminal."

"There are tens of thousands of crimes that go unsolved every year because o=
f=20
the Miranda rules," said Paul Cassell, a University of Utah law professor wh=
o=20
has waged a six-year campaign to overturn the Miranda decision.

The Supreme Court invited Mr. Cassell to participate in arguments next year.=
=20
The justices will decide the case sometime before July.

Familiar phrases

Thanks to TV cops like Joe Friday, millions of viewers are familiar with the=
=20
Miranda warning typed onto small cards issued to police officers. Chief=20
Justice Earl Warren supplied the wording in one of his court's most praised=20
and criticized rulings.

The Miranda decision came to symbolize the more liberal approach of the=20
Warren court. In the decades since, the court has grown increasingly=20
conservative, tending to stress police rights over those of defendants.

The case began with the kidnapping and rape of a Phoenix woman on March 2,=20
1963. Eleven days later, police arrested Mr. Miranda, obtaining a confession=
=20
after two hours of private interrogation. A jury convicted him and sentenced=
=20
Mr. Miranda to 20 years.

In appealing to the Supreme Court, defense attorney John Flynn argued that,=20
unlike wealthy or well-connected defendants, an eighth-grade educated=20
indigent like his client had no idea he was entitled to a lawyer.

"He was called upon to surrender a right that he didn't fully realize and=20
appreciate that he had," Mr. Flynn told the high court.

Gary Nelson, an assistant attorney general for Arizona, countered that if=20
police suggested defendants retain lawyers, it would effectively end all=20
interviews.

In writing for a 5-4 majority, Chief Justice Warren stressed the=20
psychological relationship between police and defendants.

He said officers are trained to worm confessions out of people by assuming=20
their guilt, then encouraging them to talk by blaming their problems on=20
society.

"This atmosphere carries its own badge of intimidation," Chief Justice Warre=
n=20
wrote. "To be sure, this is not physical intimidation, but it is equally=20
destructive of human dignity."

Justice White's fears

Dissenting Supreme Court justices accused the majority of exaggerating polic=
e=20
misconduct. They also predicted that the court-crafted Miranda rules would=20
return killers and rapists to the streets.

"As a consequence, there will not be a gain, but a loss, in human dignity,"=20
Justice Byron White wrote.

Mr. Cassell and other critics say Justice White's fears have come to pass. H=
e=20
cited studies suggesting the Miranda rules have gutted cases, either because=
=20
the rules shut off interrogations or because police officers committed=20
technical violations in reading the rights.

Supporters of the Miranda ruling said evidence of failed prosecutions is=20
vastly overstated, and that most police groups support Miranda. They said th=
e=20
rules have forced police and prosecutors to act more professionally and work=
=20
harder to build better cases.

The case that made his name famous did not free Mr. Miranda. Prosecutors wen=
t=20
back to Arizona and convicted him on evidence other than his confession.

Eventually released, Mr. Miranda made pocket money by autographing=20
police-issued Miranda cards before he was stabbed to death in a 1976 bar=20
fight.

Mr. Dickerson's journey to the Supreme Court began on Jan. 27, 1997. FBI=20
agents and Virginia police visited his Maryland home to discuss an $876 bank=
=20
robbery three days earlier in Old Town Alexandria, Va.

Mr. Dickerson first denied any knowledge of the robbery but said he had been=
=20
in the area when it happened. The FBI then obtained a search warrant for his=
=20
home. Apprised of this, Mr. Dickerson told the FBI he had driven to=20
Alexandria with a relative named Jimmy, who had a history of bank robberies.

Court records indicate that officers then gave Mr. Dickerson his Miranda=20
warnings, though the timing is in dispute.

The case forces the Supreme Court to consider not only the responsibilities=20
of police and suspects, but the relationship between Congress and the courts=
.

The more conservative court, led by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, has=20
tended to favor police. But it has also struck down what it perceives as=20
congressional attempts to override court rulings.

Texas case a factor

Two terms ago, in a case involving a Catholic church near San Antonio, the=20
high court slapped down what it called a congressional attempt to overturn a=
=20
key church-state ruling.

If the court applies the same logic in the Dickerson case, supporters of=20
Miranda said the justices have no choice but to strike down the 1968=20
congressional law.

"That was the basis for the [Texas] decision: 'We [the justices] make the=20
constitutional rules, you do not,' " said Steven Shapiro of the American=20
Civil Liberties Union.

In upholding the case against Mr. Dickerson, the appeals court chided the=20
Justice Department for not invoking the 1968 law. In a brief to the Supreme=20
Court, Attorney General Janet Reno argued that Miranda is good law and that=20
Congress lacks the authority to tamper with it.

Critics of Miranda said Chief Justice Warren did not give the warnings the=20
status of constitutional rights. Therefore, they added, Congress and state=20
legislatures have the right to set rules for criminal trials.

The congressional law also does not forbid police from issuing Miranda=20
rulings if they choose to, supporters said. Forced confessions would still b=
e=20
forbidden in court, even if the Miranda decision is overturned.

"I don't think the sky will fall," Mr. Cassell said. "The only thing that=20
will change is that criminals won't go free because of technicalities."

in the main, though, Aldon's right about the lack of any attention to
poetry/poetics in the current interrogations of whiteness--what gives on
this?

************

Michael,

in general, you'll find little attention to poetry on the part of
theorists who deal with identity politics issues;  and indeed, with
cultural politics of any sort...

When attention is given, it is likely to be to formally conservative forms
of writing that can be "interrogated" without talking back too much: that
can be examined as transparent, unproblematic statements or symptoms,
without worrying about all that messy artistic stuff which theorists would
prefer didn't exist.

Thus the importance and excitement attaching to the theorist/critics who
*are* looking at poetry in relation to the broad public space of race and
ethnicity and politics issues....such as listoids Maria and (centrally)
Aldon.....

Katie, why do you protest so vehemently to posts
concerning class and writing? From what position do you
justify your argument that discussions of class are in
fact separate from discussions of "a poem's actual
structure or technique or craft"? What do you deem to be
"other interesting things"?
Your post seems quite reactionary to me and I frankly find
it disturbing. From whence this vehemence to silence
discussions about class "(class/race/gender/blah blah
blah)"? Do I really have to make a choice between being
one or the other, in your words, roles as "writers or
civil rights activists"? What about some of the great
contemporary innovative writing by poets who are *both*?
See, for example, Erica Hunt's Local History. How is it
possible to read someone like Hunt without reading race?
without reading class, or gender?
What kind of world is it that you live in where it is
possible to separate language from politics? from power?
from race? from class? from gender?
You might want to take a look at work being done in
poetics, some of the most excellent by folks on this list.
See, for example, Aldon Nielsen's Black Chant: Languages
of African-American Postmodernism, or the volume edited by
Charles Bernstein: The Politics of Poetic Form.

I agree with this assessment. There's some very
interesting work being done on "whiteness" in the social
sciences, such as John Hartigan Jr.'s enthnographic
studies of poor whites in Detroit and Ruth Frankenberg's
ground-breaking work, but literary criticism lags behind.
I think there is opportunity, and necessity, to fill the
gap. Any suggestions that people have on work that *is*
being done in this area in lit crit, please tell. I'm very
interested in this topic.
Thanks,

Blah blah blah,

"This court is generously swayed.
Lunch break, sure. That eight-hour

to work. Our syllables are
expensive. You are in debt."

        *

...or talk and work, all the same.
Shift by shift the mouth's noise swings
so as to empty out. Talk,
cooked, goes raw. Material
for a monument, polished
to receive inscription, take
dictation: BLAH BLAH BLAH.
Roman caps, human-high.

        *

I was small, the world less so.
Late from work, or early for

largely from small books to me.
Labored, worked over, beat, gassed,
their mouths made many noises.

I can't hear. There is one sound,

I can't hear, but my neighbor

the sorted salvage with one
syllable, the only one
it ever made for us. And
repeat, and then again,
calmer than at first. Second
time's a charm, third time a curse.

------------------------------------------------------------------
...all of which, by way of explaining my sense that Dodie's "blah blah blah"
functions very differently from Katie Degentesh's. It's one thing to point
out satirically (with Dodie) that someone has named themselves as an
accomplice in the ideological administration of culture that wants to reduce
the status of class, race and gender therein to a "blah blah blah." It's
quite another to be such an accomplice, which is the direction in which
Katie's intervention tends.

Yes, poetry can be one way to think the possibility of a world in which
class, race and gender as compulsory narratives of origin are perhaps less
binding, in which "we" make culture with collective regard to craft and
care, rather than (or at least alongside) the overarching question, "Who
benefits?" But it doesn't become such a practice simply by living in denial
of the damaged world it's handed, on and in which it has to do whatever work
it does.

A little report on a reading, but first a request:  I am planning on
writing an essay on Barbara Guest's work, mainly focusing on how it has
influenced the currently emerging experimental women poets.  But I would
love citations or suggestions of critical essays on Guest's work that
anyone is aware of.  Thanks very much.  You can backchannel.

I was in Barbara Guest's master class for poetry this weekend at the 92nd
Street Y, and she was elegant and kind and had astute comments.  I also
attended her subsequent reading on Monday night with Kenneth Koch,
introduced by John Ashbery -- were any of you there?  It was a mostly
older crowd, who seemed a bit baffled by Barbara Guest's work, but also
charmed.  She has a lovely voice and her work is difficult and challenging
in the best ways.  She read mostly from _Rocks on a Platter_.  Kenneth
Koch read from a forthcoming book of "addresses" -- to things, not places
he's lived.  They were funny and full of energy, and so was he.
Interesting to me how differently the two poets have changed over the
years, the very alternate courses their work has taken.  Barbara Guest
seems, despite her apparent distance from "the academic," more and more
interested in "the nature of the text" and her work is very different
than her early stuff...Kenneth Koch in many ways seems to be writing in
much the same vein, though he is dealing a lot with getting older in his
work.

Sorry...brief and shallow comments...I am braindead.  I'm sure I can be
more eloquent and thoughtful if anyone is interested in discussing.

ISIS 2000:
The Goddess in the New Aeon


An Anthology of Goddess Poetry



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--


As part of the Goddess 2000 project, the Temple of Isis Los Angeles is
sponsoring an anthology of goddess-oriented poetry. Poet Denise Dumars will
serve as editor of the project. The anthology will be published in April 2000
and poetry readings will be held in conjunction with other Goddess 2000
events.

Guidelines:


Poems of high literary value are requested. Despite the title of our
anthology, poems need not be about Isis or the Egyptian pantheon. Poetry
about goddesses from all cultures are sought, as well as poems about "found"
goddesses and cultural and mythological heroines.


Please submit poems in the form in which you would like to see them

i guess the most interesting thing abt this potential field of study would
not be, for example, a mere transposition of the insights of "whiteness
studies" onto poetic texts or authors, but an investigation into the
categories of poetry and whiteness themselves and what *special*
relationship, if any, obtained between them.  one might postulate, for
example, on how the New Critics/Southern Agrarians conceived of poetry and
how that conception came to be socially dominant, in connection with the
link (and there was one, very explicitly) between the New Critics and a
possessive investment in whiteness.  One could also think along lines of
specific privileges accorded to whteness and specific assumptions about the
"special" place of poetry in literary discourse, and how this specialness
is used to render non-white poetries invisible *as* poetry (i.e. it can
only serve as sociological evidence, it isn't "good," etc).   certain
*forms* are also associaetd with whiteness, different class statuses and
ethnicites within what is generally called "white," etc.

If the Net grinds to a halt, traceroute would record this; I could see a
lot of broken limbs out there. Surprisingly, since this announcement has
gone the route so to speak, there's been very little indication of
duplication - one site is doing a visual look at the world, but more in

Aldon --

        When talking about the perception of race in poetry, I'm dealing
mainly with "mainstream" public discourse, as opposed to study within the
academy -- I have no familiarity with whiteness studies, and I hope I
didn't claim to. What I'm reporting is more the impression that what the
mainstream media often talk about when they talk about a writer's
socioeconomic status is the writer's race. The way the local poetry
bookstore here, for example, organizes its books is by race.

        Now, to a certain extent this ordering makes sense. But it does
seem clear to me that I would never walk in to a bookstore and find a
shelf "working class poetry", or if I did, I'd know immediately that it
was a conscious decision on the part of the manager rather than an
acceptance of a particular, commonly accepted mode of putting the bricks
in the boxes.

        So what do I mean when I say that class can be used as a blind for
race? To me, the division of poetry and poetic practice by race is "a bad
thing" -- which may play off of some of my assumptions about poetry. Such
as, I believe that experimental poetry is a "sensical term", and that
experiment implies collaboration, and that collaborations are the most
productive and the most interesting when there aren't barriers to entry.

        Given that the division is a bad thing, it seems that it should be
something talked about, or worked with/on, or at least acknoledged by a
group of readers/writers/critics on a self-described avant-garde poetry
list. Saying "the real division is class" often amounts to (a) denying,
sidelining the problematic of race divisions and (b) suggesting that
divisions are a good thing to start making.

        For example -- the "outing" of class (a class outing?) on the list
a few days back. What purpose does this serve? And would we want to start
outing people by race? Given that we didn't bring up race when we talked
about the class membership of people on the list -- but many of us
probably agree that the problem of class is partly a problem of race --
wasn't the effect of bringing up class in this way effectively a way of
*avoiding* talking about race, a way of apparently discussing
socioeconomic status without mentioning race?

Cable Factory 20
by Lytle Shaw

        Atelos is pleased to
announce the publication of
Cable Factory 20, by Lytle
Shaw.


About the book:
        Inspired by the artist
Robert Smithson’s constructed,
site-specific
convergences, Lytle Shaw has
created both a long poem and a
complex site
for it. The lines of the poem
sit amid assorted visual
images and atop
cartographic backgrounds. This
complex layering of verbal and
visual
vocabularies produces a
terrain of enormous
fascination and beauty. It is
also pertinent to the larger
themes of the work, which is
about formations
and sedimentations — about
deposits of meaning and the
forms that rise out
of or settle into them.
        The work (in 20
sections preceded by a
four-part prefatory section)
is built around terms from
geology and from industry. It
traces structures
and observes workings. Like
William Wordsworth in The
Prelude, Shaw finds
us situated amid these traces,
tracing ourselves. “All links
pressure
skin.” “Sorting can go on
indefinitely.” “Letters man
the fill.”


About the author:
        Lytle Shaw has
previously published four
poetry chapbooks. Two of
these, Flexagon and The Rough
Voice, were created in
collaboration with the
artist Emilie Clark, with whom
he edits Shark, a journal of
poetics and art
writing. The other two, Low
Level Bureaucratic Structures:
A Novel and
Principles of the Emeryville
Shellmound , also include
visual vocabularies,
giving evidence of Shaw’s
continuing investigations of
the relation of
poetry to the languages of art
and architecture.
        He grew up in Ithaca,
New York. After studying
architecture and
literature at Cornell
University, he attended the
University of California
at Berkeley, where he is
completing a dissertation on
Frank O’Hara. His
essays and poems have appeared
in numerous publications,
including The
Chicago Review, Poetics
Journal, Qui Parle, and
Arshile. He now lives in
New York City.


About the project:
        Atelos was founded in
1995 as a project of Hip’s
Road. It is
devoted to publishing, under
the sign of poetry, writing
which challenges
the conventional definitions
of poetry, since such
definitions have tended
to isolate poetry from
intellectual life, arrest its
development, and
curtail its impact. All the
works published as part of the
Atelos project
are commissioned specifically
for it, and each is involved
in some way with
crossing traditional genre
boundaries, including, for
example, those that
would separate theory from
practice, poetry from prose,
essay from drama,
the visual image from the
verbal, the literary from the
non-literary, and
so forth. The Atelos project
when complete will consist of
50 volumes;
Cable Factory 20 is volume 5.
The project directors and
editors are Lyn
Hejinian and Travis Ortiz; the
director for production and
design is Travis
Ortiz; cover production and
design is by Ree Hall.

A quick commercial break here: the first publication from The Gig Editions,
an offshoot of _The Gig_ magazine--


        ALLEN FISHER: THE TOPOLOGICAL SHOVEL

This book collects four essays first published in the early 1980s: they
form a crucial adjunct to Fisher's poetic sequence _Gravity as a
consequence of shape_ but until now have remained difficult of access.  The
book is in two parts.  Part One--“Thumbnail Lecture”, “The Mathematics of
Rimbaud” and “The Topological Shovel”--sets forth, in a variety of
modalities, the preoccupations that inform _Gravity as a consequence of
shape_.  Part Two consists of the long essay “Necessary Business”, in which
Fisher discusses the work of three contemporary British poets, Eric
Mottram, J.H. Prynne and Cris Cheek, as exemplary texts of a poetics of
“new pertinence”.  _The Topological Shovel_ itself remains pertinent
reading to those involved in nonstandard and avantgarde poetics, on either
side of the Atlantic. -- A short bibliography gives a list of the main
sections of _Gravity_ that have to date been published, with information on
how to acquire them.

52pp, large format; $12 Canadian (includes postage within North America) or
6 pounds 50 (includes postage to UK/abroad).  Cheques should be payable on
a Canadian bank & be made out to "Nate Dorward".  Send to: Nate Dorward,
109 Hounslow Ave., Willowdale, ON, M2N 2B1, Canada (email:
ndorward@sprint.ca).

------

.....and that's it folks: except that I should mention the planned
Feb/March
publication of _The Gig_ #4/5, which will be a large (200+pp) perfectbound
issue of the magazine devoted to critical articles on the poetry of Peter
Riley.  Contributors include Peter Middleton, Bob Perelman, Peter Robinson,
John Hall, Simon Perril, Mark Morrisson, Keston Sutherland, Keith Tuma,
Nigel Wheale, Lorand Gaspar, Tony Lopez, James Keery, Tony Baker.... et al!
Advance subscriptions are very much necessary for this project: those who
want copies but have yet to subscribe are urged to drop me a line.

Apropos of the Seattle W.T.O. Meeting and Mayor Guiliani's banishment of

"Of the coming society, it is said that 'nothing in the sanguinary,
blasphemous, or unnatural dreams of the utopians can be compared to what
will actually happen. . . .Rulers will be compelled, in order to maintain
their position and create a semblance of order, to resort to methods that
would appall present-day mankind, hardened as it is. . . .Justice- if, in
this fortunate epoch, any justice can still exist- will forbid the
existence of citizens who are unable to make a fortune. . . .those times
are perhaps quite close at hand. Who knows whether they are not here
already- whether it is not simply the coarsening of our natures that keeps
us from noticing what sort of atmosphere we already breathe?'"

Lawrence: thanks for pointing out the unclarity in the announcement (& the
omission):

1) "payable on a Canadian bank" doesn't mean it's in Canadian funds or
written from a Canadian bankaccount: it just means that it's a (UK or US)
cheque (in UK or US funds) which my bank here will accept.  Actually, most
UK or US cheques are just fine here--I've only ever had one intractable
problem (a cheque from the Poetry Library).  The best thing to do is just
to tell the teller at the bank what you're trying to do & ask if there will
be any problems. -- If you decide to go with Canadian funds it's $15 Cdn to
send one to the UK.

2) yes: Peter Riley (Books) will have the _Shovel_ for sale.   Address: 27
Sturton St., Cambridge, CB1 2QG, UK; email: <priley@dircon.co.uk>.

I should lastly point out that the first volume of _Brixton Fractals_ has
been recently reprinted by Tsunami Editions (Vancouver).  I have a few
spare copies if someone wants to purchase both the _Shovel_ and _Fractals_:
the combined price would be $21 Cdn/ $15.50 US / 10 pounds 50 UK.  It's
also obtainable through Peter Riley or direct from Tsunami (#14—1507 East
2nd Ave., Vancouver, B.C., V5N 1C8, Canada; email: <lounge@netsign.com>).

all best --N

other hi8 camera and connecting with the line input from the audio
mixer and the effects box lined up with the mirage and guitar effects
box, time base correctors all over the place for field freezing and
signal corrections, eye always on the waveform monitor and vectorscope
among the analog machines connected and interconnected with adobe premier
and the relatively slow pc with the huge hard-drive getting its images
from the hi8 output before closing out and slowly losing sync running
through the toaster, the guitar set hard through the marshall amplifier
raising and peaking the harmonics, cutting them out at the lean sound,
shakuhachi and voice combined, azure and me on the floor, on the chair,
microphones everywhere, the bolex tripod doubling as whole worlds look
down on us, us, us

rush ii / new 3/4" edit deck replacing old worn-out broken belt, color

3/4" does insert so black-bursting at the moment through the toaster,
setting up the 1970s character generator for the block look, beginning
working this morning, now it's operating fine in roll crawl and grid mode,
worked with the quicktime images today, as well as azure-ballet and other
supporting or non-supporting materials, hokey guitar playing, some mirage
as well but a great deal of speech processing, i had wanted to go that
route, meanwhile insert editing didn't quite work without rollback on the
hi8 cameras so i've been rerecording and cutting into the original
3/4" work since the hi8 rollback is ok for recording then rerecording with
time base corrector and noise reduction into and through the matrix,
constantly reworking the patchcords, also using the analog synthesizer
this afternoon in order to switch between three cameras controlled with a
voltage-controlled amplifier which then went into the effects on the
toaster 4000 and out again through the usual checkups including phase
which is always slightly off and pedestal always fiercely lowered, using
the audio echo only sparingly and recording a long sequence with azure-
ballet on the laptop and shooting off it with the hi8, then transferring
it to the other hi8 with the tine base corrector and noise reduction to
begin the sequencing described here

transforming colors into jades, will be a silent work except for clacking
on occasion, nothing more, sound of abacus beads in noh rhythm framework,
_nay_ playing improving, thinking about finnish folklore, shaman songs,
noh plays again, some things from the upanishads, the equipment still
silent behind me, decided not to use any of those things, looking at noise
in the old 1970s text generator, it's forced into on-screen characters,
just like a dream is forced from neural noise, thinking perhaps make a

in the 5000, but the 5000 records tapes that play fine in the tr81 and the
tr81 tapes play fine in it as well, recording out in bitter cold susque-
hanna river, working the keying in the toaster and trying for a third
source after recording electric guitar through air coupling (marshall
amplifier, effects, etc. into microphone then into mixer and additional
effects, resonating in the room for added texture, keeping the whole in
balance), adding nay material to the five-second-delay setting, along with
new shakuhachi work, now i work at dancing on the guitar too fast to see

images against a very flattened and somewhat hysteric to-be-determined
studio imagery, as well as more musical recording. i worry that my hands
will slow up; arthritic, i'll remember the fingerboard of the guitar, al-
most a physical memory, the very _thick_ of it, but not the skill the ab-

fingers are invisible, it's the physical against the physical, sound com-
ing in from the remnants of the world, what i can see, if i could see the
things of space that make the air what it is, air-mountains and valleys,
air-trees and rivers, all the air-creatures of this or any other earth.
went out riding to johnson city, the village of johnson city, saw a very
old working carousal there, as well as a pagoda housing parts of an elec-
trical plant, which i photographed, came back and did another 45 minute
music tape, only recording on one side, my fingers hardly moving at this
point, but very satisfied with the sound, going for the shakuhachi later,
it's dark out, river's right outside the window about twenty meters down,
i've been feeling physically a lot healthier since i've been here, what a
surprise, working with a digital delay system and upped it to 32 seconds
for late-night recording and working with a digital shortwave as well, put
up the antenna east/west this evening, only direction really possible in
the building, working with themes of alienation, seduction, gender, the
psychoanalytics of the image, the haunting of the imaginary - which brings
up this intensive work with largely analog equipment, reading the old
waveform monitors once again, tweaking everything from phase to gain to
offset to pedestal, this _visual_ state-of-affairs, riding a system that
refuses constructivity - the only subtext is that of the ntsc signal it-
self, and the rest is amplitude, frequency, etc., with the delay, symbols
for queen, mouth, wheel, superimposed over disheveled azure mouthing aah,
my aah as well off-camera, she's in an open kimono, nothing revealed,
glazed look, tripods everywhere, my mouth's long aaah in background, this
for an evening, but this mindset of the analog, stringing units in any
direction, shortwave in the background looking for numbers stations, it's
the spectral mother all over again, voices, voices, voices

First of all, let me admit that I haven't been following this thread all
that closely because it bores me, and that I might be missing something as a
result.
But I do find it odd that Katie's very mild post is characterized as
"vehement" and "reactionary" simply because she expresses a point of view
that isn't consistent with the political hegemony/correctness that is the
dominant discourse on this list.
Kathy Lou asks:
>What kind of world is it that you live in where it is
>possible to separate language from politics? from power?
>from race? from class? from gender?
Of course language can't be seperated from any of those things. They're made
out of language. Poems are made out of language, too. But it just doesn't
follow that poems are made of politics, class, etc.

        Now, to a certain extent this ordering makes sense. But it does
seem clear to me that I would never walk in to a bookstore and find a
shelf "working class poetry", or if I did, I'd know immediately that it
was a conscious decision on the part of the manager rather than an
acceptance of a particular, commonly accepted mode of putting the bricks
in the boxes."

*****************************

The overall shape of poetry in bookstores, tells us some interesting
things about the current shape of culture.  I have not seen too many
stores that "organize their books by race,"  and the idea is pretty
fascinating.  When i lived in Boston, the magnificent poetry bookshop,
Groliers, had essentially two sequences:  almost all books of poetry,
organized alphabetically by author,  and a separate sequence taking up
about three shelves, labelled Language Poetry.  As the Boston poet Joe
Torra pointed out to the owner, this was surely a major ghettoization kind
of move, and represented a sharp (albeit ambiguous) statement....


I've just noticed Simon is writing from a Hahhvahd account:  it isn't the
current arrangement at Groliers you're referring to is it?

Traceroute is a simple event.  Very little data is moved.  The idea that
this could cause the net to have problems is crazy.  Even with all the other
stuff to be moved on that date.  I would suggest that with most businesses
shut down the actual traffic on the network on the changeover will actually
be smaller than average and certainly smaller than peaks from the past

It sounds to me like a great idea to map the hops at the change to the new
year.

It seems pointless to refrain from doing this because of concerns about
network stability.

Just my 2 cents.

Subject: Group 4, response to DuPlessis and Bellamy

I'm wasn't really sure how to respond to your post, Rachel, except perhaps
to recycle some arguments from Sianne Ngai's "Poetics of Disgust" essay,
which I don't have on hand.  It seems, nonetheless, to have something to =
do
with the "good doo doo" (a quote from a Deanna Ferguson poem) aspect of =
the
"abject" corner of Language writing, and I guess is forcing a =
consideration
of the ugliness of its clashing syllables versus the relative clarity of =
the
references to thinkers such as Kristeva (whom I've never really read) and
Freud.  And to suggest, elsewhere, that the "dream" permits a sort of =
never
coming to "terms" with gender, which I suppose is a position I am =
attracted
to (I tend to call it enforced adolescence, hence putting it in a social
scale) though would not quite know how to declare.  McCaffery on semantic
slippage in bpNichol's wordplay also comes to mind, but I'm not sure =
whether
I should interpret the text or respond to it on its terms (a little of =
both,
it seems).  However, now that my stream-of-nothingness is running full
speed, here is a direct connect:

I was reading Paul Goodman's Growing Up Absurd this morning on the subway, =
a
book which is kind of boring to read all the way through, and when it's
least boring it seems rather wrong, but nonetheless interesting as an
attempted dialogue with a generation much younger than him, the Beats in =
the
case of the chapter I find interesting.  He writes, concerning the =
sexuality
of the Beats:

"So perhaps another reason for their dropping the old physical jazz and
revival is just the opposite, that the display of energy would upset their
coolness, it would be embarrassing to make them feel too young.  I wonder =
if
this is not the simple explanation of their disdain of social dancing as
"dry" sex; for certainly one of the reasonable uses of social dancing is
body contact and sometimes sexual foreplay.  But these boys are =
embarrassed
to get an erection, to betray feeling, in public, though they are more =
than
willing to take their clothes off and exhibit themselves, or to beat a =
drum
wildly in public as an exhibition for the others, but not as contact with
them." (182)

This addresses one paradox, as the purported "freedom" associated with
running around naked that is held up against society's repression actually
comes up cold in those moments within society in which "sexual foreplay" =
can
be enacted in public.  I remember reading in Habermas about the sixties
political youth movements that there was a certain narcissism present in
much of this activity that would limit the actions to displays, but that
there was no chance for them to take the majority role once anything was
achieved as their self-image would be disrupted.  I think of this a fair
amount (poets should dress like bankers, Auden once wrote), as I wonder =
how
many are willing to make this flip from performative disdain to =
responsible
member of a community should that community gain political weight, or
whether anyone cares about this.  Elsewhere Goodman writes of these male
Beat poets have a "healthy sexuality" in fact, but he sees the role that
women played in the community as primarily maternal, with the young men
bursting into tears the moment someone like Kenneth Patchen says their
poetry's childish, and the woman poet stepping in to coo reassurances in
their ear.  This seems a little opposite of what we generally take to be =
the
story of the Beat era, whose best poets were gay and whose women poets =
were
often radical individualists (is that a word?) but had been excluded from
the male-centered self-canons.  But Goodman makes it clear that "Beat" and
"artist" were not synonymous (he argues many points regarding this), =
hence,
though there were hundreds of people keeping notebooks and drawing =
pictures
and calling themselves "artists", few had a framework for viewing the =
world
in terms of social relations due to the pure excitment of the Beat =
community
itself as experience.  (This brings to mind something tangential: we all
bitch and moan about how the "community" is not fer real today, it's just
some pose, but actually, were the community to be as exciting and
self-concerned as the Beats, we might have worse poets -- who knows.)

Anyway, to bring this back to Dodie's essay, there seems to be a paradox
present in that she writes she is "working towards a writing that subverts
sexual bragging, a writing that champions the vulnerable, the fractured, =
the
disenfranchised, the sexually fucked-up," and at the same time would not
want one with "x-ray vision" to see the "frayed elastic on my panties."  =
Her
essay itself, which argues for the person for whom "EAT SHIT" could be an
erotic suggestion, seems to set up a forceful argument along the lines of
"you must take all of this in to 'qualify' as a radical" via a very
performative language -- she don't mince words -- and yet at the same time
looks at the "vulnerable," and where radical sexuality crosses with social
pose in the many anecdotes later on.  So the abstraction of the "body", =
she
argues, should be brought to some specific materiality probably through
anecdote (as she is a prose writer), but on the other she as the reader
becomes vulnerable once this body appears in the writing -- hence the
challenge, the need for form in presenting oneself. Both pure abstraction =
--
leaping from critical term to critical term -- and pure exhibitionism -- =
as
I've heard at several New York poetry readings and probably not for the =
last
time: "here is a poem about my CLITORIS" (hahaha goes the audience) -- =
fail
because they don't engage with the struggle with form.

Well, I'm not asking everyone, i.e. these writers of the latter group, to
mature; as I wrote above, I think the pre-adolescent mode of writing is
perfectly legit (Rimbaud haunts this discussion, I feel, his sonnets about
seeing the erect dicks of bulls at the county fair, for instance, combined
with his Catholicism).  However, it seems that part of the challenge is
using this erotic tendency to "do good" in a way.  I think some writers =
are
doing this now, or are beginning to: a book I've received recently, by a =
guy
named Garrett Caples, takes on the lack of eroticism in what he considers
the "Victorian" underpinings of the Language poets is a case in point.  So
here is a younger poet using performatively "vulgar" language (the poem is
called "Humped by Barrett Watten") to somehow address larger social =
issues,
while trying to avoid what he would probably consider the castration of
abstract terminology and the social control of theoretical models.  I'm =
sure
some people consider him inarticulate, mean, or completely untalented to =
do
this in the way he does, but I think he's interesting precisely because =
his
pose (or reality, who knows when he wrote these) is of an adolescent
refusing to give up the directness of his pre-discursive, poly-sexual
experience while keeping his eyes on the future, which is that of social
scales of meaning, and potential conformity.  (Some of the poems are =
really
very good, a sure improvement on the "Beats", though tied to a nostalgic
surrealism.)  To quote Dodie on Samuel Delaney: "*Hogg* constantly compels
the reader to choose one filth-laden situation *over* another, when most =
of
us would simply want to be rid of the entire set of experiences."  In
language, this "set of experiences" would be words that are deemed
counter-discursive, words of "disgust," the Calibanic perhaps, but also =
the
discursive content when it is deemed offensive to sexual mores.  So, Hogg
forces us to conceive of a hierarchy of values, a structure, where once =
was
a shit-mound of unassimilable experience; once this structure is =
conceived,
what's to stop one from attaching it to the larger ethical structures we
associate with democracy?

I feel like I could go on with this -- wanted to mention the new law =
against
distributing "crush" videos, which I've read about in the Voice (I don't
think cute animals should die for anyone's sexual pleasure myself) -- but
this is probably too long.

Attached to this email, however, is a little poem that uses the words of
Rachel's text.  I ran some computer processes on it; actually, all I did =
was
alphabetize the words in it and then construct shorter poems from them.
However, various faults in the method left a cluster of non-alphabetized
words at the top, and words that appear after m-dashes and slashes are not
alphabetized.  These processes usually display the formless subconsious of
certain texts, but it's hard to imagine a subconscious to Rachel's text --
it's so "exposed" -- so this actually provides a superego for it.  Change =
or
add to it what you will.

Ok, gotta run.

The "Open Letter" issue of _Open Letter_ magazine

CALL FOR OPEN LETTERS TO POETS

Deadline: 28 February, 2000

We invite open letters to contemporary poets -- addressed
across generations, aesthetic tendencies, communities, political
boundaries. Letters received by 28 Feb. will be forwarded to the
poets addressed; addressees will have a chance to reply and be
included in our "Open Letter" _Open Letter_ Spring issue. We
will consider publishing letters and responses, and letters that do
not receive responses, and also poetry -- where doing so brings
out a particular juncture of debate.

We are interested in complicating given literary lineages, in
overturning abstract categorizations of poets' methods and
socio-aesthetic formations, in rediscovering and questioning
received critical formulae concerning a poets work or milieu,
and in bringing about new close and historical readings and
critiques. In this special issue of _Open Letter_, we want to
emphazize the dialogic, analytical and constructivist possibilities
of address to and between poets and socio-aesthetic tendencies,
by means of the open letter's form of public intimacy. Our focus,
then, is on the discursive letter, rather than on the poetic form of
the letter (which has recently been explored in _Chain_ 6).

Our intent is to complicate how kinds of poetic "positions"
articulate themselves, and are articulated, and are perceived as
available and "occupied" in contemporary poetries-as aesthetic
tendency, method, point of group identification, etc.

A willful return to a dated technology, but a return that harkens
to founding motives of Open Letter magazine: the open letter.
This special issue hopes to contribute to the current forums and
formats available for poetic discussion. These include the
Buffalo poetics listserv (and _Poetics@_, its recent anthology),
the _PhillyTalks_ newsletter, which presents poets in written
dialogue (and which this project most resembles), the
question/answer model of _99 Poets_ (and its predecessors,
back to _L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E_), the poet's talk as collected
in, e.g., _Writing/Talks_, and the poet's essay -- from
_Curriculum of the Soul_ to _Poetics Journal_, _Tripwire_ or
_Shark_.

...but then, there's the question of whether or not one wants to lend any
kind of legitimacy to the proceedings. That Pyrnne was on the list
surprised me (argh! I confess! I read the New Yorker!) But given the sorry
state of the New Yorker's poetry these days ("no shoes, no shirt, no
status as canonical writer, no service"), why sign your name to the
current marketing techniques of "big press poetry", where a little sop to
the "hip" is like the salsa with turkey.

The only reason I can think to bust out the vote for Prynne would be that
if he made a decent showing, more might read his work.

A Spicer Story (sort of)

This last weekend I was on a walk (here in San Francisco) with friends that=20
started at Fog City Diner on the Embarcadero side of Telegraph Hill. We went=
=20
up the steps to Coit Tower - took in the wonderful murals from the WPA=20
thirties (which are, among other things, a great embodiment of the art,=20
intellectual and political life of the City circa 1939) - went down the hill=
=20
into North Beach, passed not far from Gino & Carlos to Washington Square Par=
k=20
to take in the Fire Department sculpture/shrine (there's always a recent bee=
r=20
bottle up the outstretched bronze fingers of the Fireman); went up to the SF=
=20
Art Institute where, on the inside Mission Revival style patio, in progress=20
is a Hollywood style production of a film to be called "The Sculptress" - th=
e=20
dark haired heroine - looking appropriately schoolish and devoted - quotes=20
her lines behind from behind a cut green-leafed tree branch held up on a rod=
=20
with a metal clamp while we step into the Gallery to look at the splendid=20
Diego Rivera mural: an optimistic, worker centered vertical scaffold vision=20=
-=20
including the painter and his assistants - in which City and country are=20
being rebuilt. A fiction upon a fiction.
    From the Art Institute we walk over the bay side of Russian Hill and tak=
e=20
Polk Street down to Aquatic Park where we sit down on the edge of a low,=20
contoured sea wall that separates the narrow beach from the sidewalk, the=20
Maritime Museum building and the matching contour concrete bleachers that=20
rise and overlook the harbor which is almost entirely encircled by the curve=
=20
of two breakwaters - the view a lovely kind of cement necklace with an=20
opening out to the larger bay with Angel Island and Mt. Tamalpais rising in=20
the distance through a mix of sun, clouds and fog.
    The beach itself is a full of grey and black, large stones, remnants fro=
m=20
the construction of the sea wall and breakwater; their odd wet shapes, some=20
full of myriad angles and planes, once broken apart by steam shovel, sledge=20
hammers, and/or picks. Directly in front of us, in this relatively small=20
vista, a number of the stones are precariously balanced, one on one =96=20
sometimes there are three =96 standing end upon end, creating improbable=20
geometric figures, a feather-touch from falling over. At the front of two or=
=20
three receding rows, a thin, olive complexioned man - maybe 12 feet down fro=
m=20
us - is crouched on one knee, both hands gripped around a large stone; he=20
holds it up and positions the lower end over another "base" stone and begins=
=20
to explore the point where a plane on one rock will match and balance itself=
=20
on a plane of the other. Testing and shifting the balance, he twists and=20
tilts the upper stone - lightly scraping it on the other, moving it up and=20
down one plane, then another. If there's slippage, he pivots the rock and=20
tests it again. He never adjusts the bottom rock, as if that will be somehow=
=20
to cheat or alter some basic fact. His long, slender fingers resemble those=20
of a piano player; in fact the process of working the stones is perhaps=20
comparable to tuning an instrument, listening for the perfect pitch. Three,=20
maybe five minutes pass. He is patient, very patient and he works as if=20
unquestionably convinced that a singular balance will come to figure.=20
Finally, if the activity were not so focused, one might say "as if by magic"=
=20
- he finds the tilt, the balance that works; gradually he withdraws his hand=
s=20
to make a complete break and comes out of his crouch to observe the combined=
=20
shape of the two stones.
    Spontaneously we clap. "This is a gift," he speaks to us, "I've been=20
given this gift. It takes patience. It is a gift to the City." He sweeps his=
=20
arm out across the Bay towards the Bay, the islands and Mt. Tamalpais. "This=
=20
is a powerful place. All that energy comes right to here. To find the balanc=
e=20
I just have to be patient. I had to learn patience." There is a faded dark,=20
blue bracelet design tattoo on his wrist, another tattoo up on his forearm,=20
and one on his neck - possibly a gang, prison time or both: a life time=20
totally separate and behind him. As he speaks a small waves knocks over two=20
of the sculptures. =93At the end of the day, they all come down. At night th=

birds need to eat the creatures in the sand without getting injured.=94 He t=
hen=20
asks, "Would someone like to pick a rock? I can work with anything I can=20
lift." One of our friends picks a rock and the process begins again.
=20
In Peter Gizzi's excellent Afterword to his book, The House That Jack Built,=
=20
The Collected Lectures of Jack Spicer,  he describes the late poet in and=20
around North Beach, including his usual afternoon stroll to Aquatic Park - a=
=20
route not dissimilar to the one we have taken. Here, if he did not meet or=20
gather with other friends, he sat to listen in solitude to the Giants=20
baseball game on a transistor radio. This Park one of those places -  an=20
urban version of a sacred grove  - where power gathers and takes focus. A=20
place to be open, to take in =93the dictation,=94 those powerful forces from=

outside, that could invade the poet=92s body anywhere, anytime. To be on the=

intractable syllables; words, to which the poet patiently listens, tilts, an=

gravitationally balanced and loaded. Poet and Sculptor - both tested and=20

Hey folks, check the vibe on this:
Monday the 13th, at the Knitting Factory -
10 pm until 1 a.m.

Thelonius Monk's Epistrophy done '90's style....

Sorry about the recent flurry of e-mails, but as they say, 'tis the
season..=
.
The Epistrophy Evening: mad flavaz in ya zone - more Subliminal Minded
material for you to savour...
so folks this is a benefit for A Gathering of the Tribes, an institution
that has supported avant garde culture for a while, so check the vibe, so
as always it's s situation representing a whole bunch of scenarios: A Guy
Called Gerald, Samuel Delaney, David Hammons, Steve Canon and yours truly
present:
film, literature, and music - here's the 411:

Music:
The Playas:
London Afro-Futurist Avant Garde drum n bass veteran A Guy Called Gerald
versus Dj Spooky that Subliminal Kid and
legendary free jazz pianist Matthew Shipp

and the event has some special sneak preview of  new material from
David Hammons, probably one of the most important African American artists
of the last 20 years who has been working on a Dj vinyl project...

Film:
and
and a film entitled "The Lure of the Ancestors" a documentary by Olumide,
who worked on the award winning film "Slam" that featured Saul William and
Soundtrack by Dj Spooky, on the linkages of Yoruba and Yoruba influenced
percussion and American polyrhythms (Baba Olatunji, Abiodun Oyewole,
CYnthia Turner, Eric Bobo, etc etc ...)

Words:
and then there's the people reading:
legendary science fiction writer Samuel Delaney with new material
Steve Canon, the director of A Gathering of the Tribes
Edwin Torres
David Henderson
Iris A.
Stacyann Chin
Carl Hancock Rux
Mariposa

plus special guests...
tix: $10  - all proceeds from the event go to A Gathering of the Tribes

Epistrophy was what Theloniuous Monk used to call his style of thinking and
playing, but
most who check out the word in the dictionary will simply find that it
means "return from an abnormal mental state." Anybody who's checked out "A
Gathering of the Tribes," an independent non-profit magazine that has been
one of the best Lower East Side and East Village journals of poetry and art
for a long while, and host of alot of art shows relating jazz and
contemporary culture, will see that it's an arts organization that has
allowed alot of people to get their ideas out into the world, and turn
their backs, like Theloniuous Monk, to the conventional music, poetry, and
arts scenes.  Basically this is a benefit for the magazine and arts space
that's associated with. The main theme of the evening will be a duo between
internationally renowned experimental jazz pianist Matthew Shipp and sonic
chaos in the form of tunrtable terror from yours truly, downtown enfant
terrible Dj
Spooky that Subliminal Kid and London legendary drum n bass innovator A Guy
Called gerald. In addition to these artists, highly respected artist David
hammons is previewing some of his new sounds from a sound project he's been
working on, and one of the most important science
fiction writers working in the field over the last several decades, Samuel
Delaney will be reading from some of his more recent books. And critically
acclaimed poets, Steve Cannon (who runs Tribes), and David Henderson will
be reading. Expect an
evening of special guests to make apearances as well because everyone from
the jazz musicians and performing artists have worked with Tribes in the
past to younger more hip-hop and electronica influenced artists will be
making showing up. All proceeds go to a Gathering of the Tribes.

Knitting factory, main space, December 12th, tickets, $10

I thought I'd missed something here, so I checked with
Tom Raworth and learned that this response was to a
private message, not to a post to this list.  If this was in
error, I'm sure we can all relate to that.  What is unfortunate
is that Tom's original message (which he forwarded to me,
after my inquiry to him) was poorly represented, and
in a meanspirited manner.  It's even more unfortunate
that no acknowledgment has been made of the error
to the forum in which it was made.

This was written last night, my first time visiting the atlanta poetry group.  The evening plan was to take turns reading from Finnegans Wake and see what developed.  There was a lot of conversation, and the readings were a lot of fun too. I'll admit that I've always been somewhat scared of this book but after hearing all the different voices reading it last night I'm excited to try and read now.

I've also never written collaboratively before and so this was a new experience for me.  Having Joyce in my ear in the hours preceding the writing certainly contributed to writing like I've never written before.

The authors of the piece above were James Sanders, John Lowther, Mark Prejsnar and myself. It's too bad that the other folks in the group, Karen Phillips, Dana Lustig and Ted Ian, had to leave before we got around to writing anything, I would have been curious to see what they would have contributed to the piece.

Thanks to them all for having me and I hope that this list will be amused by the writing above.

Sincerely,

Marla

The reason to vote for Prynne is to demonstrate the difference in quality
between what is being written these days and what gets published in the New
Yorker itself.

Prynne, in this sense, could be any one of us. It's fine that it's him.

grolier's does now categorize by not only race but ethnicity, nationality,
sexuality, etc.  i asked louisa about this and she said it helps the books
move more quickly, ie. sales are better.  for an idependent bookstore eking
out an existence (and th eonly bookstore nationally to specialize
exclusively in poetry) is makes sense to make a decision based on what will
help the books sell.  Moreover, on the subject of "working class poetry" as
a category, that day may yet come.  there's nothing eternal or unchanging
about bookstore marketing categories.

Well, Borders for one (where, I admit, I work) arranges literature via
literature, with subsections (i.e. numbering systems for inventory
purposes) for "African-American" literature, as well as another
subsection (which is actually a subsection of the general psychology
section) for Gay-Lesbian literature (which includes fiction as well as
poetry...&, on a more interesting note, Gertrude Stein, Oscar Wilde,
Jeanette Winterson, are included in the general literature section,
while Robert Duncan, Jack Spicer, etc. are included in the general
poetry section...although Justin Chin & the one book by Camille Roy
are both in the Gay/Lesbian section). No other race (i.e.
Asian-American, Chicano, Native American, and so on) &/or group are
represented as such in the literature section.

Subject:      Re: CLASS (fwd)

I disagree that Katie's post was "very mild." And I do not
think that she "simply expresses a point of view" as much
as she dismisses an alternate point of view. I believe the
main point of her post was "shut up about poetry and class
issues."
And I have yet to hear her support her assertions. The
following is an observation that lacks explanation or
supporting argumentation:
"Of course language can't be seperated [sic] from any of
those things. They're made out of language. Poems are made
out of language, too. But it just doesn't follow that
poems are made of politics, class, etc".
I believe that attempting to divorce writing from its
social/political contexts is dangerous. The act of
pretending that writing isn't political results in support
of dominant power relations. It results in sticking one's
head in the sand, in effect saying "don't talk about
things like racism that make me uncomfortable." I also
think it results in misreadings and shallow readings. I
return to the example of Erica Hunt. An analysis of Hunt's
that only concerned itself with "form, structure" etc. (as
if those things themselves weren't political!) would
result in a very uniformed, very cursory reading of this
important experimental poet.
But if you find discussions of class and writing "boring,"
I probably can't help you here. I would suggest however
that the privilege to ignore class issues is just that: a
privilege.
I believe Taylor Brady's poetic response constituted a
useful explication of these issues.
I also find it really interesting that suddenly concern
with a working class poetics is "political hegemony/
correctness)". I am constantly personally attacked for
raising class issues in the context of writing -- when and
where this discourse became "hegemonic" certainly eludes
me.

The death of Ed Dorn represents a great loss, if not unexpected.
I did not know him, though I found his work delightful and important;
out of respect for his friends, I will offer only this poem from his book
-Geography- (London: Fulcrum Press, 1965). Chris

No hesitation
                    would stay me

their homes float though and float
on the ribbed ships of their frail
bodies,

keep my own misery close to theirs
associate me with no other honor.

It seems to me that this same argument could be used to suggest that
affirmative action laws should be abolished. Change is slow, nay, and
happens in increments like this, at least this is how I imagine this
happened: Susan Wheeler, due to proximity and pedigree, gets invited to be
one of the judges. Susan Wheeler is a cool woman and and interesting poet
who is interested in interesting poetry. So she nominates an interesting
poet. Why not support this tiny ray of light? Picture tiny ray of light
through chink in the wall as preface to huge block of wall falling out to
reveal lots of light. You'll feel better than with the salsa/turkey analogy.

The only reason I can think to bust out the vote for Prynne would be that

uhm, having dissed the apg in an earlier post, i thought i should say, having
just read most of the mirage #4 atlanta anthology, that it certainly has some
interesting work--  among other things:  a couple of cool collage poems by
james sanders; randy prunty's funny "gender rinse" and dana lisa lustig's
faux-naive "st. francis . . . "

about the grolier, if your idea of it is, say, that of the clubby little
bookshop brad gooch describes in his o'hara bio--forget it.  no browsing is
allowed--you come in with the name of the book you want, the owner retrieves
it for you--and then you're told to leave.  a draconian policy necessitated
by, what i was told by the owner herself, was the experimentalist poets'
addiction to ripping off books.  any book or zine w/ merely the whiff of the
av-garde is now verbotten.  perhaps the owner has relented since i was there
last.  it's hard to think of her keeping up this policy indefinitely.  but i
wouldn't know-- as someone who used to drop quite a lot of lettuce at the
grolier every week--i will never set foot inside there again.

For anyone who's curious about my book in spite of its
recent panning, here's a chapter from it.  It discusses
poetry that is, or is like, what is commonly called
language poetry.  Comments welcome.

                                        --Bob Grumman

CHAPTER NINETEEN =


=02Xenolinguistic Poetry =02


Language poetry in my poetics is a form of what I =

eventually came to call =15xenolinguistic poetry=15--that =

is, it is poetry whose syntax or train of thought is =

linguistically strange to an extreme.  It was the =

last kind of poetry I was able to come to terms =

with--if, indeed, I =15have=15 come to terms with it.  For =

years only my desire to comprehend =15all=15 poetry kept =

me going back to it, trying to appreciate it--even =

to the extent of reading the famous primer on it, =

the almost impenetrable =15The L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE Book=15.  I =

didn't start getting much of a fix on the stuff, =

however, until I came on Crag Hill's =15DICT=15, or the =

four pages or so of that work that were published in =

=15Red Lines, No. 7=15. =


 illustration I couldn't transmit cybernetically

One characteristic of the =15DICT=15 excerpt that helped =

was that its poems are all less than ten words in =

length, and thus easy to get hold of.  But what most =

helped me was that it has a unifying, underlying =

framework--the bones of a dictionary.  What does =

this accomplish?  For one thing, it provides an =

alphabetic rationale for the arrangement of the =

sequence's subjects.  It alerts us as well to the =

fact that we are to be concerned with spellings and =

definitions.  With fundamentals of language, too, =

and probably (by extension) fundamentals of =

Everything.  At the same time, it surrounds us with =

an ambience of authority, of exact rules--something =

secure to roam freely out of, to laugh at contrasts =

to, to deconstruct fearlessly from, and so forth. =


All this would mean little if the poems or stanzas =

of =15DICT=15 weren't effective in themselves, but they =

are.  Take, for instance, "ABASE," the very first =

word of the sequence.  It is an almost perfect =

choice for its position for the following reasons: =

(1) it begins the sequence's journey in the proper =

place alphabetically (i.e., at ABA); (2) it begins =

it structurally appropriately at "a base" and (3) it =

begins it philosophically appropriately at a tearing =

down, at a kind of reduction (of rank or estimation, =

my pocket dictionary has it).  In short, Hill in one =

word tells us what he's up to (overtly, at least): =

a reduction back to first principals. =


The next word--on a line by itself--is "meaning."  =

So now we know we are to be concerned with the =

reduction (or abasing) of meaning.  And with basic =

meanings.  Perhaps also with gross (base) meanings. =

=7FA line later the non-word "=15ABCD=15" appears.  Our =

alphabetical trip is starting--in pre-meaning, also =

in the elements, in the letters which precede =

wording; in the base.  One thinks, too, of baby =

talk, and a child's first experiences with letters =

and words. =


On the third line is the phrase, "distinct A-
horizons."  I don't know what an A-horizon is (in =

the real world) or if there is such a thing.  But =

the phrase, in coming just after "ABCD," underscores =

orderliness, officialness, even (horizontal) =

straightness.  And the "A-nature" of the words to =

follow is announced, or emphasized, as well as the =

fact that we are starting at A, with nothing but "A-
horizons" visible ahead of us. =


Then: "abr abbr," or (possibly) the word, =

"abbreviation," abbreviated (twice)--after =

misstarting.  The journey which started with "ABCD," =

then was interrupted by "distinct A-horizons," has =

now advanced one step from formal letters to an =

awkward, shaky first step into "word-ness"--which is =

abbreviated to its smallest state.  The alphabetical =

sequence is maintained, too, as we go from ABA and =

ABC to ABR--then back slightly to ABB. =


A pun of sorts comes next, "state of =02be=02ing" =

(my emphasis) suddenly cropping up in this "b" =

section of the A's.  It keeps the reader's attention =

on such philosophical concerns as the relation of =

meaning to being.  Alone in the line under "state of =

being" is an X.  It forms a sudden center, and is =

also a loud retort, to all the A's.  It suggests =

some idea of a distinct state of being, too.  We're =

still at a kind of starting point, but now at a =

first essence (an unknown quantity) as well as at a =

first letter.  But we're also at a "layer of =

substance," according to the next line. =


Because the lineation forces attention on the text =

one word or syllable at a time (for the most part), =

I again spin off any mainline into a thought of =

"substance" as "sub-stance," or of being not yet in =

a stance.  Preliminariness holds.  Incompleteness, =

too, as the truncatedness of the next two entries, =

"cordant note" and "ately released," indicates.
"cordant" makes me think of discordance, of course, =

particularly in such an assortment of not closely =

interrelated entries, but then I am struck with the =

pleasant opposite to discordance, "cordance"--core-
dance.  Is the X the note (and "core") referred to? =


"ace" then intrudes and its quotidian definition as =

a playing card whose face is marked "with one large =

pip."  This is followed by a line that doesn't =

compute for me but is nice.  The first entry in =15DICT=15 =

which uses punctuation, it consists of a colon =

followed by a space and then the word, "plants."  =

Or: a sense of expectancy, followed by a word =

representing the ultimate natural realization of =

expectations. =


"plants" is repeated on the following line, with a =

space after it--and, finally, a semi-colon, to =

represent a sense of semi-completion.  All this =

might be a contrast to the mechanical, unAprillike =

nature of the dictionary which is its field, or a =

reference to the semantic breeding ground that a =

dictionary is, or who knows what.  Which makes me =

suddenly recall, as I write this, that a pip is a =

seed.  So the flow from the ace to plants is not =

illogical.  Ah, another connection: a pip begins the =

"deck" of spring as an ace begins a deck of =

cards. . . .  And as a's begin the alphabet.  So =

many similar and contrasting games are thus caught =

here abudding! =


And so Hill's sequence flows on, making the =

dictionary into a playground, and filling the reader =

with the feel of creativity, of words being born, =

and meanings, and realities. . . .  Look, it =

proclaims--only look closely at the world, or at the =

best lists of the names for its contents: the world =

is alive, and rich! =


Another of my successes as an aesthcipient of =

language poetry occurred when I got a copy of =15In the =15
=15American Tree=15, an anthology of language poetry =

edited by Ron Silliman.  It involved some poems by =

Robert Grenier, the first of which, just six lines =

in length, reads as follows: =


                    ...

                    a long walk
                    a long
                    walk a long
                    walk a long
                    walk along

About this I wrote in an issue of the =15Score Review=15 =

as follows: =


   My first reaction, typical for me, was =

   dismissive. All I saw was trivial repetition of =

   trivial words for no good reason.  Maybe the =

   poem was of slight value for the way the =

   boringness of its diction metaphored the =

   boringness of its subject matter, "a long =

   walk," but it did nothing more worthwhile than
   that for me.

   So I went on to Grenier's next poem, "Wintry," =

   predisposed to dismiss it as well.  For a while =

   that was easy: all it seemed to consist of were =

   juvenile word plays like a rhyme of "icy" with =

   "nicely," and some foolery with the way the =

   Germans and Norwegians in the text pronounce, =

   "well" as "vell." But I had to admit that, =

   despite the brevity of its lines and strophes, =

   it got an ambience of some northern American =

   countryside and its down-to-earth but pleasant =

   German/Scandinavian farmer-types going through =

   me. Then I turned the page.  There the poem =

   ended in three strophes: =


                      snow
                      blue
                      eyes

                      ice
                      blue
                      rocks

                      rocks
                      rocks of
                      getting dark

   I was at once converted to Grenier's way with =

   words. =


   One thing I liked was the way the text, after =

   saying pretty much nothing but, "Oh well," "Oh =

   vell," "I don't know," and "Yah" for five =

   strophes, suddenly zeroes down to two kinds of =

   blue, soft and hard, both of them vitally =

   palpable after the mundaneness of what's =

   preceded.  Both, too, are extremely in context, =

   the earlier strophes having discussed winter to =

   set up snow and ice, and shown a Nordic accent =

   to set up blue eyes. =

   =

   Something else happens: eyes are, through =

   parallelism, implicitly compared to rocks.  =

   They can thus be taken as being mineral and =

   insensitive, and enduring; or the rocks can be =

   thought of as being Nature's eyes. Humans with =

   winter in them, rocks with awareness in =

   them=FA.=FA.=FA. and all the scene as elemental as =

   the lines describing it. =


   The capper to the poem for me, though, is the =

   poem's final strophe.  There the peculiar =

   locution, "rocks of getting dark," presents us =

   with rocks that are somehow comprised of the =

   act of getting dark.  Darkness is stealing into =

   a locale and, apparently, solidifying there =

   like water into ice, rock-hard ice.  At the =

   same time, parts of speech blurring in the =

   confused syntax of the strophe, I visualize, =

   and feel, a countryside's being rocked to =

   darkness like an infant's being rocked to =

   sleep--to some kind of deep final stasis. =

   =

   Of course, "getting dark," on a line by itself =

   as it is, might simply indicate a new subject's =

   having been introduced, the fact that it is =

   getting dark.  Perhaps the narrator was about =

   to address in greater detail what the rocks =

   he's speaking of are made of, but he's tired, =

   too tired--or bored--to go on, and it's getting =

   dark.  Still, the phrase "rocks of getting =

   dark" arises naturally from the poem.  Maybe =

   everything is going to sleep--in all senses of =

   the word.  (And I think of Robert Frost's =

   "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.") =


   Whatever its final "meaning," the poem turned =

   me back to Grenier's previous poem with a =

   considerably less condescending attitude.  This =

   time around I saw, for the first time, how "a =

   long" becomes "along."  The poem indeed =

   metaphors the monotony of a long walk going on =

   and on and on.  But it does more: it surprises =

   us with a pun.  The "along" part of the latter =

   is, of course, amusing, but it is lyrical, too, =

   for it doesn't just describe a person as =

   "walking along," or going onward; it also =

   describes him as walking by the side of =

   something. In other words, he is not aimlessly =

   walking, but interacting--in relation--with his =

   environment.  He has a route, he is performing =

   Roethke's "waltz of To." And, it is strongly =

   implied, he is consciously doing so; he is =

   intentioned. =


   That might not seem a big deal, but to me =

   there's nothing more profound and archetypal =

   than to be purposefully following a route, to =

   be located in the universe, and consciously =

   going somewhere!  And Grenier shows how that =

   feels with maximal vividness, by springing his =

   readers into a sense of it as abruptly, and =

   from as nakedly and repetitiously nowhere-going =

   a situation, as possible. =


   He thus allows an apprentice appreciator of =

   language poetry like me to get some idea of how =

   much a flawlessly-executed preposition like =

   "along" can do, even in a poem a mere 13 words =

   in length!  And, as "Wintry" shows, his use of =

   other kinds of words (participles such as, =

   "getting," for instance) is equally skillful.  =

   Ergo, there must be something to his kind of =

   poetry! =


I was particularly happy with one result of my =

little review: Bob Grenier saw fit after reading it =

to send me a very nice and appreciative letter--with =

an autographed copy of one of his books.  That he =

also took the time to point out that the "2" poems =

I'd analyzed were actually =153=15, the "passage" starting =

with "snow/ blue/ eyes" actually being a complete =

poem in itself, didn't perturb me.  After all, the =

two poems I treated as one =15did=15 go together, sort =

of=F6=F6and no title, only a line of asterisks, separated =

the two on the page they shared.  Anyway, I'm always =

making preposterous mistakes as a critic.  For =

instance, back in college (in my late thirties, the =

reader will recall) I was taking a class (one of the =

most enjoyable and valuable ones I ever took)--in =

poetics.  Part of the required work was to analyze =

few poems out of a bunch the class's teacher, the =

poet Robert Reid, had xeroxed for us. =


One of the poems was by Reid himself.  Ah, thought =

I, what better way to check my critical acumen than =

to analyze a poem whose very author is available to =

judge the result!  So I batted out five or six =

hundred words on it.  Well, its title, "Window =

Seat," destroyed me.  Even though the poem spoke of =

passing over a house, and of looking down, and so =

forth, its title led me to place it not in an =

airplane, as I should have, but in a quaint old New =

England house possessing something called a window =

seat.=7F It was a far more foolish mistake than the =

one I made with Grenier's poems, but I still got an =


"A" on my paper--which encouragement no doubt was at =

least partially responsible, eventually, for this =

book!  So Professor Reid has much to answer for! =


As for my Grenier mistake, I agreed with Grenier =

that it =15was=15 a mistake--but I didn't agree with his =

later comment that there is "no 'along with', or 'by =

=15the side of=15 something'" in his first poem.  But =

those =15are=15--harumpf--possible meanings of "along," =

whatever their user intended by his preposition.  =

Anyway, the main object of the critic is not to get =

everything right, but to get his readers' =

sensitivities purring. =


I analyzed several other language poems around this =

time.  Then my taxonomania taking over, I worked up =

a fairly elaborate system of terms for the various =

kinds of language poetry I believed there to be.  I =

even got an essay I wrote about the system published =

in a magazine called =15SkyViews=15.  Again, though, I =

will spare my readers the five or six terms I =

coined.  I did want to mention my efforts lest =

anyone think I hadn't been =15everywhere=15 in literature =

as a taxonomist. =


Before leaving this chapter, I'd like to discuss one =

other poet, John M. Bennett, because his poetry, =

while xenolinguistic, is xenolinguistic in a way =

that strikes me as significantly different from the =

way most language poets' work is.  Bennett is also =

worth discussing simply as a severely under-rated =

otherstream poet.  So, let us turn now to, "The =

Eating," a characteristic poem of his from the =

collection he asked me to introduce, =15the Blur=15. It's =

on the next page. =


As in most of Bennett's poems, the subject matter of =

"The Eating" is commonplace, but at once, with the =

declaration of its title, a note of drama is =

injected: the poem is not to be about mere eating, =

but about =15the=15 eating, or a special, perhaps =

ritualistic act of eating.  Another source of drama =

is the beat of the verse (particularly as chanted by =

Bennett on the taped version of =15the Blur=15).  Many of =

the lines start with a strong verb whose first =

syllable is strongly accented, and anapests abound.  =

Other kinds of fancy-footedness which engage the ear =

and help bind the reader to matter not immediately =

accessible to the intellect include the near-rhyme =

of the first line's "Hoping" with the second line's =

"sleeping," and the full rhyme a little later of "I" =

with "my" as well as several instances of =

alliteration, assonance and consonance. =


   THE EATING

   Hoping for an end to the
   food I was sleeping next
   your breasts.  Raising your
   arms as in death, lamplight
   sinking into the wall till dark.  I
   hurried to the bank with the
   burn rising in my throat and my
   feet swallowed by shoes.  Not
   rubbed by yours cold nights or
   breathing my neck.  A heap of rugs damps the
   the basement and there's so much air in the
   waterpipes I'll never quench.  Today
   today.  A pile of steaks in a
   chair and nothing left to suffocate

The poem's narrative line starts a shade oddly: its =

speaker, who is--it is to be presumed--addressing =

his wife or girlfriend, is "hoping for an end to the =

food."  Apparently if something doesn't end it (such =

as--somehow--his sleeping next to someone), he would =

be powerless to refuse it.  So he is involved more =

in a feeding than an eating, a feeding he wants to =

end.  And as he is not sleeping next to his =

companion, but next to her =15breasts=15, it seems likely =

that we are back in an archetypal first feeding.  =

The speaker is hoping to break out of his infantile =

dependency on his mother, or a later substitute for =

her--such is one possible reading.  Overtones of =

sexual intimacy are heavily present, of course.  At =

the same time, however, there is a suggestion of =

alienation, of being next not to a person but to a =

mere part of her anatomy.  The situation, in short, =

is ambiguous. =


And things only get confuseder with the information =

that the woman's breasts are raising her arms, "as =

in death."  Or is it the speaker who is raising =

them?  In either case, how can the latter, being =

asleep, know about the arms?  Clearly we are--at =

least in part--not just watching somebody's sleep, =

but in it, cut off from conventional rationality.  =

We are in a piece of literary cubism, too--one in =

which many angles into a subject, temporal as well =

as spatial, are bound together into a single all-at-
once point of view. =


After a passage with a peculiar twist about =

lamplight which is =15sinking=15 into the wall rather than =

merely reflecting off it, all the urgency hitherto =

latent in the poet's voice and rhythm comes to the =

fore--but, as in so many of Bennett's poems, it is =

tied to the most commonplace of events, in this case =

=15going to the bank!=15  Why the speaker suddenly needs =

to go there is not indicated but probably to make =

some kind of withdrawal.  There is a "burn rising in =

(his) throat," so the withdrawal might be of water.  =

Or of more maternal milk. =


Or maybe he wants to make a deposit.  Perhaps the =

bank is his companion's womb, and the burn is rising =

in a lower throat than the one in his neck.  This =

might seem far-fetched, but the surrealistic non-
rationality of the poem encourages reader-
participation even into such far-fetchednesses, and =

this for me is one of its main virtues. =


The reader is participated even more intensely into =

the events of the poem when the speaker's feet are =

"swallowed by shoes."  Life is underfoot--and feels =

menacingly devouring.  The poem to this point verily =

has achieved an arresting & authentic portrayal from =

the inside of someone frantically striving for some =

nameless visceral necessity and being hugely =

opposed, even by his shoes. =


He is lonely, too, for his feet, according to lines =

8 and 9, are not rubbed by his companion's on cold =

nights (despite the nearness of her breasts)--nor =

does he enjoy her "breathing (his) neck."  He lacks =

footsy-affectionate companionship, that is, and =

mouth-to-mouth sexual desiredness.  And with the =

latter we are again in food-related matters, in =

eating as consuming as final full visceral animal =

primitive barbaric raging devouring of one's =

surround. =


Lines 8 & 9 aren't just about a certain deranged but =

archetypally important human state, however.  They =

also exemplify what is perhaps Bennett's highest =

virtue as a poet: =15his ability to deliver first-=15
=15degree beauty indirectly through intense treatment =15
=15of negative space=15.  By this I mean that Bennett =

tends often to describe something generally =

considered pisspuke-unlovely, and to do so with full =

dedication, thereby losing many a delicate reader, =

and gaining a reputation for negativity.  But the =

negativity frequently yields the healthiest of =

positives, as here it trips us into a fresh-textured =

appreciation of full sensual companionship, of =

having one's feet rubbed on cold nights by =

another's, and one's neck inhaled into full-sexed =

intimacy.  Bennett describes the good of existence =

by violently telling us what it isn't, which can no =

more fail to tell us as violently what it is than a =

thorough explanation of north can fail to teach us =

as thoroughly what south is. =


And the good divulged, because unexpected, stands =

all the taller in the senses, and because of the =

dark of what it has issued from, all the brighter.  =

Bennett's poetry, then, is a poetry of affirmation =

as much as the more clearly affirmative poetry =

of=FA.=FA.=FA. I can't think of any former poets of =

significance who were exclusively affirmative; their =

finest moments occur against darkness--e.g., what =

Shakespeare brings off among murders, suicides and =

ruin in =15Macbeth=15, or Shelley in the despondencies of =

his "Ode to the West Wind," or Roethke in all his =

presentations of madness and desolation.  In short, =

Bennett is not as untraditional as conservative =

critics might have you believe. =


His best moments are top drawer, too--for instance, =

what happens in line 10 where "(a) heap of rugs =

damps the basement."  This excellently demonstrates =

what I mean by a "nightmarriage," which is what I =

call any phrase which seems to me both a happy =

marriage of images and something out of a nightmare.  =

This particular one describes the suppression of =

menacing things in the speaker's basement.  Or it is =

the basement itself which is being suppressed--and =

if the speaker's shoes can swallow his feet, what =

couldn't his basement do?!  That's a striking enough =

image.  But in the context--which is part dream (or =

place in a mind), and part human body and its =

plumbing, as well as part literal house and its =

plumbing--the image bulges into all kinds of other =

possibilities.  Surely, for instance, all the fire =

in the sexual basement that the speaker's genitalia =

are is being stifled; and all the agitated cravings =

of his belly; and, in fact, all the potential noise =

and color and violence of his whole life's undermost =

needs and desires! =


By its end "The Eating" has itself become a =

monstrous nightmarriage, or system of =

nightmarriages.  Look at the way all its pipes and =

passageways, and all the items going somewhere =

through them toward guts or wombs or banks or =

basements, and all the processes these things =

suggest come together to form one gigantic over-
image of digestion, respiration, sexual intercourse, =

maternal nurturing, perception, economic =

intercourse, communication, engineering, and=FA.=FA.=FA. =

life.  And there is nothing left to suffocate.  Nor =

have I anything else to say about Bennett--or =

xenolinguistic poetry.

This obituary for Ed Dorn=20

*by James Campbell*

appeared in The Guardian
on Tuesday December 14, 1999
and on The Guardian website:
http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/obituaries/story/0%2C3604%2C114039%2C00.html

Edward Dorn=20

Poet rooted in the imagery of the
dispossessed, of working-class
America and the mythology of the
wild west=20

The American poet Edward Dorn, who has
died aged 70, had a loyal readership in
Britain, despite having published little in
this country for almost 25 years. He was
grouped with the Black Mountain poets -
named after the progressive college in
North Carolina - but unlike Charles Olson,
Robert Creeley and Robert Duncan, the
leading "black mountaineers", was not a
teacher at the college, only a student.=20

His poetry also stood apart from theirs in
being rooted in working-class politics and
a sense of wild western myth. A list of a
few of his many titles gives a hint of the
territory he occupied: Hands Up! Idaho
Out, High West Rendezvous, and the
most famous of them, Gunslinger.=20

Dorn was born in the prairie town of Villa
Grove, Illinois, on the banks of the
Embarras river, and was brought up
between there and Michigan. The
wanderlust was in his blood. He never
knew his father. His mother was of Dutch
ancestry, and his grandfather worked on
the railroad. Of his home town, he said:
"The first thing you're preoccupied with is
how to exist. If you stayed, you had to
have a pretty specific reason - you
couldn't just stay."=20

Dorn's means of escape was through
education: first, at the University of Illinois,
and then, in 1950 and again in 1954, at
Black Mountain College. He was taught
there by Charles Olson, author of the
Maximus Poems, a sprawling work in the
manner of Ezra Pound's Cantos and
William Carlos Williams's Paterson.
Olson inspired Dorn to conceive of
geography as the American subject, the
one from which all other subjects derived,
and indeed Dorn's first published book
(1960) was called What I See In The
Maximus Poems.=20

He even went to live in the fishing town of
Gloucester, which forms the background
to Olson's vast poem, and wrote poems of
his own there, published as From
Gloucester Out. Like several of Dorn's
books, it was first published in London, in
1964.=20

His early poems were explicitly about
working people: truck drivers, small
farmers, hunters. Among the earliest
poems he published was The Rick Of
Green Wood (1956), a lyrical verse with
an undertone derived from the English
ballads, about a meeting with a
woodcutter: "I don't/ want a rick of green
wood, I told him/ I want cherry or alder or
something strong/ and thin, or thick if dry,
but I don't/ want the green wood, my wife
would die."=20

Despite the advanced notions about life
and art which he encountered at Black
Mountain, and his later attempts to write a
poetry of ideas, Dorn's sympathies were
always with the dispossessed. In The
Debt My Mother Owed to Sears Roebuck,
he wrote of " the dust of the fields/ in her
eye, the only title she ever had to lands. "=20

Dorn's verse was inclined to be loose in
structure. He could say, without blinking,
that there was little difference between
poetry and prose, and even between
poetry and talk. His "talk" lacked the
economy of other speaking-voice poets -
such as Allen Ginsberg at his best, or the
minimalist Robert Creeley, who was
Dorn's examiner at Black Mountain
College.=20

But he was right to stay true to his
themes and his poetic voice. At the end of
the 1960s, he made his peace with the
cowboy, and began the poem which was
to make his name and grant him a status
equal to that of his older teachers.=20

Gunslinger I & 2 was published in Britain
by the late, lamented Fulcrum Press in
1970. It showed Dorn in a new mode, hip
and humorous, combining the iconic figure
of the old west with concepts drawn from
his readings in philosophy and science.
Just to stop his epic - there were to be
four books in all - from getting too serious,
he gave the gunslinger of the title a talking
horse, who was apt to roll a joint in the
middle of a conversation, introduced a
character called "I" in addition to the
first-person narrator, and put all his
characters at the service of a cabaret
owner called Miss Lil.=20

Dorn's relationship with England began
when he arrived to teach at the University
of Essex as a Fulbright lecturer in 1964.
His first marriage ended in divorce and he
married an Englishwoman, Jennifer
Dunbar, with whom he collaborated on
several projects. He soon made friends
among the standard-bearers of England's
alternative literary scene, such as the
poets Tom Raworth and JH Prynne (to
both of whom he dedicated his book The
North Atlantic Turbine), Tom Pickard, who
ran the Morden Tower in Newcastle, and
the publisher Stuart Montgomery, of
Fulcrum Press.=20

England, Dorn said, "set me on a new
course," but his politics sometimes
tempted him to take a hammer to
England's class system. In the long
poem, Oxford, he wrote: "The woman
opposite/ by no act other than Murder/ is
permitted existence." When he used the
same blunt in strument on his own
country - "the thorn in the throat of our
national hypocrisy" etc - the result was
effective neither as poetry nor as
rabble-rousing.=20

Politics and poetics were in a state of
constant interplay in Dorn's work. The
function of the poet in America, he said,
was to "stay as removed as possible from
all permanent associations with power".
As for the institutional prizes, such as the
National Book Award and the Pulitzer, his
words were: "Who cares?"=20

At a reading in London in late 1998 , Dorn,
clearly ill, gave a strange, mesmerising
performance, which was somewhere
between poetry, stand-up comedy and
personal tragedy. He prefaced each poem
with a long introduction, straying easily
from the point, and then, just as he had
the audience chuckling, would burst into
tears for no apparent reason.=20

The overall impression was of an almost
unbearable sensitivity. He treated the
listeners in the hall as he might have done
a group of friends invited to his home, and
this too could be seen as part of his
aesthetic. He once joked that he knew
"almost exactly how many readers I have,
and I even know a large percentage of
them personally".=20

Although populist in politics, Dorn was a
cult writer whose natural home was on the
fringe. Gunslinger would have baffled the
"chunky westerner" of whom he wrote in
Home On The Range, or the cowboy who
sings "Yi Yi" in Vaquero, another early
poem. While in his early days he too
worked by turning his hand to whatever
came along, from the mid-1960s onwards
he earned his living as a university teacher
in Kansas, Chicago, San Francisco and
Boulder, Colorado, among other places.=20

Dorn was remarkably prolific, turning out
chapbooks, pamphlets, magazines and
books which merged into other books.
Between the years 1968-72, for instance,
he published almost 20 titles of poetry,
fiction and non-fiction. With Prynne and
others, he issued Bean News, in which
journalism and poetry, fact and forgery
overlapped. More recently, he was
engaged in Languedoc Variorum: A
Defence Of Heresy And Heretics, a long
poem with a running prose com mentary,
which Etruscan Books, in Devon, have
been planning to publish in 2000.=20

His novel, By The Sound, appeared in
1971, and his Collected Poems in 1983.
In 1996 his High West Rendezvous was
published, and this year saw the
appearance of Sun Unwound, translations
with Gordon Brotherstone of Latin
American poetry.=20

Dorn's wife Jennifer, and their son and
daughter, survive him, as does his first
wife, and his stepson, stepdaughter and
son from that marriage.=20

Listmates, I apologize for responding to a b-c from Tom Raworth as though
it had been f-c to this List. What confused me was that the post was fwded
to me from another list-member, who had the day before fwded a post to her
from me, to the List. Assuming this was further to that public discussion
of events in Seattle, I screwed up. Sorry, Tom---although no cause that I
can see, for yr post not to become part of the public discussion. That
decision, however, is yours to make, not mine, and I regret any
embarrasment I may have caused. And thanks to Doug Lang, for his
well-merited rebuke. My face is redder than my armband. David

_Gunslinger_ made all a difference. It put scare quotes about the authentic
voice of Black Mtn and blazed a trail to the authenticity of a subsequent
time. A watershed work in the coyote wit of which, you'd be a dunderhead
not to take delight, and instruction.

But through his death considering the man, I am sent back to read the
poetry of a more vulnerable aspect, when the poet admitted to his faults.
Here's one from _The Newly Fallen_ , as it stands there rather than the
slightly revised version in the Collected :

Like a Message on a Sunday

Sits
    the forlorn plumber
by the river
with his daughter
    staring at the water
then, at her
his daughter closely.

Once World, he came
to our house to fix the stove
                  and couldn't
  oh, we were arrogant and talked
about him in the next room, doesn't
a man know what he is doing?

Can't it be done right,
       World of iron thorns.
Now they sit by the meager river
by the water . . . stare
into that plumber
so that I can see a daughter in the water
she thin and silent,
he, wearing a baseball cap
   in a celebrating town this summer season
may they live on

on, may their failure be kindly, and come
in small pieces.



David.

Not all the books listed for the New Yorker prize are awful. John Koethe
is a decent Ashbery imitator.  Louise Gluck is a fine poet if you like
that sort of thing. I have no doubt she will emerge victorious. And of
course Prynne. I forget what the other candidates are. Prizes and lists of
the best books of the century, etc..., like horoscopes, should be used
"for entertaiment purposes only." I have a hard time working up a moral
fervor about it! The New Yorker never had particularly great poetry,
though when Howard Moss was editor he published James Schuyler and the
like. It is interesting that even though the New Yorker changed from
upper-middle brow WASP John Cheever style culture to a sort of
upper-middle brow people magazine, the basic poetry it publishes remains
identical. But this is exactly what people used to read the old New Yorker
for.

Hi Rebecca,
> It seems to me that this same argument could be used to suggest that
affirmative action laws should be abolished.
With all due respect (and this email isn't about you, just this idea), this
doesn't strike me as a very good analogy, and indeed symptomatic of some
thinking on how poetry is intended to effect culture (when such intensions
are hinted at or stated).  The New Yorker is hardly Congress, nor is it
something one would think could be fetishized as "society" -- it's really a
very specific magazine for a specific group of people, even if it's a very
large group.  If you start imagining it as some avuncular entity, some sort
of big daddy (or mommy, either way) authority whose mind you hope to change,
then you get into trouble (not to mention the fact that the New Yorker can
go away, go bankrupt, if we want it to but society cannot).  As it is, the
New Yorker can change in a split second, as it did when Tina Brown took over
(she's gone, of course): in their first (or one of their first) issues after
she landed, there was a gorgeous full page picture of W.H. Auden in a long
overcoat in the snow staring, melancholic as it's possible to perceive
behind his drapes of wrinkles (here I'm getting belle-lettristic) with a
very long poem on the facing page, something like the In Praise of Limestone
but I can't remember exactly.  Now, anyone could have looked at that gesture
of hers as a "sign of something new" or a "change for the better" as if it
were on her hit list of cosmetic changes along wit Art Spieglman covers and
(was she responsible for this?) Peter Scheldahl.  I have, really, no idea
how she followed up that gesture though I don't remember too many more
photos of poets, nor better poetry, coming in it's wake.  What's striking is
that Auden, for whatever the readers of the New Yorker knew, could have just
as easily been described as a "Cambridge don" (of course he wasn't) -- in
other words, he's English, an amenable exotic, and despite his leftism and
flirtation with experimental poetics and, one might say, his homosexuality,
he wasn't threatening to the New Yorker readers sense of culture (he wrote
opera librettos, too) and their mastery over it.
Anyway, all I'm saying is that, in my opinion, there's no reason to even
want to change the New Yorker, nor to equate it with any sort of cultural
legitimacy in terms of what this loosely defined "we" are trying to do.  The
New Yorker will never spread a greater understanding of experimental poetics
unless they know how to sell it or assimilate it into whatever else it is
they sell (culture, events, opinion), which of course they won't (because of
idiots like us).  In that way, it's hardly a "ray of light" but a rather
wide swath of darkness -- not neutral even, but kind of negative (though on
any other day I'd say it's pretty neutral).  I think Prynne should win that
award, whatever the hell it is, because I can't get over how great some of
those poems are and that, in general over here, we don't know much about him
-- it's like Hopkins or Dickinson coming to light.  But it would be sad to
see that the first widely disseminated writing on Prynne would be a fluff
article in the New Yorker, but then again, if they print one of his poems,
Prynne seems prepared: his writing is almost armored against any easy
discursive assimilation, while being so formally crystalline as to not "go
gently" into the anonymity that the magazine seems to want to cloak its
authors in, not to mention the chummy garbage they'd probably want to spread
about him.
Ok, this all sounds terrible cynical.  Here's another example (my facts will
be all wrong here), an English one, which had to do with Iain Sinclair's
editing of the Palladin poetry series, which got books by folks like Allen
Fisher and Bill Griffiths into the "mainstream."  The books didn't sell all
that well, the publisher decided to stop the series and pulped the entire
print run -- not drop them in used book stores like, say, I do, or keep them
in their attics for posterity or whomever might be interested, just
destroyed them.  "Their" laws are just too different from "ours" in this
way.  Another example: David Lehman has to write a book on poetry, and
decides in the last chapter, while he had his moment behind the "bully
pulpit", to get out all his grumpiness on the charlatans he feels have
filled the shoes of immortals unjustly(one of his sestinas was rejected from
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, I hear).  He does this while answering a few calls,
changing the ribbon in his typewriter and listening to Rachmaninov (like his
heroes, right) -- in other words, here he is engaged in serious intellectual
activity that affects, in direct and indirect ways, great numbers of people,
and he doesn't care enough to think through his ideas, read any of the
literature, etc, or to even quote from it adequately (only in censure), but
has no scruples about weighing in with a moral judgment that, to those who
don't know better, can be taken for the general opinion on things (like,
"disco is out").  Ethics, ethics, ethics.  So I go to Montreal a few months
back and, trying to dig up some Earle Birney books (they didn't have them)
discover that the only book I can find of "New York school" poetry in the
stores in Lehman's!  The essential continuity, throughout these examples, is
that none of these central, big publishing outfits ever took the time to
care about the work they were presenting in an effort to be hip; it's all
very cynical and manipulative.
Which is why Prynne is great: he's only had one or two "trade" books and the
rest, I think, were small chapbooks; he doesn't write reviews far as I know,
and I think there is a kind of built in auto-critical aspect to his poems,
whereby they have very attractive, almost conservative (or "formal"),
surfaces (they even look good hanging on a wall from across the room) but
you can't simply breeze through them, follow the stately rhythms (they
change constantly) nor do you just wait for the good jokes or accept them as
some sort of "experience in language" -- his own little controversy with
McCaffery over language poetics seemed to center around this aspect of the
"play" of language, the semantic slippage, as providing a sort of ease for
the reader rather than the difficulty he wanted.  I think there's an ethical
dimension to his "difficulty" and that part of it has to do with this
relationship to other forms of literature -- mainstream, the media, whatever
-- that don't trouble you into thought.  It has a relationship to a variety
of things, actually, and I don't claim to understand them all.  But part of
the problem with these ideas of aesthetic merging -- i.e. lets break down
the walls of these aesthetic camps and just meet halfway -- is precisely
when it extends to places like the New Yorker, which has always been a
non-entity and should remain that way, and when it is not truly in the
service of a complexity of thought on these matters which, we agree, are so
important (and if "they" don't seem prepared or willing to keep up with
"us," that's not our concern).  The difference between two poor and ignored
"experimental" writers in New York who don't write like each other is
nothing compared to the difference between them and the writers that the New
Yorker habitually tends to; then again, if the difference between those two
(poor and ignored, etc.) writers is in their attitude to the New Yorker
(standing in for other cultural institutions) it may in fact be a big
difference and worth investigating.  A kind of thoughtless merging of
poetics tends to gloss over the fact that there are very particular
attitudes that some of these "radical" poets possess toward assimilation
into the dominant culture, that it isn't just a game to want to reject
certain types of identities and aesthetic closures, and that many of us feel
that we could write great poems for the New Yorker on any given day but
don't.
Artaud wrote that "all writing is pigshit," or something like that, and at
about the same time (the first half of the century) Brecht was giving an
important literary award to a poem about a local bicycling star (it was
called something like "Hey! hey! the Iron Man!" -- that's not even close but
something like that).  Why do people do things like this?  I don't know, but
a lot of us are still doing this very thing in more subtle ways today --
being "moral exhibitionists" in some quasi-nihilistic manner, and our art
and maybe in our lives -- and to think that it's because we are really
scratching at the doors of Culture wanting to get in is missing something
very important.  I couldn't see Prynne as a "ray of light" for the New
Yorker because, after all, he would refuse to go to their parties -- it's
part of him not to be this light.  "Good" gestures by the New Yorker confuse
the point, especially when they transcend the words and actions of those
they affect (in this case poets who aren't considered to possibly have
social powrer of their own), though then again probably brings it to a head.
Ah, the patronage issue again... 1930's anyone?
I feel like I missed an earlier point, which had to do with the initial
linking of social activism with changing the New Yorker, but if you graph
out what exactly the entities are in these respective exchanges perhaps
that's better -- use colored markers.  Well, but anyway, my apologies for
using your very short email for this William Blake moment, but I had some
free time today.
Cheers, Brian

Kathy Lou Schultz wrote, quoting Leonard Brink:

I found it a kinda compelling argument as is, so I was curious how it would
be rebutted. I imagine the "explanation or supporting argumentation" is as
follows: If you accept the premise that class etc. are "made out of
language" (i.e. ideologically/linguistically constructed; not "natural" but
products of our linguistic (and material) culture), then it does not
logically follow that everything linguistic has to do with class. (The
logical structure, which is the only point I was understanding Mr. Brink to
be making here, is the same as in the following: Curry is "made out of
ingredients." Cakes are made out of ingredients too. But it just doesn't
follow that cakes have anything to do with curry.)

I think the counterargument is to DENY that "class etc. are made out of
language but language is not made out of class etc." This, I take it, would
be Ms. Schultz's argument: intrinsic in any linguistic utterance is some
sort of tonal register or mark of class (and race? and gender?), so
ANYTHING made up of language, e.g. poems, is also "made up of" class.
That's a kind of compelling argument to me in the abstract, but when I
think about it I'm not sure what it could really mean -- what would the
Mark Of Class be, other than thematic content? -- so I'd appreciate some
"explanation or supporting argumentation" *here*.

The other three counterarguments in Ms. Schultz's post I find less compelling.

[1]
>I believe that attempting to divorce writing from its
>social/political contexts is dangerous. The act of
>pretending that writing isn't political results in support
>of dominant power relations.

I'm far from convinced that *thinking about writing* is ever all that
political, whether one thinks writing is class-based, not class-based, or
whatever. Maybe such thinking indirectly leads to political things (like
publishing different sorts of writers, or what have you), but it just as
often doesn't, and it's those other things, not the sitting around
thinking, that either support or don't support dominant power relations. In
any case, I imagine Mr. Brink would (to my mind more persuasively than in
his above argument) claim that supporting/combatting power relations isn't
necessarily poetics.

[2]
>I would suggest however
>that the privilege to ignore class issues is just that: a
>privilege.

True, but what exactly is wrong with that? Are you saying that living out a
"privileged" existence is automatically bad? We shouldn't think about
poetry because other people in the world are too poor/hungry? Or are you
saying that privilege = bad poetics (because it leaves stuff out)? But
everyone on this list is "privileged" -- it's a privilege to eat enough
square meals a day to live, it's a privilege to be literate, to have access
to a computer, to have been born -- so one's square meals (or having
learned to read or parents' sex life) have to be incorporated in one's
poems/poetics? Of course diet may well *be* relevant to poetics in some
cases, either because of biographical circumstances (Poet X writes really
short poems because he/she has only 2-minute breaks from his/her farming;
poet Y caught some mind-altering disease from poor diet) or because a poet
intentionally thematizes the issue in his/her poems. But that doesn't make
it universally relevant; Brink's point seems more plausible to me than
Schultz's implied point that "privilege" is NECESSARILY relevant to
poetics.

And as for my two cents, I don't mind "non-poetics" issues on the poetics
list (e.g. the Seattle WTO updates, Viequez (sp?), etc.). I'm not trying to
shut down any discussions here by saying they're "not really poetics." (I'm
actually trying to prod a better defense against Mr. Brink's argument.)


[3]

See above. Clearly there are some poets less amenable to "formal" readings,
and some poets more amenable to "formal" readings. I'm sure a "Who cares
about class" person could come up with a poet as obvious for his/her
position as Hunt is for Schultz's.

Curious what y'all think,
Damion Searls

I open up the computer and I find myself back in my old village, with the
same cowshit. Whiteness/Blackness/Brown-ness/Pink-ness/and all mess of
nesses, race, identity, ethnicity, whatever you want to call it. Let
poetry be poetry. It does not need a caste. I recall back in the
cobra-infested, mosquito-danced village in Nepal where I was born and
raised how, when a kid was born, the priest had the sole/soul authority to
name it. I am Hom not because my parents wanted me to be Hom but because
the priest decided so, because they got the credentials, not you not me.
And the last name always gives the caste which gives the nature. I
remember one day my mother telling me not to play with the children of
other caste.
Can we play now? Can all of us play, or do we have to have find out from
the priests how to judge? Do we first have to know the
caste/tribe/ethnicity/class/gender/color/sexual orientation/the dinner
they eat/how fat they are to "understand" their work? Yes I understand
it's helpful but to a very lesser degree. The typical people in my village
say, "Where the sun can't reach poets easily reach." (Ravi napugne thaonma
kavi pughchhan.) When I look in the face of poetry it does not know color,
race, bank account, etc.
So here I am on the World Wide Web reaching everybody's mouth in
cyberspace, all these poets from universities, especially America--The Big
Place, the House of the High Priest--and as we say in Nepal, it's Back To
Mangalamon!

best,
Hom.

Hi, Charles.

I'd visited The Guardian's website,
to see what they would say.  It's a
typically British view of any poet
or poetry that does not fit the prevailing,
rigid, and limiting model of what poetry
should be.

Terms like "cult writer" and "remarkably
prolific" are key phrases, showing the true
disdain that is in back of this condescending,
provincial guff.

Well, the hell with that.  It's been 27 years
since I left the UK, and it's so comforting
to know that little or nothing has changed,
except that there are even more committed,
accomplished poets there now, who can be ignored
by the mainstream, or dismissed as marginal,
or odd, or, god forbid, too much under the
American influence.

Dorn's influence and spirit will remain,
I trust.  Something for which I'm grateful.

Best regards,
Doug

Mime-Version: 1.0

Listmates, I must hove to and heave off, and shall leave the List for a
week. I have a tiny gift for you, I hope you enjoy, and it is


Quaint

(inspired by Mark Weiss' reply to a correspondent who found Freud
'quaint,'-- inspired by but having nothing to do with)


I like quaint. I like to cultivate quaint, to have quaint hanging round my
ardent gate, there is nothing like quaint. I look at a woman and I think
"quaint," and when this happens, I am always atttracted. Metaphorically
speaking, I would eat quaint for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Intellectually speaking, I wish to penetrate quaint. I want to know it back
to front and upside down and inside out and I have the equipment for the
task, I'm told.

Quaint is a spring day in the rain in England's Cotswold Hills, by the
bait-house, beside the marsh, at eleven standing beside your sister who is
sixteen inches taller, and thinking youd better not go to bed with her.
Quaint is not merely decorative. It fills with meaning and some it it
sticks. Quaint tells you, "Dont get any ideas," except, of course, the idea
that it's quaint. If I get up in the morning, it's thanks to quaint. I cant
recommend quaint highly enough.

I stay up late for quaint. I keep solemn watch for quaint, I abide its
coming, as things do to me. When people tell me, "Quaint is catching on too
fast and becoming common," I always agree. Because I think its a quaint
idea. I'm glad theres quaint enough to go around. Speaking, as we were, of
quaint, I double over, as though in pain. I look through my legs and have a
great view of quaint. One never gets over it not entirely. Your very
existence now is quaint.


David

As one who has studied some cognitive anthropology, I find this an
interesting thread. The fact that bookstores are changing the principles by
which they categorize this literature may reflect changes in the schematic
structures we ourselves use to categorize it.

Although it might be tempting to adopt a conspiracy-theory where bookstores'
systems are subverting our perceptions, this simply does not fit in with
their motive: to sell more books. On the other hand, creating a an
organizational structure which closely matches that of one's clients would
facilitate more effective navigation; in other words, people could find what
the want (and buy it) more easily and quickly.

A more fertile ground of inquiry would seem to be in considering how these
changes in categorization may relate to changes both in the field of poetics
and in mainstream society in general. Ethnopoetics and multiculturalism are
probably where I would start.

Here's one that is exclusively poetry, but it's mail and phone order, so I
don't know if it counts:

The Spring Church Book Company in Spring Church, Pennsylvania is a unique
place to get just about any poetry book in print--and many that aren't. The
toll-free number is 1-800-496-1262. The address is PO Box 127, Spring

Adding to the Dorn obituary Charles Bernstein forwarded yesterday this from
today's _The Independent_ (England), written by Tom Raworth.  It's
accompanied by a photograph of Dorn and a poem from _Hands Up!_ (1964), "A
=46ate of Unannounced Years."  Hoping that the editors at the _Chicago
Review_ won't mind, I'll also append a recent poem by Dorn published there
(45.2, 1999).

EDWARD DORN


With the death of Edward Dorn the United States loses not only one of its
finest poets but a rare critical intelligence and cultural commentator.
Edward Merton Dorn was born in rural Illinois at the start of the Great
Depression, in poverty.
He was educated in a one room schoolhouse, then High School (where he helped
on the local newspaper) and for two years at the University of Illinois. He
worked for a while at the Boeing plant in Seattle, returned to Illinois, and
through his art teacher Raymond Obermayr was directed towards Black Mountain
College in North Carolina where he arrived in the autumn of 1950.  In 1951
he  left and travelled to the Pacific Northwest, where he did manual work an=
d
met his first wife, Helene.  In late 1954 they returned to Black Mountain,
where he studied under Charles Olson (Dorn's first published work was the
pamphlet What I See in the Maximus Poems) and graduated in 1955 with Robert
Creeley as one of his examiners. After two years of further travel the
family settled in Washington state. Their life there, on the edge of
poverty, is vividly portrayed in Dorn's first prose book, The Rites of
Passage (later republished as By The Sound). By 1959 they were in New
Mexico, and at the end of 1961 moved to Pocatello, where Dorn taught at the
University of Idaho until the middle of 1965.
Donald Allen's anthology The New American Poetry (1960) included some of
Dorn's early poems, but his first book The Newly Fallen was not published
until 1961 by Amiri Baraka (then LeRoi Jones)'s Totem Press in New York.
Three years later the same press published Hands Up!  Poems from this
period, so clear, moving, unromantic and filled with the memories of his
hard early life -- On the Debt My Mother Owed to Sears RoeBuck, for example
--  echoed not only in the United States, but across the Atlantic.
In the summer of 1965 Dorn and the photographer Leroy Lucas collaborated on
The Shoshoneans: The People of the Basin Plateau -- a book too long
out-of-print which anticipated the now fashionable interest in all things
Native American, and gracefully left the  last words not to the authors, but
to Clyde Warrior, an activist.  That autumn, at the invitation of Donald
Davie, the family arrived in England where, with a year's break, Dorn was to
teach at the new University of Essex until 1970.
Dorn arrived already aware of the work of young British poets such as Tom
Pickard and Lee Harwood, and he had corresponded for some time with
J.H.Prynne ( who accompanied the Dorns on their trans-atlantic liner).  The
American poet Tom Clark was a graduate student at Essex and shared many of
Dorn's interests.   Creeley, Olson and other visitors passed through the
various flats and houses in Colchester and Wivenhoe.  On the faculty was
Gordon Brotherston, and Dorn began with him a series of collaborative
translations of Latin American poetry that continued for decades.  He met
Jennifer Dunbar, his second wife.  In London there was a lively small press
scene and Stuart and Deirdre Montgomerys' Fulcrum Press published two
collections of poems: Geography (1965), and The North Atlantic Turbine
(1967). And Dorn began to write Gunslinger, one of the major North American
long poems, first published as a sequence of books while in progress and
finally as one volume in 1975, the year after its completion.  Those years
saw the Dorns in Chicago, in Mexico, and, with occasional breaks, in San
=46rancisco. Dorn's early newspaper experience and his work in the Print Sho=
p
at Black Mountain combined in the tabloid Bean News, with contributions by
Prynne and other correspondents. His neighbour Holbrook Teter's old linotype
machine, held together with wire, produced the type for this, and for the
complete Gunslinger, while Teter's partner Michael Myers drew the elegant
cover for Recollections of Gran Apacher=EDa, Dorn's next book.
In the autumn of 1977 Dorn began to teach at the University of Colorado in
Boulder where, in 1980, he and his wife Jennifer started Rolling Stock
(motto: If it moves, print it!), a newspaper sized journal that encompassed
their many interests (including a delightful golf column by Nick Sedgwick)
and ran throughout the decade. Still happy to work with his hands he built
his own workroom with scrap timber. The academic world didn't escape his
pen... Captain Jack's Chaps  (1983), is an hilarious account of the MLA
conference in Houston,  and he ended the decade with Abhorrences (1990), a
collection of short, savage observations.
During his last years he continued to travel... in Montana, in Wyoming.. and
to write (even a Country and Western song) with undiminished energy.  An
exchange year teaching in the south of France, at Montpellier, sparked a new
interest in the Cathars and Simon de Montfort. It is thanks to Nicholas
Johnston's Etruscan Books  that some of his later work is in print in
Britain. Dorn suffered fools not at all, and sloppy thinking not for a
moment: a lonely position at the best of times, and one that made him almost
persona non grata in the current literary and academic climate of his

mind: "When I first read his work, in 1970, it changed my idea about what
poetry could be."

He died at home, in his own bed, with his family beside him, in the West: a
pure American who didn't go crazy.  Fools can sleep easier.

A Fate of Unannounced Years


I will have to pick my cluster of grapes
in this country,
after everyone else has gone
to Korcula or Spain.  It will be strange
here, walking through the parks, the folding
chairs gone, the meandering lovers
and old women in their Sunday hats gone;
an empty air, and a peaceful kind of rest.
=46inding myself in america
slowly walking around the deserted bandstand, waiting
for the decade, and the facetious new arrivals.

Tribe


My tribe was lowdown struggling day labor
Depression South Eastern
Illinois just before the southern hills start
to roll toward the coal country
where the east/west morainal ridges
of Wisconsin trash pile up
at the bottom of the prairie, socially
a far midwest recrudescence of Appalachia
my grandfather French Quebecois
Master pipefitter in the age of steam
Indian fifty percent, very French
who didn't derogate himself
as a breed, showed none of those tedious
tendentious tendencies.  Came down
from Chebanse, from the Illinois Central
in Iroquois County, to the Chicago &
Eastern Illinois line's division at Villa Grove
in one of the Twenties boomlets,
the last precipitous edges of the great devolvment

These forebears on my mother's side
owned a nice clapboard house in old town
where I was brought up off and on during
the intensity of the depression nomadism,
wandering work search, up and down
the bleak grit avenues of Flint, following
other exodus relatives, Belgian in-laws
from another French connexion
Michael Moore-land from the beginning
manmade poisons in the cattle feed way
before Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease and angry cows--
governments always conspire against
the population and sometimes
this is not even malice;
just nothing better to do.

I'm with the Kurds alright--
World Leaders can claim
what they want about terror,
even as they wholesale helicopter gunships
to the torturers--even as they lie like Clinton
and his crazy battle-axe Secretary of State.

But I'm as proud of my tribe as if I were a Kurd,
my pure Kentucky English great grandma--
it would take more paper
than I'll _ever have_ to express how guiltless
and justified I feel.

On the way in to work, i was reading the really lovely and useful new Roof
book, poetics@ ...... It collects posts from this list, and is superbly
edited by Joel K.

Herewith, scattered thoughts;  not especially deep.

1. Someone mentioned recently the oddness of producing a hardcopy, ol'
fashioned book from internet text... This is true, but once one is reading
it, it's clear that this is not unlike collecting essays or whatever:  on
one level it is primarily a *selection* function; i had read some of these
posts in the archive 3 or 3 and a half years ago, when first subscribed
myself to the List; but this volume focuses on certain threads in a
productive and helpful way ;  of course there are other interesting
levels, to the project of wrapping paper around the photons of the
cyber-nonplace.... But on the simplist level this is a helpful
thought-provoking project....

2. i was reading the long exchange between Ron Silliman and Steve Evans,
much of which i'd seen before on the archives, and it is one of the high
points in the history of the list;  this is the one where they somewhat
hesitantly designate two "generations" called G1 and G2 and discuss them.

3.  Among the main frames of reference in that particular exchange, is the
(in)famous Apex of the M manifesto, and the group behind it is a major
point of reference as well... Given the salience of that group and their
particular ideological framework at that time here on the list, i am
somewhat surprised to realize that that whole set of questions, and that
group qua group and their ideas about religion and spirituality in
relation to nonmainstream writing, so not seem to have had any further
public visibility.....  Maybe i just haven't been in the right places to
see it.... Can anyone enighten me about the further Adventures of the M???
It seems as though the rather abrupt disappearance of their flagship
magazine, after a pretty brief existence (i was told it was partly a
matter of losing the necessary funding, but the whole story was foggy to
me) caused their entire project to disappear like a cartoon magician....
Given the messianic tones of their self-presentation, this seems
peculiar...

4.  One of the main reflections occasioned by Joel's excellent book is,
that the list is rather feeble these days compared to times in the past; i
expect this to be fleeting:  it has gone thru peaks and valleys again and
again...But substantive (and fair and temperate) discussions of poetix
ideas have been less in evidence in the last 6 months than maybe anytime
i'm aware of.... Ideas are often tossed up, but there is very little solid
exchange and extended examination of poetics concerns........

5.  Much happens between Ron and Steve in relation to another topic, one
which Ron and many others have discussed at various times in other
contexts: whether younger poets (the so called "G2") is lacking in a
political or social dimension, and if so what that means... Their exchange
remians very rich and i recommend it to folks who have not seen it;  but
one thing does occur, which constitutes at least my personal perspective
on this issue:  as we've talked about on the list before, both Ron and
Barrett Watten have publicly questioned this depoliticization of the
nonmainstream project... But as someone whose poltical edge in my poetry
has always grown out of my concerns as an active socialist, it occurs to
me that in part these critiques get things backward:  If one is actively
engaged in building the left, then that is likely to influence the shape
and momentum of one's work as a poet... While socially critical poets and
poetics have often helped (in a limited way) to create and perpetuate
space for independent and rebellious thinking, it may be a little
simplistic to feel that a poetics with political goals and edges can live
by itself, without the poets having personal involvement with a real
left.... At any event, that is the way politics flows within my life:
being concerned with and involved with activism, sort of "comes first"
logically and existentially; that my poetry and my ideas about poetics are
socialist in nature, grows out of that... and doesn't seem all that
problematic, at least on one (admittedly simplistic) level, that is very
important as a day-to-day lived thing:  i live in a certain part of the
country;  i'm in love with a certain woman;  these things influence my
thinking and practice;  so does the fact that i am convinced of the need
for a total renovation of my society in an antiracist, feminist and
socialist direction.  Yes questions about the political function of form
get real complicated from that point on.... But when i read a superb
debate like that between RS and SE, about why younger poets are not as
social and political in their ideas and practice, as the wave of the
1970s, i feel that one part of the puzzle is: look to their lives, to
what's important to them day to day; ... it may be not only unrealistic,
but even undesireable, to ask poets to focus on politics only or mainly
*in their work* ... if they care about it in their lives, it seems likely
that it will find incarntions in their words...

Anyway, go read the book:  it is fun and functional....

In the early seventies I liked it (initially) when Bookstores identified
poets by "origin" - particularly new writing coming from new sources with
fresh &/or radical views (woman, black, Asian, Latino, etc.) and even did my
own book shelves something in that manner (Black Mountain, New York School,
Moderns, SF Bay Area (and all the various sub-groupings of that!)  African,
surrealists, etc.
But a few decade later (as good writers got more identified by their writing
rather than their group), I became pro-Alphabet I like the chance
associations. Baudelaire spine to spine with Ted Berrigan, etc. On the other
hand - when I go into out-of-print book search engines, one has to go to hell
and back through hundreds of books (so it seems) by Stephen Vincent Benet
before you find Stephen Vincent, as I remain.

a poetry without human-ness informing it?  take out all nesses & it gets
quite boring.

sad-ness that as an upper caste-er you cannot play with the lower
caste-er.  as though the rules, once again, impede the progress of the
upper castes.  a yuppie couple in san francisco moves into an industrial
"live/work" space and then begins to call the police to complain about the
noise.

perhaps what the sun can't reach (this is a more universal saying than you
might imagine for it exists in many Indian languages too--i've certainly
heard it in telugu) are the innards/nesses which you so easily dismiss.

Re Brian Stefans' intelligent post yesterday: If the New Yorker published
Prynne in great abundance, how would this be seen? After a while people
would say that Prynne had been co-opted, that "of course the New Yorker
publishes Prynne, but not the numerous other poets it should publish."
Just as the New Yorker has published Asbhery for the past twenty years.
This is not seen as a sign of the New Yorker's hipness, but, as it were,
of a certain lack of hipness of Ashbery himself--he's the sort of poet who
writes for the New Yorker. So there is a sort of Asbhery of the "right"
and an Asbhery of the "left." The Ashbery of Vendler and Bloom and the
Ashbery of Perloff, etc... Interestingly enough, one of the poets
nominated for this prize is John Koethe, an excellent poet though
derivative of the more accessible, New Yorker side of Ashbery.

Which brings me back to the Lehman book. Isn't it sort of the New York
school of the right that appears in this book? Lehman himself represents
the legacy of the New York school when filtered through an essentially
conservative viewpoint. for example the cute villanelle in that big Norton
Postmodern anthology...

Well it appears Silliman and Bernstein and all those old fogeys have
finally acheived historicity (or had it thrust on 'em)--

This text appears in the new catalog from Univeristy Press of New England:

"Founded in 1971, and internationally famous as the formost publisher of
scholarly work on Ezra Pound and the Pound tradition, National Poetry
Foundation is dedicated to publishing the language poets, Black Mountain

I was in a Borders the other day -- a poetry reading was my excuse -- looking
for a book on the Huns.  Lo, I found significant amounts of poetry in the
History section, which is subcategorized by time:  classical, below the Loeb
Classics Library, and next to that, Medieval Studies, etc.

Even Powell's is divided this way, but at least "the classics" are next to the
poetry.  Literary Theory, in the center of a u-shaped Literature section, had
some of the "missing" Philosophy.

I think it is ironic that ideas are being redivided by the "common" threads
people seek, but it is a significant marketing tool.

My mom reports that jobs in the classifieds used to be categorized "male" and
"female".

As for the Grolier, I went out of my way to get there the last time I was in
Boston, quickly grabbed a lot of stuff, and then Louisa was very disappointed,
since unbeknownst to me, there was a big 1/2 off sale.  Which led me to wonder,
if she didn't want to sell anything at a discount, why was she having a sale?

She will order by e-mail:

Kathy: Looks to me as if the fact that you're used to being "personally
attacked" for insisting on the importance of class issues in poetry has
left you a bit defensive. I'm not arguing for the 'divorce' of
sociopolitics and poetry -- I just don't think codependence is healthy.

And, for you and everyone else, just to clarify once again: the theme of
my original post wasn't "who cares about class" but "why is class the
main concern on a poetics list?" As I said in a private post to Kathy
(her original response was sent to me only and forwarded to the list a
day or so later; I didn't keep a copy of what I sent her privately, so I
must paraphrase): I completely agree that 'class/race/gender/blah blah
blah' does infuse the writing of everyone who writes.

But, as Leonard pointed out, if class is a part of poetics, it doesn't
follow that a discussion of class is automatically a discussion of
poetics, and focusing solely on class when discussing poetics is like
wearing blinkers -- they may be differently configured than the blinkers
of those who, in KLS' words, stick their "head in the sand, in effect
saying 'don't talk about things like racism that make me
uncomfortable,'" but they're still blinkers. To pick any one filter
through which all poems must be processed is extremely limiting -- to go
from the limitations of one particular class (e.g., the "administration
of culture") to an arena in which a poet's capital-c Class is the
primary concern when evaluating his or her work is barely an
improvement.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

\


Intelligent Life Screen Savers


I foresee, by 2020, the creation of fully implemented Intelligent Life
Screen Savers (ILSS); these work on hi-giga/low-terahertz desktop compu-
ters carrying efficient evolutionary programs; the carrying capacity of
the screen savers will be in gigahertz at a minimum. The ILSS will create
artificial life forms at a high rate of speed; evolution will guarantee
fast-forward generations flickering at, at least, a megahertz/second rate.
It should be possible for full consciousness to develop within the first
twenty minutes of standby; the life forms produced will perceive the ILSS
as a local homeland, worth defending - but such actions are always already
foreclosed by the desktop owner playing, for example, a game of chess on
the Internet, necessitating many minutes of intense concentration, fol-
lowed by a few furious mouse-clicks.

The user, by reactivating the screen and canceling the ILSS, will have
also eliminated those life-forms which have been created, living at high
speed, developing their own cultured environments, memoirs and histories.
Theories of inflationary universes might abound, only to be destroyed,
along with the rest of the cultural debris, in the split second the ILSS
retreats to the background, the clumsy programs interfacing with the
clumsy users.

However, it may also be possible for the ILSS only to go into quiescence,
saving such forms and environments from one active session to the next.
Surely the forms will learn methods of obscuring their tracks; like worms
or viruses, they will exist within the interstices of hard drives, until
the final crash. On the other hand, like Star Trek beaming, they may re-
constitute themselves across the Net, invisibly burrowing, reappearing
elsewhere, on other screens, other ILSS homelands, always on the run.

But I think not, and meditate on the fast-forward evolution and full con-
sciousness - development of whole cultures, economies, interactions - only
to be thwarted by the next insipid movement of the mouse, click of the
keyboard, new worlds lost forever ...

This weeks Small Press List is up & running @ duration press. Given
that the deadline for the next list would be New Years Day, I will be
giving this round a month's go. Therefore, the deadline for the next
posting will be January 14th. I will make announcements as time
approaches.

Best wishes to all for the coming year.

4: _Empedocles's Sandal_ by Habib Tengour, translated from the French by
Pierre Joris. Duration Press, Sausolito, 1999. $5.00
(http://www.durationpress.com)

Born in 1947 in Mostaganem, Eastern Algeria, raised on the Arab and Berber
voices of marketplace storytellers, Habib Tengour has lived between Algeria
and Paris ever since. Trained as an anthropologist and sociologist, he has
taught at universities in both countries, while emerging over the years as
one of the Maghreb's most forceful and visionary francophone poetic voices
of the post-colonial era. The work has the desire and intelligence to be
epic, or at least to invent narrative possibilities beyond the strictures of
the Western / French lyric tradition, in which his colonial childhood had
schooled him. Core to it is thus the ongoing invention of a Maghrebian space
for and of writing, the ongoing quest for the identification of such a space
and self. Besides a range of lyrical works - works that always stretch the
imagination of what the lyrical can be - such as Schistes de Tahmad 2
(1983), Tengour's main books are the narratives Le Vieux de la Montagne
(called a "Relation," 1983), the retelling of the story of that most famous
Arab triumvirate of Omar Khayyam, Hassan as-Sabbah and Nizam al-Mulk, Sultan
Galiev, (1985) and two prose narratives, L'Epreuve d l'arc (1990) and Gens
de Mosta (1997). His work has been translated into German and Italian.

I had hoped to be able to also announce that my translation of _Threadsuns_
by Paul Celan would be out from Sun&Moon, but at this point it would seem
that the book won't be ready before January/February 2000.

May you all have a happy fin-de-siècle!

Pierre

Dear Brian,

Geeez. Where to start. First: I see what you're saying.

And I agree with lots you said, or at least certainly agree that these are
good arguments as to how the affirmative action analogy is lame, and how it
is not to be assumed to be a good aim for any ray of light to give credence
to whatever power the New Yorker's poetry editor might wield. On the other
hand-and this is the not-so-big idea behind Fence, which I edit, and which
does attempt the kind of "aesthetic merging" that is by necessity and
intention superficial, in that it only entails juxtaposing poems on paper
inside a product-I also want poems that I like to have a wide audience.

The New Yorker has significance to me as a landmark--not cultural but
commercial--and irritant. My father reads the New Yorker. When my father
(tries to) talks to me about poetry, he talks about the last poem he read
in the New Yorker. A whole lot of people--the large constituency you spoke
of--try to read poems by reading what's in the New Yorker. I don't have
figures, but I do have the backlogged memory of dozens of frustrating
exchanges with general readers trying to engage by bringing up the New
Yorker in conversation when they hear that I write poetry. I am interested
in the general reader. So I just can't be interested in ignoring this
entity, or others like it. I am more interested in a hampered, handcuffed
attempt to engage with it, however much that may be inherently on its terms
rather than on terms of my own making. I do not make my home, write poetry,
nor have my job, family, circle of acquaintances,  etc., solely, or even
mostly, within the experimental poetry community. So if I want my poetry,
and the poetry I care about, etc., to be a part of my world--and I do--then
it's more fun for me to do what little actions I can (publishing, voting,
reading, whining about the bad poetry in the New Yorker) to bring other
people into contact with that poetry. I find the other model to be
gratuitously alienating, when I have already gone through the alienation
thing.

Alice Quinn (poetry ed. of New Yorker) has a subscription to Fence. Fence
is, among other things, an attempt to engage commercially with a
hypothetical general reader, and to introduce or make available to that
reader poetry--"experimental" and also just
tricky/challenging/idiosyncratic--that is otherwise "kept from" that reader
by systems already in place that take as starting points suggestions just
such as the one you make by implying that there can be no fruitful
interactions between these bodies of readers. Most interesting to me in
your response is this:

"A kind of thoughtless merging of poetics tends to gloss over the fact that
there are very particular attitudes that some of these "radical" poets
possess toward assimilation
into the dominant culture, that it isn't just a game to want to reject
certain types of identities and aesthetic closures, and that many of us
feel that we could write great poems for the New Yorker on any given day
but don't."

I'm really undecided and occasionally bemused over the question of whether
anything that is performed through the medium of poetry can have the effect
of picking someone up and setting them down outside the dominant culture.
It seems to me that we are all helplessly at play in the fields of the
dominant culture. That may be even more cynical than the suggestion that
"we" (those interested in certain kinds of poetry) ought to and must ignore
and be ignored by it or be swallowed and spit out as glib poetry Gap ads.
Luscious Jackson notwithstanding.

How's that for a heartfelt (though I hope not to be perceived as taking
your comments "personally" in the sense of taking affront; I appreciate
your engagement with the whole shmegeggy) reaction.

Subject: Prynne

Hi Rebecca,
> It seems to me that this same argument could be used to suggest that
affirmative action laws should be abolished.
With all due respect (and this email isn't about you, just this idea), this
doesn't strike me as a very good analogy, and indeed symptomatic of some
thinking on how poetry is intended to effect culture (when such intensions
are hinted at or stated).  The New Yorker is hardly Congress, nor is it
something one would think could be fetishized as "society" -- it's really a
very specific magazine for a specific group of people, even if it's a very
large group.  If you start imagining it as some avuncular entity, some sort
of big daddy (or mommy, either way) authority whose mind you hope to change,
then you get into trouble (not to mention the fact that the New Yorker can
go away, go bankrupt, if we want it to but society cannot).

But part of the problem with these ideas of aesthetic merging -- i.e. lets
break down
the walls of these aesthetic camps and just meet halfway -- is precisely
when it extends to places like the New Yorker, which has always been a
non-entity and should remain that way, and when it is not truly in the
service of a complexity of thought on these matters which, we agree, are so
important (and if "they" don't seem prepared or willing to keep up with
"us," that's not our concern).
As it is, the
New Yorker can change in a split second, as it did when Tina Brown took over
(she's gone, of course): in their first (or one of their first) issues after
she landed, there was a gorgeous full page picture of W.H. Auden in a long
overcoat in the snow staring, melancholic as it's possible to perceive
behind his drapes of wrinkles (here I'm getting belle-lettristic) with a
very long poem on the facing page, something like the In Praise of Limestone
but I can't remember exactly.  Now, anyone could have looked at that gesture
of hers as a "sign of something new" or a "change for the better" as if it
were on her hit list of cosmetic changes along wit Art Spieglman covers and
(was she responsible for this?) Peter Scheldahl.  I have, really, no idea
how she followed up that gesture though I don't remember too many more
photos of poets, nor better poetry, coming in it's wake.  What's striking is
that Auden, for whatever the readers of the New Yorker knew, could have just
as easily been described as a "Cambridge don" (of course he wasn't) -- in
other words, he's English, an amenable exotic, and despite his leftism and
flirtation with experimental poetics and, one might say, his homosexuality,
he wasn't threatening to the New Yorker readers sense of culture (he wrote
opera librettos, too) and their mastery over it.
Anyway, all I'm saying is that, in my opinion, there's no reason to even
want to change the New Yorker, nor to equate it with any sort of cultural
legitimacy in terms of what this loosely defined "we" are trying to do.  The
New Yorker will never spread a greater understanding of experimental poetics
unless they know how to sell it or assimilate it into whatever else it is
they sell (culture, events, opinion), which of course they won't (because of
idiots like us).  In that way, it's hardly a "ray of light" but a rather
wide swath of darkness -- not neutral even, but kind of negative (though on
any other day I'd say it's pretty neutral).  I think Prynne should win that
award, whatever the hell it is, because I can't get over how great some of
those poems are and that, in general over here, we don't know much about him
-- it's like Hopkins or Dickinson coming to light.  But it would be sad to
see that the first widely disseminated writing on Prynne would be a fluff
article in the New Yorker, but then again, if they print one of his poems,
Prynne seems prepared: his writing is almost armored against any easy
discursive assimilation, while being so formally crystalline as to not "go
gently" into the anonymity that the magazine seems to want to cloak its
authors in, not to mention the chummy garbage they'd probably want to spread
about him.
Ok, this all sounds terrible cynical.  Here's another example (my facts will
be all wrong here), an English one, which had to do with Iain Sinclair's
editing of the Palladin poetry series, which got books by folks like Allen
Fisher and Bill Griffiths into the "mainstream."  The books didn't sell all
that well, the publisher decided to stop the series and pulped the entire
print run -- not drop them in used book stores like, say, I do, or keep them
in their attics for posterity or whomever might be interested, just
destroyed them.  "Their" laws are just too different from "ours" in this
way.  Another example: David Lehman has to write a book on poetry, and
decides in the last chapter, while he had his moment behind the "bully
pulpit", to get out all his grumpiness on the charlatans he feels have
filled the shoes of immortals unjustly(one of his sestinas was rejected from
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, I hear).  He does this while answering a few calls,
changing the ribbon in his typewriter and listening to Rachmaninov (like his
heroes, right) -- in other words, here he is engaged in serious intellectual
activity that affects, in direct and indirect ways, great numbers of people,
and he doesn't care enough to think through his ideas, read any of the
literature, etc, or to even quote from it adequately (only in censure), but
has no scruples about weighing in with a moral judgment that, to those who
don't know better, can be taken for the general opinion on things (like,
"disco is out").  Ethics, ethics, ethics.  So I go to Montreal a few months
back and, trying to dig up some Earle Birney books (they didn't have them)
discover that the only book I can find of "New York school" poetry in the
stores in Lehman's!  The essential continuity, throughout these examples, is
that none of these central, big publishing outfits ever took the time to
care about the work they were presenting in an effort to be hip; it's all
very cynical and manipulative.
Which is why Prynne is great: he's only had one or two "trade" books and the
rest, I think, were small chapbooks; he doesn't write reviews far as I know,
and I think there is a kind of built in auto-critical aspect to his poems,
whereby they have very attractive, almost conservative (or "formal"),
surfaces (they even look good hanging on a wall from across the room) but
you can't simply breeze through them, follow the stately rhythms (they
change constantly) nor do you just wait for the good jokes or accept them as
some sort of "experience in language" -- his own little controversy with
McCaffery over language poetics seemed to center around this aspect of the
"play" of language, the semantic slippage, as providing a sort of ease for
the reader rather than the difficulty he wanted.  I think there's an ethical
dimension to his "difficulty" and that part of it has to do with this
relationship to other forms of literature -- mainstream, the media, whatever
-- that don't trouble you into thought.  It has a relationship to a variety
of things, actually, and I don't claim to understand them all.  But part of
the problem with these ideas of aesthetic merging -- i.e. lets break down
the walls of these aesthetic camps and just meet halfway -- is precisely
when it extends to places like the New Yorker, which has always been a
non-entity and should remain that way, and when it is not truly in the
service of a complexity of thought on these matters which, we agree, are so
important (and if "they" don't seem prepared or willing to keep up with
"us," that's not our concern).  The difference between two poor and ignored
"experimental" writers in New York who don't write like each other is
nothing compared to the difference between them and the writers that the New
Yorker habitually tends to; then again, if the difference between those two
(poor and ignored, etc.) writers is in their attitude to the New Yorker
(standing in for other cultural institutions) it may in fact be a big
difference and worth investigating.  A kind of thoughtless merging of
poetics tends to gloss over the fact that there are very particular
attitudes that some of these "radical" poets possess toward assimilation
into the dominant culture, that it isn't just a game to want to reject
certain types of identities and aesthetic closures, and that many of us feel
that we could write great poems for the New Yorker on any given day but
don't.
Artaud wrote that "all writing is pigshit," or something like that, and at
about the same time (the first half of the century) Brecht was giving an
important literary award to a poem about a local bicycling star (it was
called something like "Hey! hey! the Iron Man!" -- that's not even close but
something like that).  Why do people do things like this?  I don't know, but
a lot of us are still doing this very thing in more subtle ways today --
being "moral exhibitionists" in some quasi-nihilistic manner, and our art
and maybe in our lives -- and to think that it's because we are really
scratching at the doors of Culture wanting to get in is missing something
very important.  I couldn't see Prynne as a "ray of light" for the New
Yorker because, after all, he would refuse to go to their parties -- it's
part of him not to be this light.  "Good" gestures by the New Yorker confuse
the point, especially when they transcend the words and actions of those
they affect (in this case poets who aren't considered to possibly have
social powrer of their own), though then again probably brings it to a head.
Ah, the patronage issue again... 1930's anyone?
I feel like I missed an earlier point, which had to do with the initial
linking of social activism with changing the New Yorker, but if you graph
out what exactly the entities are in these respective exchanges perhaps
that's better -- use colored markers.  Well, but anyway, my apologies for
using your very short email for this William Blake moment, but I had some
free time today.
Cheers, Brian

My poem "about" snow, test marketing, and Vigdís Finnbogadóttir (the
former president of Iceland) is at the Poetry Daily site today:

http://www.poems.com/

and the title poem from Paul Hoover's TOTEM AND SHADOW (from yesterday)
is in the archives--click on "Previously on PD..." from that main page.

Somebody pointed me to a piece on British irony in _The Economist_:

http://www.economist.co.uk/editorial/freeforall/current/index_xm3604.html

Not sure whether that URL still works, but here's a bit (and I have the
rest if anybody wants me to post it):

"The British urge to puncture grandiose visions is captured in a
(possibly apocryphal) story about Sir Oliver Franks, when he was
Britain’s ambassador in Washington after the war. A journalist asked
leading ambassadors what they desired in the coming year. The
Russian ambassador mentioned the liberation of colonial peoples; the
French ambassador spoke of a new era of peace and international
co-operation. Sir Oliver expressed a desire for a small box of
crystallised fruit."

There's discussion of the supposed lack of irony in colonial outposts
(as perceived by our man in Manila or Bangkok).  So is irony a
post-imperial luxury, part of the "management of decline"?

Excerpts from Jeremy Prynne's eulogy, as it appeared in the Boulder Planet,
12/22/99. Bracketed comments by reporter Jim Sheeler:

"It is always sad when a voice you know falls silent, but there are some
voices who never fall silent. His voice will survive as long as his readers
draw breath and turn the pages of his work."

[Prynne stood over the site at Green Mountain Cemetery ... holding a rose
from another. The rose was flown in from Italy, taken from the grave of Ezra
Pound].

"We are here to pay our last respects to Ed Dorn. His profession, his task
and his calling was to be a poet. They are not so usual in this day and age.
His was a voice that was often angry. His words will continue to enrage as
long as there is power for people to be enraged ... He was impeccable in his
opposition. He was compelled never to take any shit from anyone ... Perhaps
I shouldn't use that word. But sometimes you have to use the right word."

_________________

Some of you may have seen this already as it was posted by Robert Kelly to
the British poets list. It bears repeating, however:

"Feeling simply, directly, sad about the death of Dorn, and testing one
memory against the other, to offer you something that might stand up to
the power of the news of him that came through from time to time, words
from divers winds of how he held himself aloft above his sickness,
wouldnt give it the time of day.

In 1972 or so I was poet in residence at Cal Tech, amongst the
scientists and anxious technocrats.  Ed Dorn came to read, and gave one
of his usual, wonderful, 24 minute assaults on the ordinary.  The format
permitted questions, and early on, a student I'd never met before asked,
with ill-concealed contempt for poets and their no doubt suppositious
theologies, "Mr Dorn, what do you believe in?"

Ed paused for a very long time, fifteen seconds perhaps, looking at the

Publisher's Weekly just published a review of the Roof Book's POETICS@:

     "the discussions of 'The Social Poem', of the controversy surrounding
     the lit-mag Apex of the M, and of gender in poetry and criticism,
     among
     others, are more exciting and brimming with ideas than almost any
     journalism or academic criticism. This collection will reward those
     readers diligent enough to meander among unfamiliar companions and
     notions, and makes a handy compendium of some of the more
     substantive goings-on for those in the know."

Hello

We should say quickly, and only because we're still receiving manuscripts,
that Angle magazine has folded...in half...and is no longer publishing. And
is defunct. Or no longer existing.

We'd like to thank all the lovely people who contributed to all five of the
issues.

The press still operates. New things to come. Maybe "Athletic Writing."

What do you say to that guttural cruller?

more from the Doctor - serration and the birth of language


there's a mark in the sky
there's a hole in my head
there are plants in the sky that are doubled
there's a spark in the fire
there's a bone in my foot
there are fields divided, quadrupled

i slide word to word, i fly way up high,
the signifier seems all too dead,
but i know in my mind that is troubled,
i'm decatecting, i knew, and it's dire,
in the midst of the root of the sign
in the wire,
where plains and mountains are peopled,
where mountains and people asserted
against tribes of the plain and their tablets

do you know what i mean when space is serrated,
signs rustle against one another,
codes are codes, signal loads, perforated
in the language-formation of the other

the analog smooths, integration's the rule
across details, chaos, fractal recursions,
while digital cuts, differentiation's the tool,
noise explodes, language codes in incursions

the serrated edge carries the meaning of grain
of the voice, of the sign foreclosing
on referent, in relation to body and pain,
in relation to fundamental disclosing

the tree has a branch always lending itself
across the metaphysical sheet of assertion,
self-organization lends tending, it's left
the rest of the flesh to inversion

serrations grasp and divide,
they hold themselves taut in defining,
meandering balks from side to side
the subtext always declining,
articulation is always reclining

serrations repeating gives meaning to text
against structured repetition in the real,
this bursts through desire, body and sex,
intercourse gives birth to the seal

let it go, serrated rhymes carry the words
to other spaces and places desired,
think of nested times, think foreclosing surds,
the tablets already are fired

A L Y R I C M A I L E R
Thomas Bell and Mike Kelleher are leading a project for the magazine a l
y r i c m a i l e r featuring work by themselves and Jim Rosenberg, Loss
Peque=F1o Glazier, Inna Kouper, Ted Warnell, Jim Andrews, Clemente Padin,
and miekal and on the poetics of the field. As Thomas says:

"In this context 'field' represents a space with height, width, and
depth, filled (or emptied) of words or pictures. The concept has a
history in 20th century poetics dating back to Futurism; is related to
Olson's Composition by Field, and Duncan's hermetic studies; and is the
space in which a true intertextuality might be imagined."

The nine participants start out with their own work and then write
toward the work of the others, re-writing and linking toward a loose net
or field of texts relating in their own and related ways to this notion
of the field.

Subject: Re: class stand
From: "Kathy Lou Schultz" <kathylou@worldnet.att.net>

Please, Katie, no one has suggested -- least of all me -- that anyone should
"focus solely on class when discussing poetics." The fact that you misread
my posts and the Poetics List in general to such a high degree that you
believe this to be the case, and that you make such statements as "ALL
ANYONE EVER TALKS ABOUT IS CLASS" and "It might be good for you to get off
your collective classes once in a while" indicates something akin to
defensiveness on your part. The fact that you still seem to believe that
discussing the "sociopolitics" of poetry is somehow separate from "formal"
issues suggests to me that you just aren't getting it. And whoever said that
I (or "we" the List) were focusing only on the "poet's class"? Why is it
personal? What about reading the text?
An example comes to mind here concerning critical practice: Houston's
Baker's Modernism and the Harlem Rennaisance. Baker argues persuasively that
the defining moment in African-American modernism is Booker T. Washington's
1895 address to the Negro exhibit of the Atlanta Cotton States and
International Exposition, which Baker reads as an enactment of the
performance of minstrelsy: "And it is, first and foremost, the mastery of
the minstrel mask by blacks that constitutes a primary move in Afro-American
discursive modernism" (17). This "mastery of form" is an example of radical
"back talk" for the African-American speaker/writer. In learning to
manipulate the dominant discursive practice -- which in this case was the
vernacular -- Washington negotiated an effective method of black speaking in
which to "talk back" to the oppressor. Therefore, use of "black vernacular"
or the "authentic voice" must be understood within is historical moment.
Indeed, the mastery of form had to take place in African-American literature
before what Baker calls the "deformation of mastery" could occur. I raise
this example because it is one in which lack of awareness and analysis of
the socio-politcal context of African-American writing would have made this
very astute argument impossible -- and it is an argument which is intimately
wedded to an analysis of form.

Date: Fri, 17 Dec 1999 07:57:21 PST

Mark,

I haven't seen the book yet, but hope to do so soon. You are of course
entirely correct that one needs to look to see what is important in people's
lives on a day-to-day basis (and the decay of the left over the past quarter
century has a lot to do with this). One thing that struck me about the WTO
actions in Seattle (beyond an enormous wave of nostalgia) was how similar it
all was to the 1960s -- what brought people together in great numbers was
something to which they objected (the WTO, the Viet Nam war). When you look
at what was/is positive in those various groups, you see lots (!) of
interesting projects that don't necessarily connect up with one another, and
sometimes can even barely speak to one another. A thorny old issue.

A second question that has been striking me of late has to do with one's
expectations from a "world of poetry" as one enters into it. In the 1960s,
when my generation "came of age" the landscape was very definitely defined
by the likes of Ginsberg, Olson, Duncan, Creeley, Spicer, Jones/Baraka,
Kyger, Levertov, Lowell, Hall, Plath, Sexton, etc. It was, in that sense, a
far simpler landscape. I think we expected the world to make sense in a way
that younger people today have no such illusions about. (Think of the 700
people on the Poetics List, for example. If every one of them were to
publish one book a year -- and there's no reason to think that the folks on
the list aren't doing something fairly close to that already, at least
statistically speaking -- who among us could even hope to read half, let
alone intuit an intelligible terrain out of such disparate information.)

Both of these thoughts have been driving me toward the idea that the local
is more important now than ever.

Ron

Re Brian Stefans' intelligent post yesterday: If the New Yorker published
Prynne in great abundance, how would this be seen? After a while people
would say that Prynne had been co-opted, that "of course the New Yorker
publishes Prynne, but not the numerous other poets it should publish."
Just as the New Yorker has published Asbhery for the past twenty years.
This is not seen as a sign of the New Yorker's hipness, but, as it were,
of a certain lack of hipness of Ashbery himself--he's the sort of poet who
writes for the New Yorker. So there is a sort of Asbhery of the "right"
and an Asbhery of the "left." The Ashbery of Vendler and Bloom and the
Ashbery of Perloff, etc... Interestingly enough, one of the poets

*********************************

The above is only partly true, at best.... Many folks on this list, folks
whose own work and taste are pretty darn anti-New Yorker (shall we say)
respect the hell out of J. Ashbery and his work..... And yes many of 'em
say (pretty accurately) that JA long ago became a kind of token, for that
mag, and for the conservative mainstream in general... I guess caring one
way or the other about the NYer itself, is kind of a waste of energy, a
kind of looking in the wrong direction.... But the post quoted above, from
Jonathan, may be a little on the harsh side:  many people do actually
realize that JA is not "the kind of poet who wrties for the New Yorker".
Even tho' he writes for the New Yorker!

A hearty thanks to everyone who showed up for the LUNGFULL! Magazine
release party earlier this month.  Thanks to those who read their work &
embodied the liveliness & perception that the magazine tries to capture.
Thanks also to those who came late or left early but still managed to come
despite the flu or all-consuming schedules.  Additional thanks to the two
people I chased down the street trying to retrieve the copies of the
magazines they stole & to others who managed more successfully to abscond
with Lungfull!s -- obviously I don't dig getting ripped off but if you NEED
poetry that bad, I appreciate your enthusiasm & who am I to stop you?
Larceny = the highest form of flattery.  Props in advance to everyone who
puts up poetry stickers around their neighborhood.  Vandalism = the second
highest form of flattery.  The event also shone a little light into the
dark shadow of the printer's bill, for which I & my kneecaps are grateful.


I was delighted at the turnout & the affability of both devout lyricists &
experimenters as they rubbed shoulders.  Anyone who couldn't make it but
would like a copy or two of their very own, here's how one can subscribe:
It's $13.90 for two issues, one year or a scant $27.80 for four issues, two
years.  Checks should be made out to Brendan Lorber rather than to
Lungfull! Magazine & sent to 126 east 4th Street #2, New York, NY 10003.
You can also just stop by Lungfull! World Headquarters at that address &
look for the editor in the window to the right of the stoop.  This issue
features forty writers & visual artists, among them Bill Berkson, Eileen
Myles, Indran Amirthanayagam, Tuli Kupferberg & Buck Downs.  Also Letters
to the Editor from the likes of Hoa Nguyen of Skanky Possum, Albert
DeSilver of The Owl Press, Chris McCreary of Ixnay, Eddie Berrigan of Log &
someone claiming to be Jewel.

Those who have had a chance to look over the latest issue, or were at the
event I'd love to hear what you think, good & bad, backchannel or front.

Yours,
Brendan Lorber

Leaving behind the cybersoap opera, Perihelion has matured into a fine

Agreed! I didn't mean to be harsh to Ashbery, whom I also "respect the
hell out of." All I meant to suggest was that the New Yorker, by
publishing Prynne in great quantities, would remain pretty much the same
magazine...

Hi Ron.


Remember those bumper stickers, "Think Globally, Act Locally." ? It seems to
me that, with mass communication and the net, local and global have become
cognate. In fact, a poem that rhapsodizes a particular place seems to me
like an Arthurian legend. Now Place exists only as myth. And where a myth
lurks, poetry sounds itself out.

Hi Ron.


Remember those bumper stickers, "Think Globally, Act Locally." ? It seems to
me that, with mass communication and the net, local and global have become
cognate. In fact, a poem that rhapsodizes a particular place seems to me
like an Arthurian legend. Now Place exists only as myth. And where a myth
lurks, poetry sounds itself out.

=====================================================================

As a novice to the "world" or the "local" of poetry, but a long standing
member in my personal surroundings of it, the conversation here is making me
wonder a bit. Does it truly have to be about epitomizing a certain standard?
I have to agree Joel, where the walls and fences are brought down, it leaves
a clear view of the color spectrum poetry creates on its own. No matter its
origin or its creator's origin.
But, why can it all not go hand in hand? Can one not stand on the corner
reciting verse to their neighbor one day, and send an email to the world the
next?
As a person not so concerned (for now) with whom and why they read my work
(as "local" it seems to be of late) I am indebted to the blur that "world"
and "local" has become. I am grateful for whatever email I receive from
whomever a thousand miles away that may have never known this little
Southern girl existed and to the acquaintance at my side offering a
"personal review" of my latest "local" idea.
But, Ron, as at some point we all become concerned to a certain degree of
who and why, it is a somber thought of the masses that must now be
"competed" against. Even now I feel as if I have walked into a tidal wave of
too much at once.

Thank you for the thoughts,

Heather Allen

I think Ron is right about the local.  If anything, Joel, Heather, the
internet is making clear the importance of proximity, the local.  why?  the
internet is frequently trying to _simulate_ the familiar, the local, and
it's just a myth of the familiar.  as Joel says, that's where poetry rests.
Agreed.

Personalized web pages or friendly e-mail just make things _seem_ personal
while the actual relationships are more distal than ever.

E-mail also creates the myth of the familiar.  I do not know you or anyone
else here better by virtue of e-mail.  There is no substitute for actual
proximity, for people in the flesh, for extralinguistic communication.

Autocracy lurks in the blurring of the real and the simulated.  (uh-oh, i'm
asking for it!)

As an example, have you ever met a "friendly" writer who turns out in person
to be a complete asshole?  Or vice-versa?  I am sure many of us have.  The
seemingly freindly chap, one who seems personal, warm, intimate, is not in
any way intimate or personal.  This is an early lesson for most readers.

Might be helpful if Ron amplified on a definition or his definition of the
"local." But picking up on a couple of other responses to this thread - when
someone is turning a corner in their SUV talking into a cellphone and I am in
the crosswalk - in order to possibly save my life (on the assumption that
driver is not really "here") - I have to use all my pedestrian power (eye
contact, a jump back and a slap on the hood) to bring that driver back into
the "local." Sometimes I believe that's the function - or one of them - of a
poem, at least a good "local" one.

Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

-


Internet Philosophy and Psychology -                              Jan. 00


This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net, and sent in the form of texts to various lists. The URL is:
http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt/ which is partially mirrored at
http://lists.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html. (The first
site includes some graphics, dhtml, The Case of the Real, etc.)

The changing nature of the email lists, Cybermind and Fiction-of-Philoso-
phy, to which the texts are sent individually, hides the full body of the
work; readers may not be aware of the continuity among them. The writing
may appear fragmented, created piecemeal, splintered from a non-existent
whole. On my end, the whole is evident, the texts extended into the lists,
part or transitional objects.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as total-
ity, restrain its diaphanous existence. Below is an updated introduction.

-----

The "Internet Text" currently constitutes around 80 files, or 3500 print-
ed pages. It began in 1994, and continues as an extended meditation on
cyberspace, expanding into 'wild theory' and literatures.

Almost all of the text is in the form of short-waves or long-waves. The
former are the individually-titled sections, written in a variety of sty-
les, at times referencing other writers/theorists. The sections are inter-
related; on occasion emanations appear, avatars possessing philosophical
or psychological import. They also create and problematize narrative sub-
structures within the work as a whole. Such are Julu, Alan, Jennifer, and
Nikuko, in particular. Overall, I'm concerned with virtual-real subjectiv-
ity and its manifestations, in relation to various philosophical issues.
Recently I've been working with body issues through consideration of ava-
tars and ballet (Nikuko and Doctor Leopold Konninger), as well as issues
of philosophy in general; some of this has been produced as a series of
videotapes through the Experimental Television Center in Owego, NY. I have
also been intensively working on a diary for trAce, the online writing
community; see the URLs below.

The long-waves are fuzzy thematics bearing on such issues as death, love,
virtual embodiment, the "granularity of the real," physical reality, com-
puter languages, and protocols. The waves weave throughout the text; the
resulting splits and convergences owe something to phenomenology, program-
ming, deconstruction, linguistics, prehistory, etc., as well as to the
domains of online worlds in relation to everyday realities.

I have used MUDS, MOOS, talkers, perl, d/html, qbasic, linux, emacs, Cu-
SeeMe, etc., all tending towards a future of being-and-writing, texts
which act and engage beyond traditional reading practices. Some of the
work emerges out of performative language such as computer programs which
_do_ things; some emerges out of interferences with these programs, or
conversations using internet applications that are activated one way or
another. And some of the work appears out of collaboration or video, the
latter with Azure Carter and Foofwa d'Imobilite, leading to another series
of texts.

There is no binarism in the texts, no series of definitive statements.
Virtuality is considered beyond the text- and web-scapes prevalent now.
The various issues of embodiment that will arrive with full-real VR are
already in embryonic existence, permitting the theorizing of present and
future sites, "spaces," nodes, and modalities of body/speech/community.

Please check the INDEX to find your way into the earlier body of the work.
The Case of the Real is a sustained work that may be the most useful text
of all. It is also helpful to read the first file, Net1.txt, and/or to
look at the latest files (le, lf, etc., which are still to be indexed) as
well. Skip around. The Index lists the files in which a particular topic
is described; you can then do a search on the file, or simply scroll down
(the files range in length from 30 to 50 pages in print). (Note: I have
stopped working on the index; for the later files, I suggest you skim.
Eventually, I need a site and a local search engine for the texts; at the
moment, I apologize for the awkwardness of it all.)

The texts may be distributed in any medium; please credit me. I would ap-
preciate in return any comments you may have.

I should mention you can find my collaborative activities at
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/writers/sondheim/index.htm and my conference
activities at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk - both as a result of my virtual
writer-in-residence with the Trace online writing community.

What world are we talking about? Perhaps there are as many worlds as there
are minds to perceive them.

"It is always hard like this, not having a/world,/to imagine one, to wall
whether in/or out, to build a kind of cage for the sake/of feeling the bars
around us, to give/shape to a world./And oh, it is always a world and not
the/world."  -William Bronk. From, "At Tikal"

I don't know where it came from, but I'd like to, because it sounds like the
inspiration for N. Mackey's ongoing prose work, "From a Broken Bottle
Perfume Still Emanates", the first two volumes being of course BEDOUIN
HORNBOOK and DJBOT BAGHOSTUS' RUN.

Perhaps Mr. Nielsen knows?

There were some people over there who had a dance. Some other people came
up. They were from the Turtle People. Two of them carried a shining thing
they saw in the water. Some women tried to shoot at it. One of them caught
it in her net. She brought it back. Some men at the dance tried to take
it. A bird landed on the net and it disappeared. The woman said, from now
on you will have this disease. She took the shining thing and put it in
the sky.

Just now finally reading Susan Gevirtz' _Black Box Cutaway_, a

the subtle and delicious glides from one frame of fresh landscape to
another--here from a ledge, there from inside-out, now there from down
below, now here from the fold of a curtain named eternity?  Bravo,

Someone e.mailed my poetry website with the message below.  Can anyone
help him?

December 29, 1999

I realize that this may not be the right forum to submit my request.  If
so, I apologize   maybe someone could direct me, and/or my inquiry
elsewhere.

I am trying to find a poem that I studied in elementary school, about 30
years ago.  I do not have the name of the poem, or the author, or even
the first or last line.  I recall that the poem was about school and it
was an analogy to life.  I cannot recall the exact wording of the poem
but it ends something like this:  "When all my lessons have been
learned, I shall put away my books and go home.  I will say =91Mother, I
have come home from school.=92"

Any suggestions as to the author, or title, so that I can track down
this poem, would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Tony Sebastian

Hi Rebecca,

Thanks for your comments.  You are right in what you say, in general: =
that our parents, uncles, priests, rabbis, books store clerks, computer =
literate younger sisters, golfer grandfathers, etc. (though perhaps not =
our taxi drivers, Armenian uncles, arctic explorer friends, Falun Gong =
enthusiasts, Romanian gymnists, hard-boiled prog rockers, jocks, =
suburbanite high school coke-addicts, Bush supporters, etc.) are going =
to get their poetry from the New Yorker.  And if you want to talk to =
those folks about poetry, the New Yorker poems are probably a good place =
to start -- at least in terms of cultural values (which are consistently =
expressed there), recent literary tradition, even general aesthetic =
qualities (and the weather in the Hamptons).  Why not?  My issues are =
really much simpler:

1. that Prynne is a terribly complex poet, and much of this complexity =
is centered around his successful (i.e. not nihilistic or reactionary) =
resistance to assimilation into "bourgeois" (I scare quote it since it's =
an antique term, in my view) culture.  (A good introduction to Prynne, =
I've recently discovered, is the first volume of Adorno's Notes to =
Poetry, especially the essay on "Valery's Deviations" and "Lyric Poetry =
and Society" -- not to be didactic, here, but I've never been able to =
write or talk about him very well, and that helped.)  The New Yorker, I =
feel, would fail to pay any attention to these qualities.  (I have mixed =
feelings about the Ashbery/Prynne connection -- I think Ashbery fits in =
quite well with the New Yorker, through his natural charm and calmness, =
though he is more mischievous than he lets on when in there.)

2. that unlike popular music culture, which is driven by money and, in a =
sense, the enthusiasm of "youth", but also by the generally asocial, =
anarchic, quasi-romantic fuck-it-all sub-life that many people, from =
nine-to-five stock brokers or Romanian gymnists, have, the New Yorker is =
not going to roll over, switch gears (and class loyalties) because of =
some sudden grass-roots interest in Prynne (or radical leftist poetry in =
general).  As Bernstein quite accurately wrote, mainstream poetry lacks =
the "edge" that popular culture has -- it's a phenomenon that's worth =
observing closely -- but paying lip-service to the "edge" that =
non-mainstream poetry really only destroys that edge, since unlike in =
music, you have to work a little bit to find it.  Perhaps it's =
unfortunate that there aren't as many "charismatic" figures in the =
poetry world as, purportedly, there once was -- thinking here perhaps of =
Eliot, Stein and Ginsberg -- but this creation of artificial =
interactions is unlikely to create it.  Did MTV's attention to the =
Nuyorican poets create any real interest in the "underground" scene?  I =
don't think so (can't really say) -- most of what I've read or heard =
about this, i.e. the opinions expressed on the subject (even Brian Eno =
writes about it in his 1995 Diaries) seems to suggest that the blurring =
of commerical and "counter-cultural" (another antique term) interests, =
only destroyed whatever efficacy the poetry had aesthetically and as =
cultural critique (or even as expressions of nihilism, romantic longing, =
etc. whatever rock music is supposed to do).  (Eno, consequently, would =
probably be interested in Language poetry, but I don't think the MTV =
thing made him think poetry in American was worth thinking about.)

My sense, based on what you write below, is that you are very interested =
in a wide variety of poetries, but are also interested in "spreading the =

Is there no way to not make this "superficial"?  While there is a lot of =
stuff going on in the States (and your magazine, I think, focuses =
primarily on English-language "literary" [i.e. page-based] stateside =
poetry), it doesn't seem to me that there's SO much that one need only =
deal with different types of poetry superficially.  For instance, you =
had a piece of prose and some poems by Molly Peacock, who is a "new =
formalist" (she's pretty good, as far as that kind of poetry goes -- as =
are Amy Clampitt and Anthony Hecht, in that category [though not part of =
the group, of course], though in general I think this movement pretty =
awful, especially the criticism) -- why not get something from her =
that's completely, radically "new formalist", i.e. as extreme in that =
direction as possible?  And, likewise, go extreme "language," extreme =
frenchy lyric, extreme gay narrative poetics, pidgin poetics, =
documentary poetics, projective this and concrete that?  If you are =
going into it thinking it's going to be superficial, then you really =
only circumscribe the idea of a lukewarm center -- any "edge" that you =
may have courted will be lost there, and by extension any interest (I =
feel).  It's like all those novels written by mildly telented authors =
who were trying to bank on the Pynchon craze many years ago -- you will =
never turn anyone on to literature by showing them "Come Sunday."  But =
of course you are the editor, so you know more about how people have =
read your magazine than me, and I don't doubt that Fence has introduced =
a number of new people to non-mainstream poetry.

>I don't have figures, but I do have the backlogged memory of dozens of =

Do these people like the poetry in the New Yorker?  If they did, then =
why didn't they take their interest a little further by investigating =
the books, and maybe other outlets, or somehow connect it to their =
interest in words that they acquired (I'm guessing) in listening to =
songs and watching movies?  Everybody has uttered, at least once in =
their life: "terrible screenplay."  I know what you mean here, of =
course.  My dad -- who is a big Bob Dylan fan, especially back in the =
day, and is a writer -- doesn't seem to connect with the words in any of =
the poems he reads there, or in the Nation or wherever else he comes =
across poetry (I know he spots them, because he always brought up some =
new Ashbery thing back when I was at Bard).  So basically what I mean =
is: isn't it clear that the New Yorker, along with its context, is a =
deadening force on poetry -- that it just doesn't get anyone very =
excited about anything?  Maybe that's why those conversations are so =
frustrating -- because of the false sense of knowledge that poetry in =
the New Yorker creates.

> I am interested in the general reader.

Aren't there other kinds of "general readers"?  New audiences?  If you =
are interested in the poetry and the value-systems inherent them, isn't =
it better to try to get this poetry read by people who may share some of =
the values (but who don't read poetry) then try to convert those, =
"hampered, handcuffed" as you are, who are knee-deep in their own rather =
satisfied (and why not?) existences?

> I find the other model to be gratuitously alienating, when I have =

Well!

I didn't write that that would be the case, myself -- you must be =
thinking of someone else.  The greater question, "ontological" if you =
well, is whether poetry can ever enlighten one about her own spiritual, =
social and material conditions -- i.e. can it open one's eyes, get past =
the illusions, make one want to live a little differently or live in =
general, etc.  One can be set quite easily "outside the dominant =
culture" -- every time you refuse to eat processed cheese you are =
outside the dominant culture (though if you just choose one processed =
cheese over another you are probably still in it -- sadly), which is to =
say that it's not a black and white thing, it's just that a series of =
decisions, ethically or out of a matter of survival, will probably put =
you head up against the "dominant culture", and once in that position, =
it might be nice to find that there are people making art especially for =
you (and not for "them") -- i.e. that you have been recognized in your =
doubts and frustrations by a "pure" entity, whether it be poem or poet.  =
The "dominant culture" as an abstraction is not very useful, of course, =
but we all feel it somehow, and art seems to me a good way to organize =
these feelings (not to mention a way to break through the prevalent =
self-concern that seems to be modus operandi that capitalism strives =
on.)  This is all very vague; I'm just trying to stress that this poetry =
which you feel is only read by those who "live, work, etc." in the =
experimental poetry community does actually have value for others =
outside of it, even if -- and I mean this -- it's in serious trouble =
right now in how to convey these values, or to make to make them =
enjoyable, aesthetically pleasing, necessary, etc.  (Luscious Jackson =
notwithstanding.)

Anyway, I hope you think I'm not just being "schmegeggy" or whatever you =
wrote about this whole thing -- I just think it's a problem that's of =
some interest to a lot of people.  Many writers do make life decisions =
based on how they are to crystallize their own thoughts on their poetry, =
on how they can live to write the poetry they want to write, etc., and =
yes these can lead one into holes, low readership, feelings of =
alienation and asocialability, etc. which feeds back into the poetry, =
though hopefully in a way that reveals something about one's own, and =
the general, situation.  Everybody wants to be paid for their work, and =
to be read by an appreciative audience.  But it's probably not a good =
feeling to be respected for something you didn't actually do, alas, and =
when what you did do becomes lost in the shuffle (your heresies against =
Guiliani, for instance, reappearing in some terrible Jay Leno monologue =
-- even Eno, who shares three of the same letters of his last name [and =
five of the first five of my first], hates Leno).  So it becomes rather =
frightening when you see "experimental" being coopted as some sort of =
cultural mass that can be affixed, superfically, to some larger cultural =
mass that, in the end, will not recognize it's values, or fail in any =
way to be illuminated by it -- then all the work seems lost.  Whether =
it's true that the work is, in fact, lost, who knows -- poetry sometimes =
takes a long time to make sense.

Well, getting late.  Cheers,

Brian

recent literary tradition, even general aesthetic qualities (and the =

simpler:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>1. that Prynne is a terribly complex =

of this complexity is centered around his successful (i.e. not =

reactionary) resistance to assimilation into "bourgeois" (I scare quote =
it since=20
it's an antique term, in my view) culture.&nbsp; (A good introduction to =
Prynne,=20
I've recently discovered, is the first volume of Adorno's Notes to =
Poetry,=20
especially the essay on "Valery's Deviations" and "Lyric Poetry and =
Society" --=20
not to be didactic, here, but I've never been able to write or talk =
about him=20
very well, and that helped.)&nbsp; The New Yorker, I feel, would fail to =
pay any=20
attention to these qualities.&nbsp; (I have mixed feelings about the=20
Ashbery/Prynne connection -- I think Ashbery fits in quite well with the =
New=20

mischievous=20
than he lets on when in there.)</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

many=20
people, from nine-to-five stock brokers or Romanian gymnists, have, the =

some sudden grass-roots interest in Prynne (or radical leftist poetry in =

"edge" that popular culture has -- it's a phenomenon that's worth =

closely -- but paying lip-service to the "edge" that non-mainstream =
poetry=20
really only destroys that edge, since unlike in music, you have to work =
a little=20
bit to find it.&nbsp; Perhaps it's unfortunate that there aren't as=20
many&nbsp;"charismatic" figures in the poetry world as, purportedly, =
there once=20
was -- thinking here perhaps of Eliot, Stein and Ginsberg -- but this =
creation=20
of artificial interactions is unlikely to create it.&nbsp; Did MTV's =
attention=20
to the Nuyorican poets create any real interest in the "underground"=20
scene?&nbsp; I don't think so (can't really say) -- most of what I've =

heard about this, i.e. the opinions expressed on the subject (even Brian =
Eno=20
writes about it in his 1995 Diaries) seems to suggest that the blurring =
of=20
commerical and "counter-cultural" (another antique term) interests, only =

destroyed whatever efficacy the poetry had aesthetically and as cultural =

critique (or even as expressions of nihilism, romantic longing, etc. =

rock music is supposed to do).&nbsp; (Eno, consequently, would probably =

isn't irony in the eye of the beholder?  and isn't irony only successful
if there is someone (to my way of thinking, the powers of authority, in
whatever guise they may take) doesn't get it?  i have a feeling that our
man in Bangkok didn't get it, not that there is no irony in the tropics.
it is always strange to me that how much irony gets tagged as a sign of
the decadent west (not that i don't mind a little decadence).  and this is
true of the left and the right (jeremiah purdy can stand for both types of
reaction: 1) as a sign of our moral decline (target of choice: _The
Simpsons_); 2) as a sign of our political fecklessness (target of choice:
Circus Clintonis)).

to me, rather, irony seems like the weapon of choice for the
disenfranchised. irony signals the limits of community while demonstrating
another community exists (those who do and do not get it).  sometimes this
all you have, though my experiences of this are more of the high school
clique variety than what Homi Bhabha calls "ambivalence" in colonial
discourse. i gather irony is at the heart of Henry Louis Gates' signifying
monkey. sure it can be deployed in "regressive" ways.  but if you
associate irony with the aristocracy, well then, that has hardly been a
hegemonic class for the last 200 years.  i will be bold and say that power
_never_ speaks ironically.  it may speak hypocritically (and as a resident
in post-WTO Seattle i can say i have a better appreciation for this
nuance), but power always means what it says.  perhaps the economist would
agree with this--not power, but power in decline speaks ironically.  but
my claim is that those who speak back to power often do so ironically. for
it is not only to speak to already constituted communities that one uses
irony, but also to speak to communities to come.

A Note on Time Zero and Sources for Nikuko and the Doctor


It is increasingly difficult to write about, from this distance and exter-
iority, Doctor Leopold Konninger, and Nikuko. They inhabit this and other
virtual worlds; they are also in stasis, a constant jarring of pirouette,
observance, sexuality, obsession. Even this text is forced into repetition
as a result - for example "Nikuko has all the time in the world" and what
that implies. For the reader, the texts, which necessarily abjure narra-
tive (for what could possibly happen when nothing can or does?), appear
stagnant - the reality is that each is a memorial or reminder of constancy
on the part of "the famous Russian ballet dancer and her Doctor."

I am placed inside (and hence stagnant/frozen) and outside (hence writing,
active) simultaneously - a paradoxical situation, since the writing pro-
ceeds, as it must, through diegesis, temporal unfolding - against the wall
of the Doctor and Nikuko. Yet, if I choose not to write, to remain silent
(as witnesses may remain silent), I am, for-myself, inauthentic in my re-
sponse - which is to _keep the Doctor and Nikuko before the public,_ to
allow the public to view, however mediated, the constancy that is the two
of them locked, as if in fatal sexual embrace.

Thus "at the risk of boring the reader," always a reminder, which is by
necessity a remainder, of Nikuko, more or less naked, more or less in her
pink tutu, more or less shaved, turning before Doctor Leopold Konninger,
more or less naked, more or less in his suit, top-hat and monocle (cane by
his side), more or less erect and spent, _as if by virtue of a hair._ And
that this image, from the imaginary imagination, equally spends itself
within you, the voyeur to their exhibitionism, reader to my writing (and
_that_ is where the dissymmetry emerges) - delineated by dreamwork, by ei-
detic imagery, by hypnagogic imagery, by imagery at the service of every-
day life.

Who is open to whom? For whom the pirouettes? Who, at long last, becomes
obsessive ballerina, and who watches himself or herself in what mirrors,
what _photography?_

Sources for Nikuko and Doctor Leopold Konninger


1. Chaucer, Merciles Beaute, I:

Your yen two wol slee me sodenly;
I may the beautee of hem not sustene,
So woundeth hit thourghout my herte kene.

And but your word wol helen hastily
My hertes wounde, while that hit is grene,
  Your yen two wol slee me sodenly;
  I may the beautee of hem not sustene.

Upon my trouthe I sey you feithfully
That ye ben of my lyf and deeth the quene;
For with my deeth the trouthe shal be sene.
  Your yen two wol slee me sodenly;
  I may the beautee of hem not sustene,
  So woundeth it thourghout my herte kene.

2. Sue Williams, Lacanian Ink 7, paragraphs 5-7

  Now she's beaten, sad and in pain... but she'll move on, will get out of
it, finally. Domineering? She'll give it a try--wear leather, high thin
heeled shoes, a whip, also may excel at verbal abuse.

  Now it's men: they come in by the hour, are very peculiar, want disgust-
ing things. They masturbate, scream--Mom, mom--while she urinates on them;
or they bring their own tutus to wear, their own ballet petticoats: "Aun-
tie Lady I've been bad, I need to be raped with a dildo..."

  Now she has power over the beasts.

3. Immanuel Kant, Universal History, first and second thesis:

All of a creature's natural capacities are destined to develop completely
and in conformity with their end. [...]

In man (as the sole rational creature on earth), those natural capacities
directed toward the use of his reason are to be completely developed only
in the species, not in the individual.

4. J.N. Adams, The Latin Sexual Vocabulary, page 126:

  _Irrumo_ in etymology reflects the popular obsession among Latin speak-
ers with a similarity felt between feeding and certain sexual practices.
It is a denominative of _ruma / rumis,_ 'teat,' and would originally have
meant 'put in the teat.' [...] _Irrumo_ and _fello_ describe the same type
of sexual act, but from different points of view: _irrumo_ from the view-
point of the active violator (= _mentulam in os inserere_), _fello_ from
that of the passive participant.

5. Hippocrates, Decorum, V., first part:

Wherefore resume each of the points mentioned, and transplant wisdom into
medicine and medicine into wisdom. For a physician who is a lover of wis-
dom is the equal of a god. Between wisdom and medicin there is no gulf
fixed; in fact medicine possesses all the qualities that make for wisdom.
It has disinterestedness, shamefastness, modesty, reserve, sound opinion,
judgment, quiet, pugnacity, purity, sententious speech, knowledge of the
things good and necessary for life, selling of that which cleanses, free-
dom from superstition, pre-excellence divine.

I got a posting from someone asking what everyone was reading now, at the
end of the century, which I thought was such a lovely idea, until I
realized that posting came from a different list I'm on. So I'm
introducing the idea here.  Bedside stacks, circa the flip of the nines to
zeros?

I'm particularly excited to answer this myself, since as I write I am also
trying to gather books to bring on a three-day hide-out in an Adirondack
cabin.  My house is stocked with books I bought in 99 and never had a
chance to read, so what to bring?

Possible selections include:
Journals I bought from SPD:  Volt, Big Allis, New American Writing, The
Hat, Fourteen Hills, American Letters & Commentary
Many new Barbara Guest books
The New American Poetry anthology I finally own
Wang Ping's Of Flesh and Spirit
French Symbolist Poetry anthology
New issue of Fence
Jena Osman's The Character
Plus novels I never got to read:  Everlasting Story of Nory by Baker, The
Saskiad by Hall
Pride & Prejudice, which sig oth and I are reading out loud to one another
nightly


Also coming:
ingredients for tofu/mushroom thai curry
champagne, bien sur!
the new Stephin Merritt/Dolly Parton/Beastie Boys cds
pancake mix
videos:  Modern Times (Chaplin), Rules of the Game (Renoir), 2001
(Kubrick), Irma Vep (Assayas), Philadelphia Story (Cukor)


noisemakers for everyone!  see you in the meltdown...

brian & rebecca thank you for yr comments.  let me just add to yr brilliant
exchange a few, perhaps tangential, remarks.

1.  mainstream poetry is fascinating to me in that it is, in several ways, in
a profound state of crisis, while simultaneously seeming to be incredibly
complacent (or "lukewarm" as brian puts it)--a crisis, in other words, as
much *of* as *in* complacency.  for the readers of mainstream poetry--& such
readers have, by definition, a casual relationship to poetry--poems are
almost entirely about "soul making" (thus, bill moyers)--& register the
(fairly circumscribed) dissastisfactions, aspirations, & values of the most
completely socialized segment of the american population (left-of-center,
suburban college-educated professionals).

2.  alternative poetries are not diametrically dissimilar to mainstream
poetry, but actually share/reproduce many of the symptoms of this
crisis-in-complacency.  this is not, however, necessarily a *bad* thing
inasmuch as it might be more useful & interesting for poetry to make the
symptoms of capitalism, etc. *exemplary* rather than to propose
"alternatives" or "solutions".

3.  for example, silliman's "solution" of a more locally-oriented poetic
strikes me actually as extremely, if unintentionally, conservative.  for one
thing, it would tend, of course, to leave in place the status quo ideological
& aesthetic assumptions of more ambitiously positioned poetries like language
(not coincidentally).  this is particularly evident for instance w/ the more
noticeably regional poetic groupings like apg--  which, although it produces
interesting work, is in an extremely unoriginal position vis langpo--or
boston, on the other hand, which is largely frozen in an olsonian aesthetic.
what exp poetry needs is in fact an "outside" -- an alternative, just for a
start, to all the *puffing* that constitutes the critical discourse (for what
it's worth) that surrounds it.  indeed, rather than the chaos of
proliferating books & presses, the reception of alt poetry & its relationship
to its audience seems more & more regulated by networks of affiliation
structured by a.) apprentiships by emerging poets to more established writers
& b.) accreditation/initiation in/by graduate writing &/or english depts at
buffalo, brown, naropa, san diego, etc.

4.  poetry, both mainstream & avant-garde, has become a minor genre in almost
every respect.  it is, for instance, telling that so few of the poets writing
in the contributors's notes of fence magazine, when prompted to name their
favorite books, mention poetry books.  even the way the word is pronounced
--po *em* --with the stress on the second syllable-- seems to attest to its
anachronism.  perhaps one could/should begin again by writing *pomes.*

more later perhaps. . . .

by the way, does kuszai's  _@poetics_ make any mention, in its introduction,
of the controversy that led to the change in the list's administration?  it
would be interesting to know, particularly as the particular circumstances of
this controversy render a lot of the rhetoric by perloff, bernstein & others
in lauding the list's initiation of various new freedoms a little hollow.
(see for instance kent johnson's "article" in _skanky possum_--i'm not
entirely in *his* camp either, but he does make several compelling points.)
in any case, @poetic's limitation to the 1st 2yrs of posts arose for
practical reasons i'm sure, but it also reflects what i think is the common
experience of its offering increasingly diminished returns to its subscribers
(while remaining, all the same, indispensable).  one suspects, too, that for
this reason, many of the formerly most interesting voices on the poetics list
correspond now mainly on the "shadowy" subpoetics list.  one would think,
too, that an intro to the buffalo list would--if only briefly or
provisionally--make mention, not only of new democratizing trends, but of the
new electronic heirarchies spun off from buffalo & embodied by, for example,
subpoetics.  if not, is this merely another example of the incestuous
critical discourse surrounding alt poetry?

Came back from the woods to this interesting discourse. So I thought I'd
come out of hiding to offer a small comment. I think that one of the things
left out of this discussion is that writing poetry -- in the sense of
really trying to enter the discourse and carry it forth in a way that
matters -- however a person might define "matter" -- is really difficult.
It's not an easy task. Polemic is easier, theory is a little easier, but to
write poetry -- well it's hard. I agree that there is an essential
conservatism in both the mainstream (and largely tedious) poetry and also
in the so called avant garde modes. What is to be discovered? What risked?
What commitments will we make?
What will we do that doesn't already have it's assumptions declared at the
outset? What are we willing to learn?

I don't have answers. But I do want to offer these questions as something
to chew on.

Happy New Year everyone

As always Jacques, you have so much to say that's so compelling, insightful.

I am just now starting to comprehend much of what you wrote, and find myself
nodding 'yes' in excitement.  but for a couple of things, as always is the
case with me.

the current concerns of many poets with categories of exclusion and
inclusion in the poetry community seems on its own to help impose a sort of
idiosyncratic class structure to the poetry community/poetry communities.  a
heuristic for stratification perhaps.  maybe this is what helps to feed, as
you say, "poetry, both mainstream & avant-garde, has become a minor genre in
almost every respect."

also, I might add that poetry in America weakens because poets are more and
more synonymous with dissidents in the USofA, and dissidents are less and
less tolerated, and there are large budgets to make this happen, perhaps
larger than ever.  the poets singing, "wake up," in eloquent ways, perhaps
find it hard to even ever afford a computer, a journal, books.  the only
true artists are terrorists perhaps (deLillo)?

<<for the readers of mainstream poetry, poems are almost entirely about
"soul making" & register the (fairly circumscribed) dissastisfactions,
aspirations, & values of the most completely socialized segment of the
american population (left-of-center, suburban college-educated
professionals).>>

please forgive me if this sounds out-of-line, but this feels as it if comes
from a priveleged person looking (down?) at the more common people
surrounding him/her on a college campus.  just my intuition, since I don't
know you nearly well enough.  (Forgive me for my lack of tact here.)

equating "soul making" with bill moyers cheapens the emotive power that
poetry can have, that poetry has almost lost, perhaps due to elliptic
writing, people afraid to say what they mean perhaps?  I don't know.
sometimes the ellipticism makes us take the scenic route to insights.

but maybe i don't know what you mean by "soul making."

writers with emotive power (what I am equating "soul making" with) are all
over the class map.  I think now of Linh Dinh, particularly his "The Dead."
a staggeringly brilliant and moving poem.  there is a sort of "soul making"
there, the author imparts his recognition of people's lives changing, and
his association of such change with death, and it leaves a chill, an echo of
foreign yet familiar recognitions.  his writing is out of the mainstream.
and yet it is so profoundly similar to Charles Simic's, particularly from
the "World Doesn't End" volume, and he's mainstream in a very large sense.
the breakdown is largely of social/professional associations/affiliations as
you say, but not really content or form any more.  again, as you say so
well.   the line between avant and mainstream is incredibly fuzzy, but for
the affiliations.  So I guess I am agreeing with most of your sentiments
except the one about the association of one small segment of a population
with Bill Moyers.  I think it undercuts your own otherwise terrific
insights.

<<for example, silliman's "solution" of a more locally-oriented poetic
strikes me actually as extremely, if unintentionally, conservative.>>

I take it as 1. a sort of survival stance in an increasingly divisive
literary environment in Amerika and 2. a sort of anarchistic stance, both
very radical and pragmatic (if such a combination is possiblem, which I
think yes).  organize locally (which need not be defined by geography alone
-- I live in NC and my brother lives in CA and yet I would consider him very
local to my life, as an example).

using APG as illustrative of the power of the local is unfair to the concept
of the local, and even unfair to APG.  Not that I have any friends there!
it is anecdotal, and another local group could spring up that's of an
aesthetic completely original to you (or me).  what they do may meet none of
my tastes or yours, but perhaps to dismiss them altogether and then
transitively dismiss local efforts is unfair?

<<what exp poetry needs is in fact an "outside" -- an alternative, just for
a start, to all the *puffing* that constitutes the critical discourse (for
what it's worth) that surrounds it.  indeed, rather than the chaos of
proliferating books & presses, the reception of alt poetry & its
relationship to its audience seems more & more regulated by networks of
affiliation structured by a.) apprentiships by emerging poets to more
established writers & b.) accreditation/initiation in/by graduate writing
&/or english depts at
buffalo, brown, naropa, san diego, etc.>>

I agree, poetry needs an outside.  networking, though, is such a product of
a capitalist coulture of quid pro quo.  how can poetry really emerge from an
environment of such backslapping?  and establishment by writing
programsperhaps my imagination is limited there.  but little of what i read
in journals, mainstream or avant, has that poetic chill.  poetry is rare,
rare, rare and yet common.  everyone has poetic moments, insights, so they
are as common as people, but it seems not many people have more than a small
number in a lifetime, and even less try to communicate those moments,
realizations, etc, and even less try repeadedly, doggedly, stubbornly.

on a final note, to the group, why is originality so important and craft so
unimportant?  Aren't both important?  Say, original non-New Formalist craft?
Other formalisms, shifting dynamic formalisms?  Is it possible to say
something that has never ever been said before?  especially when we know so
much of our reading has intercolated into our ways of thinking, that we
might find it hard to actually know from where our ideas "originated"?

goddamn, Jacques, what you said was certainly insightful.  as with the
discussion of Ashbery's "Girls...", Darger, outside art, from a while back.
Thanks for the nourishment.

Happy New Year
Patrick Herron

Death no parenthesis etc.

That levy was hounded to death by CoIntelPro - 15-year old girl wired to
record a reading he gave in a church basement!
That he came under investigation because he was a Grand BooHoo in the
Neo-American Church, a complete sham created to poke fun at organized
religion but whose pataphysical hierarchy gave FBI something to believe in
(this revealed for first time in Golden's intro).
That he refused to leave Cleveland.
The he had published 55 books at time of death (26).
That his poems are the sheerest yowl and shriek song descant of the 60s.
That his spirit of mimeo lives on in internet.
That B3CJMO is a super testament, with great gruppby repros and even color
collages.

My students at Bard couldn't get enough of him.

After years of battling against the image of die-young romantapoet, I'm

i assume that you are refering mainly to published poetries in this post,
and would like to add some thoughts and observations from the antipodes. i
have been reading beach's "poetic culture" lately and have been trying to
apply what i read of the experience in the usa with my own country.


At 05:07 PM 12/30/99 EST, you wrote:

in australia we are experiencing much the same thing, a crisis in published
poetry, oxford,penguin, uni. of queensland press suspending their
australian poetry lists, the audience is too small, print runs of 500-750
for a poetry volume are no longer viable for the mainstream. the readers
are poets and academics and fall into the same category of readership as
described above(i.e.left-of-center,suburban college-educated professionals).
many of australia's top mainstream poets are writing verse novels, dorothy
porter, les murray, and thus moving into a more lucrative field of fiction
novel.
the newer mainstream poets, lawrence, kinsella, and younger generation of
mainstream poets, like jordie albiston, catherine bateson, ian mcbryde,
corul hull, rebecca edwards, lisa bellear, and a host of graduates from
creative writing programs, are being published by the mainstream literary
journals which are still relatively financial and successful.
however the live reading/sounding of poetry at literary festivals
throughout australia has never been more active, festivals have never been
more active.
the live experiencing of literature seems to be growing at the inverse rate
to the decline in a reading audience. needless to say the newer mainstream
poets are also very good at presenting their work in public.

>inasmuch as it might be more useful & interesting for poetry to make the

>"alternatives" or "solutions".

again in australia, the non-mainstream press, is publishing poets, much the
same poets that the mainstream presses were publishing and a whole bunch of
poets aspiring to be published by the mainstream presses.
in these publications the poets take a more active role in the distribution
and sales of the book making the operation more financially viable. again
public appearance and performance aids book sales immensely.

what you haven't mentioned in your post, jacques, is a listening audience
for poetry, an audience that has come to poetry through live performance
venues. (like slammers and nuyorecan-style poets in the usa, and ravers and
ranters of the uk).
in australia there is another strata of the non-mainstream poets that don't
seek print publication, (but do occassionally get published), that have
through the eighties and nineties, established a career from the
performance of their work in public. myron lysenko, steven herrick, geoff
goodfellow, lauren williams, mark gliori, kerry scuffins, jenny boult,
steve holiday, and myself, (before selling out to the academy for a 9 to 5
job with holiday pay after fifteen years on the road as a performance poet).
their existence is proof enough that there is a listening audience for poetry.

Twenty years ago these three groups were politically and stylistically
opposed.
Unlike in the usa(re beach), the mainstream australian poetry was greatly
influenced by overseas theories of language, linguistics, marxism, and
psychoanalysis, and shunned the themes or concerns of university based
creative-writing programs which didn't really become part of academia until
the late eighties.
The small press poets were more interested in "real stories", lyric
narratives and experimental poetries(catching up with the avant-garde), and
trying to shake the mainstream establishment poetry.
Strangely enough this is the reverse situation to what beach describes in
the usa over the same period.
Interesting, the cultural implications here, american mainstream resists
french theory, australian mainstream, seeking recognition internationally,
embraces international theories of poetry.
The alternate scene in the usa embraces new french theorists that
mainstream has rejected, plus developing the work of homegrown usa
avant-garde groups.
The official alternate scene in australia followed the progress of the new
american poetry of the mainstream,ie ashbery etc, as well as the
alternative beats, language and multicultural poets.
The performance poetry scene was just taking off, (eric beach was probably
australia's first professional performance poet, he had a business card
which read, "eric beach, poet, no fixed address"), the poets union was
formed in each state and there was an active cafe/pub live scene which
produced poets who developed at performance venues, hearing and listening
to poetry, not in a workshop or in a library and not relating or even
knowing about the existence of the other two groups, let alone french,
american literary theorists. Poetry was blood-letting, concentrating on the
personal, political, psychological and everyday.

Today,in australia, the three groups do not differ a great deal in style
and content in their poetry, there has been much crossover and convergence
in the last twenty years.

Despite the differences, australian and usa present day experience, shows
that the publishing of poetry is in crisis, there isn't an audience that
wants to read poetry from a book. australian experience may cast doubt on
professor beach's conclusion that the writing program academy is at fault
for the drop in readership.
the australian experience would imply that making the poetry too ecclectic,
dare i say elitist, in their thematic concerns too tied up with a knowledge
of literary theory and not with the poem as artisic/aesthetic object, has
caused the decline of book reading audience.
however maybe it is neither, maybe the academies have just mapped two
different paths of many possible paths.
perhaps we have something to learn from looking at what we do have.

We have an active large and growing audience that likes to listen and to
experience poetry in person, in the flesh, to hear poetry being read,
recited, performed, uttered, projected, animated, call it what you will.

Perhaps the audience has changed, or is changing from the traditional
silent reading audience to an attentive listening participatory experience
of poetry.
perhaps we as people want to receive our poetry differently in 2000, 55
years after hiroshima.

Perhaps what is at fault here is that we don't look sideways sometimes.
how long have the language poets been seeking acknowlegement in the usa?
how long will the slammers be ignored as a poetic phenomenon of our age, or
the uk ranters and ravers, john cooper clarke, attila the stockbroker,
benjamin zephanaia, lenton quesi johnson, june binta breeze, or the
australian performance poets mentioned earlier?
We see poetry, but only a slither of the spectrum.

More than happy to answer this question as my first post to the list (':

various writings of Mikhail Bulgakov
the newly published collected fictions of J.L. Borges
     soon to add the collected poems
selected poems of T.S. Eliot
various readings from works by Keith and Rosemarie           Waldrop
Stein's Tender Buttons and Medit.
Miller's Sexus
Joyce's Wake
Various Pynchon
Collected Paul Celan
Tom Phillips
R. Silliman
plan to pick up some Eco on semiotics


So, reviewing the list, im feeling a bit ADD . . .
some titles and writers are constants and the list is far from complete if you include random reading of poetry, prose, and non-fictions

as a side note, an introduction of myself may be appropriate, i hail from Atlanta and fraternize with the Atlanta Poets Group and as a further note, i plan on moving to Sacramento come next September, if any have info. on art and culture, living, etc. on the area, it would be greatly appreciated

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

For those of you who may be teaching philosophy, or poetry & philosophy, or
others --

My father-in-law has expressed a recent interest in reading philosophy,
perhaps partly influenced by his advancing age and brushes with health
problems in the last year. He has not read much philosophy or literature in
the past, but is an intelligent reader. He also has a birthday coming up.

So I would like to give him one or two basic books or introductions to
philosophy -- maybe one to the history of philosophy and one to 20th
century philosophy; from there he can read individual authors' works as he
wishes. But I really don't know of any great introductory books in this
field. From some web searching I have found the following titles --

Introduction to Philosophy : Classical and Contemporary Readings
by John Perry (Editor), Michael Bratman (Editor)

What Does It All Mean : a Very Short Introduction to Philosophy
by Thomas Nagel

The Great Philosophers : An Introduction to Western Philosophy
by Bryan Magee

Does the Center Hold? : An Introduction to Western Philosophy
by Donald Palmer

Does anyone have any recommendations or anti-recommendations for these or
any other related books?

thanks to all for any advice whatsoever,
and best wishes to all on this new year's eve, which is my first day
backon the poetics list in many many months,

charles

Subtext continues its monthly series of experimental writing with readings
by Jen Hofer and Bryant Mason on Wednesday, January 5, 2000 at the Richard
Hugo House.  Suggested donations for admission are $5 at the door on the
evening of the performance.

Jen Hofer is a poet and translator originally from the San Francisco Bay
Area. She currently lives in Mexico City, where she is editing and
translating an anthology of contemporary poetry by Mexican women that will
be co-published by University of Pittsburgh Press and Hotel Ambosmundos
Press. Her translations and poems can be found in recent or shortly
forthcoming issues of Explosive, Facture, Kenning, Rhizome, Skanky Possum
and in her a+bend press chapbook as far as.  Recently, she and her fiddle
have joined forces with the visual artist Melissa Dyne, forming Groundzero
Telesonic Outfit International.

Bryant Mason is a long time member of the Subtext collective. His work has
been variously described as "lightheartedly paranormal" and "born of an
almost religious fervor."  He promises to leave his Ukulele at home.

Also this January, a special pre-reading event: Subtext's "silent open mic."
A full twenty minutes before the reading you will experience a multi-media
slide show extravaganza that incorporates projected texts, images, and the
anonymous sounds of DJ Yum Yum. For more information about the slide show
and how to submit art and text, e-mail <subslideshow@hotmail.com>.

Look to the future, Subtext presents Bay Area poet Carla Harryman on
February 2nd. Also reading will be Jeanne Heuving.

Subtext readings fall on the 1st Wednesday of the month at the Richard Hugo
House.  The Hugo House is located at 1634 11th Ave on Capitol Hill in
Seattle. Subtext events are co-sponsored by the Richard Hugo House.

Hi,

Unless Bryant moved further than just across the street last month,
This reading is in Seattle where he works with the Subtext
collective, rather than in BC.

Bests,

Herb

Of course I knew

It started in New York
City when that ball
landed
at Times Square,
and bounced
hour by hour
west to San Francisco.

I never imagined time
rolling 'round the Earth
on the edge
of a shadow
pushing the new
incessantly
west from Kiribati.

This what are you reading right now business shows up on this list about
three times a year.

I am always amazed that most respondees are reading eight or ten books at
once. I just cant handle that many at once. At the moment I am reading D.G.
Jones's new book of poems entitled _Grounding Sight_ and Beckett's
_Eleuthera_.
