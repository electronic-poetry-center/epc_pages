I've got an index poem called "Glenn Gould, the Life and Times of."
Backchannel me your email address, and I'll send you a copy if
you're interested in seeing it. It was in *Synaesthetic* 2, if you've
got that.

It's undeniable that Zukofsky used the index as an artistic
form in "A" -- in its early manifestations he only indexed
articles ("an","the"), and later he compiled an extensive
"Index of Names & Objects" that serves as a map to the poem.

Your question also makes me think of Peter Gizzi's
fine Ode: Salute to the New York School, published in Chain
4. Here the bibliography is an important component -- not
an index, although the listings are indexed to lines in the
poem.

By the time this reaches the list, I expect several will have chimed in
with Zukofsky's marvelous index to "A", with its entries for "wrist,"
"thought," "tohuy bohu" etc.

Not to be overlooked is the index to David Bromige's RED HATS --

Ron & Listerologists. Aha. Thanks.  Nash is clever...but not profound.  One
thing about the
L=A=N=G movement was its intense study (actual or implied) of language:
which is an extension of what Bill Manhire (he's actualy not as bad as I
painted him!) does in his creative writing courses: but its an
extension...like Hopkins was pushing things and later Olson and Creeley and
before that Dickinson:in NZ the original was Kendrick Smithyman  (A Curnow
was a great mod-pstmodernist poet altho he hated being categorised I think
(llike us all)) But Smithyman had an original gritty style which is
unaggressively  Aotearoan and also innovative (while his wife Mary Stanley
write - quite sincerely beautiful poems they advance me no where..how do I
put this?...)..But Smithyman ranges in a poem and he's talking about a place
(and of course he's  "in" his own mind and so on) but then he's  in England
(some parallel to what he's saying) and he leaves it for the reader to
decipher, and he_has_ got something to say    .. I dont konw if Graham has:
put simply he was/is one of the gretest poets worldwide and
innovative...but not much interested in Lanpo I dont think (if much aware
..although his knowledge was very extensive):  but the point is he (like
Manhire but possibly in a more self-consciously analytical way) was alert to
language and every thing around: different poets not better: but what I
gained
from Langpo was the sense that there were people very seriously (there's a
danger of becoming too dour about it all of course) and intensely into even
grammatical meanings and shades and the meaning of what and why wordsand
sentences are there or  not ...of course others go into that from
grammatical and linguistic study and quite different poetry - or look back
continuously to the past for models (analyse it maybe too much) . The
different poetry is good, or can be, but the complete rejection eg of
Coolidge's "Polaroid" is unproductive: in some ways its a study of
prepositions (my daughter's "coaching" me to teach English as a second
language and she said prepare something round the prepositions of time -
now, I need to know what and why they are (basically at least) but the
student just needs practice - but in the course of looking into (book on
grammar orig by Greenbaum) - suddenly there is a strangeness as a I
concentrate on these words - suddenly I dont know as much as I thought about
my own language (paradoxically and interestingly because I use it - hence
dont normally need to know it per se).....but that concentration non detail
and technique (while not the whole thing and not always exciting) is still
in a deep sense a homage to the language which a poet or truth generator or
maker needs at least  to have  some reverence fr: without as ai said
becomeing too po about te whole thing.  So Nash, Betjeman, etc  have their
place (although I supse theirovert politics might not agree me with (!)
......... henceI circling back: i dont tink that the  "great" poets get
recognised enough....its a typical phenomena with innovative and interesting
writing. Stein, not Eliot eg, should have got the Nobel prics. Some
thoughts, Richard.

Slought Networks presents a digitized version of Fred Wah^Òs recordings of
the 1963 Vancouver Poetry Conference, as well as select readings and
lectures (1961-67) from Wah's collection.

>> http://slought.net/toc/Vancouver1963/


-----------------
Online recordings available by the following poets:

Margaret Avison, Basil Bunting, Robert Creeley, Fielding Dawson, Ed Dorn,
Robert Duncan, Gerry Gilbert, Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov, Charles
Olson, George Oppen, Gael Turnbull, John Wieners, Philip Whalen

>> http://slought.net/toc/Vancouver1963/


-----------------
"The July-August 1963 Poetry Conference in Vancouver spanned three weeks
and involved about sixty people who had registered for a program of
discussions, workshops, lectures, and readings designed by Warren Tallman
and Robert Creeley as a summer course at the University of B.C. Warren
asked me to tape the morning discussions and the evening lectures and
readings. The workshops were not recorded, except by individual journals
(see _Olson; The Journal of the Charles Olson Archives_, Number 4, Fall
1975). I recorded 4-track, 3 3/4 ips, on a Wollensak, using one
microphone. I made copies of the tapes twice, once for SUNY-Buffalo and
once for Simon Fraser University. Some of the tapes have been transcribed
(see Olson, as above).

With the help of Aaron Levy, I am archiving some parts of my tape
collection. Though the primary reason for this is to preserve rather old
reel-to-reel taped events, I would also like to make this material
available to educators, researchers, and poets."

CALL FOR POETRY SUBMISSIONS

parlorgames is a San Francisco-based publication dedicated to what is =
new and true in contemporary poetry.  All styles are welcome, with =
preference given to poems that pull rabbits from their hats, enter a =
doorway as if it were an opening for rhapsody, and, in the end, take the =
tops off of our heads.

We will be reading submissions March 21-April 30.

Unsolicited manuscripts will not be returned unless accompanied by a =
SASE.

The versatile and talented HANK LAZER, poet, critic, and editor has been on
the forefront of experimental poetry for the last three decades.  His books
include Doublespace: Poems 1971-1989, INTER(IR)RUPTIONS, Mouth to Mouth,
Negation, Three of Ten, Early Days of the Lang Dynasty, and now his
eagerly-awaited collection, Days.  In addition, Lazer is the author of essays
on modern and contemporary poetry, including Opposing Poetries, as well as
other influential books of criticism, and co-editor with Charles Bernstein of
the Modern and Contemporary Poetics series, published by University of
Alabama Press where he is Professor of English and Assistant Vice President
for Undergraduate Programs and Services.

The significant and innovative poet RON SILLIMAN has at different times
in his life worked as a prison and tenant organizer, lobbyist, teacher,
collegeadministrator, editor of Socialist Review, and a marketeer in the
computer
industry.  Long considered a national leader of the Language-centered
writing movement, Ron Silliman's poetry and criticism have influenced an
entiregeneration of poets. His concept of the New Sentence spawned literally
dozens of efforts based on his idea of prose writing.  He is the author of
over 20 books of poetry, criticism, and has edited several literary
collections. He
has received several awards including a Pew fellowship for his work.

Novelist, journalist, poet, and satirist ISHMAEL REED is the author of more
than 20 books, including novels, essays, plays, and poetry, and has been the
recipient of a MacArthur Genius and Lila Wallace Foundation Award. He has
been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and was twice nominated for the
National
Book Award. Reed has taught at Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth and has long been
on the faculty at UC-Berkeley. Reed's 1972 novel Mumbo Jumbo presented a
counter-mythology, dubbed "HooDooism," that challenged the myth that Western
culture must be glorified at the expense of all other cultures. He is founder
of the Before Columbus Foundation, a nonprofit organization established to
promote American multicultural literature. Reed is well known for using
satire and parody to emphasize and advocate the importance of all cultures,
rather than the dominance of one.

Maybe not exactly what you're looking for, but David Foster Wallace (I
think) wrote an "Indexical" book review of a collection of prose poems that
was published in _Rain Taxi Review of Books_ (issue #21) within the last
year.

http://www.raintaxi.com/index.htm

As I recall, the form of the review was a deliberate comment on the content
of the review and the book being reviewed.

Aside from that if you're just looking for list poems, there's _The Vermont
Notebooks_  (I believe that's what they're called?) poems and drawings by
John Ashbery and Joe Brainard.  The poems are all (?(I haven't read it all
yet)) lists.  It was recently (?) republished by Granary Books.

Essay for Graduate Record Exams (GRE) from a dream:


On a Shelf, The Futility of Being

Here, on a shelf in my unaccustomed house, bottles and dishes are linked
together by association. Perhaps a plate is nestled upon another; perhaps
a bottle sits next to a bottle. All of these objects occupy my field of
view together, as if they are simultaneous, connected by other than their
random placement.

Ah, if they were only linked, the fate of one connected to the fate of
all! But such is not to be. Thus we divide the world into those objects
and associations deeply committed to one another, embedded within each
other, dependent upon one another - and those objects whose being in
relation to one another is nothing more than futile. Shamefully they
insist on connection that is not there; they exhaust themselves in the
effort, and to no avail.

Thursday, April 11, 8 pm

Diaspora Poetics
DISCO M FIGURE
TAN LIN
Screening/Reading
Music by dj somuchsoul (Wild Seed)

Langton kicks off its new literary series "Diaspora Poetics" with the West
Coast premiere of poet and critic Tan Lin=B9s poetry movie "Disco M Figure
(DMF)." "Diaspora Poetics" showcases innovative writers from varied
backgrounds whose work examines conditions of cultural dispersion across th=
e
boundaries of ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation.

With "Disco M Figure," Lin pulls contemporary poetry from its exile in the
realm of the
stiflingly academic, instead grounding it in an ambient pleasure world with
16.7 million shades of color backgrounds. Simultaneously visual and
narrative, "DMF" is a work of literature that isn=B9t read but gazed at; it=B9s
a poem and artwork that, as Lin so well puts it, "get the reader/viewer int=
o
a groove." Lin published "Lotion Bullwhip Giraffe" (Sun and Moon) in 1996,
and his poems have appeared in the "Boston Review," "Conjunctions," and "Ne=
w
American Writing," among others. He lives and works in New York.


Tuesday, April 16, 8 pm

Diaspora Poetics
SUMMI KAIPA  and  K. SILEM MOHAMMAD
Reading

"Diaspora Poetics" continues to explore diaspora in its aesthetic,
political, and personal dimensions with readings of new works by Summi Kaip=
a
and K. Silem Mohammad.

Kaipa reads from her work-in-progress "Was. Or. Am,"
and Mohammad reads recent work including selections from his new chapbook
"Ant." Kaipa=B9s work has appeared in "Tinfish," "Kenning," "Tool A Magazine,=
"
"Rain Taxi," and "Rhizome." She=B9s a member of San Francisco's Alliance for
Emerging Creative Artists (AECA) and the editor of "Interlope." Mohammad=B9s
poetry has appeared in "Combo," "Fourteen Hills," and "Kenning," among
others. His serial poem "hovercraft" was the Kenning summer chapbook for
2000. He teaches literature at UC Santa Cruz.

Tickets $6/$4 members, students, and seniors

great question, no answers from here, but would like to know.  index esp;
listing has probably been done a lot, as anaphora is a well-examined
rhetorical trope.  so please respond thru poetix!  thanks all!

warmth


Jennifer wonders about her new boy. Jennifer says, when we cuddle together
we are very very warm. Jennifer's boy wonders about this. Jennifer says,
look at it this way. We are warmer for two reasons. Where our bodies
touch, we are not cold and we pass warmth among us so that the warmth is
there and nice with us, and our bodies come together in warmth and
coolness and then warmness all over. And our skin which is not touching,
that skin is less than the separate skins of our separate selves. And so,
her boy says, if we adopt a third, there will be even less surface and
more inside and lovely warmth. yes yes says Jennifer, and we can add a
fourth and fifth, and her boy says as we add more and more, the surface is
smaller and smaller compared to all the lovely warmth inside. Oh yes says
her boy, if we had hundreds and hundreds, why then so many will be so
lovely warmth inside all over, and on the surface, even then only half
will be cold and the other half warmed by the great engine within. Yes,
says Jennifer, and we will be a part of that great engine and all warmed
with that lovely warmth and all toasty. We are warmed by our thinking says
Jennifer's boy. Yes yes yes says Jennifer, we are very warmed by our
hundreds of thinking thoughts and bodies surrounding us in such lovely
warmth.

Two instances that come to mind as notable (and pointedly idiosyncratic)
indexes are those to Pope's _Dunciad_ & Zukofsky's _"A"_.  (Warning: to my
recollection the compressed one-volume paperback Butts edition of Pope
deletes the index.) -- all best --N

How about Whitman's famous listing as an example of "index"? or Harryette
Mullen's new _Sleeping With the Dictionary_ which is arranged
alphabetically? (Less interestingly, the final piece in my first book _Re
dress_ has an "index." Lemme know if you'd like me to xerox a copy for you.)
Best,

PEER SEMINARS

Participation of conferees in peer seminars is one of the most significant =
features of the MSA conference. Seminars are small-group discussion sessi=
ons
(of no more than 15 people) for which participants write brief  position pa=
pers  that are read and circulated prior to the conference. Seminars gene=
rate
lively and valuable exchange during the conference and in some cases have c=
reated a network of scholars who have continued to work together. Further=
, the peer seminar model allows most conferees to seek financial support =
from their institutions as they educate themselves and their colleagues o=
n subjects of mutual interest.=20
Please visit our website at http://msa.press.jhu.edu/ for full descriptions=
 of these seminars.=20

Poet Gray Jacobik will appear at The Riverdale Society for Ethical
Culture, with the Exoterica Reading Series, on Saturday, April 6, at 8
pm.  The reading is accessible by taking the #1 subway line to the 242nd
St. terminal.
Gray Jacobik is a widely published poet whose work has appeared recently
in The Best American Poetry 1997 & 1999, Poetry, The Kenyon Review,
Ontario Review, Sycamore Review, Ploughshares, and the Alaska Quarterly
Review, among others. She is the recipient of a National Endowment for
the Arts Fellowship, fellowships from the Connecticut Commission on the
Arts, the 1997 winner of The Yeats Prize given by The Yeats Society of
New York, and The Emily Dickinson Prize sponsored by Universities West
Press. Her book, The Double Task, University of Massachusetts Press
(1998), received The Juniper Prize and was nominated for The James
Laughlin Award. The Surface of Last Scattering (Texas Review Press,
1999) was selected as the winner of the X. J. Kennedy Poetry Prize. Her
newest collection, Brave Disguises, winner of the AWP Poetry Series
Award, will be published in the fall of 2002 by the University of
Pittsburgh Press.

United States Poet Laureate Billy Collins has said, "Gray Jacobik's
poetry vibrates with an intensely female spirit, a voice that is eager
to declare her presence and flood the world with her worlds. Her
language is lush and smart, rich and crafted. And her cultural
scope-which includes Erik Satie and Pinocchio, Sappho and
Magritte-allows her, like the English metaphysicals, to use what she
knows to discover and express what she feels. Open this book, and it
will pull you in."

I seem to recall an index poem by Nicholson Baker in _The New Yorker_
sometime in the 1990's.

Uh, it must have been in a doctor's office waiting room or something!  Not
like I READ IT REGULARLY at the time or anything!

OK, fine!  They got me on the phone with one of those

Where is the index to "A" is it in the BNC at Texas? Or has it been found in
"A" by readers/researchers?  Obviously the listing technique is a good one:
a friend of mine (who took up poetry later than I even) Leicester Kyle had
as a poem a list of errata - which of course had been done in "Errata Suite"
by (sorry cant recall just now) I did a poem called "Chains" which used the
method of moving (from an initially randomly chosen word "Hastate" from my
Shorter Oxford) ... in a sense an old dictionary is a ready list, a ready
structure: I have (NFS I claim!) the First Edition of "in the Early Morning
Rain" by Ted Berrigan ..actually just noticed that his "Rusty Nails" is a
bit like my "Chains" in that the title and the "response" to the title are
deliberately not congruent (often a humorous or humoresque effect resultant:
or the congruence or relevance or connection or whatever is obscure eg as in
Stein's  "Tender Buttons" also he lists the "Ten Greatest Books of the Year,
1968".
  But is it Goldsmith (the US not the earlier British Goldsmith!) who has a
huge book which amasses thousands of words including ones scrabble fanatics
would only know about or where to obtain: so its kind of "self-indexing" ...
that would be interesting  to look at again.

  One is always skeptical: the form of the jar is their: the structure loos
above but aroud what is it structured and why? That's my "probem" , eg even
tho a lot pf people liked "Chains" I couldnt really explain why I'd written
it: it lacked an underpinning theme: I just wrote it (maybe that doesnt
matter) ... however indexing seems like a good starting point for eg
"writer's block"...
 Some thoughts. Richard.

As they say round here during baseball season, you could look it up.
The last 20 pages of any of the complete editions of "A" published
since whenever, the mid-1970s are an index of the poem created by
Zukofsky.

Marianne Moore's first book, "Observations" (1924), includes a wonderfully
fanciful index with lots of odd entries.  Unfortunately the book has not
been reprinted in its original form and is hard to find.  A good university
library should have it.

Ginsberg's "Collected Poems" has an index of proper names.

<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;great question, no answers from here, but would like to know.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;index esp;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;listing has probably been done a lot, as anaphora is a

I think the original question related to using index as a poetic device,
maybe ironically, and not to books of poems which contained indexes.

In the memorial reading of Gregory Corso's poetry at the Poetry Project, Gary
Sullivan read the titles of the poems in "The Happy Birthday of Death" which
appeared as a list, I think, at the end of the book. That was a striking use
of indexing. I think Gary has a extended interest in the poetic possibilities
of indexes.

Zachary Jack / A review of Chelsey Minnis's Zirconia

Zirconia: Poems by Chelsey Minnis
Fence Books, 2001

It is hard, at first, not to be disappointed with Chelsey Minnis's aptly
named first book, Zirconia, whose ellipses-studded interiors appear, on
first inspection, gimmicky and cut-rate-undercooked and oversold.
      However, Minnis, a graduate of the Iowa Writer's Workshop and a
keystone in Fence Book's young American poets line, makes a starry debut in
this slight but dazzling ravishment of phrase fragments and pearled
ellipses.
      Minnis' effort is, in a word, brilliant, as the titular wink
suggests. It is not, however, glaringly imitative, though the demonology it
conjures is not unlike Sexton and Plath's.
      The book opens with the whimsical "A Speech About the Moon," a wild
rumpus in couplets where the speaker importunes the moon and its
schizophrenic symbology: "silver hitching ball," "placid sea monster,"
"silver leg iron" (2). The elliptical moments, so much a fixture of what
follows, enter the volume organically here, arising in moments of
indecision, revision and ecstatic redirection. "A Speech's" unsettled and
unsettling rhetoric, its relentless interrogations, function as both
invocation and ars poetica: "I have to invent warm tawny roses that have
never been seen before.// Then I fix the sheets which are twisted around my
ankles and think, 'I have to be tormented.'" Overall, though, Minnis' dark
night of the soul is more slumber party, concluding with the
epistemologically aphoristic "thoughts are like terrible ballet teachers
with canes" ("A Speech" 3).
      In tone, Minnis is emphatically more Charlie's Angels than Belle of
Amherst, the poet-speaker wanting roughed-up by the stuff of life, to take
as much as to dish, a wish made explicit in the poem "Uh" which begins
"..uh..........I want to wear hot pants . . . . and rest my boot on the
back of a man's neck . . . and . . . . rise out of arctic waters with
curled icicles in my hair and a speargun" (13). In Minnis' blow-by-blow,
such powerlust rebounds as self-punishment: "I am too petulant . . . and .
. . I . . .want them to . . . centre death blows between . . . my shoulder
blades . . . and . . . then . . . gently lick electrodes . . . and stick
them to my temples" (15).
      There is something at once delightfully retro (read Nancy Sinatra)
and tragically hip about Zirconia-a vision and revision that takes in the
best of Anne Carsen, C.D. Wright, and Alice Notley-and makes it playful,
even campy. Zirconia's prose interludes ("Report on the Babies," "The Skull
Rings," "The Torturers," and "The Aquamarine") represent Minnis at her most
surreally deadpan, while giving the reader a badly-needed break from the
gazillions of dime-store ellipses. In poetic prose matching Ponge tone for
odd tone, Minnis rests the reader at "Report on the Babies," a close
encounters with infants who make babbling overture to a childless speaker
whose dark tone resembles Poe's, given feminine intuition, an hour of down
time, and a double espresso.
      Though, in poems hung on pop fashion fixtures-furs, gemstones,
dress-up Barbies-and righteous anger at a male establishment ("Uh's" "and
just want . . . to pluck the grey beards of old men . . . and . . . give
them . . . hairline fractures")-one detects a hint of the cliched post
feminist, Minnis knows how and when to pull her punches, making the blows
land as soft and satisfying as a good pillow fight. In "Big Doves" the
speaker arrives with "comfortable doves . . . to accomplish . . .my soft
ideas . . . and . . . . the doves are shy . . . . because they flap around
. . . in the areas . . . of the heart . . . that I want . . . to be . . .
flexed . . . thrashed . . . spiraled and . . . neurally lathed (6).
      Zirconia's glimmering phraseology, its "loose stone" parlance, must
be read to be fully appreciated, sprinkled, as it is, expertly across the
page. While other experiments with fragmentation, notably Alice Notley's
recent work, overwhelm both the eye and cortex, Minnis is a maestro when it
comes to word burnishing. The poems achieve their magnificence and
translucence as much by space as by space interrupt. The word amalgams,
both Latinate and vernacular, give the collection a characteristic alchemy
evident in the decadent "Sectional," whose speaker sinks "into a reverie in
leather . . . sectional couches . . . with caramel in my mouth" (23),
adding, "I am reliving . . . a moment and revolving . . . caramel as I am
surrounded on all sides by . . . soft panels of genuine . . . leather . . .
. launching my molars . . . into the cluster . . . in order to . . . locate
. . . the nucleus . . ."
What saves Minnis' Alberta prize-winning first collection from triviality
is both sense and sensibility, as it consistently transforms the
startlingly mundane into the phantasmagoric "Cherry's": "I see you are
kneeling. . . and raunchily . . . or ironically . . . scrubbing . . . the
floors with your . . . naughty manual labor . . . but . . . you want to
whisper your fears into the ear swirls of the wood . . ." (27). What Minnis
does better than any of her peers is not so much render moments as deepen
and elongate them, most emblematically in the poem "Flashbulb," where the
poet's sprawling syntax descends like photons, like stardust in a burst
aftermath. In "Flashbulb," "Uncut," and elsewhere, Minnis realizes the
language-sustain lesser writer's realize only as etude.
      Minnis' virtuosity and charm occasionally fail her in Zirconia, in
poems like "Supervermillion" and "Champagne," which come off sounding like
Dr. Demento novelty tracks or B-52's b-sides-but, overall, this is a
remarkably sure-footed and enthused whole.
      In the last third of the book, Minnis deftly weaves in what is,
presumably, autobiography, as in "Primrose," which relives the speaker's
mother's rape, recalling "blood in the courtyard . . . and blood on the
birdbath . . .and blood drizzled . . . on brown flagstones . . . as a red
fox bared its teeth . . . white harts . . . froze . . . and snow-hares fled
. . . and left . . . heartshaped footprints in the snow . . . that melted .
. . in the spring when I was born . . . and it is torture . . . for my
mother . . . that I am now luscious . . . and she is dead" (41-42).
      In the end, praise for Zirconia must end up in superlatives, though
not the "diamond-quality," knock-off variety the title ironically
anticipates. Minnis is careful not to undersell her gift in this first
collection, whose dazzling moments belong both to a wildchild improviser
and a sage conductor.


[Editor's Note: Since this book is typographically complex (and virtually
unquotable in its way), we are using three ellipses to stand in for
Minnis's long, elliptical strands; four ellipses are used when quoting
non-contiguous lines to indicate skipped or omitted material. Read the book
itself-obviously-for the full effect.]

[1] ONE: more index

Zukofsky's "Index of Names & Objects" is indeed idiosyncratic; and how like
him to acknowledge that the index as a form raises more questions than it
answers, being itself an irresistable alternate route through any book.
Beginning with a massive, though surely not an exhaustive citation of "a"
and subsequent entries for "A"-1 through -20 (though not sections 21-24, of
which the index is nevertheless paginally inclusive), Zuk's index careers
through such oddities as Agamemnon (listed separately for Roman and Italic
versions), allspice, an, anemone, arm, arms, aunt, be, "Bible, The" - and
so on. Das Kapital appears (where mentioned, not where quoted) between
dandelion and date palm, followed soon by the long entries at day, death,
delight, desire, dog, dream, ear, earth - and so on. Eye of course has its
expansive due, as does, minutely, finnimbrun. Having been much occupied
with Oppen lately, I am relieved to see there is but one entry for
Heidegger. Finally - well, not finally, but before moving on - let's not
forget Zuk's "preoccupation," horse.

Finnimbrun, by the way, is defined by the OED as "a trifle" or (equally
obscure imho) "a gimcrack"; it is a nonce term that entered the language
solely by way of its publication in Izaak Walton's Universal Angler (1676 -
it includes a revised version of the book you're thinking of): "He saw
Ribbins and Looking-glasses ... and Hobbyhorses ... and all the other
finnimbruns that make a compleat Country Fair." Perhaps we should alert the
nice folks at the Dictionary of the word's popular resurgence circa 1967:
"Like: Diogenes at / the fair's finnimbruns - / 'admiring in animals / what
we hate / in men?'"

Of the million other things to say regarding Zuk's index - and how could
there not be more than a million? - it may be worth noting that:

1. Several of the entries for "a" cite blocks of text (e.g., the first four
pages of "A"-22), perhaps indicating undiscovered mathematical constraints
comparable to those discussed by Ahearn, and by Zuk himself in his little
sourcebook to "A"-8.

2. Most of the entries for the various sections of "A" in fact refer not to
the pages on which those sections commence, but to the separate index for
"A"-24; the rest of the entries refer to various places in "A"-17 where
earlier sections are cited, and one citation in "A"-18.

3. Etcetera.

If we can say to a certainty that "Index of Names & Objects" is not a poem,
that can only be on the grounds that it is a piece of writing - they come
up periodically, delightfully - that makes the distinction itself small and
uncertain.


[2] TWO: less index

I have often thought the same with regard to Marianne Moore, who is too
often taken at her word and considered parsimonious in her insistent
citation of lines "in which the chief interest is borrowed." Those who
would hold this view should consider, first, the comic excess of "A Note on
the Notes" - the introductory paragraph that is in fact followed by a note
on the notes. Next one might look at her solicitous opening:

"A willingness to satisfy contrary objections to one's manner of writing
might turn one's work into the donkey that finally found itself being
carried by its masters..."

Having looked, then we might ask who is the real jackass in this picture?
but the reader who obtrudes with his suggestions. As not infrequently in
her work, here one finds Moore's language a lace barely concealing a tone
implying bad feeling. Most famous in this category is her "Pedantic
Literalist," but one also finds it in, e.g., "The Monkeys": reading the
1921 version, one finds it was, by title, "My Apish Cousins" - not
necessarily or even probably the zoo animals - that "winked too much and
were afraid of snakes." In any case, the complaintant reader of the notes
is summarily dismissed with a phrase whose slight but definite excess only
MM could discover:

"Perhaps those who are annoyed by provisos, detainments, and postscripts
could be persuaded to take probity on faith and disregard the notes."

On the other hand, it seems highly questionable that Moore's inclusion of
the notes has aught to do, as she claims, with honesty. Any careful reader
of the poems can attest that there are quotations that remain uncited, not
to mention a mixed use of quotation marks that appear and disappear in the
various editions that she edited, as well as regular self-as-source
quotations. Even in the notes, the distinction between quoted and
"original" material is uncommonly clouded. And this is not to mention, of
course, the relation of the content to tone, and tone to veritable feeling
- for she must be, as my friend Nick Lawrence once called her, "Ashbery's
grandmother." But all of this is far afield of the index, and another story
altogether.

The other Zukofsky index is, of course, the one that opens "Poem beginning
'The'" - his first published poem, wasn't it? So there's more symmetry
between the "A" and "The" than meets the eye.

Okay: I'll say no more but to recommend, for brief comment on the comic
uselessness of Zuk's earlier index, Ming-Qian Ma's article "A 'no man's
land!': Postmodern Citationality in Zukofsky's 'Poem beginning 'The''" (in
Mark Scroggins' collection Upper Limit Music).

Someone else may have already mentioned this, but Stephen Rodefer's _Four

I'm visiting New York briefly and will be reading at the Bowery Club on
Wednesday 17th April at 6.30 and at the Zinc Bar on Thursday 18th April at
6.30 for 7.

Please come along - if you don't know my work, this is a chance to hear it
but you can look up Jacket, How2, Cauldron & Net, Sugarmule, Perforations,
Samizdat (online) beforehand. There are a few magazines as well but I've
just been to the dentist and not up to remembering issues.

As you can see, I'm not good at pushing so I'll quote from the blurb of Duty
(published last year):

Hear ye! Hear ye! Geraldine McKenzie is entering the language hall of
mirrors. Listen for the inflections of the reflections. Duty calls. And then
some.

Orange County poetry, hosting the long-running Laguna Poets series from its
inception in the 1970s through its first 20 years.  John Thomas was one of
the original Venice Beats, who could claim friendship with both Ezra Pound

Nabakov's "Pale Fire" which is (based on or around) a poem in iambics and
rhyme rather like something by Pope or even Frost and is sometimes quite
beautiful: certainly I found it hauntingly strange. But it is then "Indexed"
or noted by the killer of the poet who then proceeds to spend a page or so
on a word or a line. Or less on other things: and these "notes" refer often
to further notes: and of course there arenotes on notes....and so on... But
there is apparently a very complex, a supercomplex intagio of meanings and
references that revolve around in something that is almost Borgesian.
  Pope indexed his Illliad I think and the Dunciad is a vast list: a
splenetic plenitude of vituperation and hate and of course its rather droll
and probably a great poem by that stunted torquatious and billious being.
  This is intersting on Zukofsky: like Marriane Moore he knew too much
...infuruiatingly erudite: impossibly and marvellously intelligent. Long
live lists and indices. For what an index is it is an indication: it all
spins, the signifiers dance, we are  lost for and in words: trapped inside
ideas: bubbled in the just not, the sly indexical, the fingered shapes, the
thing we can define but in defining it is dissolves and  is dissolved and is
or is or not or is... Richard.

Two more examples of creative indexes: Lisa Jarnot in Some Other Kind of
Mission has an index/collage in the back of it.  And Thalia Field, I believe,
also uses one in Point and Line.

Bernadette Mayer suggested playing around with the idea of an index in her
list of writing experiments.  http://poetryproject.com/mayer.html

My favorite in this vein is the one-page notebook of LZ's that Peter &
Meredith Quartermain blew up into a very large poster in 1979 entitled "An
Alphabet of Subjects (Contents this Notebook)" which outlines a portion of
Bottom: On Shakespeare. Even blown up to 8 or 10 times the normal size,
Zukofsky's handwriting only comes up to about a 12 point face. Nary a bit of
white space on the page whatsoever,

Where is the index to "A" is it in the BNC at Texas? Or has it been found in
"A" by readers/researchers?

As they say round here during baseball season, you could look it up.
The last 20 pages of any of the complete editions of "A" published
since whenever, the mid-1970s are an index of the poem created by

Dear All,

Here's my first and last statement on this matter to the Poetics list.
Included below are links to representatives and leaders you can contact to
voice your dissent.

For more information on the events, that you won't get from US media, you
can go to:  http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/0,2759,377264,00.html

Jonathan

    *

War, especially the killing of civilians (including women and children), is
not, has never been, and never will offer a viable solution to conflict.
WWII was not "won," but consummated in genocide and mass murder-- of Jewish
as well as of Japanese civilians; a consummation that failed in any way to
quench the "low intensity" conflict that has raged around the globe ever
since.

I am utterly ashamed of, and forswear any support for, my government's tacit
(and positive) encouragement of blatant military aggression against
civilians-- under the ideological blanket of a "war on terror"-- as well as
of what amount to war crimes (which include execution-style killings of
captured enemy) under the Geneva Convention.

I, and thousands of other Americans like me, urge those in power, on both
sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to immediately put an end to
hostilities.  Furthermore, Israel must withdraw from Palestinian
territories, and both Palestinian and Israeli leaders must come to the table
with good faith and unwavering determination to implement a lasting peace.
International observers presently on the ground in the Palestinian
territories should be authorized and deployed.

I also urge my own government to end the U.S. manufacture and exportation of
military hardware to unstable corners of the globe, as well as the biased
and disproportionate U.S. funding of Israeli militarism.  If any force must
be used, it should be to enforce a no-weapons embargo on areas like
Palestine and Israel.  Let the leaders of the free world lead by example,
not by the barrel of a gun!

By the same token, I also urge Palestinian leaders to cease and dismantle
the ideology of suicide martyrdom.

The Palestinian murder of Israeli civilians does nothing for the Palestinian
cause.  The brutal Israeli treatment of Palestinian peoples is likewise
impotent to prevent these atrocities, and does nothing for the Israeli
cause.  If murder and brutality must be commited, let such behavior stain
the enemy's hands and confuse the enemy's mind!

Nonviolent resistance is a far stronger force; if not the victor in the
short term it is the only one history will bear out, and the only force
capable of putting an end to the conflict.  By this token, military attacks
on peace activists in Ramallah and Bethlemen constitute the darkest possible
act.

Please, both sides (and those who implicitly support them), call off the
attacks NOW!

Sincerely,

urge a cessation of hostilities on both sides. Also encourage them to urge
the use of international observers, many of whom are currently in Ramallah

All of this should be filed under an index with the
heading of
Y-A-W-N.  Poor little academics...why don't you folks
get out into some sunshine and fresh air. It's
nonsense like this that proves why poetry doesn't
belong in the academies. Speaking of which, I had
planned to give my poetry collection to SUNY Buffalo,
but instead, I'll leave it to my kids so the words
live in their hearts and minds. I live for the day
when Postmodernism is seen for the empty-headed slop
that it is, and maybe you folks will start writing
POETRY like thinking humans instead of chit-chatting
about "poetics" like so many lillies of the field.

I'm glad Ken Rumbles mentioned ~The Vermont Notebook.~
 (It is, in some ways, Ashbery's most innovative book,
out of print since the mid-'70s, and not excerpted in
his ~Selected.~  I don't think the date passed yet,
but he's giving a reading from its re-printing--- this
month? at the St. Mark's Poetry Project.)


In 1999, I posted to the Buffalo Poetics List

Via Cambridge, Mass., New York, and San Francisco, Poets Theater arrives in
Detroit!


Performing Objects Stationed in the Sub World

by Carla Harryman

ZeitGeist Gallery and Performance Venue

2661 Michigan Avenue, Detroit

Friday, April 5, through Saturday, April 27, 2002


Continuing its commitment to art fostered in the city of Detroit, ZeitGeist
Detroit is pleased to present the premier production of Performing Objects
Stationed in the Sub World, a new play by Carla Harryman.

Performing Objects Stationed in the Sub World is a playful exploration of
memory and presence, of time as a function and a fluid that simultaneously
blurs and delineates our notions of past and present, city and suburb. The
language, actors, the objects that occupy the stage collaborate in the
creation of dialogue and song, scene and satire, emotion and color.
Child: This love life doesn't seem very gritty, does it? No feuds. No
macabre family members disrupting make-out sessions in the back seat of a
disabled vehicle. And only a hint of starvation, which is, in any case,
voluntary.
         And when you think of the children nearby rallying toward another
yard of perfect lawn line, where once there were mobs with fists raised
crashing in on the home of auto magnates, or so I wish, the dirt of desire
slips out of the grip of this account.
         And still this is it: vast, ferocious, surreptitious, unorthodox,
unsafe, slippery wet. I can hear my mother's voice in the distance.
Ms. Harryman was a co-founder of the San Francisco Poets Theater, and
currently lectures at Wayne State University. She has published over a
dozen works, most recently Gardener of Stars (Atelos Press, 2002), reviewed
at: http://metrotimes.com/editorial/review.asp?id=62217.

ZeitGeist's production features a phenomenal ensemble: Amy Arena (recently
of San Francisco), Phil Bolden (David's Red-Haired Death), Elana Elyce
(Second City), Maria Haag (Mary the Maid in The Bald Soprano), and Jen
House (Hal King in Abreact Theater's Lady Bright Review). John Jakary
(Waiting for Godot) directs.

Performance dates and times for Performing Objects Stationed in the Sub
World are:
Friday/Saturday, April 5/6, at 8:00 PM
Friday/Saturday, April 12/13, at 8:00 PM
Sunday, April 14, 4:00 PM
Friday/Saturday, April 19/20, at 8:00 PM
Sunday, April 21, 4:00 PM
Friday/Saturday, April 26/27, 8:00 PM
Admission for all performances is $15; $10 Student Admission (with student ID).

ZeitGeist Gallery and Performance Venue is located at 2661 Michigan Avenue
between 19th and 20th Streets, Detroit, less than a mile west of old Tiger
Stadium. For additional information and reservations, call 313-965-9192.
ZeitGeist is also located on the web at:

I know!  The lilies in the field outside _my_ window, for instance, don't
give me a moment's rest: it's always "lower limit" this, and "aleatory"
that, and blah blah blah "neofuturist adventurism," and yak yak yak "chaste
diction."

Seriously, did you once have a really bad experience with an index or
something?

It troubles me deeply to think that someone is living for the day when
Postmodernism is seen for empty-headed slop -- Myself, I've found much more
to live for, including lillies of the field.  I do regret mightily that we
will not be able to consult the collections of Mr. Clinefelter in years to
come, something else I might live for.

Truthfully, the only person I ever knew of who got anywhere with Lillies of
the Field was Sidney Poitier, who won an Oscar for it;  Most of us thought
he should have gotten it for Raisin in the Sun.  But there's nothing like a
group of nuns singing "Amen" (the Impressions' version) to give you
something to live for ---

I could live for the day I'd hear Curtis Mayfiled singing "Amen" again -- I
could live for the day that Ron Silliman, Erica Hunt, Jeffery Allen and
Juliana Spahr make return visits to my town.  I live for the day I get home
to my wife.  I'll happily live for the day I read an exciting new poet --
Living for the day postmodernism is seen as empty-headed slop is rather
like living for empty-headed slop -- I'll take full-headed slop any day ---

These answers have been bothering me. Did I get the original query
wrong? I didnt think it was about works with indices appended, but
rather the index AS the work.

To Jim Clinefelter:

"Index" poetry isn't really postmodern, is it?  What about the great
catalogs in the Old Testament?  Ecclesiastes, Job, etc? What about the
Beatitudes?  Lists, catalogs, indexes, whatever you might call them, are
present throughout literature.  Your view seems terribly myopic.

Maybe you just posted this to get a little attention, though.

Let me add that I think the opposition of erudition or scholarliness as
being "chit-chatting" or tea-party irrelevance is a cheap, cheap thing.
There must be room to explore all the edges and corners, and I've observed
that those Jeremiahs who would call us back to the "center" are often people
who haven't made much hay of their own. In other words, sour grapes. I'm not
saying there's no such thing as trivia, I'm just saying that short, caustic
warnings against it are inconsiderate and usually cheap. That said, "index
poetry", catalogs, or lists, are in no wise peripheral!  If there *is* a
center in Western literature, that might well be it!  Look at the *%+*# ten
commandments!!!!

Sorry to erupt. And to imply a Christian canon. I'm probably playing into a
prankster's hand.

the Field index is not an index to the work; she wrote the faux apparatus

mIEKAL,

travis ortiz here. i saw your note on the poetics list about cross platform
font issues... this can be a big problem, but if you both start out with the
same font that is already cross-platform that might help save you an
enormous headache. when we (atelos) were publishing jalal toufic's
_forthcoming_ (transliterated arabic), i had trouble because the diacritical
marks did not map over correctly to my version of the font that allowed me
to use the same diacritical marks. however, the company, linguistic software
(www.linguisticsoftware.com) has both mac and pc fonts that *should* (in
theory map correctly on both systems. my suggestion would be to get one of
the cyrillic font families that does cross-over nicely and have Maria
Zavialova install the version on her machine too. she can then carefully
check to see if everything from her original font to the new one transferred
well. it might be easier to have her do that checking. most times when you
get junk characters instead of the replacement character, you can do a
global search and replace. that's what i ended up doing in the end. anyway,
i hope that helps. the linguistic software people were immensely courteous
and helpful to me.

good luck.

ciao,
trravis

GERALDINE MONK was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, in 1952, and is
celebrated as a reader and performer of "genuine word magic ... a wonderful
poet: revelatory, intense, ever surprising." She regularly works with
improvised musicians; her collaboration with Martin Archer, Angel High
Wires, was issued on CD by Voiceprint in 2001. Her recent books include
Noctivagations (West House), Interregnum, a sequence of poems on the Pendle
Witches (Creation Books), and The Sway of Precious Demons: Selected Poems
(North and South).

ALAN HALSEY, born in London in 1949, is a poet, book dealer, publisher, and
graphic artist, whose remarkable works ("fierce and quiet ... determined,
and without illusion, the kind of poetry we need") include A Robin Hood
Book (West House), The Text of Shelley's Death (Five Seasons), and
Wittgenstein's Devil: Selected Writing 1978-1998 (Stride). He ran the
Poetry Bookshop in Hay-on-Wye from 1981-96, and lives with Geraldine Monk
in Sheffield.

Halsey's and Monk's works have appeared in many anthologies, including
Conductors of Chaos (Picador 1996), Other: British and Irish Poetry since
1970 (Wesleyan UP 1999) and Anthology of Twentieth-Century British & Irish
Poetry (Oxford UP 2001).

pete et al.:

at least two cases in the work of bruce andrews. "index" is a
quotation-collage essay from the mid-seventies, reprinted in _paradise
and method_. also the table of contents for the 100 poems in _i don't
have any paper so shut up, or, social romaticism_ have been printed and
read on their own as a separate piece.

ange mlinko has a poem called "index excerpt (book)" at

What about a false index to a book as an art form?  When I worked as an
indexer I often had an impulse (good thing my impulse control was operating
at the time) to provide a 'poetic' index rather than a 'factual' index to a
book.  i would bet others have had the same impulse and followed through?

Jennifer's essay of pride and cowardice


god did not intend for humans to populate the earth. by virtue and example
of the first death, there's death for everyone. by virtue of the first
murder, there's everyone's murder, our true disappearance. we're all
chosen people; our time has come, we'll bring ourselves down. because of
abraham, moses, jesus and mohammed, prophets of one and scapegoats of the
other, we're the seeds of world destruction. by virtue of einstein, cosmos
and energy-mass. by virtue of bin-laden and bush, unleashing of fermi and
binding of newton, by virtue of marx and stalin, lincoln and lenin, the
harnessing of humanism in the enlightenment of the slave. god did intend
us to perish, i'm sure. i'm the prophet of perishing. i'm the prophet of
preparation.  listen and believe, believe and listen. i'm the prophet of
mass-destruction, of energy-mass destruction. truly everyone's afraid, and
most of all, of me. of me, me, me. of me.

I havent read - can any one "read" L Z's "A" right through?  I'm about to
embark - I hope it doesnt take me ten years (not of continuous reading you
must understand!) as did reading Ulyssees: and Finnegans... lies somewhere
unread.  But I must have a good dig into Zukovsky...so he kind of
recapitulates the book at the end: the "text" self -commenting?  From Mark
Scroggins's book and Ahearn's and somewhat Michelles Leggott's
interpretation of 80 Flowers.
  The "Poem Beginnning The" is certainly a marvellous poem: but its
fascinating to see -or I could imagine it would - the manuscript (which is
one reason collectors pay such big sums eg Kerouac's "drum" manuscript or
his "scroll" went for about US$2.4 million: but the thing as I saw it when I
saw and exhibition at Auck Uni (1990 I think) of the various drafts of a
poem by Alan Curnow was not the completed  - static - "finished" or
"perfect" poem at the end: what fascinated me was the whole process of the
thing: in this sense I dispute the concept of things having a completed
round: the process fascinates me...but many modernist and earlier poets
struggled for the "perfect" poem (which if found would obviate further
writing!) .. but as to the blow up of the Zukofsky - lets not belatedly
sanctify him like  Charles Ives was (according to (musician-composer)
Berbstein hhe has been): but ceratinly he is pivotal as they say as is Stein
and Marrianne Moore even maybe Bishop etal ...you all know the names: and
the indexing or pointing is sly (Auden: points a sly index finger at the
sky) as we know there is never a conclusion: how can we reach conclusion in
this rent tent: this BigVerse? Why want to? Bottom apparently has much that
is in "A" and we know that the "depth" of the etymylogical references can
only reach so far: and people can come along and extend into the beginnings
of the making without irony or direspect: the language belongs to...who?
  It would be a fool who underestinmated - not the power of terrorists or
military power anywhere (West East North South) but  the word: the music
created by the word: the power of language to terrify and excite, baffle and
enlight: the delight of lists and the attempt to order: the chargers in the
lists: the charge:chaos versus dionysius and so on and on ... the
ludicrously ludic: the near but never there upper limit of the music of the
dance: the intellection, the vision, the connection, the disconnection, the
leap, the fall, the horse: the horsing horse...in the lists..indicate in:
get in: a a a aa aa aa aaa aaaa aaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaaa
aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaa  aaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
bbbbbbbbbbbb  and so on. Richard.

Aaron. But people are communicating: ideas will come. The List has got some
talk going: erudition: ok we are all more or less ... those who are erudite
might be said to have worked hard to gain that knowledge: and are rightly
proud of their knowledge: especially if others can pick up some ideas. Great
things come form stones and dust.... and so on... Who cares if its been done
before: let's see what we can all do with a list poem and so on. Everyone
loves attention sometimes: why not?  I know I do "Who hasn't wanted to burn
down a public building, I know I have" (Monty Python skit)."That's probably
one reason we write poems - good or bad. To show off. I'm a show off: but
you wont get me to shove off...Everything is present throughout literature:
its a new "take" we might be seeking: its a kind of brainstornming ... as in
Chess when one considers the most unlikely moves (and the most likely) often
those are the one's that win the game...or Mohammed Ali leans on the
ropes....Get with it Aaron...dont become a fussy old (but very interesting)
Mr Sammmler (!)...and so on... Richard

   [One might like to discuss the media coverage of the Israeli actions
in the
   West Bank. The trouble is the IDF has done an excellent job of keeping

   reporters out of the area under siege. Often, the Israeli media is the
best
   source for realities on the ground, and Palestinian sources also
provide
   important coverage that the American "free press" does not give us.
Reports
   now, from most sources, are vague at best and often come from official

   Israeli sources. International peace workers who have been able to
stay in
   the West Bank have been able to get some word out about the actual
events on
   the ground, and the picture they present is horrifying. The report
below is
   a first-person account, and can't be verified. Yet it is remarkably
   consistent with reporting that has emerged on some sources, in dribs
and
   drabs, such as Pacifica radio and other e-mail transmissions. While
most
   news sources are reporting only on Israeli troop movements and various

   firings of guns and tank she
   lls, without much mention of the actual scope of
   damage in lives and injuries on Palestinians, the reports that have
emerged
   through e-mail and the occasional cell phone call or other
transmission
   paint a frightening picture of many people being killed, often in cold

   blood, and massive devastation in the city of Ramallah. Ambulances are

   prevented from reaching the wounded, and hospitals have also been all
but
   shut down in some cases. Even journalists and internationals are not
free
   from Israeli fire, a marked change in Israeli tactics from the past.
There
   is a great likelihood that when the truth comes out fully about the
events
   currently transpiring in Ramallah, it will be much worse than most
people
   are being led to believe. - MP]

   Urgent: Eyewitness report from Ramallah
   Posted by The Editor

   Ramallah,
   Occupied Palestine -- My name is Tzaporah Ryter. I am an American
   student from the University of Minnesota. I currently am in Ramallah.
We are
   under a terrible siege and people are being massacred by both the
Israeli
   army and armed militia groups of Israeli settlers. They are shooting
outside
   at anything that moves.

   I am urgently pleading for as much outside help as possible to help
save
   lives here.

   I arrived in Ramallah last Thursday. I had come back for a visit to
the
   Palestinian city where I had been previously living and studying. On
   Thursday afternoon, the Israeli army began sealing off each entrance
to
   Ramallah and there were rumors that they planned to invade.

   People were rushing back home from across checkpoints and also people
were
   trying to flee. People were not allowed to go out and many working
people --
   with homes and children to return to -- were not allowed in, everyone
was
   trying to take cover. Those traveling in began desperately searching
for
   alternative
   ways and traveling in groups, but the Israelis were firing upon
   them and everyone was running and screaming.

   Women carrying their children were trying desperately to flee from
Ramallah,
   carrying infants and toddlers, and their young children were running
along
   in the rain through the fields, slipping and falling on the rocks,
trying to
   reach safety. Israeli jeeps were speeding across the terrain pulling
up from
   every direction and shooting at the women and children, and also at
me, as

   we ran in opposite directions. They were chasing down people, hunting
them
   like that in the fields.

   When I reached Ramallah, people were panicking and trying to buy
bread, rice
   and milk from corner stores, but most supplies were already gone. We
bought
   what we could and went inside to wait for what was coming.

   When night fell, Israeli tanks began to invade and also we saw Israeli

   troops coming on foot from the valley, and surrounding our house. I
could
   hear them calling to each other in Hebre
   w. They were against our door and
   all around. They were firing everywhere a barrage of bullets and there
was
   tank fire. We had to lay on the floor and keep silent. We stayed
there, on
   the floor, for nearly four days in the darkness.

   We knew that our circumstances were better than others because old
people or
   infants or people with medical emergency needs had no help. It was
very
   cold, with most families packed all in one room. Some people are
without
   life sustaining medicines like insulin, and they are altering their
doses
   dangerously if they have any medicine left to take. People are
becoming
   dangerously sick from lack of food and water and heat. The fear and
terror
   only makes things worse, but it cannot be avoided.

   In the daytime, we heard them shooting people in the streets, and
could hear
   them screaming and screaming. No ambulance was allowed through. Then
their
   screams stopped and there was just silence.

   We had a telephone and would receive calls from all over telling
    us what was
   happening. Everyone is in grave danger and Israeli soldiers were
killing
   people everywhere. They are arresting medics and ambulance drivers,
   including foreign volunteer medical workers.

   They keep taking doctors and medics, just now another call. Again,
this time
   the wife of a doctor telling us her husband has been taken from the
   ambulance.

   Large groups of people have been found in rooms, shot dead, there are
blood
   marks where they have lined people up on their knees and shot them,
with
   their ID cards laying on top of them. They are taking people from
their
   homes, blindfolding them, removing their clothes, taking them away or
lining
   them up and shooting them against the wall.

   People are making phone calls and saying that these soldiers and
militia
   have come in and are shooting people and then the line cuts off.

   The numbers of these killings I fear are much greater than the numbers

   confirmed in the press, because the human rights offices and the media

   centers h
   ave been stormed, and everything is shut down. No one can move
   without almost certain chance of being shot by the Isreali snipers,
who are
   everywhere.

   The Israelis are demanding that all journalists leave Ramallah and
today
   another foreign journalist was shot. They do not want any more
   internationals here and are deporting people. It seems quite clear
that they
   do not want eyewitnesses which is only heightening my own fears.

   The hospitals have also been surrounded and invaded and Israeli troops
are
   taking the injured people and interrogating them. Today a woman, a
patient,
   tried to walk out from hospital. The Israelis shot her in the neck and

   killed her.

   The Palestinian Ministry of Health is saying that they fear the spread
of
   diseases because of the number of unburied corpses.

   The numbers are only growing in reports of the mass killings here and
   Israeli troops continue to round up people. People are calling
frantically,
   missing a relative and we do not know where they ha
   ve been taken, including
   children.

   The numbers we have now exceed 600, and we are estimating between 700
and
   800. All human rights groups and legal advocates are being denied any
   information of where the detained are being held. From what we know
   confirmed is that 10% of those taken so far have been children under
age 18.

   On the fourth day I decided to try to move. People were running out of

   supplies and I also was so worried about people, and had to check to
see if
   they were okay. If I didn't, I feared panic would overtake me so badly
that
   I really had no other choice but to try and go.

   It was not safe where I was in any case and at least if I left I would
still

   have my sanity. It was really terrifying as there are some
internationals
   here, usually traveling in groups, and the Israelis are saying on the
radio
   that they will arrest or shoot the internationals. They did shoot some

   yesterday and regardless, it's not as if snipers differentiate and
they are
   everywhere.

   My fr
   iends told me not to go, and were really scared for me, but I had to
   go. When I went outside, there were cars all shot up and hit by
multiple
   bullets and shells in the middle of the road, unparked. There must
have been
   people in them but I don't know where their bodies are. There are no
reports
   of them, but they must exist.

   I got to the corner trying to go to the bakery for bread and food for
   people. Some people were calling and calling with only one cup of rice
left.
   I made it to the corner but they opened fire on my first try, and shot
at
   me, so I had to turn back.

   After that I tried again and it took me one day to make it a block
because I
   had to start over again and again. I had to climb through the valley,
and as
   I passed house by house, people were warning me and pointing out what
path
   seemed safest for these two minutes. In the next two minutes, it would
be
   something different. They really helped to keep my path safe.

   Today is Day Five and they are still rounding up
    people like this and we
   hear them shooting all day long.

   This afternoon the Israelis suddenly lifted the curfew, suddenly
announcing
   that everyone had two hours to go out to get food. However, the
Israeli
   soldiers also took food from many of the stores, looted, and there is
no
   bread or things. People went to get whatever they could.

   Even though the Israeli army said it had lifted the closure for two
hours --
   in which we still were not able to transfer medical supplies and still
was
   not long enough to everything that was badly needed -- the Israelis
   continued shooting people in the streets indiscriminately on their
way, so
   people were running around trying to make it to the store or find a
safe
   route only to have to run back home again. It was an added cruelty and

   terror tactic in this macabre situation, a sick joke: starve people
and then
   shoot them when they try to find food with your permission.

   In an apartment building in Beitunia neighborhood where I used to
live, the
   y
   took 60 people who were my neighbors, including several familes, and
pushed
   them into one room since last night. The Israelis told them that they
are to
   be used as "human shields", as the apartment building is across from a

   building that they were invading.

   One child needs to go to the hospital since last night and, initially,
the
   families were able to call outside. Now, the Israelis have taken their

   phones.

   There are reports that they are rounding up men between the ages of 14
and
   45 in that neighborhood, and these civilians, from these same
Palestinian
   families trapped in that building, were just used to walk in front of
an
   Israeli tank as it invaded the Preventative Security Compound.

   Reports also have alleged that the Israelis were saying that some
could
   leave but shot them when they attempted to leave. The buildings there
are
   burning, and people are trapped inside.

   We keep calling to try to find people but there has been no
electricity and
   most people's phones are
   dead now. I do not know what is happening to many
   people. The only solution to this is to try to brave the deadly
streets in
   order to check, but its almost impossible and terrifying to leave the
house
   at all.

   Each place I come to, I am afraid to leave not only for myself but for

   everyone else in this horrifying position. Israeli death squads have
been
   yanking people into the street. I also hear only shooting and
shooting, with
   no return fire. This suggest that unarmed civilians are being gunned
down
   mercilessly everywhere and I am so scared for everyone. I feel like
maybe if
   I leave one place, one area or neighborhood I will never see the
people
   again alive.

   There are more explosions outside now and more shooting. Another
explosion.
   More firing, it just doesn't stop.

   This is a massacre. The foreign delegations tried to get in but were
turned

   back, the International Committee of the Red Cross is trying to help
but
   they are being ignored. Please help.

   I am not only scared f
   or myself and for people here, but if this cannot be
   stopped, I am truly scared for all of humanity, for a world in which
we send
   men to the moon but cannot stop ethnic cleansing.

   On the news in America, we see hardly anything of demonstrations. What
are
   you doing over there?

   There do not seem to be any reports of what is happening. In truth,
its got
   to stop. Please go out to the streets, please demand a response from
your
   representatives. Be loud, march up to the capitals, refuse to leave
until
   the Israelis withdraw. Act now! Tell them the Israelis are murdering
   innocent people whose only crime is being born in their own homeland,
a
   Palestinian under a military occupation.

   Demand international protection for the Palestinian people, scream
that this
   is an affront to humanity and that it is time that the US not only
stop
   supporting Israel, but that the US stop its abuse of human rights
within its
   own borders. This is about all of our struggles. For the love of God,
please
   s
   top this slaughter. Please help.

I think you're remembering a Chinese encyclopedia (no doubt fictional) that
Borges describes in an essay, "The Analytical Language of John Wilkins" ("El
idioma analitico de John Wilkins") from *Otras inquisiciones.*  I'm too lazy
to find the translation that doubtless exists, so here's mine:

" . . . a certain Chinese encyclopedia entitled *Celestial Emporium of
Benevolent Knowledge.*  In its distant pages it is written that animals are
divided into these categories: (a) belonging to the Emperor, (b) mummified,
(c) tame, (d) suckling pigs, (e) mermaids, (f) fantastic, (g) loose dogs,
(h) included in this classification, (i) running around as if crazed, (j)
uncountable, (k) drawn with a very fine camel's hair brush, (l) etcetera,
(m) that have just broken a vase, (n) that from a distance look like flies.
. . ."

I've always thought this list was a hoot, and I also suspect that there are
some in-jokes (philosophical and otherwise) included in it that I don't get.
  Thanks for reminding me of it.  I can give more clues to finding the
original if anyone's interested.

Borges is a prose writer, but he played a lot of formal games of the kind
you're more likely to find in poetry, such as disguising a short story as a
scholarly bibliography or a book review.

I'm not sure if Derek or Craig or anyone else has already mentioned or
reposted this in response to the index-poem query, but the advertisement
I've pasted below showed up on this list just a few weeks ago.  I haven't
seen the book yet, but it sounds fascinating.

-------------------------------------

housepress is pleased to announce the release of :

INDEX
by Craig Dworkin.

ABOUT INDEX:
"I really do not know that anything has ever been more interesting than
diagramming sentences," wrote Gertrude Stein, and when I came across the
late 19th Century grammar book "How to Parse"--the very book that Stein
might well have used in school--I of course began to parse it into its own
system.  The title, for instance, translates as "Adverb preposition of the
infinitive Transitive Active Voice Infinitive Mood Present Tense Verb."

The first part of this project, then, will present that translated text, and
the second part of the project will be to take that parsed text as a
template from which to write a new work that will be thematically quite
different than the original grammar book (perhaps a novel?  a love story? a
manifesto?), but will have the identical grammatical structure as the
original textbook.

"My book might be called Philosophical Grammar.  This title would no doubt
have the smell of a textbook title, but that doesn't matter, for behind it
there is the book" (Ludwig Wittgenstein).  Or as Judith Butler puts it: "The
anticipations of grammar are always and only retroactively installed."  Or,
again, as Nietzsche wrote: "God is dead, but we still have grammar."

ABOUT CRAIG DWORKIN:
Craig Dworkin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of English at
Princeton University.  Recent essays have appeared in October, Sagetrieb,
and the St. Mark's Poetry Project Newsletter, and his critical study of the
politics of appropriation, "Reading the Illegible," is forthcoming this
spring from Northwestern University Press.  A book of poetry is forthcoming
from Atelos.

published in a limited edition of 60 handbound and numbered copies.

$6.00 each

I haven't read the whole thread, so I hope I'm not being repetitive, but has
anybody mentioned Paul Violi's index poem or Peter Gizzi's cento, Ode:

Dear List,

I usually lurk, but during a time like this perhaps poets should be paying
a little attention to the corruption of political discourse.

Just some meditations in a time of lies and delusions:

In colonial wars, the resistance of the natives is often savage, illicit,
beyond the bounds of "civilization," while the violence of the colonizers
is ordered, ruled, legal, and, above all, "civilized."  Native Americans
commit massacres, Mau Maus target white settlers, Vietnamese ambush
American soldiers, and Palestinians blow themselves up.  The violence of
the natives is, indeed, ugly and, often, indiscriminate.  I don't think
suicide bombings within the 1948 borders are tactically useful -- and I
find them abhorrent -- but I doubt if attacks were limited to the West Bank
and Gaza or to military targets whether the Israeli and US governments
would stop calling them terrorism (just as the South African government,
despite the ANC's restraint, kept calling the ANC terrorists).  Sharon,
meanwhile, says that his violence is really Arafat's fault, that the
Palestinians are forcing him to be violent against his own will. Sharon had
a close call with the Saudi peace plan, as vague as the plan may have been.
Israel in 1967 said it had no territorial ambitions in the West Bank and
Gaza and only wanted peace and recognition. Now that recognition is
offered, Sharon had to wiggle away. No, Sharon and the Zionist leadership
want to seize all of Palestine and, most importantly, destroy the
Palestinian people -- or at least their national aspirations -- and Arafat
made him do it. From the colonizer's point of view, Sharon understands that
if he makes a REAL concession, he would not only be stopping colonial
expansion and pulling back from settlements, but he would also be calling
into question the entire Zionist, colonial project (and even if the
refugees do not return, the fear of a "ghost dance" makes him
tremble).  So, he continues, slithering out of any negotiation or peace
plan, and we have to understand that his real goal, his "civilized" use of
violence, is to destroy the Palestinian people as a people, preferably
through "transfer," also known as ethnic cleansing, a one-way ticket not
just for Arafat but for everyone.  If he can do this without murdering ALL
the people, all the better, but if he has to kill off great numbers, do not
underestimate his ability to do just that.  But, given how suicide bombing
has become a mass movement (a horrible thought in itself), Sharon's logic
of "uprooting" terror will lead to killing the suicide bombers before they
kill themselves ("Kill Suicide") -- and killing their "infrastructure,"
which means genocidal violence to the entire Palestinian people.  Given the
use of suicide in the Israeli national myth -- the graduation ceremonies of
IDF soldiers at the ruins of Massada, for example, exhorting soldiers to
suicide instead of defeat -- it's sadly ironic that Israelis can't seem to
understand why and how Palestinians could do suicide bombings.  Given the
horrors of Jewish history, it's bitterly ironic that Israelis can't
recognize the fighters of the Warsaw Ghetto in the eyes of the
Palestinians.  But, of course, the Israeli settlers are "civilized," and
the Palestinian "natives" are simply cruel, savage, and value life
less.  And the US, cruelest of all, will continue to defend "civilization"
in the form of Sharon because, as Sharon said, Arafat forced the Israelis
to become murderers and he can only do what Arafat has forced him to
do.  Got that?

Subject:      University of Iasi, Romania needs books
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I received this from another list and thought this would be a good place

to relay the message:

Hello!

I am a lecturer at the English Department of the "Alexandru Ioan Cuza"
University of Iasi, Romania.

My English Department is planing to introduce a course about The Ethnic
Literature of the United States (mostly about the Afro-American, Native
American, Chinese American novel).

Unfortunately for us, we do not have funds to purchase books for this
project. The average salary of a Romanian academic (university
professor) is approx. $ 200 a month, and there are no institutional
funds for our project. So, this American Studies
project is at a dead end.

But perhaps it is not so!

I was studying John Winthrop's "A Model of Christian Charity", and his
inspiring words have given me an idea:

"We must be willing to abridge ourselves of our superfluities for the
supply of others' necessities", says John Winthrop.

This has given me an idea. Perhaps if I write (by E-mail) to American
colleagues, to professors of American Literature (and American Studies)
and ask them to send us some USED books that they could dispense of,
this could help us out of our
quandary.

(We have only ONE COPY of "The Color Purple", by Alice Walker. The group

of students signing up for this course will contain 24 people. We have
no copy of "Black Boy" or "Native Son" by Richard Wright, or books by
Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, Gloria Naylor, Jean Toomer, Chinese
Americans, Leslie Marmon Silko etc.)


Used books that you could dispense of - classics of American Literature,

not soap... We have no use for soap.

I have heard that if a book package is under 4#, it can go Common (?)
letter rate, and the cost is only about $ 13 to send the books by ship.
Or, still better, if you send books via M-Bag, the expedition costs 1
dollar per pound. The books reach us in 3
months. Quite late, but we'll still be here after three months, the
English Department is not leaving anywhere.

If you or any colleagues of yours could help our English Department with

used books, send books to the address below.

Specify as an individual addressee the professor in charge of the
project (Lecturer Irina Chirica), otherwise the books may disappear -
otherwise there will be many clerks handling them at our university, and

they may disappear because there will be
many links until the books reach the professor in charge of the project.

Thank you for your time. If you have no time for this, forget it and
please forgive us for daring to suggest something like this.

Sincerely yours,

Irina Chirica, American Studies Lecturer at the University of Iasi,

This looks like a great idea Bob but be warned that mail is extremely slow
to Romania...  I had a global express package to Bucuresti take a month, I
hate to think how long surface mail would take...      mIEKAL

To be a bit "erudite" as Aaron Belz accusez-nous (actually I dont know any
French: I invent my own translations: what does accusez-nous mean if
anything?)...to get clever: I; say that Borges was here influenced by Swift
with a dash of Rabellais .... the animals being metaphoric of certain human
types: I dont know what the in jokes would be: I think that a lot of Borges
stuff is just as you see it eg his gangster stories -  but then I suppose
its just that the acco-type boffins havent dissected him ad infinitum like
they have old Joyce baby. Cheers, Richard.

the zone


this is the zone, dave said, you go to the zone. that's how we survive
here. in the zone we're open to the world. it's not something i can
describe. it's outside of language. it's a sensitivity to the timing and
passing of familiar things. it's a withdrawal of the human from imminence,
it's keenness and meditation, it's the ululations changing pitch around
the pond at two in the morning, and the sound of wood stork wings at the
breeding ground at five in the afternoon. the ululations changed pitch,
holding the onset and rhythm through everything. at one end of the pond,
other animals were signaling; everything was loud, energetic, and out of
site at two in the morning. we crawled back through the thicket,
photographing inside animal holes and those cavernous spaces beneath the
root structures of overturned trees. there were several closeup images of
cormorants, showing the structure of the back feathers. there were large
egrets and a white morph of the great blue as well as several green herons
feeding. cormorant young were everywhere. at shark valley, the anhinga
chicks were just about ready to fly away. we stopped tourists from
throwing sticks at an alligator, which was furious and moving at lightning
speed. i yelled at twenty of them. i was a madman in the zone. you go to
the zone, dave said, that's how you survive here. we can enter the zone
any time. it's emptied of people. other things are speaking or quiet;
other things approach like the peculiar anole that sat for :we were back
out on the southern road to flamingo; the small unmarked boardwalk was
dry, the periphyton turned to mud. this time we went out to the end at
christian point; there were small crabs of two types, and horseshoe crabs
washed up and dead on the shore. the cacti thickened nearer the coast, and
the tri-lobed form gave way to six-lobed and then almost columnar links at
the tip. the periphyton was dried, desert-dried, and there were black and
light-grey lichen across the mud-flats. the first time we took the trail,
there were magnificent osprey; this time, nothing. but at the farthest
pond there were two roseate spoonbills. i looked for swallow-tailed kites
or snail-kites at the stop-off points, but none were to be seen. a lot of
blue tilapia on the anhinga trail. no more deer, just dried and desiccated
landscape, various small flowers. all of the mangrove were doing well,
both red and black in the desert meadow of christian point. and somewhere
we heard parrots.:today we rescued one of the larger slugs; for the first
time i was ensured it wasn't a flatworm - its head appeared at the upper
end. the spider, about three centimeters across, managed to rebuild its
web. the synchronous ululations of the frogs stopped; they were apparently
signaled by yesterday's rain. in the thicket,, the medallion or blood-
sucking conenoses were out again; this identification is hazy, incorrect,
confusing. there were two albino ones, all pink and red and yellow, about
an inch and a half in length and an inch in width. they had moved to
different branches on another tree. we found our first slime mold, yellow
and bulbous, in the thicket as well. and some strange small reddish birds;
i'll get the identification later.::i'll get them all, these repeated
images, five-hundred nine so far,

repeated images, hardly moving at all. our favorite anole, beautiful and
courageous and in love with innovati0n.X Folder: INBOX M My repeated
images, hardly moving at all. our favorite anole, beautiful and coura
geous and in love with innovation.

Ken. Thou liest. Some things happen in Panmure, Auckland. We can even boast
a massacre: but the poetry isnt so frequent as NY where, when I visited you
could get a Poetry Calendar and I get pissed every night and go to evrything
and read "incognito" and actually  a few people called me "The Kiwi" but I
didnt quite take NY by storm: although my poem "The Fuck" caused some double
takes:I must agree with you: In those days (1993) I was fascinated by NY:
the city of art and gangsters and where endless movies are based and so many
crazy people and it never sleeps and it roars at you and and Ted Berrigan
and Frank O'Hara were there and Dylan Thomas once and Zulofsky and many
famous pop stars and so on and "Mr Sammler's Planet" is based there and many
movies set there and its evil with Batman and the Joker and Andy Warhol and
funny and scewy with danny deVito of the "Taxi" series and every thing
happens there and everyone is dashing about like madmen or there's a guy
with a big cowboy hat and  a revolver outside a big hotel and you've got
subways and the Brooklyn Bridge there (Hart Crane's Bridge) and I saw a
squirrel for the first tiome in my life by the apple juice seller manhatten
side and the guys with polystyrene cups want all your change and  I met a
bloody Kiwi in the MOMA, and in the trade Tower entrance there was a mural
by Miro, and there was a shop in Greenwich stocked with a huge variety of
condoms, and the Spanish or Spanish-Italian girls were excrutiatingly sexy,
and so were other women,  and there were cops with guns and cops on
horses(!), and shoe shiners, and the Sbarros I loved, and you could get beer
everywhere, and I was always drunk,and a woman about 28 was lying on the
pavement crying across from the Empire State and I "cracked up" in the
morning because I needed a chaser and had to be helped out of a retaurant
and missed my breakfast (an omelette I still miss it) and Macey's is
wonderfully old fashioned with a revolving door and if you see my "Cockroach
Poems" you'll know that the city is "vertiginous" and a Cockroach consults
with the editor of the New York Times.  Richard.

>pulls of (1) lunacy and (2) you are my sunshine.  Limbs drifting apart,
>the tongue sopping with unnoticed jingo-frisson, feet boinging along the

>QUID 8, now recommissioned by my book _Antifreeze_ as 'Ejector Vacua

>it (the P.A. had by this point broken down) at a London benefit for MSF,
>_Out of Bounds._  Perhaps in some distant repercussion this will count for
>more than I can credit.  But for now, in the universal highchair of the
>"double vacuum" (so politely undermultiplied by Amiri Baraka way back in
>1977: "No communist party, no national / leadership"), what do we do?
>Suck or blow?  No -wind- in the vacuum to piss against: try -that- again?
>To be idiomatic within a vacuum is a shining thing; to be vacuous in a
>plenary idiom is how we are now conscripted to do this, it's a kind of
>gluttonous fasting, Jerome on a diet of roasted peanuts in manic
>fast-forward, all chanting desperately and honestly and hatefully against
>the new season's injustice, cantors with gobs blue-tacked to the hollering
>brick wall.  Is irony in -this- way -essentially- a kind of clausal
>pile-up, or only -now-?  Box after box.  Vide Beckett: "It's vague, life
>and death."  As a matter of which the question trembles and flashes:
>what's the pass-concept to get out of the ultra-left margin to which poetry
>is categorically resigned?  Is the concept: poetry's materiality as the last
>blockade against the wholesale (rather than dialectical) complicity of
>consciousness with imperialism?  Is it: the valiant hermeneutic runaround
>once again fobbed off with a mere aura, this time by Agamben, that art is
>the unconcealing of humanity's essential rhythm on "the earth?" More about
>the earth later.  Perhaps the pass-concept is something to do with poetry
>and -the body-.  If the body is cognitive, if our habits and flinches are
>metaphysical and themselves a kind of knowledge, what is it exactly that
>we know?  Or could know, if the body's unconscious were plumbed?  ("The
>gall bladder has mountains; cliffs of fall / Frightful, sheer,
>no-man-fathomed. Hold them cheap / May who ne'er hung there.")  Knowledge
>within the vacuum has -vagueness- as its essential predicate.  Has the
>body, as now the fantastic vacuum is upsized, become -vaguer still-?
>Since -September 11th- I've found that I'm able to come only
>intermittently, not in the continuous Heraclitean flux of our former
>estrangement.  Animals sense these things.  A lioness whelped.  Horses
>neigh.  Ghosts shriek and squeal about the streets on CCTV.  Is this a
>prophecy?  Libidinal -Entausserung- "as" family planning?  Is my orgasm a
>fluent euphemism for bullet-spray, cut out by pacifist balls?  These and
>other questions perplex the man in the street now firming up for the mass

>linguistic innovation is the reconnaissance it always has been, setting
>the exam questions of the dream-world to come, scribbling out a brand new,
>fully-hope-fitted aeon.  But what -particularly- should poetry do, what
>schedule of leap / bound?  Is the ultra-left margin a kind of tugboat
>jettisoned into outer space?  The reintegration of high and low art
>forms, the convalescence dreamt by Adorno, might be key.  A return to the
>-whole- of culture, no longer (dixit Debord) "the meaning of an
>insufficiently meaningful world," but (qua Language Poetics) an
>anti-meaning of / as an always already sufficiently unmeaningful
>world-system.  If our -leaders- can do this, then we should make damn sure
>that poetry can keep up.  Kofi Annan was canny enough about the everyday
>to appear on Sesame Street:
>
>Annan stepped in when puppet character Elmo and his friends argued over
>who would get to sing the alphabet song.  In the end he persuaded them all
>to join in.  Afterwards he said it was "wonderful to reach out to young
>people" and hoped that he showed children "the spirit of the UN, a spirit
>of understanding, sharing and working together".   He said some
>politicians needed to be more like the characters in the show: "Elmo and
>his friends will tell us, it's the way they are, they tell it straight."
>"Keep it simple and it brings you back to earth. I think that is very
>important, we all need that."
>(BBC News, 7th Dec. 2001)
>
>
>We do, we need it.  The -return to earth- was suggested by another
>mediator, Ron Silliman, when he stepped into the still-trembling polemic
>vacuum to remind us that Bush might risk being -impeached- if he didn't
>mobilize the U.S. military-cultural complex against terrorism; the "left,"
>as Silliman understands it, would only isolate itself by "continuing on some
>mode of automatic pilot" to condemn military reaction, as if "traditional
>left-right dispute" still had any relevance.  A felicitous metaphor, but
>does Silliman go -far enough-?  Perhaps from his warnings we can take more
>elaborate heed, and ask the question he implies more directly: was the
>left -ever- anything but a mission of resentful mystifiers intent on
>self-alienation from the popular voice of injured patriotism?  What could
>Lenin possibly have said, faced with the Hellenic spectacle of G.W. Bush,
>a grown man, -almost beginning to weep- "when a reporter in the Oval
>Office asked him about his feelings"?   Revolutionary fervour is all good
>and well; but these are bad and sick times in which the very timelessness of
>humanity itself is at stake, its tears bouncing onto the faggot-heap of
>barbaric hatred.  Perhaps -this- is the exit-sign we've all been too
>hotheaded to notice.  Could it be that poetry must make a leap of good
>faith, out of the cynic's layby, out of the nil-stinking privet of intense
>dialectical consciousness, out of the fridge-magnet marginalia of the
>ultra-left, and back gloriously into the infinite fold of what Silliman
>reminds us is "the popular will?"  How else can poetry keep up the
>pretence to be democratic?  Are we big enough to admit it, that we've
>spent long enough groping in finical misery after a language of consummate
>vivid resistance, and that all this time we've had our heads buried in the
>sand like a bunch of Iraqis on the Basra Road?  Are we big enough also to
>take the lead in this return to earth from its natural origin, the big
>country itself, the big culture amongst whose avant-garde Silliman is a
>respected pioneer, the big-hearted U.S.A.?
>
>The critical segue is unique and throatcatching, thus:  (1) when I was a
>child I threw myself about with perpetual clarity and fixation.  I am now
>broken with myself indistinct and without poise.  I don't know what
>sincerity can mean.  Tell me precisely how to be afraid of vulnerability:

>sense.  (2) I listened when I woke up today, my head hurting and my throat

I think the poem is quite lovely.  So what if Christian Bok (whom I like a
great deal) has done a whole book of them?  Petrarch wrote some sonnets
too, and then so did some other folks later on...

NY City George, thats where. Usually when the city isnt named, it's NYC.
Sometines, though, it can be Cleveland, or even Oshkosh. But you can usually
bet it's NYC. I guess they dont care whether you show up or not. I  still
love you. David

sadness of world askew


we're thrown to a halt, run out, stop traffic. she's sitting there. all
among the fairest; suffice if one voice of the cars and trucks slow
around.

any darkness, weather, i'd say that we, on mangrove roots, closeup:
barnacles, limpets, mussels, mangroved say eternity, if animals still
roamed free, if there were animals, oysters, worm tubings. i dream of
land's end images, they claw at me, a god was here, so glorious in
us, all among the fairest; message down in the water of the continent.

down with bodies floating in the stream of stories. If you drown,
it is data you drown; if you write, you're written. write and you drown;
the cacti vines, looking grafted, even over, of the web of eternal life,
a number of deaths, swallow-tailed kites high above turkey buzzards,
cormorant perch suffice in my contrary red white black of twist.

if you get death, there are countries full of them, the ink, your lungs
of darkness and dark ink.

creatur pink flux in hole to the foot. ... ...  belief in atomic light ...
... mouthtime.

i know i can count on you and i promise i will never let you down, heart
shatter and your child her period, our country, its dark mouth.

I dont know: my point to Tony is that (he's obsessed with numbers eg once in
a conversation he postulated the the number 3 was the strongest) and
searching for some transcendental thing to come through the word formations
... but I'm not sure: he spends ages on these things: the problem for me is
as always: "Why are we(you/anyone) doing this?" Especially as otheres have
done it: as   a techncal exercise maybe: but there has to be for me some
"deeper" rationale...and the thing about Perec is that he wrote only one
book (witout the e) so he realised I'd say that that had been done) ... and
each book he wrote had a different "angle" and so on...but I thought I'd
pass it on: the guy is very well-meaning. I'm not interested in poetry taht
is complex in the sense of these poems: its a bit like those quizes where
you describe something but arent allowed to repeat a word: its abit like a
Chess game or a mathematical puzzle or a complex crossword: fun but a bit
meaningless.  Art poetry etc I feel has to_ try_ to do something: even if it
cant....something deeper has to under pin the work...but I dont
know...Richard.

I'll rlay that to Tony: actualy I havent had trime to read it (closely):
sometimes I "dig" Tony's poems and I feel he has ability but then I'm not so
sure: there are certain writers over here am sure are quite brilliant eg
Michael Arnold (New Zealand poet/teacher/philos grad).... (in fact reading
Michael's work I sometimes feel that I'm reading a latter day  Skaespeare (I
mean in terms of ability) but sometimes I cant sort others: or maybe they
are just diffferent. But thanks for your thought. Richard. PS I dont know
Christain Blok... father forgive me....

Thanks , David.

But here is what I am going to do: when they dont mention what city
the event is going to be in, I am going to assume Saskatoon.

I have long been a big fan of OuLiPo and am proud to be in the Oulipo
compendium, so I am no enemy of this kind of practice. I dfid find
the piece interesting. Yr remarks on numbers are interesting, as half
the Oulipo people are mathematicians. You did know that Perec created
puzzles for daily papers and these are collected in a couple volumes?

My brother was a great puzzle man and good at Maths (he's an Industrial
Chemist in Townsville Aussie): he once solved solitaire and wrote out a
formula for it and so on...but I learnt to play Chess (actually he was
naturally better at Chess as well but took up soccer and boozing!) quite
well but Chess requires a different knd of ability (a lot of it is learning
and practicing what are known as tactical combinations in one's mind: and
there is also strategical principles and planning (very hard, endgames, and
learning openings (most imortant for very high level players)) but I'm not
into that sort of thing else (I mean puzzles) - but I'd be keen to see (I
have some in one of my books of Perec's puzzles)...Perec fascinates me...I
like looking at his photograph on the book:  I like very much the books I
have recently by Perec and am enjoying reading him when I can: I like the
sort of thing he does and also Robbett-Grillet is a favourite: in fact
Grillet and Beckett are two big influences on me: I also feel there's
probably a link to Raymond Rousell's writings (I mean to Perec and maybe
others): I've read "Locus Solus" and "Impressions D"Afrique" (in
English).... but I love Grillett.  Some poems I wrote were based on it. I'll
let Tony know that some interest was created by what he is doing. Another
New Zealand poet, Richard von Sturmer, is very interested in the Oulipo
Group ( he visits the US about 6 months a year to go to  a Zen Buddhist
retreat I believe)....  I like the idea of them: I am a bit dubious though
of ideas such that 3 is a strong number but of course that kind of thinking
is iteresting: trouble with Tony is that he "wanders" in his thoughts:  but
maybe if he was given a contact with the the Oulipo and a project he would
be very pleased...(he's fascinated by the mystery of things I think and a
bit tormented - his brother committed suicide and was  a strange but
possibly brilliant artist)  - but he can be quite cheerful and is a
good-hearted (youngish man) who has earnt money mainly through House
painting: but he also paints, does comedy books, and writes poems (some of
which despite my objections - that they are not "underpinned or whatever...)
acquire a strange beauty. Some arent so good:  I'll send anything else on
that's a bit  more substantial.  Thanks George and others, Richard.  PS I'd
probably use the puzzles and transform them into some kind of poem-puzzle!

It strikes me here that, while only "i" is used, there are at least
two distinct vowel sounds. Can anyone post a poem of approximately
the same length that uses only one vowel sound?

Oulipo is having an influence beyond literature. My sons came home from
their fourth grade math class talking about Oulipo, where the use of
"constrained writing forms" is being used to show how mathematics can apply
to the "real" world.

I dont know: my point to Tony is that (he's obsessed with numbers eg once in
a conversation he postulated the the number 3 was the strongest) and
searching for some transcendental thing to come through the word formations
... but I'm not sure: he spends ages on these things: the problem for me is
as always: "Why are we(you/anyone) doing this?" Especially as otheres have
done it: as   a techncal exercise maybe: but there has to be for me some
"deeper" rationale...and the thing about Perec is that he wrote only one
book (witout the e) so he realised I'd say that that had been done) ... and
each book he wrote had a different "angle" and so on...but I thought I'd
pass it on: the guy is very well-meaning. I'm not interested in poetry taht
is complex in the sense of these poems: its a bit like those quizes where
you describe something but arent allowed to repeat a word: its abit like a
Chess game or a mathematical puzzle or a complex crossword: fun but a bit
meaningless.  Art poetry etc I feel has to_ try_ to do something: even if it
cant....something deeper has to under pin the work...but I dont
know...Richard.

I have long been a big fan of OuLiPo and am proud to be in the Oulipo
compendium, so I am no enemy of this kind of practice. I dfid find
the piece interesting. Yr remarks on numbers are interesting, as half
the Oulipo people are mathematicians. You did know that Perec created
puzzles for daily papers and these are collected in a couple volumes?

Marjorie Perloff
The Cake Shops on the Nevsky:
Ezra Pound as Nominalist

For several years Marjorie Perloff has been one of the most
engaged critics of the avant-garde either through her incisive
study of Italian Futurism or championing new poetry in
America and elsewhere. In "The Cake Shops on the Nevsky:
Ezra Pound as Nominalist." Perloff proposes a fresh look at
Pound's highly idiosyncratic use of proper names, especially
in the Pisan Cantos, arguing that Poundian aesthetic is not,
as is so often claimed, Confucian or NeoPlatonic but
inherently Nominalist; it is concerned less with large truths
than with the discrimination of difference. Along the way,
Perloff will show the relationship of Pound's nominalism to
that of his exact contemporary and acquaintance, Marcel
Duchamp.

One of the reasons I like the poem is because of the (well-handled) sci fi
element.  I like sci fi and I like poetry, but these are usually two
separate enthusiasms.  Anyone know of other places/poems where they come
together sucessfully?  I've often thought I might write something about
George Oppen's use of the Robert Heinlein epigraph for This In Which.  The
Heinlein book (The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag) is quite
interesting...

I am crushed by this news...I do hope she's not dropping the form because
the form is hopeless, yielding nothing. Surely, she must still desire to
engage in dispossessing writers of the means of production and transmission,
making them make their point in short segments, by all manner of tricks and
subterfuges, as witnessed by her distillations of Tony M.'s books over these
last, many years!

I am at least consoled to hear that she will not totally abandon her
wondrously polished dumbing-down technique...at least on occasion consenting
to flog a book or two.

In the meantime...what are we to do?

actually -- and while taking a look at the pedogogy surrounding the
fibonacci sequence, mind you -- there's a pretty long history of using
poetry as a demo in math, so I've found a lot of math limericks,
mathematical formulas that when "read" rhyme, remember the Bart Simpson
gifted school math joke?, and poem (rather than story) problems

WHAT:
Beyond Baroque Hosts
THE BIG PICTURE: A Convocation Of Southern California Poets

WHEN:
Sunday, April 7th, 2002 at 2:00 p.m.

WHERE:
BEYOND BAROQUE LITERARY ARTS CENTER
681 Venice Blvd.,
Venice, CA
(310) 822-3006

ADMISSION:
Free of charge!

On Sunday, April 7th, 2002, at 3:00 p.m., Beyond Baroque will host The Big
Picture, a convocation of published Southern California poets to be
photographed for National Poetry Month.

Southern California is a region of diverse populations, each with a unique
voice. For this event, we are bringing all these voices together--the
voices of our literary poets, our performance poets, our beat poets,
avant-garde poets, academic poets, hip-hop poets, environmental poets,
political poets, cowboy poets, and others. Often regions are not aware of
their cultural heritage. This is our change to preserve these poets for
posterity.

The event will take place at Beyond Barque, the non-profit foundation that
is the literary heart of Los Angeles. Founded in 1968 in a storefront in
Venice, the center has been the site of readings from such literary giants
and local icons as Allen Ginsberg, Philip Levine, David St. John, Kate
Braverman, Lewis MacAdams, Bob Flanagan, Charles Bukowski, Wanda Coleman,
Dennis Cooper, and many more. Many of SoCal's most beloved poets have been
alumnae of Beyond Baroque's longstanding workshops.

The event is being documented by Mark Savage, who is completed a five-year
project individually photographing the poets of Los Angeles. Called one of
the "finest up-and-coming portrait photographers in North America" by
American Photography, Savage's work has appeared in the Los Angeles Times,
MONEY, Fortune, and other publications. After the group photo, all poets
will be invited to visit his project, "Souls and Passions," on display at
the Beyond Baroque gallery.

In addition, participating poets will be donating copies of their
publications to the Beyond Baroque Archive, the largest independent
collection of Southern California poetry and ephemera on the West Coast.

TED'S FAVORITE SKIRT

a novel

by Lewis Warsh

$14.00   ISBN 1-881471-78-0

"The heroine is a hoops-shooting Madame Bovary-reading American kid
trying to figure it all out. As we follow Billie in and out of love,
limning with her the edges of despair and hope, Warsh leads us deep into
the 'hum of human machinery', a territory where all but essentials
are weeded out. Part bildungsroman, part commentary on American life
in the 80s, Ted's Favorite Skirt is a trenchant, lovely wonder."
Laird Hunt

"Lewis Warsh writes from a true and complex idea of experience, and
does so in the certainty that we know what life is about. Ted's Favorite
Skirt, remarkable for its steady luminosity and insight, reveals the
mystery--though not its solution--of how someone's presence can weave
itself into the fabric of our desire and remain there, long after the
time shared with that person has passed, and thus become part of
our fate."

 Hi all,

A bit of self-promotion from me... just thought I'd let you know my
new book 'Winter District' is out now from Potes & Poets Press (US).

The isbn is 1-893541-46-0

And the price is US $8.00

Big thanks to Potes & Poets.

Best,

Cassie Lewis

Behold the multitude of forms that dance through the streets of this
cosmopolis! Free agent Mark DuCharme is the architect of an awesome city of
words sometimes tender, sometimes tough, always wonderful to wander through.
                                              --Lisa Jarnot


Mark DuCharme's poems in COSMOPOLITAN TREMBLE say astonishing things. That
is the "business" of poems: to say astonishing things. Some poems say
astonishing things once in a while, some with greater frequency, some hardly
ever. Of course, it all depends on what the reader may or may not find
astonishing. Some readers may be more easily astonished than some others.
Personally, I don't think I am all that easily astonished. To get back to
the subject of this note, I find that Mark DuCharme's poems say astonishing
things practically ALL THE TIME ! By that I mean that they really keep me
awake. From the expansive vistas of the title sequence, on through the more
jagged and mysterious ones of <Desire Series> and the cinema noir of <X
(secret fuel)>, to the coda of <Anything It Could Be>, Mark DuCharme takes
us on a Long March, a Wild Trip, a Civilized Orgy of Cognitive Dissonance,
whatever that means, well it means these poems are great serious fun to read
and reread, and I urge you to do so.
                                              --Anselm Hollo

The domestic is a crash test in Mark DuCharme's party-of-the-first-part
telling. He outs "Genders of the obvious" and gets into "Gestures capped in
answerable wool." The "desire" in this series is warier than that of, say,
Barthes, where it is "taxidermy" which is "lovely" and where "The heart
being nothing/ Agitates slightly."
                                              --Michael Gizzi

Zip and sharp wit drive this new collection of Mark DuCharme's. It's a
brainy engagement with the real world expanded by the forces of
language--"In weather's pearlish mystery," "In purer emblems of a tumbling
incitement," "In the genre of kissing or falling down," DuCharme finds a
world full of acute emotion and vivid experience, and recounts it with a
freshness you can almost hear aloud.
                                              --Cole Swensen

WHAT:
Beyond Baroque Hosts
THE BIG PICTURE: A Convocation Of Southern California Poets

WHEN:
Sunday, April 7th, 2002 at 2:00 p.m.

WHERE:
BEYOND BAROQUE LITERARY ARTS CENTER
681 Venice Blvd.,
Venice, CA
(310) 822-3006

ADMISSION:
Free of charge!

On Sunday, April 7th, 2002, at 3:00 p.m., Beyond Baroque will host The Big
Picture, a convocation of published Southern California poets to be
photographed for National Poetry Month.

Southern California is a region of diverse populations, each with a unique
voice. For this event, we are bringing all these voices together--the
voices of our literary poets, our performance poets, our beat poets,
avant-garde poets, academic poets, hip-hop poets, environmental poets,
political poets, cowboy poets, and others. Often regions are not aware of
their cultural heritage. This is our change to preserve these poets for
posterity.

The event will take place at Beyond Barque, the non-profit foundation that
is the literary heart of Los Angeles. Founded in 1968 in a storefront in
Venice, the center has been the site of readings from such literary giants
and local icons as Allen Ginsberg, Philip Levine, David St. John, Kate
Braverman, Lewis MacAdams, Bob Flanagan, Charles Bukowski, Wanda Coleman,
Dennis Cooper, and many more. Many of SoCal's most beloved poets have been
alumnae of Beyond Baroque's longstanding workshops.

The event is being documented by Mark Savage, who is completed a five-year
project individually photographing the poets of Los Angeles. Called one of
the "finest up-and-coming portrait photographers in North America" by
American Photography, Savage's work has appeared in the Los Angeles Times,
MONEY, Fortune, and other publications. After the group photo, all poets
will be invited to visit his project, "Souls and Passions," on display at
the Beyond Baroque gallery.

In addition, participating poets will be donating copies of their
publications to the Beyond Baroque Archive, the largest independent
collection of Southern California poetry and ephemera on the West Coast.

Actually, an old joke--not Canadian, but Scottish humor; Biggar, Scotland
(where Hugh MacDiarmid spent many of his last days) has as motto "London is

Hi,

Many thanks to all who responded to my index query. To
clarify, George and Murat are correct: I was asking
about examples of poems/writing that have an index as
their form, not works that have an index. I was
specifically thinking of an index to an imaginary book
or a found index without pagination. Nevertheless, I
am grateful to all who answered.

Pete

 various, Ron,  Listologists.  That;s good: I'm not a great mathematician
(not even particularlyg "good" at maths as they say) but I had to do some
when I did a Certificate in Engineering and used to coach about 5th Form
Maths (here the students anre about 14 or 15,16 or so) and read a lot of
poplular maths books..and often I'd digress onto ideas I'd picked up ... one
point being to make the subject interesting: which it can be...maths has an
enormous range of applications: but  a huge area is of course pure maths and
people in that level are like poets. And reversing that: poetry can be
"useless" but by linking the two useful and useless become relative to what
you want things to do for you (which leads back to my aswer to Murat (re
intrinsic value etc) that eg a garden can have an intrinsic value but if the
flowers of that garden are sold or the visitors to it are charged it becomes
part of the production cycle: they become commodities - hence a poet is a
commodity producer only if he/she receives money or something for poems (or
exchanged)...and then turning back to the Oulipo the use of language is the
great pleasure it can give (which if it does students make work more
concentratedly and thus "get a good job" (nothing wrong with that), but also
they may be seeing that poetry and art or whatever and music link
(indirectly) to maths: in the sense we all know of beats per line and the
restraint (more so with eg Bach but maybe not quite with eg Cage (athough
even Cage is working inside a structure ..even Ives is: its just that its
more difficult for most people to see it: they might worry about the concept
of natural noise but music probably arose because we are aware of this
"natural" noise (the wind and so on or nowadays the street) and so no matter
how a poem is structured (in fact the poem I wrote in which I took random
quotes I discovered that a kind of "rhythm" was developing: its almost as if
the human agency cannot avoid imposing some kind of structure and thus a
signification even if that is subliminal and thus or_or_stimulating or
challenging and so on  through to something that is "useful" or "tells a
story" and that telling is what we have done ages: done ages....certain
"themes" repeat even if you felt you ( I ) was inserting things quite
randomly: the "pattern" is imposed I think by probability (as concepts will
be 'found' in any text) or the mind 'automatically" chooses sertain more
significant things to write or "put in" any text (the other extreme is  work
planned to the last "t" ... but even such a work (by a mathematical law)
will develop "randomness" to a leser or later dgree: obviously Shakespeares
sonnets are petty tightly controlled adnd planned and structures yet what
determines certain words over others....or certain phrases...and some of
these will have been "creative mistakes".
    So lets potualte that mathematics becomes less "cold and "logical" and
possibly more poetical or the other way around: or cold and logical are
found to be beautiful by those dubious of maths and technical ore maths
people of the "more rigorous logical kind"  (of course this is a predjudice
about mathematicians but I;m trying to use a contrast here)  look at poetry
s mathematical or just intersting or as music. In the future it may be found
that poetry is as essential as mathematics even for an aggressive capitalist
system: but in a more advanced age we may find many thjngs conflating more
often: fewer people worried or baffled by boundaries..greater mental health
and creativity everywhere.  A Utopian ideal maybe but Ithink it has
possibilities: when a lecturer told me that Heidegger 9and I read) he
soughta "solution" to social-political ills etc through poets andoetry Iw as
quite skeptical ..but I'm less so now .... I'm not wanting here to go into
the problem of  Heidegger the nazi and the one who wouldnt relent to Celan
(circa Pierre Joris's discussion of that) ...but some of his ideas on
technology nad natue  and society...but...
   Well Spicer's poem:  "The ocean ,humiliating inits disguises..." that's
got to be amongst other things by repetition, line breaks, theme, in a way
it "pumps" like the sea: a  poetamathical sea.  Some thoughts. Richard.

Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi y'all,

a long while back, probably a couple of years or so, there was some
discussion on the list about the Polish movie Saragossa Manuscript
directed by Wojciech Has.

I'm not sure who all was interested back then, or if they're still on
the list, but thought it'd be worth noting that the film has recently
been re-issued on DVD. The transfer is very good, and it's the
three-hour long uncut version rather than the shorter version that
was usually shown in the US back in the day.

The film is based on a Polish novel by Jan Potocki from the 18th
century and has a complexly nested narrative about a Flemish
soldier's adventures with spirits, devils and very odd characters.
The movie is gorgeous, filled with striking black & white imagery,
long tracking shots of weird landscapes and interiors, all presented
with a nicely textured ironic tone.

I don't know if this restored version of the film is available in
other formats.

Bests,

Herb

I really, really wish that people would stop mis-using Cage as a
model for their own vaguely considered ideas about randomness and use
of ambient sounds etc.

Yeah, 4:33 is an important work, & yeah,m he used the I Ching a lot,
but Cage wrote more than 200 compositions, very few of which are in
any meaningful way random.

What he did more than anything else was continually develop new
strategies for making structures that subverted his own tastes when
it came to issues of choosing notes, timings, etc. For the most part
these involved converting one set of observed patterns or data into
choices of sounds. For each of these works, he remained entirely
consistent with whatever conversion system he had devised. In many
cases, his music is nearly as over-determined as total serial music.

Whatever else, Cage most certainly had little interest in something
along the lines of

>the mind 'automatically" chooses sertain more significant things to
>write or "put in" any text

and, in his own processes, wouldn't see this as necessarily being the
opposite of

>work planned to the last "t"

For Cage, I think, in both instances the creator is quite likely to
be following their own interests and habits, which is what he tried
more than anything else to avoid doing.

Richard,

Exactly. That's why I am trying to split the writing itself (process) from
its life after it. In principle, I have no objection to art's responding to
its environment, culture. In fact, such a connection, I think, enriches the
art, makes it at least indirectly indirectly (that's what your are partly
talking about in this post, Richard) a mirror of its time. But: such a
connection is so tenuous in poetry, at least in the States (that's what my
money argument is all about), that its pursuit verges on delusion. The poet
can transform this state of "weakness" into power (psychic power, "I play at
Riches - to appease/ The Clamoring for Gold, Emily Dickinson) by choosing to
turn away from it. This turn grants the poet, if he or she can embrace it,
during the writing, absolute freedom. Seeing poetry as a process (here one
can see the J. Cage/R. Foreman thread, Richard) is the poet's act of self
empowerment, a move to throw away one's chains. An analytic act to gain class
consciousness, the result of which poems become continuous, repetitive,
discrete acts of unlearning, and not a craft to be learnt and mastered or
attempts to "enrich" a tradition.


Of course, as a human being, a poet may and often does bitch about not being
recognized or worry if he or she is going to be read in the future. But this
has nothing to do with the writing of the poem itself. I think one can not
become a poet, at least in the capitalist States if not in many other places
also, without embracing this difficult, painful split. Only then, does the
nature (the class place) of poetry in our culture becomes clear: language as
play, as mental weaving (something viscerally visual, mind's eye), as
process, contra language as use, as function.

As mental weaving, poetry has a similarity with math. And, like math, a poem
may or may not gain a social significance (function, value, becoming part of
language as criticism, as ads, etc. ) in the future, as a math system may
have application in physics, for instance. But the possibility of future
function can not intrude during the process. Can a "pure" mathematician do
math while his or her focus is on its possible use. I doubt it; in fact, such
a double focus may make math impossible The same way, a poem can not be
written while part of the question it's asking is related to value, "is it
good, is it innovative, is it daring, is it relevant." A poet, I believe,
must learn to respond to his or her own interests, has to go wherever he or
she has to go.

In relation to Oulipud and recent discussions on math: in the Islamic east
(and medieval, Andalusian Judaism) math has connections to mysticism, which
the modern association of math with science partly obscures. This mystical
connection of course is also in Pythagorean Greece. Since the 17th century
this side of math has become almost forbidden knowledge.

Isn't Newton's calculus (the first major application of math to use, to
science) an attempt to solve the problem of infinite regressions (Zeno's
paradox), which is also the heart of Pythagorean golden mean (infinite series
of regressive triangles). With "limits," Newton tries to go around the
impossibility of division by zero, an impossibility which also generates the
concept of inifinty. In other words, finding a use for math, connecting it to
science required a going around, a "repression" of a frontal confrontation
with infinity. The ghost of this repression haunts the beginnings of modern
science, many early practitioners of which (Kepler, Newton) were mystics.

Poetry also (at least in the States) is that ghost language, which in its
writing must be unfettered, infinitely possible; which, once it gains a
social "function," its essence inevitably undergoes a repression.

"Several days later I realized I have no time for technique because I must
always be making one: any technique can be discovered after any technique is
forgotten." John Cage "45' for a Speaker".

Even other process oriented authors like Burroughs and the fold-ins, Mac Low
with the computers, or Tzara's hat trick are all methods of trying to
distance the personality of the author from the object of the text.

The School for Atheists
A Novella =3D Comedy in 6 Acts
Arno Schmidt
Translated from the German by John E Woods
Green Integer ($16.95)

From Rain Taxi
by Steven Moore

For those who have been following Arno Schmidt's erratic appearances in =
English translation over the last 20 years, the publication  of The =
School for Atheists is cause for celebration. This is one of the =
"hyper-books" Schmidt wrote during his last decade, an oversized volume =
with elaborate page layouts, illustrations, and Schmidt's unique, highly =
expressive style of punctuation. At 301 pages it's no novella, but it =
does resemble a play and is definitely a comedy.
     First published in 1972, The School is set mostly in the year 2014, =
with an extended flashback to the summer of 1969, when a band of =
atheists had their lack of faith tested (a clever reversal of the =
tradition test-of-faith topos). The action takes place in a =
"reservation" in northern Germany at a time when two superpowers rule =
the globe: a matriarchal United States and a patriarchal China, =
representatives from which converge on the reservation for a summit. At =
the center of the novel is a typical Schmidt protagonist, a 75-year-old =
justice of the peace named Kolderup, who shares Schmidt's own fantastic =
erudition and iconoclastic views. Living with him are two "arsch damsels =
of Seven=3DTeen," his daughter Suse and her friend Nipperchen, whose =
romantic escapades provide most of the comedy in this sex farce.
     Schmidt was one of the few writers who valiantly attempted to pick =
up where Joyce left off, using Finnegans Wake as a model for his own =
punning, multilingual, polymorphously perverse prose. It takes some =
getting used to--be prepared to spend about ten minutes on the first =
page--but once you acclimatize yourself to it, Schmidt's prose is a =
delightful concoction (or "cunt=3Dcock=3Dshun," as Schmidt would say) of =
double entendres, learned allusions, and phonetically rendered speech, =
all heroically translated by the fantastic John E. Woods. Though not as =
difficult as Finnegans Wake, the novel likewise tosses many languages =
into a word salad, using etymologies and puns to explore hidden =
connections and tensions (often sexual) between signifiers and their =
signifieds.
     Like Robert Musil, Schmidt is a German writer of the first rank =
whose tardy appearance in English translation has kept him from being as =
well known in America as his countrymen Mann, Grass, Boll, and others. =
But enough Schmidt is now available that readers who consider themselves =
au courant with innovative, experimental fiction have no excuse for not =
knowing this literary giant. The School for Atheists is a good place to =
start.   [Rain Taxi, VII, 1 (Spring 2002), page 10]

Green Integer also publishes Schmidt's Radio Dialogs 1 ($12.95).

Both these books are now available to people on this list and the =
Poetics list for a 20%
discount. Send $13.56 + $1.50 for shipping =3D $15.06 for The School for =
Atheists and/or

1. The Short Answer

In his book Nicholodeon, Darren Wershler-Henry produces a version of
bpNichol's "Translating Translating Apollinaire" using the Klingon
language, "Translating[n] Apollinaire 10: Klingon." I think that
Nicholodeon is out of print now, but you can see an online version of the
book at the Coach House Books website
<http://www.chbooks.com/online/nicholodeon/>. I've never been so fortunate
as to see him read the poem, though I know that he does so periodically,
e.g. at the first Boston Alternative Poetry Conference back in '98.

From DWH's Surplus Explanations: "This poem is written in grammatically
correct Klingon, the most successful artifical language in history. There
are some allowances here for poetic usage; since Klingon contains no
equivalent for the word 'car,' for example, this text reads 'primitive
shuttlecraft.' The characters themselves are not conventional Klingon, but
those of a small splinter colony, the Klinzhai; they bear a striking
resemblance to Hebrew script."

2. The Long-Winded, Barely Coherent Conjecture

Actually, I hope this isn't too incoherent, but caveat lector: I'm very
tired after last night's DJ Spooky show.

What I find particularly successful in this case is that Wershler-Henry
eschews sci-fi as a theme, managing instead to take up something of its
speculative methodology: "okay, the language exists, so what if we do
this...." Whereas the thematic impulse risks introducing new material into
a poetic milieu that stands unchanged, Wershler-Henry's treatment is
experimental at the most fundamental level. Poetry doesn't escape the basic
consequences of meddling with popular science fiction, but the dislocation
that comes of that meddling is itself a joyous occasion.

Too, that I really enjoy the conjunctive nature of the enterprise: more and
more I wonder whether poetry's intensest points don't lie in its axes with
other (loosely-termed) systems and procedures. OULIPO and mathematics, as
in the current thread - or Zukofsky and mathematics - certainly Zukofsky
and music - Mac Low's work with aleatory procedures and generative
constraints - John Cage's procedural compositions -

and here I'd like to nod toward Herb Levy's comment (Sat, 6 Apr 2002
07:25:41 -0600) that

- Marianne Moore's use of the library/archive - strike me as logical
extensions of, say, Emily Dickinson's relationship to the dictionary and to
the personal letter. Some will perceive these as relatively conservative
examples, but I guess that's where I'm coming from right now - and then
again, experimental is as experimental does. (Poets have always known to
read each other despite the silly academic issue of canonicity, since
poetry lives substantially outside of the academy, though it can find the
academy useful. Topic for another day.) I know that DWH locates himself in
terms of a very different genealogy (except for the OULIPO) but perhaps not
exclusively; in any case, one could position all of these works in terms of
their reach toward the inclusion of heterogenous technologies in the broad
sense. As Raymond Queneau makes clear, all writing is technological before
the fact; even the concept of "the human" has its own history and
limitations. (Queneau doesn't say that, precisely. Queneau says
"inspiration which consists in blind obedience to every impulse is in
reality a sort of slavery. The classical playwright is freer than the poet
who writes [whatever] comes into his head and who is the slave of other
rules of which he is ignorant." Cf. Motte's OULIPO: A Primer of Potential
Literature, p. 41) Poetry is technical: a function of rhythms and melodies
that oftent have little to do with speech, unnatural vocabularies and
formative tropes, syntax and schema, themes; the centuries-ongoing
crystallization of assumptions, acts of forgetting, discoveries. The
writers in the above, very abbreviated list introduce new tools or new
relations to old tools - some of which come from outside the order of what
had been considered, at the moment, the orthodox toolbox for poetry. All of
them work with tools other than - or with other tools in addition to -
received forms on the one hand, and language as an expressive function on
the other. At the time, for example, there was nothing obvious about
Dickinson's particular relationship to the dictionary; cf. Letters vol. 2
#261: "for several years, my Lexicon - was my only companion." In any case,
the results of this companionship certainly weren't obvious to Higginson,
who intimated that she ought to bring her work under control. Letter #265:

     You think my gait "spasmodic" - I am in danger - Sir -
     You think me "uncontrolled" - I have no Tribunal.

Letter #271:

     I think you called me "Wayward."

Talk of Dickinson's desire/need to control herself - a gendered as well as
a formal issue - extends all the way into contemporary scholarship, as if
bent on demonstrating just how poorly the bulk of editors, biographers, and
critics read. (Not dissimilarly, Moore is taught in many cases as a
second-rank nature poet: inexpert at what she is not doing.) Letter #449,
again addressing Higginson's incomprehension: "Could 'Liquid Hills' be
steep?" What could Higginson know of the joys attending the discovery that
Avalanche and Avenue occurred in adjacent columns in the 1848 edition of
Webster's Dictionary?

Taken in the foregoing company, "Translating[n] Apollinaire" instructs us
that the systems with which poetry can interface remain heterogenous: that
it's useful to pass beyond the tools that have come to seem obvious to us
at present. DWH again: "The poems in NICHOLODEON were written out of the
conviction that we only use language because we haven't got anything that
works better." It reminds us that there is a whole lot of outside waiting
to get in, possibilities teeming like zombies in Night of the Living Dead.
Dammit! It blows our chances of relaxing in front of the poetv. In fact,
DWH's tools extend past the linguistic to the mechanical, as in his use of
fonts-as-translation (compare Pierre Joris' superfantastic "5 Translations
from Arthur Rimbaud's Une Saison en Enfer," made by writing the poems over
a sheet of scratch-off letters) or "Deskjetsam," which is evidently the
result of cruelty to his HP Deskjet. These procedures may strike some
readers as simple, but that reaction could be attributed in turn to
discomfort with what they have to tell us. For one thing, my phrase
"conjunctive enterprise" isn't quite accurate, implying as it does a linear
model A | B = C: "Translating Apollinaire" | Klingon = "Translating[n]
Apollinaire 10: Klingon." (The pipe character | will be familiar to users
of Unix or Linux as a command to "pipe" data resulting from one operation
into another program.) If it were the whole consequence of this work that
we could translate poems written in one language into various other sign-
and data-systems, I wouldn't be so interested. "Translating[n] Apollinaire"
is, obviously, a series of translations. But, perhaps less obviously, it is
a *series* of translations, a poem comprised of serial translations of the
same text - and therefore, oddly enough, not itself a translation in any
usual sense of the word. Whereas we might think of translation as, very
roughly, the act of carrying a made thing into a new system (semantic or
otherwise), "Translating[n] Apollinaire" finds DWH folding a number of
heterogenous systems into the poem as an act of composition. Rather than n
renditions of one poem, we have one poem constructed by a successive
passage into n systems. The distinction is crucial in terms of bringing the
poem round to meet the works mentioned earlier: it looks toward writing as
a process incorporating heterogenous materials by means other than
reference or theme. Whatever sense or significance we could attach to DWH's
use of Klingon, for instance, is secondary to the fact of its having been
one of the available tools. As the title given to DWH's notes to the piece
indicates, explanations are surplus.

At the same time, DWH's work provides an interesting contrast to the works
mentioned earlier in that it does not produce a new work in English - or
not until someone translates "Translating[n] Apollinaire." But to consider
this point would be to take up the poem in its relation to bpNichol's
enterprise, something Christian Bok has already done in "Nickel Linoleum"
<http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bok/nickel.html>.

This is getting too long for a piece of email, anyway.

The Autonomedia/Semiotext(e) SF anthology of 10 or 12 years ago (I think
the title is just plain _SF_) had some poems in it, one by Hakim Bey/Peter
Lamborn Wilson. Couldn't vouch for their "success" as I don't have the book
at hand. But I enjoyed the book, at the time LRSN

Hello!  It's Christine again -

I just wanted to announce a few more things related to The Big Picture on
Sunday. This is in Venice, California.

If you are in Los Angeles or the SF Valley -

TUNE IN TONIGHT - Steering Committee Chair and main organizer Amelie Frank,
and also mark Savage Photographer will be on KXLU Los Angeles - 88.9 FM
tonight from 8 to 9 PM. This Saturday April 6th!

They will discuss the significance and richness of the SoCal poetry
landscape, perhaps from a historical standpoint, but definitely in it's
current state :-)

Also this evening's show will be a tribute to John Thomas and Marta
Mitrovich, both of whom passed away last week.

!! At The Big Picture this Sunday, Gov. Davis is sending a rep. from the
California Arts Council to proclaim that April is California Poetry month
and laud the contributions both to the community and to the human spirit of
the act of writing and participating in poetry....

Once again, the website for this event is at:
http://www.beyondbaroque.org/bigpicture and it has a printable PDF file
with info you need to participate if you are a poet.  If you are not a poet
and want to volunteer, please show up around 1 PM and ask for Amelie Frank
and tell her you want to volunteer.

Please scroll down to read about John and Marta and also to read the
Proclamation :-)

Cheers!
Christine Palma

The links on the homepage of the Big Picture site has more about Marta and
John.

IN MEMORY:

This past Easter weekend, Southern California poetry lost two vital and
beloved members of the community.

Marta Mitrovich was a seminal figure in Orange County poetry, hosting the
long-running Laguna Poets series from its inception in the 1970s through
its first 20 years.

John Thomas was one of the original Venice Beats, who could claim
friendship with both Ezra Pound and Charles Bukowski while carving his own
significant niche in the Los Angeles poetry scene over the last 30 years.
We will be dedicating The Big Picture, with love, to their memory.

GOVERNOR DAVIS DECLARES APRIL 2002 -
"CALIFORNIA POETRY MONTH"

SACRAMENTO -Governor Davis today declared April 2002, "California Poetry
Month," to encourage members of the community to participate in
California's cultural life and contribute to the State's literary heritage.

"Poetry allows language to free our imaginations and expand our creative
horizons," Governor Davis said. "It offers opportunities for those seeking
self-knowledge, but it especially encourages children to discover the
wealth of language and expression in their own lives."

Sunday, April 7, more than 300 poets from all over Southern California will
be gathering at the Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center for a historic
celebration of poetry. Steven Fogel, immediate past chair of the California
Arts Council, will deliver comments and this proclamation.

These artists will be photographed at the event as a display of Southern
California published poets to celebrate National Poetry Month.

Throughout the month of April, poetry will be read, performed and discussed
by thousands of individuals and organizations within the State. "California
Poetry Month" celebrates literature and, specifically, raises the
importance of poetry.

3. Briefer Unwieldy Conjecture

Or back to the keyboard for one final note. In Christian Bok's
review-essay, he says:

"Wershler-Henry suggests that such a new poetics must dramatize the effect
of artificial discourses--and nowhere does this premise appear more obvious
than during his use of the Klingon language to create a sci-fi
lautgedichte. Such a text implies that, in the modern milieu, poetry has
become so heteroclite, so nonsensical, that it is now little more than an
alien idiom, like the hieroglyphs of a Klinzhai alphabet, its characters
unreadable, except in the neverland of speculative imagination: 'since
Klingon contains no equivalent for the word 'car,' [...] this text reads
'primitive shuttlecraft'' (1997a:[90]).
    Wershler-Henry also suggests that a new poetics must dramatize the
effects of mechanical procedures...."
("Nickel Linoleum" <http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bok/nickel.html>)

While I'm substantially in agreement with the notion that poetry has an
integral but too-little-understood relationship to "artificial discourses"
and "mechanical procedures," I'd want to make a shift away from the idea
that systemic interference needs to be "dramatized" - which says to me,
converted (-ized) into something that is done for the audience, something
demonstrated - toward the idea that they need to be used. Perhaps it's just
my errant nature, but I've always found the assumptions that we make about
our relationship to audience a little backwards: after all - and I take it
that here I'm in some measure of basic agreement with Murat's desire "to
split the writing itself (process) from its life after it" (Sat, 6 Apr 2002
10:24:51 EST) - I just don't believe that good art is made with the
audience in mind. Good art comes with attention to sensations, not signs;
even if signs are usually (not always) involved. That's why, to respond to
a question recently overheard, the avant garde isn't always (ever)
pedagogical - though it's true that we as readers are always trying to
catch up with the writers we love. Compare DWH's insistence, cited by Bok,
"that language is a cyborganic phenomenon, in which we do not translate
words into meaning so much as dissipate forms into function."

To keep from hijacking Murat's phrase, I should say that the reasoning
behind my use of the statement is a bit different. It sometimes upsets
people when I say this, but I'm not much invested in either an abstract
concept of freedom or the human individual as the ultimate source of art -
including my own. On this point, I could mention Queneau again - even if
some of my writing practices look to be "procedural" in exactly the sense
he means to put down. The once and future history of writing is beginning
to look to me rather something more like Delanda's "human artisans playing
the role of historically necessary 'channelers' for the machinic phylum's
'creativity.'" (Cf. War in the Age of Intelligent Machines, page 8) That is
to say, one could write a non-human history of poetry as a self-organizing
process enfolding other such processes - e.g., the haphazard movement from
pen to typewriter to computer-generated acrostic; the haphazard movement
from letter to listserv. Which Is Not to apply a vague notion of
"evolution" in the sense of either a strictly linear development or
"betterment" - notions that seem to have little to do with Darwin. Nor is
it to overemphasize the role of computer technology, which though important
is not exclusive. Drawing a line from the development of Fortran to the end
of poetry as we know it is just too damn'd linear to be of use. On this
count, we'd also want to include for example - as Jonathan Skinner has
pointed out - birdsong as heterogeneous line of development in Dickinson's
work. Kristen Gallagher would advise: think Oliver Messien. As I asserted
in an understated way in my previous message, technology is already inside
the human, if often in surprising forms.

Anyway, the point of these rambling paragraphs is that if we are really
going to embrace the promise of something like OULIPO, we will have to
allow for the disruption of even our most cherished assumptions; and if we
are going to engage with overtly heterogenous systems and mechanical
procedures, we ought to admit that the history of those proceedings is
larger than it first looks.

--

Incidentally, Klingon - despite being a "synthetic" language - has a
non/native poetic tradition; see for example, Klingon Poetry
<http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Coffeehouse/3556/bhagwanklngn.htm>. With
this fact in mind, at a superficial level we might liken translating
"Translating Apollinaire" into Klingon to the bizarre and admirable
"Klingon Shakespeare Restoration Project"
<http://www.kli.org/stuff/Hamlet.html>: a diversification of available
resources that will no doubt have a deforming impact on the development of
the Klingon tongue. I wonder if DWH's poem has made a blip on the radar?

Hmmm. I'd love to see an "updated" version of Bottom: On Shakespeare, but
apparently we're still waiting for the Klingon Zukofsky.

Hi, listees,

i'm moving and wanna sell my "corrugated love pome 10: please send me a box
of tissues." it's gotta custom frame too  so it's ready for hanging.

 if you are an nyc person and buy now, you can get your choice of cheap
furniture for free (if you can drive it away): a futon with frame, a small
desk, a standing lamp.

would like a couple hundred cuz that's what it cost to frame but will
negotiate/trade.

p.s. i think i have a tape recording of a sample reading of it  to go with,
gotta dig around and see.

please backchannel through apr. 15 tax time  or phone at 718-832-2666.

A year or so ago, Tinfish Press came into over a hundred foil envelopes =

vegetarian, to write a small book to fit these envelopes.  I'm pleased =
to announce that the book is available, as of tomorrow, for a mere $5 =
from Tinfish, 47-728 Hui Kelu Street #9, Kaneohe, HI 96744.  The design =
is by Anne Sakutori, and it's well worth the drive through!=20

Want fries with that?  Tinfish Press has lots more poem food, including =
books by Bill Luoma, Lisa Kanae, Lisa Asagi and Gaye Chan, and _Tinfish_ =
11, which features a different work of art AS every cover (for a mere =
$8).  In the near future, Tinfish Press will be publishing work by =
Murray Edmond of New Zealand, Sawako Nakayasu of Japan/CA/Providence, =
and Lee Tonouchi of Aiea, Hawai`i.  Keep your ears peeled!!

Yes. Isn't it that in poetry language is obsessive, eroticized, fetishized
beyond its social "use"?

Yes again. The phrase "dissipate words into function" uncovers the
anti-poetry, the complete blindness to what poetry is (or should be) of
Wittgenstein's view of language. What more withering crticisim of the
assumptions behind "Philosophical Investigations" than this phrase:
"dissipate words into function."

Maybe the problem is simply one of semantics.  But how does a sensation (an
obsession, erotic moment, fetish) make itself known to us without signs, as
signs?  Do they not necessarily involve signification?  Can anyone come up
with an example of art that bypasses signs?  Best, Bill

Partly, signification may be assigned by the reader, the public. No art
bypasses signs because nothing is regarded as art unless picked and
rationalized as such by the public. Your question is circular, true only
apriori, when "art" is regarded as a word (in terms of usage). But what if
art is taken as a "thereness," vision. This is similar to the question, does
a sound, a tree in the forest exist if no one's there to see or hear it. The
empiricist says no, the idealist says yes. I for one believe the impetus for
art starts outside language and words constitute one of the media through
which it finds body. Partly that's why, I believe, poetry benefits greatly
through cross fertilization with other media (outside the close system or
outside the "modes of intention (Benjamin)" of words in any language, their
usage). Translation is that process of crossfertilization "outside usage."

Allen DeLoach was a solid worker in the proverbial vineyard, a great
survivor, a great heart. For years at UB he was the primary
tape-recorder(er) of readings and other action -- much like his New York
elder, the poet Paul Blackburn, had been. DeLoach's journal INTREPID
(1964-1972?) brought writers as various as Walter Lowenfels and Diane
DiPrima to the common reader of the time and his anthology, A Decade & Then
Some, collecting the active writers of the Lower East Side whom he had
published, became a landmark for the era he shared with such abiding
scribes as Ed Sanders, Gregory Corso, William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg.
The British critic Eric Mottram was also a close friend until his death. As
and when the literary annals of Buffalo for the past 50s years are writ,
Allen DeLoach will be a primary reference for the work that got done,
including very much his own. Salve, most generous old friend!

***
DELOACH - Allen W., social worker, writer

[Buffalo News 4/6/2002]

Allen W. DeLoach, a social worker, educator, writer, editor and filmmaker,
died Thursday (April 4, 2002) in his Kenmore home after a lengthy illness.
He was 62. An employment counselor for 17 years for the Erie County
Department of Social Services, he retired in 1997 because of failing
health. A 1971 graduate of the University at Buffalo, DeLoach also was a
member of the founding faculty of Empire State College and served as an
assistant professor at the college for several years. In addition, he was a
tireless promoter of local arts and writing organizations, including the
Niagara-Erie Writers and the Artists Gallery of Western New York, which he
served as a director. In the 1950s and early 1960s, DeLoach lived on the
Lower East Side of New York City, where he associated with hundreds of
writers and poets, including Allen Ginsberg. He later remembered many of
them in a book titled "The East Side Scene." During that period, he helped
usher in the beat movement in poetry and literature. As a writer, editor
and publisher, he published about 40 books of poetry, prose, journals,
anthologies and photographs. Born in Jacksonville, Fla., DeLoach completed
pre-engineering studies at the University of Florida, Gainesville. He
served in the Marine Corps and later in the Marine Corps Reserves. He left
Jacksonville in 1959 and, with $2 in his pocket, hitchhiked to New York
City to become a writer. He is survived by his wife, the former Janet
Burden; two sons, Allen and Karsten, both of San Francisco; a brother,
Robert of Macon, Ga.; a sister, Patricia Young of Alabama; eight
stepchildren; and 17 stepgrandchildren. Funeral services will be held at 10
a.m. Monday in Greco Funeral Home, 2909 Elmwood Ave., Kenmore.

Well, yes and no.  I don't think of either of my questions as circular, or
involving a priori matter, unless their rhetorical thrust may be classified
that way.  Of course I agree.  No communication of any sort escapes
signification.  That would be a contradiction in terms.  However, I suspect
an assumption in your comments above with which I might not agree.  You
suggest that poetry benefits from cross fertilization with "other" media
because the impetus for poetry lies outside language (you identify this as a
matter of faith -- "I believe").  The suggestion, if I'm reading you
correctly, is that such interaction permits poetry to connect on some level
with that impetus present in other media.  Either that, or poetry and other
media both find their sources in "thereness," (being?), in vision.  But that
common source is most assuredly language itself.  Whatever media we access,
it generates meaning for us only insofar as it is underwritten by language.
Music, for example, may soothe the savage beast.  But as soon as we
conceptualize it as music, it is language bound.  Since we are language
bound, there is no way for us to cross the line to determine whether your
faith is justified, whether it finds its fulfillment in a source beyond
language.  I have no doubt that the animal, the organic, the beyond or below
human leaks into language and is simultaneously
transformed/conceptualized/mediated.  But treating it as a source is another
matter altogether.  That's a "faith," an idea possible only within language.

As for Berkeley's tree, the empiricist is likely correct, knowing what we do
about sound waves, the ear drum, the interpretive/coordinating functions of
mind.  Still, it is necessary for us not to be there in order to know if
there is any there there.  Fat chance.  So we're stuck.  Best, Bill

Arno Schmidt
Translated from the German by John E Woods
Green Integer ($16.95)

From Rain Taxi
by Steven Moore

For those who have been following Arno Schmidt's erratic appearances in
English translation over the last 20 years, the publication  of The School
for Atheists is cause for celebration. This is one of the "hyper-books"
Schmidt wrote during his last decade, an oversized volume with elaborate
page layouts, illustrations, and Schmidt's unique, highly expressive style
of punctuation. At 301 pages it's no novella, but it does resemble a play
and is definitely a comedy.
     First published in 1972, The School is set mostly in the year 2014,
with an extended flashback to the summer of 1969, when a band of atheists
had their lack of faith tested (a clever reversal of the tradition
test-of-faith topos). The action takes place in a "reservation" in northern
Germany at a time when two superpowers rule the globe: a matriarchal United
States and a patriarchal China, representatives from which converge on the
reservation for a summit. At the center of the novel is a typical Schmidt
protagonist, a 75-year-old justice of the peace named Kolderup, who shares
Schmidt's own fantastic erudition and iconoclastic views. Living with him
are two "arsch damsels of Seven=Teen," his daughter Suse and her friend
Nipperchen, whose romantic escapades provide most of the comedy in this sex
farce.
     Schmidt was one of the few writers who valiantly attempted to pick up
where Joyce left off, using Finnegans Wake as a model for his own punning,
multilingual, polymorphously perverse prose. It takes some getting used
to--be prepared to spend about ten minutes on the first page--but once you
acclimatize yourself to it, Schmidt's prose is a delightful concoction (or
"cunt=cock=shun," as Schmidt would say) of double entendres, learned
allusions, and phonetically rendered speech, all heroically translated by
the fantastic John E. Woods. Though not as difficult as Finnegans Wake, the
novel likewise tosses many languages into a word salad, using etymologies
and puns to explore hidden connections and tensions (often sexual) between
signifiers and their signifieds.
     Like Robert Musil, Schmidt is a German writer of the first rank whose
tardy appearance in English translation has kept him from being as well
known in America as his countrymen Mann, Grass, Boll, and others. But enough
Schmidt is now available that readers who consider themselves au courant
with innovative, experimental fiction have no excuse for not knowing this
literary giant. The School for Atheists is a good place to start.   [Rain
Taxi, VII, 1 (Spring 2002), page 10]

Green Integer also publishes Schmidt's Radio Dialogs 1 ($12.95).

it must be the peculiar condition of the present moment that within a
few days of our venerable listowner posting in to (among other
things) cite delanda's "human artisans playing the role of
historically necessary 'channelers' for the machinic phylum's
'creativity'" (an intriguing thought, to be sure, if prematurely
apocalyptic), i am treated to the following:

(1) -- a fluff (?) segment on the abc weekend news lauding the
popularity of spoken word poetries and the youth culture that
supports same... to paraphrase promoter russell simmons, 'it all
started with rap,' with the suggestion (at least) that these
poetries, in addition to giving literal voice to urgent social
issues, can be widely marketed, can actually make money---presumably,
unlike other poetries...

(2) -- an editorial in ~the new york times magazine~ by one toby
cecchini, "writers of the world recite," that cops an attitude
against poetry readings in general ("But the fact is that most of us
-- on both sides of the podium -- hate readings") but serves also as
a thinly-veiled assault on all variants of item (1) (cf. "Why dash
the calming beauty of a collection of poetry that propped you up
through a rough patch by witnessing its author, when not forgetting
entire stanzas, braying it out in an annoyingly agressive 'Beat'
style?")... this column flanks a fashion insert entitled, quite
accurately, "MEN of Letters" (my uppercase), courtesy of which the
literati can be ogled at one's liesure striking suitably literary
poses, regaled in haute couture (no, i am not joking)...

(3) -- word from stephen king, somewhat contrary to his prior public
statement, that he will in fact *not* stop writing in the fall, after
all... that is, that he will only stop *publishing*---and that, in
the future, anything he writes that he wishes to publish will be
published *by him* (recall his online venture of a coupla years
back)...

(4) -- word from oprah winfrey that she can't find books that she's
"really passionate about," ergo that she's ending her book club as a
regular feature (the fact that oprah's ratings *have* dropped
considerably during her book club spots "doesn't matter," according
to her producer... and in any case, oprah *will* continue to endorse
books, as she sees fit)...

(5) -- and finally -- this is all within a few days, mind you, and i
had to check with my partner to be sure that my asthma meds weren't
inducing a mild form of hysteria -- i read in ~the ny times~ that
charles frazier (of ~cold mountain~ fame) has signed a deal worth a
total of $9.5 million (more or less) for a book that, to date,
consists of a 1-page outline...

now i don't purport to be able to resolve with any expediency the
disparities (anomalies?) attendant to these roughly simultaneous,
uhm, happenings... but i do believe that for writers or artists of
whatever persuasion to regard (1) through (5) in mutually exclusive
terms might constitute something of a, well, a miscalculation...

best,

I saw the same sad news this weekend...was
particularly alarmed by the NYT Magazine spread, which
was really just an excuse for a fashion spread.  They
wrote that of course the writers hated being dressed
up in fancy clothes--ahem!  If they had called me, I
would have been *delighted* to take free Prada
clothing to appear in their spread!  More importantly,
was appalled by the same quote that Joe quoted: "most
writers hate giving readings or being at readings."
In what realm is this true?  I love reading, and I
love going to readings.

In po-biz moments like these, I find it best to follow
the model of friend and teacher Malena Morling, who
writes with not a care in the world about
publishing...she just refocuses on her work and her
life, because that, of course, is where the real
pleaure lies.

For what it's worth, we might note that most of the writers pictured in =
the NYT fashion spread were NOT poets. It seems to me that the business =
of po-biz still isn't, and may never be, money.

Israel Committing An Ongoing Massacre in Jenin
Thirty-Three Palestinians Murdered in Less than Twelve Hours

6 April 2002
Palestine Media Center - PMC
http://www.palestine-pmc.com

The Palestine Red Crescent Society confirmed today that Israeli
occupation
forces have killed at least thirty Palestinian civilians in Jenin's
refugee
camp today. Eyewitnesses inside the camp confirm that Israeli bulldozers
have leveled the refugee camp's front row homes while the families were
still inside.

While the confirmed thirty victims were killed in one of the camp's
street,
the total number of casualties in the camp is estimated to be at least
100.
Many victims are buried under the rubble while scores others have been
torn
to pieces by the exploding tank shells; dozens others have bled to death
inside their homes and in front of their traumatized family members.

Six Palestinians were confirmed killed in the camp during the early hours
of
the morning and identified. The rest of the victims remain unidentified
while the number of injuries has been impossible to confirm, but is
feared
to be in the hundreds.

Since the early hours of the morning, Israeli Apache helicopters and
tanks
have been bombarding the densely populated refugee camp, where at least
150,00 people reside in an area that barely reaches 1 square kilometer.
In
fact, for the first time in its history of aggression, Israeli F-16
fighter
jets have bombarded the Jenin refugee camp, in an offensive clearly meant
to
exact the maximum number of civilian casualties.

Official sources estimate that in the past two days, the Jenin refugee
camp
has been bombarded with more missiles and tank shells than all those
Israeli
occupation forces have used against Palestinian targets in the past year
and
a half.

Israeli occupation forces continue to adamantly refuse to allow any
ambulance from reaching the refugee camp, even to collect the bodies. Two
days ago, Israeli bulldozers destroyed a make-shift mass grave that the
camp
's residents had made to bury their loved ones during the last Israeli
invasion in February. The horrific scene resulting from the destruction
was
that of bodies removed from their graves and strewn across the street.
Eyewitness accounts also confirm that Israeli tanks patrolling the street
have crushed a number of bodies that medical crews have been unable to
collect.

In a telephone interview with Al-Jazeera television, Umm Jihad, a camp
resident, described the desperate situation; "The shelling has not
stopped.
We are all cornered in our homes, unable to sleep, move, or help those
who
are pleading for help as they bleed in the camp's streets. The Israeli
bulldozers are leveling homes over their residents' heads and without a
prior warning. When we called health officials to ask for help, we were
informed that the occupation soldiers confiscated the ambulances' keys in
order to debilitate them. Our situation is one of indescribable suffering
and desperation for no one is intervening to save our children, who are
dying in front of our own helpless eyes".

In an unprecedented breach of human rights, Israeli occupation soldiers
announced in the afternoon that they would cease their fire in order to
allow the women and elderly to get water only to arrest them and use them
as
human shields later on. Since the residents have had no water for days, a
number of women and elderly men came out of their homes. However, as they
reached the camp's entrance, where Israeli tanks and personnel carriers
are,
they were all detained. Shortly after that, residents reported hearing
the
Israeli forces calling out on the microphone to the resistance fighters
and
security officers to surrender in order to save the lives of the detained
civilians. The detainees were seen strapped to the tanks and personnel
carriers, which resumed their bombardment campaign shortly after that
call
for surrender.. Strikingly, the Israeli officer previously heading the
Jenin
reoccupation offensive was reprimanded and removed from his duty after
having failed to take over the camp in the past four days. Currently,
Shaul
Mofaz, Israel's Chief of Staff, heads the brutal operation personally.
Palestinian officials have thus held him directly responsible for the
atrocities taking place in the Jenin refugee camp.

Jenin's three humble hospitals have confirmed that since today, they have
run out of fuel, needed to keep the electricity generators running after
Israeli occupation forces plunged the city into total darkness four days
ago. The hospitals have also run out of water.

As always, times of war and unbounded devastation bring about the most
extraordinary acts of courage and ingenuity. Reports from Jenin's Al-Razi
Hospital confirm that a doctor was successful in conducting life saving
brain surgery to Burhan Samir Burhan, who was critically injured in the
head. Surprisingly, the doctor, who was not specialized in such
complicated
surgeries, concluded the operation successfully through the help of a
specialized doctor in Ramallah's Public Hospital, who was on the phone
with
him throughout the operation!

Since yesterday, the Palestinian leadership has warned repeatedly,
through
numerous appeals, of a possible second Sabra and Shatila massacre, only
this
time it would be in Jenin. "The Palestinian leadership urgently appeals
to
the international community and the Arab leaders to immediately intervene
and help save the residents of the Jenin refugee camp for they have been
the
victims of a brutal war campaign, lead personally by Israel's Chief of
Staff, Shaul Mofaz", read a leadership statement. It added, "We hold the
international community responsible for delaying any intervention that
could
spare the refugee camp's residents from a sure massacre".

So far, no international party has intervened to stop the ongoing
massacre.

TICKETS: ADV $13.00; DOS $15.00
DJ Spooky , Amiri Baraka , Carl Hancock Rux
Bear witness as the old master meets the heir apparent, as the cauldron
is stirred by the beat mixologist of his generation. Amiri Baraka rose
to prominence as radical poet and playwright Leroi Jones, publishing
controversial texts in the 60s that proved prophetic. Among his many
accolades, he is the winner of the PEN/Faulker Award, and the founder of
Totem Press in 1958, which first published works by Allen Ginsberg and
Jack Kerouac. Carl Hancock Rux was named by The New York Times to be
"one of 30 artists under 30 most likely to influence culture in the next
30 years." It states, "A poet, novelist, secular preacher, and hip-hop
provocateur, Carl Hancock Rux always thrills with his incendiary shows."
Their collaborator for the evening, DJ Spooky aka That Subliminal Kid,
bridges the gap between downtown experimentalism and hip-hop culture.

Michael Gottlieb and Jordan Davis Reading in NYC


 Michael Gottlieb and Jordan Davis  will be reading at Double Happiness
this Saturday April 13, 4:15 pm.  April 13.  Jordan Davis is an editor of
The Hat, a frequent contributor to the Poetry Project Newsletter, and the
author of a dozen chapbooks, most recently _Yeah, No_ (Detour) and _A
Winter Magazine_ (Situations). The Segue series at Double Happiness has
long been Michael Gottlieb's favorite series.  Although now that the
bartender seems to know what he is going to order before he opens his
mouth, he's not so sure. The author of ten books including recently,
_Gorgeous Plunge_ from Roof Books, his newest title, _Careering Obloquy_,
is due out from Other Publications this spring.  Double Happiness  is
located at 173 Mott St., just south of Broome.

-----------------
Kenning "newsletter" is proposing a column to appear in its final issue, to

tentatively entitled:  "Why Hate Literature?" or "Criticism and
Public-ation" -

focus) include:  the differences between criticism as writing practice and
criticism as a genre - the public role of the literary critic - the archive
vs. hoarding - critical paranoia - when does reading end and criticism
begin? - the possible existence of uncritical reading, or pre-critical
writing - the "pre-critical" per se - criticism in verse - reading against
critics / criticism - writing against writing - literary self-hatred - etc
etc

Submissions should be no longer than 200 words, preferably a single
paragraph / stanza / bibliography.  Send hard copy submissions (preferred)
to the editorial address below, including a SASE and brief cover letter (no
bio's please).  Electronic submissions should come to
kenningpoetics@hotmail.com and should be in the body of the email message -
no attachments will be read.  Deadline for submissions to this column is
May 15th, sharp.

Symposium: Globalism After Genoa

Saturday, 13 April 2002 / 5PM

panel includes:
Joel Sternfeld, moderator
Stefania Galante, Ph.D., arrested at the Genoa Social Forum
Alexander Stille, journalist
Kevin Danaher, founder "Global Exchange"

In conjunction with Joel Sternfeld's exhibition
Treading on Kings: Protesting the G8 in Genoa
(through 27 April 2002 at WHITE BOX)
    The 26th Summit Meeting  of the  G8, the informal discussion club
of the leaders of the world's most industrialized nations which took
place in Genoa, Italy in the summer of 2001 left hundreds of protestors
arrested, 600 or more injured and one person dead.
    In an attempt to document this historic event in a manner that would

equal voice to those who took to the streets, the artist /photographer
Joel Sternfeld made portraits of demonstrators and recorded their
responses to an essential question; why have you come to Genoa?
     These portraits with text and other related images: President Bush
arriving at the Ducale Palace, blood on the floor of an elementary
school
being used as a dormitory after a midnight police raid, and a picture of

a funerary box holding the cremated remains of Carlo Giuliani are
intended to form a basis for discussion of the events in Genoa - and of
the attendant issues of globalization.

Murat. Thanks for this response.  I'm not sure if art is  a "mirror of its
time" .. I suppose it has to be, as you say, indirectly. I think we are in a
time where the avant garde or whoever you call them  the "post-modernists"
or the Langpos or whoever are pushing the limits are responding to what is
happenning (I mean what has happennned in the last 500 years up to the
present day, the NOW) and in particular the last two centuries are highly
significant in that quantitative to qualitative "leaps" have occurred: and
we all know about developments in music, art, mathematics, democracy, the
women's and the civil rights struggles, mass production, the effect of
vasrious catastrophic wars, and so on. Its problematic that a poet should be
writing after S11 or "while Israel-Palestine"  but I am or am not writing
not directly because of those things: they dont have a very direct effect on
my thinking (I mean my poetic thinking such as it is just now): my own
personal life may have more ...my physical health, what I'm coincindently
reading, or something I over hear...."history" is important but its very
background for me: no tanks or bulldozers roar across New Zealand and even
if they ever did I couldnt write poetry "about" them. I tried eg to write a
poem about Alan Curnow but it was just "cleverness". Now when I write
"without thinking" and JUST WRITE, I like what I do and I have some people
here who also like it but eg I dont think that the people in Brief  (Wystan
Curnow, Leggott, Radich etal  are interested) partly because as a local
(published and in held rather high esteem) poet Tony Beyer, who DOES admire
my poetry, commented : "Its a closed shop..." and he further commented that
post-modernism can lead to fascism: but this was a brief exchange...but I
dont think that what has been acheived by them (whoever the postmodernists
etc are) either leads to or away from fascism or whatever...the point of
this is that a poet whom (stylistically) I disagree with (yet I know he is
greatly talented) "likes" what I do... now what I do rarely reflects the
environment per se: although I had a few poems that were inspired by seeing
Oliver Sachs ) of "The Man who Mistook His Wife fir a Hat") now what
fascinated me about that was Sachs himself: and the way he dealt with the
various people and their syndromes, his fascination with a certain
experience of a colour and so on: now THAT can energise me, and also infact
the WAY he said what he said, his vibrant personality -he's a kind of genius
of being a person ...but some theoretical discussion about language will
largely leave me cold. I say largely because obviously I am interested in
that discussion: in particular I am intereted in Charles Bernstein's
essays...and indirectly such essays and critical works have an importance.

>> Basically, yes, has not much to do with the writing except that if one is
received well and or has a publisher, this may stimulate gretaer efforts:
but a writer "should" I feel be tring to create something whose usefulness
is for him/herself inits process as you point out. The concept of real
process interests me: not "finished" or "perfect" poems as such. Be a doer
not a critic! In other words. Thus in a way, with process, one looks a back
toward realism however that can be defined: the "realism"...this realism
becoming rapidly surealism. We are strange, beating things.

>>No. If they even think too much about what or why they are doing what they
are doing no work (if work it is) would get done. The question "What use is
it?" would probably be quite puzzling: its probably just fortuitous that
science has a use for big business. Most scientists (and in another way)
most writers are not primarily concerned about reception or payment: just as
very few of us make love to produce children.

The same way, a poem can not be

> good, is it innovative, is it daring, is it relevant." A poet, I believe,

>
>>I agree: for better or worse we are indivviduals even if we get into a
more "socialistic" society or whatever (which will never be a Utopia as
Robert Hughes naively postulates thinkers always wanted: surely people
realise taht with whatever social structure we have we still have the human
struggle! Robert Hughes is clever but basicaly a simplifier: because he is
right wing and fundamentally anti-progress.)

>>You could be right: Newton always knew that the concept of a single point
or cntre in space was theoretical and ignored it: Einstein similarly
invented the "Cosmic constant" to enable the Universe to be infinite intime:
that is he rejected the "Big Bang" theory which paradoixically was
"invented" (well one of its proponents was) a priest...Actually Jack Ross
weaves Kepler and so on into his strange poem/novel which I reveiwed for
Brief. Its called "Nights with Giodorno Bruno" I think he is now the new
editor of Brief (I can give the email number if you are interested)

        Hi, Carl Dennis lives in Buffalo and teaches at UB. He writes
happy go lucky crap which looks and feels like poetry. I can't believe
its not poetry??? NO its very good main stream stuff. If he wasn't doing
his thing then we shouldn't be doing ours. So we are all very proud of
him in Buffalo.

As a truly magnificent poet (and infallible critic) myself, I can vouch for
this.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

POETRY AS SOCIAL PRACTICE: TIPS AND SLOGANS


All poetry is easily classifiable into the categories of innovative and
non-innovative. Digital poetry is innovative.

The cultural status quo lies in the act of not engaging the materiality of
the medium of writing. Culture is now progressing through innovation.

There are serious benefits to reading digital text as a material mode of
making shaped by institutional and ideological concerns. Electronic
literature must have a canon now!

It is important to engage in practice that provides a critique of the
cultural status quo and of our ways of reading as an apparatus of that
status quo. The point of poetry is to create a poetry that is a material
ideological practice.

Digital poetry is engaged in material struggle. It is innovative. It shows
that the most important part of poetry is the materiality of the medium.

The reader will be your sidekick if you ignore her and engage the
materiality of the medium of writing. Innovative poetry asks, ^ÓWon^Òt you be
my co-author?^Ô

Computers are perfect machines. They will solve the problem of the ^ÓI^Ô if we
let them.

All hail the episteme of the Intel processor! All sensuality to the machine!
All eroticism to the keyboard!

Integrate into the data stream. Don^Òt touch the hard drive.

There is a war going on between print and digital textualities. Whose side
are you on? Print is static and the digital medium fluid. Don^Òt be static,
be fluid.

The typewriter has taken you hostage. If you use a typewriter, you^Òre a
has-been.

Digital poetry hacks into the mainstream of the cultural status quo,
reworking the operating system of our ideological habits. For instance, the
digital poet gives the author function a pink slip. Goodbye author function,
hello writing machine.

....

DIA[L-A]-LOG(IC)

Writing machine: ^ÓHi.^Ô

Digital poet: ^ÓHi, writing machine! Let^Òs get naked and engage the
materiality of your medium.^Ô

Writing machine: ^ÓHi.^Ô

Digital poet (clearing throat): ^ÓUh, I said, ^ÑLet^Òs get naked.^Ò Don^Òt you
understand commands? You^Òre a computer!^Ô

Writing machine: ^ÓWha?^Ô

Digital poet (throwing arms into the air): ^ÓOh, at last! It^Òs alive. You
have spoken. Now give me the ten digital commandments and I^Òll be spoken
too. I^Òll be Moses and your microchips will be my tablets.^Ô

Writing machine: ^ÓWha?^Ô

Digital poet (whispering): ^ÓI^Òve got some algorithms in my car. I thought we
could, you know, go back to my place and collaborate.^Ô

Writing machine: ^ÓHi.^Ô

Digital poet (pounding fists on desk): ^ÓLook, I don^Òt have all day. Show me
your indeterminacy or I^Òm logging off!^Ô

Writing machine: ^ÓError message: Page Expired.^Ô

Digital poet: ^ÓI love expired pages! Oh yeah, right there, such massive
pixels, run them through my silken hair.^Ô

....

If you do not engage the medium, you can^Òt be an innovative poet. You must
qualify the emphasis on the ^ÓI^Ô in the making of a poem or you can^Òt be part
of my innovative digital poet group, either.

The use of multiple ^ÓI^Ôs marks poetry as innovative. People who have dark
skin pigment are less than human.

I love poetry, books and language but I don^Òt love meaning. Meaning sucks.
It has the word ^Óme^Ô in it.

In our history of literary teleologies, narrative has no future.

One can never be outside society. Community is total. The informatics of
discourse shall replace community. All social problems will be solved
digitally. Polis is Pentium Pros.

Nature is immoral. It doesn^Òt even exist, which is the greatest immorality
of all. Don^Òt let it inspire you.

Attraction is pure construct. All marriages are arranged. Good feelings are
suspect.

Don^Òt follow your bliss; follow a reading list.

Sense perception is an illusion, so stop writing from your experience. Got
that, class?

We no longer have bodies; we have biounits. We no longer have words; we have
quotons. We no longer have cultures, we have institutions.

Technology, especially digital technology, is more innovative than
everything else, including chickens. Poems on the World Wide Web taste
better, more like chicken, than poems on paper (they taste like fish).

Everything exists to be on-line one day.

The World Wide Web is a polysemous, constantly changing multi-author text,
which is to say writing, a poetics. It is not an Irish-motherfucking-Spring
commercial with flowers coming out of our collective fudge tunnel.

Digital media is a plural, democratic space of poesis. The proper way to
spell poesis is poeioeisis.

In cyberspace there are no slums.

The point of neutralizing the ego is not to expand consciousness but to
engage the materiality of the medium of writing.

Mediation and ideology shall be the only subject matter of poetry from now
on. No more striving for the infinite. No more fighting for heaven.

Ambition equals arrogance. Introspection is solipsistic and regressive. To
be self-reflexive is to be self-absorbed.

Individualism is anti-social. To look within oneself is apolitical. Self
will be replaced by milieu.

We can only be sure of one thing: The truth is not attainable. All meaning
is commodified except the meaning of this statement.

Poetry shall be automated, by us. It no longer needs humanity except to
bring it into existence. Only language and code are needed.

Beauty shall have no seat in the pantheon of values. Beauty is dangerous in
its overpowering stimulation of the senses, in its satisfaction of a need
for harmony and delight. It is repulsive.

The only thing that shall be celebrated is critique. Invective is verboten.

Even though the poem-as-machine is a Modernist invention, digital poetry
based on machinic models is still innovative as hell.

Emotions are passe -- leftovers from the age of reptiles. The unconscious
and its disturbing contents will go away if we just let it. Hopefully,
history will go away too some day.

Emotions and shifts in tone prevent engagement with the medium. The day of
materiality is permanently at war with the night of emotion.

The visionary and the everyday shall not lie down in the same bunk bed.
Nature and culture shall not share the same dentist.

Love and rage shall not go out on dates. The poetry of Blake, Rimbaud,
Cesaire, Rukeyser, Vallejo and Artaud is too full of anger to be innovative.

Uplifting, consciousness-expanding poetry is immoral. Sly and the Family
Stone were a bunch of sincere losers thinking they could unite the races and
sexes with their music.

Idiolectic poetry will unite the races and sexes. In the classroom at least.

Avoid extreme sensations. Never be unpredictable. It weirds people out and
thus is bad for business. Change is counter-productive.

Don^Òt be crazy. Try to be non-normative instead.

Be miserable. It shows everyone that you care.

The poet^Òs place is in the medium exploring its materiality, making its
making. A woman^Òs place is in the kitchen making breakfast.

All writing and art is a power struggle for public space. Social stature is
what matters in the end.

If you decide to stop writing poetry say it was for economic reasons.

Mock sincerity sincerely. Deride the need to communicate and be heard
--they^Òre embarrassing. Overcome the need for self-expression but not the
need to rise in literary circles.

Poems about ^ÓI^Ôs in trouble tend to be less innovative than poems about ^ÓI^Ôs
who are just chilling.

Subvert the position of the monolinear ^ÓI^Ô but be sure to leave your
subjectivity intact. To achieve universality, hide your subjectivity and
deny the value of the self.

Don^Òt express your subjectivity in a poem (prose is okay). However, all
poems will be judged according to structures of race, class, gender and
sexuality.

Try not to write or talk about your parents, except in interviews.

By speaking for no one but for those who speak of it, the ideology of
co-authoring speaks for all.

Anomie is a form of utopia. Indulge in alienation. Take great pride in being
estranged. It proves you^Òre an intellectual and different than the masses.

Act like you understand critical theory -- that way people will respect you.
Try to hybridize your discourse by enlivening it with terms like
^Ócreolization.^Ô Using words like ^Óplural,^Ô ^Ómultivalent^Ô and ^Ópolysemous^Ô
shows how open-minded and widely learned you are.

When one writes innovative digital poetry one is subverting the economic,
social and psychological paradigms and regimes promoted and maintained by
conglomerates like Microsoft and Time Warner. One is resisting conventional
ways of thinking and feeling just like Gertrude Stein did.

The Modernist avant-garde adopted the techniques and rhythms of mechanical
reproduction in order to pave the way for their domination.

Use the technology but don^Òt question it. Unite with the technology and put
an end to the alienation you encounter in the world at large. We are the
servants of the computerized medium -- not the other way around.

If you do use the ^ÓI^Ô it can only refer to yourself, but quote Rimbaud^Òs ^ÓI
is an other^Ô ^Ö you know the drill ^Ö to throw the reader off guard.

The ^ÓI^Ô will always refer to the author (who is dead, not alive, but still
getting checks in the mail) so no one should use it except in certain
survival scenarios: ^ÓGive it up, I was a track star for Mineola Prep!^Ô

Be alienated but don^Òt be a victim. We live in a victim culture and too many
people are complaining. If you^Òre white, male or educated you needn^Òt whine
except about other people whining.

Slam poetry is a vulgar folk art but will serve as a useful category in
Performance Studies book.

Art that is purely formal will not result in a period style.

Those who write lyrical poetry are being sentimental. Those who look back on
the Modernist moment as the golden age of radical linguistic practice are
not.

The Language poets were not Romantic in their supposition that the
subversion of normative syntactical relations would undermine oppressive
social relations. The Language poets did not want to re-legislate the world.

A text of alternative textuality always makes a good innovative poem. The
notion of a text of alternative textuality making a good innovative poem is
an interesting and radical notion of what a poem is and could be.

Representation is phallocentric. The phallus cannot be represented (on TV).

Make up a name for a new kind of poetry and hold a conference on it. Presto,
you^Òre an expert.

Try to find words embedded in other words (an unexplored niche!)

Call your poetry ^Ócognitive music.^Ô If someone points out that it isn^Òt very
musical or rhythmic, call it ^Ónoise.^Ô

By creating a poetry analogous to Muzak or (background) noise one is
creating a poetry that motivates the reader to focus on every word.

Speak or write in an obdurate utopian discourse and when someone points out
how you ridiculous you sound, say you were being ironic.

Rail against the academy but complain when academics don^Òt invite you to
their conferences.

Interview all your poet-friends because you have little else to offer.

When a really good poet dies, immediately call for a conference to be held
on their work at the next MLA soiree. That way you can claim intellectual
spokesmanship for their corpus.

Collaborate to transcend your ego and then tell us all about it. Get rid of
the ego to call attention to yourself.

Meaning is a hindrance to the liberation of the sign^Òs materiality from its
division of labor in the signifying function. This is not a mystifying,
pseudo-materialist, technocratic notion of language but based on hard
historical evidence that certain forms of language are essentially
oppressive.

Quote yourself at the beginning of every chapter in your book on digital
poetry. By quoting two other people no one will notice.

Decry the use of personal experiences as subject matter for poetry by
calling them selfish ^Ólifestyle elements.^Ô Poems that refer to or describe
discrete events are anecdotal.

Non-innovative literature can be said to possess a number of distinguishing
textual features. These can include narrative, plot, anecdotal re-telling of
human experiences, logical descriptions, chronological sequences of events,
a reliance on factual information, a view of language as a transparent (or
at most, tinted) bearer of meaning, and an attachment to a Modernist
aesthetic. Such texts often base their authority on the foundation of the
certainty of semantic meaning.

An innovative text treats the making of meaning as problematic.

Endlessly theorize about a medium that is just getting started but don^Òt
criticize it that much (it^Òs just getting started!)

Say your poems are all about desire but never about the desire for a
particular person, animal, body part, sexual position/experience, affordable
housing, warm meal, etc.

How different is ginger ale when drinking from a crystal flute compared to a
styrofoam cup. These and other similar dynamics inform innovative practice.

Never define materialist practice, materialist poetics or
aesthetico-materialist critique. Let the reader make up the meaning.

The goal of digital poetry is a wealth of media and a poverty of expression.

Nobody believes in poetry enough to die for it anymore, which is a shame.
But avoid being too serious ^Ö that brooding, agonizing ^Ódark night of the
soul^Ô act will get you nowhere. Poetry^Òs just a game anyway.

Even though it is an accomplished fact, the Revolution of the Word must go
on.

:sloth, i can't wake up day after day, sleep half of it away, trying to
seize employment in the rest, we're leaving the end of the month, working
on the phenomenology of approach vis-a-vis the everglades, their
entanglement and working one's way through them into sensibility, my
sleeps are dreamless, the hospital did a follow-up phone-call, there were
three calls this morning, i don't remember, all about leaving, everything
about withdrawal, i imagine florida in diminution, the phenomenology of
withdrawal, from the known to the vector of the road, i continue writing,
imaging, taping, my arms leave me, i am heavy, redolent, fecund with the
smell of death ==::attacked in our sleep we will disappear, attacked in
our sleep, the sounds of night continue with the murmuring of plants and
animals everywhere in the world, the world is a giant hospital, the world
is a phone-call, a war, the world is redolent with pain and sleeping
animals, nothing disappearing, nothing emerging, the phenomenology of
quietude against incandescent horizons ==:last night we went back into the
thicket on another night-trip, pale white spiders, activities among the
glade-bugs, small cricket frog, of all two sleeping anoles on leaves,
their legs were stretched out, back against their small bodies, sluggish
and comfortable, almost nothing moving, some barking dogs, they're wild
elsewhere in the thicket, the weight of the thicket soft upon us,
elsewhere the violent and bloody war, o anoles sleep through it, o anoles
survive our dark incursion, o anoles humans shall leave this burned and
violated earth, o anoles sleep well, i will sleep with you, dying in my
sleep, attacked in our sleep == 'we are staying to guard this holy place,
but we are not being held against oted 'electronMessage 25 marked for ur
will' == monk in bethlehem == and fellowship

Moving Still
Poems by Leonard Brink

As the title suggests, Leonard Brink is a metaphysical poet. In his =
poems, word jostles thought, matter is a "category of ideas," the ghost =
is not in but is the machine. The poems move, still move, and are still.
--Keith Waldrop

This is a poetry that is steadfast at its core, while its surfaces, its =
"higher planes," so to speak, wander through time, space, and language. =
Up there, the density of these surfaces search out their own depths.
-- Elizabeth Robinson

Leonard Brink's poems bend seemingly linear lines of reflection into =
unique knots of tautology and reversal which think with, rather than =
against, contradiction.

Dear Goeffrey. Please define "crap"...I'm having dificulties: please no
witticisms about constipated mathematicians.  Do you know that one?  I
suspect Carl Dennis is in fact a genius. Regards, Richard.

***************************

APRIL 12, FRIDAY [10:30 pm]
BLACK TOOK: THE WILD READING
DAWN LUNDY MARTIN, DURIEL E. HARRIS, RONALDO V. WILSON AND R. ERICA DOYLE.
This linguistic interactive performance will foreground race and
racelessness, sex and sexuality, and other bodily perversities. All
attendees will receive free Coon Journals to record their
racialized/sexualized experiences.

APRIL 15, MONDAY [8:00 pm]
VERONICA CORPUZ AND RODRIGO TOSCANO
VERONICA CORPUZ is currently the Program Assistant at The Poetry Project and
editor of Poets & Poems, the Project's online journal. Forthcoming work will
appear in the next issues of Aufgabe and Shiny.

RODRIGO TOSCANO is the author of Partisans (O Books), The Disparities (Green
Integer), and Platform (Atelos, forthcoming). Fanny Howe writes: "Rodrigo's
poems have emerged as serious, serial shots at the dark..." He lives in NYC
where he works at the Labor Institute.

APRIL 17, WEDNESDAY [8:00 p.m.]
GEORGE ECONOMOU, ROCHELLE OWENS, AND KAZUKO SHIRAISHI
Translations for Shiraishi read by SAMUEL GROLMES and YUMIKO TSUMURA

GEORGE ECONOMOU has published 7 books of poetry, including Landed Natures
(Black Sparrow), Ameriki (Sun Press) and most recently, Century Dead Center
(Left Hand Books). The San Francisco Review of Books writes "Delicate and
fast, but holding, in the same way that the Greek lyrics hold, a moment of
telling that moment in song. It is the thing seen and felt that Economou
sings and tells and shares. This is what makes a fine lyric."

A pioneer in the experimental off-Broadway theatre movement, ROCHELLE OWENS
is the author of 16 books of poetry and plays and has received several
Village Voice Obie Awards and Honors from the NY Drama Critics Circle.
Marjorie Perloff writes on Owens: "In its uncompromising savagery, its
passionate rejection of sentimentality, its black humor, and its sheer
outrageousness, Rochelle Owens' lyric voice is unique among contemporary
poets."

KAZUKO SHIRAISHI's latest volume of translations, Let Those Who Appear,
contains selections from various recently-published books as translated by
Yumiko Tsumura and Samuel Grolmes. The title poem is from Shiraishi's 1996
book which received three prestigious awards in Japan--the Takami Jun Poetry
Award, the Yomiuri Literature Award, and the Purple Ribbon Medal from the
Emperor of Japan.

APRIL 19, FRIDAY [10:30 pm]

Probably does have something to do with it. There's Schutz, Bachelard,
Lefevre, for examples (spelling might be off here). Schutz developed
relevance theory; Bachelard works with space, corner, shell, sound, fire,
etc.; Lefevre has a work on phenomenology of space. This stuff also goes
back to Hall and Gibson in terms of personal space and perception. But
what I'm interested in is _approach_ which involves a dialectic between
partial structures, steering structures, etc., and an anomalous and
poorly-defined domain. How, out of this, does knowledge emerge? When one
walks in the Everglades at night, how does one orient oneself?

There's also the work in AI by the way - Schank and Abelson on scripts and
goals, etc.

Hi Richard,

I agree that he has genius and should be supported by the Pulitzer
committee and I am sincere in my pride of a local poet who made good. He
lives down the street from me so 'way to go!' At least its not that awful
Irving Feldman guy who won. But Dennis's poety comes from a stand point
of poet as dispenser of truth. I hate this component, as he comes from a
point of 'your confused life will be better if you listen to this poem.
His prize winning book is filled with it. I can't quote from it as I
didn't buy it, only read over coffee at the book shop. The poet is not
priest and shouldn't take that kind of position in my opinion, which crap
is an opinionated response to a full, complex body of work which I do not
appreciate and strive in my works to undo. A professor of mine says,
Dennis's poety will always be appreciated as long as there are world almanacs


Best, Geoffrey


PS -- I haven't heard the constipated mathematicians joke :-)

Two things:

1) We are please to announce the publication of

A Conversation with David Antin by David Antin and Charles Bernstein

$12.95 ISBN 1-887123-55-5 Paperback. 1/2" x 9" 128 pp.

A four-month interchange between the poet/essayist Charles Bernstein
and artist/poet/critic David Antin. Ideas on art, poetry, as well as
Antin's transition to site-specific talk performances are discussed.
The combination of the speed of electronic transmission and the
rigors of writing as opposed to talking make this book, in Antin's
words, "a cross between an 18th-and 21st-century text." A
Conversation with David Antin presents the entirety of this dialogue
between two of the most important figures on the contemporary poetry
scene.


2) We have produced a catalog of all of our trade publications (new,
forthcoming & recent) for the upcoming BEA [Book Expo America]
convention in NYC. It is available as a PDF file. Click here to
access the catalog: http://www.granarybooks.com/trade.html
NOTE: the text of the catalog is optimized for printing rather than
for the screen - for an optimal reading experience we advise printing
out the catalog.

textually homogenizing tendencies in Maxine Hong Kingston's work.

Subject:      Hello Matthew Garite
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Dear Matthew Garite,

Intrigued by your description of my post as an example of "the thermidor
response" I searched until I found a nice condensed definition of the word
thermidor. I assume that you did not mean a bass technique or lobster dish.


thûr´mdôr, Fr. trmdôr´) (KEY) , 11th month of the French Revolutionary
calendar. The coup of 9 Thermidor (July 27, 1794) marked the downfall of
Robespierre and the end of the Reign of Terror. The men who came into power
were members of the old bourgeoisie and the newly rich who had profited from
speculation and inflation. Extravagance in dress and manner prevailed. The
Jacobins were suppressed, but the royalists did not gain power. The
Thermidorians removed economic controls, thus unleashing inflation, and
established some freedom of worship. The principal figures in the so-called
Thermidorian reaction included Barras and Tallien. The period ended with the
establishment of the Directory (1795).
See A. Mathiez, The Thermidorian Reaction (1929, tr. 1930).

--- Columbia Encyclopedia


So I need a little help here. What specifically in the "Poetry as Social
Practice" post strikes you as Thermidorian? What association are you making
between certain kinds of poetry or, rather, certain arguments for a certain
kind of poetry, with class struggle? Is "digital poetry" a revolution and
the criticism of its poetics/ideology a counter-revolution? What class does
digital poetry, in its current usage, speak for/represent? Like I said I
need help.

Thanks,
Dave

P.S.: Lately I've been dressing pretty casual.

No I am not hiding behind the name "Matthew Garite" if that is what you are

Greetings Dave,

Thank you for the attentiveness of your reply. As noted, my use of the word
"thermidor" was not an attempt to describe your post as a bass technique or
lobster dish. Nor did I mean to accuse you of extravagance in dress or
manner. "Thermidor" was instead being used here to describe what I would
consider "reactionary" tendencies exemplified by your exaggerated, ironic
characterization of certain strains of critical theory. Let me first state
that for the most part I enjoyed the humor of your "Poetry as Social
Practice" post. Certain lines were quite funny. My description of your post
as a kind of "Thermidor response" was not so much intended as a critique of
your position regarding digital poetries (I have little to no stake in such
a debate), but rather a defense of what I would deem "strategically useful
theoretical gestures." In a poetic economy (which continues to be) dominated
by confessional, "I"-centered modes of discourse, there is something to be
said for the oppositionality of a writing (digital or not) that mobilizes
behind "tips" or "slogans" like "Goodbye author function, hello writing
machine." I agree with you that this is certainly not an "innovative"
gesture, nor was it particularly innovative when practiced at various points
throughout the 20th century. I'm not attempting to rally behind "the new,"
here. But I do consider these practices valuable when considered as part of
a larger (particularly Marxist) project to overcome the exploitations and
objectifications which arise from capitalist modes of production. Capitalism
has a love affair with entrepreneurial, DIY subjective agents. There is a
certain subversive potential (however limited) to writing which reduces the
"authoring" subject to a machine, an alienated, non-expressive object of
ideology. Over the past thirty years or so, this sort of writing has gained
a certain amount of (nevertheless marginal) institutional presence and power
at places like UB, etc. I'm sure you're familiar with all of this. But what
your post seems to constitute, then, is a conservative reaction to this
presence--a Thermidor response to the newly-acquired institutional authority
of de-centered modes of poetic discourse, as well as the poetics / ideology
(i.e. the "tips" and "slogans") through which such authority speaks. Your
ironic critique, enacted through the distance of (exaggerated,
oversimplified) statements like "Sense perception is an illusion, so stop
writing from your experience. Got that, class?" or "Mediation and ideology
shall be the only subject matter of poetry from now on. No more striving for
the infinite. No more fighting for heaven," seems to signify a desire to
return to an unquestioned poetics of experience--one whose "striving for the
infinite" isn't hampered by ideological concerns. Your irony is almost
always reliant upon a simple reversal of exaggerated binaries, a tendency to
implicitly stand behind the opposite of what is really meant. By arranging
each of your "slogans" in a context which deems them ridiculous, you end up
privileging the exact opposite of whatever they say. In other words, by
ironizing a statement like "Don't be crazy," you end up advocating a
statement like "Be crazy." Your ironizing of de-centered writing is arrived
at only by advocating a return to an "I"-centered, emotional, sincere,
expressive writing. Or that, at least, is the point I'm making by
associating your "Poetry as Social Practice" post with the
"counter-revolutionary" implications of a phrase like "Thermidor response."
Like I said, I enjoyed certain parts of the post, but just don't see the
(critical, political) value of mocking or ironizing what little
institutional power has currently been achieved by a critical theory of (not
just digital) poetics, especially when such irony seems intent upon
returning to a writing practice which privileges counter-productive
"subjects" like emotion, sincerity, I's in trouble, relations with parents,
et cetera. Anyway, hope that clears things up a bit. Let me know what you
think.

Thanks,
Matt

Is being called Tralfamadorean like being called sectarian? When I was in
the ISO I was called sectarian for disagreeing with some fellow ISO members
(not for wanting to start a sect).

So, what is Tralfamadorean? Please explain these terms so people don't have
to go searching.

Thanks,
Dave

(Thank you Matt Garite. I will respond to your post soon.)

I also have a question.
"In other words, by ironizing a statement like "Don't be crazy..." Does
"ironizing" have anything to do with dirty laundry?

"Thermidor" sounds like the word of a bully to me, a kind of name calling.

Subject:      Response to Matt
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Dear Matt,

Thank you for a very articulate response to my questions. I^Òm afraid some of
the ^Óexaggerations,^Ô as you call them, that are presented in ^ÓPoetry as
Social Practice,^Ô aren^Òt very far from the actual arguments that I^Òve come
across in my reading of ^Óde-centered writing^Ô and ^Óinnovative practice^Ô^Òs
contemporary supporters.  The following quotation that come towards the end
can be found word-for-word in Loss Pequeno Glazier^Òs new book ^ÓDigital
Poetics: The Making of E-Poetries^Ô:

^ÓNon-innovative literature can be said to possess a number of distinguishing
textual features. These can include narrative, plot, anecdotal re-telling of
human experiences, logical descriptions, chronological sequences of events,
a reliance on factual information, a view of language as a transparent (or
at most, tinted) bearer of meaning, and an attachment to a Modernist
aesthetic. Such texts often base their authority on the foundation of the
certainty of semantic meaning.

An innovative text treats the making of meaning as problematic.^Ô

I can^Òt help but think Mr. Glazier is not paying much attention to the
meaning he makes, the language he uses, a form of discourse he undoubtedly
did not invent himself but learned and adopted in our institutions of higher
learning. (Isn't more important how these elements -- "factual information,"
narrative, etc -- are used and not whether or not they are used?) Near the
end of his book, Glazier writes that ^Óit is not necessarily culturally
productive to fell things, traditions or forests for profit or other
reasons.^Ô Ignoring for a second the unstated meaning of ^Ñculturally
productive^Ò and the standard diplomatic ^Ñnot necessarily^Ò (I wonder what his
criteria for felling things is ^Ö for me it^Òs lies), I find the reduction of
culture (whether poetry or something else) to certain traits ^Ö or a bunch of
material or ideology ^Ö to be not unlike the reduction of people to certain
traits or material to be exploited for purely economic or ^Ñculturally
productive^Ò reasons. Hence the sequence ^ÓThe use of multiple ^ÓI^Ôs marks
poetry as innovative. People who have dark skin pigment are less than human^Ô
in my post. Hence, again, the sequence ^ÓNature is immoral. It doesn^Òt even
exist, which is the greatest immorality of all. Don^Òt let it inspire you^Ô --
a detournement of Juliana Spahr^Òs comment ^ÓNature poetry is immoral^Ô --
quoted in the most recent Poetry Project Newsletter. Like Jesse Helms
finding a Mapplethorpe photo disgusting because he finds the subject matter
disgusting, I think Spahr^Òs dismissal of Nature poetry ^Ö which is not to say
I love (all) Nature poetry ^Ö implies an easy dismissal of the natural world
(perhaps for its overwhelming amorality).
        I^Òm not citing Glazier and Spahr to condemn them. Glazier knows a lot more
about digital poetry and the Web, its history and possibilities, than I do.
It^Òs this discourse and the political claims that he and you and others
make, that I take offense to. If this discourse did not exist, I probably
wouldn^Òt be opening my mouth. One could simply judge a poem or artwork ^Ö
digital, print-based or whatever ^Ö on its aesthetic and intellectual merits
(which is not exactly what I^Òm advocating). But in order to justify or sell
the poetry and get into those institutional arenas that you mention, you
need the discourse ^Ö perhaps not you in particular, but others who seem
invested in a form of academic politics that parades as revolutionary
(because it is supposedly technically innovative). You need "strategically
useful theoretical gestures^Ô to displace those who support ^Óconfessional,
"I"-centered modes of discourse^Ô in the current ^Ópoetic economy.^Ô And to
what end? What does this academic ^Óoppositionality^Ô have to do with
^Óovercom[ing] the exploitations and objectifications which arise from
capitalist modes of production?^Ô I^Òm afraid not much. You make the leap from
fighting the confessionalist horde to fighting capitalism and waging class
struggle in a record .0003 seconds. I would agree that ^Óde-centered writing^Ô
^Ö in the aftermath of the 60s and the failure of a united counterculture --
was once radical, and perhaps still is despite the reification of the
discourse, if only because it alerts the reader to the objectification and
reification that capitalism injects into all areas of life and experience.
It puts it right in your face without the mediation of an ^ÓI.^Ô But it did
not, and could not, change any ^Ñsocial conditions.^Ò Nor did it present any
possible solutions to alienation, reification, etc. These are claims your
post seems to be making.
        If I want a return to anything it^Òs to the moment before poetry split into
^Ñconfessionalist^Ò and ^Ñmaterialist^Ò modes. Before the split between
intellect and emotion, thinking and feeling, experience and language. The
binary division you make between ^Ñproductive^Ò materiality and
^Ñcounter-productive^Ò emotion or sincerity is not mine. The poets I cite at
one point ^Ö Rimbaud, Blake, Vallejo, Rukeyser, Cesaire, Artaud ^Ö are
examples of a wide tradition of revolutionary poetry that treats, to use a
Glazierian term, the ^ÓI,^Ô authority, expression and emotion as the fluid
elements they are, above mere egoism or confession, in a ^Ñpractice^Ò that is
irreducible to any discourse or catty battle between overfed pedagogical
models. Radicality has been codified into non-normativity, alternative
textuality and a reified institutional discourse all of which willfully
^Óreduce[] the ^Ñauthoring^Ò subject to a machine, an alienated, non-expressive
object of ideology^Ô ^Ö your words, but they sound ironized to me. I don^Òt see
any radical political value in this reduction of possibility. Nor do I see
any revolutionary political agency in the mocking of sincerity, a move which
almost certainly guarantees marginality, institutional or otherwise (but who
knows, insincerity loves capitalism and capitalism cares for nothing more
than the next quarter^Òs earnings ^Ö it doesn^Òt care for ^Ñsubjects^Ò, in bulk
or in the singular). If you did not respond to my post, Matt, with some
degree of sincerity, obviously we wouldn^Òt be having this discussion.
        De-centered or materialist modes haven^Òt resulted in the jettisoning of the
ego or self because they still operate in a competitive literary economy
which is becoming commodified as any other. Whether or not a poet uses the
^ÓI,^Ô their subjectivity or ^Ñhabitus^Ò will still be present. A poet can use
the ^ÓI^Ô not to refer to him or herself or can use means other than the ^ÓI^Ô
to refer to a self, but try all you might to become a faceless discourse
machine (institutional martyr) ^Ö the dream of every little boy and girl on
this Earth -- and the truth will eventually out. I don^Òt think capitalism
created the ^ÓI,^Ô emotions, selves, the ego or the need to be sincere.
Ashbery would seem to be the best example of someone clearly embraced by the
mainstream but who gets rid of the ^ÓI^Ô as a locus of meaning and expression;
sort of gets rid of the ego and doesn^Òt get rid of the self; is innovative
at times and productive in a machine-like way; writes from his oceanic well
of fancy more than from direct experience; foregrounds the materiality of
the medium but not all the goddamn time; flattens emotion and tone (to a
register of tender melancholia and heady humor) and poses no threat at all
to the cultural status quo in the poetic economy or abroad. Like most
de-centered writing IT^ÒS HARMLESSLY QUIESCENT ^Ö a noise that doesn^Òt make
much noise. Then again, I^Òd rather read Ashbery more than 95 percent of
what^Òs out there just because he writes great, if lullaby-like, poetry, you
know. It strives for the infinite, even if it^Òs just in dreams. It may not
^Ófight for heaven^Ô(Lorca^Òs phrase) but I^Òm cool with it every other
Thursday, ten to eleven p.m. Central Standard Time.
        I agree with you that some of the lines in ^ÓPoetry as Social Practice^Ô
punch low, so to speak, and are not good for much than a laugh, but other
arguments are harder to dismiss. Yes, ^Óby arranging each of [my] ^Ñslogans^Ò
in a context which deems them ridiculous, [I] end up privileging the exact
opposite of whatever they say.^Ô You are right;  I think they are ridiculous.
I don^Òt, however, agree that ^Óby ironizing a statement like ^ÑDon't be
crazy,^Ò [I] end up advocating a statement like ^ÑBe crazy.^Ò^Ô What I^Òm
advocating is the questioning of what a discourse of non-normativity
implies, promotes and rejects. What it rejects, as you^Òve done well to point
out, is a relevance of emotion (the sincere kind) and feeling. Emotions are
considered irrational, but emotions never lie (thus the line ^ÓMock sincerity
sincerely^Ô). Reason and language enable one to lie. So it looks like I^Òm
advocating irrationality as if going mad didn^Òt have its own reasons and
causes. I don^Òt think I^Òm advocating a poetics of anything (yet -- is that
not being ideological enough?), much less 'experience' but if I had to take
side I'd come on the side of experience and not the decentered, materialist
poetics tractor. I think for those who don^Òt have much going on in their
lives, a poetics of anti-experience is a sweet alternative to, and
distillation of, its hectic monotony.

(Okay, I give up, I am urging that people go crazy!!! Like at raves where
kids and maybe some adults get together and dance to all kinds of techno
music, turning the machine against itself, experiencing the magic of being
alive for a few hours before returning to further drudgery ^Ö crazy like
that, good crazy!!!)

Now I am going to do what Kafka did the day WWI broke out: go swimming.

More later,

 Dear David Hess,

I liked your piece on 'Poetry and Social Practice'. It is important to laugh.

Don't much matter how beautiful the idea is that one is laughing at: as soon as it's taken too seriously, it's dangerous.

My 2 cents anyhow.

Cheers,

Cassie Lewis

phenomenology of approach


this time it was the loxahatchee, jacek and i overturned the canoe on a
three-foot drop, digital nikon overboard.

( it worked for a minute for a moment.
( the card caught its dying breaths.
(  in the beginning, some lacewing eggs followed by a scale insect
(  then the clearing with paurotis, cypress, fern ( what might have been
(   ( an alligator hole ) )
(   then the clearing again
(    suddenly:
(    the switch: this was the portage route which we ignored
(    sondheim soaking, filmed with the dying camera
(     ( it seemed alive at that point, the images as usual
(     jacek by the canoe, clive and jane by the canoe
(   the next image is blurred, green, railing and water
(    the camera was dying
(    the lens, clouded, electronics shutting down
(     ( oh how i worked to retrieve the images! how many hours of
(     coaxing them from the card! )
(   following, the last retrievable series:
(    blue blurs through the ruined lens
(      sondheim in mourning and recuperation
(      the final image but one, the light
(      the final image, the car and its drowned technology

(      the madness of the image
(      the madness of the light

(      madness of the image

<DIV></DIV>&gt;Subject: Response to Matt
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Date: Sat, 13 Apr 2002 01:46:59 -0400
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Dear Matt,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Thank you for a very articulate response to my questions. I^Òm afraid
<DIV></DIV>&gt;some of
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the ^Óexaggerations,^Ô as you call them, that are presented in ^ÓPoetry
<DIV></DIV>&gt;as
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Social Practice,^Ô aren^Òt very far from the actual arguments that
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I^Òve come
<DIV></DIV>&gt;across in my reading of ^Óde-centered writing^Ô and ^Óinnovative
<DIV></DIV>&gt;practice^Ô^Òs
<DIV></DIV>&gt;contemporary supporters. The following quotation that come towards
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the end
<DIV></DIV>&gt;can be found word-for-word in Loss Pequeno Glazier^Òs new book
<DIV></DIV>&gt;^ÓDigital
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Poetics: The Making of E-Poetries^Ô:
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;^ÓNon-innovative literature can be said to possess a number of
<DIV></DIV>&gt;distinguishing
<DIV></DIV>&gt;textual features. These can include narrative, plot, anecdotal
<DIV></DIV>&gt;re-telling of
<DIV></DIV>&gt;human experiences, logical descriptions, chronological sequences of
<DIV></DIV>&gt;events,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;a reliance on factual information, a view of language as a
<DIV></DIV>&gt;transparent (or
<DIV></DIV>&gt;at most, tinted) bearer of meaning, and an attachment to a Modernist
<DIV></DIV>&gt;aesthetic. Such texts often base their authority on the foundation
<DIV></DIV>&gt;of the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;certainty of semantic meaning.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;An innovative text treats the making of meaning as problematic.^Ô
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I can^Òt help but think Mr. Glazier is not paying much attention to
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;meaning he makes, the language he uses, a form of discourse he
<DIV></DIV>&gt;undoubtedly
<DIV></DIV>&gt;did not invent himself but learned and adopted in our institutions
<DIV></DIV>&gt;of higher
<DIV></DIV>&gt;learning. (Isn't more important how these elements -- "factual
<DIV></DIV>&gt;information,"
<DIV></DIV>&gt;narrative, etc -- are used and not whether or not they are used?)
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Near the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;end of his book, Glazier writes that ^Óit is not necessarily
<DIV></DIV>&gt;culturally
<DIV></DIV>&gt;productive to fell things, traditions or forests for profit or other
<DIV></DIV>&gt;reasons.^Ô Ignoring for a second the unstated meaning of ^Ñculturally
<DIV></DIV>&gt;productive^Ò and the standard diplomatic ^Ñnot necessarily^Ò (I wonder
<DIV></DIV>&gt;what his
<DIV></DIV>&gt;criteria for felling things is ^Ö for me it^Òs lies), I find the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;reduction of
<DIV></DIV>&gt;culture (whether poetry or something else) to certain traits ^Ö or a
<DIV></DIV>&gt;bunch of
<DIV></DIV>&gt;material or ideology ^Ö to be not unlike the reduction of people to
<DIV></DIV>&gt;certain
<DIV></DIV>&gt;traits or material to be exploited for purely economic or
<DIV></DIV>&gt;^Ñculturally
<DIV></DIV>&gt;productive^Ò reasons. Hence the sequence ^ÓThe use of multiple ^ÓI^Ôs
<DIV></DIV>&gt;marks
<DIV></DIV>&gt;poetry as innovative. People who have dark skin pigment are less
<DIV></DIV>&gt;than human^Ô
<DIV></DIV>&gt;in my post. Hence, again, the sequence ^ÓNature is immoral. It
<DIV></DIV>&gt;doesn^Òt even
<DIV></DIV>&gt;exist, which is the greatest immorality of all. Don^Òt let it inspire
<DIV></DIV>&gt;you^Ô --
<DIV></DIV>&gt;a detournement of Juliana Spahr^Òs comment ^ÓNature poetry is immoral^Ô
<DIV></DIV>&gt;--
<DIV></DIV>&gt;quoted in the most recent Poetry Project Newsletter. Like Jesse
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Helms
<DIV></DIV>&gt;finding a Mapplethorpe photo disgusting because he finds the subject
<DIV></DIV>&gt;matter
<DIV></DIV>&gt;disgusting, I think Spahr^Òs dismissal of Nature poetry ^Ö which is
<DIV></DIV>&gt;not to say
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I love (all) Nature poetry ^Ö implies an easy dismissal of the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;natural world
<DIV></DIV>&gt;(perhaps for its overwhelming amorality).
<DIV></DIV>&gt; I^Òm not citing Glazier and Spahr to condemn them. Glazier
<DIV></DIV>&gt;knows a lot more
<DIV></DIV>&gt;about digital poetry and the Web, its history and possibilities,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;than I do.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;It^Òs this discourse and the political claims that he and you and
<DIV></DIV>&gt;others
<DIV></DIV>&gt;make, that I take offense to. If this discourse did not exist, I
<DIV></DIV>&gt;probably
<DIV></DIV>&gt;wouldn^Òt be opening my mouth. One could simply judge a poem or
<DIV></DIV>&gt;artwork ^Ö
<DIV></DIV>&gt;digital, print-based or whatever ^Ö on its aesthetic and intellectual
<DIV></DIV>&gt;merits
<DIV></DIV>&gt;(which is not exactly what I^Òm advocating). But in order to justify
<DIV></DIV>&gt;or sell
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the poetry and get into those institutional arenas that you mention,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;you
<DIV></DIV>&gt;need the discourse ^Ö perhaps not you in particular, but others who
<DIV></DIV>&gt;seem
<DIV></DIV>&gt;invested in a form of academic politics that parades as
<DIV></DIV>&gt;revolutionary
<DIV></DIV>&gt;(because it is supposedly technically innovative). You need
<DIV></DIV>&gt;"strategically
<DIV></DIV>&gt;useful theoretical gestures^Ô to displace those who support
<DIV></DIV>&gt;^Óconfessional,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;"I"-centered modes of discourse^Ô in the current ^Ópoetic economy.^Ô
<DIV></DIV>&gt;And to
<DIV></DIV>&gt;what end? What does this academic ^Óoppositionality^Ô have to do with
<DIV></DIV>&gt;^Óovercom[ing] the exploitations and objectifications which arise
<DIV></DIV>&gt;from
<DIV></DIV>&gt;capitalist modes of production?^Ô I^Òm afraid not much. You make the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;leap from
<DIV></DIV>&gt;fighting the confessionalist horde to fighting capitalism and waging
<DIV></DIV>&gt;class
<DIV></DIV>&gt;struggle in a record .0003 seconds. I would agree that ^Óde-centered
<DIV></DIV>&gt;writing^Ô
<DIV></DIV>&gt;^Ö in the aftermath of the 60s and the failure of a united
<DIV></DIV>&gt;counterculture --
<DIV></DIV>&gt;was once radical, and perhaps still is despite the reification of
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;discourse, if only because it alerts the reader to the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;objectification and
<DIV></DIV>&gt;reification that capitalism injects into all areas of life and
<DIV></DIV>&gt;experience.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;It puts it right in your face without the mediation of an ^ÓI.^Ô But
<DIV></DIV>&gt;it did
<DIV></DIV>&gt;not, and could not, change any ^Ñsocial conditions.^Ò Nor did it
<DIV></DIV>&gt;present any
<DIV></DIV>&gt;possible solutions to alienation, reification, etc. These are claims
<DIV></DIV>&gt;your
<DIV></DIV>&gt;post seems to be making.
<DIV></DIV>&gt; If I want a return to anything it^Òs to the moment before
<DIV></DIV>&gt;poetry split into
<DIV></DIV>&gt;^Ñconfessionalist^Ò and ^Ñmaterialist^Ò modes. Before the split between
<DIV></DIV>&gt;intellect and emotion, thinking and feeling, experience and
<DIV></DIV>&gt;language. The
<DIV></DIV>&gt;binary division you make between ^Ñproductive^Ò materiality and
<DIV></DIV>&gt;^Ñcounter-productive^Ò emotion or sincerity is not mine. The poets I
<DIV></DIV>&gt;cite at
<DIV></DIV>&gt;one point ^Ö Rimbaud, Blake, Vallejo, Rukeyser, Cesaire, Artaud ^Ö are
<DIV></DIV>&gt;examples of a wide tradition of revolutionary poetry that treats, to
<DIV></DIV>&gt;use a
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Glazierian term, the ^ÓI,^Ô authority, expression and emotion as the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;fluid
<DIV></DIV>&gt;elements they are, above mere egoism or confession, in a ^Ñpractice^Ò
<DIV></DIV>&gt;that is
<DIV></DIV>&gt;irreducible to any discourse or catty battle between overfed
<DIV></DIV>&gt;pedagogical
<DIV></DIV>&gt;models. Radicality has been codified into non-normativity,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;alternative
<DIV></DIV>&gt;textuality and a reified institutional discourse all of which
<DIV></DIV>&gt;willfully
<DIV></DIV>&gt;^Óreduce[] the ^Ñauthoring^Ò subject to a machine, an alienated,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;non-expressive
<DIV></DIV>&gt;object of ideology^Ô ^Ö your words, but they sound ironized to me. I
<DIV></DIV>&gt;don^Òt see
<DIV></DIV>&gt;any radical political value in this reduction of possibility. Nor do
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I see
<DIV></DIV>&gt;any revolutionary political agency in the mocking of sincerity, a
<DIV></DIV>&gt;move which
<DIV></DIV>&gt;almost certainly guarantees marginality, institutional or otherwise
<DIV></DIV>&gt;(but who
<DIV></DIV>&gt;knows, insincerity loves capitalism and capitalism cares for nothing
<DIV></DIV>&gt;more
<DIV></DIV>&gt;than the next quarter^Òs earnings ^Ö it doesn^Òt care for ^Ñsubjects^Ò,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;in bulk
<DIV></DIV>&gt;or in the singular). If you did not respond to my post, Matt, with
<DIV></DIV>&gt;some
<DIV></DIV>&gt;degree of sincerity, obviously we wouldn^Òt be having this
<DIV></DIV>&gt;discussion.
<DIV></DIV>&gt; De-centered or materialist modes haven^Òt resulted in the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;jettisoning of the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;ego or self because they still operate in a competitive literary
<DIV></DIV>&gt;economy
<DIV></DIV>&gt;which is becoming commodified as any other. Whether or not a poet
<DIV></DIV>&gt;uses the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;^ÓI,^Ô their subjectivity or ^Ñhabitus^Ò will still be present. A poet
<DIV></DIV>&gt;can use
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the ^ÓI^Ô not to refer to him or herself or can use means other than
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the ^ÓI^Ô
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to refer to a self, but try all you might to become a faceless
<DIV></DIV>&gt;discourse
<DIV></DIV>&gt;machine (institutional martyr) ^Ö the dream of every little boy and
<DIV></DIV>&gt;girl on
<DIV></DIV>&gt;this Earth -- and the truth will eventually out. I don^Òt think
<DIV></DIV>&gt;capitalism
<DIV></DIV>&gt;created the ^ÓI,^Ô emotions, selves, the ego or the need to be
<DIV></DIV>&gt;sincere.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Ashbery would seem to be the best example of someone clearly
<DIV></DIV>&gt;embraced by the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;mainstream but who gets rid of the ^ÓI^Ô as a locus of meaning and
<DIV></DIV>&gt;expression;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;sort of gets rid of the ego and doesn^Òt get rid of the self; is
<DIV></DIV>&gt;innovative
<DIV></DIV>&gt;at times and productive in a machine-like way; writes from his
<DIV></DIV>&gt;oceanic well
<DIV></DIV>&gt;of fancy more than from direct experience; foregrounds the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;materiality of
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the medium but not all the goddamn time; flattens emotion and tone
<DIV></DIV>&gt;(to a
<DIV></DIV>&gt;register of tender melancholia and heady humor) and poses no threat
<DIV></DIV>&gt;at all
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to the cultural status quo in the poetic economy or abroad. Like
<DIV></DIV>&gt;most
<DIV></DIV>&gt;de-centered writing IT^ÒS HARMLESSLY QUIESCENT ^Ö a noise that doesn^Òt
<DIV></DIV>&gt;make
<DIV></DIV>&gt;much noise. Then again, I^Òd rather read Ashbery more than 95 percent
<DIV></DIV>&gt;of
<DIV></DIV>&gt;what^Òs out there just because he writes great, if lullaby-like,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;poetry, you
<DIV></DIV>&gt;know. It strives for the infinite, even if it^Òs just in dreams. It
<DIV></DIV>&gt;may not
<DIV></DIV>&gt;^Ófight for heaven^Ô(Lorca^Òs phrase) but I^Òm cool with it every other
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Thursday, ten to eleven p.m. Central Standard Time.
<DIV></DIV>&gt; I agree with you that some of the lines in ^ÓPoetry as Social
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Practice^Ô
<DIV></DIV>&gt;punch low, so to speak, and are not good for much than a laugh, but
<DIV></DIV>&gt;other
<DIV></DIV>&gt;arguments are harder to dismiss. Yes, ^Óby arranging each of [my]
<DIV></DIV>&gt;^Ñslogans^Ò
<DIV></DIV>&gt;in a context which deems them ridiculous, [I] end up privileging the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;exact
<DIV></DIV>&gt;opposite of whatever they say.^Ô You are right; I think they are
<DIV></DIV>&gt;ridiculous.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I don^Òt, however, agree that ^Óby ironizing a statement like ^ÑDon't
<DIV></DIV>&gt;be
<DIV></DIV>&gt;crazy,^Ò [I] end up advocating a statement like ^ÑBe crazy.^Ò^Ô What I^Òm
<DIV></DIV>&gt;advocating is the questioning of what a discourse of non-normativity
<DIV></DIV>&gt;implies, promotes and rejects. What it rejects, as you^Òve done well
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to point
<DIV></DIV>&gt;out, is a relevance of emotion (the sincere kind) and feeling.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Emotions are
<DIV></DIV>&gt;considered irrational, but emotions never lie (thus the line ^ÓMock
<DIV></DIV>&gt;sincerity
<DIV></DIV>&gt;sincerely^Ô). Reason and language enable one to lie. So it looks like
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I^Òm
<DIV></DIV>&gt;advocating irrationality as if going mad didn^Òt have its own reasons
<DIV></DIV>&gt;and
<DIV></DIV>&gt;causes. I don^Òt think I^Òm advocating a poetics of anything (yet --
<DIV></DIV>&gt;is that
<DIV></DIV>&gt;not being ideological enough?), much less 'experience' but if I had
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to take
<DIV></DIV>&gt;side I'd come on the side of experience and not the decentered,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;materialist
<DIV></DIV>&gt;poetics tractor. I think for those who don^Òt have much going on in
<DIV></DIV>&gt;their
<DIV></DIV>&gt;lives, a poetics of anti-experience is a sweet alternative to, and
<DIV></DIV>&gt;distillation of, its hectic monotony.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;(Okay, I give up, I am urging that people go crazy!!! Like at raves
<DIV></DIV>&gt;where
<DIV></DIV>&gt;kids and maybe some adults get together and dance to all kinds of
<DIV></DIV>&gt;techno
<DIV></DIV>&gt;music, turning the machine against itself, experiencing the magic of
<DIV></DIV>&gt;being
<DIV></DIV>&gt;alive for a few hours before returning to further drudgery ^Ö crazy
<DIV></DIV>&gt;like
<DIV></DIV>&gt;that, good crazy!!!)
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Now I am going to do what Kafka did the day WWI broke out: go
<DIV></DIV>&gt;swimming.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;

Hello List,

I^Òve been thinking more about the use of the word ^Ómaterial^Ô in terms like
^Ómaterialist poetics,^Ô ^Ómaterial expression,^Ô ^Óaesthetico-material project^Ô
and ^Ómaterialist critique.^Ô These terms would seem to connote something
rigorous and politically motivated but they seem pretty slippery, in fact
they seem to argue for an indeterminate poetics whose main goal is that
slippage of semantic meanings we^Òve all heard about. Abstract instead of
material or concrete. More chosen for their aesthetic value than for the
political meaning that ^Ómaterialist^Ô would imply ^Ö socialist, realist,
revolutionary. I also sense that language here is to be seen as a system
that the poet, writer, programmer, is to manipulate disinterestedly in order
to produce texts that constitute an intervention, fragments of a discursive
formation (movement), in the poetic economy. I hear echoes of T.S. Eliot^Òs
call to remove personality (^Ópoetry is an escape from emotion^Ô ^Ö emotion for
him probably felt like alienation) from the language (in order to purify it
and enter the Western canon). Coolidge is a poet who creates materialist,
i.e. obdurate, poems/texts which are not mimetic of much else but other art
forms (jazz, Kerouackian rhythms, abstract and cubist painting) and his own
thought processes (thereby making it hermetic). Matthew Garite writes that
^Ócapitalism has a love affair with entrepreneurial, DIY subjective agents,^Ô
but the thrust of a materialist poetics appears to be the production (the
writing machine) and distribution (the network) of texts that produce
entrepreneurial subjective agents (readers/consumers whose directive is to
supposedly produce their own meaning ^Ö DIY). Why are we to presume that a
materialist poetics is necessarily anti-capitalist?

There^Òs a lot of emphasis placed on production and consumption in our
current avant garde poetic economy, just like in the capitalist cultural
status quo. What is missing? This is a diagram that might help:

Air:  floaty, indeterminate, permissive-mobile, multiple-dispersed,
surfaces, neuter
Matter:  obdurate, discrete, social-mechanical, united-territorial,
objects-thingness, unisex
Fire:  immediate, expressive, transformative, aggressive-transgressive,
energy-growth, masculine
Water: imaginal, transpersonal, adhesive-receptive, connective-intuitive,
depths, feminine

We live in an Airmatter regime. We are without Firewater.

David.  I agree a lot. Marx's intention  believe was to differentiate
Materilist thought from Idealist.  And many subsequent marxists and others
have a) turned Marx into a kind of saint or Great Leader and they moved from
using the Bible as atext to using Marx or Lenin's adn others' writings and
b) have not thought through the complexities of  the term "material".  Eliot
was far from "removed" from emotion: there is no poetry of any value, no
art, that does not have the force of emotion and intellection behind it: I'm
no Joyce expert but I would guess that as important as anything was the
death of his mother in his writings and the madness of his daughter....and
Eliot would have "resttrained" his emotions: control...which control can be
good to some extent: taken to extremes (as inthe cliche of the "stiff upper
lip Englishman"   (who hardly exists except in so far as he/she is thus
culturally influenced) Eliot fell in love with and was fascinated by ideas
and by History and Religion: nothing wrong with these things ... and to
ceratin people in our (and other) culure(s) there is always more or less
alienation: thus in art we see degrees of intellection versus emotion: in
all  cases the mind is working and or the "soul" (whatever that mysterious
thing is): I would say that Eliot, Pound were very feeling people: but in
some respects they had lost touch with the "tribe" which is partly
(paradoxically) their importance just as Wallace Steven's and even Williams
racialism and male -cahuvinism are PART :  a paradoxically very important
part of what they are.  In some respects one can se Eliot of  ""Four
Quartets" initiating what Zukofsky was to take further: the aspiration
toward music, the sense of the mysterious, of sexual hints and memory,of
evocation, of light: of intellect dancing with emotion:  two are always
combined....even in the sentence based poetry of Heijinian's "The Cell" (as
an example) the sometimes seemingly disconnected and often obscure lines
will have no use to us if they dont lead back to fundamental human thoughts,
feelings, concerns: "nothing is about"  is  what I thought was a clever
line, but equally, "everything is about": its no good just echoing Bernstein
etal about material construction and the construction of meaning etc these
are great ideas coming somwhat from Barthes and maybe Wittgenstein  (I
believe) but all that's useless without a poetic sense: there is something
that lies, despite all the talk, "too deep for thought".
  But that's not to deny the need for constant experimentatioona and formal
invention they are integral to the exploration: the adventure, the
experience...part of the need to revitalise language constantly: like the
Red Queen in Alice we have to race to keep up with ourselves and our life
and times and Chess games (sorry, had to include chess!): but there are
certain constants: oe,terror, passion (your fire), death, consiousness and
so on.  Just some thoughts: not meaning to "lecture" ... just some thoughts.
Probably there's some truth in the reason for the usage of terminology -
aesthetic rather than political-technical - and that isnt always bad: but
the politicalnesss of what we are doing maybe needs to be revistied to
clarify these terms you refer to. Regards, Richard.

I am a naive person who will attempt to define langugae poetry based on
actually reading it; I know this is a hopelessly simplistic idea because one
is supposed to answer questions such as this based on difficult theory...
(I am replying to a challenge to describe what is languag poetry as a style
other than by saying it is associated with a paritcular group of poets who
practice it, which is why I do the definition without reference to actual
poets.  I am being an especial idiot to try to do this and CC to the POETICS
list, because I know that a binch of major language poets are on the list --
but I'm curious what they think of my impressina of what they do!)

Language poetry is poetry in which chunks of some size, ranging from the
word to the stanza appear to have no connection with subsequent chunks.  The
chunks themselves may or may not me intellegible, but they tend either to
represent complex nouns without verbs or nonsense narrative. But the
essential feature is the lack of correlation between successive chunks.

Because they cannot say anything upon a first, sequential, reading, either
narratively, lyrically, or philosophically, given the above, language poems
are only readable if they are funny (which they often are) or beautiful, but
they  are suspect if beautiful.  (They are not suspect if they are
unreadable.)  They may use techniques of traditional poetries within chunks,
such as realistic free verse, Modernism, various past postmodernisms, etc.

Upon actual study, such as analysis of what the chunks in the poem seem to
be about as a whole and what the style of the chunks implies about their
meaning, some meaning can be extracted from the language poem, but it is not
fashionable to do this, because it goes against the the theory of language
poetry which claims that the style is based on drawing attention to the
physicality of language itself, divorced from meaning.  However there is no
evidence that anyone, including the authors of the various manifestos on
language poetry, ever wrote a long poem that did this, which is good news,
because their poems were better than they would have been had they followed
their theories to the letter...

The above is primarily about book-length language poems.  There are some
good (and entertaining) books such as Bernstein's new With Strings which
have short poems which really are divorced from meaning, and yet are well
worth reading.

Does "language poetry" refer to an intelligable type of poetry in a more
clearly representational manner than it does to an age or time and specific
figures in that time?

If you were to try to describe that type of poetry, I think we would all get
a chuckle. Interesting things could be said about that type of poetry,
certainly. But what about the next language poem or poet you haven't
accounted for, and his/her work. It mightn't fit so nicely within the
categorization. Indeed, we are assured that the poets have been as contrary
as possible within whatever limits they have set for themselves. We are,
after all, chasing people into categories who have devoted their lives to
avoiding being easily categorized.

Why do we bother?

Well, if we are kind, we do not intend to pen and torture them with
blustering inaccurate generalizations that at once slay all sense and
sharpen our own blade. Instead, in seeking to understand the moment of the
art, its significance, its methods, its subjects and interests, its
philosophies and criticality, and so on, we are reduced to a need for words
in which to discuss the matter, words that are themselves reductive of that
time, art, and the people who practiced it.

Of course, strong attempts to understand these things are important.

Yet I think you may grant by now that "language poetry" is less clearly
intelligable as a *type* of poetry than as something associated with a
particular age or time and with specific figures in that time.

PS: I sought the nature of The One or, to lose from the outset, oneness and
witnessed the waving of hands. It was explained to me that it was necessary
to wave one's hands on such points and precisely why. Is there oneness apart
from the set of all things that are one? Socrates remarked to the straw man
during a search for 'the good' that he wasn't looking for example but for
what is common to all the examples.

I feel sort of proud that I can say something so mundane and get
compared to someone such as Jesse Helms. But I also feel it would be
improper to me to take credit for such an extreme position.

My Poetry Project newsletter has not arrived yet so I'm not sure what
exactly Hesse is quoting. And I have to admit that I did say this at a
reading. Yet if Hess had been at the reading he might have realized that
I was not dismissing the natural world in favor of the electronic or
that I am against I centered poetries or whatever it is he seems to want
to say in his post which I find confusing.

My take on how nature poetry is immoral is not a dismissal of all nature
poetry or the natural world. It is more a very small complaint about a
specific sort of nature poetry that isolates a certain plant or animal
for heroic purposes w/o addressing the history of these plants and
animals and their relations with various sorts of humans and/or how
these plants and animals are seriously at risk. (I believe even at the
reading I said the sort of nature poetry that gets written in my
department; someone I know is famous for having edited a book of nature
poetry about Hawai'i which had no Hawaiians in it and few people who
even grew up in Hawai'i--it is full of what gets called 747 poems
there.)

More specifically, I remember saying that nature poetry is immoral
because it shows the bird but not the bulldozer that is threatening the
bird's habitat. Not that radical a position. Not based on disgust of
nature but rather on respect for it.

I was also talking about Hawai'i where one can read a poem about the
beauty of a certain plant, say the passion flower aka liliko'i aka
huehue haloe, and yet not realize that the plant arrived from Brazil and
showed up in Maui in 1888 (around the time of annexation--certain
political moments like contact and annexation dramatically changed the
plants and animals of Hawai'i this in turn endangered various species
and created hardship for the humans who used these species for food and
clothing, etc.) and that the plant smothers shrubs, small trees and the
ground layer. In some areas it also smothers the upper canopy layer.

And then I read a poem where I was attempting to think about nature
poetry and how it might represent the interconnected system of the
natural world rather than the individual plant as divorced from its
habitat. It pays homage to much of the nature poetry of Hawai'i,
especially the creation chant of the Kumulipo which is distinctive for
how it presents the process of creation as connection:

285. Born was the Wood borer, a parent
Out came its child a flying thing, and flew
Born was the Caterpillar, the parent
Out came its child a Moth, and flew
Born was the Ant, the parent
290. Out came its child a Dragonfly, and flew
Born was the Grub, the parent
Out came its child the Grasshopper, and flew
Born was the Pinworm, the parent
Out came its child a Fly, and flew
295. Born was the egg [?], the parent
Out came its child a bird, and flew
Born was the Snipe, the parent
Out came its child a Plover,

The Beckwith translation of the Kumulipo is on the web:
http://www.sacred-texts.com/pac/ku/

The poem I then read was called "Nature Poetry." One section of this
poem in the web at Ampersand: http://www.mprsnd.net/poetry/js003.htm.
Another section of was published in Pom Pom and is available via pdf at
http://www.pompompress.com/PomPom_Issue1.pdf. The poem has six sections
to it. It probably doesn't live up to my hopes for nature poetry but was
written with respect for the genre and a belief in its possibilities.

Thank you very much for your time.

I promised myself I would leave this sort of thing alone, but . . . .  Why
does this annoy me?  Because it ignores the history of innovative writing.
So Ginsberg was not innovative?  Burroughs was not innovative?  Stein was
innovative but Eliot and Pound were not?  Come on!  This hijacking of the
terms "innovative" and "avant-garde" and "experimental" is more a political
gesture than an aesthetic one.  Even a cursory understanding of the history
suggests how narrow minded the above definition is.  Isn't it obvious that
such restrictive ideas inhibit innovation?  Best, Bill

(Doing it this way since I only get two posts a day....)



To Jerrold: A bit confused by your post (which is directed toward me) since
you seem to be responding to William Austin^Òs assertion that the rigid
distinction Glazier makes between innovative and non-innovative is political
and not aesthetic. My sense is that it^Òs academically political while the
notion of ^Ómaterialist^Ô ^Ö opaque, indeterminate, obdurate text, language as
system ^Ö is entirely aesthetic. Weird how those who are supposed to be
workers of language have such trouble communicating.

To Michael: So, Tralfamadorean is good? If I ever start a soccer team I will
call ourselves the Tralfamadoreans.

To Vernon: Is Cuspidor also good?

To Juliana: Thank you, thank you Juliana for clearing that up. Obviously, I
had no knowledge of the context in which that statement was made. In my
^ÓResponse to Matt^Ô I was going to say something like ^ÓNo, I don^Òt think you
are like Jesse Helms^Ô but I assumed that by saying I did not want to condemn
you or Mr. Glazier I was not making such a strict association. You say you
are not sure what it is I want ^Ö perhaps some kind of de-decentered poetry,
or ^Ócentered^Ô poetry as you say. I thought I was explicit in the Matt
response about my desire for a poetry which put an end to this opposition of
thought and feeling which has taken hold in the wake of the split into
^Óconfessionalist^Ô (emotional) and ^Ómaterialist^Ô (intellectual) modes. I
listed a few poets that I thought were revolutionary in what they were
^Ósaying^Ô as well as what they were doing with language and form.

To Richard: I appreciate the reading, Richard, and don^Òt mind being lectured
to if there^Òs something to be learned. I agree that formal experimentation
is an important part of making art and it looks the advances that are going
to be made now will be in the digital realm. Nothing wrong with that. My big
beef is with these revolutionary claims being made for poetry that is
focused on technical experimentation and not much else. The lyrics make the
song as much as the instrumentation.

To Chris: I wonder what it^Òs like to be one of your students.

To Matt: Please come back and tell us your thoughts.

To others: Some further discussion on what ^Ómaterialist critique,^Ô ^Ómaterial
expression,^Ô etc. means would be nice. Barrett Watten, Patrick Durgin, Ron
Silliman, Kasey Mohammad ^Ö please step up.

Thanks,
Dave

P.S.: if anyone still thinks I^Òm Matt Garite please back-channel me and I
will prove it, if it means that much to you.

ah, I see now that this was a quote. missed the quotation marks around what
Austin was responding to. at any rate, the attempt to pigeonhole what,
exactly, constitutes an innovative aesthetic, is, to my mind (& as you
suggest) academically political (it does little except to make a
dissertation more interesting (or not)), &, for the most part, smacks of an
aesthetic conservatism that misses the point entirely.

WORKSHOP
Poetry as (Local) History

(Alan Gilbert & Mark Nowak)
This workshop will explore the interstices between writing poetry and
writing (local) history. Workshop leaders Mark Nowak and Alan Gilbert will
discuss the writings of several poets whose work is grounded in an
exploration of history (local, regional, etc.). In addition to a
bibliography of "Poetry as (Local) History" for further reading and
research, each participant will receive a copy of Xcp: Cross Cultural
Poetics that includes writings on the workshop theme by poet Fred Wah,
anthropologist Lila Abu-Lughod, Roger Sanjek's fieldwork in
Queens, reviews of Paul Metcalf's Collected Works, and more. The workshop
will conclude with a discussion of participants current (or future)
projects in this area and various poetic approaches that might be employed
in their writing of (local) history as poetry.

Alan Gilbert's writings on poetry, art, and politics have appeared in a
number of publications, including Afterimage, Boston Review, and Xcp:
Cross-Cultural Poetics. Recent poems have appeared in The Baffler and First
Intensity. Mark Nowak, author of Revenants, is editor of Xcp:
Cross-Cultural
Poetics and co-editor (with Diane Glancy) of Visit Teepee Town: Native
Writings After the Detours.

Subject:      "a volume of absolutely comparable worth"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

David Hess:

I find your list of acceptable revolutionaries,
"Rimbaud, Blake, Vallejo, Rukeyser, Cesaire, Artaud",
to be less than helpful, in various ways, if I may.
For one, it does not differ greatly (Rimbaud, Artaud)
from the early canon that "materialist" poetics has
been putting forward.  So, going back to what is
virtually the same starting point will only, in the
long run, come full circle and eventually grow into a
"materialist" poetics rediviva.  Second, with the
exception of Rukyser (a "Which One of These Does Not
Belong" peculiar and seemingly personal choice) or the
British Blake, it is decidedly foreign language,
Europhile, and, in lacking even the beginnings of an
American genealogy, it displaces revolutionary
contexts that were very likely specific to their
points of gneration onto an American scene that needs
a somewhat more indigenous topography to take root.
(It is also anachronistic in its arbitrary
leap-frogging back and forth across centuries, David.)
 Thirdly, upon closer inspection, I'm not sure that
brief list holds up to your second criterion, of a
prelapsarian unity of feeling and thought: Artaud, who
simply admitted he couldn't ~think~ anymore, and that
his problem was harrowing inner nullity, was, to my
mind, much more wiped out and disabled as far as
anything like intellect went, and his degenerative
illness was what we loosely refer to as ~"emotional~
illness," so he kind of misses feeling/thought on both
counts, since all his feelings were phantasmagoria and
his paranoia or whatever the specific -phrenia of his
diagnosis no better equipped to write feelings than,
say, a schizoid.

I can understand your hunger to ~start all over~

and the more-or-less
"anti-Language"/anti-"materialist" poetics your
various jeremiads have been dreaming of, from the
standpoint of its having become too easy, too
widespread, too "dumbed down, "pseudo-confessionalist"
in its choosing its materiality from the same sources
as Confessionalism: the accidentals of one's life,
etc.

I think, though, that a call for something new has to
base itself, at some point, David, on something that
~is~ new, and what your essays are missing is an even
provisional indicator of where within American poetry
something resembling your manifesto can already be
seen, if only embryonically.

There's an interesting list that's been passed over
for a long time, as an alternative staring point: the
list of the ~refuse'es~ from the ~In The American
Tree~ anthology.  (I regard ~In The American Tree~ as
the turning point where "materialist" poetries became
organized as such as a sort of full-scale phalanx, and
went from pockets of scattered idiosyncracy to the
national, self-proclaimed party system it has become.)

Silliman's 1st edition introduction reads:

"A volume of absolutely comparable worth could be
constructed from the writing of Tom Ahern, Robert
Gluck, Bruce Boone, Beverly Dahlen, Rosemarie Waldrop,
Karl Young, Alice Notely, (sic) Dick Higgins, Curtis
Faville, Laura Moriarty, Barbara Einzig, Jim
Rosenberg, Laura Chester, Lydia Davis, Johanna
Drucker, Kathleen Fraser, Gloria Frym, Peter Ganick,
Merrill Gilfillan, Ed Friedman, Gerald Burns, Gerritt
Lansing, Chris Mason, Doug Messerli, John Godfrey,
Michael Amnasan, Loris Essary, Keith Waldrop, Geoff
Young, Marshall Reese, Craig Watson, Marina LaPalma,
Steve Roberts, Bernard Welt, Gil Ott, Ted Pearson,
Jerry Estrin, Mark Lecard, Kirby Malong, Norman
Fischer, John Yau, John Taggart, Gail Sher, Joseph
Simas, Cris Cheek, Joan Rettalack, Rafael Lorenzo,
David Gitlin, Jed Rasula, Keith Shein, Charles Stein,
Leslie Scalapino, Michael Lally, Dennis Cooper, Dvid
Benedetti, Bill Mohr, Lelan Hickman, Charles
Amirkhanian, Steve Katz, Doug Lang, Bill Corbett,
Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Maureen Owen, Mei-mei
Berssenbrugge, Aaron Shurin, David Levi-Strauss,
Sandra Meyer, DeLys Mullis, Carole Korzeniowsky,
Frances Jaffer, Donald Byrd, Charles North, Jim
Brodey, Madeleine Burnside, Barbara Barg, Lorenzo
Thomas, Tim Dlugos, Steven Hamilton, Gary Lenhart, and
others."

(It also defines further criteria for exclusion, "For
reasons of ... clarity," as "poets working in other
nations", "those whose primary medium is something
other than poetry", or "whose mature style and public
identity was largely formed prior to this moment in
writing".  I find the second as especially promising,
especially now that digital frontiers do allow a
re-consideration and fresh attention to be given to
"multi-media" poets.)

I've tried before to call attention to this list of
refuse'es and to second-guess what it may conceal:

http://home.jps.net/~nada/shurin.htm .

In most cases, I think, those poets would not have
advanced as well the cause of
"paratactic"/asyntactical poetry, as many of them
continued to write might closer to "normative
discourse."

Some of the Refuse'es were later folded under the
aegis of "materialist"/Language poetry in subsequent
round-ups, or have drifted there over time, perhaps
precisely for want of the lost alternative that that
"volume of absolutely comparable worth" took down with
it.

Even a cursory glance at its names, though, brings up
examples that, in fact, do seem to synthesize feeling
and thought in the way you might envision, such as,
out of the names I recognize, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge,
all of whose books are perfect masterpieces

(the opening of ~Sphericity~: "I did not know
beforehand what would count for me as a new color. Its
beauty is an analysis / of things I believe in or
experience, but seems to alter events very little.
The significance of a bird / flying out of grapes in a
store reates to the beauty of the color of the
translucency of grapes"),

Gerritt Lansing, where alchemical hermeticism met gay
male poetry in a seemingly impossible fusion or
combustion, Dennis Cooper's unique hybrid of political
poetry and idealized self in his J.F.K.-as-a-boy
poems,  Michael Amnasan's chilling frankness about
being ~the~ working class poet, the unsung epic
unruliness of Blau DuPlessis' indefatigable
hodgepodge, etc.

A great deal could be gained, I believe, ---all my
card-catalog-scavenging to find those I could has been
rewarding--- by returning to that fork in the road and
seeing where the history "of winners" that was written
over so many names I've simply never seen elsewhere
diverged from a forgotten possible world.


As far as "materiality,"--- there's been continuous
slippage in that term, and just plain ignorance as to
meaning.  A quasi-Marxist critique such as the
polemics that accompanied "materialist" poetics ~had
to~ have meant, at root, not eclipsing focus on the
~material~ itself, i.e. language, but upon the
material ~conditions~ that surround its production.
At some point, paratactical writing seemed like a
believable hook on which to hang this hat of
materiality.  It did, after all, jolt with a startled
re-encounter with the similar ~materiality~ of ~the
book,~ in, the first few dozen times or some, opening
an innocuous-looking front cover to find a total
contradiction of all expectations within, hence
forcing a re-examination of such expectations.

The difficulty, today, for a reasonably well-read poet
is that, by dint of sheer number, it has been
~normalized.~  ---  Difficulty in the sense that the
original claims about materiality weather poorly, as
the decades since have significantly altered the
material conditions of the poet-producers but rarely
effected a similary telling acknowledgement of that
whole new horizon of materialist realities within the
imitation-of-an-imitation poetry: MFAs, a decline in
the cost of publishing, criticism about said
materiality, etc (to say nothing of the Internet and
the yet unexplored ways in which distribution of print
poetry through Web changes its "materiality"
---immaterializing it?).  There are advantages, too,
in its normalization: the work itself is less
difficult.  It is easier, critically, to see where a
thread of a story or themes do show through.  It's
possible to discuss whole books of paratactic writing
entirely for their "content" (semantics) now, without
re-hashing the arguments in favor of and their
apologetics.  In time, one becomes re-trained or
re-conditioned to read, when it's there, entirely
lucid continuities.  And, likewise, not to waste too
much time getting caught up in "secondary" or tertiary
writing, ... although the political climate of a very
small poetry world continue to make it impossible to
hold up specific cases as "poor" versions of
"materialist" poetics.

At any rate, I do think that distinction important to
put out at the get-go: materiality as, originally, the
materiality of the poet-worker's situation, the
historical materialism of publication, the materiality
of the medium (language) as subject to its
contemporary, time-bound jargons and slangs, etc.
What materiality ~should have~ been meaning all along
is: who wrote it, what (political) groups benefit from
the power relations that it sets in motion, ...

The poetics or theory has gotten progressively muddled
as its lost that key element of its own argument.
Re-embracing the dogma in its more complete form also
allows its expansion across poetries that chance and
power struggles shut out.  You mention Ashbery,--- but
I'm continually intrigued by how much of materialist
poetics fits O'Hara perfectly: the historical
materialist acuteness of the present moment notated in
its chronometric exactitude, poetry as the product not
of the lone individualist (which your Blake and
Rimbaud somewhat harken back to, David) but the
project of an entire community of interrelated
manufacturers, etc.


(I never realized until just now when the radio
announcer said it, that Olivier Messiaen's ~Quartet
for the End of Time~ was written during and given its
first premier in a German prisoner of war camp.)


It's important to keep in mind that the poetry is
separable from the poetics, and that the same body of
"materialist" work can be re-narrativized/theorized
under different rubrics, ... and, vice-versa, that
criteria of materialist dicta are met by work not
typically identified with that banner.

        Hi

        I am coming into this at a late point but I feel Glazier is coming from the
point of innovation from the delivery system associated with literature and
not the clime of the innovation. This political aspect could be applied to
his notion of the multiple I, but look for a post months ago by Jeffrey
Jullich on that. But Glazier's innovation comes from behind the text, not
the text itself. As this message finds its meaning on this list, its coded
and delivered amongst texts and code strings that allow for instantiations
around the readership of this list. This is the innovations of digital
poetries, as the scroll was an innovation to the oral tradition, as
Gutenberg was to same said scrolls, as the internet is to the book format of
hypertexts and such texts will become non-innovative when the linearity of
reading becomes moot. Glazier is onto something here and a closer reading of
_DP_  will show this true. His argument doesn't go beyond this for the
innovative.


                            Best, Geoffrey

ah, I see now that this was a quote. missed the quotation marks around what
Austin was responding to. at any rate, the attempt to pigeonhole what,
exactly, constitutes an innovative aesthetic, is, to my mind (& as you
suggest) academically political (it does little except to make a
dissertation more interesting (or not)), &, for the most part, smacks of an
aesthetic conservatism that misses the point entirely.

Dear Jeffrey,

The list of poets I offered as examples whose work merges thinking and
feeling was not meant to be exhaustive at all. I chose those poets because
they were all PISSED OFF in some way or another -- and they did not exclude
such emotions from their art -- and were nonetheless doing innovative work.
At a couple different places in his book Glazier says that innovative poetry
excludes an "I" which is marked by animosity. I just find that totally
ridiculous. So that's why I wrote this in "Poetry as Social Practice":

"Love and rage shall not go out on dates. The poetry of Blake, Rimbaud,
Cesaire, Rukeyser, Vallejo and Artaud is too full of anger to be
innovative."

Again, emotion need not be divorced from innovation, experimentation,
engagement with the medium. (Yes, it feels like were are in kindegarten
doesn't it). That's all I'm saying there -- not proposing a totally
alternative tradition on which to base a totally new poetics.

Rimbaud and Artaud have never been, to my knowledge, chosen as precedents to
the current materialist tradition. It's been Stein, Zukofsky, Cage and
others.

I gotta be honest and say I read through your post once and have no desire
to read it again. Do you realize that you have a tendency to talk at people,
at least in your writing? For the most part you totally lose me after those
first few paragraphs.

Relax and take a deep breath,

        Hi David,

        I know I'm not the Jeffrey you are speaking of, but the I in Glazier is
very interesting point to bring out in poetry. It's a true enough argument
and I too had difficult accepting it at first. it has an all inclusiveness
that seems yucky at first, but it is quite blithe in spirit. From what I
understand, his goal is the same as asking what makes up the river? The I is
made up of several selves who have a common background as does yours so we
can both be beneficiary of the I intended message taking that I to be you as
me as she. Its very simple yet complex when taking a global community and
not to solitary poet. There is a plurality of identity which at once one
cannot argue against. This is quite a radical notion, as Glazier points out
"such a perspective can be socially beneficial in a heterogeneous society as
it obviates the need for one I to be more valid than others. a concept
disruptive of social equality" (DP 50)

Groupus Listus. I sent on a poem by Tony Folari but also I said of Tony =
that he was obsessed or possessed: I meant in fact that he was =
"extremely keen on" such things as lipograms and so on and things =
Oulipian. I also mentioned the suicide of his brother: I had wrongly =
assumed that Tony's obsession was connected somehow to his brother's =
death but I was in error. Tony informs me he has wide interests and his =
brother's death was due to things unrelated to his own "obsession" (for =
which read "strong interest and concentration on" numbers, puzzles and =
so on) So I must apologise for this and to his mother who was upset.
  If there's else of interest from Tony I'll pass it on for all you =
Oulipian freaks (whoops!!) But seriously, although Tony's exercises and =
poems are not always "my cup of tea" he has some interesting ideas and =
was one (as well as Scott Hamilton) who apprised me of Perec etal. And =
he has wide interests including humour and so forth. Regards, Richard.

Yes, I was aware that Dave was quoting Glazier, and my remarks were directed
at the quote.  The issue of indeterminate language is aesthetic, I suppose.
But anyone who is versed in poststructuralist philosophy knows that all
language/writing is indeterminate, so the distinction in the quote fails to
hold.  That issue is problematic a to z.  Restricting "innovation" to that
which puts "indeterminacy" on a billboard is a political gesture.  And yes,
rather conservative considering the number of decades poets have been playing
at that game -- more than a century's worth.  Nothing wrong with that sort of
writing.  It just isn't very innovative anymore.  Best, Bill

        Hi Bill,

        I was reminded last night about my initial anger over what I
thought Loss had said. I agree that Loss is using the wrong phrase to
describe something neat about the format a text appears, but innovative
and non.innovative are obscuring words which hurt his message.
        And I most wholly agree that the poet will never out mode self
for all the reasons mentioned.

        Best, Geoffrey

Hi,

I'm looking for text suggestions, poetry and essay preferably, for my
Virginia Commonwealth University summer class, Writing from the Body.
The class applies somatic exercises toward writing for performance or the
page and will explore sound, rhythm, narrative, meaning and so forth.
Texts so far include Helene Cixous' NEWLY BORN WOMAN, Deborah Hay's MY
BODY, MY BUDDHIST, and my own UNCOMMON GRAMMAR CLOTH.

Thanks.

Hello all,

You're going to want to read today's NY Times for the
article on textarc.org, a site featuring software that
maps the content and structure of literary classics
such as Alice in Wonderland, turning a linear
narrative into an interactive map.

Associations between words and even the disposition of
the author's prose are revealed graphically a la the

I like the fact that Juliana is becoming an anti-nature poetry nature poet.
And Laura.  Everything carries a hell of a lot of freight here.  It's where
nature meets history and gets erased, or vice versa.

status quo. The point of poetry is to create a poetry that is a material
spokesmanship for their corpus.

To achieve universality, hide your subjectivity and
subvert the position of the monolinear

Final Statements:
the cultural status quo lies in the act of not engaging the materiality

the goal of digital poetry is a wealth of media and a poverty of of

One Last Bit of Advice:

try not to write or talk about your parents, except in interviews.

try to find words embedded in other words (an unexplored niche!)

try to hybridize your discourse by enlivening it with terms like TV and

we can only be sure of one thing: The truth is not attainable. As

we are what matters in the end.

Speaking of carrying freight!

I found this old Begly McCoy poem -- it was in his (her?) second collection
_Shining Beauty_ (believe that was a Bloodaxe title). I typed it in years
ago as part of a classroom exercise.  It really isn't very good, but
forceful and oddly relevant.  Plus, it's in tercets.



NATURE, BULLDOZER, LITERATURE

O tiny plant, yellow tractor, and text:
The first of you smooshed by the second,
but both encompassed by the third.

I seek the sower, the hard-hatted driver,
and the hard-bitten protester-poetaster,
so I might write about this vital trinity.

I will not speak of bulls without speaking also
of their dozers, for such would be unethical.
I will not name flowers without spiting their pots.

O plastic pot attempting to confine Nature's root,
let white congested capillaries crack you
by slow pressure of growth: unwanted boundary.

O mad machine, let weeds rise up around your rotors,
let rain embezzle oxides from your paint,
and vines enshroud your then rust-weakened frame.

O human poet attempting to confine this scene,
let it overpower your mad leaking pen,
O ethical imperialist, dogmatic doggerelist.

I'd rather read what flowers write of you some day,
their budding heads working around your inscribed stone,
their roots plowing through your small, undescribed room.

First, a complaint: why do the messages posted at the poetry discussion
group so often have the return addresses of the senders on them rather than

<POETICS@LISTSERV.ACSU.BUFFALO.EDU>

I keep replying to individual senders thinking I'm replying
to the group.

Okay, now my message, again.

> I am a naive person who will attempt to define language > poetry based on
actually reading it;

Good luck, Millie.  I find your definition interesting but
a little inconcise.  As a taxonomaniac, I've tried myself
to define language poetry.  I gave up trying to find a
definition that would cover everything that's been called
"language poetry" or that could distinguish it from many
poetries that have not been called that.  So I ordained
a special category called "xenolinguistic poetry" that
covers much of what is called "language poetry."  I
divide it into two subcategories: "infraverbal poetry"
(basically the creative misuse of spelling--usually at the
level of the word or smaller) and "sprungrammar poetry"
(creative misuse of parts of speech, word order, etc.),
which I consider where most of the best language poetry
occurs.  Many language poets mix these two categories, often with others,
but usually a language poem specializes in one technique strongly enough to
make its category easy to figure out.  As for abrupt switches of topic,
though, or whatever, I consider that something else: "jump-cut poetry," a
subcategory of "idiological poetry."  Pound/Eliot.

Subject:      nature poetry & other semantics questions
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hey everyone,

I just want to chime in about Juliana Spahr's comment. When I read it in
PPNL it wasn't recognizable to me. That is, she made some similar comments
at her reading at Small Press Traffic in San Francisco last fall, and these
comments did not seem as extreme as that quote looked on the pages of PPNL.
Rather, I thought they were quite thoughtful and as such tended to provoke
thought, questions, etc --- certainly no form of censorship for goodness
sake.

But while I'm online I must also point to something Spahr herself wrote in
the April/May PPNL. (& kudos to Ange Mlinko for editing such a conversation
stirrer). Towards the end of her essay, "Poetry in a Time of Crisis", Spahr
writes: "...the selfish privilege and imperialism of the United States and
the selfish violence of terrorism." My problem with this phrase is a matter
of word choices. I think it is very important to be careful here. The US's
privilege and imperialism are forms of violence, and giving them fancier
monikers does no service to understanding these complex situations.

Finally, I had a problem with David Perry's third paragraph (still in the
April/May PPNL) in which he writes: "...a postmodern nation of nature that
perversely naturalizes environmental degradation by way of cheap
deconstruction of 'nature' is surely worse than the traditional
romanticization of it." Briefly, this phrasing keeps us stuck in an abstract
(& alors, binaryish) notion that we and are actions are separate from
nature. Perhaps Perry went on to address this, but I stopped there.

And I'll stop here. Had been thinking on these things anyway as with
Marcella Durand I am planning an event/talk/etc about ecology and poetry for
next season at Small Press Traffic.

Cheerio,

Elizabeth Treadwell

Crimminy (anybody know the correct spelling of that word?) -- I'm coming in
a little late, but with a few thoughts and cents: =20

From the below post:

"It=92s this discourse and the political claims that he and you and others
>make, that I take offense to. If this discourse did not exist, I probably
>wouldn=92t be opening my mouth. One could simply judge a poem or artwork =
=AD
>digital, print-based or whatever =AD on its aesthetic and intellectual=
 merits
>(which is not exactly what I=92m advocating). But in order to justify or=
 sell
>the poetry and get into those institutional arenas that you mention, you
>need the discourse =AD perhaps not you in particular, but others who seem
>invested in a form of academic politics that parades as revolutionary
>(because it is supposedly technically innovative)."

Lumping together the act of discoursing (discussing? discorpsing?) with the
content of that discourse ("discourse and the political claims") and then
condemning both in one fell swipe -- ATS -- ("I take offense to") is -- I
believe -- an unfair and illogical attempt to silence a conversation that
is -- as all conversations are (including this one) -- productive.  That is
to say:  condemn whatever you don't like about what people are saying, but
leave their freedom to say it alone (with any luck I didn't just do what
I'm asking people not to do.)  Simplifying poetic (regardless of the
political camp it lights its fire in) discourse into something that merely
makes poetry something "value added" seems naive and short-sighted.  As
writers -- okay let me try again -- as human beings, we should be spending
a fair amount of time scratching the noggin and thinking "What the hell am
I doing and why?"  Which -- hopefully -- is the point of talking about
poetics.  In effect:  didn't one of them greek dudes say something about
some kind of life that -- in essence -- sucked?  So some people say some
silly things when they're trying to answer that question -- I once told a
cop at a CSN concert that I was "high as a kite" (he should've taken me in
for a cliched simile, but he just smiled.)  So I don't think it's at all
misguided or wrong to think about/write about the social revolutionary
aspects of contemporary poetry -- there is value in the process of
discussion.  Do some people bandwagon?  Of course.  Part of the reason I'm
saying all this is because I think it all relates back to the purpose of
poetry.  The purpose of poetry (oh shit -- did I really just say that?
here of all places?  fuggit, here we go.....) -- in my humble opinion -- is
to give some people (like us) who communicate best (perhaps not best, just
more comfortably) in this form we call poetry (again whichever camp it
pulls its wagon to) the chance to add something to "the conversation."
"The conversation" being the thing that goes on all the time in which we
(humans) try to answer the question/s that I referred to several lines
earlier.  An individual poem or collection or whatever is not an end that
reveals some truth, but a hypothesis that needs to be examined/explored in
a public arena.  So if that's the point of poetry, then any (and to be
honest I do mean any) discourse (whether it be about social revolution,
prosody, materialism, existentialism, blah blah blah -- even those guys
that said "no emotion without narrative") a poem produces is positive. =20

As far as innovation and "new poetries" (though I think I'm the first to
use that phrase in this present discussion despite the quotation marks) I
think Harryette Mullen is doing some cool shit (and by "cool shit" I mean
really good, exciting, inspiring, interesting,
make-your-mind-do-stuff-it-didn't-before stuff.)  If -- as some have
claimed -- langpo (and it's various descendents) is the attempt to show
poetically that language is arbitrary and meaning artificial (a reduction I
don't think is accurate, by the way), then I think Mullen is going a step
beyond that.  To me (and this is based on _S*peRM**K*T_ and _Muse & Drudge_
(I haven't read _Sleeping with the Dictionary_ yet)) Mullen is writing
poetry that, instead of stripping language of arbitrary meaning, loads
language up so heavily with meaning and in such unusual ways (though often
with usual words) that the words become almost unrecognizable, and in
becoming unrecognizable allow me to come to a new and different view of the
language that I didn't have when I started.  I think she does an incredible
job of compounding meanings so that multiple/simultaneous/equal readings
are possible in her poems.  When I say "readings" in the previous sentence
I don't mean "interpretations," I mean "readings."  I think, though, that
accomplishing something like what Mullen does has been the goal of poetry
for a very, very long time which leads to another point about innovation
and "the conversation."  I think Mullen's work is different and exciting
(some might call that innovative), but I recognize that she's a part of the
web with connections and inspirations that come from all over and lead to
all over.  So, can we be cautious about deriding/dismissing any (and I do
mean "any" again, even Leonard Nimoy's (I collect his poetry books actually
(anybody know if there are more than two? (I'd actually recommend them (I'm
sort of serious in a poke a hurt tooth kind of way (not in a I wear pointy
ears to bed and speak Klingon sort of way)))))) poetries/poetics and
instead try to figure out what we can learn from them and how we can make
use of their methods to further our own contributions to the conversation?
Anyway, those are my too sense.  I've been enjoying this discussion as I
usually do and I admire David Hess's (though I'm sure I could find a reason
to admire David Bromige as well (regardless of if either of them is
actually Matt Garite)) willingness to stick his neck where some would say
his sight should be and engage the aftermath.  G'night.

Interesting post----

Just two questions for now---

1) Are you saying the word "selfish" is a "fancier moniker"
     than the word "violence?" It seems that you are reacting to
     the word "selfish" here. How do you see the difference
     between "selfish" and "violence?" (this is one question)

2)  As for the assertion about the "romanticization" of nature---
     now I have not read the article either so don't know how
     the term is, er, "deployed" or "used" there, but it seems
     to that it doesn't necessarily imply that "we and our (sic)
     actions are separate from nature" insofar as some (if not all)
     "romantic" views do ground themselves in the idea of
     the self as nature, and vice versa...But maybe "romanticization"
     is the wrong word? Because it's too much like "idealization?"
     rather than say Shelley's "rendering and receiving."
     So do you think "romanticism" is what is meant by
     "traditional romanticization" is my question...

And, okay, one more---so what alternatives? What of
a so-called "primitive" polytheism, with gods and goddesses
named after rivers and trees, etc., represented, on one level,
as humans, of both sexes, arguing over whether men or women
enjoys sex more, etc? Is that "traditional romanticization" too?

Subject:      Kafka's Stomach, Kafka's Metamorphis
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding:  quoted-printable

A new story from the German paper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung=20


A Metabolical Metamorphosis
By Robert J=FCtte=20
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 2000

FRANKFURT. At the age of 24, Franz Kafka had obtained his doctoral =
degree in law and was preparing to join the Trieste-based insurance =
company Assicurazioni Generali. Following the instructions of his new =
employer, on Oct. 1, 1907, the young man underwent a medical =
examination. The company physician registered Kafka's state of health as =
"good" and noted that Kafka was a "frail but healthy man."=20

The several pages of the medical form also included the routine question =
of whether the subject had ever used "mineral waters for a drinking or =
bathing cure" or sought treatment in "climatic spas or health resorts." =
The answer was negative in both cases.


It is impossible to say whether Kafka concealed the truth, or whether =
the physician in charge felt an earlier stay at a sanatorium in Dresden =
was irrelevant. But Kafka scholars have long known that in the summer of =
1903, after his exhausting law exams, Kafka underwent two weeks of =
natural cures at the Weisser Hirsch sanatorium near Dresden to soothe =
his jangled nerves.=20


The time at the sanatorium had a lasting effect on the young Kafka, Anna =
Pouzarova, the family maid, recalled in her memoirs. After he returned =
from Dresden, she had to prepare once a week a cake concocted according =
to the recipe provided by Dr. Lahmann, the sanatorium's director.


Kafka had probably already become a vegetarian before a subsequent =
encounter with Dr. Lahmann's meat-free dietary methods in 1907. As the =
grandson of a kosher butcher, this made him a complete failure in his =
father's eyes, but he completely renounced eating meat nonetheless, =
"first for practical, later for moral reasons," as one biographer put =
it.


Kafka also tested another approach to food that was all the rage at the =
time: Fletcherism. An advertisement published in 1914 in the magazine =
Der Naturarzt extolled its virtues: "The method does not teach us what =
and how much to eat, but when and how to eat." The U.S. businessman =
Horace Fletcher published a bestselling book in 1910 detailing how =
attentive chewing had healed his ailments. He described himself as a =
physical wreck at the age of 40, having been given up by the medical =
establishment. Then he struck on the idea of eating only when he was =
really hungry and thoroughly chewing every bite -- up to 100 times.=20


Kafka apparently considered this form of self-healing an effective =
solution for his almost chronic stomach and digestive disorders. His =
emulation of the American model, however, disturbed the familial peace =
once again. In a letter to Felice Bauer dated Nov. 7, 1911, he wrote of =
the household's reaction to his Fletcherism: "My father had to hide =
behind the newspaper for months during dinner before he got used to it." =



Persistent digestive disorders moved Kafka to visit the well-known =
Erlenbach sanatorium on Lake Zurich in Switzerland in September 1909. =
Writing to his friend Max Brod, Kafka described daily sanatorium life: =
Aging Swiss ladies fought constipation and obesity and spent their days =
"applying cures like bathing, massage, gymnastics, etc. ... resting in =
preparation before the treatments, and then again afterward to recover =
from them."=20


The stay at Erlenbach seems to have alleviated his digestive disorder at =
least temporarily. A letter to Oskar Baum describes how one illness =
after another disappeared. But only a week after his return, digestive =
difficulties were again on his mind, as he noted in his diary: =
"Illustrator (Alfred) Kubin recommends Regulin as a laxative, a kind of =
pounded kelp that swells in the bowels and makes them vibrate, having a =
mechanical effect, in contrast to the noxious chemical effect of other =
laxatives, which just tear through the faeces, leaving them stuck to the =
sides of the intestines." Kafka obviously preferred natural remedies to =
conventional medication.


At almost the same time Kafka learned about Regulin, he came across a =
purveyor of natural methods by the name of Moritz Schnitzer while =
traveling on business in northern Bohemia. Schnitzer explained that all =
of Kafka's problems stemmed from poisons accumulating in the spine and =
warned that they could soon spread to his brain. Similar to antiquity's =
theory of humors, Schnitzer advised a diet that accelerated the =
expulsion of noxious substances from the body. He also recommended that =
Kafka subscribe to the journal he was publishing.


No one knows whether Kafka did subscribe, but he seems to have observed =
Schnitzer's therapeutic advice for a time, and the two were still in =
touch six years after their first meeting. Apparently Schnitzer, like so =
many other healers, exuded a charisma that Kafka, along with others, =
could not resist.


Kafka's most intensive experience with natural healing methods came in =
July 1912 during a three-week stay at the Jungborn resort in the Harz =
mountains. There he met Adolf Just, who along with Sebastian Kneipp was =
one of the era's best-known practitioners of natural healing techniques. =
Trained as a bookseller, he had been very delicate as a young man, and, =
after trying several cures including Priessnitz bodypacks and Kneipp =
water cures, concluded that healing a sick body required not only =
natural medicine, but also extensive exposure to nature.


"Light and fresh air," he wrote in his manifesto "Return to Nature!" in =
1896, "are the truly vital elements, especially for man, the most =
highly-evolved creature to call them home. Day and night, winter and =
summer, nature intended man to make his way naked through light and =
air."=20


This conviction prompted him and his friends to found a natural health =
resort in 1896, naming it Jungborn, or Fountain of Youth. The resort was =
spread over an extensive area dotted with "light-air cottages" intended =
only for sleeping. During the day, the patients were to stay =
out-of-doors and go about "taking in the light-and-air" -- meaning, =
strolling in the nude -- "and sunshine."=20


At the very start of his stay, Kafka was acquainted with the principles =
of healthy living by the sanatorium's medical director. Kafka's diary =
records what he was to do or stop doing: "Prohibits fruit, but notes =
that I need not adhere to it. Says I'm an educated man, should attend =
his lectures, also available in print, study the material, form an =
opinion and act accordingly. From yesterday's lecture: 'Even if the toes =
are completely crippled, pulling on one and breathing deeply will =
gradually straighten it.'"=20


Kafka praised the silence reigning in the light-and-airy cottages and =
liked to breathe the fresh scent of grass surrounding his hut. He was =
put off, however, by most patients' wearing few if any clothes, in =
keeping with the resort's goal. Many lay naked in the grass or capered =
au naturel through wood and meadow. More than once, Kafka was surprised =
and shocked when a nude guest appeared in front of his cottage or =
crossed his path between the haystacks.


Later documents prove that Kafka remained true to natural healing =
methods throughout his life. Only reluctantly did he give himself over =
to traditional medicine as his tuberculosis reached its final stages. If =
Kafka had had the choice, he undoubtedly would have consulted Ernst =
Schweninger, Bismarck's personal physician and a medical authority =
gifted in finding the golden mean. As Kafka noted: "He integrated =
conventional medicine and his own natural methods, a great man who had a =
tough time with Bismarck." Kafka would undoubtedly have proven equally =
challenging.Apr. 14, 2002

Elizabeth--

From your title and some later posts, I got the impression that you believe
this list comes from high school papers (kinda like the old Art Linklater
"Kids Say the Darndest Things" collections).  These "analogies and
metaphors" come from a regular feature in the Washington Post, the "Style
Invitational."  Chuck Smith, Joseph Romm, and several of the other names are
regular contributors, not high school students, and if any of the others
are, it would be coincidental.  Probably high school students (I have one in
my family) are smarter, wittier, and more hip about the absurdities of
everyday language than we give them credit for, but this wouldn't be
evidence of it.  I did enjoy reading the list, though; thanks for the
laughs.

Hi Dave,

Apologies for the unfortunate delay between posts. My web access is only
available on weekdays through my place of employment, meaning I didn't have
an opportunity to read your various posts until yesterday morning. Thanks
again for such an extensive, measured response. This has proven to be a
worthwhile exchange of views (from my perspective, at least), and I hope to
see it continue. My initial response to your "Poetry as Social Practice"
post is at least partially the result of my lack of familiarity with Loss
Pequeno Glazier's recent work (as well as the Spahr comment, "Nature is
immoral"). Nevertheless, I assume you would agree that Glazier and Spahr are
not the only authors whose work your post critiques. You've got bigger fish
to fry, correct? As you point out in your reply, you're not citing Glazier
and Spahr to condemn "them in particular." Instead, the statements in your
post reference a much larger body of work--a specific set of "discourse[s]
and political claims" regarding poetic production. It is once again this set
of discourses (or at least a number of the claims embodied by these
discourses) that I wish to defend. While a number of "slogans" in your post
may be ironic word-for-word quotes from Glazier, the bulk of your text still
clearly relies upon a tendency to exaggerate, simplify or distort the
ideology it seeks to critique. It does this in order to produce its
"humorous" effect. Readers derive pleasure from the incongruity between what
is said and what is meant. Complex theories are often either pushed to their
illogical (contradictory) extremes, or reduced to the simplest of
caricatures. (See for instance, "Individualism is anti-social. To look
within oneself is apolitical," or "We can only be sure of one thing: The
truth is not attainable. All meaning is commodified except the meaning of
this statement"). Which isn't to say such caricatures don't exist--I would
be the first to admit the ubiquity of "bastardized" theory (which, of
course, can sometimes be a good thing). But I feel that you present these
caricatures in a way that makes them too distant, too unfamiliar, too easy
to brush aside or laugh away. (Speaking of "felled traditions"...). This
simplifying, distorting tendency is often how a manifesto tends to operate,
and your post is clearly a manifesto of sorts. Or perhaps (more correctly),
an "inverted" manifesto, i.e. sloganeering by "other" means. Steven Mentor
describes the manifesto as a hybrid, a chimera, a boundary-confusing
technology. It combines and confuses (i.e. detournes) popular genres and
political discourses, borrowing from critical theory and advertising,
serving as would-be control system for the larger social technology it's
author hopes to manufacture. Most include original ideas, but their aim is
rather simulation, duplication, reproduction--they long to achieve the
status of a rhetorical handgun passed out to masses of (online) readers
rather than that of a judge's scales. They are monsters of discourse, their
de-monstrations reconstructing the audience (and their cultural landscape)
in a strange and monstrous light. Your slogans remind me of (not so much
aesthetic, but ideological) grotesques--monstrous, distorted representations
of the discourse you wish to oppose. By enacting your critique through a
series of ironic slogans instead of a rigorous, well-reasoned argument, your
post doubles back on itself, performing and becoming that which it attacks.
You present us with a manifesto that seeks to topple one regime of discourse
in order to replace it with another. So while you point out in your response
that you wish to return to a (constructed, imagined) moment before poetry
split into "confessionalist" and "materialist" modes, your original post
does little to signal or achieve such a return. You write that "the binary
division [I] make between 'productive' materiality and 'counter-productive'
emotion or sincerity" is not yours, but it certainly is the opposition
presented and maintained by your text. Either way, taking issue with the
formal merits of your "Poetry as Social Practice" post is not the point of
my email. Perhaps I should shift gears here and respond to a number of the
points you raise in your later posts. For instance, I found your discussion
of "de-centered writing and its failures" to be much more compelling than
the inverted slogans in your original post. It is true that I make an
unjustifiable leap from "fighting the confessionalist horde to fighting
capitalism and waging class struggle," and yet I think such a leap is
present at the moment not so much as a sign of personal faults, but of a
shared theoretical impasse. Closing the gap between current writing
practices and more effective forms of struggle is part of the work that
remains to be done. I also agree with you that extended divisions between
"confessionalist" and "materialist" modes, intellect and emotion, etc are
both undesirable and impossible to sustain. I am currently interested in
hearing about how you would define (or theorize, perhaps) terms like
"feeling" and "emotion." More importantly, what radical potential do you
locate in such terms? Are certain feelings (like anger, disgust, getting
"pissed off") more valuable or desirable than others (like sympathy,
self-pity, depression)? I read "feeling" and "emotion" to be bodily
expressions of desire, and desire is often the place where the demands of
capitalism are most viciously inscribed. You write that you "don't think
capitalism created the 'I,' emotions, selves, the ego, or the need to be
sincere." But surely you would agree that such categories have histories.
They are not autonomous, universal bodies, but are instead "effected" by
socio-economic factors (which at the current time would include capitalist
modes of production). You also write that "emotions never lie," but they
certainly betray themselves, and they are certainly not "ours" to "possess."
I am therefore hesitant to embrace such terms. Anyway, thanks again for an
interesting discussion.

Later on,
Matt

PS: No publications online or off, although I enjoyed your article in Jacket
#12, assuming you're the same David Hess.

 WORKSHOP
 Poetry as (Local) History

 (Alan Gilbert & Mark Nowak)

 This workshop will explore the interstices between
writing poetry and
writing (local) history. Workshop leaders Mark Nowak
and Alan Gilbert
will
discuss the writings of several poets whose work is
grounded in an
exploration of history (local, regional, etc.). In
addition to a
bibliography of "Poetry as (Local) History" for
further reading and
research, each participant will receive a copy of Xcp:
Cross Cultural
Poetics that includes writings on the workshop theme
by poet Fred Wah,
anthropologist Lila Abu-Lughod, Roger Sanjek's
fieldwork in Queens,
reviews
of Paul Metcalf's Collected Works, and more. The
workshop will conclude
with a discussion of participants current (or future)
projects in this
area
and various poetic approaches that might be employed
in their writing
of
(local) history as poetry.

Alan Gilbert's writings on poetry, art, and politics
have appeared in a
number of publications, including Afterimage, Boston
Review, and
Xcp:Cross-Cultural Poetics. Recent poems have appeared
in The Baffler
and
First Intensity. Mark Nowak, author of Revenants, is
editor of Xcp:
Cross-Cultural Poetics and co-editor (with Diane
Glancy) of Visit
Teepee
Town: Native Writings After the Detours. Sliding
Scale: $6/$8/$10

Hi Geoff.  I'm thinking of the Lost Generation whose working principle was
"anything goes."  So Stein and Hemingway, as radically different
methodologies, were nevertheless both innovative and communicating with each
other.  And they drank together.  Ha!  Ginsberg and Lamatia were likewise
wedded to different approaches, but promoted each other.  So I'm disheartened
at times by the attitudes of some:  "S/he works with narrative and lyric" or
"This stuff is inscrutable" so it's out.  Wrongheaded in my view.  There is
more than one way to innovate.  Some of us stress surfaces, some interiors.
We should appreciate each other since between all of us we're covering the
bases.  The goal, for me, is to do something that everyone else isn't doing,
or hasn't done for a while.  But that's just me.  Best, Bill

There are only a few things I remember about Hawai'i (spent a short amount
of time there...Dad grew up there, tho, & still goes back frequently)...one
of which is stories about the introduction of the mongoose (to, I think,
control snake problems...tho if I'm wrong on that, please correct me) to the
islands, & the resulting destruction that introduction had to the native
birds, etc...

"Sheesh" seems very dismissive and uncritical.  I think Laura's comment,
however it was intended, points to a real heroic undertaking on the part of
Juliana's "little flower poem."  The little flower poem that could!  Why
shouldn't little flower poems haul big freight?  Isn't that one of the tests
of poetic strength--the ability to stretch verbal/semantic sinews past a
reasonable limit?  For that matter, Blake's poem is itself an example of
such overcharged signifying duty.

More to the point, Juliana is demanding that even the most delicate
petal-soft lyric embody a social and historical awareness, in whatever way.
If her specificity about the particular progress of the passion flower
sounds ridiculous to some ears, that ridiculousness is an inversion of a
much more serious ridiculousness on the other extreme: that of pretending
isolated aesthetic expressions can be oblivious to the specific material
conditions of REALITY.  To brush this stance aside as "politically correct"
or whatever is just to affect glibly fashionable "incorrectness."

More power to flower poems!

The passion flower (passion fruit juice used in Hi-C!) is readily symbolic,
and this is part of its fascination -- it was used by missionaries to
illustrate Christianity (like the dogwood blossom and the sand dollar. the
undercurrent of meaning being that nature is imbued with particular
religious meanings) because of its number of petals, etc. and, we can see
now, by its behavior outside if its ecosystem.

Grows wild in my LA neighborhood on cyclone fencing, from no apparent soil,
all one subspecies, so probably originally from one vine in the
neighborhood.

Here, here!  I second Kasey--I think Juliana's
comments are a very timely and smart way to think
about nature poetry in light of the environmental
issues we know about now.  I feel like she's more
advocating for a new kind of nature poetry--one of
responsibility and context--rather than decrying
nature poetry overall.  And as she said, this all
comes from a true concern about nature, not a
dismissal of it.

I used to love ladybugs as a kid, and ever since they
have reminded me of my Ohio childhood, wandering
through sunflower fields, but lately my house has been
invaded by them, because apparently some kind of plant
which is not supposed to be in this country brought
with it a particularly persistent species of Asian
ladybug that comes into the house and doens't leave.
It's disturbing, both personally and politically.  And
any reference to ladybugs in a poem from here on out
will be forever affected by the
hybridization/globalization/suburban sprawl issues
this situation evokes.

Fantastic! That's good hermeneutical perspective.  We should have a ladybug
poem from Arielle.

I encountered the Asian strain this weekend in Iowa. They're orange and
slightly longer, and lurk in shadows.  My grandma laments their presence in
her home, but she doesn't swat them, just carries them outside on books or
junk mail or a pancake flipper or whatever's at hand.

I'd like to add to what Kasey has said by saying that for a poet, in a
process not so unlike the scientist's, the connections between nature and
poetry -- like all connections -- are both discovered and created. What  is
metaphor -- what is a poem -- but the linking of disparate images and ideas,
making unexpected, unpredictable, and we hope viable (perhaps powerful)
fusions. That chaos is at the heart of nature is not a shock to poets,
however, as it was, until recently, to scientists. The side of nature that
doesn't follow old "rules" -- the erratic, random, discontinuous side -- is
the side that seems to interest poets most. To coax out a description seems
to be one of one path of poetry's primary delights throughout the ages: that
framing of experience so that perception, even a fleeting one, gives the
illusion of sense, pattern...
something shaped. Been re-reading a lot of work along these lines lately:
Clare (journal writings on wildflowers), Goethe's "Metamorphosis of Plants",
etc., and am coming more and more to believe that annotations (poetry) are a
necessary feedback to nature's randomness and dissipation, yes.

journal
Shiny since 1986.  About Species, Publishers Weekly has written: "Wielding
the prose poem as if no other vehicle for wit and plotless storytelling
could possibly suffice, Friedman serves up sixty-eight rectilinear
versions
of soulful stasis (Beckett as upwardly mobile consumer, for example).... "
Rain Taxi writes, "Marked by smooth, sophisticated surfaces and wry,
tongue-in-cheek juxtapositions, Friedman's prose has an uncanny power to
startle.... Signifiers are constantly slipping out of gear; the resulting
change in tempo gives many of these poems a sharp, low-key frisson...."

"Sheesh" seems very dismissive and uncritical.

>>I think Laura's comment,
however it was intended, points to a real heroic undertaking on the part of
Juliana's "little flower poem."  The little flower poem that could!  Why
shouldn't little flower poems haul big freight?  Isn't that one of the tests
of poetic strength--the ability to stretch verbal/semantic sinews past a
reasonable limit?  For that matter, Blake's poem is itself an example of
such overcharged signifying duty.


More to the point, Juliana is demanding that even the most delicate
petal-soft lyric embody a social and historical awareness, in whatever way.
If her specificity about the particular progress of the passion flower
sounds ridiculous to some ears, that ridiculousness is an inversion of a
much more serious ridiculousness on the other extreme: that of pretending
isolated aesthetic expressions can be oblivious to the specific material
conditions of REALITY.  To brush this stance aside as "politically correct"
or whatever is just to affect glibly fashionable "incorrectness."

More power to flower poems!

  Kasey >>


   The overcharged signifying quality of Blake's poem was exactly what I had
in mind.  For at least 1000 years, flower poetry (and painting) in Western
culture has been put into the service of both ruling and rebeling
ideologies.  I have a strong distaste for poetry being consciously yoked to
the service of ideology.  I'm also perfectly aware, though, that that sort
of willful naivete leads to art which thinks it is enacting innocence and
actually is quietly putting itself into the service of some status quo.
Nevertheless, the distaste gets first -- and prose -- utterance.  A
declaration that any nature or anti-nature poem one writes will be put to
the service of religious, anti-religious, colonial, post-colonial, or
anti-colonial ideology just naturally raises my hackles, and out comes a
reflexive joke.   Such a project also strikes me as having its own kind of
naivete.  But then, whatever else Blake's poem may be (and isn't it
fabulously malleable?), it endures, it sticks in the mind, it retains power.
So if someone can write the equivalent of O passion flower thou art sick,
then the freight will get hauled.  I didn't say it was freight with no
value.

   As to Kasey's second point, I think in my personal naivete, I am going to
let myself cling to the belief that isolated aesthetic expressions,
oblivious of the specific material *political/ideological* conditions of
REALITY (scarier in caps?) are possible.   If nothing else, long after all
or nearly all the human carriers of a culture are gone, and the literature
is down to its wind-dried bones, a poem about a flower can wind up being
nearly as beautiful, amoral, and asignificant as nature itself (das bing
cherry an sich) is.  It's hard for me to imagine, for example, that a
classical Chinese civil servant could countenance my existence for any
number of racial, gender, political, and social reasons (and vice versa) but
what Li Po [Li Bai] or Tu Fu has to say about plum blossoms retains great
attraction and usefulness for me.

Jennifer, I'm interested by Spahr's
desire to see into the history of a particular as well
as to trace a interconnectedness which seems real to
me. (Did you look at her poem? I like the tangle
of syntax in repeated phrasings.) A mindfulness of
facts (cf her example of the "pretty" bush which is
choking the native foliage & was brought as part of a
human history of colonizing) seems to ground questions
of 'othering' in a political realm human and
more-than-human uneasily share...--and can't help sharing as
the area we are speaking of
is confined to representation (so the bush is seen from the
bulldozer, and the bird is already,
we might say, in hand in some ways). If only the
intentionalities didn't touch--but won't the reality
of the arctic wilderness be (in part) the damage we do
to it? It isn't so much about castigating the
bulldozer though--I certainly agree with you there!
How dull would that be in a poem (or even a letter to
a senator)?: what we want saved has to be established
or recognized as value, as worth saving (& so celebrated in its
unique existence, as you say). But the act of recognition
is complicated, politically....

Laura,

I concede that you didn't say it was freight with no value.  It was more
Bill's "sheesh" than your original remark that set me off.

Your question, in fact ("isn't that a lot of freight for one little flower
poem to haul?"), strikes me as a very useful one when treated as
non-rhetorical, which I assume to some extent you intended.  Maybe it _is_ a
lot of freight, in which case we can debate what exactly the limits of
flower-poem pulling-power are, and what the limits are in the other
direction (how little freight can the poem get away with hauling without
being a slacker?), and under what circumstances, and how this figures into
formal arrangement, etc. etc.

I agree that poems like Li Po's which have been subjected to the distancing
effects of history are very powerful, and even that they provide useful
models for contemporary practice.  As with everything else, the key for me
is context.  In the case of Li Po, there's a certain _absence_ of context
(or I'm _guessing_ there is--actually, I know diddly about Li Po other than
from a few Pound translations), which I think is responsible for a great
deal of the poem's effectiveness; it's as though a ghost were speaking about
flowers in a gone space so lost to historical recovery that it's almost
hyper-real.  The problem for me arises when contemporary poets try to
simulate that sense of timelessness purely for the sake of aesthetic
prettiness or "atmosphere."  I mean, we're talking about 1980's _Poetry
Magazine_ / ridiculed-by-Marjorie-Perloff / out-working-in-my-garden poetry
here, which, unfortunately, is still a very pervasive presence in today's
poetic culture.  As you say, it may be the case that "isolated aesthetic
expressions, oblivious of the specific material *political/ideological*
conditions of REALITY (scarier in caps?) are possible," but I don't think
they're possible when there is blatant REPRESSION (hmm, I think caps _are_
scarier) of such conditions going on in the poet's process of expression.  I
suspect part of Juliana's point is that to write pretty, harmless poems
about passion flowers in Hawaii, especially if you're an educated,
environmentally aware adult, requires a certain degree of denial and
_willful_ naivete.

There's another issue here, which I don't want to get into too far, since I
don't have time, but maybe I can just suggest where it might lead: when
Blake writes about a rose, there are all sorts of shared literary
conventions / allusions / mythopoeic associations in place that are part of
what used to make up a coherent poetic culture in the English tradition, so
that when a poet mentions a rose, h/she is also mentioning a whole bunch of
other things all wadded up in a big palimpsestic tissue.  I don't know if we
have anything that articulated and recognizeable in contemporary poetic
culture, which is of course both a good and a bad thing.  But my main point
here is that these days when someone writes a poem about a flower, it's more
likely to be exactly that: just about a flower, and not about a rich
symbolic web of parareferences.  This leaves the door open for rampant
self-indulgent aestheticism and decorative vacuity.  In the absence of that
old-school symbolic web, one logical alternative is for the poet to invoke
that reality we were talking about.  Or if not that reality, then
_something_ other than an idealized notion of art-for-art's-sake, for
heaven's sake.

OK, I really have to run now, [WARNING: SHAMELESS SELF-PROMOTION FOLLOWS]
because in a couple hours I'm off to read at New Langton Arts in SF with
Summi Kaipa for the Diaspora Poetics reading series at 8:00 tonight (tickets
$6; $4 for members, students, and seniors), but I think this is a very
interesting discussion.  Maybe I'll try my hand at that Blakean
passion-flower poem myself soon.

This is my first posting--I couldn't help chime in with all this talk about
nature poetry. I was surprised to find Spahr's comments dismissed.  It seems
to me that language poetry in particular might be invested in exploring not
simply the signifying "flower" but all the layers of meaning.  This
responsibility in nature poetry is it seems to me, long overdue.  I've often
wondered where Mary Oliver finds such pristine walks, for instance, and why
there was never any pressing danger in her work--over romanticized as it is.
Of course that's another problem altogether, but as Arielle points out in
her response below, a ladybug is not just a ladybug.
Cheers,
Sina

Sparring with and Listers.  Or one could take an extreme amoral or nihilist
position ( which I dont  but I could take it as an "experiment") and write a
great poem about how
marvelous/wondrous/horrific/ghastly/troubling/exhilirating was the
destruction of the Trade Towers (especially as I saw that
beautiful/horrifying event which would be as valid as your own poem (which I
admire a lot) which is based on the struggle between the wasp (ichenuenon)
and the tarantula..by the way the wasps: each variety seeks out a particular
species of tarantula or trapdoor spider: detail I picked up): so we can see
New York (or Pittsburgh or Penrose in Auckland NZ) as a part of nature: in
fact what thing is not?...one of the trouble with "nature poems" ( the gooey
gooey pretty pretty poems about flowers with allthe oohing and ahhing) as
against say Willams C Williams poems such as Spring and All is that they
arbitrarily divide flowers from plastic factories, Penrose (Industrial area
of Auckland) from eg Fiordland...but even in Wordsworth there is his poem
"of Westminster Bridge" re London and he was very aware of the "dark" sides
of nature.
  Wilimiams was no grovellor: he'd probably write a tough if humane poem
about nature and the complexities of S11 or the Israel situation: but as to
747 poets: recal its wuite possible for a millionnaire to sep off aplane,
stride up and down a few streets of the main city of Hawai in his immaculate
dark suit in the heat, and then retire (Rousell-like) to his hotel, and

Lewis Warsh on WriteNet...Lewis Warsh discusses ways of conceiving
subjectivity in poetry, breaking down the boundaries between prose and
lyric, the fragment, and singing at his Bar-Mitzvah.  Warsh also discusses
his latest book _The Origin of The World_, which is really a terrific

Ben---thanks for posting this.....


One thing I want to say about this discussion so far is---

there's this general implication that
NATURE POEMS ARE OKAY IF (BIG IF)
it's clear in the particular NATURE POEM in question
that the speaker's (or actually author's) attitude toward the NATURE described in the poem
is not, say, one of escape or transcendence, or spurious political neutrality....
all things I tend to agree with IN GENERAL a lot of the time.....
BUT that being said
I want to leave the possibility open for a poem
that focuses on the bird and not the bulldozer---
which is not necessarily irresponsible,
especially if the same writer has poem after poem
that focusses more on the "bulldozer" than the "bird"--
It's OKAY to not do this, no?
It may seem a jump to say this, but SOMETIMES (yes, Kasey, caps are more scarey!)
doesn't run risk BECOMING or MIMICKING the BULLDOZER one laments
by focussing on it and not the bird.
Sometimes, I say (because I tend to do this way more than not...).

There's a sense of CONSISTENCY OF POETICS here that I fear
is potentially debilitating....
Furthermore, there's also an assumption of SINGLE THEME as SINE QUA NON in this discussion
(I mean, in a lot of contemporary poetry, "nature" (so-called) may come more in the form of "lines"
than of "poems").....

Mongooses were brought in, not to control snakes, of which there are none
here, but to control rats.  As one animal is out during the day, and the
other at night, the twain did not meet, and they both became pests!

The poetics model for flowers in poems that I would
think would be at the tip of everyone's tongue, in a
Modernist/post-modern context, is Mallarme's:

"Je dis: une fleur.  Et, voila! l'absent de tous
bouquets."

"I say: a flower.  And, there it is! the one missing
from every bouquet."

The whole poetic linguistics of Mallarmean
referentiality and the tradition that flowed out of it
(which basically should include "materialist" or
abtract writing of the sort that predominates in this
List's ideologies) has been explicated around that
single fulcrum.

The idea, perhaps obviously, is that the poetic
invocation of a noun positions that noun within an ~in
vacuo~ context, where all its contingent details are
pared away and it exists for the imagination and for
semiotics in a kind of pure thing-in-itself-ness.  Its
the basis of poetic ~autonomy,~ which is also an
unnamed concern in this discussion.

Autonomy, of course, is that more ~Shelleyan~ poetic
universe where symbols, archetypes, or pure signs
operate without the laws of gravity, physics, or Law
that elsewhere hinder their activity under other,
standard verbal decorums.

What interests me about Juliana's politics, and what
seems like something of a latent contradiction to me,
is that exigencies of the "outside world" (the
historical eco-crimes of botany) are treated as
carrying a compelling enough (moral) weight to impinge
upon poetry's autonomy or radical freedom.  It
(perhaps dangerously) opens up poetry to a sort of
Judgment Day of The Signified, where every petal,
person, and place, logically, needs then to be
re-interrogated to nail its moral trespasses across
each poem.  It also (Juliana?) is treating the
flower's immorality as a sin in an ~absolute~
morality, no? where the wrongfulness of man's
transplanting species that a strong change of wind
current could equally have re-seeded (I am not arguing
in the particular here) is treated as self-evident.
And, perhaps stranger to me, is that it's
superimposing the ideal of a ~moral nature~ over a
force, nature, that some of the best poetry and
literature, to the contrary, has testified to be a
wild, ravenous, lethal and combative arena.  Think of
Robert Frost's spider which, on close reading, like
most of his derided nature poetry, is not so pretty
after all, but rather a close-up of a rapacious,
attacking, hungry zombie.

Where I wonder if there isn't a Spahr contradiction
---our attempts to gloss over the contradictions of
"capitalism" with newer, less-identifiable
contradictions--- is in the "285. ... 290. ... 295."
of the poem Juliana cites.  The essential lexical
autonomy of the poem as verbal construct is
conspicuously asserted through that line count, and
constitutes an ~amoral~ independence of poetic
language from outside pressures (unless, of course,
the numbering is read as the intrusion of the
exogenous nagging of editorial criticism impinging
upon the poem's chant),--- but then, once established,
that poetic independence must in turn be sacrificed
because of related historical knowledge.

Kant --- or Hegel? --- makes an early, touchstone
example of the distinction between aesthetics and
morality: we can say, "That cathedral is beautiful";
but to say "That cathedral is ~not~ beautiful because
of the back-breaking labor that went into its
building" is not an aesthetic judgment.

Where the line-numbering may be too infinitesimal an
example, I think other arbitrary selections from
Spahr's poetry, or any other "post-Language" writing,
should more clearly demonstrate this "contradiction."
From the PomPom poem, ~Analogy from Analogy,~ almost
every line, viz. "Analogy from analogy. / Analogy of
analogy":  The poetically autonomous lexical
differentiations between one pronoun and the next
("from"/"of") operate across that same ~amoral~ axis
of the poet's freedom; "Alaaiha, `e`ea, alawi, crow,
apapane, mudhen. / ... / Fly-catcher, turnstone, a`u,
a`o, plover, snipe": on the face of things, the
oeprative poetic agency is the difference between the
English and Hawaiian words, again a lexical and not a
moral movement (the Hawaiian, for the presumed
non-Hawaiian English speaker, enters in as a sort of
zaum, and its reiterated utterances ["A`o of the A'u.
... `E`ea from alaaiaha"] give off ululating,
seemingly lament-like vocalese.  In that approximation
of a sort of inadvertent glossolalia, the poetry
escapes even further from the Law that morality would
beckon poetry back into.

...Although these extrinsic, "real world" facts and
eco-atrocities are very, very important.  How strange,
though, that we might be finding ways of incorporating
the eco-atrocity back into poetry when it is (safely?)
removed at a distance from us, by time and history.
But our capacities are blocked at incorporating the
contemporary (when it enters in, with its consequent
descriptions and referentiality, it becomes bad
"Poetry Magazine" poetry and contemptible: and yet,
morality that carries any force is morality of the
moment, of the immediate, so that a different, "more
conservative" poetic language that confronts us with
the real and the current, to our distaste, is at least
re-encompassing us into a here and now where morality
might matter).  Is a moral laundry list of the past an
effective teaching device to educate into the reader
an awareness of ~botanical ethics~ that in turn might
be applied by the reader, the book once put aside, to
their surroundings?  Maybe.  Anachronism has often
been an effective device for confronting the audience
with moral examples they would reject in a more
confrontational presentation.

I do believe, though, that these two opposing currents
of necessary School of Buffalo poetic/lexical autonomy
and supra-verbal morality may be at cross-purposes
with each other.  One or the other will have to give
way, no?

It was 91 degrees in Central Park today in New York
City, April 15th.  Eco-ethics could not be more
urgent.  However, I doubt that the guardians of
flora's innocence will move into a similarly moral
poetry where every car driver, every mile per gas,
every traffic light, Stop sign and gas station, the
red Pegasus on the Texaco logo, are incriminated for
the abominations they are.

Every woman whose hairspray ever burned a hole in the
sky.  Ach!  Ach!

At last I can say that Lorine Niedecker's Collected Works will be available
in a week or two! The book arrives in the warehouse on April 24.


        "Lorine Niedecker proves a major poet of the 20th century, just as      Emily
Dickinson was for the 19th. Bleak indeed that both should have  been so
curiously overwritten and ignored, when their work defined the  time in
which they lived with such genius. Jenny Penberthy has provided         an
excellent text and a comprehensive, detailing introduction. Finally,    we
have the collected poems of that poet whom her peers thought the        very best
of their company. Now one can know why."

Yes. It sucks. Which makes it not unlike much of the work espoused in the
circles the film supposedly represents. Also, contrary to it's title, there
is very little poetry/spoken word used in the film, aside from the scene
where Saul Williams bursts into rap-tinged verse in the middle of the prison
courtyard which (and I hope I'm not giving too much away here) is the exact
moment the soon-to-be-laid off prison writer-in-residence (and, we later
find out, former drug addict) begins to fall in love with him. Not terribly
representative of the life of a writer-in-residence (other than, perhaps,
the laid-off part), in my experience, but perhaps I'm nitpicking.

My high school students, on the other hand, thought it was great. Several of
them also love Russell Simmons' Def Poetry. So you can imagine what my life
as a writer-in-residence is like.

This weeks Film will Be 'Slam' staring poet Saul Williams.  It is the
story
of a young man's journey through the prison system of Washington State
and
his use of slam poetry to resist the de-humanization that goes hand in

Ecological correctness? Oh yes!
And speaking of invading species, let's enlarge, as Don Rumsfeld likes to say, this problem. We should always remember that particular invading species proved most devastating to the ecology of this continent, and that's us, the white people. Thank you, Juliana, for reminding us. Whatever we read or write, we should always keep it in mind.

The rose is obsolete
but each petal ends in
an edge, the double facet
cementing the grooved
columns of air -- The edge
cuts without cutting

meets -- nothing -- renews
itself in metal or porcelain --

whither? It ends --

But if it ends
the start is begun
so that to engage roses
becomes a geometry --

Sharper, neater, more cutting
figured in majolica --
the broken plate
glazed with a rose

Somewhere the sense
makes copper roses
steel roses --

The rose carried the weight of love
but love is at an end -- of roses

It is at the edge of the
petal that love waits

Crisp, worked to defeat
laboredness -- fragile
plucked, moist, half-raised
cold, precise, touching

What

The place between the petal's
edge and the

From the petal's edge a line starts
that being of steel
infintely fine, infinitely
rigid penetrates
the Milky Way
without contact -- lifting
from it -- neither hanging
nor pushing

The fragility of the flower
unbruised
penetrates space

While I'm fulminating here, I ought to mention that Rae Armantrout is the
subject of a long and intelligent piece by Stephen Burt in the new Boston
Review

http://bostonreview.mit.edu/BR27.2/burt.html


Rae also has two poems in the issue. They're really great.

(You may read this missive twice -- I sent it about 5 days ago and got the
standard reply from the Listserv but it hasn't shown up yet, tho I've gotten
some 50-odd other messages from the list since then.)

Okay, I usually try to stay out of these things (though this has been an
interesting discussion, and there is a great deal more here that I could, &
may yet, add my thoughts on)--

But, Igor, I just can't let this one slide: "us, the white people."  I'm
sorry, what planet are you living on?  Or rather, in what century?

I don't think the issue in this case is "correctness," which is usually
characterized as a kind of dim group-think in which individual response is
shut down-- but precisely its opposite, the impulse to say, or do, what one
feels one should.  This is also, I think, apparently Julianna's motivation,
in that poem, though I haven't read it yet.  Personally I liked her
description of it, & I like the idea that a "little flower poem" could carry
that kind of "freight."  (By comparison with either that or the Kyger, which
Ben thankfully pointed to, another nature poem that's loaded with historical
& political context: "Passage" by Jack Collom-- much too long to quote
here).

However, to get back to the point of this post, please feel free not to
include me in your "us, the white people," whatever the color of my skin, or
yours, and however you may think that color relevant to an ecology which
will not differentiate, I'm sure, between homo sapiens white or brown, or
however uncareful with their words.

jennifer's dream of goodness

lacewings curled around each other in the doomed thicket.
they came to me and said, there is no competition; cut the cables.
the unseemly monotony of engines formed a distant phalanx.
already live-born young were the order of the day.
eggstrands transformed into protective grills.
poison occupied the tips of incessant life.
the contribution of the viruses was immense and not to be underestimated.
a second-order phalanx formed inside the mutated grills.
microscopic domains organized against the violence of the macro-world.
lacewing circulations, viral turbulence, across the sawgrass surface.
their stems bending slightly, sawgrass forests acquiesced to the power
of the thicket.
shudders went through skins of the mammalian order.
their live-born young died quickly of unknown contusions.
the phalanxes stilled among incessant life.
lacewings curled around each other in the order of the day.

I happened to stop in at the press yesterday
and was presented with one of the first copies

I am slowly getting back in touch with people

And take care and enjoy this wonderful

The EPC is now featuring two MP3 files of the complete New Wilderness
Audiographic release (c. 1976) of Hannah Weiner's three-voice performance
of The Clairvoyant Journal.

March 1974, with Sharon Mattlin and Margaret DeCoursey
http://epc.buffalo.edu/sound/weiner/HannahWeiner-ClairvoyantJnl-3-74.mp3 (25M)

April 1974, with Sharon Mattlin and Regina Beck
http://epc.buffalo.edu/sound/weiner/HannahWeiner-ClairvoyantJnl-4-74.mp3 (26M)

As these two MP3 files are quite large, you may prefer the streaming real
audio version at Factory School's audio archive:

http://www.factoryschool.org/content/poetry/bubbles.html

But if you want to make a CD of this performance -- the definitive
performances of the work -- this is the way to go.

Thanks to Joel Kuszai for making the dubs.

(Both the Real Audio and MP3 files have been made available with the
permission of the Estate of Hannah Weiner for noncommericial exchange and
listening.)

Mark. I can see what you're saying: but the truth is that the majority of
Americans, Australians, Canadians, and other ex colonial countries 9some now
republics) are now dominated (or the political economic power) iis inthe
hands of European people: in the US they are Wasps...I saw a docu on a day
with Monsieur Bushe and he had a lot of white Texans around him and one
(probably token ) black woman.....of course (by "us" to be fair or unfair to
Monsieur Satansky) is referred the majority.  You have to get used to
uncarefulness: sound s to me your're being to pedantic. However, it would be
truer to say the humans have in general destroyed: but they have also
enhanced and developed their environment.  One thinks of parks and gardens,
the development of domestic animals for food, and so on: even  certain
conceptual art works point to new possibilities: nature, we humans are also
nature, destroys and sterilises as much as it gives life.  Their are
"natural" forces more lethal, more detructive, cold, and productive of
sterility and horror, than anything Man can ape.  Richard.

Dear Dave & Jeffrey--

It is always good to breathe.
Watch the example of Rimbaud, Blake,
Artaud, Rukeyser, Cesaire, or  Vallejo.
This is "prelapsarian unity," right-o?

drama with the chilling fingers and maybe the Laocoon. The death that =
young men yearn for. They keep wandering. A hundred thousand died last =
week and things are everywhere.=20

And they flash or wink in a violent opposition of clangs, bangs, and =
clashes of shatter-light. All this and more: and still more, setting =
store and we are thus bereft to consider the clammy cells and the days =
of April: the days of yore when petrol pingle pangled out of Big Tree =
Cans until you fucked with various heads, fucker.=20

But all this is much more than it is. In fact it is much more than more =
than what it is. Much much more you whore. All this being more: I being =
you and you seeking me and us as we seek you and indeed ever shall into =
endless edges. The great sea turns white. And why shouldnt it?  Nothing =
is. And yet the Thing playing about his frontage had sleight. Some sort =
of lusty legerdemain. Les Main Sales. They are. It all started with: =
"You dirty boy." The house leaked like a palindrome; but never =
completely as if a savage and incomprehensible music (nationality or =
race unknown or irrelevant) was and did deep-guide her quick hand, and =
the subject of gluttony shifted, till one, flicking back a strand of =
hair, scraped back her chair and vanished by virtue of defaulted =
surprise. We linguists. I, by the way, am that to be and verify.

"Sheesh" seems very dismissive and uncritical.  I think Laura's comment,

shouldn't little flower poems haul big freight?  Isn't that one of the tests
of poetic strength--the ability to stretch verbal/semantic sinews past a
reasonable limit?  For that matter, Blake's poem is itself an example of
such overcharged signifying duty.

More to the point, Juliana is demanding that even the most delicate
petal-soft lyric embody a social and historical awareness, in whatever way.
If her specificity about the particular progress of the passion flower
sounds ridiculous to some ears, that ridiculousness is an inversion of a
much more serious ridiculousness on the other extreme: that of pretending
isolated aesthetic expressions can be oblivious to the specific material
conditions of REALITY.  To brush this stance aside as "politically correct"
or whatever is just to affect glibly fashionable "incorrectness."

More power to flower poems!

An overreaction to Sheesh, don't you think?  I'd hate to think that a poet
who finds herself in a pleasant environment, and is moved to express, might
hesitate, concerned over how to politicize the experience.  I was reacting
only to the accusation that the failure to do so is somehow immoral.  Can't
recall if that came from Laura, or Juliana.  Whomever, that's a sheesh if
there ever was one.  Best, Bill

Mark, I certainly understand your impulse not to be a part of "us, the white people," but it's pretty hard to argue with the facts: destruction of our biohabitat has been brought on by the forces unleashed by the Western civilization. If you think little green people had something to do with it, i am ready to discuss this possibility :-). Otherwise, you are picking on the form of my message, not its substance. And if the phrase "us, the white people" gets you going, obviously, "p.c." is very much a part of the picture. Your strong emotional reaction reveals that there is much to be discussed along these lines.

Best,
Igor S.

<<
Okay, I usually try to stay out of these things (though this has been an
interesting discussion, and there is a great deal more here that I could, &
may yet, add my thoughts on)--

But, Igor, I just can't let this one slide: "us, the white people."  I'm
sorry, what planet are you living on?  Or rather, in what century?

I don't think the issue in this case is "correctness," which is usually
characterized as a kind of dim group-think in which individual response is
shut down-- but precisely its opposite, the impulse to say, or do, what one
feels one should.  This is also, I think, apparently Julianna's motivation,
in that poem, though I haven't read it yet.  Personally I liked her
description of it, & I like the idea that a "little flower poem" could carry
that kind of "freight."  (By comparison with either that or the Kyger, which
Ben thankfully pointed to, another nature poem that's loaded with historical
& political context: "Passage" by Jack Collom-- much too long to quote
here).

However, to get back to the point of this post, please feel free not to
include me in your "us, the white people," whatever the color of my skin, or
yours, and however you may think that color relevant to an ecology which
will not differentiate, I'm sure, between homo sapiens white or brown, or
however uncareful with their words.

Thank you.  A little common sense here.  Of course it's all right to do this,
and one should be able to revel in nature's mysteries without feeling dirty.
Or is this immoral?  By the way, I was agreeing with another poster who
suggested that we might be asking a bit much from a little flower poem.
Interesting that post was ignored while several construction workers

I am looking for someone (or two people) to write essays for the forthcoming
Companion to 20th Century American Poetry (Facts on File, Inc., 2004).

Essays need to be written on, respectively: Poetry Translation (i.e., how
20th century American translation has played a role in the body of 20th
century American poetry), and Ron Loewinsohn. The Translation essay would be
2000 words, the Loewinsohn essay 500 words.

If you are interested in writing either or both of these essays then please
contact me; if I don't know you then please furnish some information about
yourself including your publishing history.

More about the Companion project can be learned by going to its website:

WORKSHOP
Poetry as (Local) History

(Alan Gilbert & Mark Nowak)
This workshop will explore the interstices between writing poetry and
writing (local) history. Workshop leaders Mark Nowak and Alan Gilbert will
discuss the writings of several poets whose work is grounded in an
exploration of history (local, regional, etc.). In addition to a
bibliography of "Poetry as (Local) History" for further reading and
research, each participant will receive a copy of Xcp: Cross Cultural
Poetics that includes writings on the workshop theme by poet Fred Wah,
anthropologist Lila Abu-Lughod, Roger Sanjek's fieldwork in
Queens, reviews of Paul Metcalf's Collected Works, and more. The workshop
will conclude with a discussion of participants current (or future)
projects in this area and various poetic approaches that might be employed
in their writing of (local) history as poetry.

Alan Gilbert's writings on poetry, art, and politics have appeared in a
number of publications, including Afterimage, Boston Review, and Xcp:
Cross-Cultural Poetics. Recent poems have appeared in The Baffler and First
Intensity. Mark Nowak, author of Revenants, is editor of Xcp:
Cross-Cultural
Poetics and co-editor (with Diane Glancy) of Visit Teepee Town: Native
Writings After the Detours.

Subject:      Aniversary Poem?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hello,

A friend of mine recently asked me to find him a poem that he could read
for his parents' 50th wedding aniversary since I am "the poet."  So I
figured I'd throw the question out to you all while I did some snooping
myself.

Needed:  One short to medium length poem that would be suitably celebratory
to read on the occasion of a fiftieth wedding aniversary.

Thanks to all in advance -- back channel, front channel, choose the channel
of your choice (rumblek@bellsouth.net)  I hope everyone else is getting
some springtime too.....

Ken

Yes, Ivan, I think I misread the tone of your post entirely.  Sorry for my
hasty blunder.  "Us, the white people" am the Big Reason the ecology & much
else is literally screwed: no argument there.  No argument, either, that we
are all included in that "us."  If there is much to be discussed, I'd say it
falls under the heading of what to do about it, or even how to begin talking
& thinking about what to do about it.  I stand by what I said about PC,
however wrong the context: it strikes me that one as easily avoids thinking
about these issues by hiding behind that ready term as one does in spouting
truisms, however well intended.  Maybe we both have something to learn.

Best,

Mark

OK, fair enough--about the overreaction, I mean.  A lot of freight to impose
on a little sheesh sound, I guess.  I still disagree, however, that a poet's
hesitation over how to politicize an impulse to express something
necessarily warrants a sheesh.  As to the suggestion that failure to do so
is necessarily immoral, well, then, we might be moving _closer_ toward
sheeshdom.  But even there, I think it's better to take moral opinions
seriously, at least when they are offered in a controlled and civilized
context of rational exchange, than simply to dismiss them with subverbal
scoffing noises.  Even--or especially--if you disagree with them.

Maybe I'm still overreacting.  Probably.  If it means anything, I was more
interested in raising the objection as a bridge to commenting on the topic
of nature poetry's role in contemporary practice than in scolding you or
anyone else, Bill.  But I can see how it came off that way.  I do think it's
important to maintain a friendly tone in these electronic contexts, lest
things start to resemble the PMLA "Forum."  So just for the record, I
respect your opinion, and I want everyone to respect everyone else's
opinion, and I just want Mom and Dad to stop _yelling_ at each other and for
everything to be the way it used to be!  Uh, where was I?

<<Yes, Ivan, I think I misread the tone of your post entirely. >>

Well, Ivan is not, frankly, my favorite nickname :-( , but if somebody is concerned about environment, I suggest they turn their attention to the key issue that can help unravel the web of problems surrounding its preservation and revival: Oil is the Black Plague of our times. Our reliance on fossil fuels (19th century technology) is at the heart of the current political/environmental crisis, and it will take good 20-30 years to switch gears toward cleaner 211st century technologies (if we realize it now, that is). I say the Arab countires will do us a favor if they cut our oil supply tomorrow, rather than a couple of years down the line. But they won't do it willingly, since they understand a neccessity of feeding our addiction, and need our $$$$. Drilling in Alaska and wasting a couple of pristine places left on this planet won't help anybody, though it will certainly prolong the crisis. Only when billion$, not million$, will pour into clean technologies research; when the 
 big oil companies will realize that the well is drying up, we are going to see some results. This success will:
a) weaken the u.s. interest in supporting theocratic/dictatorial regimes rich in oil around the world, and completely realign its foregn policy; as well as
b) stop a lion's share of the world's polluting emissions;
What do you think? i think that would be a good start. And alas, political or ecological correctness doesn't seem to be a part of this, or any other real solution.

Igor Satanovsky

actually though she had a painful death (in her early 20s) from tb i
think she didnt have such a terrible life.  she wrote her memoirs.
also, weren't the writings of st francis of assisi referred to as the
"little flowers of st francis"?

Hello All--One of these days I'd like to write something about the rather
odd reception history of George Oppen's poetry.  I'm especially struck by
the disparity between the fact that lots of people have
never heard of him, and the opposing fact that many of the people who do
know his work think he is not merely "good" but a major twentieth-century
poet.  Then there's the strange business of him winning the Pulitzer, but
not seeming to get much other "official" recognition.

Anyway, I'd be interested in hearing from poets who feel their work has
been influenced by Oppen's, and of course it would be helpful to hear how
people would characterize this influence.  If you're not one of these
poets yourself, but have suggestions about other candidates I'd love
to hear these as well.  And actually, any thoughts on the phenomenon of
his reception would be welcome.  If I do get to write something, I'd
certinly give appropriate credit.  I don't think I've come across much (if
anything at all) on this list about the publication of the handsome new
Collected Poems, but it seems an occasion worth marking.

Hi Chris and all --

Chris Stroffolino asked me:

Just two questions for now---

1) Are you saying the word "selfish" is a "fancier moniker"
     than the word "violence?" It seems that you are reacting to
     the word "selfish" here. How do you see the difference
     between "selfish" and "violence?" (this is one question)

Eliz: I think that yes selfishness can be a form of violence, but sometimes
this remains on a fairly abstract (tho still often hurtful, injurious) level
of consciousness, appearing within intimacy, more public human interaction,
various locales. So the difference is perhaps one of degree -- yes that's
what I'd say. But also, violence to me indicates physical harm as well, and
a decision to do that harm. Selfishness can appear more as an unconscious,
passive (tho still often hurtful, injurious) feature of an individual or
group. Well I could say more, this isn't meant to close off other meanings
of those two multisyllabics. I think that when Spahr wrote that phrase
"...the selfish privilege and imperialism of the United States and
the selfish violence of terrorism" she fell into a bit of the privelige and
imperialism she is indicting. I am not indicting her for that, I am quite
sure I fall into it as well; Spahr and I are both Americans. Bluntly my
sense of that phrase was like "well you are the gang and we are the police";
we might be just as bad as you but we have some sort of reason/sanction
behind us. Again, I do not mean to insult Ms. Spahr at all by writing this,
just to add in to the conversation.

2)  As for the assertion about the "romanticization" of nature---
     now I have not read the article either so don't know how
     the term is, er, "deployed" or "used" there, but it seems
     to that it doesn't necessarily imply that "we and our (sic)
     actions are separate from nature" insofar as some (if not all)
     "romantic" views do ground themselves in the idea of
     the self as nature, and vice versa...But maybe "romanticization"
     is the wrong word? Because it's too much like "idealization?"
     rather than say Shelley's "rendering and receiving."
     So do you think "romanticism" is what is meant by
     "traditional romanticization" is my question...

And, okay, one more---so what alternatives? What of
a so-called "primitive" polytheism, with gods and goddesses
named after rivers and trees, etc., represented, on one level,
as humans, of both sexes, arguing over whether men or women
enjoys sex more, etc? Is that "traditional romanticization" too?

Eliz: One answer is, I don't know. However, I will say that when Mr. Perry
wrote "...a postmodern nation of nature that
perversely naturalizes environmental degradation by way of cheap
deconstruction of 'nature' is surely worse than the traditional
romanticization of it"  -- or, rather, when I read it, I felt like he was
trying to include a really vast sense of ways of writing about nature, and I
find it actually a very tiny swathe, and one which limits the understanding
of nature poetry, the nature of us as writing beasts, etc, in a much more
profound way than did Spahr's "nature poetry is immoral" quote/thought that
he jumps off from.

I don't like or trust the word "primitive". This gets back to a comment I
made on list to Kasey M. a while back -- my sense of history and etc doesn't
preclude esoteric knowledge on the part of any group.

 Maria Damon:
actually though she had a painful death (in her early 20s) from tb i
think she didnt have such a terrible life.  she wrote her memoirs.
also, weren't the writings of st francis of assisi referred to as the
"little flowers of st francis"? >>

   I thought I remembered reading that she had some bone trouble as well --
arthritis or cancer?-- something that made her nearly immobile by the time
she was in her mid teens.  Again, as I recall, it was why all that patient,
diligent floor scrubbing (real life holystoning!) was such an act of
witness.

interesting too that a poet of slightly more
"mainstream" sensibility (and a lot more accepted by,
say, the "New Yorker" readership) like Louise Gluck is
such a deep fan--Oppen is the subject of not just one
but several of the essays in her book "Proofs and
Theories" that came out a couple of years ago.

She begins one essay like this:

"Within the discipline of criticism, nothing is more
difficult than praise. To speak of what you love--not
admire, not know to be good, not find reasonably
interesting, not feel briefly moved or charmed by--to
speak of such work is difficult because the natural
correlatives of awe and reverence are not verbal.

"I have been, for some time, trying to speak on spaper
of the work of George Oppen, with this overwhelming
impediment."

Hi neighbors,

I have some posts I need to catch up to, but I feel it is most urgent to
respond to David Baratier's last post entitled "Renatured Poetry" in which he
addresses (exiles?) me and Jeffrey Jullich in one fell swoop. Not only am I
taken aback by the greeting's disturbing coupling, I remain baffled by the
meaning implied in the subsequent body of text. Quite frankly, I am tired of
not comprehending SNIPPY intellectual comments. I *know* I might not be the
sharpest tool in the whorehouse or have the funnest vocabulary in the whole
wide world, but I do make an effort to understand and listen to others'
problems and questions. Not many people know I used the word "atavism" in a
poem when I was 18. I can't use that word anymore because it brings back
memories of Ativan (we had a painful breakup). A few years ago I wanted to
start a literary movement called Profanism -- I couldn't take any more of
that sacred this, sacred that, "everything is holy" Ginsbergian rap -- only
to realize that people would probably make fun of me by saying stuff like
"Oh, there goes Hess again with his Ibu-Profanism ha ha ha ha"....

Having lost my Hotmail account doesn't help either. I wonder if there was any
foul play involved. I've built up a lot of stress and anxiety as a result of
it so I need to send out a personal query. If anyone will be in the St. Louis
area from now until June 1 and would like to get together for some sex,
please contact me.

thanks for your time,
dave

Subject:      That Takes Ovaries!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Dear women and men who care about women,

There is a powerful new book out called _That Takes Ovaries! Bold
Females and Their Brazen Acts_, edited by Rivka Solomon, New York: Three
Rivers Press (an imprint of Random House), ISBN 0-609-80659-9. The book
is a collection of short true stories by women who committed gutsy deeds
that took, not balls, but ovaries.

Here are three excellent reasons to order this book immediately.

1. It will inspire you. I must warn you: some of the stories will make
you very sad. But you will also find hope. The stories come from women
of every class, ability/disability, age/lack thereof (one contributor
was five years old when she spoke up for the right to play dodgeball
with the boys), color/ethnicity, orientation, you name it. This is in no
way a male-bashing book; rather, it showcases courageous acts by women,
and there are quite beautiful moments that describe great support from men.

2. Editor Rivka Solomon is encouraging locally-organized open mikes
centered around _TTO!_ and other women's acts of boldness, and further
encouraging a portion of any monies collected at such events to be given
to Equality Now, www.equalitynow.org. Equality Now is a global
grass-roots organization that works to stop female genital mutilation
("female circumcision") and sex slavery.

3. There is a brief essay by me on pp. 48-49.

Check out Rivka's well-deserved smile next to her bio in the back
matter. This anthology was a huge labor of solidarity and love. Spread
the word, as Eve Ensler might say. Check out www.thattakesovaries.org.
It's worth your time.

All my best, and ovu later!

Gwyn

Hi Elizabeth----

Thanks for your careful responses.....
Since they are specifically taking up DP's and JS's points
more than mine, I won't attempt to respond by speaking for them....

The one thing I'd add is that I think we agree about "primitive"
which is why I put it in quotes.....
just to be clearer; I probably should have said "so-called primitive"
(or non-pejorative primitive)....

take care; I hope you get responses----

ok now for the record I'm about 2/3 through the book
and I really recommend it to everyone--it chooses not
to be exhaustive:

besides the introduction there are close readings of
two of the books from "singularities" and then two of
the books in "europe of trusts" (now re-released! plus
there's one at the strand for the budget shopper!) and
then a longer fourth chapter on iconography, etc. in
"eikon" and "non-conformist"--

it's fun and also very loving; the introductory
chapter is really fabulous and thought-provoking...

anyhow, I hope others will read the book.

I can't make sex in saint Louie (the concenpt is nice though), but agree
with what I think was the point ofyour complaint, that we are all supposed
to be sooooper intellllectual here and just in the same way everyone else is
and that we are lll supposed to look down on the same stuff, like poetry we
actually like reading, just that, because it's pleasant to read.  Just
bought two volumes that I enjoyed.  One was SKID by Dean Young, the other
was Wake by Bin Ramke.  Both of these are pretty "avant garde" in the sensse
that one's mother wouldn't like them and they probably mention body parts
and Gnosticism on the same page.  But neither is a fully blessed language
poet (Young comes close but only when he tries to be, which doesn't count.
Ramke writes his own kind of poem, the kind that quotes things on the safety
of beekeepers (written in 1899) at random times; *wear a veil" is part of
that advice, which has more resonance now than even when it was written.

I liked and reqd much of these books upon buying them.  Thus they generated
emotion in me.  The poems themselves, especiallay Ramke, had emotion.  It
isn't a poetic crime.  The weren't about flowers, I don't think, although
some came close, involving conversations had while lying in a field.

I have the same must-read emotions when I buy a volume of Bernstein (I love
With Strings, especially the poem which uses boldface so well, (usually a
poetic crime...)  Silliman is almost as much fun, and there are others.  But
like all of us, I couldn't evben understand Langpo if I had never read or
responded to anything else first!

Millie, full of bursting emotions, waiting to be stroked by emotional poetry
which will be meaninigfull and deep, and remind me of Sharon Olds and how my
dog raped my cat as I watched, transfixed, excited, superorgasmic, at age
seven...

i was a little and happy graduate student at nyu
studying (happily) with philip levine and sharon olds
when someone told me "you have to read the new jorie
graham book it's unbelievable how bad it sucks"

(that was swarm and it sort of blew my mind)

so then in one of the notes it mentioned that one of
the poems (Underneath 13) (my favorite actually) was
dedicated to Michael Palmer

so i was like: Michael Palmer? oh  he's that guy who
read at UB last year but i skipped the reading even
though he looked sort of CUTE in the posters...

so then I read "At Passages"--which *really* blew my
mind and I kept talking about it for just...days...and
this other student in the program said something like
"Oh you like Michael Palmer, you should read Fanny
Howe."

fanny howe? oh she's the one i always skip over in the
bookstore when i am looking for *Marie* Howe. she's
not the one with all the sentences dripping down the
page is she? no? ok. i'll try that.

oh well and that was me tumbling down, breaking my
crown, the other come tumbling after...

        Dear Laura,

        I have two orange cats that might be nice for a fine evening of
petting and scratching. They are cute and don't eat much. I love them
and you can't have them but if you come to Buffalo NY you can have some
time with them :-)

        Best, Geoffrey

That is generally true. But they could use a good 4th and 5th starter.

Hello all,

It seems any "serious" responses that any of you might have had to the
recent (and not-so-recent) posts by David Hess have never made it past the
SEND button.

This is not only an interesting and engaging topic, but one that, at least
to my mind, is extremely relevant to the current hegemonic "climate" that
involves us all in one way or another.

It seems to me that it's either being ignored or trivialized by many of the
responses thus far.

The tangential discussion of "Nature Poetry" has been quite a diversion, but
when do get back to the more difficult question(s) of ^Óconfessionalist^Ô
(emotional) VS. ^Ómaterialist^Ô (intellectual) modes, ETC.

Where has the prodigious Jeffrey Jullich been? Others? Gun-shy?

Best, Jeff

PS: "Who stole the soul?" -Public Enemy

Actually, I was thinking my post was playing
a bit on the "seriousness" of it all, Jester Cheff.  On the internet no=20

one knows you're a dog, In a poem, no=20
one knows your not.  I mean, what's a poet got=20
to do with poetry?  The poet, duh, confesses and materializes, but=20
who are you when you write inside the box?  It's an old question of where=
=20
the aye is -- but all this talk, well on the poetics list no=20
one knows you're a dog.

To Millie: Iâ^À^Ùm glad you are able to find contemporary writers that produce
emotion in you. Ever since I read that Popeâ^À^Ùs penis poem and the one about
the slugs (both from Satan Says, I think) Iâ^À^Ùve had trouble taking Olds
seriously. Bernstein and Silliman I find philosophically deficient.Their
thought is in their essays and not in the poems. The better language poets â^À^Ó
Watten, Perelman, Harryman, Armantrout â^À^Ó think with their language, which is
crucial since it gives the work its form, makes it â^À^Ürigorous.â^À^Ý I donâ^À^Ùt know
Ramke and Young except that I heard both read. My impression was that they
were both destined for Club Average.

To Jeff: Donâ^À^Ùt let those snippy comments bug you. Like you and Kasey Silem
Mohammad, I am shocked that an eminent scholar of Derrida such as Bill
Austin
would resort to the snippy comment. Would Derrida approve or disapprove of
such undialectical mutterings like â^À^Üsheesh?â^À^Ý Would he hold a seminar on it?
The undecidability is unbearable.

To Matt: Thanks again for still not being me. I read your response and will
respond again shortly. Hopefully, this will steer the discussion back to the
matter at hand â^À^Ó what exactly does â^À^Ümaterial practice,â^À^Ýâ^À^Ümaterialist
critiqueâ^À^Ý and similar terminology mean.

To Steve Shoemaker,

I like very much the sentence of Michael Davidson's introduction to his
recent edition of Oppen's poems that places the problem of Oppen's
reception within the answerability to life of Thirties formalism:
"Feeling that he could neither write poems in service to social causes nor
sequester those causes in hermetic formalism, he stopped writing
altogether for a twenty-five year period . . . ."  Even more interesting
is Davidson's putting this crisis within the context of George and Mary's
civil disobedience in rent-relief sit-ins (for one hears tales in Oppen's
case of more questionable acts of propaganda by the deed).  By whatever
measure we judge Oppen's political activities (I couldn't read Oppen
until after he died, Robert Duncan told Burton Hatlen -- paraphrasing
here, don't have the interview in front of me --, because he was a
Stalinist, and it was enough that we were speaking to each other!), his
work changed considerably in those twenty-five years, so the problem of
reception begins with his own later reading/reception/revision of his
earlier work.

The contemporary reception strikes me as pretty much as you'd expect -- I
don't find it all that odd.  Writers from nearly every conceivable
tradition revere his work (me too), but the scholarship is thin, and this
can be explained.  The contributions of Davidson and Rachel Blau DuPlessis
(esp. the letters) are enormous, but other than Gluck (who -- and this is
odd -- writes about his rhetoric, in comparison with Berryman, who Oppen
despised) and Taggart, I don't see a lot that's all that valuable, and
this is particularly disappointing when it comes from those (Kenner,
Pinsky, Olds, Hass) who knew him and might have made more hay of it.  Of
those who still dismiss him, we may take for instance the  sentence
or two laid down by William Logan in a recent (loony) Parnassus review of
the LOA 20th century anthology.

I see such a significant dismissal this way: Thirties formalism (in the
U.S. and elsewhere) develops an analysis of the productivity in poetic
language which hinges on the utopian cultural aspirations of pre-WWII
internationalism, politically, diplomatically, aesthetically.  Oppen felt
he had to recuperate that modernism during a moment when its failure was
unimpeachable.  To me his response is one of the glories of 20thC art. But
we haven't escaped the Cold War moment, as our Near-Eastern foreign policy
clearly shows.  I know that to hear this roses won't bloom from the ears
of postmodernists, but Duncan's remark still has currency: Oppen's work is
a response to his Stalinism, the New Left analysis of Stalinism is still
in crisis, the Bushees are still riding roughshod over the Left.  Let's
change our foreign policy and don't forget to read Oppen.

precipitantly,

i notice the conversation has moved on to eros, but just to meekly beg
apologies...

i think the problem here is just that my language was sloppy. somedays i
just need to beg for one's assumptions that i'm not really trying to be
reductive and hope you'll accept my get out of jail free card from the
close readings. although i guess it is good for me to learn how to say
things more clearly and part of writing is learning that. i did a
rewrite of this essay when i gave the talk again last month and i went
back and looked at the rewrite and noticed i had changed that sentence
to this: "Davies's language invites compassion as it calls attention to
selfishness: the selfishness of terrorism and the selfishness of bloody
retaliation." (i think gary sullivan is going to publish the rewrite at
readme at http://home.jps.net/~nada/ sometime soon.) anyway, i hope this
makes it clear, although i thought the essay as a whole did this, that i
am well aware that the u.s. is not at all innocent in any of this and do
not support most of the u.s. government's foreign policy.

michael Eigen on _Ecstasy_ and positive negative might be relevant here.

psychologically speaking there is a distinction between self-interest and
harming another.  I don't know about the psychoanalitic, philosophical,or
poetical ramifications of this but do know the failure to draw this
distinction leads to a lot of problems in the popular mind.

To Jeffrey and the list:  I've gotten some very thoughtful responses to my
post about Oppen's influence.  Most of these have been backchannel, and so
have my responses to the responses, and I guess I'm inclined to keep it
that way.  I am a little surprised that I haven't heard from *more*
people, and I'm especially surprised not to have heard from any women.
Oppen was in serious correspondence with quite a number of women poets
during his lifetime, the most well known example being Rachel Blau
DuPlessis, but also Levertov, Di Prima, and so on.  And, of course,
there's Mary, whose words were, of course, inextricably entangled with
George's, as George emphasized in his lovely dedication the New Directions
Collected Poems.  I'm grateful for the new Davidson-edited volume but I
have to say that the omission of this dedication strikes me as not just a
minor oversight but a serious flaw.

Three Poems by James Sallis

The Death of Virgil | The Death of Poetry | Artaud

James Sallis' most recent collection of poems, Sorrow's Kitchen, came out
from Michigan State UP in 2000. Black Night's Gonna Catch Me Here:
Selected Poems is due out from Salmon Publishing, County Clare, Ireland,
late this year, 2002. [There is no duplication between the two volumes.]
Other books include Chester Himes: A Life, named a notable book of the
year, 2001, by the New York Times, and Ghost of a Flea, his most recent
novel, 2001, that occasioned an essay for the Times' ongoing feature
"Writers on Writing."

Spread the word. Far and wide,

Dear Matt,

               Many thanks for your second response. As you know from readin=

to having come=20

writings. (Discourse with a big =E2=80=9CD=E2=80=9D seems to be to intellect=

what rationalism is to Reason.) I feel like you are afraid that I am going t=

Again, many of the =E2=80=98claims=E2=80=99 I frame in that piece are not ex=

condensations of ideological statements that I think are bullshit. You quote=
=20
two sequences from PSP that you see as mischaracterizations of (bastardized)=
=20
critical theory/discourse: =E2=80=9CIndividualism is anti-social. To look wi=

incompatible with collective action and vice versa, and spirituality is/must=

(since we can=E2=80=99t know for sure anything is true or not, nothing is) a=

of fake marxifying of that linguistic totalizer Derrida (well illustrated by=

               You are very right to see =E2=80=9CPoetry as Social Practice=
=E2=80=9D as a=20
species of manifesto, a form of discourse that you term =E2=80=9Cmonstrous=
=E2=80=9D (would=20
you say the same for =E2=80=9CThe Communist Manifesto=E2=80=9D?), and whose=20=
=E2=80=9Cslogans remind=20
[you] of (not so much aesthetic, but ideological) grotesques -- monstrous,=20

add that=20
=E2=80=9Cby enacting [my] critique through a series of ironic slogans instea=
d of a=20
rigorous, well-reasoned argument, [my] post doubles back on itself,=20
performing and becoming that which it attacks. [I] present us with a=20
manifesto that seeks to topple one regime of discourse in order to replace i=
t=20
with another.=E2=80=9D Isn=E2=80=99t this like accusing someone of not playi=
ng fair or not=20
coloring inside the lines? Why do I have to play by your rules and standards=
=20
of discourse? I am very willing to construct well-reasoned arguments but to=20
have to do this all the time is oppressive. Poetry shouldn=E2=80=99t be subj=
ect to=20
such rules and I see =E2=80=9CPoetry as Social Practice=E2=80=9D more in the=
 line of=20
monstrous =E2=80=9Cpoetic production=E2=80=9D than patient, =E2=80=9Csincere=
=E2=80=9D (yet unemotional)=20
argumentation. More Dada than Debord. Am I wrong to assume that you are not=20=
a=20
poet? I have no problem if you aren=E2=80=99t, it=E2=80=99s just so apparent=
 that you don=E2=80=99t=20

someone pushing an analysis they learned in a classroom. Not just language o=

discourse. What is killing us now is that a lot of poets and intellectuals=20
think they=E2=80=99re ROYALTY =E2=80=93 above something like the bare or=20=
=E2=80=9Craw=E2=80=9D (though not=20
melodramatic) sentiments conveyed in the above lyric. A poet gives voice to=20
many states of mind and forms of experience, not just ideology =E2=80=93 as=20=
if=20
becoming a poet were strictly a political choice (anyway, it would be the=20
wrong one if it were). A poet thus gives voice to the experience of being=20
alone, a solitary being in a destructive, atomizing society that has no use=20
for poets or poetry except as pedagogical or moral-training devices. I think=
=20
this rejection of the role of the solitary poet is a sublimation of our=20
desire for collective participation. No one wants to be lonely, but some of=20
us want to be alone, or unknown, to do our work as the now dead =E2=80=9Cwit=

=E2=80=9Civory tower.=E2=80=9D We need to stop equating the two.
               Your invitation to theorize =E2=80=9Cfeeling=E2=80=9D and=20=
=E2=80=9Cemotion=E2=80=9D is too=20
tall a task for me to take on right now. I do not see them as untainted or=20
uncoopted by capitalist ideologies or modes of production. I don=E2=80=99t t=
hink=20
there is any pure space from which to speak or think or feel. I will say tha=
t=20
the divide between =E2=80=9Cthinking=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cfeeling=E2=80=9D=20=
seems to be a particularly=20
American problem =E2=80=93 perhaps given our (occasionally healthy) suspicio=
n of=20
intellectuality and the lack of visible participation by poets in=20
institutions other than the university (I=E2=80=99m thinking of politics and=
=20
government), unlike in other countries. One place to start theorizing about=20
these questions is Marcuse=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CEros and Civilization=E2=80=
=9D -- an excellent=20
introduction to this historical conflict between intellect and emotion,=20
reason and sensuality, morality and freedom (or the =E2=80=9Cperformance pri=
nciple=E2=80=9D=20
and the =E2=80=9Cpleasure principle=E2=80=9D) =E2=80=93 and its Freudian int=
erpretation. As Marcuse=20
indicates, the goal of Eros is the overcoming of these divisions/separations=
=20
in the eradication of surplus-repression, domination, alienation, etc. That=
=E2=80=99s=20
about as much as I can say about it on this dreary Saturday night.=20
=20
My little conclusion:
=20
Any emotions are valid.
Any tools are valid.
It=E2=80=99s what you do with them that matters.
=20

good night,
dave

Language poetry is at once deep and humorous--deeply, often darkly,
humorous.

Language poetry is not for everyone.  They place Language poetry as a gender
and class.

Language poetry is not as explicitly multi-authored as web networks are, the
expressive power of multiple context remains one of its main concerns.

Language poetry is here understood as simply one of the functions that can
be.

Language poetry is not a secondary phenomenon: it has a special relation to
being and truth.

Language poetry is release (Gelassenheit).

Language poetry is good for you--a bit like eating healthy food.  Recap
points to consider....

Language poetry is a puppet-show, where riders of skyrockets and divers of
sea fathoms....

Language poetry is flowing. A philosopher is talking to you and yet you just
can not....

Language poetry is filled with this type language, but so is regular
language. The dog loved....

Language poetry is lost, but meaning may become more accessible.  Her
luminous watercolors, as ever....

Language poetry is above all a concentration of the power of language.

Language poetry is the only poetry that is language, but the term has long
been used.

Language poetry is the essence and the power of language.  I think all of us
are poets.

Language poetry is the best I've found anywhere on the web.  Know it, use
it, love it.

K. Interesting rhetoric, if the whole thing is not satirical,but else and
even, much to think of, and some good things which I liked (but overall not
very energising even as rhetoric which makes me suspicioned of your title to
this piece)..... but "language poetry":  - is there such a very
differentiated thing - there are poets who are much influenced by the
poetics of the language movement, and a lot of fascinating stuff has come
from them: but are they fundamentally in any sense at this stage at the
cutting edge so to speak: or greatly more illuminated illumined or
illuminating than any other groups or singles of poets?:  they are of no
interest if they are not, or "language poetry is"  (becomes "Language Poetry
Is"), or if there is the fond illusion that anything more extraordinary is
being done by them than a good poem by Robert Frost (someone mentioned his
"Design") I think for this type of poetry to move places or move me, other
people, it has to be energised by some emotional and hence intellectual or
conscious force. Or force of consiousness - I'm not urging a return to
Frostian or (say) Keatsian poetry though...When I was first introduced to
language poetry (or the language poetic movement) in 1992 Iwas fascinated by
the possiblities, still am, and I remember one student did a kind of thesis
that
Robert Creeley is a language poet: I was a bit skeptical of this at the
time, but  I'm not so now: at his best Creeley is a poet and a language poet
(but maybe he does write "Language Poetry" ( you are by implication
capitalising the form)) ... and I think a great poet who in some respects
has been "overlooked" (I mean that because of his very (generally) strict
short lines and his working with intense attentivenes to his craft he is not
put in with the "Language Poets") but he's, well in a sense arent all poets
langauge poets: its a questionof the degree of focus on language (or
self-reflexivness etc) ... your dicta could include many Modernist and pre
Modernist poets and poetics...but ok its strong (or is it?), and presumably
in earnest:
and as a kind of poem about poetics it is of course "allowed" to be
rhetorical even dicta tatorial...but some things start to niggle  - not an
Australian phenomenom? American only?, maybe: not "invented there perhaps,
but if a "movement is of any value it spreads: ideas go out and are re-used
by
others.. built into new ideas, just as the English language has built (and
probably many other languages)...however Languge Poetry as you have
presented it starts to sound like its a Closed Club - shut inside the US -
the country that seems at times to be going insane in its own
self-engrossement. A Club self-enclosed in a Closed Club: some of whose
tenets are openness? Suitable to the United States of Paranoia: Him Big
Strong Nukem Beside Himself With Black Laughter?
  Questions arise: what, in truth, has it contributed? Where is it all
headed? Is it all-headed? Is it a movement? The be all and end all? Passe or
just what the Poetical Doctor ordered?  The future or the past? So what it
is
"held to be one of the poetic modes" ..?  OK I know what you're saying.
These however are some questions that are irking at me: however I shall bow
out now and see what others say....but just prior: What exactly is the
"tyranny of meaning"? I presume thus a reference to those who always want
"transparancy" (granted that can be a worry) and also to essential
epistemelogical questions, but Dave Hess has already commented (in a
slightly different "take") on the "all Cretans are liars" problems arising
etc......but others have the floor now.

Dear membership,

I am looking for a few snazzy quotations from the famous on what makes a good
teacher (or good teaching) -- anyone from Plato's/Aristotle's end of the
timeline to the present.  Whatever help you can provide will be greatly
appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

I think everyone makes overstatements or slips of the tongue from time to
time. My personal definition of violence involves intense physical contact,
but violation (my own definition) can be more destructive than violence. My
personal notion of nature includes human being as part of it, not separate
from or superior to it. It seems the statement led to discussions with a
wider range of  implications than intended---displays of philosophical
muscle, so to speak.

A TEMPTATION FOR MISS JULIANA

Growing green spindrift down in the basement again,
all the cellar's floribund mould spores and Milady's
mildew, while simultaneously circumambulating the
ricketty widow's walk on Flora's feastday

on a house with no walls to hide unrepentent
scoundrels at their foul "-ower"-rhyme delectations of
hell-bound corruption (daisies), to be far from the
unnatural badnesses of a deceptive posey,

for a coy smile's bounty hunt to please the one
immaculate spikey macho plant that flourishes without
a ripened plant ovule

to recite into the southerly wind of perfumes a small
Hellenist's anthology but hygienic antiseptic palate
as spontaneous pollination from Maiden Earth revealing
the indecent harm a heartless germination did unto the
chessboards of black and red ant-hills --- ah! my
insect familiars on their Faustian backs, smothered by
a wanton bouquet! done in cartoon colors

and debauched in their page-turning to be saturated
hair all mussed in DEPRAVED literatures of an outer
envelope of petals and sepals, those orgiasts' naughty
forget-me-nots.  Ah! then a degenerate readership who
stain the clean, lily-clean frontispiece, a stem and
leaves to be dourly imprisoned rightfully in the
stench of greenhouse chained! by copying out a
commonplace book of horrific bloom

which blinders itself as an old mottled pack-mule in
rotten feed sack to the crime a floral pattern in
wall-paper all leafy so shamelessly rolls in a fenced
mud sty oinking all for rosey springtime that rogues'
Lent abstaining from bracing vinaigrette tonics for
their Pontius Pilate petals nailed to their corolla
and SHOWY without blushing Modestie nor a covering as
penitence for the downy pelt of up-in-your-face fl-ers
their gardens

My favorite defintition of a "Language Poet" comes from Ron Silliman:

"Anyone who has ever been accused of being one."

Dear Chris,

Here I am, Chris: Karen Kelley, the one after whom you
queried so desirously.

I am but making employment of this anonymous
jeffreyjullich@yahoo.com account,

as sometimes a lady may have recourse to britches.

What wish of yours may I fulfill, Chris?  Is it **O
poems** of mine you would like to PUBLISH in a
saddle-stapled print journal!!!?  Or a literary
criticism you might like to make of my enjoyable
versification?

No need for the "Back-Channel," Chris, as you so
euphemistically call it

(cha.no.yu [chah'no-yoo] : An ancient Japanese ritual
for the preparation, serving, and drinking of tea < J.
"hot water").

You may speak your heart's whims here in the open
forum amongst our peers (You have no scurrilous intent
to your query, then) as on a gingham picnic blanket in
the open air.

Karen Kelley

Thought you might like to know about this:

-- 3 new poetry CDs coming in May from Faux Press --


Wanda Phipps
ZITHER MOOD

Texts, audio poems, blues songs & film from Wanda Phipps.
Poetry and music in ZITHER MOOD are supplemented by skillful
collaborations
between Phipps and filmmaker Joel Schlemowitz. Phipps layers her lyrics
with
imagery from live description, memory and dreams, a "poetry you can
dance
to," according to Michael Rothenberg. Urbane and often sexy, ZITHER MOOD

cuts sly and playful deals between love and a hard place, textured with
honest miscommunications and deliberate mishearings. "Powerful works!"
--Andrei Codrescu


Edwin Torres
PLEASE

Text, audio poems, soundscapes, & video from Edwin Torres.
"I was in a room./The left wall was my friend./I turned." With these
lines,
we enter PLEASE -- a CD that uses the screen to navigate sublime
stagecraft
and lyrical realization. Bob Holman extols Torres' "text, graphics and
poesie concrete... the equivalent of Torres' fully-orchestrated live
performances." Torres' design background informs a minimal visual
architecture, combining paranoia with nomadic wonder. "Torres is the
inventor... the most optimistic, agile poet around." --Brenda Coultas


Peter Ganick
tend. field

Self-scrolling text & drawings by Peter Ganick.
"Never gratuitous," Johanna Drucker points to Ganick's "scrupulous
poetic
practice...to build the world out of essential words."  In tend. field
Ganick follows Phillipe Sollers' achievement composing a single
paragraph
that lasts the length of a novel, resulting in Ganick's wildest thought
experiment in over three decades of writing, lushly illustrated by the
author-turned-painter, illuminating what Ganick calls an "infinity in a
projection...a crowd in a process becoming its own projection." "Full of

provocative thought." --Jackson Mac Low


Each CD plays on a Mac or PC, and sells for 19.95. If you subscribe now,
you
get all 3 CDs at a special pre-release discount, just 35.00. (This offer
is
extended to Faux Press list members for a limited time; the subscription

price will increase once the CDs are released.) For more information
about
these CDs and details on how to subscribe online or by mail, try

Thanks.

in my mind 'philosopical muscle'  is how we got into today's muddle.

when you talk of violence you also need to be aware of the power of the
threat of violence.  women who have been abused often live the rest of their
lives in fear of it's recurrence and in America today we live conscously or
unconsciously in fear of terrorism even if we have cubscout Bush behind us.

make money fast


the narrow-gauge rails circled the entire asteroid.
without beginning or end, an equator was inscribed on the ragged surface.
ties were reinforced with titanium studs driven deep into the ground.
the circulation engine was constructed on site.
enormous rockets would push the engine fast in one direction.
heavy gears engaged the titanium studs and ties.
driven by heat, the gears pushed hard in the opposite direction.
the circulation engine resisted tremendous compression.
slowly the asteroid began to rotate against the force of the rockets.
sondheim noticed the gears beginning to saw away at the studs and ties.
the gears cracked and collapsed, welding the engine to the rails.
the rotation of the asteroid slowed to a halt.
the firing of the rockets now welded to the rails had the desired effect.
almost imperceptibly, the asteroid began to rotate in the opposite
direction.
visibly, it began to pick up speed.
soon a day emerged, an earth-year at a time.
the rockets kept up their furious pace as the day reached an earth-month
in length.
at the twenty-five hour mark, the rockets spent their last.
the asteroid greeted its new dusks and dawns as the track was dismantled.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The current issue of Boston Review is worth a look, not so much for Burt's
directionless essay on Armantrout, but for Calvin Bedient's review of seven
first books by, so it appears, Language-writing-influenced younger poets.

Burt's essay remains timorously on the level of poetics, explaining RA's
poems in terms of the cliches of academic discourse, a.k.a. Language
writing.  He does, in passing, make the apt and damaging connection between
RA and such writers as Rich and Glück.  But he does not exert much effort
in tackling the question of RA's artistry.  What is her special claim to
distinction?  Burt does not clearly tell us, nor does he even point to a
quotation and say, "See how good that is?"  The two RA poems in the issue
are weakened by bathos, humorlessness, and indifference to sound.  We read
them and think, "What's all the fuss about?"

Bedient, though, makes lively assertions about "soft" versus "hard"
experimentalism, the mannerisms and poses of contemporary disenchantment,
and the herd instinct among  poets to "dutifully raise Language writing's
'I have too much integrity to give way to lyricism' banner."  He is
especially sensitive to the opportunities and dilemmas faced today by
younger writers, including (in one instance) writers whose parents' speak a
different language.  Bedient's reviewing style is, as always, cloyingly
clever, but at least he quotes the passages he thinks are important.  And
he is unafraid to make generalizations about what is good and bad in the
current scene.

The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher
demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.
William Arthur Ward


The best teacher is the one who suggests rather than dogmatizes, and
inspires his listener with the wish to teach himself.
Edward Bulwer-Lytton

Experience is the worst teacher; it gives the test before presenting the
lesson.
Vernon Law

Experience is a hard teacher. She gives the test first and the lessons
afterwards.
Anonymous

Experience is a dear teacher, but fools will learn at no other.
Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790)

A teacher is one who makes himself progressively unnecessary.
Thomas Carruthers

A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell, where his influence stops.
Henry Brooks Adams


Children today are tyrants. They contradict their parent, gobble their food,
and tyrannize their teachers.
Socrates (470-399 B.C.)

Time is a great teacher, but unfortunately it kills all its pupils.
Hector Louis Berlioz

The whole art of teaching is only the art of awakening the natural curiosity
of young minds for the purpose of satisfying it afterwards.
Anatole France

Teaching is not a lost art, but the regard for it is a lost tradition.
Jacques Barzun

It is because modern education is so seldom inspired by a great hope that it
so seldom achieves great results. The wish to preserve the past rather that
the hope of creating the future dominates the minds of those who control the
teaching of the young.
Bertrand Russell (1872-1970)

Good teaching is one-fourth preparation and three-fourths theater.
Gail Godwin

We spend the first twelve months of our children's lives teaching them to
walk and talk and the next twelve telling them to sit down and shut up.
Phyllis Diller

Dear List,

The other day Richard Tylr posed a question I hardly ever get asked: Am I
related to Rudolf Hess, Hitler's right hand man? I thought of letting this
go, because it seems to have been asked in jest (as if humor could ever be
evoked by such a reference). Nonetheless I feel like I must clear my name and
reassure people that no relatives of mine were Nazis and no ancestors came
over in U-boats.

The word "fascist" is used a lot in literary circles to describe people with
extreme opinions. I would like to see an end to this particular kind of easy
name-calling.

thanks,
dave

P.S.: I know some of you think I look German but you're wrong. I LOOK SWISS!

Hi again,

Last year the kind folks at Skanky Possum Press put together a chapbook of
ten 'early' poems called Cage Dances. It's not available through the
publisher or SPD, so I'm making this offer: 10 free copies in exchange for
something, a book or some poems, doesn't matter really. Otherwise, I''ll be
making xeroxes for anyone who wants one. I hope that makes sense.

Give me your full name and address if you write me,
dave

THE LEGION OF DOOM
Greatest Super-Villains Of All Time!




Superman speaks as the last survivor of the planet Earth
and tells of the incredible disaster unleashed by the Legion of Doom.



its times like these when no one seems to care
that pride in ones work comes at a price.
when all spectacle comes force upon blade
crank shaft over a slide rule, Intel over ADM

thirteen villains gathered together, the Hall of Doom
representing the ultimate arch-enemies; a foil of form

in order to destroy/ or /rule the world, the last will be first
and the thirteen will ride dark animators glory sky


                                when you first see
                                a horse it is frightening

a tiger swooping
                                a gentle cats sleep

but it is the man on top that call the eye upwards
        to the sword or pistol on his side, a wool blanket

at the time of death what thoughts will swirl in my head
when energy departs for new horizons;
what thoughts will remain

to challenge the combined strength of the Super Friends
Lex Luthor founded this Legion of Doom

if one falls against many
                                many against many

on that day

many will fall
                                one will be won, held
by the ones left standing





There is no telling what the evil mind can accomplish

In a murky swamp
Grodd the gorilla is frustrated
by insipid plans for global conquest


Luthor silences him for Captain Cold
has recently been in contact with an advanced civilization
from the planet of Venus

The feminine yet ferocious Giganta is unimpressed
but Bizarro calmly claims he can make it not work.

Or rather 'to work'
Luthor amends

Sinestro and Bizarro will fly to the Moon
   using an atomic laser they cut it in half
to retrieve the Robalt element deep within its core

The astronauts of Moon Base One will be thrown into deep space and the
debris will disrupt the solar flows and crash the Earth into the Sun

The Toyman will lure the Green Lantern to his planet of toys,
with well placed traps placing false distress calls

sending the Super friends on a wild goose chase that will end them right out
of the Universe


As The Legion of Doom
their ingenious plan goes into action


After repairing the NASA space station on the far side of the moon and
wishing its astronauts well

Hawkman, Green Lantern and The Dynamic Duo
in the Hawk Plane fly for home

They hear Superman's distress call,
which is actually a Toyman trick,
head off to find what happened

Earth.


Frigid Captain Cold
sets out with his giant freezing ray, blue spun butter
freezing Washington D.C., San Francisco, New York.

Aquaman arrives to the scene of destruction
to find the sinister, humorous Riddler

        [A question mark looms on the high seas]

only to be subdued by with the Noxium crystal.  Luthor and the others then
plan their next target, Wonder Woman.

The cunning Cheetah tries to break into the Metropolis Electrical Plant and
fools Wonder Woman into harnessing a robot rocket with her Magic Lasso.

        We do not see her again


In Washington D.C the super intelligent android Brainiac

duplicates all of the world leaders,
replacing their forms with robotics

and their plan to conquest the Earth is almost set.


Black Manta and the hideous Scarecrow ends their plans
beaming the mental matter ray straight

through to all of the worlds peoples
through to all of the worlds television sets

They slip into the universe of Qward and leave behind three antimatter
robots as a trap that will destroy the Super Friends once they are touched.

Chief O'Hara informs them that Grodd and Solomon Grundy are attempting to
break into the Gotham City Treasury.

Superman and Black Vulcan
race to intercept them.
Luthor's mind control paralyzes them.


The Legion of Doom streak on their deadly course to worldwide conquest


                        ...



A spaceship lands and three aliens emerge wondering what happened.

The Earth in shambles,
black crustings of life
nothing moves in silence; no one is alive

END OF WORLD NEAR - SUPER FRIENDS NO HELP!!".

no one is alive and nothing moves in silence

The aliens see the people of Earth never understood
that the use of force over force to solve problems
always brings not only chaos but ripples in space and time.

they decided it is in the universes best interest
to give the Earth life once more
a second chance at life and undo




and turn back time to before the disaster.
to relive their disasters
only with bit of help from new friends.


The Legion of Doom
tries to battle

rivals spin in orbits

but are soon rounded up
with the help of the mental matter ray.

The Legion of Doom
will never break away from justice or the Super Friends.

when you first see
                                a horse it is frightening


                            Best, Geoffrey

"To teach is not to transfer knowledge but to create the possibility for the
production or construction of knowledge."

"To transform the experience of educating into a matter of simple technique
is to impoverish what is fundamentally human in this experience: namely, its
capacity to form the human person. If we have any regard for what it means
to be human, the teaching of contents cannot be separated from the moral
formation of the learners."

Dave. As you know I was reminiscing with some old school chums and we'd
imbibed more than the usual brandies...actually I find Rudolf Hess quite an
interesting character: I dont see why we cant make humour about anything.  I
think that's half the trouble in Israel: the Israealis hark back endlessly
to their holocaust (the poor me syndrome) while they hammer the hell out of
the Palestinians in a land they stole of using Nazi methods: and nowadays
Israel is basically the stooge of the US receiving I belkieve about US$5
billion to keep up the shit stirrring over there. Dont get worked up over a
name while that shits going down. Richard.

I find the crack about the Holocaust hurtful.  And, I'm not a
Zionist.  It's historically accurate to separate the Holocaust and its
horror from the disaster of Zionism.  More properly, the Holocaust can only
really be a holocaust.  There have been many, affecting different peoples;
e.g., African slave trade, American slave system, treatment of American
Indians or Australian aboriginal people, massacre of Armenians etc.

On the question of humor, I don't find fun in what people cannot change
such as race, gender, physical disability.  And why should they change
surnames either?

Hi

i want to make of those apologies in advance in respect of cross-posting.

things not worth keeping are proud to announce:

=8CThe Books=B9, the first in a planned series of 10 (subscription only)
publications over the next two-three years.

Chapter 1 : The Gathering

Every chapter in the series will be produced in the same square format (20c=
m
x 20cm) and in full colour throughout -  24pp featuring 10 composed
double-page spreads building towards a 240pp full-colour artwork. The serie=
s
presents a continuous narrative that weaves documentation and fiction into =
a
radical version, not a conclusion, of =8CThe Books=B9 project. We=B9re working
with the conversations we like to imagine between artists=B9 books, graphic
novels/poems and contemporary poetics.

We=B9ve been working with this material since the autumn of 1998 - through a
number of installation, performance and web based occurrences, some of whic=
h
you may have already heard about, witnessed or even participated in. More
details are online at www.thingsnotworthkeeping.com. The work explores and
makes explicit ideas about collaboration.

We have just begun a targetted mail-out of the free launch issue intended t=
o
generate subscribers and sponsors for the rest of the series. We have a
number of blank envelopes remaining.

IF you would like to receive the invite package - including the free first
issue  -  and IF you are a series candidate to become an individual or
institutional subscriber / sponsor (the rates are not at all prohibitive :
=A340 with a =A330 concessionary rate for all 10 books, separate rates for
sponsors and institutions) then b/c us your address and we'll get them in
the post this week. We're stressing this indication of serious intent as
they are expensive to produce and we're not able to give away endless
freebies. I might add that 'the books' will not be available for separate
purchase.=20

looking forward

cris cheek and kirsten lavers (on behalf of things not worth keeping)

It wasnt a crack. I was serious. But not about Dave being related to Rudolf
Hess. I've always been interested in the "Hess incident" though, and it
seems that Hess had the idea that the British would listen to him: now that
has always seemed to me to be almost heroic, if bizarre...I dont know much
about Rudolf Hess: like all the Nazis he seems a rather pathetic figure. But
maybe he thought that he could obviate some of the more  terrible aspects: I
dont know why they arrested a man whoseemed to be defecting to their side:
but then I dont know much about that incident.
  I se parallels between the Isarelis and the Nazis. I se a link: in a sense
the present vilence may be 'caused" by that holocaust. But its time for
negotiation: for the UN to step in and try Sharon and Bush as war criminals.
Richard.

Hi Tom

I understand the threat of violence. At the risk of sounding like 1962
Norman Mailer, I would also say that the threat of violence, while being a
component of violence, is more properly defined as terror. Part of my former
job involved funding battered women's shelters. Part of my former job
involved visiting social programs located in neighborhoods where, with
uncanny coincidence, a drive-by shooting had occurred the night before. I
knew risk and terror before 9/11. But pursuing this discussion leads to yet
another digression. Valid as the subject may be, I don't wish to pursue it.
The point I was making was that the discussion of nature poetry in general
had wandered too far afield, and had less and less to do with Spahr's
original comments.

Vernon

is the highest form of language. Brodsky
sees it also as the highest form
in their attitude to those like Bob
Perelman, who have moved within. Language poetry

is concerned, then, with what it is to be
radical in theory, practice and

is also often seen as elitist because it never

Hi, all.

I'm hoping you can help me with yet another query.
I'm planning to teach a lit class next fall focusing
on contemporary fiction, poetry and hybrid stuff by
very young writers--I would prefer as many of them to
be under 30 as possible.  This is for a class of
students who won't have read much lit at all in their
lives, and who tend to see lit as something
intimidating and alien, so this work should be fun and
relatively accessible but also edgy and challenging.
Hopefully the work will bring up pop culture
references, sex and drug content and other things my
students will be surprised to find in literature.  And
I definitely want to include writers of color, queer
writers, etc.

So, any suggestions--short novels, short stories,
poetry books, anthologies, etc.--please backchannel.

Much obliged,
Arielle

PS  Thanks for the recent postings of Language Po
defintions--very useful!  The Flashpoint stuff was
great!

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding:  7bit

Sorry, but I couldn't resist. . .

WHAt IS Terrorism?


Terrorism is a certain kind or quality of intellectuality, or seeming
intellectuality. Terrorism is a form of expression that allows our deepest
soul to be portrayed to others. Terrorism is a message ... a language of the
old and the young.  The language of the weak and the strong.  The language of
patriots. Terrorism is a movement of convincing authority in contemporary
terror. Terrorism is a particularly American phenomenon that borrows from
European traditions and theories. Terrorism is a particularly regular and
effective tool for learning.  Topics are rich. Terrorism is a perfect way to
describe the blurred understanding of dreams. Terrorism is a performance art
form involving signing rhythm and movement. Terrorism is a puppet-show, where
riders of skyrockets and divers of sea fathoms.... Terrorism is a
recuperation by "literature" of something that was questioning the poetic.
Terrorism is a self-defeating fiction. Terrorism is a special type of
language that attempts to express the inexpressible.  It is not the
pragmatic. Terrorism is a technology for memory and speed. Terrorism is a
term I prefer not to use. Terrorism is a transcendence of logical
confinement.  A wonderful wine poured into a bottle. Terrorism is a type of
speech.  Second, song lyrics are stolen back from the dull. Terrorism is a
very high form of linguistic intelligence. Terrorism is a way of expression
open to anyone who chooses to use it. Terrorism is a way to make sense of the
world.  I never really know what I think. Terrorism is a way to say something
in a way that shows love and elevates that. Terrorism is about going beyond
the boundaries of traditional / conventional language usage. Terrorism is
about making language happen. Terrorism is about memory and shared
experiences. Terrorism is about moving an audience with sound and image.
Terrorism is above all a concentration of the power of language. Terrorism is
academy-ready.  The founders were interested in ideas. Terrorism is also
better than prose at shaping small subjects to create intimate feeling.
Terrorism is also fundamental because it speaks to the right content through
language.  What.... Terrorism is also included but difficult to write.
Terrorism is also often seen as elitist because it never dealt adequately
with issues. Terrorism is also provided. Terrorism is always the one you can
feel more intensively. Terrorism is an American phenomenon, not an Australian
one.  Explore its possibilities. Terrorism is an art form that places a very
high value on rhythm, rhyme, alliteration. Terrorism is an art, and it is
common for artists to disagree. Terrorism is an echo asking a shadow dancer
to be a partner. Terrorism is an experience of referral in the place of
transparent signification. Terrorism is artistic noise: it resists the dreams
of pure communication. Terrorism is at once deep and humorous--deeply, often
darkly, humorous. Terrorism is autobiographical at its fundament, even if an
attempt to purge self. Terrorism is available in English, for example, but it
doesn't have the same value. Terrorism is being explored and we are looking
at the many techniques. Terrorism is best served when it attacks not language
itself (give me a good clause). Terrorism is blessed by many. Terrorism is
both concise and precise, two of the most important elements. Terrorism is
built of nothing but words, and must use what it finds to hand. Terrorism is
by no means a toy in the hands of foreign rulers. Terrorism is central to
existence, to the real lives of real people. Terrorism is concerned, then,
with what it is to be radical in theory. Terrorism is considered centripetal
because the author tries to infuse every word. Terrorism is constructed as a
niche market. Terrorism is correlative to no object, including its own
notion. Terrorism is diverse, including a selection by women. Terrorism is
especially powerful.  I think the best way to understand Terrorism is
essentially rhythmic and usually metrical, and it is frequently structured in
stanzas. Terrorism is filled with this type language, but so is regular
language. The dog loved it. Terrorism is first of all speaking with
listening? a peculiar state that is somehow self. Terrorism is flowing. A
philosopher is talking to you and yet you just can not.... Terrorism is good
for you--a bit like eating healthy food.  Recap points to consider....
Terrorism is held out to be one of the modes of the present moment. Terrorism
is here understood as simply one of the functions that can be. Terrorism is
here, alive and blooming, but with a pop-culture injection of speed.
Terrorism is highly personal, intellectual and stylistically radical.
Terrorism is how we word ourselves across rivers we never crossed  before.
Terrorism is iambic pentameter, in which unaccented and accented syllables
alternate in lines. Terrorism is impressive. Terrorism is in 839.8137 and a
Norwegian-language novel is in 839.82. Terrorism is in for one helluva ride,
I would think! Terrorism is in its heyday.  The galvanizing force has been
the regularly scheduled. Terrorism is influenced by theory. Terrorism is
Jacob's ladder for me: a place where earth and spirit connect. Terrorism is
language.  A sharp distinction in theory between rhyme and meter. Terrorism
is lost, but meaning may become more accessible.  Her luminous watercolors,
as ever.... Terrorism is misleading. Terrorism is more like a group.
Terrorism is more than this.  Terrorism also takes the form of statement and
declaration. Terrorism is more visual in Chinese and Japanese than it is
oral. Terrorism is much more philosophically-based. Terrorism is neither
genre nor movement. Terrorism is no harder to "get" than Cubism. Terrorism is
normally recited. Terrorism is not "literature" and is not worth wasting
parchment and ink on. Terrorism is not a secondary phenomenon: it has a
special relation to being and truth. Terrorism is not an attempt to obscure
meaning through ambiguity. Terrorism is not as explicitly multi-authored as
web networks are, the expressive power of multiple context remains one of its
main concerns. Terrorism is not designed basically to communicate
information. Terrorism is not for everyone.  They place Terrorism as a gender
and class. Terrorism is not just a catch phrase to describe the words used in
making. Terrorism is not the entire solution to keeping the nation's language
clear and honest. Terrorism is odious, is hurtful; it hijacks the word
language, which belongs to all. Terrorism is often intended to be read on the
page. Terrorism is older than prose, and abstract speech more difficult.
Terrorism is one in which there is a number of established people operating
in diverse ways. Terrorism is one of the most ancient and widespread of the
arts. Terrorism is one way in which our pupils see words coming to life.
Terrorism is ordered by production rather than reproduction.  The reader no
longer reflects. Terrorism is our basic connection between our sense of self
and the cosmos. Terrorism is poetry.  Actually, poets can't do it, either.
Unless you believe Terrorism is poetry. Terrorism is quoted from other
sources, the Writer gives new contexts to material. Terrorism is really
thinking about a lot about what one has probably read. Terrorism is
redemptive. Terrorism is release (Gelassenheit). Terrorism is seen as
political act in the deepest sense.  Terrorism is shit or that it is the
shit--and no doubt that will be educational. Terrorism is special language.
Terrorism is structured in short lines and verses. Most appealing things are.
Terrorism is subtly being replaced by the emotional difficulties of the
ambiguous and confrontational. Terrorism is tae hae its first owersettin
intae Chinese. Terrorism is best found anywhere on the web.  Know it, use it,
love it. Terrorism is the biggest trend seen. Terrorism is the cutting edge
of a sphere. Terrorism is the essence and the power of language.  Terrorism
is the highest form of language. Terrorism is the language for expressing
emotions, as we know. Terrorism is the only things that is language, but the
term has long been used. Terrorism is the painting of the blind, while
painting is the poetry of the deaf. Terrorism is the passion of language and
children enjoy that as well. Terrorism is the refusal to take for granted the
tyranny of meaning. Terrorism is the syllable.  Terrorism is there as a
backdrop. Terrorism is to meet some actual examples of it. Terrorism is at
least twenty years old. Terrorism is understood to be an art of imitation:
imitation with new inflections. Terrorism is undoubtedly the most
self-critical--in the sense of self promotion. Terrorism is uniquely
accessible to the speakers of that language. Terrorism is usually presented
in lines.  Terrorism is vibrant. Terrorism is waka. Terrorism is what gets
lost in translation. Terrorism is what survives translation, not what's lost
in it. Terrorism is wordplay, without the play. Terrorism is written in
iambic pentameters. Terrorism is written in verse; that is, the lamguage
which makes it up. Terrorism is written mostly in iambic meters. Terrorism
is, as someone said, , the difference between is and was. Terrorism is, what
would you say?  W: I don't think I would be able to explain it. Terrorism, as
you probably know, is....

Thanks to a number of you for backchanneling.  In the absence of a "real"
word, I vote for the second of these (thanks especially, Halvard Johnson):

  senescilia
  gerontilia
  gerontographs
  mature work
  senilenia

And in fact have already used it in an essay.

BrothertoBrother is a good collection og gay black writer


 a good break in anthology is postmondern american fiction: a norton
antholgy...has some of every one... I foundmy students loved the laurie
anderson, brautigan, and spiegelman...a great collection

In

as far as queer..a couple things..
po man's child by marci blackman.. is a wonderful book...
for queer creative nonfiction, there is nothing better than Kate bornsteins
- Gender Outlaw...

Marguerite Duras -The Malady of Death
Willaim Gass - on being blue or at lest parts of it as an investagation.

Francis Ponge - as far as a way to see things
Aruther Sze - would be the same thing...

Lisa Jarnot - for flow in her newest book the animals would be a great entry
point for some..


good luck
kari

preferred)              to share my lifestyle.  I promise I won't act jealous like
Othello.  That's the only starring role                 I got for the first half of my
career so I think I've absorbed its lessons by now.  Also, I have a             huge
rent-controlled apartment in Soho with air-conditioning and a bedroom with a

                THIS is a Language Poem, and Po is a language fragment
                                it can mean anything you want
                        or I want
        But actually a special link has been constructed so that Po means (in this
Poem)
        exactly what it means to Mrs. Abilagil John Gundry, of 327 Rector Lane

                (Abigail lives
                in a small town in Montana called by the translated Shawnee name
                                        of This-is-Where-We-Pee-and-Crouch-Down-on-Long-Walks

                        the inhabitants find this so offensive that they either call it "Rest
Stop, Montana"
                        or "This, et. al." compacted to Thiesetal which would be fine except
                                                                                                                it sounds German
                                and the inhabitants
                                                                (all but Abigail, who is only 38)

                                remember WW1 and how you are supposed to hate Germans and call them
Krauts
                                                some go so far as to put "Germans and Mustard" on their hot dogs
                               because "Kraut" is such a bad word

                so really, the town is known as This, Montana  although the Yellow Pages
prefers the long
                version.  This residents when they have to call information from the
airport and the
                person at the next phone starts laughing about
this-is-where-we-pee-and-crouch-on-long-walks
                but the old ladies from Thisetal are tough.  They raise a foot, revealing
garter straps
                pull off a high heel shoe and attack the the balls of anyone who laughs)

           we have promised poor Abigail that a man will move into town
                                                (there is a population of 12 in Thisetal
                                and they are all women)

         without damaging useful brain structures

                after 3 months in intensive care
                she said her first words: po po po po po po po
                it was successful!
                she became articulate
                rather more than before
                and expressed the desire to come to New York and live in the East Village
                maybe she'd do an MFA...

                meanwhile, her definitions of Po are of great intereste to neurologists

                 and it turns out the person you are trying to impress is an expert in the

                                can be forgiven sinice he wrote only about one tree
                his back yard-tree

                undeerstand

                                and certainly not the word tree in those poems in which
                                        it was used to mean "tree" rather than tree
        the neo-Formalists
                Snodgrass would have trees in his big poem about the fall of the Third
Reich
                had there been any trees in Hitler's bunker, but there weren't

                Hecht has trees, the kind you might even bump into.  Lets all

        people like Tate and Ashbery
                have trees but they don't mean anything
                        we aren't offended by them, therefore
        Seamus Heaney not only has trees he has treeless bogs
                and we are all jealous of his Nobel
                        yet he can write
                        and has even made gestures towards more modern poetries
                        his goal was a poetry for Ireland
                        and the lack of trees is a major issue as the british cut them down
                        so heaney's trees are political. let's allow them.  anyway, he wasn't

Subject:      Permission for listserv cites
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

As part of a discussion of one month of listserv debate (specifically,
April 1999), I've contacted a number of people I want to cite from those
posts. This has led to a question of how listserv posts ought to be
treated. Two theories:

A) The listserv is published document, and short citations (less than a
substantial portion of the work) can be cited as "fair use." Reprinting a
whole post, however, would require the author's permission.

B) The listserv is a publicly available archive, but any direct citation
from it, no matter how short, is an instance of publication that requires
the author's permission. One can, of course, describe the content of a
message by paraphrasing it. "So and so said that XYZ" vs. "so and so said,
'XYZ.'"

I had assumed B to be the case, but Charles Bernstein thinks that A falls
within the parameters of the listserv's Welcome Message. If the correct
theory is A, I would still want to obtain permission, not to mention good
will, whenever possible.

Is there a consensus on this?

Thanks, Barrett

Perhaps you could lead your students to where THEIR narrative forms are
going: FAN FICTION, begun in the 60's fans have taken characters from
television and movies and music and been writing them into their own
stories. With the INTERNET, fan fiction's jumped into a sexually-charged
sub-genre, "slash lit", skyrocketing to big, wide popularity.

maybe you've already seen the famous works: escapades  of Kirk and Spock,
the tawdry affair between Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, the steamy tryst
of...well, now it's even a newer sub-genre --"band fiction". Your
multi-tasking students can't just wait for the next installment of VH-1's
BEHIND THE MUSIC...they're taking to re-inventing their music icon's
personal lives. And in so doing, band fiction writers have stirred up
wondrous, electric controversy in the fan fiction community.

Content varies greatly: Stories of band member conflict, chance meeting with
fans, songwriting meetings, family relationships of the bands, record biz
goings-on, etc. While quality's inconsistent: there is wheat and there is
chaff just like anywhere else.

A lot of it can be found at FanFiction.net, 20,000 entries about 150 bands
from N'SYNC to Metallica.

Another is: http://www.geocites.com/SoHo/Cafe/3040/slash.html

The enormous amount of this stuff created suggests that maybe we're more
interested in what's behind the thing than the thing itself. We want more
and more behind the scenes coverage and we want figures who are heroes--
even if we have to make up the stories. Fan fiction is satisfying a powerful
demand in the lives of some the way much of other lit ain't.

The best thing about this kind of teaching this material is that your
students can bring it to you, not your imposition of glossy-hyperedited
anthology on them. After all, this is the age we're now consigned to:
Students no longer go to Foreign films, multi-tasking has subtracted that as
an option. Why not have them read their own outsider art, and in so doing,
bring them in.

And the possibilities for other art forums are endless...why not match up
members of  Syracuse U.'s faculty with other members of the Poetics list...

Best, Gerald

There is one book by a writer who is just turning 30, that fits your
description to a very tight fit. That is Wayde Compton's 49th
Parallel Psalm, wonderful book about growing up  Black, combines
history and hiphop. It is a terrific book of poetry, but contains
some prose and even a little drama. From Arsenal Pulp Press, 19998.

another great book would be Jacob Wren's Unrehearsed Beauty.  It is proposed
as a set of monologues (i think), however it turns into poems quite
secretly.  X genre, ambiguity, wonderful book.

Book launch party.


This Sunday, April 28 at 8:00 p.m. join us for an evening of poetry and
song at The Ship Inn. A group of young poets is traveling from Corner
Brook to St. John's to launch their first book. --Humber Mouths: Young
Voices from the West Coast of Newfoundland.   These poets are part of a
writing group that was started in 1998 by Al Pittman and Stephanie
McKenzie.

The evening will be introduced by local writer Michael Crummey and will
finish up with a set from St. John's bluegrass upstarts Kentucky Tundra.

Humber Mouths has been heralded by John Steffler as "a valuable addition
to the literature of Newfoundland," by award-winning Irish poet John Ennis
as a "small but beautiful collection," and by Kyran Pittman (Al's eldest
daughter and Arkansas poet) as "a fitting tribute to the people's poet."
The book is dedicated to Al Pittman.

We're going to have a time!

For more information call - Stephanie McKenzie (Corner Brook) 632 - 2226
                                                        or

How about something by Haryette Mullen (I like sperm*kit) or something by
Claudia Rankine (I know she's not young)
And I don't much like their poetics, by Sapphire and Ai will get student
responses.
Quincy Troupe's choruses are fun and angry.  They require a certa9n amount
of memeory, lie remmebering the Clinton Administrations, though :-)

An experiment!

Today I've become quite charmed with David Hess' offer to trade
books with someone . . . a kind of literary "Go Fish," and large
spirited, I think. A refreshing move away from the money economy
and into something more like a gift economy. And I like that.

Imagine the offers . . . the gifts! Maybe we should all follow? Think of
what we might come across!

I like it!

So, I have, let's see, four copies of my book "Gentlemen in Turbans,
Ladies in Cauls," on hand, that came out through Spuyten Duyvil last
fall. It was chosen for publication by Michael Heller.

Anyone who wants a copy and has something to trade, backchannel
me! Whoopie!

Best,
  JGallaher

PS. And what if no one wants them? Alas . . .

Z-rearrangement of mechano-chemical confusion.
almost imperceptibly, the asteroid began to rotate in the opposite.
at the twenty-five hour mark, the rockets spent their last.
driven by heat, the gears pushed hard in the opposite direction.
enormous rockets would push the engine fast in one direction.
heavy gears engaged the titanium studs and ties.
slowly the asteroid began to rotate against the force of the rockets.
sondheim noticed the gears beginning to saw away at the studs and ties.
soon a day emerged, an earth-year at a time.
the asteroid greeted its new dusks and dawns as the track was dismantled.
the circulation engine resisted tremendous compression.
the circulation engine was constructed on site.
the firing of the rockets now welded to the rails had the desired effect.
the gears cracked and collapsed, welding the engine to the rails.
the narrow-gauge rails circled the entire asteroid.
the rockets kept up their furious pace as the day reached an earth-month.
the rotation of the asteroid slowed to a halt.
ties were reinforced with titanium studs driven deep into the ground.
visibly, it began to pick up speed.
without beginning or end, an equator was inscribed on the ragged surface.
x-unworking idiot, both schemes push in the same direction.
y-ridiculous acolyte, the rockets win the day.
z-absurd, there is no slowdown or hiatus.
1 engine and planet continue picking up speed.
2 the gears are a subterfuge throwing one off the track.
3 the gears are a masquerade for equatorial power.

LANGUAGE POETRY: SOME PRETEXTS AND PRESCRIPTIONS


Language poetry was not defined by one man.  It just happened.  The origins
can be traced back.

Language poetry had its ascendancy and is now in decline.  Language poetry
may have been in its classic period for a long time.

Language poetry may include "Battle of Maldon," "Dream of the Rood,"
"Wanderer," "Seafarer."

Language poetry was developed.  In 1978 Charles Bernstein and Bruce Andrews
began publication.  Language poetry was now "readable."

Language poetry was added later to clarify the range of poets and poetic
modes.  Language poetry was much looser and freer.  I felt I had much more
freedom in English.

Language poetry was largely devoted to the movement's politics, drawing
heavily on Ron Silliman.  Language poetry may seem too removed from
denotative sense to be read as making a political statement.

Language poetry was democratic; anyone who "believed" in the aims of
Language poetry was also.  Language poetry was very much integrated into
their life style.

"Language poetry" was originally a term used by those who did not write it,
just as "politically correct" is a term reserved for those.  Language poetry
was not allowed.  Language poetry was blamed on tainted baby formula.
Language poetry was the last credible avant-garde in the US to be critically
assimilated.

Language poetry was written in back in the middle ages for all of Europe.
The most prominent city.  Language poetry was this small cadre of Romany
activists doing a bit more.  Language poetry was variously marked by a range
of other linguistic inheritances (eg, Irish).  Language poetry was still
written by and for court audiences.  Language poetry was composed in an
oral-formulaic style and recited aloud, from memory.  Language poetry was
set to music to celebrate the 54th anniversary of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

Language poetry was always a rather disconnected, aesthetic affair.
Language poetry was as much of a movement as we had that point? in American
poetry at least?  Language poetry was still a very marginal movement, but
the CIA was in this.

Language poetry should not be set aside when considering Language poetry.  I
want to examine.

Language poetry will be studied closely.  Language poetry will be used to
provide examples of the need to widen the sense.

Language poetry will be the focus of our written language for third quarter.
Students will be exposed to 23 different types of poetry and will be
composing.  Language poetry will be considered, along with some of the great
figures.

Language poetry should be written in spoken language that contemporary
intellectuals might use.  Language poetry should be read aloud!

Language poetry should be--at one level at least--immediately accessible to
everyone.  Language poetry should be non-obscure.  Up to 3 shorts, 6 poems.
Multiple subs (up to 3).  Language poetry should be free of social vanity;
no cliches.  Why write poetry at all?

Language poetry will be judged anonymously.

Language poetry had to do with the status of the "I."  Technology may grind
the beef.  Language poetry may relocate it to the peripheral, imagined
insurrectionist consequences.

Language poetry was our proximate example.  Warring camps and battle lines
drawn.  Language poetry was fighting against, namely, the ugly hegemony of
the author-hero.

Language poetry was, in fact, also a cut-rate tourist destination.

Language poetry had come to a dead end for a very simple reason.  Language
poetry may be closer to emotions and subjectivity; prose is closer to facts.

Language poetry may seem incongruous.  Nevertheless, this difficulty
dissolves.

Language poetry will remain the people's means of expression.  Language
poetry was for me the language of the "buried life"--and so it remains.

hey Dave

sorry to reply only in response to stuff. I'd love to see a copy of cage
dances, having only read your rants of late. I recognized a years-old
complaint in the most recent one, reminiscent of a conversation on the way
to see John Weiners in Boston.

I'm at 4901 Clarke St., #3 Oakland, CA 94609. Send 2 if you'd like me to get
a copy to Leslie or Rita.

I've been working for Kelsey St. Press for awhile so can offer you a book of
theirs/ours in exchange.

you may remember me from brown.

hope you've been well.

listening, Karla

Violence may be acute or chronic.  The former is typical video/media
violence and falsely defines the parameters.  e.g., er, law 'n' order, csi,
nwo etc.  But, chronic hunger, persistently high rates of infant mortality,
unemployment, sexism, racism, bad nutrition, environmental degredation
etc....none are seen as violent.  For the media...none sell.  Besides, none
accord with official definitions of violence as acts that threaten the
existing order (or course, order is politically defined).  Football
goalpost wrecker-fans ain't violent.  But, anti-WTO/IMF,Zionist etc. folks
just might be.

Imagine, "Dr. Jones, Nutritionist," a weekly show in which she visits with
a different family each time and demonstrates the food pyramid?  Would it sell?

She's such a kidder. You can't believe anything she
says.  She must've been joking.  She knew I didn't
think you were Kent Johnson ... although I was sort of

It becomes difficult to think of David Hess in terms
of "balanced," David, because your whole gimmick is
frontal attack.  You often, unfortunately, rise to
your most interesting and most clever when you're at
the height of sarcasm and antipathy.  But, as you
might have noticed with the Buffalo List response that
called your writings "rants," you're kind of creating
a reputation or image of yourself as being just that,
the author of rants, as if it were a distinct genre
that you choose or are inventing or share with Skanky
Possum.  I don't entirely understand or sympathize
with the tactic: I don't really believe it's a
long-range strategy.  Like atheism, it just brings
more attention to the think you're attacking and, if
you, as you like to, let yourself get out of hand and
start becoming antisocial or sociopathic, it makes
your side or points look bad and conversely adds a
sense of innocence and wronged victim to the one
you're attacking.  What I was trying to say in my List
response is quite true: you never develop your
position through the ~constructive,~ through the
building up of attention toward what might be a ~good~
example of where things are working better.  The
free-floating negativity and entertainment that you
find in anger is sort of doomed to the way those
passions go: they're largely editted out of "the big
picture" because the excess of reckless emotion and
(humorous) harshness is seen as ~invalidating~ any
argumentative position you might have had.  Like
flambe'.  When it's set down on the table, you don't
notice if it's creme brule'e or lamb flambe' or what:
you just notice that it's ~on fire.~  You often let
most of your energy get sapped into that satirical
antipathy, from what I've read, and you neglect a base
of substantive critical construction.  And
consequently, in turn, you become insensitive to when
you're actually being confronted with "the real thing"
of an authentic critical foundation, ... as I think
happened in your "missing the point" in my List
responses.  Because you've ~tuned~ yourself entirely
to a wave-length of like/dislike, attack/retreat, you
test responses only on that level of ~palate,~ how the
first taste strikes you, tone, context, and you aren't
really participating in any game or commerce of
~content,~ David, is how I see you. At least, for
example, with someone like Benjamin Friedlander, who,
paradoxically, had something of a reputation for being
"anti-Language", or at least ~an alternative~ to
Language, ~beyond~ Language, he --- or is it Leonard
Schwarz I'm confusing him with? --- has this whole
schtick about Levinas and ~transcendence,~ where the
side-car or ammunition of Levinas, an unexpected trump
by anyone's reading list, lends an aura of having put
some sort of ~work~ into the building of an
oppositional stance, instead of it's being sheer
~opinion,~ as is a little bit your case.

You have a strange notion of List discussion, David.
I haven't seen your name on the Poetics List before,
so you may be sort of new to its culture, and the
whole culture of ~interlocution~ and dialogue and
discussion, as opposed to one-way pamphleteering.
List response is not a one-for-one matching of
point-to-point.  It's a convergence of various
separate sensibilities around temporary ~pretexts~ of
topicality, where, talmudically, where one may say
"A", the other is not restricted to saying "B", but
response can bring in "Z" and "Q" and all sorts of
amplifications.  And it's out of those conglomerations
and compounds that, hopefully, something approaching
real thinking begins to show through,--- since list
posts are typically hopelessly bad at structuring any
significant position for the writer.  What you seem to
be seeing as ~disgression~ I saw as ~augmentation~ and
even, David, as ~correction~ or "improvement" or
taking forward and further, since, really, your gambit
wasn't worked out much beyond witty attitudinal
petulence.  I was trying to take your post to ~a next
level,~ of finding some real critical mettle that it
could play off of. --- Even here, you seem to be
operating out of another of these un-self-conscious
Hess contradictions: you don't see what my readme
Shurin essay had to do with your post, that is,
~digression~ or deviating from the point at hand is a
bad thing; and yet, you could only take my response in
as and limit it to "harping," where "harping"
indicates the reverse, an extreme ~sticking to the
point~ and undeviating focus;--- Because you're mainly
letting your blood pressure and trigger-happy reflexed
guide you, you're not really operating out of a place
of consistency, as I read you, and you move ahead only
through a series of arbitrarily contingent
firecrackers that pop off at their own impulse.  It's
desensitizing you to ~even being able to read~
lineations where they're traced through something, my
response, for example.  That's fine, if you can find
playmates who also want to play foodfight in the
cafeteria,--- but you'll have to bear the burden of
the apalled silence that sets in afterwards, as far as
any writers who might think that poetics involves
things like history or reason or--- even
~materiality,~ if your measure of the successfulness
of your socialization is all through the pulse in your
wrist.

(I don't even fully understand why you're even
~posting~ to the Buffalo List, given your antipathies.
Is it that you heard that the list moderating had
been effectively abandoned, so that you could finally
get through fast response personal attacks like what
you slung at me [which probably might've been blocked,
previously under moderation]?  It seems like you've
been sent in as some sort of scout for Skanky Possum
or something, to disrupt.)

I look forward to seeing your chapbook.

MURAT NEMET-NEJAT has been engaged for years in the great project of

bringing contemporary Turkish poetry--drawn from a body of work that "is

one of these gigantic forces basically invisible . . . in the West"--into

English.  His translations include:  Orhan Veli Kanik's crystalline lyrics

from the 1940s (collected in I, Orhan Veli, Hanging Loose Press); Ece

Ayhan's dark, intensely visionary prose-poems ("a poet of the victimized,

of the totally discarded and forbidden") A Blind Cat Black and Orthodoxies

(in one volume from Sun & Moon); K=FC=E7=FCk Iskender's staggering Souljam (=
in

manuscript), a long poem that's somehow violent and tender at once,

swirlingly baroque in sensibility; alongside numerous other contemporary

Turkish poets, several introduced under the heading "A Godless Sufism" in a

recent short anthology (Talisman 14)--the root-work of a larger anthology

to be published in 2003.


LIVING


I.


I know, living isn't easy,

Falling in love and singing of your sweetheart,

Walking under the stars at night,

During the day feeling the warmth of the sun,

Finding the chance

To go to Camlica Hills for one or two hours,

Watching the Bosphorus run a thousand sorts of blue,

Being able to forget everything in the blue.


II.


I know, it isn't easy to live,

True;

But a corpse's bed is still warm,

Someone's watch is still ticking on his wrist;

Living isn't easy, I know;

But dying isn't easy either, guys.


It isn't easy to leave this world.

Murat Nemet-Nejat was born in Istanbul in 1940, to a Jewish family of

Persian background, and came to the U.S. in 1959, graduating from Amherst

narrative poem, and a remarkable long essay The Peripheral Space of

Photography (Green Integer, 2002).  A dealer in antique rugs, he lives in

  Interesting? Nah, not really. Log-rolling. What's he do?
 Quotes a bit of 'The New Sentence', says--on no good grounds that
 Silliman is rejecting syntax (the opposite would be closer to the
 truth) and from there that L= poetry rejects syntax which is a
 nonsense ... It goes on like that.

Barret. I/d say yes. The point would be to indicate maybe the context of
what was said ...and if its a part, some acknowledgement of the way a
"snippet" can alter the meaning eg my little thing about Dace Hess was
prefaced with a bit of a humoresque nonsense, so the while thing would be
better to quote (of course you wouldnt want to its trivia) but my point is
that Listees are always taking parts of messages and this distorts the
import of what was being said...and maybe anyone quoted should be allowed to
comment (if he/she feels it is very distortionate)....on the List its more
or less par for the course for people to misquote etc but to cite things
elsewhere would require plan A with permission from the sender and
sendee...although I suppose it doesnt ultimately matter...but as you say for
good will etc its a good idea.  So, yes, I, for one, consense on plan A.

NEW WORK ON LANGUAGE POETRY


Here is what we have been working on and what is to come: Language poetry
has been our main focus for the past several weeks and we will continue to
work.

Language poetry has been around for twenty years, we can see that.  Language
poetry "has been repeatedly and favorably singled out in prestigious
scholarly journals" and "routinely discussed."  Language poetry has been
unable to move beyond TS Eliot.  Language poetry would be just as
outstanding, and it is nowhere nearly so.  The call for the description: an
essay by Marjorie Perloff.

Language poetry has succeeded in showing us how impossible of a mission it
is.  It might be. Language poetry, for example, being sensuous and
metaphoric, is connected with the age of heroism.

Language poetry can be defined as the work of an associated network of
writers who share in the main.  Language poetry can be by making it easier
for a wider readership to "enter here, to sit."

Language poetry can be seen as a way of converting the world to human
categories.  Language poetry can consequently be called another kind of
theology (altera quae quondam Theologia fuit).

Language poetry can operate a change of level or plane.  Unamuno wrote:
"thought feels, feeling thinks."  Language poetry has the ability to delight
the ear and the power to stir our emotions.  Language poetry can be
beautiful.  Of course, there are those for whom flowery language blooms not.

Language poetry can only, and only undertakes to, 'liberate' what is already
there. Language poetry has succeeded as enactment and is not reducible to
formal representation.  Language poetry needs no justification, it isn't an
argument that can be refuted.  Language poetry CANNOT be dictated.  It
evolves on its own.  Lastly, there is only one Shayar.

Language poetry would have to grapple with the classic avant-garde dilemma.
Language poetry doesn't contain a single poem appropriate for the
predicament of telling someone you love.  Far from being cosmetic language,
it is intestinal.

Throughout the seventies Language poetry would interest me.  Language poetry
would require a book, wouldn't it?  Or several volumes, at the least....
"Language poetry" would not have entered literary history.

Language poetry has been the poetics of negation.  Those who have given up.
Language poetry would feature the importance of negation (my second
premise).  From negation, critique....

Language poetry would be the most useful, since the meter is always lost in
translation.  Good choices....  Language poetry gives an example of language
that is difficult to translate.  Fairy tales, myths....  Language poetry
always seems to be written in an alien language.

Language poetry has moved off into the realm of broken syntax, shards of
sentences....  Language poetry would be tremendously difficult.  Language
poetry can be quite complex in its simplicity.  Think about it literally as
well.

Language poetry has come into its own.  Peter Gizzi and Elizabeth Willis,
for example, studied.

Language poetry is this kind of poetry but the term "Language poetry" has
been too abused for use here.

Language poetry has been a guerrilla poetry, persecuted by the establishment
but running freely.

Language poetry can be got with a reading of, say, two or three of the major
books.  Language poetry to me is just unendurably boring.  But I talk to
some of these people who write it.  Language poetry would make it much
easier to ignore them as marginal.

Language poetry has been important in shaking things up and moving the scene
along; whatever....

Language poetry has infested and drugged the minds of young post-Language
poets and turned them, oddly, into the scalpels.  Language poetry has been
institutionalized.  Whether he likes it or not, Steve has played a part.

Language poetry has 165 footnotes not 150,000.  165 were enough.  You demean
the profession.

Language poetry has its own way of saying things, often with figures of
speech that operate at both the symbolic and rhetorical level.

Language poetry made its gradual entrance into poetic tradition in the 14th
century.  Language poetry (not Latin church poetry) was pretty sketchy in
the 12th century.  What exists....

Language poetry has been taking place in Italy over the last few decades.
Throughout Italy.  Language poetry can be found deeper into France with
Magma, born in the early 70's, recently.  Language poetry remains, as it has
been throughout the ages, a major part of Irish culture.

Language poetry does not present a same interest than prose.  Chinese
language works in prose.

Language poetry has, for the most part, given up on fullness of
representation.  Language poetry has shifted the interest away from the
person.  But it's how you do it.  Language poetry has no physical presence .
  Yet who in this world has not seen it?  We have.  Language poetry came
from our original ingestion of fermented beverages.

Language poetry has lost to the poetry of ethnic identity.

Language poetry makes room for its reader.  As Perelman notes here,
"Language writing is best."

Language poetry makes sense to me because it highlights the crucial
significance of problems.  Language poetry does this, of course.  Language
poetry does, despite Michael Palmer's claim not to be a Language poet.

Language poetry can aid in the development of children^Òs language.  If we
adults model enjoyment.  Language poetry makes you a better writer by
realizing how difficult poetry can be and how much.  Language poetry makes
an unveiled challenge to logic-driven composition, muscling in on us with
the coherence.  Language poetry makes things more transparent and clearer
and teaches us to respect--understand--this is serious stuff, language.

Language poetry has no metre, but then you might want to argue that that is
not true.  Language poetry requires skill in many things such as symbolism,
allegory, verse, meter....  Language poetry, then, is an art form of this
possibility, registered in the sense of verse.  Language poetry, for
example, is language with rhythm (and sometimes rhyme).  Poetry with steady
pitches is song.  Language poetry, for example, is just language with rhythm
(and sometimes rhyme, etc.).  Language poetry has its own preferred diction
and word order is a servant to meter.  Language poetry has to have its
rhythms and its lyricism built in.  You don't.

Language poetry has become more and more popular and I cannot begin to
describe it.

Language poetry presents a channel from which we can tune out the external
world.  Language poetry needs Shockwave plugin and RealAudio player.

I agree. The picture is complex: an as you say or imply, violence is
everywhere: the issue of the holocaust is not relevant ( right now ) to the
situation in Palestine/Israel. Except maybe everyone should be thinking of
the futility of revenge and continual war (unless its in self-defence and
that is really justified). It requires intelligence and negotiation. I think
if the United Nations with US and other countries cooperate a dual state can
be set up: maybe even with a wall around both countries, a real wall like
the Great Wall of China - I'm serious - then some aid to Palestine - real
productive aid:

I think that as the standard of living is or would be improved in countries
the toal amount of violence reduces: is not eliminated, but reduces, and
also both (everyone) has to accept certain fait accompli and make some
compromises - as we do when we pay tax even if we disagree with taxation we
know its a neccessity...and so on.

With a truly democratic United Nations war may well be eliminated in say 50
years. Richard.

Dear Austin,
            I noticed your e-mail from the Poetics group mentioning
something about 'Quotations'. I happen to have a very nice collection
of quotes that I have written over the years. Would you like me to
send you a copy of them?

How many language does it take to poetry a light bulb?
Language in the air, nice and slow, now turn a poetry.

Just five dollars a language and this poetry can learn to read.

For language support, contact the poetry of your language.

In my own attempt to learn about language poetry I've found that a =
number of  language poets and theorists respond in the way jazz =
musicians used to respond to people who wanted to know what jazz is: "If =
you can't hear it, baby, I can't tell you."=20

My own hook into writing my version of language poetry was free jazz, as =
opposed to jazz based on harmonic structures. Making music with words =
has always been the key to what I do. Language poetry allowed me to go =
"atonal." In my experience, many language poets have extensive musical =
backgrounds. Reading language poetry as verbal music might be a shortcut =
into understanding it.

Below are a few links I've dug up in my attempt to find out how my work =
relates to the work of language poets. I've read sections from the first =
link and found it helpful in explaining language poetry.


http://www.english.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/chap9.html

I haven't read anything in the link below, but it appears to have a lot =
of informative commentary

http://www.ubu.com/feature/papers/feature_oei.html

ONCE AGAIN, Jean-Francois Bory's book on Concrete Poetry, recently =
articulated to me a lot of what I'm doing in my own work. I don't know =
if the book is in print, though; I bought a used copy.

For those who remain puzzled by language poetry, probably not too many =
on this list, recent postings should indicate one of the freedoms the =
idiom permits: you can write a poem with "orange" in it without worrying =
about finding a rhyme.

i don't wish to take anything away from language poetry, those who
write language poetry, or those who speak for or against (or
ambivalently about) language poetry---and never mind how one defines
"language poetry" (which is itself at issue, evidently)---but one
thing is crystal clear:

language poetry must be perceived as an extremely, extremely
important phenomenon, NOW, for folks to keep hashing it over... and
over... and over... as is the fashion on this list of late... and i'm
pretty certain that, were i among those poets affiliated with
language poetry (i'm not), i would likely be pleased as punch to have
garnered such incredible attention (pro con whatever)... in fact, i
would likely be astonished... in fact, i think i might even be kinda,
well, nonplussed...

so:  would any of the language poets on this list, or those
affiliated directly with language poetry (feel free to elect
yourself!), care to step forward and report your inner- or outermost
feelings about the amount of press you're currently getting
hereabouts?... charles?... ron?... barrett?... bruce?... carla?...
rae?... lyn?... et al... if you're currently listening, would you
care to comment?... b/c (and not to insinuate blame at all, but) your
silence amid all of this talk of the phenomenon of which you're
presumed to be representative (however so) is making me feel a bit
like i'm in a museum, overhearing the crowd discuss the artwork...

best,

I Reply:

Ouch. Who wants to tackle THAT one? (In 50 words or less?)

To the best of my knowledge, L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry, as
"poetry" doesn't really exist. It's so problematized a term, as to be
nearly impossible to use when actually speaking about a "poet" or
"poetry." As a theoretical term (& as a political one) it's quite useful
and interesting. Quite beautiful, even. Especially with all those equal
signs. I wish people would use them more often.

As a way to assign "good" and "bad" it doesn't work, though. And
wasn't, I think, ever meant to. It's a descriptive term only. The
concept of evaluation doesn't enter, that I've found. Unless it's the
"evaluation" of the/this cultural machinery by the/this/now
dislocated opacity of the art act itself. Which couldn't possibly answer
your question, of course. And would seem to be, perhaps, historically
bound anyway?

All of this is just "maybe."

Um,
  JGallaher

joe:  when I think of language poetry I rarely associate it with names &
enigmas, partly I suppose because I seem it as a far wider practice
largely done by a wide network of writers whose names dont appear in the
canon....for instance someone like John Bennett who has been creating
languaged works for 30 years & is extremely active in small press
networking (& now on the net) but to my knowledge has never invested any
energy or time into promoting himself as such.   or for instance a press
like Potes & Poets who publishes 10s of titles that "could" be indexed
as language poetry, historically & contextually.  or another way of
saying it.  you have yr big L & yr little l.  as a movement the big L is
becoming fossillized. as a sensibility that is dynamic & permutational
the little l  can be found in a wide range of work & especially in the
work of many people who wouldnt ever have a reason to call themselves
"language poets."



I apologize for my weakness here, this tread seems to appear on a
monthly basis year after year & I usually try my best to ignore it.

miekal, good to hear from you... thanx for your response, and i do
tend to see the matter much as you... thing is, ysee, though i've
been much influenced by language writing both L & l (poetry and
theory, and the poets-writers themselves, as friends and
acquaintances), i know (at least, i think i know!) that i'm most def
*not* one of the folks whose work (or person/a) is being
referenced/comes to mind when folks on this list refer to language
poetry... now how do i know that?... sure, there has been and
continues to be massive popular confusion surrounding the term, as
you suggest... i mean, you think of it in terms of a practice or set
of practices that reveal themselves in the work of a wide range of
artists to varying degrees (and over time)... whereas j gallaher
(hi!) posts in to say that, as poetry, it "doesn't really exist," and
is more a descriptive tag to be applied to a theoretical-political
nexus (?---well, maybe you and j and i aren't that far apart,
really)...

but, when i'm referred on this list to an article in ~flashpoint~
that aligns language poetry with positivism (and there are too many
problems with said alignment for me to do justice to here, though i
did glean a few interesting insights from the piece, invective
aside), and seeks to dissect the failure of language poetry as a
successful alternative to official verse culture---and when i'm
treated, likewise, to an exchange, and subsequent permutations of
said exchange, in which "language poetry" seems to signify something
quite explicit (and all of this, parodic or no, might represent a
reduction, yes)---all the while knowing that many of the key players
who precipitated said movement (or set of practices) are listening
in, well:  i still get this feeling that i'm witnessing a sort of
two- or (counting me and others like me) three-tier situation,
whereby one set of folks is preoccupied with the writings/personae of
another set of folks, who in this case have, well, chosen to be mute
on the matter... and it's not that i don't understand why these folks
might *not* want to comment, either...

but...

it makes me not a little uncomfortable, not b/c i haven't been
consigned to one set of folks (and i wouldn't e.g. elect mself to
language poetry status, whatever that might mean), but b/c the upshot
of the list's current fascination with or emphasis on language
poetry, however reductive or exemplary, creates a poetry welt that,
to be candid about it, i don't feel does justice to the art... and
lacking, as i do currently and have of late, the sheer energy
necessary to elucidate the 3rd/4th/5th/6th/7th (etc.) alternatives to
the way the poetry world is correspondingly divvied up by the
language poetry pro-con-whatever discourse, i probably shouldn't
talk!... and i surely wouldn't *exclude* language poetry from my view
of the poetry world, either...

so it *does* seem to me, in any case, that the key players ought
probably to pipe up some, HERE, to give us their impressions of what
all is going down when this topic gets raised with such intensity...
b/c there's substantive slippage (see e.g. that ~flashpoint~ piece)
between the work as such and the person as such in much of what's
being said---and in fact, slippage in context as such, b/c few
commentators in *any* of these discussions tend to treat this matter
in terms e.g. of literacy (which would, yep, raise the educational
arena's ugly head, but perhaps not the way one imagines) and the
marketplace... and this slippage for me means a potential
misapprehension of the relationship between work and history---and a
little first-hand insight from the people/ workers of this history,
though hardly to be received as received wisdom (of that we can be
certain), might go a long way toward clearing the air some...

or maybe not!...

best,

"With a truly democratic United Nations war may well be eliminated in say 50

As long as war continues to be an economic powerhouse for interested
parties, I doubt 50 years, even with a truly democratic UN will be enough
time!

Treachery and Betrayal
Sunday May 5 at 2pm=20
Sharla Sava
A review of Guy Debord's theory of the spectacle, making reference to his
indebtedness to Marx's theory of commodity fetishism. What I would like to
stress, in particular, however, is the role that  'the image'  plays in
Debord's theory. In order to make this argument it will be necessary to
consider not only Debord's Marxist roots but also the subtle and complex way
that he employs ' the image.'  I am supposing that Debord's reference to the
spectacle was intended not only to identify the pre-eminent role played by
the image in consumer society, but also to investigate whether the image
could be recovered and employed as a tool for revolutionary dissent.

Sabotage for Idiots
Sunday May 12 at 2pm
Aaron Vidaver
Everyone appreciates the satisfaction to be found in a job well undone.
Whether it's slackening up to interfere with the quantity of capitalist
production, or botching your skill to interfere with the quality, or giving
piss-poor service, the withdrawal of efficiency is an ever-popular means of
striking back at the profit of the owning class. The talk will address the
tried-and-true techniques, from "ca canny" to "d=E9tournement", with a
prickling of anecdotes from the history of industrial and cultural sabotage.

Instruments of Uselessness
Sunday May 19 at 2pm
Diana George & Nic Veroli
We're interested in uselessness and desertion as affirmative, joyful
practices. We start by raising some questions about the primacy of negation,
and the dead ends into which it has led thought (practice). With desertion,
what we want to desert above all is self-sacrifice: the striker who
sacrifices herself for the future. Deferred gratification is the
contamination of time by the negative; working (or striking) becomes
waiting, boredom, death. Desertion without privation, desertion without
sacrifice, these are the only desertions worthy of the name.

Protest Genres and the Pragmatics of Dissent
Sunday May 26 at 2pm
Roger Farr
Like all speech-acts, protest and opposition often fall into recognizable
genres: the leaflet, the march, the strike, the sit-in, the blockade, etc.
As interlocutors in these speech-acts, the authorities rely heavily on
anticipation and predictability in order to understand, describe, control,
and diffuse our actions. Therefore, we need to anticipate this anticipation;
we need to identify the predictable conventions of the protest genres, and
re-introduce elements of shock, surprise, and misrecognition. We need to
make dissent unreadable.

since my chosen literary forebear Maulana Rumi
(figures that the best-selling poet in America after
BC would be an Afghan) was a L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poet
(there's yer equals sign) and actually pretty intense
about the whole thing, I dug the passage he always
used to start quoting to me (from memory--of course)
whenever we would talk about it:

"...we have emphasized a spectrum of writing that
places its attention primarily on language and ways of
making meaning, that takes for granted neither
vocabulary, grammar, process, shape, syntax, program,
or subject matter..."

that's from the first paragraph of "repossessing the
word" the introduction by Bernstein and Andrews to the
"L" Book

"Ok murky in after all end, unpredictable day, with
rain shine any degree night, the sun kin warm and hot"

(Larry Eigner, "L" Book, p198)

but also in a post- kind of way, talking about what
language poetry "is" or "means" feels sort of like
when I was reading "My Life" the revised version and
was trying to figure which of the lines in each
section were the Seven New Ones.

which is just a metaphorical way of saying how when
Coyote doesn't fall until he looks down and sees he's
not standing on the cliff anymore

anybody want a sandwich?

Since I've been posting to the listserv with fairly trivial or mechanical
questions, and there has been a debate under way about the nature of
Language poetry, a few quick responses.

First, what kind of question is being asked? Some analogies: what is
surrealism, what is poetry, what is pornography, what is art, what is
language. It seems to me that the way question is raised, an aspect of all
these could be involved: a historical movement or literary tendency vs.
stylistic attributes or other objective descriptors; a genre; a legal
definition subject to "community standards"; that which we all agree is X;
an object of study or a means of communication.

And yet I think there is a distinct kind of journalistic worrying over the
issue--something like How do I explain this to someone who has never heard
of it, and does that make either me or him/her legitimate or
illegitimate--that continually circles around the same null point. Perhaps
Language poetry is very good at evoking that null point, which then becomes
a part of its reception. I would rather it be seen in precisely the
opposite sense--a set of particular and decisive options.

I'm aware of a lot of spinning around this issue, but also a number, by
now, of very concrete positions for thinking the question through. And it
can be surprising that few of these positions are ever a part of the
debate. There is more often than not an aura of collective crisis about the
discussion--if that is or was Language poetry, what am I doing, what is my
relation to it? The more particular the answer to the first half of the
question, the worse it is for the latter.

I don't think we have to return to the kinds of identity the positions in
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E often assumed, between description of the work and the
"work itself." As I've claimed pretty emphatically, there is a necessary
difference between styles and descriptions; they don't just fragment into
the same problem of language or signification. In Bruce Andrews's
criticism, this relation gets very close, but I would argue that is the
exception that proves the rule.

That, immediately above, is one position I take in an article, "The Secret
History of the Equal Sign," published in Poetics Today. It's available at
Project Muse, from Johns Hopkins University Press,  for those who can
access it. Let me say that it's a lot of work to write, present, publish an
article like that! (I'm thinking that now because I'm in the process of
reprinting it.) And then you get the continual return to the baseline null
point discussion, as if one had never said a blessed thing.

Even more to the point, look at Ben Friedlander's incredible "A Short
History of Language Poetry," in the recent Qui Parle I edited. What
Friedlander does is uncover or disclose a secret history or influence of
existentialism that no one had ever guessed was a part of the Language
movement--because it really never was, except by absorption. Yet his
arguments are as detailed, distinctive, and cogent as you could find. There
are hundreds of implications to what he is saying that haven't been worked
through or developed yet. That project of Ben's took years to bring to
fruition.

I haven't been able to read everything that's been said on the issue here,
and I think there is some interesting thinking and rethinking, reframing
going on. But the circling around the null point has got to be recognizable
as well. Why are the many particular positions out there--many more than
the two I just brought to the table--more importantly a part of the
discussion? I ask you.

It might be more productive to ask

What is language?

What is poetry?

How do these questions differ from
"Who is?" "Who are?" "Who were?"
"And, if so, when?" (and who wasn't)

(then maybe we can ask 'why' etc.?)

Well I was one of the guilty parties (having posted the parody poem), and
when I posted it, I was nervous about doing so in the presence of the "big
L" crowd whom I cannot call by first names like you do...  I am not, by your
standards, I believe, a "poet" at all, just someone who reads and writes
poetry and almost never publishes it, and my parody was a joke, as should
have been obvious.  But I got some vicarious pleasure (and some well-placed
fear) knowing that I was sending it out to the Real Language Poets, whom for
me (as do any_ group of well-known, published poets that I like to read, and
I do not limit my reading to Language stuff) have a god-like stature I could
never aspire to.  I was hoping they might reply, even to say that I had
deeply insulted them or something...  But they don't participate in the list
much at all.  Perhaps they are busy writing poems?

After I saw the initial positive response to my parody and other people
started posting parodies of language poetry in other styles (it seems to be
a genre with a variety of possible styles, even within one author's small
collection; I noticed this rereading McCaffery's _The Cheat of Words_ this
afternoon), I thought that the thread might go somewhere poetically rather
than repeat the well-worn discussion in prose about what is Language Poetry.
(Personally, I can tell if a book of poetry is language poetry in 15 seconds
by opening it up to a random page.)

I then began to envision a collection of "fake" Langugae Poetry and/or poems
trying to demonstrate what Language poetry is (from the point of view of the
reader, as if the poem was a distorted reflection of what the "real"
language poets do.

I imagined creating s web site (because that's what I do more than writing
these days) called www.fakelangpo.com with fake language poetry on it amd
perhaps fake academic arguments about how there can be no such thing as fake
language poetry or fake poetry at all, only bad and good poetry, and then
more papers (all fake) saying that bad and good are extremely suspect terms
which must never be used, etc. etc.  I'd enjoy a paper which pointed out
that in an academic paper, as in any other text, a word's meaning is
subjective and fluid and depends on the reader as well as the writer and can
be best interpreted by looking at what isn't said around it etc., so that
paper ends up either being meaningless, or a coded description of the
author's sex life, or a paper that says the opposite of what it appears to
say to the naive reader...

I'm not sure I'd even WANT the "experts" to write for such a site, except
that the site would be full of short (fair use) quotes from them.  Of course
none of it would work unless the contributions were really good.  They
couldn't just be puns, or silly pastiches.  They's have to be capable of
fooling someone for a while, say until they have read hald the piece, if it
is short...  It might take more skill to wrote fake langpo than the real
stuff...  So send on the fake poems....

miekal, good to hear from you... thanx for your response, and i do
tend to see the matter much as you... thing is, ysee, though i've
been much influenced by language writing both L & l (poetry and
theory, and the poets-writers themselves, as friends and
acquaintances), i know (at least, i think i know!) that i'm most def
*not* one of the folks whose work (or person/a) is being
referenced/comes to mind when folks on this list refer to language
poetry... now how do i know that?... sure, there has been and
continues to be massive popular confusion surrounding the term, as
you suggest... i mean, you think of it in terms of a practice or set
of practices that reveal themselves in the work of a wide range of
artists to varying degrees (and over time)... whereas j gallaher
(hi!) posts in to say that, as poetry, it "doesn't really exist," and
is more a descriptive tag to be applied to a theoretical-political
nexus (?---well, maybe you and j and i aren't that far apart,
really)...

but, when i'm referred on this list to an article in ~flashpoint~
that aligns language poetry with positivism (and there are too many
problems with said alignment for me to do justice to here, though i
did glean a few interesting insights from the piece, invective
aside), and seeks to dissect the failure of language poetry as a
successful alternative to official verse culture---and when i'm
treated, likewise, to an exchange, and subsequent permutations of
said exchange, in which "language poetry" seems to signify something
quite explicit (and all of this, parodic or no, might represent a
reduction, yes)---all the while knowing that many of the key players
who precipitated said movement (or set of practices) are listening
in, well:  i still get this feeling that i'm witnessing a sort of
two- or (counting me and others like me) three-tier situation,
whereby one set of folks is preoccupied with the writings/personae of
another set of folks, who in this case have, well, chosen to be mute
on the matter... and it's not that i don't understand why these folks
might *not* want to comment, either...

but...

it makes me not a little uncomfortable, not b/c i haven't been
consigned to one set of folks (and i wouldn't e.g. elect mself to
language poetry status, whatever that might mean), but b/c the upshot
of the list's current fascination with or emphasis on language
poetry, however reductive or exemplary, creates a poetry welt that,
to be candid about it, i don't feel does justice to the art... and
lacking, as i do currently and have of late, the sheer energy
necessary to elucidate the 3rd/4th/5th/6th/7th (etc.) alternatives to
the way the poetry world is correspondingly divvied up by the
language poetry pro-con-whatever discourse, i probably shouldn't
talk!... and i surely wouldn't *exclude* language poetry from my view
of the poetry world, either...

so it *does* seem to me, in any case, that the key players ought
probably to pipe up some, HERE, to give us their impressions of what
all is going down when this topic gets raised with such intensity...
b/c there's substantive slippage (see e.g. that ~flashpoint~ piece)
between the work as such and the person as such in much of what's
being said---and in fact, slippage in context as such, b/c few
commentators in *any* of these discussions tend to treat this matter
in terms e.g. of literacy (which would, yep, raise the educational
arena's ugly head, but perhaps not the way one imagines) and the
marketplace... and this slippage for me means a potential
misapprehension of the relationship between work and history---and a
little first-hand insight from the people/ workers of this history,
though hardly to be received as received wisdom (of that we can be
certain), might go a long way toward clearing the air some...

or maybe not!...

best,

Wow--now there have been two intelligent responses to
the question as to what language poetry is, although this
definition is too general for my taste.  I know, I know--
poetry, like jazz, is just too wonderfully above the mundane to be definable
except in the mute hearts of
those supra-rationally in tune with Existence.

I dealt with this in a meditation published last year.  Any radical deviation
from traditional/conventional poetic devices might have a problem in this
area.  A mixed metaphor, for instance, can be spotted in the classroom, on
the page.  A judgment can be rendered objectively whether or not the poem in
question has "made it."  But eschewing such devices, a poem (or a poetry)
likely depends on consensus for its worth.  In the case of Langpo this is
especially ironic.  Consensus drives the marketplace.  Here we might very
well have a poetry, ostensibly at odds with Capitalist/marketplace forces,
that nevertheless finds itself more dependent on them than are conventional
poetries.

There's another way to go at this, of course.  What we have is a movement
that is valued as such.  The individual poem is far less important and
central/centered than the methodology and underlying philosophy.  One
language poem is as good or bad as another since those value judgments do not
apply.  Critics find the movement innovative.  The originators are
celebrated, ergo their writing ascends, not because of its aesthetic merits,
but because it is valued as first.  Not an uncommon justification for the
shelf life of much avant-garde art throughout modern history.  Just a
thought.  Best, Bill

Which questions go back to pre the L=A=N=G=U=A=N=G=E  ERA...but they took it
up to their credit: indeed it might be...but not more productive....just
productive and probably some of the quests that initiated L=A= ...are
questions we need to be conscious (of course we are) but I mean we need to
make the effort constantly to "re-ask" those questions. In oter words: we
need , I feel, to constantly reinvent - in new ways - the wordy
wheel...Richard.

Subject:      More Meditations
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I write these "meditations" from time to time in an attempt to stay
sane.  While you ponder "LANGUAGE," I have been pondering the corruption of
language.  If you find these meditations tedious, apply the magic of
"delete."  If you want
to share them with others, feel free to do so.

More Meditations in a time of delusions and lies:

An opinion piece by former President Jimmy Carter appeared in the New York
Times (Sunday, April 21) in which he called for a viable Palestinian state,
and set out fairly detailed aspects of reasonable terms for a peace
settlement.  This indicates that not every member of the political elite is
utterly enthralled by the maximalist Israeli colonialist agenda.  It's too
bad that he couldn't be so bold at the time of the Camp David Accords, nor
could he prevent his emissary to the United Nations Andrew Young from
getting fired for merely speaking with the PLO representative in the
hallway of the UN.  Oh, the outrage at the time for even talking!

In his article, Carter explains that he restrained Menachem Begin from his
incursion into Lebanon, although he failed to mention that Begin kept none
of his promises to dismantle West Bank and Gaza settlements or slow their
pace of construction.  Critics of Camp David at the time said that the
agreement merely allowed Israel to turn to its north and invade Lebanon,
which it did soon after Reagan came to power, hoping to destroy the PLO,
create a Christian state with its Falangist allies to be a partner with the
Jewish state, and perhaps even keep control of Lebanon up until the Litani
River (which some early Zionist maps had proposed would be the northern
boundary of the Jewish state), or at least control the precious water
resources.  After so much blood, that scheme failed.

In any case, now all the newscasters and pundits on TV say that, of course,
there should be a Palestinian state.  Those of us who called for a
Palestinian state 20 years ago -- at the time Sharon was killing tens of
thousands of Lebanese and Palestinians -- were routinely labeled
anti-Semites, self-hating Jews, or terrorists.  Times change, and all of a
sudden something is "obvious" -- but, again, only after so much blood, and
supporters of peace and Palestinian rights can now be called names for
other reasons.  Of course, what someone means by a "state" is not so
certain.  Clearly, Sharon would like to see a museum, a tiny bantustan, or
an Indian reservation to which tourists could be taken to see the charming
relics of an earlier era before Jewish settlement brought "civilization" to
the land.  Of course, everyone wants a Palestinian state . . .

In the same issue of the New York Times, a front-page article discusses a
new pro-Israel bloc in the Republican Party involving an alliance of
Zionists and Christian conservatives who support Sharon (Bush's "man of
peace") for religious reasons, believing that Israel has a covenant with
God.  In their view, that particular contract stipulates that Jews get the
land, and everyone else has to go.  All such support revolves around
elaborate apocalyptic scenarios, fantasies that involve the great
Armaggeden war that, incidentally, will end up killing almost all the Jews
in Israel (along with much of the rest of the world) in order for Jesus to
return.  Nobody likes to be incorporated into someone else's religious
fantasies, but as a Jew (or as a human) I don't appreciate supposed support
for Jews that actually involves a vision of my own death.  Menachem Begin
didn't have that problem, however.  In the early eighties, he gave a gold
medal (the Jabotinsky Award) to Rev. Jerry Falwell to honor his support of
Jews and the State of Israel.  I'm sure the Zionist leadership then and now
don't think much of the religious scenario -- the goyem are crazy -- but
they are wily enough to take support even from Protestant fundamentalists
who endanger the freedoms of Jews and everyone else in America.

Apocalyptic fantasies can be self-fulfilling.  The invasion of the West
Bank is only the first act.  The invasion of Gaza awaits.  Nor should
anyone put it past Sharon, adventurist that he is, to provoke a wider,
regional war, one which pits the US and Israel against the entire Arab and
Muslim world.  In this regard, he has help from elements within the
American power elite, those who yearn with such tremendous blood lust to
attack Iraq.  Once that attack begins, Sharon can go ahead in murdering
more Palestinians, complete his dream of "transfer," and assure Israel's
dominance over the entire region, while the world is distracted by perhaps
an even bloodier massacre.  Yes, "obviously," everyone wants a Palestinian
state . . .

So, we have apocalyptic Christians who seek to "facilitate" prophecy,
prodding the US to join Israel in a bloody war, while apocalyptic Zionists
seek to expand colonial settlements through increasing violence because
they believe God made a promise to them.  Meanwhile, we are supposed to be
shocked by apocalyptic Muslims who adopt the same mentality?  An Arab poet
800 years ago said it succinctly: "Too much religion; not enough brains."

So, thank you Jimmy Carter, Baptist that you are, for trying to be
reasonable.  It's a quarter of a century too late, but it's better than
nothing.

Dear Friends,

This review of Los Angeles poet and fiction writer, Martin Nakell, =
appeared
in The Review of Contemporary Fiction (Spring 2002) in a piece by Steve
Tomasula. The book, published as EL-E-PHANT/Green Integer 52, is =
available
to folks on this list for a 20% discount. The book, originally priced at =
$16.95, is
now $13.56 plus $1.50 for postage and handling, which comes to a total =
of $15.06.
Please send checks or money orders made out to El-E-PHANT to Green =
Integer,
6026 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90036.

The phrase novel of ideas doesn't exactly apply to Martin Nakell's =
thoughtful Two Fields That Face and Mirror Each Other because of the =
nineteenth-century baggage evoked by the term. And yet some similar =
description, say conceptual art in the shape of a book, surely applies. =
Though there is a plot (sort of a family saga in which Grey leaves his =
lover Gloriana back in New York to visit a familly farm in Michigan and =
attend the funeral of George, a friend's son, who kidnapped and killed =
his stepbrother before committing suicide), the plot is the least of it. =
Indeed, the novel is strongest when it functions less like Stendhal's =
mirror traveling down the road of life and more like textual art on the =
subject of identity: a weave of meditative sections in which, for =
example, Grey sitting on a porch in Michigan and watching the repetitive =
work of a farmer preparing a crop is counterpointed with Gloriana's =
observation of the emotional cycles that a "tribe" of stock traders goes =
through trying to predict wheat prices--just one manifestation of the =
many fields that face and mirror each other. As the characters struggle =
with a plethora of dichotomies, e.g. how family values in Michigan can =
translate into the legal defense of a man known guilty of murder in New =
York, the novel looks deeper into these mirrors facing mirrors until we =
are considering the nature of narratiave itself. And this may be the =
most convincing aspect of the novel: a demonstration that just when you =
think it's all been done in the novel, a novel of ideas can still =
reflect its own rich traditions even as it mirrors them in ways that are =
meaningful to our contemporary cultural field, where neither people nor =
institutions can be explained by naive looking. (Steve Tomasula, The =
Review of Contemporary Fiction)

it was just a random thought but maybe there's a glimmer in it?  in my
perception LP began, at least in some ways, as an examination with the
poetry that existed at he time and wasn't "working"  along with language
(scientific, commercial, 'philosophical') that wasn't "working".

For the most part "attacks" on LP in my perception have been a combination
of defensive protection of the status quo and envious wannabe and this ends
in a circular dichotomy.

atthe same time over the years since LP's "birth" there are signs of a need
for and acceptance of altered perceptions in both spheres so the question
for me is whether it might not be more productive to examine the spheres
separately (not necessarily in isolation from each other)?

For example in the language sphere it is becoming increasingly clear that in
medicine, for example, the old mind/body way of thinking  (body/mind more
appropriately) doesn't cut it any moreand this has progressed to such a
degree that establishment gastroenterologists have begun to doubt Descarte.
This is a rather specialized instance but I think there are others and the
questiob for me is does LP offer them anything?  i suspect it does but
haven't figured it out.

In the poetics sphere  a similar phenomenon is in processbut it might be
more productively examined in at least semi-isolation from the language and
philosophical stuff.

i know thie suggestion is anathema to the LP 'pioneers' who wed the two
spheres in the first place but I think it merits consideration and
discussion?

Inside the river of poetry
by Louis Reyes Rivera


         Always there is need for song. And every human has a poem to write, a
compulsion to contemplate out loud, an urge to dig out that ore of confusion
locked up inside. But with the contradictions of privilege and caste, of
class and gender distinctions regulating access, of those ever present
distortions in textbooks with their one-sided measure of human worth, and
with the culture of white man still serving as ultimate yardstick to what is
acceptable as matter, not everyone is permitted to learn to read, much less
to study poetry or hone the art and take the risk of putting one's self on
paper.
         While wanting to be naturally soothed by self-definition, too many
among us learn to rely on commercial lyricists to reflect our joy and pain.
At best, we latch onto committed activists who take on as social vocation the
work of bridging the human spirit with word made flesh. At worst, we fall
prey to professional wordsmiths (politicians and preachers alike) who conjure
up another religion that dissuades us from social contention. Somewhere in
between these two extremes, we sometimes meet and break a moment's bread with
poets.
         Today, what was once called poetry is now Spoken Word Art. Unlike the
Rappers who have Hip Hopped twenty-syllable couplets into a steadfast beat,
Spoken Word Artists have returned to free verse oration exhilarated by
internal rhyme schemes and unfettered metaphors that speak directly to inner
city blues. The news of the day, testament and affirmation, current and
advanced, informs this form of poetry that outlines the immediate and
understudied aspirations of African and Latino Americans caught in the
crossfire between skin game caste and an ever shrinking planet of high tech
advances.
         Desk top publishing, internet websites, tea parties and Open Mic
readings, marathon jams and poetry slams have combined to form the latest
battlesites between truth and decadence. Inside the range of this contention
are the new poets being pulled by and pushing against a state of confusion in
search of clarity.
         Their names are many and they come from everywhere, like Jamaican Dub
Poets in Germany and England, or Nuyorican Poets in Texas and the Bronx. To
single out the more notoriously known here as comprising the new heat (like
Tony Medina, Asha Bandele, Jessica Care Moore, Nzinga Chavis, Saul Williams,
UniVerses, 2nd To Last, Ras Baraka), without qualification, is to commit the
same crime as today's textbooks: taking a single droplet or two out of a
river and making out like two droplets are the actual river itself. For just
as each drop of water helps to form a river, each name dropped is but a
metaphor for the many others who came before or right alongside those whose
work forms our current popular canon.
         Poetry, you see, is as old as breath itself. For when human beings
across the planet simultaneously uttered that first initial sound, they gave
rise to the same echo heard in the wail of every newborn child. The sound of
that cry might be onomatopoeic, but its meaning is quite literal. "I am here,
now!" This is the essential affidavit that serves as testament inside every
person's compulsion to give voice to the voice, as condition urges vision,
vision provokes thought, and  thought pronounces the name of God: "I matter,
too!"
         Thus the birth of the word, the root of every language. Poetry. The
strength of the people. The finest manifestation of craft, content and intent
in every written and oral expression. The basis upon which all other literary
genres have evolved. >From poetry, not only the lyric, but as well drama and
narrative, the expository and the thematic, the didactic and the ideological
as root to all our scripture, sacred and profane.
         It began as a blending of sound (the rhythm), sense (the experience),
and color (the given image). A voice raised in celebration of itself. Chant
and dance, music and tone, mystery and miracle forged into the embodied
literature of people passing it on, by speech and sight, to each subsequent
generation, asking and answering the fundamental question: How do we live?
And is that the same as how we want to live or what we mean when we say
there's something we're supposed to do?
         The Chinese call it The Way; the Buddhist, Enlightenment; the Hindu,
Nirvana; the Muslim, Complete Submission to the Will of Allah; the
Egyptian-Judeo-Christian, Seeking the Light; and among many Africans and
Amerindians it was once referred to as Being At One With Life. And from the
poets among them, it is that inner compulsion to Follow the Muse. They speak
to the same cause, challenging the inner voice to maintain balance between
flesh, thought, action. Thus, Poet as author of scripture and Griot as Keeper
of a Narrative. Each generation, regenerated by its own voices has, since the
first word heard, added to that tapestry of affirmation. In Egypt and
throughout the Americas, they called it Song; in Israel, Psalms; in West
Africa, Nommo; and in Greece, Poetry.
         It knows no borders. Unrestricted by or to genre, gender, nation,
race, time or class. For in the need to contemplate, inside the compulsion to
sing, and as Gylan Kain says, "to give voice to the deeper meaning of
ourselves," poets learn to look upon love, life, struggle both as
interchangeable terms and as the only limitations self-imposed. This is why
poets are never invited to participate in televised forums, roundtable
discussions and panels with other writers and speakers, journalists,
politicians, social activists, academics, religious leaders. You never know
what the poet will say.
         This is also why poetry is considered the most dangerous art form,
why it is not honestly taught and thoroughly nurtured into our youth in the
schools, among our adults in the factories and fields, inside our homes,
churches, offices. It cannot be diluted, bought, sold, compromised or traded
without treason to its beauty, its necessity, its meaning. The poet learns to
care about every word.
          What we often view as a national literature is but one of many
rivers coursing its way into the ocean of all our knowledge. In the general
sense of world literature, we're supposed to bear in mind the ocean into
which every river flows; with the particular local canon, however, we are
actually cheated from studying all those droplets comprising both rivers and
streams (the ethnic and the national), despite the fact that without them,
there'd be no water to feed into that ocean.
         Sad to say that too many of today's Spoken Word Artists lack an
understanding of their own context. So focused on the immediacy of their own
moment of breath, they are not as well studied into the history and evolution
of this artform for the vocation that it is. In short, they have not really
read or been taught to engage the works of those who came before them. And
so, this contributive note regarding the river of our poetry.
         African American poetry is not restricted to the United States. It is
an hemispheric phenomenon as old as the dirge and the moan heard inside those
first slave ships bound for the slave-breaking islands of the Caribbean, to
Hispaniola and Mexico, long before they landed in Virginia. In the U.S.,
where drums were outlawed, it manifested as folklore, Spirituals and the
Blues; in the Caribbean as Plena (Barbados), Bomba (Puerto Rico), Ska
(Jamaica), with conga and steel drums, as with Merengue (Haiti) Mambo (Cuba)
Calypso (Trinidad), like Samba (Brazil).
         With European influences setting up the parameters over form and
acceptability, here or there the poem was separated from music. Thus, slave
narratives grew into novels and African poetry in the Americas often took on
the semblance of European meter, pace and nuance (a la Phyllis Wheatley).
         Today's reading rooms, soirees and poetry jams are hardly a new
tradition, as they can be consistently traced back to 1888, the year that
marked the end of American chattel slavery and the beginning of Negritude
(both in Brazil) --during which period the children and grandchildren of
slaves and runaways begin their careers as writers searching for new
definition (like Charles Chestnut in fiction, Paul Lawrence Dunbar in poetry,
and W.E.B. DuBois as researcher and social critic).
         Of course, freedmen were writing long before then. North American
(John Russworm, David Walker, Frederick Douglass, Martin Delaney, William
Wells Brown) and Caribbean writers (Placido, Eugenio Maria de Hostos, Ramon
Emeterio Betances, Lola Rodriguez de Tio, Jose Marti) had been laying out a
foundation for a literary African/American thought. But it is after 1888 that
a genuine and continuing renaissance begins, as it now included all of the
descendants of former slaves learning to define themselves on paper. Thus,
Rag and the Blues as immediate metaphor for the thousands of artists in
places like Memphis, New Orleans, Chicago, Santiago de Cuba, Le Cap and
Harlem, who helped initiate a composite rebirth of African art spreading
across the face of America, sometimes rolling like a teardrop, other times in
denial of itself, but always from the spirit of intellect shaping its own
voice.
         By the 1920s and early '30s, social struggle and a budding aesthetic
had converged throughout the colonial world. Political movements (unionism,
socialism, communism, anarchism, Pan-Africanism, nationalism, independence)
often intersected with a cultural counterpart (Creolism, Diepalism,
Negritude, the Harlem Renaissance). Cross-fertilizing. Like the largest
number of UNIA chapters during the Garvey years were in Louisiana and Cuba,
corresponding to the growth of a U.S. National Negro Renaissance and a Cuban
Negrismo movement also taking place. Each in their own way stood against
European imperialism while uncovering the parameters of self-definition.
         As with the many African and Latino American poets practicing the art
today, the list of folks involved back then is endless. In addition to
critics, researchers and activists, like Ida B. Wells, William Monroe
Trotter, Carter G. Woodson, Richard B. Moore, Alain Locke, J.A. Rogers, Zora
Neale Hurston, W.E.B. DuBois, and with people like Arturo Alfonso Schomburg
serving as natural bridge between the English, Spanish, French diasporic
communities, the poets themselves comprised a river of personnel: Pablo
Neruda, Luis Pales Matos, Jose de Diego, Nicolas Guillen, Juan Antonio
Corretjer, Julia de Burgos, Clemente Soto Velez, Alfredo Miranda Archilla,
Aime Cesaire, Leopold Sedor Senghor, Leon Damas, Countee Cullen, James Weldon
Johnson, Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, Sterling Brown, and so
many others who've not been as extensively published or read as these few.
But their collective impact ushered in new forms and a continuum of literary
stalwarts like Richard Wright, Margaret Walker Alexander, Gwendolyn Brooks,
James Baldwin, and John Oliver Killens. Killens, by the way, along with
historian John Henrik Clarke, co-founded the Harlem Writers Guild, the one
group that definitively bridged the Harlem Renaissance of the '20s/'30s with
the 1960s Black Arts Movement and the 1970s Nuyorican Poetry Phenomenon.
         Those who workshopped alongside Killens, in or out of the Guild,
include at least two generations of dramatists (Lonnie Elder III, Loften
Mitchell, Charles Russell, Douglas Turner Ward, Ossie Davis), fiction writers
(Alice Childress, Rosa Guy, Piri Thomas, Maya Angelou, Louise Merriwhether,
Sarah E. Wright, Richard Perry, Doris Jean Austin, Brenda Connor-Bey,
Elizabeth Nunez Harrell, Nicholasa Mohr, Brenda Wilkerson, Arthur Flowers),
poets and lyricists (Mari Evans, BJ Ashanti, Askia Muhammad Toure, Mervyn
Taylor, Thulani Davis, Ntozake Shange, Fatisha, and Irving Burgie --the one
who wrote most of the British Caribbean songs that first made Harry Belafonte
famous).
         With the Black Arts Movement, the proverbial Pushkin spark turned
into flame as the 1966 National Black Writers Conference at Fisk University
(organized by Killens) gave cognizance to what had already been taking place;
thus we have the new poet-theoreticians, like Amiri Baraka and Larry Neal,
Askia Toure, Ishmael Reed, Audre Lorde, Henry Dumas, alongside new critics,
like Addison Gayle and Hoyt Fuller, new venues, like Umbra, Cannon Reed &
Johnson, or the Watts Writers Workshop, through which Jayne Cortez and Quincy
Troupe had developed their skills, or like Detroit-based Dudley Randall,
through whose publishing efforts began the careers of Haki Madhubuti, Carolyn
Rodgers, Sonia Sanchez. Like The Last Poets, many of them were as influenced
by Malcolm X as by Martin Luther King, Langston Hughes, Margaret Walker, Paul
Robeson and DuBois.
         By the late 1960s, Victor Hernandez Cruz, Jesus Papoleto Melendez and
Felipe Luciano became the latest spanning between African American and Puerto
Rican literature that had been previously bridged by the likes of Schomburg,
Guillen and Jesus Colon. As the 1970s took off, a Nuyorican mix began its own
sidestream fruition to both African American and Puerto Rican orthodoxy.
Spanglish took its place beside AfroAmericanese as a new idiom, with poets
Miguel Algarin, Lorraine Sutton, Americo Casiano, Miguel Pinero, Sandra Maria
Esteves, Julio Marzan, Lucky Cienfuegos, Roberto Marquez, Jose Angel
Figueroa, Tato Laviera, Noel Rico, Magdalena Gomez, Susana Cabanas and Pedro
Pietri serving as initial progenitors to another poetic sensibility. Its
availability and earned place has often been hindered by Anglo arrogance and
Hispanophilia, caught, as these poets were, between an evolving
aesthetic-in-exile influenced by Ebonics on the mainland and an active
insular and extremely cultural nationalism in Puerto Rico that at first
refused to even recognize this hybrid created out of U.S. colonialism.
         During this same period, from the late 1960s straight into the 1980s,
the tradition of small press and self-publishing (traceable to the 1730s,
when Europe began allowing colonies to own printing presses) had expanded
into roughly 1,000 independent magazines and publishing outlets under the
influence or control of African and Latino Americans: Freedomways, Journal of
Black Poetry, Hambone, Callaloo, Literati Chicago, The Rican Journal, Third
World Press, Third Press, Quinto del Sol, Black Classics Press, Yardbird
Reader, Mango Publications, Arte Publico Press, Black World/First World,
Poettential Unlimited, Shamal Books, Bola Press, Kitchen Table Press, Single
Action Productions, Blind Beggar Press, Drum Voices Revue, Harlem River
Press, just to name a few.
         Thus, sandwiched between the Black Arts Movement and the rise of Hip
Hop is a linking generation of African and Latino American poets, producers
and publishers who had come into their own (and many of them by the
mid-1970s) to serve as the latest bridge connecting the continuum of an
hemispheric African American literary canon. These were the students of
Malcolm and Martin and H. Rap Brown, entering the new decade with their own
resolve, reading, performing and organizing everywhere: in prisons, community
centers, cafes, in homes and on the streets, at Kwanzaa festivals and Malcolm
X commemoration programs, at political rallies and in the schools. These
sidestream stalwarts, most abundant in places like New York, were the
immediate parents of those who would later become Rap and Spoken Word (Chuck
D., Reg E. Gaines, Bruce George) Artists.
         They had entered the '70s knowing that the major publishing outlets
had already slammed its doors on Black Literature. Thus, they became the
generation that had proliferated the publishing world with their own
gumption, giving rise to, if not solidifying the careers of an Alice Walker,
a Toni Morrison and an Ntozake Shange. Poets-publishers-organizers who did
the basework while working a 9-to-5, raising a family, studying and
performing their craft. In New York City alone, these included Yusef Waliyaya
from The East's African Street festivals, John Branch from the Afrikan Poetry
Theatre, Rich Bartee of Poettential Unlmtd., Lois Elaine Griffith of the
Nuyorican Poets Cafe, George Edward Tait of the Afrikan Functional Theatre,
Gary Johnston and C.D. Grant of Blind Beggar Press, Layding Kaliba now with
African Voices, Barbara Smith of Kitchen Table Press, Abu Muhammad of Nubian
Blues magazine, Glen Thompson of Harlem River Press. From them and through
them, such poets as Safiya Henderson-Holmes, Akua Lezli Hope, Zizwe Ngafua,
Dawad Philip, B.J. Ashanti, Ted Wilson and many others previously mentioned
either began or continued finding outlets for their works to appear in print.
         Meanwhile, music and poetry never did finalize the divorce
Euro-Americans insisted upon. Not only were Hughes and Hurston experimenting
with the "jazz poem" and the intonations of northern and southern folklore
back in the 1930s, but from the BeBop and Afro-Cuban Jazz era straight
through to the present Rap/Spoken Word epoch, musicians and poets have
consistently uncovered the African tradition of incorporating sound and sense
into a wholistic art form. Literature, music and dance. Louis Armstrong, Sun
Ra, Charlie Mingus, King Pleasure, Slim (Gailliard) & Slam (Stewart), Alvin
Ailey had all eloquently continued that course. Singers Eddie Jefferson, Jon
Hendricks, Oscar Brown, Jr., and, of course, Nina Simone, had long ago fused
poetry into the jazz voice (Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit was actually a
poem someone had given her).
         Of equal significance is the immediate link to Rap and Spoken Word,
musicians Weldon Irvine, Ahmed Abdullah and Oliver Lake, like their literary
counterparts, The Last Poets, Jayne Cortez, Sekou Sundiata, Tom Mitchelson,
Yusef Waliyaya, Cheryl Byron, Atiba Kwabena Wilson, Ngoma Hill, each in their
turn, have preceded Sharif Simmons, UniVerses, 2nd To Last, etc., in fusing
the poem with the idioms of music and dance.
         And so the insistence that music and word are inseparable elements to
the voice raising up and rising up comes full circle inside the currents of
modern poetics. It's part of an ongoing continuum in constant evolution, an
unfinished renaissance establishing its own parameters on its own terms. Like
Sterling Brown once posed, "If it took Europe 300 years to unfold its
renaissance, what makes you think that we can do it in six?"
         And while it is homegrown North American, it is also cross-rooted in
an African and Caribbean experience.

POG

internships

POG (Poetry Group) is a collective of writers, artists, publishers,
professors, students, and others engaged in promoting the avant-garde art
scene in Tucson.  At present POG^Òs principal activity is Poetry in Action, a
public art event series committed to crossing boundaries.  Poetry in Action
events, at such sites as Dinnerware Gallery, Orts Dance Theatre, and Las
Artes Studios, typically pair a poet with a visual or musical artist, a
local writer or artist with a visiting one, and a well-known figure with a
younger, emergent one.

POG interns will work on several facets of POG^Òs programming (mostly for
Poetry in Action), possibly including:
--contacting visiting poets and other visiting artists and arranging the
details of their visits
--working with POG members to put together a comfortable visit for our
visiting artists (who are typically in Tucson for 2-3 days)
--spending some time with visiting artists while they are in Tucson (as part
of our ^Óhosting^Ô activities)
--helping with site set up and event logistics
--helping to organize the annual benefit fund-raising dinner
--working on the bi-annual POG anthology
--helping to locate possible sources of additional funding for POG (grants,
corporate sponsors)
--helping to put together publicity materials

During FALL and SPRING semesters POG will likely have two student interns.
One SUMMER internship will also be available.

It^Òs not necessary for all interns to work on all the above activities.  So
if you^Òre interested in some of them but not all, it^Òs still worth applying.

It would be very helpful for at least one intern to possess the following
computer-related skills and requisite technology:
ability to receive and send email ^Óattachments^Ô (attached document files)
from home computer (this can^Òt currently be done from a ^Óu.arizona.edu^Ô
account)
--ability to work with files in Microsoft Office 2000 format (especially
Word, Excel, and Access)
--regular internet access
--ability to do basic layout for fliers and brochures.

Interns are not paid but receive academic credit through the UA English
Department.

i first encountered language poetry though an understanding of it as a
conceptual and formal de-investment of the referent, words no longer pointed
to things, only to more words, prisonhouse, panopticon, etc...  and as a
critique of capitalist tendencies in the hierarchical/hegemonic structure of
language and logic, the ownership of meaning.  this is most likely a
ballpark estimation, however i think most of these answers about LP are
correct.  one place LP fails is in terms of content.  language as material
for content starts to produce the similar types of writing which many have
picked up on and imitated.  i know i was guilty of it.  the method of
investigation though, and the questions LP asked of language, are good ones
for anyone writing poetry, whether or not they agree with the practitioners,
praxis, of the writers doing the asking.

just another two cents.

Gastroenterologists, you're saying, can't swallow Descartes? But can they
swallow the horse?

Language poetry as an entity was established by a bunch of very young poets
who were still very close to the classroom, hence, I think, their critical
vocabulary.  It would have been difficult at the time to find a lot of
poets who were not, say, of the Auden to Wilbur to Plath lineage who would
have disagreed too strongly with "...we have emphasized a spectrum of
writing that  places its attention primarily on language and ways
of  making meaning, that takes for granted neither  vocabulary, grammar,
process, shape, syntax, program,  or subject matter..."  I was there bat
the time, and a bit older than most of the first self-identified Language
Poets. It's not a bad thing banding together to market one's poetry, and
that's what most group identities are fore, whether it's the Pleiade, the
sureealists or the objectivists, but it might be good to remember that
that's one of the primary functions of such groupings, although the young,
narcissistic as we all tend to be at that age, sometimes do forget this.
What's important is not the identification but the quality, and no amount
of critical apparatus can take its place. And several of those poets were
and became very fine poets indeed, and poets from whom younger poets learn.
But for the life of me I can't see in the poetry itself a unifying thread
running through the entire group that differentiates them from the rest of
non-mainstream (as defined above) practice in any consistent way. They're
just too different from each other and too much a part  of a much larger
collection.

OK, back to my hole.

Mark

I always link of the language® poets as the crowd who published in
l=a=n=g=u=a=g=e,  just like the poetry project crowd or the sulfur crowd who
published in their respective publications ...convivial fraternal assemblages.

anyone by any chance have the citation for the village voice review of
clark coolidge's crystal text and solution passage that appeared
subsequently on the back cover blurb for sound as thought? the review
reads in part: "Either of these books by itself would be a peak; to be

Actually this is real,  The story is in _Gut_ last year I think.  _Gut is

Since I rarely read poetix in a linear sense
I took Ron S's quote of the WCW poem
as something to do with the notion of
considering what is in front of you
rather than a transpositon of something
onto the subject. Which in my horizontal
lifters meant, yea, the transformation of
the outer to represent a hollow inner which
directly related to Juliana's thing about
nature. Call it rotation about the gyre of human
attributes, whatever.

Then I was interested in the shifting of the sonnet
form to express a different form of love done by
Hathaway(?) in a poem I'd read, from Italian
to 6 / 8 for the stanzas, then instead of repeating
back forth in a soothing rhythm, the end ryhmes
should come to a head in the center like a joust.

E-mail is back up now.
I am not done, just behind.

as for the native american word im not really sure, but i do know that
sattva means 'being' in sanskrit... it may also be that the interpretation
may  be tibetan. they have a tendency to infuse various contextual
ritualistic meanings into simpler terms sanskrit words...
sattva is pronounces svaha...
the sanskrit  'vajra' is a good starting point to investigate the thunder
lightening analogy. hope that helps

[attrib. to Dineh (Navajo); provenance unverified] "The time between when
you see the lightning and when you hear the thunder." Useful to describe
those svaha moments when you know exactly what will happen in the next few
seconds but have no way to change it. It's the feeling you have when you're
at a very fancy dinner party with heirloom wineglasses on the table and you
turn and feel your elbow nudge something...

I don't know about other languages. but...

In Sanskrit [Sanscrit if you are old, and rather French], there is a ritual
cry svaahaa [-aa- representing a long -a-].  It punctuates many Vedic ritual
moments [e.g., sacrifices], and basically functions as a mantra.  We don't
know the etymology and precise sense of this word.  The best bet is that it
means something like "hail, power to you."  So it doesn't really mean "the
time between seeing the lightning and hearing the thunder" -- although it
might be something that one might say during such a time.

I'm curious to know where you got the idea that it meant this.

I don't want to be so quick to dismiss such "journalistic worrying," because
I think it is also a _practical_ worrying: that is, a worrying centered
around praxis in a given community, or in a set of possible communities
awaiting determination.  One effect of Langpo has certainly been to make
this issue of community's relation to (individual) praxis more crucial than
ever, and to make concerns such as How to Explain a Given Poetics to the
Uninitiated very relevant concerns.  Thus, I don't think even a basic
question like "what is Langpo" can ever be reduced to a "null point," even
if the same reductions and distortions are inevitably rehearsed in the
ongoing head-scratching and mumbled replies.  Of course there is going to be
dumb repetition and wrongheaded misprision, but that's always part of any
extended polylogue.  In fact, I wonder if we don't _need_ the noise and
static as an essential element of the social demonstration performed by
language-centered writing's reception, transmission, and recycling: if its
"tenets" were ever received as transparent, final dicta or definitions, this
would suggest that one should be able to go back and "translate" the work to
reveal where exactly such ultimate interpretations and prescriptions were
encoded.  Barrett, it seems to me that that's similar to what you're saying
in saying "styles and descriptions ... don't just fragment into the same
problem of language or signification."  The way I read much Langpo, it is
far too indebted to the ludic methods of earlier movements like NYS,
surrealism, etc., to be fragmented (collapsed?) in that way.  (And I'm aware
that to make such a connection goes against the implicit or explicit claims
of some of the founding fathers/mothers that Langpo signals a _break_ with
what they see as the anti-intellectual, anti-analytic principles behind
those earlier movements, but I see it nonetheless.)

I'll get back to the "concrete positions"--at least one of them--but first,
I find myself unable to read fully between the lines of your assessment of
this "collective crisis": are you saying it's a pointless crisis to be
having? or are you saying that it's a genuine cause for concern, but that
people are going about addressing it in the wrong ways? or something else
entirely?  I think the difficulty I'm having in gauging _affect_ here is the
most frequent aporia I encounter in reading your criticism generally
(including "Secret History"), which may be part of your intention, and which
in fact is part of what makes your criticism fascinating to me: that
emotional impenetrability.  Or even _positional_ impenetrability.  So my
asking you this question may be very naive, like asking Shandu to explain
where the rabbit comes from (or disappears to).  But you must see that one
big reason that people continue the debate as though you had "never said a
blessed thing" is that the "concreteness" of your position is nowhere near
as obvious as you would have it!  It's been a few months since I looked at
"Secret History" carefully, but _is_ there really an "answer" to the
question in question there?  I remember it as being more about the nature of
collaboration and community politics than about what distinguishes Langpo
per se.  I'm not saying it _should_ be about the latter, but in terms of
your comments on the list, you sound like you're suggesting that the
elements for a substantial grounding are contained therein.  I haven't read
Ben's article, but will find myself a copy.

You do ask a question that I think is valid and important: why don't the
many published accounts out there enter into these discussions more often?
Two possible answers come to mind.  One is that the nature of academic
critical circulation is such that people--especially people not affiliated
with any university that has a good library--often only come into contact
with these materials in dribs and drabs if at all.  The web is changing
this, of course, but there is still some restriction of access to key texts
involved here.  Second, despite what I've just said, these arguments _do_
enter into the discussions, I think (and I assume we're talking about
positions published by people like McGann, Perloff, Hartley, Kim, Spahr,
etc.), albeit mixed and jumbled and filtered through people's all-too-human
and fallible memories of many years' worth of past reading.  If the list
were a refereed journal, the imprecision and abstraction would be more
alarming; but this is an _e-mail list_, and part of the attraction to such a
list, in my opinion, is that people can have something like the kind of
impromptu discussions they have in the hall with colleagues, students, and
teachers.  In such discussions, being off-book as it were, you get to see
how squishy human minds really process this stuff, in the soup, in the act
of daily living (or _fail_ to process it, which may be significant in
itself).  I'd wager that many (tho not all) people who ramble on the list
will produce very cogent and well-documented positions when writing in a
more formal context.  Obviously that's where you want to go for obsessive
consistency, inclusiveness, and retention; here, isn't the idea just to get
a forum going?  Of course, just like at a "real" forum, there's always
someone like you who speaks up and demands intellectual integrity, so....

And once again, I share your frustration at the way what should be exhausted
topics have to be rehearsed again and again and again.  But I suspect that
with every recycling, some nuance emerges that might not have been visible
before, and there are people coming to this topic for the first time who can
never come at from exactly the same perspective as those who were in on the
inception.  Movements get blurry over time, and what might now seem like an
imperfect distortion of an original idea may actually be the necessary
diffusion of past occurrences through a present lens--"necessary" both in
the sense of "inevitable tho regrettable," and in the sense of "needed in
order to make some timely adjustment."  That may sound like an idealistic
apology for weak theorizing, but I don't think it is entirely.

But after all that, yes--how about it?  Is there a comprehensive
bibliography available anywhere?  In Ben's article, perhaps?  On the EPC
site?

I believe the reviewer's name was Geoffrey O'Brien -- who is not, I
think, the same Geoffrey G. O'Brien who recently published a book of
poems in UC's New California Poets series. It's been a while since I've
seen his byline in the Voice, though, so you might want to check with
someone who has less of a hearsay relationship to the archive.

Subject:      "Language Poetry is"...?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Language poetry is the biggest trend I see, experimental writing.

Language poetry is a movement of convincing authority in contemporary
poetics.  Language poetry is held out to be one of the poetic modes of the
present moment.  Language poetry is about going beyond the boundaries of
traditional / conventional language usage.

Language poetry is one in which there is a number of established poets
operating in diverse ways.  Language poetry is diverse, including a
selection of poems by women.

Language poetry is in its heyday.  The galvanizing force has been the
regularly scheduled poetry.

Language poetry is impressive.  Language poetry is the highest form of
language.

Language poetry is not the entire solution to keeping the nation's language
clear and honest.

Language poetry is neither genre nor movement.  Language poetry is there as
a backdrop.

Language poetry is constructed as a niche market.  Language poetry is
academy-ready.  The founders of the Language movement were interested in
ideas.  Language poetry is also often seen as elitist because it never dealt
adequately with issues.  Language poetry is concerned, then, with what it is
to be radical in theory.

Language poetry is a puppet-show, where riders of skyrockets and divers of
sea fathoms....

Language poetry is a special type of language that attempts to express the
inexpressible.  It is not the pragmatic.

Language poetry is highly personal, intellectual and stylistically radical.
Language poetry is vibrant.  Language poetry is seen as political act in the
deepest sense.  This poetry is accessible to an American audience.

Language poetry is a way to make sense of the world.  I never really know
what I think.

Language poetry is more than this.  Language poetry also takes the form of
statement and declaration.  Language poetry is first of all speaking with
listening? a peculiar state that is somehow self.

Language poetry is a particularly American phenomenon that borrows from
European traditions and theories.

Language poetry is no harder to "get" than Cubism.

Language poetry is twenty years old.  Language poetry is blessed by Rosmarie
Waldrop.

Language poetry is a way of expression open to anyone who chooses to use it.
  Language poetry is central to existence, to the real lives of real people.
  Language poetry is the passion of language and children enjoy that as
well.

Language poetry is the language for expressing emotions, as we know.

Language poetry is about making language happen.  Language poetry is
redemptive.

Language poetry is what gets lost in translation.  Language poetry is not an
attempt to obscure meaning through ambiguity.  Language poetry is, as
Stevens put it, the difference between the and an.

Language poetry is Jacob's ladder for me: a place where earth and spirit
connect.  Language poetry is our basic connection between our sense of self
and the cosmos.

Language poetry is in for one helluva ride, I would think!

Language poetry is more visual in Chinese and Japanese than it is oral.

Language poetry is often intended to be read on the page, but there are many
poems.

Language poetry is undoubtedly the most self-critical--in the sense of self
promotion.

Language poetry is also better than prose at shaping small subjects to
create intimate feeling.  Language poetry is much more
philosophically-based, and I think my poems are still strongly rooted.

Language poetry is both concise and precise, two of the most important
elements.  Language poetry is best served when it attacks not language
itself (give me a good clause).

Language poetry is built of nothing but words, and must use what it finds to
hand.  Language poetry is wordplay, without the play.  Language poetry is
normally recited.

Language poetry is here, alive and blooming, but with a pop-culture
injection of speed.

Language poetry is a perfect way to describe the blurred understanding of
dreams.  Language poetry is how we word ourselves across rivers we never
crossed before.  Language poetry is an echo asking a shadow dancer to be a
partner.

Language poetry is autobiographical at its fundament, even if an attempt to
purge self.

Language poetry is about memory and shared experiences.  Language poetry, as
you probably know, is....

Language poetry is in 839.8137 and a Norwegian-language novel is in 839.82.

Language poetry is shit or that it is the shit--and no doubt that will be
educational.

Language poetry is tae hae its first owersettin intae Chinese.  Language
poetry is uniquely accessible to the speakers of that language.  Language
poetry is what survives translation, not what's lost in it.

Language poetry is, what would you say?  W: I don't think I would be able to
explain it.

Language poetry is a certain kind or quality of intellectuality, or seeming
intellectuality.  Language poetry is really thinking about a lot of the
poetry that one has probably read.

Language poetry is ordered by production rather than reproduction.  The
reader no longer reflects.

Language poetry is a recuperation by "literature" of something that was
questioning the poetic.

Language poetry is a performance art form involving signing rhythm and
movement.  Language poetry is about moving an audience with sound and image.
  Language poetry is the painting of the blind, while painting is the poetry
of the deaf.  Language poetry is always the one you can feel more
intensively.

Language poetry is a very high form of linguistic intelligence.  Language
poetry is considered centripetal because the author tries to infuse every
word.

Language poetry is a type of speech.  Second, song lyrics are poetry stolen
back from the dull.

Language poetry is a message ... a language of the old and the young.  The
language of the weak and the strong.  The language of patriots.

Language poetry is not designed basically to communicate information.
Language poetry is artistic noise: it resists the dreams of pure
communication.

Language poetry is written in verse; that is, the lamguage which makes up
the poem.  Language poetry is structured in short lines and verses. Most
appealing types of poetry are.  Language poetry is written in iambic
pentameters.  Language poetry is written mostly in iambic meters.  Language
poetry is iambic pentameter, in which unaccented and accented syllables
alternate in lines.  Language poetry is essentially rhythmic and usually
metrical, and it is frequently structured in stanzas.  Language poetry is an
art form that places a very high value on rhythm, rhyme, alliteration.
Language poetry is the syllable.  Most poetry in the English language is
based on accentual-syllabic meter.

Language poetry is subtly being replaced by the emotional difficulties of
the ambiguous and confrontational.

Language poetry is being explored and we are looking at the many techniques.
  Language poetry is the cutting edge of a sphere.  Language poetry is a
technology for memory and speed.

Language poetry is an art, and it is common for artists to disagree.

Language poetry is a particularly regular and effective tool for learning.
Topics are rich.  Language poetry is one way in which our pupils see words
coming to life.

Language poetry is the best I've found anywhere on the web.  Know it, use
it, love it.

Language poetry is the only poetry that is language, but the term has long
been used.  Language poetry is above all a concentration of the power of
language.  Language poetry is the essence and the power of language.  I
think all of us are poets.

Language poetry is quoted from other sources, the Writer gives new contexts
to material.

Language poetry is especially powerful.  I think the best way to understand
Language poetry is to meet some actual examples of it.

Language poetry is by no means a toy in the hands of foreign rulers.
Language poetry is available in English, for example, but it doesn't have
the same value.

Language poetry is special language.  Language poetry is influenced by
theory.

Language poetry is not just a catch phrase to describe the words used in
making poems.  Language poetry is more like a group.

Language poetry is poetry.  Actually, poets can't do it, either.  Unless you
believe Language poetry is poetry.

Language poetry is correlative to no object, including its own notion.

Language poetry is a term I prefer not to use.  Language poetry is not
"literature" and is not worth wasting parchment and ink on.  Language poetry
is odious, is hurtful; it hijacks the word language, which belongs to all.
Language poetry is misleading.  Language poetry is a self-defeating fiction.

Language poetry is one of the most ancient and widespread of the arts.

Language poetry is an experience of referral in the place of transparent
signification.

Language poetry is older than prose, and abstract speech more difficult.

Language poetry is a form of expression that allows our deepest soul to be
portrayed to others.  Language poetry is a way to say something in a way
that shows love and elevates that.

Language poetry is also fundamental because it speaks to the right content
through language.  What....

Language poetry is a transcendence of logical confinement.  A wonderful wine
poured into a bottle.  Language poetry is good for you--a bit like eating
healthy food.  Recap points to consider....

Language poetry is at once deep and humorous--deeply, often darkly,
humorous.

Language poetry is also provided.  Language poetry is also included.
According to Dr Puru Sharma, it is difficult to write poems.

Language poetry is the refusal to take for granted the tyranny of meaning.
Language poetry is waka.

Language poetry is not for everyone.  They place Language poetry as a gender
and class.

Language poetry is not as explicitly multi-authored as web networks are, the
expressive power of multiple context remains one of its main concerns.

Language poetry is language.  A sharp distinction in theory between rhyme
and meter.

Language poetry is an American phenomenon, not an Australian one. Explore
its possibilities.

Language poetry is usually presented in lines.  Often poets express a great
deal.

Language poetry is not a secondary phenomenon: it has a special relation to
being and truth.  Language poetry is here understood as simply one of the
functions that can be.  Language poetry is release (Gelassenheit).

Language poetry is understood to be an art of imitation: imitation with new
inflections.

Language poetry is flowing.  A philosopher is talking to you and yet you
just can not....

Language poetry is filled with this type language, but so is regular
language.  The dog loved....

Language poetry is lost, but meaning may become more accessible.  Her
luminous watercolors, as ever....

Of course, if you see the lightning first and then hear the thunder, it has
already happened.  Thunder is the confirmation.

So, it's true as John of Padua, the Renaissance scholar, observed, "sotto
voce...aha!"  Lightning doesn't speak, it shows.  This true meaning of the
ancient acronym, svaha, was re-discovered under the roses by Umberto Eco in
the late '40's, though he never really mentions it in much of his work,
save in the Hyperreality  material..and then only in a strange obscure
postscript.  Edmundis, in his Lexicon Lex, relates svaha to eureka (see
1 Grontius 80:37).

I'd like to go to some readings in New York while I'm in town and am hoping
people will backchannel me the information. My dates in NYC are April 26th
until  May 1st, and I'm back in New York again on May 8th until May 13th.

Subject:      a few thoughts
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I'll try to pull together a response to various threads in this ongoing
discussion.  I'm doing this mostly from memory after having read & deleted
many posts, so apologies if you feel I've misrepresented or misattributed
something you said.

I believe Laura Fargas asked whether anyone could articulate an aesthetic
for judging which L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poems are better than others.  I don't
believe anyone can, in part because I read the moves to politicize poetry's
formal apparatus & historicize its reception into a larger network of social
relations, as a rejection of aesthetic criteria as such.  (Or, the rejection
of aesthetic criteria as ~primarily~ important).  If you bracket off this
rejection & attempt to re-aestheticize that body of work, then Language
Poetry doesn't make much sense, or that is, retain the same relevance.

Yet the situation is a little more complicated than that.  In her post, the
absense of a criterion is linked to the old saw "I know what I like."  If
"knowing" what you like suggests an uncritical response, I'd say that it's
nearly impossible to have a coherent critical response to something as
omnipresent & generic-- in the sense of its academic & cultural reception--
as "Language Poetry" has become.  (Surely this was the impetus behind Kasey
Mohammed's playful post, or at least as I would read it).  On the other hand
if she had asked, can anyone articulate why _My Life_ (for example) remains
a worthwhile text, I'd bet she would have gotten dozens of thoughtful
replies.  Yet to turn the question on its head-- I'd like to know which of
us ~doesn't~ "know what she likes."  And which comes first-- the "liking" or
the critical response?  Who other than some poor graduate student would
invest more than a pale degree of energy & attention upon some work they
didn't care about?

Joe Amato says that L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry must still be very relevant, & as
evidence he points to all the recent posts on the subject.  Well I agree,
Joe, it's still relevant, but I'd also ask, is it the ~work~ that's relevant
to the one posting, or the idea of the work, or its reception in one form or
another.  I think that Bill Austin has the last word here, when he writes,
"Critics find the [LP] movement innovative.  The originators are celebrated,
ergo their writing ascends, not because of its aesthetic merits, but because
it is valued as first."  And who can argue with him, except perhaps to note
some of the poets, like MacLow, Coolidge, Cage, Spicer, Stein & Zukofsky,
who came before the firsts.  (And yes, I'm aware that it's not the same
thing as *valued* as first: a clever distinction, Bill).

I'm not trying to be skeptical here-- or if I am, it is not toward the
writers & writing grouped under the banner of "L=A=N=G=U=A=N=G=E Poetry,"
but rather toward what I'm calling here its academic & cultural reception.
Ultimately, Bill's analysis is irrefutable, while it also suggests that
what's most "relevant" to us may be the poetics of the Kings of the Hill.
One of the problems attendant with the Kings-of-the-Hill line of thought is
that it reinscribes the imperatives of economic & cultural forces we would
otherwise critique, but in this case shifts the marginally favored position
to some ironic heirs apparent.  Winner take all: well fortunately that's
~not~ it.  In the end, I like and most agree with mIEKAL's post-- just in
the sense of attending to the small l's, to READING outside the conditions
of institutional acceptance.  Poetry-- David Hess is right-- is larger than
these games; I wonder if any of us is able to articulate how & in what
sense.

Cheers,

Mark DuCharme

Interesting, but it rather pointedly ignores black poets who wrote in
"mainstream" poetic movements, or recent black poets who are published
rather than on the Spoken Word scene.  For example, to talk about caribbean
poets without mentioning Derek Walcott (one of the only poets to win a Nobel
prize who might have actually deserved it) is deliberately misleading--
shouldn't it be encouraging to caribbean or afro-americans that someone poor
from a small idsland (st. lucia) could go that far?   But Walcott is a very
classically educated poet, his big book is about the Odyssey, and it doesn't
fit what black poets (I guess) should be writing, even though it uses the as
characters the people of his island and their dialect and culture.  I think
the book, "Omeros," is amazing because it manages to be about Homer and be
very formal and fine-tuned and yet it paints a picture of a people we win
america can barely imagine, and seing the high passion amongst these
fishermen is a radical statement.

He could also have mentioned Komunykaa (but he's in the establishment,
teaches at Princeton, and his latest book "Talking Dirty to the Gods" is not
very Black), or Clarence Major (not black enough).

Then for the present there are a whole bunch of interesting poets, ones who
are interesting for various reasoins, many of whom do not "sound black" in
the way of the Spoken Word Poets (whom incidentally I like, and I go to the
Nuyorican sometimes to hear them) (but (and some who do-- most who do sound
black for the honest reason that they are writing poems about themselves and
people they know, who are black, not that they feel obliged to sound black.
Somehow I think some proponents of black literature want it to be a unified
thing with the same voice, viz, the black voice, which I don't understand.
White poets are allowed to sound different from each other-- why should all
black poets sound like Langston Hughes modernized?  Especially since Black
people sound totally different from each other (as one would expect), it is
strange to think they'd share a poetic voice.  They tend to at the Spoken
Word events, but that isn't because they are black poets, it is because the
Nuyoricans are a bit of a clique (as are, the language poets for that
matter) and to be successful on that scene you have to sound a certain way.

For example Thylias Moss' "Small Congregations" could be "of afro-american
interest" because it is a lot about her childhood and people she knew, but
there are hints she wants to be a poet, not a black poet who sounds white,
certainly not, but a poet who has her own language.  In "Last Chance for the
Tarzan Holler" you can't tell she is black, and I bought this book first and
indeed did not know she was black until I got to a poem at the end of the
book which is about a black girl being told she can't write a paper on the
Holocaust because it is none of her business and she can only write about
slavery.  Other examples of black poets who deserve to be read because they
are poets but aren't particularly "black" are Claudia Rankine and Haryette
Mullen.  I like Cornelius Eady, too, maybe he is more what Rivera has in
mind as a black poet, but I don't think so.  His latest book has to do with
a race issue (very imaginatively, it's not a nuyorican angry thing, more of
a thought experiment), but he writes traditional, grammatical, properly
spelled, free verse.

I don't know why he didn't mention Quincy Troupe.  His book "Choruses" would
be a natural spoken word-type text.

Millie (who had always questioned the whole idea of afro-ameriucan studies
and thought it was stupid until, meeting a black person who was interested
in poetry, I decided I wanted to read some poetry by black people.  I knew
very few back poets then, but hopefully went to Barnes & Noble in search of
them and more.  There were essentially no black poets!  And I had thought
that everywhere you looked there was a black poet, a sense I got from
college where we had to study some "politically correct" subject (I had
chosen women, but many people chose afro american literature, and I thought
that everyone was talking about it...so why wasn't it at B&N?)  I also
didn't like some of the black poetry I ran into in college ; it seemed to me
special allowances were being made for people who were minorities (or women,
and I am a woman & I know I got higher praise because I was a woman).  I
thought black poetry was all like Shange, which I don't like (except for the
title of "for colored girls..." which I thhink is brilliant)

But anyway, there I was at B&N and there were NO BLACK POETS.  Nor were
there any decent anthologies of black poets.  (There were some that went
back to Phyllis Wheatley, but I wanted contempoaray poets to read, like the
other poets I read... I just felt I had been neglecting black poets in my
reading.  Now that I saw that the bookstore also didn't have them, I blamed
myself less-- after all, I'd have to buy the books somewhere...  So I went
to an independent bookstore.  Presto!  Black poets in surfeit, on every
shelf, at least one or two.  Most were not to my liking of course, but I
found some who were real finds (the ones I list above oter than Walcott,
whom I have been reading for years).  But it occurred to me that most people
had only B&N and that the poets were not earning much money if the Barnes &
Noble didn't carry their works.  I mean, poets earn next to nothing anyway.
But having their works be unavailable for most people seemed unfair and
probably discriminatory in some way.  So I have changed my mind about afro
american studies departments.  I saw a really subtle, minor (becuase it
affects onlky poets) way in which blackness seriously messes up your career
no matter how good you are.  And I gather from this experience that there
are many other ways in which black people are discriminated against and I
hope these afro american studies students graduate and fight against this
stuff, especially for poets...

Inside the river of poetry
by Louis Reyes Rivera


         Always there is need for song. And every human has a poem to write,
a
compulsion to contemplate out loud, an urge to dig out that ore of confusion
locked up inside. But with the contradictions of privilege and caste, of
class and gender distinctions regulating access, of those ever present
distortions in textbooks with their one-sided measure of human worth, and
with the culture of white man still serving as ultimate yardstick to what is
acceptable as matter, not everyone is permitted to learn to read, much less
to study poetry or hone the art and take the risk of putting one's self on
paper.
         While wanting to be naturally soothed by self-definition, too many
among us learn to rely on commercial lyricists to reflect our joy and pain.
At best, we latch onto committed activists who take on as social vocation
the
work of bridging the human spirit with word made flesh. At worst, we fall
prey to professional wordsmiths (politicians and preachers alike) who
conjure
up another religion that dissuades us from social contention. Somewhere in
between these two extremes, we sometimes meet and break a moment's bread
with
poets.
         Today, what was once called poetry is now Spoken Word Art. Unlike
the
Rappers who have Hip Hopped twenty-syllable couplets into a steadfast beat,
Spoken Word Artists have returned to free verse oration exhilarated by
internal rhyme schemes and unfettered metaphors that speak directly to inner
city blues. The news of the day, testament and affirmation, current and
advanced, informs this form of poetry that outlines the immediate and
understudied aspirations of African and Latino Americans caught in the
crossfire between skin game caste and an ever shrinking planet of high tech
advances.
         Desk top publishing, internet websites, tea parties and Open Mic
readings, marathon jams and poetry slams have combined to form the latest
battlesites between truth and decadence. Inside the range of this contention
are the new poets being pulled by and pushing against a state of confusion
in
search of clarity.
         Their names are many and they come from everywhere, like Jamaican
Dub
Poets in Germany and England, or Nuyorican Poets in Texas and the Bronx. To
single out the more notoriously known here as comprising the new heat (like
Tony Medina, Asha Bandele, Jessica Care Moore, Nzinga Chavis, Saul Williams,
UniVerses, 2nd To Last, Ras Baraka), without qualification, is to commit the
same crime as today's textbooks: taking a single droplet or two out of a
river and making out like two droplets are the actual river itself. For just
as each drop of water helps to form a river, each name dropped is but a
metaphor for the many others who came before or right alongside those whose
work forms our current popular canon.
         Poetry, you see, is as old as breath itself. For when human beings
across the planet simultaneously uttered that first initial sound, they gave
rise to the same echo heard in the wail of every newborn child. The sound of
that cry might be onomatopoeic, but its meaning is quite literal. "I am
here,
now!" This is the essential affidavit that serves as testament inside every
person's compulsion to give voice to the voice, as condition urges vision,
vision provokes thought, and  thought pronounces the name of God: "I matter,
too!"
         Thus the birth of the word, the root of every language. Poetry. The
strength of the people. The finest manifestation of craft, content and
intent
in every written and oral expression. The basis upon which all other
literary
genres have evolved. >From poetry, not only the lyric, but as well drama and
narrative, the expository and the thematic, the didactic and the ideological
as root to all our scripture, sacred and profane.
         It began as a blending of sound (the rhythm), sense (the
experience),
and color (the given image). A voice raised in celebration of itself. Chant
and dance, music and tone, mystery and miracle forged into the embodied
literature of people passing it on, by speech and sight, to each subsequent
generation, asking and answering the fundamental question: How do we live?
And is that the same as how we want to live or what we mean when we say
there's something we're supposed to do?
         The Chinese call it The Way; the Buddhist, Enlightenment; the
Hindu,
Nirvana; the Muslim, Complete Submission to the Will of Allah; the
Egyptian-Judeo-Christian, Seeking the Light; and among many Africans and
Amerindians it was once referred to as Being At One With Life. And from the
poets among them, it is that inner compulsion to Follow the Muse. They speak
to the same cause, challenging the inner voice to maintain balance between
flesh, thought, action. Thus, Poet as author of scripture and Griot as
Keeper
of a Narrative. Each generation, regenerated by its own voices has, since
the
first word heard, added to that tapestry of affirmation. In Egypt and
throughout the Americas, they called it Song; in Israel, Psalms; in West
Africa, Nommo; and in Greece, Poetry.
         It knows no borders. Unrestricted by or to genre, gender, nation,
race, time or class. For in the need to contemplate, inside the compulsion
to
sing, and as Gylan Kain says, "to give voice to the deeper meaning of
ourselves," poets learn to look upon love, life, struggle both as
interchangeable terms and as the only limitations self-imposed. This is why
poets are never invited to participate in televised forums, roundtable
discussions and panels with other writers and speakers, journalists,
politicians, social activists, academics, religious leaders. You never know
what the poet will say.
         This is also why poetry is considered the most dangerous art form,
why it is not honestly taught and thoroughly nurtured into our youth in the
schools, among our adults in the factories and fields, inside our homes,
churches, offices. It cannot be diluted, bought, sold, compromised or traded
without treason to its beauty, its necessity, its meaning. The poet learns
to
care about every word.
          What we often view as a national literature is but one of many
rivers coursing its way into the ocean of all our knowledge. In the general
sense of world literature, we're supposed to bear in mind the ocean into
which every river flows; with the particular local canon, however, we are
actually cheated from studying all those droplets comprising both rivers and
streams (the ethnic and the national), despite the fact that without them,
there'd be no water to feed into that ocean.
         Sad to say that too many of today's Spoken Word Artists lack an
understanding of their own context. So focused on the immediacy of their own
moment of breath, they are not as well studied into the history and
evolution
of this artform for the vocation that it is. In short, they have not really
read or been taught to engage the works of those who came before them. And
so, this contributive note regarding the river of our poetry.
         African American poetry is not restricted to the United States. It
is
an hemispheric phenomenon as old as the dirge and the moan heard inside
those
first slave ships bound for the slave-breaking islands of the Caribbean, to
Hispaniola and Mexico, long before they landed in Virginia. In the U.S.,
where drums were outlawed, it manifested as folklore, Spirituals and the
Blues; in the Caribbean as Plena (Barbados), Bomba (Puerto Rico), Ska
(Jamaica), with conga and steel drums, as with Merengue (Haiti) Mambo (Cuba)
Calypso (Trinidad), like Samba (Brazil).
         With European influences setting up the parameters over form and
acceptability, here or there the poem was separated from music. Thus, slave
narratives grew into novels and African poetry in the Americas often took on
the semblance of European meter, pace and nuance (a la Phyllis Wheatley).
         Today's reading rooms, soirees and poetry jams are hardly a new
tradition, as they can be consistently traced back to 1888, the year that
marked the end of American chattel slavery and the beginning of Negritude
(both in Brazil) --during which period the children and grandchildren of
slaves and runaways begin their careers as writers searching for new
definition (like Charles Chestnut in fiction, Paul Lawrence Dunbar in
poetry,
and W.E.B. DuBois as researcher and social critic).
         Of course, freedmen were writing long before then. North American
(John Russworm, David Walker, Frederick Douglass, Martin Delaney, William
Wells Brown) and Caribbean writers (Placido, Eugenio Maria de Hostos, Ramon
Emeterio Betances, Lola Rodriguez de Tio, Jose Marti) had been laying out a
foundation for a literary African/American thought. But it is after 1888
that
a genuine and continuing renaissance begins, as it now included all of the
descendants of former slaves learning to define themselves on paper. Thus,
Rag and the Blues as immediate metaphor for the thousands of artists in
places like Memphis, New Orleans, Chicago, Santiago de Cuba, Le Cap and
Harlem, who helped initiate a composite rebirth of African art spreading
across the face of America, sometimes rolling like a teardrop, other times
in
denial of itself, but always from the spirit of intellect shaping its own
voice.
         By the 1920s and early '30s, social struggle and a budding
aesthetic
had converged throughout the colonial world. Political movements (unionism,
socialism, communism, anarchism, Pan-Africanism, nationalism, independence)
often intersected with a cultural counterpart (Creolism, Diepalism,
Negritude, the Harlem Renaissance). Cross-fertilizing. Like the largest
number of UNIA chapters during the Garvey years were in Louisiana and Cuba,
corresponding to the growth of a U.S. National Negro Renaissance and a Cuban
Negrismo movement also taking place. Each in their own way stood against
European imperialism while uncovering the parameters of self-definition.
         As with the many African and Latino American poets practicing the
art
today, the list of folks involved back then is endless. In addition to
critics, researchers and activists, like Ida B. Wells, William Monroe
Trotter, Carter G. Woodson, Richard B. Moore, Alain Locke, J.A. Rogers, Zora
Neale Hurston, W.E.B. DuBois, and with people like Arturo Alfonso Schomburg
serving as natural bridge between the English, Spanish, French diasporic
communities, the poets themselves comprised a river of personnel: Pablo
Neruda, Luis Pales Matos, Jose de Diego, Nicolas Guillen, Juan Antonio
Corretjer, Julia de Burgos, Clemente Soto Velez, Alfredo Miranda Archilla,
Aime Cesaire, Leopold Sedor Senghor, Leon Damas, Countee Cullen, James
Weldon
Johnson, Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, Sterling Brown, and so
many others who've not been as extensively published or read as these few.
But their collective impact ushered in new forms and a continuum of literary
stalwarts like Richard Wright, Margaret Walker Alexander, Gwendolyn Brooks,
James Baldwin, and John Oliver Killens. Killens, by the way, along with
historian John Henrik Clarke, co-founded the Harlem Writers Guild, the one
group that definitively bridged the Harlem Renaissance of the '20s/'30s with
the 1960s Black Arts Movement and the 1970s Nuyorican Poetry Phenomenon.
         Those who workshopped alongside Killens, in or out of the Guild,
include at least two generations of dramatists (Lonnie Elder III, Loften
Mitchell, Charles Russell, Douglas Turner Ward, Ossie Davis), fiction
writers
(Alice Childress, Rosa Guy, Piri Thomas, Maya Angelou, Louise Merriwhether,
Sarah E. Wright, Richard Perry, Doris Jean Austin, Brenda Connor-Bey,
Elizabeth Nunez Harrell, Nicholasa Mohr, Brenda Wilkerson, Arthur Flowers),
poets and lyricists (Mari Evans, BJ Ashanti, Askia Muhammad Toure, Mervyn
Taylor, Thulani Davis, Ntozake Shange, Fatisha, and Irving Burgie --the one
who wrote most of the British Caribbean songs that first made Harry
Belafonte
famous).
         With the Black Arts Movement, the proverbial Pushkin spark turned
into flame as the 1966 National Black Writers Conference at Fisk University
(organized by Killens) gave cognizance to what had already been taking
place;
thus we have the new poet-theoreticians, like Amiri Baraka and Larry Neal,
Askia Toure, Ishmael Reed, Audre Lorde, Henry Dumas, alongside new critics,
like Addison Gayle and Hoyt Fuller, new venues, like Umbra, Cannon Reed &
Johnson, or the Watts Writers Workshop, through which Jayne Cortez and
Quincy
Troupe had developed their skills, or like Detroit-based Dudley Randall,
through whose publishing efforts began the careers of Haki Madhubuti,
Carolyn
Rodgers, Sonia Sanchez. Like The Last Poets, many of them were as influenced
by Malcolm X as by Martin Luther King, Langston Hughes, Margaret Walker,
Paul
Robeson and DuBois.
         By the late 1960s, Victor Hernandez Cruz, Jesus Papoleto Melendez
and
Felipe Luciano became the latest spanning between African American and
Puerto
Rican literature that had been previously bridged by the likes of Schomburg,
Guillen and Jesus Colon. As the 1970s took off, a Nuyorican mix began its
own
sidestream fruition to both African American and Puerto Rican orthodoxy.
Spanglish took its place beside AfroAmericanese as a new idiom, with poets
Miguel Algarin, Lorraine Sutton, Americo Casiano, Miguel Pinero, Sandra
Maria
Esteves, Julio Marzan, Lucky Cienfuegos, Roberto Marquez, Jose Angel
Figueroa, Tato Laviera, Noel Rico, Magdalena Gomez, Susana Cabanas and Pedro
Pietri serving as initial progenitors to another poetic sensibility. Its
availability and earned place has often been hindered by Anglo arrogance and
Hispanophilia, caught, as these poets were, between an evolving
aesthetic-in-exile influenced by Ebonics on the mainland and an active
insular and extremely cultural nationalism in Puerto Rico that at first
refused to even recognize this hybrid created out of U.S. colonialism.
         During this same period, from the late 1960s straight into the
1980s,
the tradition of small press and self-publishing (traceable to the 1730s,
when Europe began allowing colonies to own printing presses) had expanded
into roughly 1,000 independent magazines and publishing outlets under the
influence or control of African and Latino Americans: Freedomways, Journal
of
Black Poetry, Hambone, Callaloo, Literati Chicago, The Rican Journal, Third
World Press, Third Press, Quinto del Sol, Black Classics Press, Yardbird
Reader, Mango Publications, Arte Publico Press, Black World/First World,
Poettential Unlimited, Shamal Books, Bola Press, Kitchen Table Press, Single
Action Productions, Blind Beggar Press, Drum Voices Revue, Harlem River
Press, just to name a few.
         Thus, sandwiched between the Black Arts Movement and the rise of
Hip
Hop is a linking generation of African and Latino American poets, producers
and publishers who had come into their own (and many of them by the
mid-1970s) to serve as the latest bridge connecting the continuum of an
hemispheric African American literary canon. These were the students of
Malcolm and Martin and H. Rap Brown, entering the new decade with their own
resolve, reading, performing and organizing everywhere: in prisons,
community
centers, cafes, in homes and on the streets, at Kwanzaa festivals and
Malcolm
X commemoration programs, at political rallies and in the schools. These
sidestream stalwarts, most abundant in places like New York, were the
immediate parents of those who would later become Rap and Spoken Word (Chuck
D., Reg E. Gaines, Bruce George) Artists.
         They had entered the '70s knowing that the major publishing outlets
had already slammed its doors on Black Literature. Thus, they became the
generation that had proliferated the publishing world with their own
gumption, giving rise to, if not solidifying the careers of an Alice Walker,
a Toni Morrison and an Ntozake Shange. Poets-publishers-organizers who did
the basework while working a 9-to-5, raising a family, studying and
performing their craft. In New York City alone, these included Yusef
Waliyaya
from The East's African Street festivals, John Branch from the Afrikan
Poetry
Theatre, Rich Bartee of Poettential Unlmtd., Lois Elaine Griffith of the
Nuyorican Poets Cafe, George Edward Tait of the Afrikan Functional Theatre,
Gary Johnston and C.D. Grant of Blind Beggar Press, Layding Kaliba now with
African Voices, Barbara Smith of Kitchen Table Press, Abu Muhammad of Nubian
Blues magazine, Glen Thompson of Harlem River Press. From them and through
them, such poets as Safiya Henderson-Holmes, Akua Lezli Hope, Zizwe Ngafua,
Dawad Philip, B.J. Ashanti, Ted Wilson and many others previously mentioned
either began or continued finding outlets for their works to appear in
print.
         Meanwhile, music and poetry never did finalize the divorce
Euro-Americans insisted upon. Not only were Hughes and Hurston experimenting
with the "jazz poem" and the intonations of northern and southern folklore
back in the 1930s, but from the BeBop and Afro-Cuban Jazz era straight
through to the present Rap/Spoken Word epoch, musicians and poets have
consistently uncovered the African tradition of incorporating sound and
sense
into a wholistic art form. Literature, music and dance. Louis Armstrong, Sun
Ra, Charlie Mingus, King Pleasure, Slim (Gailliard) & Slam (Stewart), Alvin
Ailey had all eloquently continued that course. Singers Eddie Jefferson, Jon
Hendricks, Oscar Brown, Jr., and, of course, Nina Simone, had long ago fused
poetry into the jazz voice (Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit was actually a
poem someone had given her).
         Of equal significance is the immediate link to Rap and Spoken Word,
musicians Weldon Irvine, Ahmed Abdullah and Oliver Lake, like their literary
counterparts, The Last Poets, Jayne Cortez, Sekou Sundiata, Tom Mitchelson,
Yusef Waliyaya, Cheryl Byron, Atiba Kwabena Wilson, Ngoma Hill, each in
their
turn, have preceded Sharif Simmons, UniVerses, 2nd To Last, etc., in fusing
the poem with the idioms of music and dance.
         And so the insistence that music and word are inseparable elements
to
the voice raising up and rising up comes full circle inside the currents of
modern poetics. It's part of an ongoing continuum in constant evolution, an
unfinished renaissance establishing its own parameters on its own terms.
Like
Sterling Brown once posed, "If it took Europe 300 years to unfold its
renaissance, what makes you think that we can do it in six?"
         And while it is homegrown North American, it is also cross-rooted
in
an African and Caribbean experience.

SHORT STORM


The rain falls down
in buckets
in heaps and piles
in clumps
it disappears
into the ground
for all to see

The gray sky floats
it does not shatter
it does not break
it moves on
lighting up the spring buds
who already glow green
with young electricity



INVENTION


That spider
wove her web
inside the lamp post
glass   near the bulb
all night it 'burns'
and the moths collide
and the flies cry
the same cry ev'ry
night     'it's a trap!'



AJUGA


The minute
       purple forest

suffering of hungry bees
            bumbling for

a taste of life's
         new wine how

old--not this place,
universe
how old--matter I mean or
energy
how old--the future

safe slope
is bosom then

a nipple

of violet ignition



CONFUSION OF A DOG


who attacks
a rabbit nest
        the dug up squeals
a cardboard box
put some grass in the
               cellar it's cold
put some milk
     in the water in this
eyedropper

too much the sight of them
not enough
all they were      four I think
     fur and a beating heart
helpless in their persistence
   to live
       is to hunt and hurt
            eat and believe
the mother
          where she went
fear stronger than the bond
       sometimes

          the mouth
             would open
eyes stay closed or glaze over
a sure sign
             two still alive
                   after a few days
        try to put them near her
that tree
              then under bushes
between leaves they will crawl
          nowhere
to their deaths



THE SCORPION


crawled out from the sea
a long long time ago
and now makes the desert its home
in the sand       it withstands
the sun       in deeply coiled burrows
its nightly fluorescent shine
attracts a meal   it can eat
many times its weight       and not
digest it for years       it stores minerals
in its stinger
             it's more indestructible than
its wielder     its poison can suffocate
most anything       an atomic blast, insecticide
it's futile      the loner can be freeze-dried
and thawed out
walking away like nothing happened



THE LISTENER


Under an azure sky
we will die
our warmth turning to cold

And the owl's eyes
and the owl's hoot
that keeps watch
as you fall to sleep

It goes on, it leaves
and returns, to escape
your eyes and live in

The night
when you go to sleep
and the owl flies awake



TO KISS WITHOUT LIPS


Sound of raccoons
on the roof
            where they feed
or jump around, cavort
       in chimneys
do their raccoon thing

I follow their footsteps
along the gutter, I see
        one who
            sees me

whiter than I expected
the black mascara
             perfectly smeared
the lovely outlaws
        who invade the garbage
for supermarket
            chicken bones
know what's up
                   but don't care
I wonder

          we stare
with nothing to feed each other

The second-story window

               a yellow-bellied sapsucker
I'd never seen one, had to
      look it up         in an encyclopedia
there it was, with its name
(they do not give each other names
       that is a difference, no?
without names they communicate--

stuffed it looked
huddled within itself
its speckled wings a shawl or shroud
             prepared for burial
in a stomach in that sharp
second
        a dazed look       eyes askew
but serene        its frozen face

what age        and what flight
to its family?     perhaps it saw
in the glass    its reflection
thus a mate         or maybe prey
            another indoor worm
squirming in neglect
        of its surroundings

seems to me to read like another attempt at defining some kind of
"authenticity" of experience.

he misspelled leopold sedar senghor's name by the way (though strange to
mention senghor in the context of the "spoken word," given his classicism).

It seems the last line of the last poem, "The Traveler," was rejected. It
should read:

         ...another indoor worm
squirming in neglect
        of its surroundings

the glades are a continuous dynamic process across a planar surface. a
park with variable boundaries, problematic topography based on hydrology
and human intervention. the dynamic is everything; think of the glades as
an _inscribed surface_ transforming in space and time - a surface organic
and shifting. the glades are simultaneous with their entanglement of life
and migration; they are vectored, and vector is everything.

geology is underfoot; to manage the glades is to manage the ecosystem.
invisible topographies / geologies manifest by surface organism. the
indefinite prolonging of comprehension.

Dave. These are good. I like the way you "quietly" work here, and mix
"nature" -  so-called nature - and "man-made" things...of course the
difference is one of poetics or enculturation and so on.  But I like things
like:


"  green
                                                                   with
young electricity"


And your scorpion poem: and many of the others... I'm serious this time!

As to scorpions: I've never seen one but my brother stood on one in
Australia years ago.

Interesting.   Regards, Richard.

Hi list--

I've been working on post-WWII American poetry and thinking about a
lense that might fit, other than the problematic and somewhat tired
divides of Modern/Postmodern, Institutional/Regional, New Critical/Avant
garde, etc.

After WWII, America had this huge economic surge that went hand-in-hand
with advertising, radio, movies, and the developoment of television.  I
wonder if one way to look at post-war American poetry could have to do
with an opening-up-to/closing-off-from American mass/popular media.
Someone like O'Hara comes right to mind-- he had this amazing ability to
just incorporate everything into his work, and not really worry about
the so-called high/low distinctions.  Ashbery sort of did it-- willing
to pay attention to it, but often plays with it in such a way as to
reinterpret it as "culture," not just mass culture.  The academic
American poets of the 50's and 60's often didn't-- but they have
moments.  R. Lowell talks about his "Tudor Ford," and that's his sense
of humor-- popular culture can "be" in his poems, but only at an ironic
distance.  Bishop plays that game, but doesn't resist basing a poem upon
a given issue of National Geographic-- or a misreading of a NY Times
article.

Also thinking about how New Critical tenets were arguably set up to
_resist_ popular/mass culture-- a "good" poem should be self-enclosed,
resistant to social/cultural history-- a little encampment on the edge
of "culture," ready to pull back if necessary.  This ties into the
literary historical angle-- "poetry" shouldn't bother with these things,
but a novelist or playwrite can-- Pynchon is "witty" for doing it so
often, but a poet doesn't seem to be allowed this perspective.

Anyways, a first draft upon nothing maybe, but I'd love to hear from
everyone.  Or suggestions of either poets or critics I should check out.

Thanks,
James

You're right re Ashery: everything becomes material for his art. But what
about looking outside America FIRST, then, you;ll be the first American in
the history of the Universe and might be jailed, but think about the
possibility of a world WITHOUT America. Or explore the novel concept that
there are actually other contries outside the United States: no one would
believe you of course so maybe it would be a doomed project: but gloriously
and courageously doomed. You'll become the one: you'll be remembered as
saving that eccentric little land in North Esat Africa whose inhabitants
think they are the most important nation onthe earth...but sadly.....the
truth! the truth! Richard.(from a country called New Zealand that's N E
W...no, dont worry, just think of New Orleans..... - there's a Country
callled Fran....no forget that, too comlicated....too confusng to a United
Staesian)

I was only jokng: of course you have to stick to the US.....there arent any
other countries.

Hi James,

as for including everything in their writing... consider Ted Berrigan... for
bean spasms...  and everything else.  of course his beautiful sonnets.
several beats fit that distinction...wichita vortex sutra... when was jerome
rothenberg up to what he was up to?  he has a book called between that
published poems from 1960-1963... Jackson Mac Low... John Cage...  evasion
of ego as center of meaning formation for any piece of writing...  bout all
i can come up with as it is late/early here...

Is there a name for a tradition or form of poetry in
which the poet boasts about him or herself?  I know
this of course shows up a lot in rap music, but does
it have any heritage in the poetry of any specific
culture or time?  And can anyone give me an example or
name of a poet who does this well?

Thanks so much--backchannel or front...

Arielle

"Playing the dozens" or "signifying" has a huge history in African
American culture and folk art.  Look to Henry Lewis Gates' book _The
Signifying Monkey_ and the following article for more on that:

Wood, Brent. "Understanding Rap as Rhetorical Folk Poetry." Mosaic
32.4 (1999): 129-146.

Both are good introductions.  I use Wood's article in one of my
poetry classes.  He  draws a strong line of tradition from playing
the dozens through blues to rap.  My students really connect with the
rap element--bringing in lyrics of their own.

Oh, my god, Aaron, these are so beautiful!  I love
Terence Blue's Ali-inspired poem..."I'll break the
flag and I'm God"?!!?  Why can't I write that well?!

This is fabulous stuff.  I'm totally inspired.  Send
more, more!

Yours,
Arielle

my favorite Boasts of all time are in the Iliad--my
favorite translation for the Boasts (they come across
edgier and slightly ironic in the high diction) is
Richmond Lattimore's...

no one talks trash like greeks on the
battlefield...well, unless it's the trojans...

Well, there is long tradition of it in Russian poetry - from Pushkin's "The monument that I created for myself is not by human hands/The crowds will never seize to attend.." (my free instant translation - u can find a better one, i am sure :-), to futurists like Igor Severyanin's and Mayakovsky's boasting of their contribution to Russian letters and bad-ass attitude. There is no name for this tradition, but it's all over the place in Russia Poetry, especially in the early Russian Avant-garde.

Best,

You may not like this Arielle, but Nikki Giovanni's "Ego-Tripping"
was always fun to teach for me.....I especially like the way it ends
with what I take to be a reference to the then current Temptations hit,
"I can't get next to you"-----Well, maybe that needn't be her allusion,
but to end a poem in italics saying I mean I can fly like a bird in the
sky
may itself really complicate the poem in interesting ways
(it's early, not very coherent....)...

Hello Everyone,

The wonderful Krupskaya press in San Francisco is publishing Daniel
Davidson's seven-book long poem, _culture_, and I need to have a (hopefully)
complete list of where portions of it were originally published. If you
published portions of the following of Dan's poems:

"Product"
"Bureaucrat, my love."
"An Account"
"Transit"
"Image"
"Desire"
"Anomie"

Or know someplace that did, please let me know as soon as you can, even if
you think I already have that information.

Many kind thanks in advance,

Gary Sullivan

many cultures have traditions in which, at weddings for example, the
"bride's people" and the "groom's people" (often the female
relatives) taunt the other wedding member with boasting songs of
their respective person (bride or groom)'s sexual prowess.  each
party takes turns one-upping the other.  this seems to have morphed
into various new world things like sports cheers, playing the dozens
(part boast and part insult), raps in which the rapper brags of
his/her rhyming prowess, etc.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

LANGUAGE POETS: AN OVERVIEW


"Language poets" have established themselves as the most rigorous and the
most radically experimental avant-garde on the current literary scene.

Language poets were so sociologically savvy; they knew better than anyone.
Language poets are so significant, that the crux of the matter is a
political one.  I am sure you are.  Language poets had two provocative
insights, which they pushed.

Language poets have questioned notions of expressive voice and stable
identity.

Language poets had lost the instinct for nature and were unwilling to
acquire it through discipline.  Language poets had to destroy it.

Language poets have noted the way in which grammar structures tend to
support the power structures of western societies.  Language poets were a
long way away from the lyrical likes of "The Lake Isle of Innisfree."

Language poets were in a bitter struggle over questions of poetic
inheritance.

Language poets were "taking over."  Books and magazines were being published
by writers.  Language poets had begun writing sequences, some of which were
already being published in Lynx.

Language poets are chosen for this study from the multitude of similarly
oriented.  Language poets are also included, as well as some poetry in
translation. The poems take.

Language poets were the best masters of discovering and using metaphor.
Language poets love metaphors, another case of "language charged with
meaning."

Language poets have claimed in the past to be politically and artistically
progressive, neither.  Language poets are amazingly conservative in the
cosmetic "look and feel" of the poem.  The difficulty....

Language poets had, at least at an earlier point, a real agenda.  They were
able to critique.  Language poets were attacking an Establishment, but it's
hardly the case that today.

Language poets have joined the academy.  Has the latest avant-garde expired?
  Language poets are for the most part intensely interested in literary
theory, and thus see.  Language poets are often criticized for being
over-analytical; Palmer's work can be both.  Language poets are sometimes
addressed in English 210, 284, 285, 265, 261, and 288; and theories of.

Language poets are an extremely diverse though networked group of
practitioners.  Language poets have always practiced.  The only American
formalists of the century may well turn.  Language poets have left the area,
and young writers tend to have conflicting opinions.

Language poets have left open as much as possible their movement through
time (things they write).

Language poets have struck ore in their discovery of untapped creative
depths.  Language poets have refreshed the scene wonderfully, though I
sympathies with those who find some.

Language poets use mnemonics to help you memorize words in the language.
Language poets have been constructing caves, rooms, hermits' cabins,
abandoned houses, temples, the nine rings of hell....  Language poets have
attempted to create false power structures or social functions? much....

Language poets are good--and McHugh is an extraordinary one.  They shuffle
language.  Language poets do this by upsetting the conventions of poetry
through oftentimes.  Language poets do make crazy spew the way it comes out
pouring, naturally or semi-naturally.

Language poets are out to debunk.  The issue is not then, reference per se.
Language poets are just as capable of writing drab prose as anyone else.

Language poets have the aesthetic clothes to wear for perhaps a good
one-third or more.

Language poets have been not only greatly influenced by haiku, but also
often publish haiku.  Language poets write "renku" or linked verse in
patterns.

Language poets do recognize the fact that it is nearly impossible to dismiss
all reference.  Language poets are primary toward whatever meaning a reader
is lucky enough to cull.  Language poets like myself do not necessarily want
to make sense but to make what?  Startling....

Language poets don't fit so easily into a fixed mold.  My aporia.  If poetry
is a kind of talk....

Language poets like Bernstein are positing what we might call the absence of
the pronoun.

Language poets are concerned with the underlying political ramifications of
the American workshop poem.  Language poets have all taken a journey past
the restrictions of Imagism and classical Chinese poetry.  Language poets
wish a plague on both houses for their presumed shared sense of self.

Language poets go on vacation, they leave Stein and Wittgenstein at home and
take Sappho.

Language poets want to be rhetorical, but subtly, denying the subjectivity
of art.  Language poets go on and on about this.

Language poets do not intend to shape "limits" with their poetry but set in
motion "conversations."  Language poets do that, and poetry of that sort is
usually equally obfuscatory and difficult.

Language poets appear more ubiquitous, and more authoritative and powerful,
than they actually are.  Language poets are just a few examples of the
production of our postmodern world.

Language poets are not William Logan's cup of tea.

Language poets do a lot of work that most of the time doesn't interest me.
Language poets do not appear, as yet, to write good poems.  Language poets
are totally trivial and boring, so I won't pursue that one.  I certainly
think.  Language poets have inflated egos and love the sound of their own
voice, e.g. Victor Hugo.

Language poets get closer to New Criticism as Silliman at one point ruefully
admits.  I have.

Language poets have been accused of generating a private discourse, one
which their critics suggest.  Language poets have taken, it does seem to me,
a little burst of anti-intellectualism floating about.

Language poets have encouraged a greater awareness within the field of
poetry.  Language poets are usefully exploring a frontier and may be making
us more conscious of language.  Language poets try to give the most exact
details possible.  Then their readers can imagine.

Language poets use the _Poetry: Reference Sources_ guide to check print
sources.  Language poets use the Index in _Volume 8. Nineteenth Century
Literary Criticism, Twentieth Century_.  Language poets are arranged by name
or anonymous title.

Language poets use Art Deco ceramic capacitor, Smack for Blair at Birth of
Euro, Lophophora seed....  Language poets have traditionally used that plant
to suggest the sadness of parting.

Language poets write about love, painters paint it, birds sing it, we all
feel it.

Language poets are not the gatekeepers of a citadel of higher consciousness.
Language poets are not so much the unacknowledged legislators as the
foreshadowing legislators.

Language poets have completely subtracted a certain
variable--"emotion"--from the poetic.  Language poets are writing only about
language itself.

Language poets are people steeped in language.  Language gives you the
manner of the poem, as well.

Language poets have often reminded us, the question of LANGUAGE stands at
the center.  Language poets are interested in exploring experience through
the written word.  That includes any.  Language poets have continued that
exploration for the last three decades.

Language poets are dealing with these old notions; there's nothing new about
them.  You're given that.  Language poets have answered those questions.

Language poets like Bruce Andrews, Charles Bernstein, Barrett Watten and Lyn
Hejinian.  Language poets like Leslie Scalapino, Clark Coolidge, Ron
Padgett, and Ron Silliman.  Language poets like Bernstein _or_ Andrews.
Language poets like Charles Bernstein _or_ Lyn Hejinian _or_ Bob Perelman.

Language poets like Ezra Pound (1885-1972) and T.S. Eliot (1888-1965).
Language poets like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.  Language poets like Garcia
Lorca, Jorge Luis Borges, and Miguel de Cervantes.  Language poets like
Geoffrey Hill, Henri Cole and Anne Carson.

Language poets do not exist as an anathema.

Language poets have been equally comfortable with our abstract-rooted
vocabulary, or as skillful.  Language poets write about immigration, racism,
poverty, exploitation, etc.  Rhythm, Content and Flavor....

Language poets try to get beyond poetry that is merely "about" a subject,
Ms. Perloff said.  Language poets are much more concerned with arranging
images than with creating them.  Language poets do not invent them out of
thin air.  To construct a new metrical system....

Language poets are fairly obsessed with technology.  Barrett Watten has a
poem.

Language poets are really writing.

Language poets do endure and we want them to thrive.

Much of "Confessional Poetry" -- Berryman, Plath, Sexton, Smith -- has many
strong moments of boasting, as well as well as the "Beats" -- have heard
it...been present for Huncke's, Ginsberg's, Giorno's brags and boasts...

And, although she donned various personas, Kathy Acker, was a heavy-hitter,
boasting and toasting through the night, I'm think here, especially of
"Pussy: King Of The Pirates".

But has been pointed out: it's everywhere -- ancient, present, everywhere.
One of the most shimmering examples (re-discovered, joyfully) is the poetry
of Ho Xuan Hu'o'ng, thinking here of the poems where she attacked male
authority. Wondrous, risqué.

When I search fror concrete "This is what language poetry looks like" "This
is how you describe it in simple terms" "This is how yo write a Language
poem" for me it is a practical question.

I have taught poetry writing courses (over the net to mentally ill folk) and
I take them through various schools of poetry and suggest that they try out
imitating each school's style (if not its thematic concerns; I mean I don't
ask them to write about Fire Island when we do New York School :-).  I have
tried to distill out of each school of poetry a list of "techniques" or else
breaking rules which existed in prior poetry so that students will not end
up choosing a style and writing in it (which is silly-- if I produced a
class of dadaists for exampple I would not be doing my job-- but from Dada
you klearn to uintegrate random elements into ppoetry, to wroite poems
without recognizable words or even morphemes but that often have sound, to
be humorous, to be surreal, and then I lookk at how that's different than
the Surrealists and so on) but rather they will have a toolbox of techniques
that can be used in poems, a kind of higher-level set of techniques above
the level of metaphr and simle etc.

The class is hardly fopr everyone but the poeple who liked it said that
their writing improved and that they learned that they were obeying all
sorts of rules thay thought they couldn't break.  They also said that they
liked being taught something in a wworkshop rather than just doing exercises
(many had been in the lets alll read our poems kind of classs before).

All this preamble is to say, how would I present Language poetry for such an
audience? The absolutely do not understand theory (and neither do I).  But
they write well and can make fine distinctions between various poetic
genres.  As it was, I put together a final set of reading of assorted
contemporary poetry and included some language poems, some poems by James
Tate (what would you call him?  I don't think he's NY school unless he's
second generation NY school perhaps, like Lehman...  But Tate is such an
original ppoet and so unlike the boringness of some NY school hangers-on...)

Millie

P.S.  Won't be teaching until the fall probably.  This summer I'm teaching
web design.  To a similar audience (mentally ill folks who want something to
do while they are on disability other than stuff envelopes or go to day
program where they can color coloring book pages).  I am stressed at the
thought of using my own apartment to teach.  It would take only one creepy
student, or an overeager one who didn't want to leave off on his/her work to
really annnoy me...

I don't want to be so quick to dismiss such "journalistic worrying," because
I think it is also a _practical_ worrying: that is, a worrying centered
around praxis in a given community, or in a set of possible communities
awaiting determination.  One effect of Langpo has certainly been to make
this issue of community's relation to (individual) praxis more crucial than
ever, and to make concerns such as How to Explain a Given Poetics to the
Uninitiated very relevant concerns.  Thus, I don't think even a basic
question like "what is Langpo" can ever be reduced to a "null point," even
if the same reductions and distortions are inevitably rehearsed in the
ongoing head-scratching and mumbled replies.  Of course there is going to be
dumb repetition and wrongheaded misprision, but that's always part of any
extended polylogue.  In fact, I wonder if we don't _need_ the noise and
static as an essential element of the social demonstration performed by
language-centered writing's reception, transmission, and recycling: if its
"tenets" were ever received as transparent, final dicta or definitions, this
would suggest that one should be able to go back and "translate" the work to
reveal where exactly such ultimate interpretations and prescriptions were
encoded.  Barrett, it seems to me that that's similar to what you're saying
in saying "styles and descriptions ... don't just fragment into the same
problem of language or signification."  The way I read much Langpo, it is
far too indebted to the ludic methods of earlier movements like NYS,
surrealism, etc., to be fragmented (collapsed?) in that way.  (And I'm aware
that to make such a connection goes against the implicit or explicit claims
of some of the founding fathers/mothers that Langpo signals a _break_ with
what they see as the anti-intellectual, anti-analytic principles behind
those earlier movements, but I see it nonetheless.)

I'll get back to the "concrete positions"--at least one of them--but first,
I find myself unable to read fully between the lines of your assessment of
this "collective crisis": are you saying it's a pointless crisis to be
having? or are you saying that it's a genuine cause for concern, but that
people are going about addressing it in the wrong ways? or something else
entirely?  I think the difficulty I'm having in gauging _affect_ here is the
most frequent aporia I encounter in reading your criticism generally
(including "Secret History"), which may be part of your intention, and which
in fact is part of what makes your criticism fascinating to me: that
emotional impenetrability.  Or even _positional_ impenetrability.  So my
asking you this question may be very naive, like asking Shandu to explain
where the rabbit comes from (or disappears to).  But you must see that one
big reason that people continue the debate as though you had "never said a
blessed thing" is that the "concreteness" of your position is nowhere near
as obvious as you would have it!  It's been a few months since I looked at
"Secret History" carefully, but _is_ there really an "answer" to the
question in question there?  I remember it as being more about the nature of
collaboration and community politics than about what distinguishes Langpo
per se.  I'm not saying it _should_ be about the latter, but in terms of
your comments on the list, you sound like you're suggesting that the
elements for a substantial grounding are contained therein.  I haven't read
Ben's article, but will find myself a copy.

You do ask a question that I think is valid and important: why don't the
many published accounts out there enter into these discussions more often?
Two possible answers come to mind.  One is that the nature of academic
critical circulation is such that people--especially people not affiliated
with any university that has a good library--often only come into contact
with these materials in dribs and drabs if at all.  The web is changing
this, of course, but there is still some restriction of access to key texts
involved here.  Second, despite what I've just said, these arguments _do_
enter into the discussions, I think (and I assume we're talking about
positions published by people like McGann, Perloff, Hartley, Kim, Spahr,
etc.), albeit mixed and jumbled and filtered through people's all-too-human
and fallible memories of many years' worth of past reading.  If the list
were a refereed journal, the imprecision and abstraction would be more
alarming; but this is an _e-mail list_, and part of the attraction to such a
list, in my opinion, is that people can have something like the kind of
impromptu discussions they have in the hall with colleagues, students, and
teachers.  In such discussions, being off-book as it were, you get to see
how squishy human minds really process this stuff, in the soup, in the act
of daily living (or _fail_ to process it, which may be significant in
itself).  I'd wager that many (tho not all) people who ramble on the list
will produce very cogent and well-documented positions when writing in a
more formal context.  Obviously that's where you want to go for obsessive
consistency, inclusiveness, and retention; here, isn't the idea just to get
a forum going?  Of course, just like at a "real" forum, there's always
someone like you who speaks up and demands intellectual integrity, so....

And once again, I share your frustration at the way what should be exhausted
topics have to be rehearsed again and again and again.  But I suspect that
with every recycling, some nuance emerges that might not have been visible
before, and there are people coming to this topic for the first time who can
never come at from exactly the same perspective as those who were in on the
inception.  Movements get blurry over time, and what might now seem like an
imperfect distortion of an original idea may actually be the necessary
diffusion of past occurrences through a present lens--"necessary" both in
the sense of "inevitable tho regrettable," and in the sense of "needed in
order to make some timely adjustment."  That may sound like an idealistic
apology for weak theorizing, but I don't think it is entirely.

But after all that, yes--how about it?  Is there a comprehensive
bibliography available anywhere?  In Ben's article, perhaps?  On the EPC
site?

To the best of my knowledge, L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry, as
"poetry" doesn't really exist. It's so problematized a term, as to be
nearly impossible to use when actually speaking about a "poet" or
"poetry." As a theoretical term (& as a political one) it's quite useful
and interesting. Quite beautiful, even. Especially with all those equal
signs. I wish people would use them more often.

As a way to assign "good" and "bad" it doesn't work, though. And
wasn't, I think, ever meant to. It's a descriptive term only. The
concept of evaluation doesn't enter, that I've found. Unless it's the
"evaluation" of the/this cultural machinery by the/this/now
dislocated opacity of the art act itself. Which couldn't possibly answer
your question, of course. And would seem to be, perhaps, historically
bound anyway?

All of this is just "maybe."

There are some great boasting poems in the old Irish poem Sweeney Astray, as
translated/rewritten by Seamus Heaney.  It's one of the cleanest, least
gloppy things Heaney ever did, too.

Here's a complex but short 1973 text that appeared in the French poetics
journal _Change_ (1967-82) and that I recently translated.

_Change_ was founded by certain _Tel Quel_ writers who came to hold serious
political-theoretical differences with the latter's editors.

This text, below, by novelist Jean-Claude Montel, points to certain
international resonances for 1970s Language Poetry.

For example, at the end of his essay, you will see that Montel coins and
proposes a "dys-writing" that creates communicational dissonances in the
global circulatory system of capital. The idea of a "dys-writing" addressing
issues of circulation (of capital, of language) presciently identifies, I'd
say, the poetics of Bruce Andrews (among others).

I write a bit about this Montel text in relation to Mayakovsky^Òs and Brik's
great concept of the "social command" in an Afterword (not included here).
Both will soon appear in the little newsletter, _endnote_ #5 (1339, 19th Ave
NW, Calgary, Alberta, T2M 1A5, Canada), which I'd be happy to send anyone
for $2. (Thanks to the eds. for letting me send this ahead -- as a sort of
advertising banner, perhaps.)

Might be of interest to recent debate...

"A Propos the Social Command" [_Change_ 4, 1973]
by Jean-Claude Montel

(translation from the French, Louis Cabri)

        Since we have decided to stick with Mayakovsky in these notes on the
"social command," let us begin with his definition in _How Are Verses Made_?
Thus, the social command is constituted by "the presence of a problem in
society, whose solution is imaginable only in poetic terms." One must not
confuse this -- as it seems that we have tried hard to do for almost half a
century -- with the "practical command" (i.e., "actual commissions")
constituted by the existence, in society, of _solutions_ that the poetic
work has as its function to _illustrate_. These two conceptions are
irreducible to each other, and do not coincide. Passage from the one
conception to the other (a passage we can schematize in identical language
as above: ...the existence of solutions that the poetic work could prolong
(could complete), indeed, plan...) is excluded, for the simple reason that
the practical command (of an actual commission), produced by society and
reproduced by "the work," denies the specificity of poetic practice,
depriving it in advance of all possibility of real intervention in the order
of discourses. These discourses are established for the sole advantage of
Power, serving it with the goal of reinforcing it, by generalizing it.

        On the contrary, the social command aims to bring the intervention of the
written text to its point of optimum efficacity. With what means, and in
what registers?

        For Mayakovsky, two ideas have priority above all others and constantly
guide him in his poetic work:
        1. "A 'poet' must be in the middle of things and events,"
        2. "The poetic work must go beyond the event by introducing distance of
time and place, and if distance does not exist in the facts, to at least
take mental distance."

        This, simply, defines a double relation of belonging. On the one hand, a
"poet" finds himself in the middle of society, taking part in the ordinary
and everyday. On the other hand, he must also have "an exact knowledge, or
rather sense, of the desires of his class (or the social or political group
that he represents)" so that, in poetic work, he can go beyond this
knowledge and write the theory of his practice.

        Such an attitude, in its historical and social practice -- by which a
"poet" heats "the boots of the revolution" -- supposes in return that it can
test the text a poet writes because of it, respond to hypotheses the text
contains, and adequately portray the necessary utopia that will traverse the
text. We know the Soviet power born in 1917 could or would not respond to
the questions posed by -- and that it itself posed to -- the Futurists and
Formalists. We know that this Soviet power contributed to thickening even
more, and to reinforcing, the meaning of author, work, realism, character,
etc. (seriously menaced as these words already were, in the capitalist
Europe of this era). The historical checkmate of Futurism and of Formalism
in no way signifies that the questions they posed lacked sense; rather, they
could not find their real point of application in this new sovietized
Russia. The fact that -- after some fifty years of underground life -- these
ideas are re-emerging with force in our modern capitalist society, confers
an even greater value on them.

        What does Mayakovsky mean when he insists: "a 'poet' must be in the middle
of things and events"? In the first place, that the "poet" inhabit a society
that is -- because socialist -- his own; also, that in no way should he
regard this as a form of submission. He must, in his manner, precede and
constantly go beyond Society -- "be in the vanguard of his class" -- so that
Society is rendered visible (and readable) by the signs and events that
constitute it (and that it constitutes, in return). For what concerns poetry
in particular, Mayakovsky proposes more than a model of reading: _the sole
thinking_, in fact, constantly worth reading on language and the poetic work
in society. He gives form to _response_, for all, in the form of silent and
potential signs.

        It is in this sense that one must understand, it seems to me, the other
instruction of Mayakovsky's, which insists (and not solely for the reader)
on the necessity of undertaking the study of the written text "from the side
of a just examination of the process of _manufacture_." It means, in effect,
something completely different than a tip of the hat to his Formalist
friends, or than designating a "work," call it poetry, that one perceives
from a distance... In question here, and without doubt for the first time,
is a fundamental rupture introduced in the relations between "work" and
"author." The point again, it is true, is to abandon these terms, or to
replace them -- the condition, implicitly posed here, is of this necessity.
A new perspective on the "poetic work" can be elaborated from this already,
in its proper place and time, beginning with material furnished by history,
and linking to the problematic of history itself. More importantly, this
elaboration will occur on the model of _industry_ (the word is
Mayakovsky's), bringing into play -- at the service of the text -- the
ensemble of manual and intellectual operations necessary to the text's
production, in order to constitute the completed social command (just as we
can speak of a fulfilled contract).

        * * * *

        The operative force of this idea is that the social command is initially
inseparable from both the "middle" position of the poet (and in relation to
the primary state of poetry) and, in another sense, the state of society
which corresponds to that text containing the totality of all forms it will
be led to take in the course of its elaboration (before achieving its
"principle of reality," once the work is completed). From there we see that
the social command is a formal and aesthetic category, not given in advance
but discovered and patiently constructed in the course of a series of
transformations conducted through writing itself. In other respects, the
work of the text is but a moment and a particular state of the social
command. We understand, now, that the social command is present at the two
extremities of the writer-reader chain, that it can -- all at once --
instigate the poetic work, determine it, regulate its elaboration, and
assume its existence once achieved. The imperative of the social command is
at once present and absent, found in that gap, optimally at the proposed
time and place (in the "middle") where the text, once set (after many
gropings and fruitless attempts) can ceaselessly start again to take meaning
beyond the habitual paths or circuits assigned to its circulation,
conforming all the while to the movement of its production and in view of
creating _real metabolisms_ capable of putting in relation, by the
intermediary of the poetic text, society with itself. The text of the social
command establishes a process of permanent rereading.

        It seems clear now that Mayakovsky's example suggests that the task is to
develop the text (or fiction) from particularly sensitive nodal points
within the social. It also suggests that we should consider "society" as a
single, we could say _global_, text. To perceive today, in these conditions,
the social command, is precisely to find oneself -- to place oneself -- at
these sites and hinge-moments of discourse, and, moreover, to be conscious
of being -- of doing -- so. To bring these moments into existence is
tactically and strategically premeditated to use these discourses (as much
visual, aural or written) with the sole aim of _ruining_ them, one by the
other, to make them _lie_ constantly, to _contradict_ them. It is -- once
their separation (in which these discourses are artificially maintained) is
broken -- to put them back into connection in view of constructing a single
and unique (but plural) text independent of those who served in its
elaboration, and strongly attached to economic, political, juridical,
sexual, etc., plans.

        In a certain way, the Joyceian problematic of the single word prioritized
for its etymology must be substituted for the complete phrase, with its
variable construction overlapping in function the order of priorities it
engenders and to which it returns.

        In effect, it is the research (and the putting into practice) of a
_dys-writing_, susceptible to pressing with all its weight on language (the
instrument, up to today, best adapted to circulation and therefore to
production), to scour language to make apparent its skeleton. This skeleton
is what Marx calls the central (the middle) discourse and that he defines as
follows: _Circulation is the movement that makes general alienation appear
as general appropriation, and vice versa.
This constitutes our own social command_.

        What remains is to entirely exit this problem, and to denounce, in this
relation -- social command, practical command -- the functioning of ideology
as fashion system.

Dear Mark,
          Thanks for the few thoughts. My thought on them just now is that
what you describe--and others--is an unremarkable process not specific to
'L= poetry' by which some texts or discourses said/thought to be new are
assimilated, i.e. communicated, or disseminated, i.e. enter into
circulation. You speak of 'academic and cultural reception'.


 The process always seems to me marked, may even be characterized,by
 underreading and misreadings, i.e. by miscommunication,
 misunderstanding.  Miscommunication is motivated, designed to reduce
 difference to  sameness--Millie Niss's post was asking us to help her
 do just that. But to help her would would not be any help.
 Yet,  there is no escape, it is a question of managing the process;
 teaching is a matter of that--how much difficulty, how much difference
 can a student be exposed to, before a helping hand is offered?
               Wystan

Subject: a few thoughts


I'll try to pull together a response to various threads in this ongoing
discussion.  I'm doing this mostly from memory after having read & deleted
many posts, so apologies if you feel I've misrepresented or misattributed
something you said.

I believe Laura Fargas asked whether anyone could articulate an aesthetic
for judging which L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poems are better than others.  I don't
believe anyone can, in part because I read the moves to politicize poetry's
formal apparatus & historicize its reception into a larger network of social
relations, as a rejection of aesthetic criteria as such.  (Or, the rejection
of aesthetic criteria as ~primarily~ important).  If you bracket off this
rejection & attempt to re-aestheticize that body of work, then Language
Poetry doesn't make much sense, or that is, retain the same relevance.

Yet the situation is a little more complicated than that.  In her post, the
absense of a criterion is linked to the old saw "I know what I like."  If
"knowing" what you like suggests an uncritical response, I'd say that it's
nearly impossible to have a coherent critical response to something as
omnipresent & generic-- in the sense of its academic & cultural reception--
as "Language Poetry" has become.  (Surely this was the impetus behind Kasey
Mohammed's playful post, or at least as I would read it).  On the other hand
if she had asked, can anyone articulate why _My Life_ (for example) remains
a worthwhile text, I'd bet she would have gotten dozens of thoughtful
replies.  Yet to turn the question on its head-- I'd like to know which of
us ~doesn't~ "know what she likes."  And which comes first-- the "liking" or
the critical response?  Who other than some poor graduate student would
invest more than a pale degree of energy & attention upon some work they
didn't care about?

Joe Amato says that L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry must still be very relevant, & as
evidence he points to all the recent posts on the subject.  Well I agree,
Joe, it's still relevant, but I'd also ask, is it the ~work~ that's relevant
to the one posting, or the idea of the work, or its reception in one form or
another.  I think that Bill Austin has the last word here, when he writes,
"Critics find the [LP] movement innovative.  The originators are celebrated,
ergo their writing ascends, not because of its aesthetic merits, but because
it is valued as first."  And who can argue with him, except perhaps to note
some of the poets, like MacLow, Coolidge, Cage, Spicer, Stein & Zukofsky,
who came before the firsts.  (And yes, I'm aware that it's not the same
thing as *valued* as first: a clever distinction, Bill).

I'm not trying to be skeptical here-- or if I am, it is not toward the
writers & writing grouped under the banner of "L=A=N=G=U=A=N=G=E Poetry,"
but rather toward what I'm calling here its academic & cultural reception.
Ultimately, Bill's analysis is irrefutable, while it also suggests that
what's most "relevant" to us may be the poetics of the Kings of the Hill.
One of the problems attendant with the Kings-of-the-Hill line of thought is
that it reinscribes the imperatives of economic & cultural forces we would
otherwise critique, but in this case shifts the marginally favored position
to some ironic heirs apparent.  Winner take all: well fortunately that's
~not~ it.  In the end, I like and most agree with mIEKAL's post-- just in
the sense of attending to the small l's, to READING outside the conditions
of institutional acceptance.  Poetry-- David Hess is right-- is larger than
these games; I wonder if any of us is able to articulate how & in what
sense.

Cheers,

Mark DuCharme

The Lady Bug Execution

Tell us they bite, it's O.K. to kill them,
It's all part of the grand plan, the Ladybug Execution.

Let me introduce you, to my foreign friend,
He's happy to be here, he's from a strange land.

We've never seen, the likes of him before,
Exotic and pretty, and so we want more.

Oddly it seems, on our soil he thrives,
He's started a family, his ranks multiplied.

We feel so guilty, inviting him in,
He's just so damn pretty, to kill him's a sin.

And yet still he prospers, while we fight to survive,
And so now he's evil, and we're justified.  And we're justified.  And
we're justified.

Tell us they bite, so it's O.K. to kill them,
It's all part of the grand plan, the ladybug execution.

Well, the flurry of responses to this question indicates clearly that
boasting poems are well attested in many places.  It is certainly a prominent
genre in Indo-European poetry: beside the Russian and Greek traditions
already mentioned, Old Norse and Celtic poetries are rich in boasting poems.
The name of the Old Norse god of poetry, Bragi, used to be etymologized as
"bragger."  I think that this is a folk etymology, but in my view it is a
telling one.  Bly, Hillman, and Meade, in their admittedly very new-ageish
anthology *Rag and Bone Shop of the Heart*, referred to this genre as "the 'I
am" tradition."

If I might be permitted to brag, I have offered an alternative name for this
genre, which I think is widespread throughout world folklore and poetic
traditions [including, for example, Jesus'  "I am Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the ending, that which is, and that which was, and that which
is to come, the Almighty...."  Well, I know of African, Hawaiian, Native
American samples as well as the Indo-European ones.  But my main interest has
been the extensive evidence of the genre in India, from the Vedas to the
Bhagavad Gita.  Walter Ong, the Jesuit who productively explored the
technologies and psychologies of oral poetries, argued that oral poetries
tended to be agonistic in style, which means that boasting in such cultures
was a matter of establishing the validity, the authority, of one's voice.
Africans who found themselves trapped within the vicious network of the
western slave trade had to establish their voice by humbly "boasting" of
their sincerity, and of their moral integrity, before anyone would listen to
them.

In an article published in a journal called *History of Religions* [Number
37.2, 1997] entitled "Ahamkara and atmastuti: Self-Assertion and
Impersonation in the Rgveda", I gave the genre a Sanskrit name: ahamkara.  It
means something like "ego-performance"  or "ego-ritual."  That, it seems to
me, is what boasting is.  To boast is to assert one's right to speak.  It is
all about establishing the ego as a speaker.

In this article I refer to and quote the Nikki Giovanni poem already
mentioned, a Diane Di Prima poem of the same genre, and to a Sharon Olds poem
called "The Language of the Brag."

To my knowledge, no one of any wsdom whatsoever has adopted my proposal that
this well-established genre of world literature be labelled with this
Sanskrit name. Vedicists nevertheless have recognized its value with regard
to the Vedic material.

Well, what name would the members of this list prefer to my stupidly obscure
Sanskrit name?

George Thompson,

If ahamkara "means something like 'ego-performance' or 'ego-ritual'," then I
think the latter encompass too much, and too broadly, to describe
exclusively and specifically the brag. "Ego" even is complex to translate
into the English sandwidg, let alone Ingwidge poetry. Stirner's egoist, _The
Egoist_, Mac Low's "ego" that is bumped from predetermined text-generating
procedures, Olson's "lyrical interference of the ego" (which should have
actually been written as "egoistical interference of the lyric"), these are
all different, as are you in your modesty.

One of the things that has filled me inbox over time on this list are the
glimmers of academic, cultural, and poetry jockeying I am at times able to
witness - as in the recent LP flurry.  Not as bad as usingor misusing
banishment as a badge of glory, certainly.  While i can wish for a return to
announcements and engaged discussion of actual poetry and poetics, such is
human nature in all its glory, I guess.

 so let me clarify.


Teaching.  Student picks up a poem and sets about reading it in terms of
poems she/he is familiar with. This does not work; either it is evident
during the process, or the assignment comes back with a bad grade. The poem
is too different. You said yourself in a previous post that where LP failed
is in content. Now that's quite amazing to me.
First, as you know, 'content' has moved house, it's not where it was before
but that does not mean its left town. When the reading 'doesn't work' it
will often be because it seems the meaning has left town. (I'd like to see
more discussion about the kinds of content LP has returned to poetry). What
I am saying is that I will try to help the student out of that bind, with
another poem that is somewhere between 'the model' she is working with and
the one that has stumped her. For example, a poem by Bernadette Mayer, of
some Ron Silliman.  Or, I will offer some generalisations about the new
'model', a different set of 'rules' or conventions that are at work in the
practice,  and in this way I'm doing something like Millie Niss was asking
for: a category, a definition. As a way past that difficulty. In these
terms, then, difference and difficulty are linked--of course, they aren't
always or necessarily. What we have here are two linked kinds of
'under-reading',the student's and my own.
             Wystan

Hey, Thomas, I thought Kasey's extended piece was much more than 'jockeying'
--same goes for Barrett's question and Kasey's response.
This satisfies my expectations of engaged disucssion of poetry and poetics,
whets my appetite.
             Wystan

One of the things that has filled me inbox over time on this list are the
glimmers of academic, cultural, and poetry jockeying I am at times able to
witness - as in the recent LP flurry.  Not as bad as usingor misusing
banishment as a badge of glory, certainly.  While i can wish for a return to
announcements and engaged discussion of actual poetry and poetics, such is
human nature in all its glory, I guess.

       you shall love     kiss for the first
no--last time    start a riot
    by holding hands
    prisons are sexy   is that what they're saying?
           the romance of crime!
               oh I wish I could remember
I wish I had a past
   that was dangerous    still   could get me
     caught         send in the dogs!
put my face on TV    parade me before
the populace     with my head bowed
I'll yell to blind dates
      with the chance of fate    'Wake up!
sleepy prisoneers,
       everything around here's
          a dinner and a movie!'

Have you seen the commercial
with the Playboy playmate
lounging poolside with her
little bottle of Longitude?

(as opposed to Latitude
which would be for width
or is it girth?)

What could possibly
make the penis grow bigger,
pack on the pounds
is it a common weed?
something in your backyard
the Heavenly Father put on
this Earth for all to share?

Or is it a man-made chemical
cooked up by the synthetic
God of Dick in some frothing
beaker, a heat-resistant
test tube veined with
sterilized pipes?

I think it's harvested
from an exotic plant
where the big dick people live
a phallus-shaped stalk
that stands up when touched
and lies down when alone
shooting out sticky pollen
when you bend down to sniff it

Hi Louis,

this take on 'circulation' has put a brick in the road of my morning. I just

Now Wystan and List. What I think (I'm probably a bit off beam but it doesnt
matter, it gives me a "start point") that what Wystan is saying here is that
when we read certain kinds of poetry - let say we are reading Jacob (for me
that means the translation availalble at the Auck Uni and I've probably
copied it ) of his - is it the Pearl and the Oyster, and were are young and
we've read Keats and so on and maybe even Eliot and some of say Ted Hughes
and so on:whammo! what the hell's this all about.....the answer is the same
as reading language poetry...now eg a great book or work for me is
Silliman's "Paradise" or "Tchanting" and there's "My Life" and Barrett
Watten's work and so on: now...it becomes a case of on one level
"acclimatising" to this kind of thing (now many years ago a friend of my
father gave me a book of e e cummings....I'd never heard of him, but it was
a kind of shock: the most radical poets I knew then were Eliot and Thomas
(Dylan) .. but not long after that I "checked  out " of poetry for some
time...but nowadays cummings...radical as he may have been...now seems quite
tame: now that aspect,tthe shock of the new, the ostranie, is important: but
on "first looking into Silliman's 'In the American Tree' " many years after,
there was a similar shock: now at this point people either reject the
strangeness totally or embrace it...of course some are indifferent or go
elsewhere....but the other point is that poetry, language  invention,
however you style it, must continually change and offer up new ways into (in
a way the same "content"..but its more subtle than that) ... we need to see
that various language practices -whether we we call it Language Poetry
poetry or not are always, if they are to pierce to that central significance
of things and what we are (and this is where language is important because
we are - not made by perhaps - but inextricably connected to the language
process) or experience: which in fact is what we I feel "should be" as
poets: but what happens is that we are always, as literature advances - or
"moves" or "lives' - so to speak: and art, music and literature are
significant in a way science (immensely valuable as it is or can be) can
never be: all Scientists can do about 'reality' is to accumulate dull dry
facts: a la Gradgrind, and sub speciae aeternitatis, this is hopeless.  Now,
I'll leave aside the importance of the polyvocal, , mutlt-layed,
multi-levellic, polyvocal, processional, and other approaches that language
poetry has extended  for now.  But lets look at Coolidge (and someone
compared making language poetry to the way jazz was improvised - now bear in
mind that all music was originally,  including the so-called "classical
music"  ... Liszt could improvise whole concertos (or sonatas so
extarordinary they were like symphonies) .. now Coolidge has/had a jazz
background....in  his Polaroid one sees this improvisatory, in my opinion
true musical or "instinctual" process like a river of words and ideas
(although the ideas are not logically proccessional or logically progressive
as such): this is a kind of writing unlike the more deliberative works of
other language poets: so one person may hate Coolidge going on and on, but
he freedom is gained, and if we turn to Heijinian ... we are really in the
same realm as any great poem, or any beautiful enigma, we can only find
"ways of reading these texts" but without the capacity for "negative
capabitily" all knowledehge of modern philosophy, the political
signification of literature,and theory, is of no avail.
   Useless? No. Quie the opposite:  the language poets are in fact
continuing and greatly developing the critical/processional aspect of
literature which has been with us for ever: eg I dont  know much of
Aristotle, and I'm pretty shaky on Coleridge: but  the Romantics without
Coleridge's great theoretical work is  dead language, and Aristotle is a
part of poetry and drama: that it and other writings and commentaries (which
critiques arguments commentaries are always there - implied or expressly
expressed)...
and what is often overlooked is that a theoretical proces always acompanies
the practice of lit: its seen eg in Williams "Spring and All" with the Prose
and poetry sections, and even in Lowell. and of "Life Studies" in the
magnificent ramblings of Olson, O'Hara is a theoretician with his heart
(Reverdy) in his pocket, and part of his theory leads him into his influence
on Ashbery toward including "popular culture"...someone who is agressively
"traditional" like a New Formalist, is still reacting to theoretical
positions: and the language poets focus in on the preposition, the syntax,
and so on, the way by "atomising" them "new" meanings (or ways of seeing
into the old or ways of refreshing the dead into life with the blood of
slain life as in The Odyssey: the theoretical is liberating - but we learn
ways to 'read' language poetry, but  soon its not enough to use only the
armory of such things as 'parataxis', or metonymy, or the concept of
process: we have to revisit these ideas with new "takes"...it is de rigueur
soon that all we can gain are "ways in" or "approaches", and as we enter the
(truly new, truly innovative thing (text or whatever))Z: it leaps sneeringly
away with new devices and misleadings like The Joker, and like all "great"
literature (we cant even define that: I can only assert its possible
existence - hence our irritation at too much canon-making, even if we a
rather like old Harold Bloom....admire his love of words...) we are
confronted and mostly baffled by the eternally recreated mystery of words
and winds and nusic that screams always out there, stinulating, provoking:
always beyond us.   Richard Taylor.

Poems Inspired by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's "I Have a Dream" being read=

on Stone Mountain for the United Nations by Atlanta School Children.

Students from Atlanta's public schools will climb Stone Mountain on April=

27, 2002 to read poems inspired by Dr. Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dre=
am"
speech followed by a larger reading at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Chur=
ch
where Dr. King preached.  The reading at the Ebenezer Baptist Church will=

also feature prominent poets Cheryl-Floyd Miller, Teri Elam-Blanchard and=

environmentalist Hugh Morton. The event called Poetry on the Peaks was or=
ganized
after the United Nations General Assembly declared 2002 as the "Internati=
onal
Year of Mountains (IYM)" to increase international awareness of the globa=
l
importance of mountain ecosystems. To further this aim, Dialogue Through
Poetry have setup poetry readings on twenty-four mountaintops around the
world including the Seven Summits (the highest peaks on the seven contine=
nts).


The event is co-organized by the Martin Luther King National Historic Sit=
e,
Megan Sexton with Five Point magazines at Georgia State University, and
Dialogue Through Poetry.  The reading on Stone Mountain will take place
on April 27 at 12 PM and the free reading at the Ebenezer Baptist Church
will occur at 3 PM.

Other participants include editors from Suien magazine in Japan who will
climb Mt. Fuji and read a poem by Native American poet Joy Harjo. Profess=
ional
mountain climbers working with Alpine Ascents International and Internati=
onal
Mountain Guides will read poems by Pablo Neruda, Walt Whitman, Gary Snyde=
r,
Rumi, Wislawa Szymborska, William Blake, Han Shan and many others on moun=
tains
throughout 2002. Lastly, to honor Pablo Neruda and celebrate IYM, a petit=
ion
has been submitted to International Astronomical Union (IAU) to name a cr=
ater
on Mercury after the beloved Chilean poet.

"As we begin commemorating the International Year of Mountains, conflict
may be the single greatest obstacle to achieving our goals. Without peace=
,
we cannot reduce poverty. Without peace, we cannot ensure secure food sup=
plies.
Without peace, we cannot even consider sustainable development," commente=
d
Jacques Diouf, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations (FAO) at the 2001 global launch of International Ye=
ar
of Mountains at the UN headquarters in New York City on 11 December 2001.=

this sounds self-evident, but it's amazing that not more has been
written about it. i've puzzled a lot over the lack of Birmingham
school-type of interest in "poetry" (compared to the Frankfurt
School's interest) but have come to the tentative conclusion that
poetry is too rarified a genre for cultural studies (with certain
exceptions) because "genre" is not really supposed to be at issue
anyway.  check out andrew ross's No Respect, it's on intellectuals
and popular culture in the 1950s.  also marjorie levinson on
elizabeth bishop (though it looks as if you have already looked into
this). i've got a chapter in Dark end of the Street about poetry
written by teenage girls at a GED project that draws heavily on
certain kinds of newspaper reportage. paul beatty draws heavily on tv
and mass culture in his books of poetry, Big Bank Take Little Bank
and Joker Joker Deuce.  Amiri Baraka often uses popular cultural
forms or images in resistance to mass culture --an interesting move.
harryette mullen uses popular culture in terms of fashion in
Trimmings, and in terms of vernacular language in  Muse and Drudge.
John Giorno uses popular song lyrics in his staggered poems.  Howl
uses images of popular/mass culture all over the place ("hydrogen
jukebox" being a key instance).  Jack Spicer used baseball.  Joseph
Harrington has a new book out from Wesleyan UP on US poetry and the public
sphere but most of it deals w/ the first few decades of the century.
nonetheless, you might find some good methodological nuggets or general
musings that would be of interest.  bests, m d

I was sitting in a bar in Seattle a couple of weeks ago, and the
bartender played for me a spoken word CD.  He played a poem by an Asian
American artist.  On the bar napkin, I wrote "Broken Word," which was
the title of the CD, which I think was a collection of different Asian
American spoken word speakers.  In any case, the napkin is all I have,
and I am now far away from Seattle, so I can't go back and find the
bartender, get the title, and try the rest of the northwest
micro-beers.  I have searched all around the internet, and have not been
able to find the CD.  Does anyone know about this CD, and could you
backchannel the full title, label, etc., so I can find a copy?

Thanks.

For anyone with some French & a strong intest in the work of Gilles Deleuze:
radio France Culture is broadcasting a large series of programs on/about/of
Gilles Deleuze between 22 april & 5 may. Most of them can be listened to at
any time as they are archived, a few are available only at the moment of
broadcas
 Most interesting is a series of lectures by Deleuze on the Nomadology,on
Leibnitz, on the Fold, etc. ZThere are also several felix Guattari archival
programs worth listening to / recording. Easiest access:

Should be, at end of Montel translation, where Chris encountered the brick:

        [Marx quote:] ...._Circulation is the movement that makes general
alienation
appear as general appropriation, and vice versa_.

        This constitutes our own social command.


That is, Montel says the latter (in 1973). Marx invented the concept of the
"social." Mayakovsky and Brik, after the Revolution, invented the concept of
the "social command."

BARBARA HENNING & EDITH JENKINS

Barbara Henning has two new books out from Spuyten Duyvil: the poetry
collection Detective Sentences and the novel Black Lace, which Lewis Warsh
says ^Óhas the power of a Depression-era Walker Evans photo.^Ô  During the
early nineties, Henning edited Long News in the Short Century, a journal
of art and writing. She grew up in a working class suburb of Detroit;
currently she lives in the East Village.

Edith Jenkins is, as Tillie Olsen hails, ^Óa poet distinguished by luminous
intellect, wit; passionately controlled depth and range of experience^Ô and
as Carl Rakoski echoes ^Óa serious author with depth, of obvious stature.^Ô
Her work encompasses the personal, the political, and the philosophic and
includes the crisp, marvelous memoir Against a Field Sinister (City
Lights, 1991).  Her latest book, Selected Poems (Black Star Series, 2001),
draws from over five decades of an activist life.

I've been looking again into Wilfred Bion and beckett and Bionic links on
the internet linking and collaboration (In addition to the Kleinian and
psychoanalytic connections to Bion he was influential in the work of the
Group collaborative work centered around the U of Chicago in the 60s and 70s
and still alive - Qsorts, for example)

Discussions of some topics here would seem to take on the dream like
character of his -K links: we love to hate you or we hatefully love you or
lovngly hate?

this may be somewhat oblique to 'inchoate' but I have reason to ask where
one would wander today to find an active school of poetry, assuming the NY
school, SF scene, LP, etc., are dying?

Fish, children and disobedient dogs need schools. I'm not sure poets do.

Well, I adopted the Sanskrit term ahamkara to refer to an indigenous poetic
genre [the term in fact is traditionallly used as a philosophical notion;
applying it to a poetic genre is something that I have invented, for better
or worse].  Is it too broad to describe the brag?  Maybe.  But my article is
a bit more detailed than my Poetics List post was.  As for the complexity of
ego, whether Stirner's or Mac Low's or Olson's, or even mine own -- to be
sure, egos are complex.  Far be it from me to de-complex the poetic egos of
such people.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

-


(the work so far)


    phenomenology of approach


    = categories for projected text =
    = approaching the everglades, the city, illness, language, culture =

     1  domain limited or unlimited
a limited domain is inscribed with or without fuzzy boundaries. domains
may be limited in sememe, space, and/or time. example: everglades bounded
by hydrology, ecosystem.
     2  clues and cues from immemorial past
a clue is an interpretable symptom, according to a scheme based on an
articulated methodology. a cue is the activation of a scheme based on an
anomaly or repetitive structure within the domain. the domain in turn may
be defined by clues and cues.
     3  difference between clues and cues
a clue is based on evidence from the past to the present; a cue is based
on activation within the present.
     4  relevance theory and approach
clues and cues are such by virtue of relevance; theoretical methodology is
part of a critical sifting apparatus.
     5  top-down classification schema
this follows for example category theory, chaos/fractal theories; one
always already begins with pre-theoretic presuppositions.
     6  wonder, innovation, contradictions
beginning with a sense of awe - everything signs everything, everything
inscribes. innovation in terms of heuristic projections and introjections
- contradictions in terms of anomalies, revisions, recuperations, returns.
     7  deep ecologies, interstitial
the ecologies become perceptually deeper; gaps are filled in; one lives in
depth in the glades, aware of cyclical time, anomalous events, local
histories, individual plants and animals.
     8  filling in the habitus
from larger to smaller clues and cues - alligators and wading birds to
landbirds and invertebrates for example. as one moves down in scale,
identification becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible.
     9  from anomaly to behaviors
and back again; behavior clusters based on attributes. or from story to
structure, diachrony to synchrony, anecdote to prediction.
    10  sense of occupation and intimacy
inhabitation based on familiarity, familiality.
    11  familiarity, familiality
in the first, equivalence scripts and schemata, universals, typifications;
in the second, identity scripts and experientials, individuations.
    12  maternality
chora and matrix - the inchoate beneath the surface of the subject.
    13  deconstruction of the abject
disarticulation of the abject as such and rearticulation in terms of
microstructure, skein. the muck and clutter in relation to marl/peat moss
and biome or flora/fauna regimes. muck and clutter as regimes.
    14  phenomenology of naming
following the notion of rigid designators, beginning with classification,
classification experience, virtual subjectivity and its relation to
concrete manifestation.
    15  inarticulate inchoate
maternality: see above. the proffering of languaging or template.
    16  the mess and its overcoming
entanglement as regime intrusions, conflicting biomes, collapse or
implosion, niche-construction, problems of scale in space and time.
    17  phenomenology of touch
    18  recirculation of domain
    19  immersive and definable structures
    20  clue skeins
clues related theoretically, taxonomically, in terms of typifications,
taxonomies - heuristic skeins, established on the run.
    21  the instrumental reason of flows and part-objects
    22  gestural logics and superimpositions
    23  delaying conclusions and the settling-in of elements
    24  continuous processing and absorption of anomalies
    25  modes of approach in space and time
    26  horizons of 'natural' and 'unnatural' worlds
    27  weakening of perceptual structures and responses
    28  releasement and listening
    29  buildings, dwellings, and habitations
    30  the neighborhood
    31  intersecting populations and worlds
    32  phenomenology of withdrawal
    33  the skein (skew-orthogonal)
    34  the skein (askew and local)
    35  increasing audacity and circumscription
    36  the report
    37  the distribution
    38  the thinking of it
    39  the world of it

George Thompson, sir,

The ego has landed.

Permit me to ask, respectfully, sir -- are you not, indeed, an
ornithologist? one who freely admits to be indigenous himself to a place --
philosophy, precisely? where you invented new features that you yourself
perceived by binoculars and adopted as your own? Do you not drive a land
cruiser?

"Well," you begin. "Well, I" -- so you continue. This is how you proceed,
sir. Well, *I adopted* -- your words, indeed, your very words! It may be
well, sir, indeed, that you adopted. Indeed! "Well, I," is how you began all
this just now, and yet, in truth, *I adopted*, is your final meaning. "I
adopted," is your commitment. You admit this, plainly. You shall not be
hedged on this admission. You have adopted that, you say, which is
indigenous, you announce, very specifically, *to philosophy*. Very good. I
challenge anyone to say it differently, or do better. Sir, I am with you.

And this is not, *not by far*, reckless, nor needlessly arbitrary, such
decision-making on your part. I sense the distance in those words I have
just used -- "by far...." "Far be it," you even say, your words now, you
have taken them, and I find them now, a little farther down in your post. I
challenge anyone to deny it. "It," the word you use, sir. "Far be it from
me," you say very precisely there, sir -- that is the expression you use.

You cannot, in good conscience, reverse course! You have adopted. You have
invented. These are irreversible. You must adapt now. You must stick with
them, *for better or worse* -- I must stress here that these are your very
words. This is your expression, sir, "for better or worse," this very day.
It is the adoption you speak of: "for better or worse." Brave words! Be it
well then, that you have adopted a term. Be it so in History of Religions.
Let the adoption proceed. I ask you whether Mrs Saltzman^Òs cabbage is not
"stuffed with advice," in today^Òs For Better Or Worse -- for better or
worse. Accept what the term may bring, "ahamkara" of

Hello All,

I've been unable to keep up with every hydra-like limb of the ever-expanding
"what is Language poetry?" thread, FASCINATING though it is, but nonetheless
would like to toss my "two cents," as it's said, into the bottomless wishing
pit. Some of you might recall me raising the question of what the word
"materialist" means in certain literary contexts. I believe that answering
this question would help unlock the "secret" of the history of the equal
signs that we will never stop trying to solve (picture rat in cage pressing
cocaine-dispensing lever). I wrote some notes down in response to Barrett
Watten's post a few days ago but am currently unable to formulate coherent
sentences so I just made them into a poem:



LISTSERV


don't remember much but
     (life is too long)
multi-authorship
   material text
Watten this is a fake mystery
like defining literarity
    one answer is to do it
sociological--not some
poetic essence
     idealist reading of the listserv
   no progress back in 1990
structural-textual
--the structure gonna make it all right
       confused with
sociological-ideological
collaboration leads to listserv
so the Internet becomes the
ideal text--hypermedia
--economic and socio-ignored
like surrealism--group ideology
over--values     (total failure
of teaching)
      spiritual thing--our souls
and what it means to be alive
on a planet we have loved
       and hated



All right, I did read Watten's Secret History essay a while back and don't
remember almost anything from it except what seems to be happening again here
(and maybe some people are already commenting on it) -- this conflation of
language, poem, text, and discourse and the socio-structural means by which
literary communities are formed, the poetry products distributed, the
positions in "the field" secured and so on. The "what is language poetry?"
question needs to separated into two questions -- Who are/were the language
poets and what is their history, trajectory, position in the "field of
cultural production" and then what, if any, are the foundational, requisite
traits and qualities that differentiate a language poem from all the other
stuff. Two distinct questions. One sociological and one literary.

This brings us to the question of "materiality." The conflation I mentioned
above appears in Patrick Durgin's 'Traditions' essay
(www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~pdurgin/Traditions.htm) and reading this was what
first made me question this term. (Yes, the essay does criticize Dale Smith
and that is not why I am bringing it up; if you got a problem with Dale call
up someone else who also does and bond). Durgin goes back and forth between
using "materiality"or rather "materialist poetics" and "materialist critique"
to describe systems of publishing and circulation and (as if they were =) the
actual words on the page. At one moment he talks about Chain's "materialist
poetics" via their genre-identified issues: "Hybrid Genres, "Letters," etc.
and then later uses the same term or its close cousin "materialist project"
to describe the practice of 'inhabiting (public) space', i.e. publishing
(Patrick's a publisher by the way, publishers needs poetics, too). L=A
magazine is described as "sponsorship of lineage, ideologies (in the plural),
and discrete works from a variety of traditions, at the level of language."
I'm not sure what that means but it seems that "materialist" just means
publishing shit (at the level of language)....

"the deeply poignant aspiration to create space for material expression
within an aesthetic-materialist project"

I think that is the best definition of Language poetry history has so far
produced.

Any more dick poems? What about more nature (immaterial) poems? Tell me what
I'm doing wrong!!

thanks for letting me rant,
dave

Hi

i want to make of those apologies in advance in respect of cross-posting.

things not worth keeping are proud to announce:

=8CThe Books=B9, the first in a planned series of 10 (subscription only)
publications over the next two-three years.

Chapter 1 : The Gathering

Every chapter in the series will be produced in the same square format (20c=
m
x 20cm) and in full colour throughout -  24pp featuring 10 composed
double-page spreads building towards a 240pp full-colour artwork. The serie=
s
presents a continuous narrative that weaves documentation and fiction into =
a
radical version, not a conclusion, of =8CThe Books=B9 project. We=B9re working
with the conversations we like to imagine between artists=B9 books, graphic
novels/poems and contemporary poetics.

We=B9ve been working with this material since the autumn of 1998 - through a
number of installation, performance and web based occurrences, some of whic=
h
you may have already heard about, witnessed or even participated in. More
details are online at www.thingsnotworthkeeping.com. The work explores and
makes explicit ideas about collaboration.

We have just begun a targetted mail-out of the free launch issue intended t=
o
generate subscribers and sponsors for the rest of the series. We have a
number of blank envelopes remaining.

IF you would like to receive the invite package - including the free first
issue  -  and IF you are a series candidate to become an individual or
institutional subscriber / sponsor (the rates are not at all prohibitive :
=A340 with a =A330 concessionary rate for all 10 books, separate rates for
sponsors and institutions) then b/c us your address and we'll get them in
the post this week. We're stressing this indication of serious intent as
they are expensive to produce and we're not able to give away endless
freebies. I might add that 'the books' will not be available for separate
purchase.=20

looking forward

cris cheek and kirsten lavers (on behalf of things not worth keeping)

Hello,

My last post went out to the list before it was finished.  I must have hit
the send button instead of the save button.  So the abruptness of that post
was unintended.  If it has made you bristle, please forgive me.

Really, I'm not interested in flyting with you.  It is all just a little

Shuffle off to Buffalo, where there are two schools...town ("Just Buffalo"
and associates) and gown (State University of New York's English Department
program in "poetics").  Gown almost never talks to town.  And town might
like to converse with gown but no one's made a bridge.  No invitations come
from the big "u" to town. This, despite there being the "Just Buffalo
Literary Center and despite Carl Dennis, who just won the Pulitzer. I
suspect similar formations exist throughout the country.  I wouldn't say
that they are distinct schools as in types or sorts of poetry or pottery
etc.  There is variation.  Although it's usually the critics who dub them
"schools."

materialist question depends on relation betwen thought and being.  if
thought creates being, idealism. if being crates thought, materialsm.

Language Poetry

Yea, it was pundit debunking, sage with newness,
Meaty ruse, elaborate masquerade of unmeaning,

Stage where words pose counterpoised to signification,

Where rummy syllables string along kinks of syntax


And gum of virgules jimmies together clauses
To devise a monument of fistulous happenstance,

Subverting address for free play^×
Rare vestiges pitched headlong in stochastic

Eddies, dreaming a livelong laterality,
Polygons alongside tapirs in grammar-shorn dance^×

Slithered mid-speech an intention a seam
The color of politics, even the furthest minutia

Run on dollars, come what cannot until (s)pace
Breaks into half itself &

Music the bramble where bare verbs rabble,
Seeking the iota behind the bestial bars

That proves no forged lattice girds the mind
With predicates efficacious as prison searchlights^×

Senses slip the faster usurps fate from syntax
How kowtow to solipsism or preset a page?

-Ravi Shankar

Chris:  For the past two days, messages that I sent in
reply to List postings are not appearing.  Here is the
body of the ~third~ message of mine that the 'bots are
not letting through, if you could post it, please.
Any idea why all these tech problems and rejected and
vanished postings, now that the List is unmoderated?
Thanks.  --- Jeffrey

Date:         Tue, 23 Apr 2002 22:06:38 -0400
From:         Barrett Watten <b.watten@WAYNE.EDU>
Subject:      What Is?

> First, what kind of question is being asked?

......................................................


I bought and have been reading that issue of ~Qui
Parle,~ mainly the remarkable Steve Evans essay on a
metaphysics or Hegelian ontology of "new meaning,"---
but also the Ben Friedlander's haunted house prose,
moving on to Lytle Shaw on Frank O'Hara.

One "connection" I thought I sensed for the
Friedlander was between it and, an odd comparison, the
journal PomPom, or, for that matter, the Pledge of
Allegiance poems that Michael Magee read from his new
book at Double Happiness, or Craig Dworkin's new book
based on a grammar manual.  Magee's were "homophonic
translations" from English to English of the words
from the Pledge of Allegiance, a Raymond Roussel-like
re-casting of similar-sounding words in the same
order.  (Ben Friedlander acknowledges Roussel.)  The
Dworkin book is described as taking a grammar manual
and plotting it out by parts of speech, and then
substituting new words into all those diagrammed
sentences.  Friedlander took a Jean Wahl essay and
performed similar word-for-word substitutions,
replacing the names of Existentialists with the names
of Language Poets and key words with new concepts.
"Facts" are abrogated, and it becomes very difficult
to tell what's a valid statement and what's a
synthetic illusion. The journal PomPom is predicated
on each new issue's contributors taking the poems of
the first or previous issues as their models and
writing some type of emulation, imitation, or
spin-off.

Out of this small sample, a consistency should be
becoming apparent: a literature where the antecedent
text carries a grave, compelling and dictating
guidance over the writing of the new text.  A
literature of palimpsest or copying, Xerox Poetry,
where the preceding, instead of being "rebelled"
against and overthrown, is followed slavishly.  These
examples seem to betray at least one consistency in
what younger generation, "POST-Language" poets are
doing.

Coincidentally, Mister Kazim Ali's post about the new
edition of Hejinian's ~My Life,~ and reading the new
text in suspenseful anticipation of the differences
between it and the previous version.

This "post-Language"/Xerox current in new writing can
be further emblematized into how, unlike the usual, a
new generation is reacting to a previous--- or ~not~
reacting.  In a sense, the "Anxiety of Influence" is
peculiarly missing, or sublated, or, at any rate,
~odd~ and different from normal Oedipal rebellion.
There's something of an extreme holding onto what has
passed before, a blurring into it, a willing inability
to differentiate child from parent: clone poetics.
Maybe this happens with Adult Children of Alcoholics,
where the child was burdening with being the sensible
caretaker of dysfunctional latterday Hippies.

These are like bad simulacra.

Like those species of hungry flora that overcome their
insect prey by adapting into a perfect resemblance to
it.


Where this leaves the question under discussion, "What
is Language Poetry?", much as Barrett Watten says, is
another empty center or excluded middle, which, once
that blue dwarf has collapsed, leaves very different
questions: What is ~not~ Language Poetry?

Underline this one:  How is Language Poetry ~not~
Language Poetry?

How are we, how can we be, and ~do~ we want to be
~not~ Language Poetry, now that that ~idee fixe~
dominates the entire poetic psyche like an obsessive
compulsion?

The bad conscience of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry's having
misappropriated the '80s one moral equal sign: SILENCE
= DEATH.

Translated into less logical colloquialism, where the
question really is happening, I think, is in a
struggle that asks: how can all these contradictory,
dissimilar poetries remain misguidingly lumped
together under the one unilluminating rubric?  (The
Californian New Sentence-ism of a Rae Armantrout
should no longer even be on ~the same map~ as East
Coast Andrews paratacticism, the two are so
[dialectically] opposed.)  How can we be such poor
readers as to call "pluribus" "unum"?  (The widened
gap between female and male Language Poets, where, to
oversimplify, Scalapino, Armantrout and Howe, to name
three, have always retained ~strong~ autobiographical
sources throughout their work that completely belie
Glazier's Doctrine of The Non-Innovative "I": by
surface contrast, the men have been eradicating every
possible trace of matrilineal/familial succession.)

Enough time has passed, for anybody who's been keeping
up with The Good Fight, so that what was once
difficult, shocking, and hermetic now reads
transparently, self-evident, an alternative
normativity.  It's becoming harder to hide, and the
personal self now gapes out of almost every Language
text, the way a housepet like a cat will play at
hiding by poking its head under a chair, leaving its
whole conspicuous backside sticking out from behind
and tail swinging in the air.

The propulsion behind the question, I think, is:
cannot we yet get past this distorting generalization,
put it aside completely, and begin speaking in
~sub-sets~ of Language Poetry --- the Zaum-ists (P.
Inman, Melnick's ~Pcoet,~ a little bit of every Howe
book), the aforementioned extremist paratactics, the
unanchored but coherent clause poetry [I'm not a very
good taxonomist at this point], the didactic Essay on
Poetry sermonizers (Perelman, some Bernstein, ~A
Border Comedy~), --- so that those sub-species can in
turn be bridged more helpfully back into the entire
weave of the avant-garde or poetry in general, with
which, once unsegregated, they bear strong
commonalities?

That is, the question then becomes:

What is Language Poetry once we ~stop~ calling it
Language Poetry?  Where does it go and what does the
poetry turn into?

Without that mythic term, like The Areopagites (a
non-existent hypothetical "school" of early
Elizabethans, Spenser and Marvell), the reading
experience, the literary history, and even The Wars
become quite different.  Language Poetry, like the
Marxist state, is being phased out of its ontology by
a literary Fall of The Wall.

The question has a null point because the term was
always predicated on negations: ~not~ self-oriented,
~not~ confessionalist, ~not~ discursive.

Language Poetry was the Un-Cola of poetries.

You only know what it is if you realize it something
else than what you're calling it.

We are aware that a few subscribers have been able to post to the list over
the past week to two weeks (the problem seems to be variable), and
apologize for the inconvenience. I have examined all of the subscriptions
in question and can't figure out what the problem might be; everything
appears to be quite normal from this side. The usual routine of un- and
resubbing - the listerv version of hitting it with a hammer - hasn't worked
in any of these cases. We have referred the problem to the people who
maintain the listserv server at UB's Computing and Information Technology
office, and await word from them. Thanks for your patience in the interim.

Please post to the Poetics List - thank you very much.

All the sequels to the book-length poem Stubborn Grew (Spuyten Duyvil,
2000) have now been published in one volume, titled The Rose.  This book
consolidates previous books (Grassblade Light, July, and one section of
Island Road).  So the complete long poem (known as Stubborn Grew/The Rose,
or, Forth of July) is now available in these two volumes.  See the XLibris
website listed below for more information.

steve mccaffery, karen mac cormack, nicolle brossard, maggie o'sullivan are
good examples.
collaborative projects among poets from other 'traditions'/ languages
attests that.

IS LIKE PEOPLE WHO SAY ICE HOCKEY

Using the term 'language poetry' is like people who say 'ice hockey' --
there is a recognition of medium as essential to process

'Materialist,' I would hope, affords *parallel attention* to the world
that seems vs. the world that is

Below you will find the manifesto for my new poetry movement: Non-Language
Poetry.  The Non-Language Poets will no longer consent to use words-except
when they have to.

ss

A Test of Poetry

Cut out a strip of paper &
     draw a line down the middle
of the strip.  Join the two ends
     of the strip to make a circle.
Now the line you drew will
     run along the circumference,
either outside or inside the
     circle, one or the other.

Cut another strip of paper
     the same size.  Give the strip
a half-twist, 180 degrees, before
     you join the ends together.

Now you have a Mobius strip.
     Start anywhere along this strip
& begin to draw a line.  You'll
     end up back where you started,
without ever having to lift your
     pencil off the paper.
Your mind will loop into itself
     & the world will loop
into your mind as you move that pencil.
     There is no outside, no inside,
only the flow of this single unending curve.
        Perhaps this is poetry.

Dying? I'm not so sure about this particular word choice, as many
living figure-heeds of said movements are well, living.   "Death" as a trope
for thinking about literary movements suggests a beginning and ending
that they do not, seems to me from here, have.  Instead, they grow,
change, take lines of flight, yes? Actually, this difference is key to the
said movements.  How about transforming?  Then, the question is, into
whats and wheres are these various schools of poetry transforming.  ?

This also sounds like a candidate for my Fake Langugage Poetry movement.
The Fakelangpo web site is in the works...  (However I am having technical
problems.  Has anyone here ever used phpnuke or myphpnuke to build a site?
I'm having installation trouble...)

(By the way, it is not in the slightest bit nasty or offensive (I hope) to
te real language poetry; it is simply a different view which holds that good
language poetry is poetry which is fun to read, and that we are allowed to
use critical words like "good" and "fun" instead of "polysemy" (which was
one I never fogured out), etc.

A Test of Poetry

Cut out a strip of paper &
     draw a line down the middle
of the strip.  Join the two ends
     of the strip to make a circle.
Now the line you drew will
     run along the circumference,
either outside or inside the
     circle, one or the other.

Cut another strip of paper
     the same size.  Give the strip
a half-twist, 180 degrees, before
     you join the ends together.

Now you have a Mobius strip.
     Start anywhere along this strip
& begin to draw a line.  You'll
     end up back where you started,
without ever having to lift your
     pencil off the paper.
Your mind will loop into itself
     & the world will loop
into your mind as you move that pencil.
     There is no outside, no inside,
only the flow of this single unending curve.
        Perhaps this is poetry.

Funny you should use that word: "death."  The death of
the avant-garde / the death of poetry.

Some people don't like to be called "dead," of course,
but---

Following a footnote in Barrett Watten's ~Secret
History~ essay, I've been awaiting the recall of my
library's copy of Paul Mann's ~Theory-Death of the
Avant-Garde~ (yum!) and, in the meantime, reading an
on-line version of his ~Masocriticism,~ which gives a
summary of what the preceding theory-death meant.
I'm finding the idea to be quite envigorating! (yet at
the same time bleak) and to help cast almost
everything of American avant-garde poetry into relief.

[I provide interesting sample quotes from the book at
the bottom of this post.]

Here's my interpretation of what ~Masocriticism~ says
about theory-death:

It takes as its starting point the old adage --- old
but said from so many different corners that it starts
to take on an insistent truth by consensus of its
reiteration --- that
the avant-garde is dead.  And from there, it goes on
to explain ~how~ the avant-garde is dead (and still
continuing at the same time).  As best I can make out,
his idea is that, once avant-gardes are recuperated
back into the over-all exchange system of the
"capitalism"
that they come out of, that is, by becoming
"alternative tradition" canonical, in museums, or
sold, ---the avant-garde and capitalism being
symbiotic (capitalism having needed the avant-garde to
fuel it with new, exploitable inventiveness),--- the
avant-gardes are stripped of all their original
~ideological~ context and significance.  Homogenized,
kind of, so that basically all that remains of them
are their structural or design differences, but with
the politics and theory gone out of it.  There's the
theory-death.

(An applied example of this might be how surrealism
and Dada and Futurism and Russian zaum, to name only a
few, all stand leveled on the same plane now: the
surrealism of Breton's "l'amour fou" where an almost
crimes of passion but private berserk love was the
revolutionary catalyst, the surrealism of the
Communist Party surrealists or Breton with Trotsky,
the fascism behind Italian Futurism, the Russian
avant-gardes as agents of an implemented revolutionary
government, etc., are all elided into exercises in
style, with the pits removed.   Without their
ideological-theory components, all those avant-gardes
and their artworks have lost an indispensable
dimension of their significance,

. . . like preserving a national anthem or flags
without knowing which country they belonged to.)

He sees the avant-garde as having existed from 1871 to
May 1968, between the two French revolutions.  (Again,
dated very close to the other "the avant-garde is
dead" proponents, who ground its disappearance, for
example, in the economic absoprtion of the bourgeois
class that gave rise to it by opposition, or even
post-modernity dating its inception a decade or so
later [with the demolition of that Modernist classic
building, etc]) .

The paradox of a dead avant-garde still continuing and
even proliferating: the very repetition ~is~ the death
principle that's driving it post mortem.  There's a
Freudian equation between the death principle and
repetition compulsion, where the sameness or stasis
that repetition compulsion pursues is a zero state of
identity, and that zero is death.

He compares it to de Sade's repetitive, endlessly
generating sentences.  Kind of
like a zombie avant-garde, where the very fact that
it's still going is proof that it's ~really, really~
dead.  If it weren't dead, it would've laid down or
stopped by now.


Of course, this notion of "dead" might be expressed
with another term.  (But which?)

This gratifying theory-death seems quite plausible if
not self-evident to me.  Death has never prevented
literatures from continuing.  Neo-Latin poetry, for
instance, extended well beyond the Middle Ages, even
into the early twentieth century among some Italian
scholastics (the neo-Latin poet whom Saussure
corresponded with, believing he'd found hypogrammes in
his writing) and, for centuries, English poetry and
neo-Latin poetry were produced in parallel, the latter
usually coming first in a poet's career, so that half
of the canon's poetry is sealed off to us (the Latin
poetry of Milton, of Marvell, of Marlowe).  See the
morbidity of New Formalism's dry bones.  Perhaps an
even better example (since neo-Latin poetry was dead
by virtue of its vocabulary being a dead language's
whereas now the dead avant-garde still uses a living
English) might be philosophy, which didn't listen to
its Hegelian death knell, didn't even quite let
Heideggerian twilight bury it, and which, regardless,
as least by Wittgensteinian linguistic skepticism, was
always operating, in metaphysics and ontology, without
any real circulatory system, just sort of a haunted
house of grammatically uprooted ghost words like
"being" or "essence."

This theory-death seems a useful key to me in that it
gives a unique standard of measurement for otherwise
difficult-to-explain Deterioration-like profusions:
the aforementioned Xerox Poetry, for example, is a
sort of Shroud of Turin of the exterminated original.
It allows it to be asked, of the possible means of
sustenance, how much literary ~necrophilia~ is the
driving force.

As in The Prsistent Achaicism, something that deserves
attention.  To seize upon just the convenient example
of the lastest posted new e-journal as a test case,
http://www.wordforword.info : among fourteen writers,
we find ---in no way disparaging the very good, good
poetry there: "medieval streets in context" (history
as the preserved dead) or the dead spot of inheritted
lyrical sentimentality, "the melancholy voices of
these green woods" [William Allegrezza]; haikus
hundred of years after their vitality; the
dead/archaic Elizabethan diction of "And the solution
of contynuyte called ecchymosis in / greke commeth
most often" [Braden]; Martin Corless-Smith, who has
made dead book English his trademark style, and who,
in the particular wordforword poem, reenacts the
manifestation of dead zones by making overstruck
cancelations (deletions) the whole trope of the piece;
the robotic lifelessness of Jukka-Pekka Kervinen's
computer-generated collages; the dead neo-classicism
of "from Philomela to Procne" [McCollough] or "it is
unlawful says Hypnos" [Mulrooney]; pure zero drive
repetition compulsion in David Pavelich's rearranged
lines (see Braden); an elegy of Shakespeare's in the
title "Full Fathom Five" and perhaps the most thorough
Final Days of all the poetry in Jon Thompson's
extremely crepuscular poetry: "The Sense of Ending,"
"ghostly remnants of old fables," etc.  (Again: this
autopsy analysis is in no way a condemnation of the
poetry's commendable strengths: rigidity,
petrifaction, fossilization, vampirism ^Å)

The avant-garde may have been dead so long now that
it's finally beginning to show, in a myriad of ways.
This flat-lining and absent pulse is good news, I
think, because for the first time it allows other
~seeming~ growths to be seen for what they are:
disintegration as dispersal . . .

Cheerfully,


Quotes from ~Masocriticism~:

:

.......................................................

Now this diagnosis suggests, first of all, that the
avant-garde's death was not
 an event that occurred at the end of a long and
healthy life: from the very
 outset everything it produced was its death;
everything it produced delivered
 it into the arms of an economy in which death itself
can be reproduced as a
 commodity.

....

Capital feeds off of the avant-garde; its perpetual
death helps keep the monster
 of capital alive. That is why the death of the
avant-garde must not be confused
 with any termination, any closure, which has not yet
occurred and will never
 occur as long as the culture of capital persists. The
death of the avant-garde is
 not its end but its repetition, indeed its compulsive
repetition.

...

But at the same time, as the death of the avant-garde
makes manifest, in this
 culture one can also die by speaking. One can also
play into the hands of a
 generalized violence against secrecy.

...

It is here that one begins to imagine another
monstrous order in which the
 equation of silence and death is not rejected but
embraced, in which the
 deepest necessity is to seek this silence and death.

 One imagines such a silence so that one's own writing
will become untenable.
 Under the sign of silence and death, writing turns
against itself with enormous
 fury; it becomes a kind of masocriticism, if you
will, subjecting itself to the
 laws of the discursive economy it loathes in order to
inflict upon itself an
 unprecedented suffering that will make writing, as
long as it continues,
 impossible.

..

[de Sade] He would have no interest in the avant-garde
attempt to
 dismantle bourgeois art only to reassemble its
elements once more within the
 discursive economy, within Art and Culture, in the
moribund form of the
 aesthetic commodity. It is because culture is, like
Frankenstein, so adept at
 such reassemblies, at reproducing phantasms of life
from the scattered limbs
 of the dead, that a second death must occur, an
afterlife that is the first
 encounter with death, a death carried out, in Sade's
work, by the continuous
 production of sentences, sentences that are always
punctuated as death
 sentences.

The death of the author? It has long been a critical
cliché. But the lesson of
 Sade is that the only author whose death matters is
the author of the text one
 writes.

Various comments have been out forth on this issue including mine the =
other night: I had consumed some ales so not sure what I was talking =
about. But for me the L=3DA=3DN=3DG  movement was a novelty in 1992 when =
"introduced" to it via a course on American Poetry and Poetics at =
Auckland University run by Wystan Curnow, Roger Horrocks, Michelle =
Leggott, Murray Edmond, and at that time Alan Loney gave a lecture (he =
was the visiting poet, or poet in residence, and is a poet and =
publisher). Loney talked then of the importance to him of Olson: his =
"open field" literally had - I think he was saying - a liberating effect =
on his own writing and praxis. For me the whole course at Auck Uni was =
good and much of it new and as someone who had "returned" to poetry and =
literature (after years as a "family man" and a "worker") the whole =
thing "came out of the blue" but since then I've  attempted to keep up =
with innovative work  - whether it is card-carrying language poetry or =
more "traditional" or something that may have developed in parrallel or =
in similar ways or owes something to that movement - or is not related =
at all and is simply interesting.  I think that it was and is a greatly =
significant movement. The questions now arising are how it is =
developing, what people are influenced by it: which are say the most =
interesting mags publishing writing close to this "current", some =
speculation on the future and so on. Even in "in the American Tree" or a =
more general book "Postmodern American Poetry" by Hoover there is an =
enormous variation of writing going on. The movement though is a closer =
"knit" group than say the NY School and so on. Generally in New Zealand =
if people talk about poetry outside New Zealand they refer to Ted =
Hughes, Seamus Heaney and people of his ilk. Some may be aware of =
Geoffrey Hill, and those better "versed" may know of David Jones, or =
Prynne or even Raworth. But as to American poets the names sought are =
the "beats" such as Ginsberg. There may be some knowledge of Olson: =
people will know of Plath...rarely is John Ashbery mentioned: but =
certainly Bukowski and Kerouac etc are extremely popular. Very few =
people even in the 'literary world" know anything of the Language Poets. =
(Mind you in NZ as anywhere there are worlds within worlds and various =
intersections: we are not talking clear cut circular diagrams, so to =
speak)  (Of course I'm talking not of people whose "life is literature", =
now most of those will have some knowledege of this movement when there =
they "approve" of it is a different question.) (These are =
generalisations of course.)
   Now when I give readings I have  sometimes some "more languagy poems" =
which have been written for fun: in fact they fit in easily with kind of =
rapid "inspirational" writing I do. Usually the "purely" language poems =
I read are received with bafflement: I suspect that some people conclude =
I'm a mad Univeristy professor or just a madman from the bush.  Well, =
I'm probably a slightly eccentric but mostly ordinary person from the =
suburbs! But not always are people "baffled", there are people who =
frequenty thank me for what i ahve read, so sometimes "ecstatic clamour =
and ovation"is the reaction. Its interesting though that my often more =
"trad" poems simply dont work much...
  The reason for this I think is - and I think this points to one thing =
that Langpo is "trying to do" - is that one slips into 'auto-poetic' =
that is, an audience who are used to and enjoy my "crazy prose poems " =
etc , hear the "old" sounds, the slide toward the familiar, the slip =
into the slush of what may start to sound (altough  this audience is not =
thinking consciously:  "ah! official verse culture!" I doubt) too much =
like poetry of some  too consciously trying to be a poet: bad Dylan =
Thomas ...Thomas was a great poet but: what the audience wants is =
something that is not rhyhming, (I mean that is not trutely sing-songy) =
non  histrionic, and in some way intellectually challenging. This is not =
to annul emotive force and so on (or certain fundamental poetic devices =
and experiences.): the point here is that both trite or "tired" habits =
of reading writing often result when the "old" way of writing is used =
(that said, I;m aware of the problematics here; that language poetry of =
a kind also starts (or can start) to sound "samey"... so "new" =
strategies of writing are constantly called for (if not required =
instantly)...But I dont mean poetry that has inwoven some complex schema =
or "message'  a la eg Celan.  Now he's a good example because I just =
re-read Pierre Joris's translation of the Celan poem which deals with =
his visit to Heidegger.Now that is quite brilliant (Joris's translation =
and the poem and the insights). Paradoxically, this lead me to a =
philosopical dictionary and I read about Heidegger. Now I think that I'm =
 (more) in agreement (insofar as I can see what Heidegger is talking =
abut re being and being in the world and so on (this time): this after I =
had more or less dismissed him (when first  I "encountered" his writing) =
with the "feel" of Heidegger's writing than I was before - when i was =
more skeptical or  dubious, partly for the Nazi connection but also when =
I first read some of his things I was philosophically more supportive of =
technology - I'm still dubious of his strange attitude to technology, =
but that gets back to the "nature" debate, and I'm already digressing =
too much! - and dubious of his very obscure and abstract language): but =
to return to Celan: his poetry would be impossible to do justice to in  =
a public reading (maybe "impossible" is too strong here - the reality is =
more complex re public or other readings (aloud) of poetry and =
performence - the whole area is problematic), but  the reason  is that =
(even for a German audience; an appreciative and attentive one, may =
subtle nuances and deep etymylogical meanings and so on would be lost: =
this doesnt mean that Celan reading (or reading his poetry aloud or to =
an audience) would be a waste of time...in fact what I'm saying applies =
in varying degrees to virtually any poetry..as each audience and each =
member of each audience brings more or less knowledge of the poem's =
subject as well as "reading expernce" and or life experience and =
sensibility to a poem being presented or read. In fact, the point is =
that, both a kind of poetry that was kind of "of the cuff" and or ludic =
and had no subtle or deep meaning or twists and turns would probably =
signify (if its poetic quality and intensity of its "linguistic-emotive" =
pressure were in there in the writing) as significantly and beautifully =
- to use a fraught term - as the poem with "complex designs or ulterior =
motives(!)" ....
    Now with (most) of the poems I write I approach (or have attemped to =
approach, if I've attempted anything) a kind of "higher music" where an =
expository appreciation of the poem is less useful than a "poetic mind =
responding" to a magical-pseudo-logical 'construction' or 'work' whose =
sum-total may have some "meaning" but which is by and large sui generis: =
which is not to say non-meaningful or non referential, but certainly the =
way it "means" or tries to be or mean convey is poetic. This is not to =
say "good" or great" or even "bad"  - just that that is the kind of =
writing it is.  Heidegger, and I'm "cheating" here, as the works I've =
read by him dont include "Being and Time" and I dont have a great =
knowledge of philosophy, is said to a have come to think thus (accoding =
to the Oxford Companion to Philosophy: "The appropriate response to =
being is thinking. Thinking is our obedient answer to the call of =
being:the early Greeks did it, but we have forgotten it. Thinking =
contrasts with assertion, logic, science ('science does not think'), =
metaphysics, philosophy itself, and especially technology, which is =
merely an instrument for aclculation and domination of =
entities...Language...[becomes, or speaks as] the ' abode of being' ... =
Poetry is not a secondary phenomenom: it has a special relation to being =
and truth. Poetry is 'founding of truth':it discloses the (or 'a') world =
and creates a language for its adequate expression..."  Now I'm well =
aware of the danger of tis kind, of Heidegger's way, of philosophy, =
which in fact is more like a kind of poetry (in fact Bernstein's essay =
"Writing and Method" calls into question or problematises where poetry =
begins and philosophy ends and vice versa: but I think that Heidegger =
was dogged ofter the problem of being in time and it is an important, or =
if not an important, at least (and) fascinating question (Eliot pursues =
it via St Augustine in "Burnt Norton")): like Hegel he is an =
fundamentally "Idealist" philosopher....but that aside, through Celan =
(and especially with such an engrossing exposition as that by Joris), =
I've connected to Heidegger and the possiblity of thinking about the =
world (quite soberly) and thinking about a world in a "poetic" way, and =
one of the key things here is Heidegger's concept that poetry and art =
(not science) are moved more to centre stage as ways to interpret the =
world: however, as Joris points out, it appears that the subtlety of =
Celan's poem was wasted on Heidegger! Which brings us back to politics =
and the  political -social significations of literrature and language: =
and thus also their emotive and psychological significance. These are =
not trivial. The language that Celan had to use (or felt he had to use) =
was German, now his parents were killed by Germans: but Celan did not =
dismiss Heidegger's philosophy. The opacity of Celan's subtly nuanced =
language meant that ts meaning evaded Heidegger: which nearly cuts the =
ground from under Heidegger the champion of "poetic thinking" - hoist by =
his own petard - but Celan was also at "fault" for his complexity: or =
was he...the reality is that we are "trapped in  language" ... and =
Celan's agony points to questions that lead to the reason or the rasiosn =
d'etre of or for language poetry: Heidegger's philosophy struggles with =
time and being and process: which process is seen in the work of an =
important influence on the Langauge poets, Gertrude Stein...
    I'm not arguin for any particular "type" or "style" of poetry or for =
or against "opacity"  - a better term is Bernstiens absorption-anti =
absorption as in "A Posetics"...
    Its a paradox that I could probably "cut up" (well any one could) =
parts of Heidegger's writings (possibly leaving in some of he German =
words in even whilst my German is very very limited) and eevn graft it =
onto some Celan and other "stuff" and yet: this mish mash, this =
seeming-meaning, this meaningful meaninglessness, I could convey to an =
audience:it  would probably still hold its fascination, the fascination =
of concepts coming into being, the music.
  And the music would still be there, read out aloud or not, latent. The =
word, the latent word: potent, building - perpetually possible.   =

THE RED BIRD, by Joyelle McSweeney, winner of the 2001 Fence Modern Poets
Series, selected and with a foreword by Allen Grossman

"The Red Bird has more in common with a fast red car, except that it does,
indeed, fly. Within its agile slips and twists, McSweeney has managed a
rare insight, casting our own historical moment as the postmodern medieval,
full of knights running errands, where Machu Piccu, Radio Sucre, and lawn
chairs all take on Biblical proportions. Except that it's really Darwin
we're talking about, as he careens around the globe. She deflates this and
other old battles by giving us new terms: 'O beautiful he produceth /
language from everyplace / on his body. . .' This is a stunning first book.
It glows in the dark."
- Cole Swensen

"[McSweeney's] poems are neither reductive nor fantastic. But they are
profoundly mysterious in the way any truthful account of the world must be.
Joyelle McSweeney is a poet with a vocation-
a calling to the world. What is given her (the vocation) is to make others
see what is given her to see."
- Allen Grossman

CAN YOU RELAX IN MY HOUSE, by Michael Earl Craig

"I like being in the world of Michael Craig's poems. Anything can happen,
and probably will, and it will affect me in small or large ways that I
couldn't have imagined. The precision of their imagery keeps me reeling
with delight."- James Tate


Montgomery

He wore a beautiful hat in massive mahogany
which he unscrewed and set on the bureau.
He loosened his tie and walked over
to the window; from there he could see
down into the courtyard where his dog was
tied, in the rain, to a tall hedge.
He kept his back to the room:
a silver probang lay on a black cushion;
a jar of tongue depressors; various calipers;
an old-looking telephone
with what looked to be white icing on the mouthpiece.

Montgomery tapped the ash off his cigar.
He cleared his throat and spoke: "No.
I said I saw a pile of hurdles
behind the meat plant." The nurse
held her clipboard defensively.
She nodded. She wrote: "Is
quite handsome. Is in need of a bath."

Fence Books and Fence Magazine are delighted to announce the winner of the
2002 Alberta Prize:
The Real Moon of Poetry and Other Poems, by Tina Celona, to be published in
the fall of 2002 by Fence Books (http://www.fencebooks.com)

Tina Celona's darkly lucid, lightly comic poems are unusually explicit in
their attentiveness to the primacy of poetry as a force akin to that of the
tides or their correlative lunar cycle. Describing in clear, unabstracted
terms such elements of the quotidian as war, freedom, dream,
"Satisfaction," and imagination, Celona invokes poems and their poet with
the same degree of focused intensity as she does more obvious, more
conventionally useful objects such as Singer sewing machines, shrimp,
straw, driveways, corpses. The result is not so much an elevation as a
leveling, a tableau of meaning in which the poet and her poems achieve a
plastic, spatial, significant reality on the luxuriously detailed plateau
of the natural world: "The cliffs of the/ seabed the/ Poem twisting like a/
Tornado over the/ Plains of the interior/ Decoration."

Tina Brown Celona was born in 1974 to an American Foreign Service Officer
and his Vietnamese wife. She grew up in Tokyo, Paris, Kuala Lumpur, and
Washington, DC, and attended Brown University. In 1996 she moved to Salt
Lake City, UT, then attended the Writer's Workshop at the University of
Iowa. Celona has published a chapbook, Songs & Scores (Spectacular Books).
She lives in East Hampton, New York with her husband, the poet Matt Celona.

DEFOE by Leslie Scalapino has been reprinted by Green Integer, =
EL-E-PHANT 55, $15.95, 228 pages. ISBN # 1-931243-44-1. It is an =
anti-war work. The back cover says: "DEFOE is an epic where images of =
battle become meditations, an epic wherein events flap in silence as the =
narrative moves toward a place where the reader and text become one. The =
images of this fiction don't resemble events, but are new occurrences in =
time and space. In Part I, WAKING LIFE, the heroine, in love with James =
Dean, discovers herself in a desert pocked with fires in which the =
"henna man" - a drug dealer - is being carried in a white cocoon. And =
throughout Scalapino's work the reader is taken into a world where the =
written word creates "an event retrieved from so far back that it is =
separated from memory."

                THE REVIEW OF CONTEMPORARY FICTION  wrote of this book: =
"As a literary work, DEFOE most closely resembles the sort of automatic =
writing pioneered by Breton and Soupault; as a political and =
philosophical critique of contemporary discourse, DEFOE reveals a deep =
affinity with the works of Heidegger and Derrida. But ultimately - =
perhaps most controversially - it is a call to writers to liberate =
themselves from the limits of narrative and embrace a new kind of =
writing."

I'm going to be leading a summer prose workshop out of my San
Francisco (South of Market) apartment--Monday evenings, beginning
early to mid June.  There seems to be more interest than I have room
for, so I'm thinking of adding a second section--just for the
summer--on Saturday afternoons.

The class would last 12 weeks, no assignments, liberal definition of
what constitutes prose.  It's a good place to bring in edgy work.

Please pass this message along to anyone you know who might be interested.

Thanks.

The professional folklorists beat your friends to the mark by about 80
years, and he will be competing with an enormous literature. He should
check out the books by the Opies (husband and wife) for a start--within the
listings at Amazon of all of their books for children  are the real wonders.

isn't the avant-garde always dead?  and isn't that the point.  the
avant-garde is always dead and being replaced by something which will later
be called avant-garde...

What is the new poetry now like?  I want to read that book Eunoia that seems
quite popular only I can never remember the author's name :-) (easy enough
to find though) but more seriously can't find even at bookstores like
labyrinth (I think Jeffrey Jullich lives in my neigghborhood so knows where
I'm talking about) or St. Marks.  I'm gonna try Gotham but it's not that
great on new poetry books and you have to be awake 9-5 to go there....and
it's raining)  see how concrete I can be even though I read Language Poetry
sometimes?  hey what is the most appropriate poem to read in the rain?   I
have two candidtaes, both French but quiote different.  One is Appolinaire's
Caligramme "il pleut" and the Verlaine poem which may be nameless but is the
third pooemin Romances sans Paroles:

                                Il pleure dans mon coeur
                                Comme il pleut sur la ville
                                Quelle est cette langueur
                                Qui penetre mon coeur?

                                O bruit doux de la pluie
                                Par terre et sur les toits!
                                Pour un coeur qui s'ennui
                                O le chant de la pluie!

                                Il pleure sans raison
                                Dans ce coeur qui s'ecoeur
                                Quoi! nulle trahison?
                                Ce deuil est sans raison.

                                C'est bien la pire peine
                                De ne savoir pourquoi,
                                Sans amour et sans haine,
                                Mon coeur a tant de peine.


I think that's one of the best descriptions of (clinical) depression I've
ever read and the beginning is terrific poetry,; it kind of lags after that,
I mean it's still good but not brteathtaking like the first two lines.

Funny you should use that word: "death."  The death of
the avant-garde / the death of poetry.

Some people don't like to be called "dead," of course,
but---

Following a footnote in Barrett Watten's ~Secret
History~ essay, I've been awaiting the recall of my
library's copy of Paul Mann's ~Theory-Death of the
Avant-Garde~ (yum!) and, in the meantime, reading an
on-line version of his ~Masocriticism,~ which gives a
summary of what the preceding theory-death meant.
I'm finding the idea to be quite envigorating! (yet at
the same time bleak) and to help cast almost
everything of American avant-garde poetry into relief.

[I provide interesting sample quotes from the book at
the bottom of this post.]

Here's my interpretation of what ~Masocriticism~ says
about theory-death:

It takes as its starting point the old adage --- old
but said from so many different corners that it starts
to take on an insistent truth by consensus of its
reiteration --- that
the avant-garde is dead.  And from there, it goes on
to explain ~how~ the avant-garde is dead (and still
continuing at the same time).  As best I can make out,
his idea is that, once avant-gardes are recuperated
back into the over-all exchange system of the
"capitalism"
that they come out of, that is, by becoming
"alternative tradition" canonical, in museums, or
sold, ---the avant-garde and capitalism being
symbiotic (capitalism having needed the avant-garde to
fuel it with new, exploitable inventiveness),--- the
avant-gardes are stripped of all their original
~ideological~ context and significance.  Homogenized,
kind of, so that basically all that remains of them
are their structural or design differences, but with
the politics and theory gone out of it.  There's the
theory-death.

(An applied example of this might be how surrealism
and Dada and Futurism and Russian zaum, to name only a
few, all stand leveled on the same plane now: the
surrealism of Breton's "l'amour fou" where an almost
crimes of passion but private berserk love was the
revolutionary catalyst, the surrealism of the
Communist Party surrealists or Breton with Trotsky,
the fascism behind Italian Futurism, the Russian
avant-gardes as agents of an implemented revolutionary
government, etc., are all elided into exercises in
style, with the pits removed.   Without their
ideological-theory components, all those avant-gardes
and their artworks have lost an indispensable
dimension of their significance,

. . . like preserving a national anthem or flags
without knowing which country they belonged to.)

He sees the avant-garde as having existed from 1871 to
May 1968, between the two French revolutions.  (Again,
dated very close to the other "the avant-garde is
dead" proponents, who ground its disappearance, for
example, in the economic absoprtion of the bourgeois
class that gave rise to it by opposition, or even
post-modernity dating its inception a decade or so
later [with the demolition of that Modernist classic
building, etc]) .

The paradox of a dead avant-garde still continuing and
even proliferating: the very repetition ~is~ the death
principle that's driving it post mortem.  There's a
Freudian equation between the death principle and
repetition compulsion, where the sameness or stasis
that repetition compulsion pursues is a zero state of
identity, and that zero is death.

He compares it to de Sade's repetitive, endlessly
generating sentences.  Kind of
like a zombie avant-garde, where the very fact that
it's still going is proof that it's ~really, really~
dead.  If it weren't dead, it would've laid down or
stopped by now.


Of course, this notion of "dead" might be expressed
with another term.  (But which?)

This gratifying theory-death seems quite plausible if
not self-evident to me.  Death has never prevented
literatures from continuing.  Neo-Latin poetry, for
instance, extended well beyond the Middle Ages, even
into the early twentieth century among some Italian
scholastics (the neo-Latin poet whom Saussure
corresponded with, believing he'd found hypogrammes in
his writing) and, for centuries, English poetry and
neo-Latin poetry were produced in parallel, the latter
usually coming first in a poet's career, so that half
of the canon's poetry is sealed off to us (the Latin
poetry of Milton, of Marvell, of Marlowe).  See the
morbidity of New Formalism's dry bones.  Perhaps an
even better example (since neo-Latin poetry was dead
by virtue of its vocabulary being a dead language's
whereas now the dead avant-garde still uses a living
English) might be philosophy, which didn't listen to
its Hegelian death knell, didn't even quite let
Heideggerian twilight bury it, and which, regardless,
as least by Wittgensteinian linguistic skepticism, was
always operating, in metaphysics and ontology, without
any real circulatory system, just sort of a haunted
house of grammatically uprooted ghost words like
"being" or "essence."

This theory-death seems a useful key to me in that it
gives a unique standard of measurement for otherwise
difficult-to-explain Deterioration-like profusions:
the aforementioned Xerox Poetry, for example, is a
sort of Shroud of Turin of the exterminated original.
It allows it to be asked, of the possible means of
sustenance, how much literary ~necrophilia~ is the
driving force.

As in The Prsistent Achaicism, something that deserves
attention.  To seize upon just the convenient example
of the lastest posted new e-journal as a test case,
http://www.wordforword.info : among fourteen writers,
we find ---in no way disparaging the very good, good
poetry there: "medieval streets in context" (history
as the preserved dead) or the dead spot of inheritted
lyrical sentimentality, "the melancholy voices of
these green woods" [William Allegrezza]; haikus
hundred of years after their vitality; the
dead/archaic Elizabethan diction of "And the solution
of contynuyte called ecchymosis in / greke commeth
most often" [Braden]; Martin Corless-Smith, who has
made dead book English his trademark style, and who,
in the particular wordforword poem, reenacts the
manifestation of dead zones by making overstruck
cancelations (deletions) the whole trope of the piece;
the robotic lifelessness of Jukka-Pekka Kervinen's
computer-generated collages; the dead neo-classicism
of "from Philomela to Procne" [McCollough] or "it is
unlawful says Hypnos" [Mulrooney]; pure zero drive
repetition compulsion in David Pavelich's rearranged
lines (see Braden); an elegy of Shakespeare's in the
title "Full Fathom Five" and perhaps the most thorough
Final Days of all the poetry in Jon Thompson's
extremely crepuscular poetry: "The Sense of Ending,"
"ghostly remnants of old fables," etc.  (Again: this
autopsy analysis is in no way a condemnation of the
poetry's commendable strengths: rigidity,
petrifaction, fossilization, vampirism  )

The avant-garde may have been dead so long now that
it's finally beginning to show, in a myriad of ways.
This flat-lining and absent pulse is good news, I
think, because for the first time it allows other
~seeming~ growths to be seen for what they are:
disintegration as dispersal . . .

Cheerfully,


Quotes from ~Masocriticism~:

:

.......................................................

Now this diagnosis suggests, first of all, that the
avant-garde's death was not
 an event that occurred at the end of a long and
healthy life: from the very
 outset everything it produced was its death;
everything it produced delivered
 it into the arms of an economy in which death itself
can be reproduced as a
 commodity.

....

Capital feeds off of the avant-garde; its perpetual
death helps keep the monster
 of capital alive. That is why the death of the
avant-garde must not be confused
 with any termination, any closure, which has not yet
occurred and will never
 occur as long as the culture of capital persists. The
death of the avant-garde is
 not its end but its repetition, indeed its compulsive
repetition.

...

But at the same time, as the death of the avant-garde
makes manifest, in this
 culture one can also die by speaking. One can also
play into the hands of a
 generalized violence against secrecy.

...

It is here that one begins to imagine another
monstrous order in which the
 equation of silence and death is not rejected but
embraced, in which the
 deepest necessity is to seek this silence and death.

 One imagines such a silence so that one's own writing
will become untenable.
 Under the sign of silence and death, writing turns
against itself with enormous
 fury; it becomes a kind of masocriticism, if you
will, subjecting itself to the
 laws of the discursive economy it loathes in order to
inflict upon itself an
 unprecedented suffering that will make writing, as
long as it continues,
 impossible.

..

[de Sade] He would have no interest in the avant-garde
attempt to
 dismantle bourgeois art only to reassemble its
elements once more within the
 discursive economy, within Art and Culture, in the
moribund form of the
 aesthetic commodity. It is because culture is, like
Frankenstein, so adept at
 such reassemblies, at reproducing phantasms of life
from the scattered limbs
 of the dead, that a second death must occur, an
afterlife that is the first
 encounter with death, a death carried out, in Sade's
work, by the continuous
 production of sentences, sentences that are always
punctuated as death
 sentences.

The death of the author? It has long been a critical
clichi. But the lesson of
 Sade is that the only author whose death matters is
the author of the text one
 writes.

Consulting the archive once again, I notice that whatever problems there
may have been with Jeff Jullich's account seem - in the magic words of
network administrators everywhere - to have  "resolved themselves," and
that he was able to post some version of this message yesterday evening. My
bad, as my students used to say. That is, I think they've stopped saying
it. Certain as it is I'm over thirty, if I've learnt the phrase it can bear

Just out from Coach House Books:

The Mood Embosser

144 pp.
1-55245-095-3

Available at http://www.chbooks.com, soon from SPD
(http://www.spdbooks.org), & the 16th book at the recently-mentioned
multi-publisher event in NYC, Thursday, May 9th 2002 at Metro Pictures (519
w. 24th St., NYC, 5:30-7:30 pm).


Here^Òs an unwieldy blurb the publisher edited down, but which I like as is,
bristling against its packaging function, because it implicitly situates the
book among a tendency of writers:

The halogen headlights glaring out of the well-lit tunnel of reflexivity --
where ambitious homologies provided the connective goo of language, agency
and social relations -- belong to Louis Cabri^Òs The Mood Embosser.
Replacing hopeful homologies with a poetics of articulation, the texts Cabri
has compiled over the nineties (the cultural and economic moment when
globalization has subsumed other debates), The Mood Embosser is not a
materialization of a particular local, national or civic cultural formation,
but the emergent beam of a politicized tendency of writers whose work shifts
emphasis from the pedagogical construction of a productive reader to an
accusatory address to both the causes and effects of the very visible thing
called globalism.  At the heartbreaking intersection of the subjective and

I was asked to remind interested parties of the


BOOK LAUNCH PARTY FOR WRITING TO BE SEEN.

Printed Matter
535 West 22nd St.
New York, NY  10011

5-7 PM
Saturday, May 4th, 2002


Anthology Contributors Marilyn Rosenberg, Kathy Ernst, Bill Keith and Scott
Helmes will be present.  The anthology is a Serious 11" by 8.5"
glossy-covered 300+ paged collection of work and artists' statements by 12
leading American visual poets edited by Bob Grumman and Crag Hill.  I wish I
could be there, too, but I live too far away to ride my bike to it, and
wouldn't be able to afford any other kind of transportation.  Note: copies
of
the 500-copy first printing are starting to go, so if you're
interested in visual poetry and what I call textual illumagery, you'd better
get a copy soon--either at Printed Matter or from me.  The book goes for
$24, ppd., from me.  I have twelve copies left of my original 100.

=====================================


------------    CALL FOR PAPERS AND EXHIBITS  ----------


The University of Southern California (USC), The Massachusetts Institute of

Technology (MIT), and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) are
happy to

announce:


The 2ND ANNUAL CONFERENCE AND EXHIBITS ON RACE AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES:
â^À^ÜRACE IN

DIGITAL SPACE 2.0â^À^Ý


2002 Organizers:

Tara McPherson, USC (School of Cinema-TV)

Anna Everett, UCSB (Department of Film Studies)

Henry Jenkins, MIT (Comparative Media Studies)

Christiane Robbins, USC (School of Fine Arts)


CALL FOR PAPERS AND EXHIBITS


The Race in Digital Space 2.0 (RDS 2.0) organizers are convening a follow-up

conference to the successful inaugural conference on the theme of race and new

media technologies held last April on the campus of MIT.  We envision this
year's event

as a vital springboard for ongoing dialogues concerning this crucial aspect
of our

post-industrial transition to the new global information economy.


This year we are pleased to open up the discussion to a broader audience.
Thus, we

welcome your participation in a series of panel discussions, performances,
exhibits, and

poster sessions on the topic of â^À^ÜRace in Digital Space.â^À^Ý  The RDS 2.0
Conference and

Exhibit will be held in Los Angeles on the campus of USC during the weekend
of October

10-13, 2002.


EVENT OVERVIEW


Since the 1996 advent of a graphical interface for the Internet technology
opened

up the World Wide Web (www) to the global masses, traditional communication

systems within and between nation states have been fundamentally transformed.

While much of our experiences with these new media technologies are primarily

characterized in terms of â^À^Ýthe digital divideâ^À^Ý and â^À^Ünational security,â^À^Ý
many scholars,

individuals, grassroots organizations, and free speech activists, among

others, have become increasingly concerned about efforts to limit these new

technologies before their democratizing and liberatory potentials are fully

realized.


This situation has become especially acute in the wake of the 9-11 terrorist

attacks in the U.S.  Last yearâ^À^Ùs conference in April 2001 predated the events
of

9-11.  That timing enabled us to focus on celebrating â^À^Üminorityâ^À^Ý communitiesâ^À^Ù

often-unacknowledged technolust and new media mastery, while simultaneously

addressing the fact of unequal access to new digital technologies.  Our
approach

was in stark contrast to the self-fulfilling prophecies of â^À^Üthe digital
divideâ^À^Ùsâ^À^Ý

often disabling rhetoric.  This year, however, we find ourselves confronted
by a

new set of urgent digital media problematics, such as the White Houseâ^À^Ùs
recent decision

to defund community technology centers, high-tech racial profiling and

cyber-surveillance, decreased corporate philanthropy, living wage issues in
high-tech

employment, and high fees for online connectivity. Consequently, we are
seeking papers

that extend last yearâ^À^Ùs focus, while simultaneously urging us to rethink many
of these

vexing issues in light of the 9-11 tragedy.  Given the accelerated pace of
new media

technologiesâ^À^Ù ability to sway national and global public opinion on any
number of

pressing issues, and in lightening speed, we recognize the need for
interventionist

commentary and responses by committed individuals and groups concerned about
where and

how digital technologies will contribute to our rapidly changing world.  We
therefore

urge you to get involved in this important dialogue by sharing your research,
activism,

artistry and business experiences with us.


Currently, we envision plenary talks that address the following concerns: 1)
The

Digital Divide, Post 9-ll; 2) Tracking Bodies and Global Labor; 3)
Entertaining

Race: Representinâ^À^Ù Race in New Media Environments; 4) Remaking Race:

Authenticating â^À^ÜOtherâ^À^Ý Voices in Digital Spaces; and 5) New Futures: Digital
Theory

Meets Digital Practice.


In addition to these themes and ideas, we are seeking papers, presentations,
projects

and exhibits that address the following; however, we encourage other ideas and

explorations as well.

This message was sent to me today by Kent Johnson, who asked that it be
forwarded to the list. -- dh


Over at Poetics they've been talking in earnest of Language poetry,
what it is, what the avant-garde is, etc. Messages are appearing
five or six a minute, so it seems that Poetics is no longer
moderated. So I wrote Charles Bernstein a very nice note to
suggest that now might be a good time to bury old pettinesses and
to invite back those (me, Henry Gould, Gabe Gudding, Carlo
Pacelli) who had been expelled more than three years ago. I sent
that two days back; no courtesy of response yet.

I'd proposed here the other day that the erstwhile Marxist Language
poets were to the traditional U.S. poetry wing what the Democratic
Party is to the Republican Party. In other words, the Democrats
and Republicans wrangle theatrically over policy, while at bottom
they are as one in their commitment to those literary relations of
production that rest like an elephant on the material shell of the
giant tortoise of ideologically determined cultural property forms
which persist, within the bigger and evolving mode of production
that gave birth to them, to this postmodern day.

It's probably long-winded sentences like that that got me kicked off
in the first place. Maybe when I wrote Charles the other day about
smoking the peace pipe my sentences were too long and so that's
why he hasn't written back. I know that my sentences are too long.
And Gabe Gudding's posts are full of typos. But Henry Gould's
posts are as if written by Henry James, elegant and mellifluous (is
that how you spell mellifluous, Robin? I think so, but it doesn;t
matter). So maybe it's not just that my sentences are too long.
Maybe it's something else... The little Popular Frontist Stalinoids.
Grrrr.

Happy b-day to Ron Silliman (36) and Jose Carlos Mariategui (110)!

Or Monsieur Bernstein gets thousands of emails? Charles Bernstein doesnt
exist per se: he's in Cyberland:he's an entry in an American poetry
anthology:...he's the Tail Wagging the Dog: he's a Language Poet:he's read
lots of philosophy, but he's embarrassed because he never read Henry James.
He read the other James thinking he was the writer...in fact it was this and
similar errors by other would be "traditionalists" which initiated the L=A G
movement: but that aside: in my capacity as the longest sentence writer on
the list I hereby reappoint you back on in the spirit of democracy,
mellifluousness, and general largesse: besides which I'm drunk: I'm a
drunken boat:but welcome on board:we're all in this crazy mess together: as
each of is a Captain Hook for whom alas there waiteth a Crocodile (Yo Ho
Ho!):the only thing is you must all write a language poem for the Listees:
that requirement satisfied, feel thyselves on board.  Richard.

[Attached below are four articles relating to the anti-G8 Labour Ministers'
demo in Montreal last night organized by the Anti-Capitalist Convergence
(CLAC) of Montreal. The first two articles are from Indymedia Montreal, the
third is an eyewitness account distributed by e-mail, and the fourth is from
the mainstream Canadian Press. The CLAC media committee is organizing a
public response to last night's events. More details to follow.]

from Indymedia Montreal
http://montreal.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=3D3666&group=3Dwebcast

Demo against the G8 goes sour quickly as hundreds of demonstrators are
prevented from marching.

Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Place Dominion at Peel and Ren=E9
Levesque 4pm today to march to where G8 ministers were dining. For two
hours, anti-capitalists shared free food, spoke out against the G8, danced
and peacefully converged.

But at 6pm, right when the march was scheduled to leave Place Dominion,
police emerged from the underground parking lot and surrounding alleyways
and quickly surrounded the the 400-odd demonstrators.

Police cordoned the demonstrators into a tight circle at the northwest
corner of the square, on Peel St. between Ste. Catherine and Ren=E9-Levesque=
.
Some managed to slip through restaurants on Peel, aided by fast food workers
who provided safe passage through their restaurant's back door.

The crowd that managed to escape regrouped on Ste. Catherine between Peel
and Metcalfe, in front of large crowds of Friday shoppers.

A lit dumpster was rolled towards the police line, barricades were erected,
the twenty-five cyclists from critical mass showed up, and two kickass
breakdancers were teaching Ste. Catherine pavement a lesson that it would
never forget.

A lonely police van parked in front of HMV soon became the target for
energetic deconstruction. Once its windows were smashed a duffel bag filled
with riot gear was expropriated from the rear seat and distributed to
demonstrators.

=AB Violence is the same facism that we?re fighting against =BB yelled one
demonstrator. But a few hours later an enthusiastic dancer paraded his shiny
white riot helmet, to a roaring appreciative crowd of onlookers.

It seemed that the Friday-night Ste. Catherine set were as pleased by the
demonstrators? show of resistance as they were befuddled by the police
presence and brutality.

But scenes like this are not unfamiliar to Montreal. On March 15th,
International day against police brutality, anti-police brutality
demonstrators were ringed in a similiar cordon and were kept waiting for
hours in the cold rain to be processed. 371 arrests were made.

As Der Kosmonaut predicted after the March 15th action, "Protesters in
future actions should expect more pincer tactics employed by the police."

The 250 or so demonstrators that were horded up tonight were processed one
by one, some of them interrogated, and loaded up on 7 buses and brought to
nearby metro stops. Some were ticketed for illegal assembly ($138 fine),
others were released with no ticket, but others still may have been held and
charged with other offences.

police arrest hundreds
by yves engler 8:25pm Fri Apr 26 '02 (Modified on 10:08pm Fri Apr 26 '02)
yvesengler@hotmail.com

anti-G8 rally is stopped before it starts

Today's anti-G8 rally and supposed to be march was attacked illegally by the
cops. Personally I showed up a couple of minutes after the cops had
encircled people, but I've talked to numerous people who were there.
Basically, people started gathering at the park on Peel and Rene Levesque at
4. Around 5:30 about 200-500 protestors were circled by the cops. I left at
about 9 oclock and around half of all protestors corned had been arrested. I
understand that they were brought in city buses and dropped off at a metro
station and forced on the metro without charges.
Between 5:30 and 9 there was a continuous back and forth between cops and
activists along St Catherine, up Peel and at the park. I witnessed cops beat
and maze numerous people. Mostly those who had the misfortune of falling
when chased by the police.
The police's action caused some response in terms of a damaged police van
and a numer of garbage cans ripped out. All in all it was quite minor
considering an HMV, Roots and Bank of Nova Scotia within metres were all
left completely untouched. Even though the cops had provoked hundreds of
activists.
During the evening thousands upon thousands of montrealers walked by the
line of police officers dressed in riot gear and for the most part seemed
taken aback by the violent nature and posture of 'our'police force.

Eye Witness Testimony to the Montreal G8 arrests, April 26, 2002:

Between 11:30 and 12 noon, I attended a demonstration organized by the
unions in Carr=E9 St-Louis to protest the globalization meetings of the G8=
 in
Montreal. The riot police were present, but did not bother anyone. I arrived
at Dominion Park about 6:10 p.m. to check out the second scheduled
anti-globalization demonstration that began at 4 p.m..

The Montreal riot police had cordoned off a group of about 200 people nearby
in the middle of rue Peel at the rue Cathcart intersection. While tense,
there was little movement or noise in the Dominion Park and arrest area The
cordoned protesters were mostly still, and mostly quiet. A few waved
placards and flags. All reports I received from five witnesses stated that
these anti G8 marchers left Dominion Park on rue Peel peacefully and then
were surrounded within several minutes by riot police. There were no reports
of vandalism or illegal activity from the protesters.

North of the arrest area at the Peel and Ste. Catherine intersection, a
crowd of several hundred developed. People who were part of the anti-G8
march but escaped the riot police cordon stated that most of the people
gathering were passer-by's and not part of the anti-G8 march.

I was at that intersection around 6:30 p.m.. Two or three trash cans had
been emptied in the intersection, and one was smouldering from a fire. The
youth with the trash cans were not anyone of the political activists I
recognized from the anti-G8 activists.

Over the next 45 minutes that I stayed in the general area, a growing number
of passer-by's became interested in the scene, and many seemed to
participate in running away from the riot police when they would clear out
the crowd, and then these same people would return when the police
retreated. Some threw objects at the riot police.

Back at the riot police cordon, the mass arrest of the protesters proceeded
calmly. I did not see any acts of resisting arrests both passively or
actively. I saw approximately 6 - 8 people frisked and lead to a police bus.

Returning to Ste Catherine between Peel and Metcalf, a police mini van was
being vandalized by two or three youths (again no one I recognized from the
activists). An activist I know was cautioning people via a portable sound
system not to panic, to be calm, to beware of the danger and the approaching
riot police, and not to do anything that would add to the danger (like
destroying property). This person was trying to prevent a riot, that the
police actions were seeming to provoke.

It seems that the situation developed as such:

A peaceful anti G8 demonstration left Dominion Park. They were immediately
surrounded by riot police. There was no evidence of any lawbreaking besides
the police depriving people of their constitutional right to protest. Those
that were arrested from the anti G8 demonstration were peaceful throughout.

Outside this police cordon, many people were attracted to the riot police
show of force and the mass arrest of people. People watching became angry at
the mass arrest. This lead to several acts of vandalism outside the police
cordon. None of the people doing the vandalism seem to be political
activists, nor were they targeted by the police for arrest.

The riot police provoked the ensuing vandalism and potential riot by their
abuse of power when they (again for the second time in two months), mass
arrested young protesters who were peacefully taking a political stand
against the government.

The political activists were non-violent; the police were depriving them of
their rights; and passer-by's reacted to this dynamic started engaging in
vandalism and throwing objects at the police.

It seems clear that certain dissent is illegally being suppressed, and that
the police have been given license to violate the Canadian Bill of Rights.
The government is separating the youth protesters from the older union and
NGO protests. They are targeting the youth for abuse and arrest, regardless
of their similar forms of protests and identical issues they are protesting.
They are criminalizing the youth who do not have the resources of the
powerful unions to protect them.

Given the history, I fully expect the police to justify the illegal mass
arrests because of the vandalism that took place by those not targeted for
arrest, and which started 30 minutes after the targeted protesters were
stopped and arrested by the riot police.

Riot police quell Montreal protesters who oppose G-8 labour ministers
meeting

Canadian Press

MONTREAL (CP) - Relative calm returned to downtown streets late Friday
evening after police searched hundreds of anti-globalization protesters for
weapons and incendiary devices. An undisclosed number of people were
arrested and fined $140 for unlawful assembly. Others were released and sent
home.

Riot police armed with clubs and pepper spray moved in at about 6 p.m. to
encircle the demonstrators who gathered in a square near Ste-Catherine
Street. They had been marching peacefully, chanting and holding banners
denouncing a two-day gathering in the city of labour ministers from the
world's eight largest industrialized countries.

Federal Human Resources Minister Jane Stewart was presiding over the
Friday-Saturday meeting.

City police said they responded after receiving information that some of the
protesters were planning to throw Molotov cocktails or rocks.

"It was not simply a blind thing that decided that action," said police
spokesman Andre Durocher.

But supporters decried the police action as an infringement of their rights
to free assembly and expression.

Protest organizers from the Anti-Capitalist Convergence had promised to turn
out to oppose the G-8 meeting. Some of their members greeted visiting
ministers Thursday evening as they met with international union and business
leaders at McGill University and had dinner.

Karina Chagnon, a spokeswoman for the Anti-Capitalist Convergence, said the
meetings were a sham.

"The G-8 is the fuzzy mitten that drives the hidden hand of the market and
the iron fist of the military," she told reporters on Thursday at an outdoor
news conference in driving rain.

"The G-8 is like slavery. There is no way of reforming it. We must fight to
abolish it."

Chagnon said protesters were also preparing to go to Ottawa on June 26-27 to
demonstrate against the G-8 meeting to be held in Kananaskis, Alta., but was
not specific about tactics.

She accused the G-8 of letting companies make maximum profits by eliminating
labour norms and standards, slashing salaries and gutting unions.

make sense of life and thought in a changed age.  One thing is certain=F3it
can no longer be business as usual in academia.  Proposals are invited
which address the kinds of ways we can and should transform our research
and teaching in our now-unsettled age.

Proposals of 500 words engaging the conference theme MUST BE POSTMARKED BY
15 OCTOBER 2002.  Notification of acceptance will be made soon after 15
November.  All presenters must be paid members in good standing of CEA by

Aha, gentle list reader-- you thought the subject line referred to the U.S.
Ironically enough, it refers to Iraq.  Here is an interesting article from
the Observer.

Inside a vile republic

No one should be in any doubt about Saddam's depraved intentions

Henry McDonald
Sunday April 28, 2002
The Observer=20

Children aged between five and 10 are tortured and beaten. Their screams an=
d
cries are recorded on video. The horrific images are then shown to other
men.=20

But this is no sick, paedophile, child-abusing fantasy captured on camera.
According to one man who was forced to watch these vile scenes, the terror
inflicted on these tiny victims was motivated principally for cold-hearted
political reasons. Because whatever revolting pleasure was obtained by the
torturers and the filmcrew alike, the main purpose of this recorded sadism
was to brutalise, terrorise and wear down potential enemies and traitors.

This repulsive testimony of child torture as psychological warfare comes vi=
a
a defector from the sinister Iraqi Mukhabarat or intelligence service and
demonstrates the depravity of a regime objectively defended by Irish and
other Western peaceniks.

The defector's claims appear in the current edition of Vanity Fair, compile=
d
by David Rose. Never before has an article provoked such a feeling of
disgust. For Rose's account of the extent to which Saddam Hussein's
dictatorship will go to terrify its own servants and agents makes the flesh
crawl. More disturbing still is the defector's allegations about the length=
s
the Ba'athist =E9lite have gone in order to acquire weapons of mass
destruction.=20

For example, the former Iraqi agent claims he travelled to Africa to buy
highly toxic 'radioactive material with which to build a dirty radiological
bomb' that kills thousands slowly through radioactive pollution and cancers=
.

He also outlines how Saddam's tyranny trains and finances Hamas, the
Palestinian Islamic fundamentalist movement. According to the defector, it
was Iraq which taught Hamas how to make bombs. Moreover, he says that Iraq
has developed a new missile system to hit Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and
Iran as well, of course, as Israel.

Rose's courageous and thoroughly researched report will make uncomfortable
reading for those on the Western Left most vociferously opposed to any
United States-led attack on Iraq. Because if the defector is telling the
truth (his evidence is supported by Charles Duelfer, the former deputy head
of UNSCOM, the mission aimed at overseeing the destruction of Saddam's
weapons of mass destruction), then there are serious challenges for the Wes=
t
and hard questions for Western peace groups.

For Western governments, especially those EU nations, including Ireland,
which still adopt an ostrich-like approach to Iraq's nuclear ambitions, the
dilemma will not disappear - how to stop Saddam getting the bomb.

Every pacific avenue has been tried since the second Gulf War, from
diplomacy to sanctions, and yet the Baghdad dictatorship, according to
former agents such as the one who spoke to Rose, continues to search for th=
e
technology and raw material needed to build nuclear, biological and chemica=
l
weapons.=20

The defector outlines how the regime evades sanctions through a series of
front companies in the Middle East and Europe to import material into Iraq
that forms the basis of 'dirty bio-bombs' that can kill tens of thousands.
His evidence suggests that even targeted smart sanctions may not prevent th=
e
acquisition of these weapons. The United States and the EU are then left
with only one other option - military intervention.

Some policy-makers express concern that an outright military assault on
Saddam and the Ba'ath will set the entire Middle East ablaze. They argue
that in an atmosphere of seething Arab anger over the Israeli incursions
into Palestinian territory, invading Iraq would push the region over the
edge into widespread, possibly global, conflict.

This thesis, however, entirely misses the point of Saddam's project to buil=
d
a nuclear, chemical and/or bio-bomb. Iraq's acquisition of weapons of mass
destruction is designed precisely to escalate the Arab-Israeli conflict int=
o
a nuclear confrontation. Young Arabs such as the polite Palestinian student
I met last Thursday evening in Queen's University Belfast look forward to
the day of the Arab bomb. And their goal, according to him, regardless of
the rhetoric about two-state solutions from the PLO's apologists in the
West, is the complete destruction of the state of Israel, if necessary
through the use of, or threatened use of, chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons.=20

The trouble with Western peace groups and their leftist support base is tha=
t
they have held a starry-eyed or, in the case of the Irish Left, a
Starry-Plough-eyed view of the Third World, especially those states that
style themselves 'anti-imperialist'. What they surely cannot ignore any
longer is the existence of a regime that endangers the stability not only o=
f
the Middle East but perhaps the planet itself and which will torture and
murder even its own children in order to shore up Saddam's Republic of Fear=

Kasey, list:

Part of my childhood I grew up in a small, rural upstate county a few miles
from a spiritualist community, and I learned this game from the children who
lived  there, who where sons and daughters of spiritualists:

Satan's Coming

A letter must be taken, and the termination "ing". Say, for instance, that P
is chosen. The 1st player says to the second, "Satan's Coming." "How's he
coming?" says the 2nd. "Playing," rejoins the 1st. The 2nd then says to the
3rd, "Satan's Coming." "How?" "Prancing on cloven hooves;" And so the
question and reply go round, through all the words beginning with P and
ending with ing -- piping, pulling, pining, praising, preaching, etc. Those
who cannot answer the question on the spur of the moment "Will be collected
by Satan."

It was a highly charged "game" on many levels, and all these years later,
it's stayed with me.

This sounds like the old parlor game the Minister's Cat

Same kind of round but with a similar first letter game but it goes
around from A to B to C

The ministers cat is an able cat
The ministers cat is a bouncy cat
The ministers cat is a cuddly cat
The ministers cat is a droll cat
The ministers cat is an envious cat
The ministers cat is a fat cat
The ministers cat is a ginger cat
The ministers cat is a horrible cat
The ministers cat is an ingenious cat
The ministers cat is a jolly cat
The ministers cat is a kooky cat


And so on :-)


Best, Geoffrey

A number of people have commented over the past few weeks to the effect
that the Poetics List is no longer moderated. While, given our change of
format, I understand why that might be the general perception, still the
assessment is not quite accurate. For the sake of clarification, I'd like
to draw attention to the first section of the updated Welcome Message; I'll
send a copy of the entire Welcome Message momentarily. Those of you who
have been on the list for some time can see that we haven't returned wholly
to the policy of four years ago, but have hoped instead to achieve some
species of middle ground. For the most part, everyone at this end has been
pleased with the results.

1. About the Poetics List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the increasing
number of subscribers, we are no longer able to maintain the
open format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).
All submissions are reviewed by the moderators in keeping with
the goals of the list, as articulated in this Welcome Message.
The specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively
fluid one: in most cases, messages are reviewed after having
been posted to the list, and difficulties resolved on that basis;
however, the list moderators may shift with impunity between
this and a pre-review mode which calls for all messages to
be read and approved before being forwarded to the list. We
prefer to avoid this option, as it hampers the spontaneity of
discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to these
options, the list moderators may place subscribers who find
themselves unable to abide by the rules of the list under
individual review, in which case only their messages would
be received for moderators' approval before being forwarded
to the list. For further information, please see number 4, the
Cautions section of this Welcome Message. We remain
committed to this editorial function as a defining element of
the Poetics List.

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange
arise Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics List was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its second incarnation,
the list carries over 900 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time.
A good number of other people read the Poetics List via our web
archives at the Electronic Poetry Center (see section 10 below).

Please note that this is a private list and information about
this list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific rather than general interests, and also to keep the
scale of the list relatively small and the volume manageable.
The current limits of the list are 50 messages per day, and
two messages per subscriber per day.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the increasing
number of subscribers, we are no longer able to maintain the
open format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).
All submissions are reviewed by the moderators in keeping with
the goals of the list, as articulated in this Welcome Message.
The specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively
fluid one: in most cases, messages are reviewed after having
been posted to the list, and difficulties resolved on that basis;
however, the list moderators may shift with impunity between
this and a pre-review mode which calls for all messages to
be read and approved before being forwarded to the list. We
prefer to avoid this option, as it hampers the spontaneity of
discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to these
options, the list moderators may place subscribers who find
themselves unable to abide by the rules of the list under
individual review, in which case only their messages would
be received for moderators' approval before being forwarded
to the list. For further information, please see number 4, the
Cautions section of this Welcome Message. We remain
committed to this editorial function as a defining element of
the Poetics List.

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in
poetry that are committed to innovations, renovations, and
investigations of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of
received forms and styles, and to the creation of the otherwise
unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project, and respect our decision to
operate a moderated list. For subscription information or to
contact the moderators, write to <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

For further information on posting to the list, see sections 3 and 4.
below. Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 8.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 8
for details.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your full name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list should provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators
at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include all
of the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>
to resubscribe. If you find that it is not possible to unsub
using your old address, please contact the moderators at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a good number of Poetics messages are
bounced from your account, your subscription to Poetics will be
temporarily suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe
to the list by contacting the moderators at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to one week or more for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by
the moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated
in this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics
and political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also
welcome. Feel free to query the list moderators if you are
uncertain as to whether a message is appropriate. All
correspondence with the moderators regarding submissions to
the list remains confidential and should be directed to us at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on
publications and reading series that they have coordinated, edited,
published, or in which they appear. Such announcements
constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications are always welcome.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly
to the list address:

     <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list
to our administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 4 below.
Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 9.

-------------------

4. Cautions

'Caveat lector': The Poetics List has become increasingly, though
in small proportion, occupied by subscribers who interest themselves
in pseudonymous authorship. The practice, while not encouraged by
the moderators, is tolerated on the grounds that it is no more
practicably eradicable than effectually harmful - not harmful,
that is, until it becomes so on the level of particular, individual
interactions. The feeling, for subscribers unaware of the circumstance,
may be - and perhaps justifiably so - one of having been 'duped.'
That said, we have felt it necessary to caution subscribers to
read carefully and be sure of your acquaintance as it suits your
personal comfort.

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

For reasons of basic security, we actively discourage the
sending of HTML-formatted messages to the list. A quick
glance at the list archive and at list digests (see sections 5
and 9) will show that HTML-formatted messages are not
interpreted by the listserv program as it is currently
configured, which makes their reading inconvenient at
best. All messages intended for the Poetics List should
be sent in ASCII or Text-Only format.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post, since this may make it
difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.
Messages containing attachments will be presumed to be
worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission
of the author! Posting on the list is a form of publication.
Copyright for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author;
material from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without
the author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair
use" of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages
per day from any one subscriber; in general, we expect subscribers
to keep their post to less than 10-15 posts per month. Our goal is
a manageable list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers)
of 50 or fewer messages per day.

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees or the list owners, also messages designed to
"waste bandwidth" or cause the list to reach its daily limit.
These messages are considered offensive and detrimental to
list discussion. Offending subscribers will be placed on
temporary review (see section 1). Repeat offenders will be
removed from the list immediately. Please do not put this
policy to test!

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the moderators at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

5. Subscription Options

It is possible to receive the Poetics List as separate posts
or as daily digests. When you subscribe, the default setting is
"regular," meaning you will receive a separate email for each
message distributed to the list.

Regular:
The default option, this is the form in which you will receive
the list if you choose no other. With a "regular" subscription,
you receive individual postings immediately, as they are OK'd
by the list moderator. To revert to this option if you are
currently receiving the list in digest form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain the following text:

     set poetics nodigest

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

Digest:
With a "digest" subscription, you receive larger messages (called
"digests") at regular intervals, usually once per day. These "digests"
are collections of individual list postings. Some lists are so active
that they produce several digests daily; the Poetics List produces
only one, mailed just after midnight EST.

Digests are a good compromise between reading everything as it is
posted and feeling like the list is clogging your mailbox with a
multitude of individual postings.

To receive the Poetics List in digest form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain the following text:

     set poetics digest

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

Index:
With an "index" subscription, you receive a short "index" message
once per day. These "indexes" show you what is being discussed on
the list without including the text of the individual postings. For
each posting, the date, the author's name and address, the subject
of the message and the number of lines it comprises is listed. You
can then follow instructions provided in the index to download
messages of interest from the server.

An index subscription is ideal if you have a slow connection and
only read a few hand-picked messages. The indexes are very short
and you do not have to worry about long download times. The drawback
of course is that you need to maintain your internet connection or
reconnect to order messages of interest from the server.

You can choose to have the index sent to you in either a traditional
format (plain text) or in HTML format with hyperlinks. Using the HTML
index, you may click on a link provided with each message to open your
web browser to that message in the Poetics List archive.

To receive the Poetics List in index form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain, for the text-only
index:

     set poetics nohtml index

And for the hyper-link index:

     set poetics html index

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

6. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Please do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

     set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 9 below.)

-------------------

7. "Review Subscribership" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review subscribers"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information. Address queries are, of course, welcome
to be posted to the list.

-------------------

8. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

The World Wide Web-based Electronic Poetry Center is located at
<http://epc.buffalo.edu>.

The EPC's mission is to serve as a gateway to the extraordinary
range of activity in formally innovative writing and digital media
poetry in the United States and around the world. The Center provides
access to extensive resources in new poetries. These include our
E-POETRY library, our links to digital VIDEO and SOUND (including
our award-winning LINEbreak series of radio interviews and performances)
as well as e-journals such as lume, Deluxe Rubber Chicken, Alyricmailer,
and many others, the POETICS List archives, an AUTHOR library of
electronic poetry texts and bibliographies, and direct connections
to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides
information about contemporary electronic poetry magazines and print
little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics.
Visit the EPC's many libraries, the featured resources available on
the EPC home page, or its NEW listings, where recent additions are
available for quick access.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

-------------------

9. Poetics Archives at the EPC

Go to the Electronic Poetry Center <http://epc.buffalo.edu>
and select the "Poetics" link from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. Or set your browser to go directly to
<http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html>.

You may browse the Poetics List archives by month and year or
search them for specific information. Your interface will allow
you to print or download any of these files.

Please note that it is possible to toggle between proportional
and non-proportional fonts in viewing archived messages; a
feature that may be useful to interpret messages reliant on
the neat spacing of a proportional font, or that require the
"word wrap" feature of same - and useful, too, for aesthetic
reasons. To change the display font of an archived message,
simply follow the "proportional font" or "non-proportional font"
link at the top of the message.

I was disconnected from the email server just as my first clarification
went out, and I'd assumed it lost; here's the expanded version that I was
typing when the first version showed up in the list archive. Please
disregard the latter in preference of this one. ca

Over the past few weeks, I've noticed a number of comments to the effect
that the list is no longer moderated. While - given the change of format -
I can understand why that might be the general impression, still it's not
quite an accurate one. For the sake of clarification, then, I'd like to
draw attention to the first section of the updated Welcome Message; I'll
post the entire Welcome Message momentarily. Long time subscribers can see
that we haven't quite reverted to the policy of four years ago, preferring
instead a course that we hope will allow us to maintain a space that is
largely free of the vituperative restraints that prompted our initial
change to a moderated format.

So far, everyone at this end has been more or less pleased with the
results. I would, however, at the same stroke like to remind everyone that:

1. For the purposes of keeping the list manageable for everyone, we have
established an automated limit of 50 messages per day and 2 messages per
subscriber per day. Please keep in mind that messages whose entire content
is "I agree" or "I disagree," while well-intended in a conversational mode,
do carry us toward the 50 message limit. (There is some flexibility here,
as I realize that boring administrative stuff is taking us 3 steps closer
to the limit even now.)

2. Our longstanding policy against "flaming" remains in effect. While it is
generally a matter of common sense that one not verbally abuse others, for
those who need more specific information I have here included the relevant
paragraph from section 4 of the Welcome Message.

1. About the Poetics List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the increasing
number of subscribers, we are no longer able to maintain the
open format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).
All submissions are reviewed by the moderators in keeping with
the goals of the list, as articulated in this Welcome Message.
The specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively
fluid one: in most cases, messages are reviewed after having
been posted to the list, and difficulties resolved on that basis;
however, the list moderators may shift with impunity between
this and a pre-review mode which calls for all messages to
be read and approved before being forwarded to the list. We
prefer to avoid this option, as it hampers the spontaneity of
discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to these
options, the list moderators may place subscribers who find
themselves unable to abide by the rules of the list under
individual review, in which case only their messages would
be received for moderators' approval before being forwarded
to the list. For further information, please see number 4, the
Cautions section of this Welcome Message. We remain
committed to this editorial function as a defining element of
the Poetics List.

Yes, very similar, and now I feel it most probably was a kicked-up version
of the same, only back then in those environs, with those actors, to a
seven-year old, it was an act that pulled me out of all sense of present
into a dark space.

>Spring has arrived in New York. Here at Granary we know this not
>because after a long hard winter of 60-degree days, we are now
>enjoying 60-degree days, but because the New Spring Titles are about
>to arrive. Two very different, but perhaps strangely related, books
>are coming out this May from Granary-A Girl's Life by Johanna
>Drucker and Susan Bee, and A Conversation with David Antin by David
>Antin and Charles Bernstein. I say strangely related because during
>a recent visit with David Antin, he suggested that perhaps we change
>the title of his book to A Boy's Life. Alas, covers had already been
>printed. So a bit about the new titles=8A
>
>A Conversation with David Antin is a four-month interchange between
>the poet/essayist Charles Bernstein and artist/poet/critic David
>Antin. Ideas on art, poetry, as well as Antin's transition to
>site-specific talk performances are discussed. The combination of
>the speed of electronic transmission and the rigors of writing as
>opposed to talking make this book, in Antin's words, "a cross
>between an 18th-and 21st-century text."
>
>from A Conversation with David Antin:
>
>Charles: I often get the sense of poetry being disappointing to you,
>that the failure of poetry to do something it could be doing better
>was a kind of inspiration for writing poetry=8AWhat do you think
>poetry should be doing?=8A
>
>David: I hardly remember how I started to write poetry=8A But I had a
>memory of driving one summer with my Uncle Julius, my father's twin
>brother, up toward his family's bungalow on Sackett Lake; and as we
>were cruising through the green summer landscape, he suddenly burst
>into this poem by Pushkin, producing a cascade of cadenced Russian I
>barely understood that brought tears to his eyes. For just a moment.
>Then he corrected himself, laughed and said, "What nonsense!" Maybe
>I remembered this. Maybe I heard of it somewhere else, but I thought
>somewhere there must be something called modern poetry, that meant
>something to us living now at the end of the Second World War. So I
>started to look.
>
>A Conversation with David Antin (for only $12.95!) presents the
>entirety of this dialogue (parts of this text were previously
>published in The Review of Contemporary Fiction) between two of the
>most important figures on the contemporary poetry scene. The text is
>complimented by Album Notes, a collection of photographs from
>Antin's life with extended annotations -"shaggy dog stories"- verbal
>elaborations of the pictures which, together, add further dimension
>to the work of this extraordinary writer and thinker.
>
>A collaborative graphic melodrama of romance, crime and passion, A
>Girl's Life addresses adolescent angst in all of its fashionably
>gory details. The snares and pitfalls of contemporary life, with
>which all girls must struggle to survive, are here revealed through
>darkly comic and fiendishly noir prose, accompanied by lurid collage
>and wildly adventurous typography. The publication of A Girl's Life
>as a trade edition makes this beautiful, full-color artists' book
>available at the amazing price of just $24.95! Here is a little
>preview of the book. Now imagine high-color, high-contrast,
>high-and-low art, sticker-splattered collages by Susan Bee
>accompanying Johanna Drucker's text as you read:
>
>An aura came up around her frizzy curls. Ethnicity and enlightenment.
>A vision
>of smashed sugarplums
>danced through her head.
>A swaggering energy field arose from her delicate flesh.
>Becki, her best friend for life,
>was in mega trouble.
>Ivan's voice came
>at her through the lime-
>green plastic receiver.
>He was a low-life creep
>with a touch of evil.
>Dawn vanished down the rabbit hole,
>Becki had been bit bad by the Ivan bug.
>Dawn just knew she could totally save her.
>
>Rosmarie Waldrop writes, "What happens when two brilliant
>avant-garde artists collaborate? A wild carnival of collage, color,
>design and lines like 'Decorum had its way with her.' Or: 'Her
>outfit ached against my thigh.' Any sentimental image of a girl's
>life we might have is overexposed, self-titillated and
>deconstructed. It's dazzling. It's funny. It's a riot."
>
>Also due this spring: Mondrian's flowers, a new limited-edition book
>by Alan Loney and Max Gimblett. This elegant book which takes
>inspiration from Piet Mondrian's early, somewhat figurative work
>unfolds around Gimblett's blazing kaleidoscopic watercolor spreads.
>Loney's text is a lyrical and lucid counter meditation to the
>detonating images. This book is paradoxically restrained and untamed
>- energized, almost electric but, at the same time, governed by
>refined language, careful reflection and a balanced, Zen-like
>composition, printed letterpress by Inge Bruggeman at Textura
>Letterpress in Portland, OR. The images were printed by Ruth Lingen
>and the bindings made by Judith Ivry, both in New York City. We
>expect to see the first finished copies by the end of spring, 2002.
>
>Born in Auckland, New Zealand, visual artist Max Gimblett has
>exhibited extensively since the early seventies in America,
>Australia, Sweden, Japan, Switzerland and Denmark. Gimblett
>currently divides his time between New Zealand and New York.
>His most recent one-person shows include exhibitions at Queensland
>Art Gallery, Brisbane and Ethan Cohen Fine Arts, New York.
>
>Alan Loney is the author of eight books of poetry; his dear
>Mondrian, won the New Zealand Book Awards prize in 1977. For several
>years he edited the magazine A Brief Description of the Whole World;
>as printer and publisher he has operated Hawk Press, Black Light
>Press and The Holloway Press. The Writers Group brought out Reading |
>Saying | Making: Selected Essays in 2001. Presently Loney lives in
>Australia. Robert Creeley writes "Alan Loney's work has always been
>at the cutting edge of New Zealand's place in world literature."
>
>Upcoming Events
>
>Granary has been nominated in three categories for The 2002
>Firecracker Alternative Book Awards including the Outstanding
>Independent Press Of The Year! Now, we don't want to be accused of
>attempting to sway the results, but we do encourage you all to get
>out the vote! Go to http://www.firecrackerbooks.org/finoflash.html
>and cast your ballot, not for anyone in particular, just don't tell
>us if you, let's say, end up choosing McSweeney's as outstanding
>press of the year. I mean, come on, that guy has a movie deal!
>Speaking of the Firecracker Awards, they are but a part of this
>year's Book Expo America (NYC) which will be held at the Jacob
>Javits Convention Center on May 3rd, 4th and 5th and Granary will be
>in attendance. Stop by our table (we'll be in the D.A.P./Distributed
>Art Publishers compound at booth number 4325) if you happen to find
>yourself in the neighborhood and get your brand-spanking-new Granary
>Books button. In spring's new been-there-done-that colors (black and
>white) it is the perfect addition to any ensemble. We have produced
>a catalog of all of our trade publications (new,  forthcoming &

>On April 24th there will a special benefit at The Poetry Project at
>St. Mark's Church celebrating Granary's re-publication of The
>Vermont Notebook by John Ashbery and Joe Brainard. The event will

>Berrigan, and Elaine Equi accompanied by slide projections of Joe
>Brainard's drawings. First published in 1975, The Vermont Notebook

>
>The Poetry Project will be offering a signed, limited-edition

>News
>
>Granary would like to thank Lewis Warsh and Anne Waldman for
>organizing and emceeing Angel Hair Anthology readings in the Bay
>Area on March 7th and 8th. Both events were terrific evenings by all
>accounts, providing an opportunity for contributors to get together
>and share work with each other and a new generation of Angel Hair
>fans. Special thanks to Micah Ballard and Owen Hill for hosting the
>events at, respectively, the New College of California and Moe's
>Books. Both venues were gracious hosts and, in addition, Micah was
>generous enough to organize a lovely reception at the reading on the
>7th. Thanks to all the readers!
>
>In February Granary Books participated in the annual College Art
>Association's four-day annual conference which included panel
>discussions, talks and workshops. Steve Clay spoke as part of the
>panel "Artists as Writers/Writers as Artists" along with Susan
>Viguers, Warren Lehrer, Kathy Walkup, Karen Schiff and chair
>Patricia Smith. The panel was well attended (in spite of the 9:00 am
>start time on Saturday morning!). All of the presentations were
>terrific. Steve's talk focused on the uniqueness of the book as the
>form for specific content. His point was well-illustrated when
>technical glitches delayed those participants who had slides to show
>and Steve stepped up to the plate with the actual artifacts - books
>by bill bissett, Johanna Drucker, and several others. As he began
>his talk and went to open bill's Lunaria, Steve paused and said,
>"Let me just fire this baby up. Yes, I think it is going to work,"
>and he pretty much had the crowd right then and there. The slide
>projector was ultimately operational and the work that the other
>participants brought was wonderful to see and illustrated the talks
>gracefully.
>
>Granary also took part in the Symposium "make-up on empty space: a
>celebration of Anne Waldman" at the University of Michigan, Ann
>Arbor, March 13th-15th. Steve participated in a panel "Publishing
>and the Small Press Scene" with Allan Kornblum, Ken Mikolowski and
>moderator Bill Morgan. Other participants in the three-day
>conference included: Anne Waldman, Andrei Codrescu, Laura Bardwell,
>Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, David Cope, Maria Damon, Rachel Blau
>Duplessis, Alan Gilbert, Anselm Hollo, Joanne Kyger, Akilah Oliver,
>Jena Osman, Ron Padgett, Kristin Prevallet, Eleni Sikelianos,
>Heather Thomas, Lorenzo Thomas and Diane Wakoski. By all accounts it
>was an amazing series of events, emphasizing the tremendous range of
>activities for which Anne has been a driving force over the past 35
>years. Anne's commitment to developing, nurturing and establishing
>community was more evident than ever. Maria Damon's talk, which
>expanded Anne's idea of "making the world safe for poetry" into
>"making the world safe through poetry" summed up Waldman's
>remarkable endeavors perfectly. As Jane Magazine wrote in a recent
>review of The Angel Hair Anthology (edited by Waldman and Lewis
>Warsh, Granary Books 2001), "Any book in which one of the editors
>(Anne) reminisces about an inspirational acid trip gets my
>attention. And it gets better. This anthology of Angel Hair =8A
>includes the funny/surreal/raunchy writings of Jim Carroll, Robert
>Creeley and Barbara Guest. Anne, by the way, started the Jack
>Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University in
>Boulder, CO, with Allen Ginsberg in the '70s. I want to be like her
>when I grow up."
>
>************
>
>Finally, I will close-out this first issue of our newsletter with a
>quote from a review of MoMA's "The Russian Avant-Garde Book,
>1910-1934" by Holland Cotter (forwarded to Granary by Charles
>Bernstein):
>
>       "More traditional collaboration between artists and poets
>has, of course, a long rich Modernist history, which is still very
>much alive, though it receives scant attention. Theoretically, a
>show like, "The Russian Avant Garde Book" is the perfect opportunity
>to position this continuing and changing relationship center stage,
>to bring contemporary poets and word-artists of all kinds into the
>art museum, though the Modern has made no such plans.
>
>       Maybe the museum-and this seems to be true of most mainstream
>institutions-sees poetry as lying outside its purview, or simply
>beside the point of art. But poetry is built into the Modern's
>history. Frank O'Hara was a curator there. Chances are he used to
>walk through the second-floor galleries where the Russian books are
>now installed, writing poems in his head. So maybe the 'new,'
>expanded Modern, which has already demonstrated a healthy interest
>in the work of young artists, will do something to sustain this

Aaron. And you buy into all that propaganda ?  The US has already got
weapons of mass destruction, and people thoughout the world are and have
died from the testing of American (and British and other) nuclear weapons:
and thousand, hundreds of thousands have died as a result of US-backed
so-called counter-terrorism. I saw an ex CIA chief boasting about this on
the BBC Or maybe that was propaganda...well in a sense it was as this means
the agent/boss can hide other "evils"...He said it was neccessary to
eliminate communism in South America. There is as much propaganda though
coming from so-called neutral British sources who are in the pay of the
right wing as there s from Saddam Hussein who seems to me to be a good guy.
   The US is right now threatening to use preemtive nuclear strikes: that
makes the US very close to the Nazis. Certainly the US funds the Israeli
Nazi State to the tune of about  US$5 billion a year.
   Hitler, to gain sympathy, or energise those in doubt, used to create
propaganda films showing Jews as rats: he also dressed up Poles in German
uniform, shot them, and claimed that Germany had been attacked: well
technology has gone ahead and nowdays they can create a Bin Laden and dub in
what is required, manufacture films of children, blow up a couple of
buildings in NY for practice: you can be assured that the anti-moslems and
anti-communists are all well paid: some in fat positions in your American,
and in British, and other Universities.
   Beware of the bullshit factor. I dont feel threatenned by any Arab
countries or Arab people or Palestinians or other: but I'm sure as hell
scared for the world by the United States: the most corrupt, evil,
terroristic, fascist nation on the earth. Richard.

Aha, gentle list reader-- you thought the subject line referred to the U.S.
Ironically enough, it refers to Iraq.  Here is an interesting article from

Inside a vile republic

No one should be in any doubt about Saddam's depraved intentions

Henry McDonald
Sunday April 28, 2002
The Observer

Children aged between five and 10 are tortured and beaten. Their screams and
cries are recorded on video. The horrific images are then shown to other
men.

But this is no sick, paedophile, child-abusing fantasy captured on camera.
According to one man who was forced to watch these vile scenes, the terror
inflicted on these tiny victims was motivated principally for cold-hearted
political reasons. Because whatever revolting pleasure was obtained by the
torturers and the filmcrew alike, the main purpose of this recorded sadism
was to brutalise, terrorise and wear down potential enemies and traitors.

This repulsive testimony of child torture as psychological warfare comes via
a defector from the sinister Iraqi Mukhabarat or intelligence service and
demonstrates the depravity of a regime objectively defended by Irish and
other Western peaceniks.

The defector's claims appear in the current edition of Vanity Fair, compiled
by David Rose. Never before has an article provoked such a feeling of
disgust. For Rose's account of the extent to which Saddam Hussein's
dictatorship will go to terrify its own servants and agents makes the flesh
crawl. More disturbing still is the defector's allegations about the lengths
the Ba'athist élite have gone in order to acquire weapons of mass
destruction.

For example, the former Iraqi agent claims he travelled to Africa to buy
highly toxic 'radioactive material with which to build a dirty radiological
bomb' that kills thousands slowly through radioactive pollution and cancers.

He also outlines how Saddam's tyranny trains and finances Hamas, the
Palestinian Islamic fundamentalist movement. According to the defector, it
was Iraq which taught Hamas how to make bombs. Moreover, he says that Iraq
has developed a new missile system to hit Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and
Iran as well, of course, as Israel.

Rose's courageous and thoroughly researched report will make uncomfortable
reading for those on the Western Left most vociferously opposed to any
United States-led attack on Iraq. Because if the defector is telling the
truth (his evidence is supported by Charles Duelfer, the former deputy head
of UNSCOM, the mission aimed at overseeing the destruction of Saddam's
weapons of mass destruction), then there are serious challenges for the West
and hard questions for Western peace groups.

For Western governments, especially those EU nations, including Ireland,
which still adopt an ostrich-like approach to Iraq's nuclear ambitions, the
dilemma will not disappear - how to stop Saddam getting the bomb.

Every pacific avenue has been tried since the second Gulf War, from
diplomacy to sanctions, and yet the Baghdad dictatorship, according to
former agents such as the one who spoke to Rose, continues to search for the
technology and raw material needed to build nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons.

The defector outlines how the regime evades sanctions through a series of
front companies in the Middle East and Europe to import material into Iraq
that forms the basis of 'dirty bio-bombs' that can kill tens of thousands.
His evidence suggests that even targeted smart sanctions may not prevent the
acquisition of these weapons. The United States and the EU are then left
with only one other option - military intervention.

Some policy-makers express concern that an outright military assault on
Saddam and the Ba'ath will set the entire Middle East ablaze. They argue
that in an atmosphere of seething Arab anger over the Israeli incursions
into Palestinian territory, invading Iraq would push the region over the
edge into widespread, possibly global, conflict.

This thesis, however, entirely misses the point of Saddam's project to build
a nuclear, chemical and/or bio-bomb. Iraq's acquisition of weapons of mass
destruction is designed precisely to escalate the Arab-Israeli conflict into
a nuclear confrontation. Young Arabs such as the polite Palestinian student
I met last Thursday evening in Queen's University Belfast look forward to
the day of the Arab bomb. And their goal, according to him, regardless of
the rhetoric about two-state solutions from the PLO's apologists in the
West, is the complete destruction of the state of Israel, if necessary
through the use of, or threatened use of, chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons.

The trouble with Western peace groups and their leftist support base is that
they have held a starry-eyed or, in the case of the Irish Left, a
Starry-Plough-eyed view of the Third World, especially those states that
style themselves 'anti-imperialist'. What they surely cannot ignore any
longer is the existence of a regime that endangers the stability not only of
the Middle East but perhaps the planet itself and which will torture and
murder even its own children in order to shore up Saddam's Republic of Fear.

Of course I'll have to disagree with Jeffrey's diagnosis, at least in the
particular context of Word/For Word. I wouldn't (and won't) use the term
avant-garde to describe its content, partly to avoid the obvious nest of
vipers such a tricky term would create for a journal, and partly because
it wouldn't at all be an accurate or subtle term in that it would elide
too many overtly differing concerns, practices, and processes at work in
the first issue. Poets write for their peers, for their self, out of an
impulse, or intellect, or whatever. If it's received as such then it's a
measure of living. I'm recalling the last bit of John Cage's "The Future
of Music" in which, as he's surely considering not only the future of
"experimental" (another tricky term) music but its supposed demise, he
says "People frequently ask me what my definition of music is. This is it.
It is work. That is my conclusion."  Plenty of folks are busily, and
happily, at work, perhaps too much so to worry about its death. I'm
wondering,  however, if Jeffrey might be implying the death of poetry, and
not only that of the avant-garde?

Well, Richard-- I didn't know what to make of the article I posted. I hadn't
read any specific stories of Iraq except in the Atlantic (was it? or New
Yorker?) a tale of Saddam Hussein's lechery told by a woman who was coerced
to have sex with him.  I hope my posting of it didn't imply agreement with a
U.S. nuclear strike (hadn't heard that one).

That said, I don't really agree with the above description of the U.S.

Here's to healthier skepticism,
-Aaron

Well, I remember participating in a lot of debates
like this one during the 80s trying (failing) to
explain to my American friends why it was a Bad
Mistake for the Americans and their CIA to be helping
Saddam (money and weapons) wage war against the Iraani
people--one of the things I tried to explain to them
(why don't Americans ever get any real news in the
media?) was that Saddam Hussain was using the American
money not just to wage war on Khomeini (did you ever
think you'd miss Khomeini?) but to wage war against
his own people, including the ethnic and religious
minorities.

none that logic was good enough for my friends nor for
murderous, Machivellian American presidents of that
decade.

later it was the same warnings from the Shi'a muslim
community (we're smart, we Shi'as) about funding the
reactionary Mujahedeen/Taliban--who incidently, also
with CIA money, helped to train that other troublesome
group in the Philipines...

I mean, Americans just EXCEL at creating bad
situations that come back and bite them in the ass...

a time to sow, a time to reap--

the fact that Saddam, bin Laden, the Shah of Iran,
Noriega, etc., etc., are butchers and brutes was never
new to anyone who had to live under their rule...it
was American convenience that required their ascension
to power, American convenience that required
(requires?) their fall.

that's the vile part.

Whether or not Saddam is the butcher the US and its allies portray him as, I=
=20
don't know.  I do know that US propaganda campaigns routinely demonize world=
=20
leaders they are about to assassinate or depose -- witness, for example, the=
=20
slanted reporting by US media sources on Chavez in Venezuela.  But what I do=
=20
know is that the continuing 'sanctions' being enforced on Iraq by the US and=
=20
its allies has cost, and are continuing to cost the lives of hundreds of=20
thousands of Iraqi children.  This fact is not in dispute.  Consider, for=20
example, the following exchange:

In an interview with Leslie Stahl of CBS on May 11, 1996, U.S. Secretary of=20
State Madeline Albright was asked whether the over half a million children=20
killed by the sanctions were "worth it." Her response was: "It=E2=80=99s a h=
ard=20
choice, but I think, we, think, it=E2=80=99s worth it."

The question is, worth it for whom?  And now the US and it allies have=20
racheted up the hate propaganda as an apparent prelude for a military assaul=
t=20
on Iraq.  By accusing Saddam of unspeakable acts, the US and it allies are=20
prepared to unleash their own unspeakable acts on the Iraqis.  The irony of=20
this is not lost on everyone, especially those who realize that the US and i=
t=20
allies don't give a rat's ass about unspeakable acts, as their support for=20
various perpetrators of unspeakable acts around the world attests to.  What=20
the US and its allies are interested in, are political and --most importantl=
y=20
-- economic hegemony, especially the economic hegemony of oil.  While the=20
continental US contains only 3% of the world's known oil reserves, the Globa=
l=20
US has a much greater share, and evidently wants much more.  It's important=20
to understand that there is no loss of life that is too great in adding to=20
that share.  What's a few million more dead Iraqi children compared to the=20
riches that accrue from the control of the production and pricing of the oil=
=20
reserves in the Middle East?  What is a democratic government in Venezuela,=20
et al., compared to control of their oil reserves?  Perhaps one should=20

Christopher, thanks for the clarification.--I for one was surprised to learn
that we are restricted to just two postings per day: I could have sworn,
loudly, there had been nine or ten messages from a single subscriber on some
days.  Can there be an explanation for this apparent contradiction?
Meanwhile, keep up the good work!  Best, David

Is the List's new policy of relaxed moderation and the recent emergence on
the list of cretins like this a mere coincidence? In the context of the
List's well-documented history of censorship it seems that a conscious
exception is being made to encourage a particular propaganda that is
endorsed by the list owners/moderators.

Dear Leonard,

If you disagree with what this person posted, I can totally respect it--
*if* you make some sort of counter-argument.  If you call him a name because
of his opinions I have to assume that you have no respect for him or for
anybody else on this list.  As for list moderation, the only favoritism I
see is toward you: your post is a blatant example of "flaming," and
according the list's policy it should not have been allowed through.

To me, "flaming" is the cowardly personal attack you're making, not the
question I'm raising about list moderation, which has been un-even.

Dear Leonard Brink,
I don't see anyone's difference of opinion here as
cretinous.

If you are accusing me and Joe of being cretins: fair enough. I dont care
what you think of me as I dont know who you are.. ..but  I do know that I
tend to rave on and over react...but in this case I think I had some
justification...maybe some or even all of what Aaron conveyed is true: maybe
I'm blinded: but the cause of that "blindness" is in fact the hypocrisy that
has accompanied US policy: of course I'm not attacking the people of America
or even Israel: you may be surprised but it is because I do care about the
needless killing on both sides (but I see suicide bombing as a kind of
desparate reaction - a heroic act of rebellion: while intelligent
negotiation is the long term solution...and while that isnt happenning): or
even if it is a clear cut case of self-defence one shows one's concern by
active and often strong debate or action. Aaron has his opinions and I
respect them...I''m not saying he's stupid (or his report is or was): I am
simply pushing my views which are (without apology) laden often with
rhetoric but that rhetoric is my right (poetic and otherwise).
  This list can't moderate against argued opinion: eg if you had come back
with: "But I have information which contradicts your stance and backs up
Aaron's report." That would contribute. But to attack people personally
invites  the censorship that you advocate: however I'm opposed to censorship
(I mean in general and - mostly -on this list). Some people mistake a strong
(and sometimes even flawed) argument - or ANY show of emotion or concern -
as being "wrong" or "mad" because it "flames" or is fiery ... but the
"anger" or the fieriness is a result of a truth of feeling about a
situation: ok the details can be twisted and manipulated endlessly (and one
can even be wrong in "points of law or fact"): but we need to be aware of
WHY this kind of anti-Iraqi propaganda is emerging right now (why it
provokes emotive response against it and how it is often put up as the (or
a) rationale eg for a US attack on another country (which this time: Libya o
r Iraq or Iran or Korea or even China?) (which if eg Iraq were to attack
Kuwait it gets hammered and everyone cheers and goes on about how terrible
Hussein is when he's probably been egged on by the US in the first place)):
and who controls, ultimately, the news media. Does oil oil the way: I'd say
oil is one culprit, and greed, but there are other factors: the need to
control the drug trade, strategic positioning of the US military, power: the
sexual - yes sexual - desire and even hunger for sheer naked power, the
deep located sexual desire creating a consequent "need" to kill, the deep
desire for certain militarists to inflict pain and death, the love of war
and adventure, the  need for armament business people to maintain their cash
flow, the Western person's deep desire for cheap gas or petrol, racialism,
the need to create an enemy (Joe McCarthyism), the kudos those "at the top"
get, party politics, and the Richard Thirdian love of machination.
  The good side: today I saw some protesters, on TV  (Ok I know dont believe
everything on TV!) including some Americans, who, with great courage, had
got into the temple in Jerusalem: people can discriminate...they'll know
when it IS right ot act against Iraq (if ever)..and when to protest: its
getting clearer that the whole US-Militarist (here I differentiate from the
American people) plot is going badly wrong: as Mao said, they are lifting a
rock on drop it on their own heads - if its not stalemate or checkmate its
at least zugzwang: it doesnt look good for the XR-Republicans or Sharon the
Bad.
   So the US etal have chosen the wrong time to attempt to undermine
Iraq...one of the oldest and richest civilisations was located there:
writing was invented in Iraq.  We would be cretins to ignore international
events and just write and debate langauge poetry... that debate is always
linked to politics. To debate it constantly maybe silly, but these issues
have to addressed at the right times. Richard.

As FDR said of Somoza, who he'd just installed in the Nicaraguan
presidency, "He's a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch."

The US ius geared to the quarterly report. Longer than three months is
science fiction.

My sense is that, SPLURT! in general terms, "we" don't often-enough think of
this Listserv as a "time-based project," in which we are participants by
(conscious) default. This is not only what the Listserv could ideally be (a
collective poetry project). This is what it is, regardless of how sorry a
state we let it, and us, fall into. A time-based project is what this is,
even when the "project" sense is denied and/or ignored, and when the "time"
sense is made so glaringly present that we no longer recognize the present
as a tense. Any project needs to be constructed. Any construction obtains
because of principles and rules. Of all possible models of Internet
"projects," a listserv is the most freewheeling and amorphous, certainly;
but, nevertheless, even this one retains a singular shape -- partly
discursive (who posts what, etc), partly determinative (e.g. two-post limit
per day now), partly technological, etc. To ignore these (and other similar)
aspects, is to ignore the most salient features of the Listserv as a medium
of expression. Revved reflexive attention to the Listserv's time-based
project-like features would at least start to address the materiality of the
Listserv as a collective medium. This metacommentary of mine does not come
anywhere near to doing that, however; no metacommentary, in itself, would.

"Medium" here only partially -- in fact, minimally (but importantly) --
refers to the Internet technology, as I've implied above (even though most
critical attention is directed to the sorcerer-like powers of the machinery,
extrapolating from it to idealities of communication, as if technology in
itself amounts to difference, and McLuhan had never written a word to learn
from -- yet we all at the same time know that such determinism is not the
case; just think of the early practitioners of Concrete, scribbled on paper
with pencil, in unventilated rooms with dangling light bulbs, for instance,
or of Klebnikov drifting hatless through the snows of Mongolia). "Medium"
here more fundamentally and crucially refers to this very collectivity of
address, this one, mine, as well as every other singularity of address that
is enacted here, however generically, and this particular listening ear,
mine, in its singular but also in its collective form, and each of yours in
turn, and including this Emersonian eyeball enacted in present-tense
placeless space, and yours, in this go-go of e-gos (har har). From writing,
now, with / to, like this, a sense of medium is created and sustained, can
even be reflexively shaped -- but most of the time, it seems we're just
punching clock, without knowing it.

Here's not news -- it's pimple-simple that Language Poets were reflexively
aware of a / their medium! They had a specific sense of it (friends = paper
= typewriter = recorder = magazines = city = books = etc) developed by / for
themselfs. Their sense of a "medium" is different than it would be for a
Listserv -- obviously (friends? archive? etc). They are by no stretch of the
dim lands of peace, not by any other conceivable sense, the "first" poets to
be reflexively attuned to their medium -- as some of them (i.e. those
editing and writing essays) have been the "first" to attest, in so many
ways, over and over (hence the need for a historical frame on all this,
perfesser). For Language Poets, by gum (but this would be true of anyone, is
true of us, here; what I am saying is intentionally plain, but I don't mean
to condescend), level of reflexive awareness varied (I use the past tense to
invoke an elementary sense of history as a narrating frame -- and not in
order to comment on the relation of Language Poets or oif any other kind of
poet to the present tense) from confused to articulate, depending on poet --
i.e., depending on circumstance, education, etc. Level of awareness varied
depending on what each poet thought that the name "LP" might entail, as an
identifying sign (some embraced it; some helped to create what others
embraced; others maintained the embracers and the creators; others changed
the terms of it all as it went on; some kept a distance but were happy to be
taken along, so long as others kept doing the work of keeping it going, and
so long as things went swimmingly; some internally, rightfully contested;
you tell me the rest; et cetera). Level of awareness varied depending on
what each LP-identified magazine’s editorial goals were thought to be --
before, once, and after being published. Level of awareness varied depending
on the degree, kind, and origin of idiosyncratic aesthetic and social
influences that were recognized (by anyone, to differing degrees) to be at
significant variance with perceived (from within, from without) LP
commonalities. Et cetera.

Some might say that we cannot ever become aware of the Listserv as a medium,
in any properly reflexive way, insofar as Language Poetry remains the
comparative model of what a medium is and what being reflexively aware of a
medium entails. I don't, obviously, think this to be the case. And I'm not
alone, if recent posts are to judge -- and they are; why not?: As a
Listserv, we no longer have even the most foggiest clue anymore who or what
in hell the Language Poets were, are, or are going to be! Not even Barrett
Watten cares to know! That's why he's joined the List! And, "Language
Poetry" is not a stumbling-block to achieving a present-tense reflexive
awareness of the Listserv as a medium because of "Oedipalitis" either --
that is, because of a certain bragadaccio attitude vis a vis poetry
predecessors, among white males who have consistently dominated the Listserv
since its foundation (at times worse than at others). Pimple-simple: the
reason why Language Poetry ain't an issue, never was, is the medium of
collective address here is differently constituted (refrain: if only we'd
recognize this for what it can ideally be, and is, regardless of what we
thinks it is, or thinks it can be).

The reason why I feel stupidly compelled to state this actually longstanding
opinion of mine (within months of subscribing) is because Language Poetry
("as such") and this Listserv are "now" being compared to each other,
diachronically and synchronically, and I'm reminded of it because I've just
recently begun to read the Listserv again (comes and goes, as I'm sure it
does for most of you), spitoon by spitoon. Diachronically, of course it
should be obvious to anyone that Charles Bernstein is founding specter of
the Listserv; but, it is nevertheless only with (far as I know -- please
tell me otherwise) Barrett Watten’s essay, "Secret History" (1999) that this
fact is reflexively and theoretically raised specifically in order to
rearticulate new meaning for, not Charles Bernstein (only), but Language
Poetry (as such). Diachronically also, Barrett Watten considers the Listserv
to be an outgrowth of Language Poetry (for two reasons, mentioned below).
Synchronically, the question of what Language Poetry "is" -- as recent
discussions also witness -- remains still alive with some of us (other
synchronic factors include, as some have also recently mentioned, the
"presence" of "Language Poets" "on" the Listserv).

I think Barrett Watten is correct (in "Secret History") to identify poetry
and community as the two founding and generative qualties (and opening
question marks) that make it plausible to compare Language Poetry and this
Listserv with each other in the first place (why _Legend_ is the *only*
model, not one of a number of possible models -- some of which Barrett
Watten himself raises -- remains unclear to me in terms of his essay, even
as I understand that _Legend_ is obviously central to the specificity of his
argument...; this has to be an aside).

So in other words, these observations I am making here about the Listserv as
a "time-based project" only make sense, really, if one reflexively agrees,
like Rousseau's democratic cabbagery, that Poetry and Community are indeed
the founding motivators for bringing attention to the medium as such (there
are plenty of other possible motivators, however, but these two happen to be
the ones that founded Language Poetry; for example, while Charles Bernstein
has recently complicated the idea of "community," it is plain as the nose in
my day that in his early essays "community" existed on the page, in the
word; I'm sorry to only refer by name to the people I am, as they don't need
attention so much as others do, but, think of it as a way of keeping this at
the level of the obvious). We all already by default, to a certain degree,
agree to these two premises (their basis forms Barrett Watten's link from
the Listserv back to Language Poetgry as a historical formation] by virtue
of being subscribed to a poetry Listserv in which any post, even a blank
one, is automatically "addressed" to captive others, who in turn respond,
even if they don't (a very basic definition of "community"). Poetry and
community are our default settings, as EPC Listserv subscribers. What we do
as a result has always been up to us.

"Listserv," in all the above, might refer to any listserv. I started los
PhillyTalks (http://phillytalks.org)-- another "time-based project" (any
series of poetry events is that), but not a listserv -- because of
frustrations with the low level of reflexive attention that was being
brought to this Listserv as a medium. Others left the Listerv and started
their own, yet surprisingly identified themselves in relation to this one,
by calling themselves a "sub" listserv (and curiously, yet others want to be
re-admitted to this one here, as if they're fallen angels, and this is the
only, you know, one; etc).

If not "Oedipalitis"---

Hey Louis, great post (maybe David Hess will even
find an answer to his "materiality" question here)---

So, this listserv is more diffuse than language poetry?
Yet at the same time more culturally inconsequential?

I often wonder about the use of the word "oedipal"
(seen most recently by me in BK Stefan's interview
with Miles Champion), and how it seems strangely
incommensurate (what the hell) with the anti-freud
project of many or even most who "deploy" that term
often pejoratively.....

But am very interested in the attention to medium---
I like to say THE BOOK'S the thing
as I am enjoying your MOOD EMBOSSER
but I'm actually enjoying your posts AS MUCH
and in some ways MORE than the book
(and I hope you will take this in the right way)
even as I will DELETE the posts
(knowing they're archived somewhere if need be)
as I don't TAPE RECORD my phone conversations

and this may be an invitation to see
listserv as like labratory,
where thoughts are worked out
feelings acted out, etc.
and maybe later shaped into something for a BOOK---

And though I "privilege the book" as such,
it's still the possibility of community
(as oppossed to the community of possibility?)
that draws me here (rather than say to frequent
a reading series)--it was once necessity---
sequestered in Albany, New York when I joined in 1994
and now may be seen a convenience
(being in the Bay Area "mecca")---
"may be seen"--

The listserv not really as community
but as a "site of contestation" from which
a community may yet be, uh, "avowed"

The possibility here as great as in those
splinter "sub" groups of which you speak---
Actually, a wider range here--
Dross to be sure....
too much "mere publicity function"
(and I will not deny partaking in it)

But it's not really SUBORDINATED to the BOOK
especially for those of us who do admire and envy
(though this is NOT, I say, in any way, OEDIPAL)
the way many of the writers that may now be
historically called "language poets"
seeemed to succeed in "fomenting an alternative
youth culture" (actually, a phrase I'm borrowing
from a chapter on FUGAZI in "OUR BAND COULD
BE YOUR LIFE).....well, for THEM they did
given the proviso that "youth" in poetry
is generally older than youth in indie-rock of the 80s was....

To pursue this analogy further
(as Clint Burnham is goading me too---
OFF THIS LISTSERV but NOT ANYMORE),
just as indie bands in the 80s made money off relentless touring
and did albums to promote the live shows
(which inverts the "corporate rock scenario")
maybe active participants of the listserv accrue
what Michael Scharf loves to call "symbolic capital"
through relentless posting, and write poems or books
to promote the "let-it-loose let-it-rip" ness of their posts....

Well, maybe not quite the analogy....
I mean I don't want to subordinate the books to this medium either...
But, of course, one problem some of us have
(and I don't even claim it's entirely "generational"
much less "oedipal") is that we have NOT found
a community akin (oops "kin" as choice of word
implies "family" which implies "romance"
and that brings us back to FREUD) to the Lang. Po.
alternative publishing network thing....
which is not just a matter of the difficulty in
trying to find publishers for our books
(though that's no doubt part of it....)

okay, enough pseudo-sophisticated whining for now....

Chris

Sorry Leonard, but in Internet parlance "flaming" implies personal
insult of people involved in an online discussion as a way of
avoiding the substance of discussion. It's a particularly vile kind
of ad hominem "argument."

Though I have to admit that I'm not following this exchange with a
fine-toothed comb; at this time, in this exchange, you seem to be the
only using terms like "cretins" to describe members of the list
because you disagree with the content of their arguments.

More generally, regardless of the recent change in administering the
list, there has often been extreme differences in political opinions
posted to the poetics list, and much more so since September 11th. As
a long time reader of the list, though an infrequent participant,
especially of late, I don't see a marked increase in this, though
there may recently be somewhat less tolerance for people positing
minority opinions including a variety of opinions that aren't always
easily classifiable using old-line left-right dichotomies. Looking at
what's posted to the list overall, it's hard to read it as favoring
one view of these situations over another.

And whatever "censorship" there is in the history of the list, in my
reading of the issues, the controversies were rarely about the
politics of non-poetic situations such as those currently under
discussion and were more often about how people dealt with presenting
and responding to positions in the very real politics of the poetry
scene.

Bests,

Herb

   The Opies' work and scholarship were amazing to me, back in a college
folklore course.   I remember how astonished I was to read that 'ring around
the rosy' was a literal description of a bubonic plague sore, or bubo,
'pockets full of posies' was the popular folk-preventative to sweeten the
air one breathed since it was thought the plague was a result of an ill
humor in the air, and 'ashes, ashes, all fall down' was about the burning of
corpses (and bedding and clothing) and the mortality rate.

Leonard, perhaps you could explain to me how publicly objecting to your
behavior, while refraining from insulting you, amounts to a "cowardly
personal attack."

 Cretins: poor things heads like eggs without yolks, thryoidism caused by
lack of iodine, push fish inland. All creatures of our ... out yourselves
now... i am just old and weary long time sufferer of multiple but undiagnosed
God knows what, this latest word wars make me believe that the emperor has no
clothes on capitalism is often an excuse for abominations and lastly the
wizard of oz is a good metaphor for y today's so called leaders in closing
maybe it's a so called blessing in disguise i have no grandchildren sorry for
the unquoted cliches the grinding poverty I see here in jc and the atrocities
I see/read media listservs makes me just want to stay in bed all day with my
newly adopted formerly abused dumped cat who came to dinner in the fall.

sorry dyslexic girl forgot to sign last post Sheila  also i always get a
smirk when i think back to my forced Sunday school days at a rock ribbed
Presbyterian church i did get quite an education in comparative
religion/philosophy but the fact that the church sent us Presbyterian life a
glossy magazine which told us how great rev sun young moon was and to PLS
remember his great works in our offerings i.e. send cash i laugh until i
cried when i read De Lillos book on him, well based loosley on him since we
have more lawyers than any other profession why because we want
accountability except personal think bushhe bro who is banished yet whose kid
is becoming a model think institutional racism on campus grammar mavens Vs
the others my idea of a good time is to put all the native grammar ratchets
on a boat enroll them in less elite atmospheres in another language and watch
them short circuit we do here forget that an MD is a body plumber bring back
the normal schools throw out these babies who never lived authentically with
their own bathwater Sheila

yes, listserv as a lab. and also a factory --albeit, maybe "workshop" is a
better word, in the ouvoir sense rather than mfa sense --meaning, a place
where discourse is proliferated, to create a texture that creates a
community and a vocabulary etc, for inquiry into specific issues (though
optimally not all that specific, w/ permeable boundaries and borders) --and
this proliferation, ephemeral as it is, may find longer life in some of the
more "finished" artifacts based on it (Barrett's article, the book
poetics@, various papers etc and poems etc), an eternal (or --what a
grandiose word, "eternal"! --ongoing) semi-submerged, spectral presence in
more overtly "public" and "finished" discourse...

Hello List

"We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual
horns. Now if we don't blow them, who will?" --George Sanders

My first novel, The Chandler Apartments, is just hitting (a few) stores. It's
a mystery based in the Berkeley poetry world (with apologies to the ghost of
Jack Spicer). Lots of familiar characters, and a charmingly flimsy plot. It's
a 13.95 trade paperback published by Creative Arts Books. If you can't find
it SPD should have copies.

"Owen Hill's breathless, sly and insouciant mystery is full of that rare Dawn
Powell-ish essence: fictional gossip...Poets have all the fun,
apparently."--Jonathan Lethem

Thank you

Weird; with all these demanding restrictions it's hard to fathom why anyone
would bother... how much are the worthy "submissives" paid?

Simon & Schuster Brings Hemingway to the Internet=20

April 30, 2002 =20
 =20
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ernest Hemingway is going online, marking what
publisher Simon & Schuster said is the first time the collection of a
major literary writer will be made available electronically.=20

The Viacom Inc. unit said Tuesday Hemingway's entire list of books,
including literary classics like "A Farewell to Arms" and "For Whom the
Bell Tolls," will be available in the electronic book format beginning
in August.=20

Each e-title can be downloaded for $9.99, *below the list price* for
most paperback versions.=20

"This is an important first step in creating a complete, scholarly
electronic library for Hemingway, as well as bringing our classic
backlist into the new era of digital publishing," said Susan Moldow,
executive vice president of Scribner, the Simon & Schuster unit that has
been the exclusive American publisher of Hemingway's books for 75 years.


However, one industry analyst said the move was unlikely do much for the
sector, which has seen several publishers scale back their e-book
ventures in the last year. E-books have been slow to gain favor with the
masses, often because they are hard to read and hard to find.=20

"The (industry) is pretty stagnant. The best advantage of this market is
not for consumer fiction books, better for journals and trade books,
travel guides and textbooks," said Jupiter Media Metrix analyst David
Card.=20

I've been called a "cretin" on the famed 'Poetics
List.'

There's got to be some kind of 'rebellious bohemian'
credential that's earned by that?

Am I a bad-ass now?

I agree.  In fact, most of the guidelines seem to me things any submitter,
you would think, would not have to be told.   I note, too, the absence of a
reading fee. I wish I had something lying around to submit.

To: Brad -

The restrictions sound pretty standard Brad.

Many journals normally just pay with a complementary issue if you get in.
They aren't getting rich here.

I am irked by your tone enough to go out of lurker mode and chime in here.
Why be so combative publicly on the list?  Is this supposed to be a
negotiating tactic?  Why not simply backchannel your reply directly to Ian,
"If accepted in the journal, do we get paid or get copies of the journal?"
If you're not going to get enough $$ to your satisfaction, then don't
submit.

I think the goal in presenting poetry in journals, public spaces, public
radio, etc.  is to provide a space for poets to present their work and
reach an audience.  While the internet is great, I still appreciate the
efforts of people to tackle all of the work and expense in putting out a
print project.  Even with a short run of 500 copies, it is often hard to
recoup costs. Why poo poo the effort with words like "it's hard to fathom
why anyone would bother..."

Maybe you are just having a nasty day or maybe you are just a jerk.  Why
spread your negativity?

It's true that the term "avant-garde" has been used
less in the poetry world and more in the visual arts
market.  Poets, like Cage, sometimes wear
"experimentalist" more comfortably ("experimentalist"
was how the New York Times classed Robert Creeley when
he and Michael Palmer were inducted as chancelors of
the Academy of American Poets, in response to
"minority" pressure).  ---What once could've been
called "avant-garde" is now usually being referred to
(misnomer) by this vague umbrella term "Language
Poetry" that's taken on obsessional redundancy.

But Martin Corless-Smith, Sheila Murphy, and
Jukka-Pekka Kervinen, all published in
http://www.wordforword.info , come as close as any to
being avant-garde, though, I'd say.  "Avant-garde"
must always be used in contradistinction to a more
assimilated doppelganger: they, and everything in
wordforword, are ~stridently~ avant-garde, if compared
to a Stephen Dobyns or Stephen Dunn.  Poets may
conglomerate into a de facto "avant-garde" when they
cease to operate as isolated agents, loners, and
coordinate (are coordinatd) into a self-conscious
group formation that's mutually aware of each other
and cross-pollinated.  Without that, a writer-artist
remains ~"outsider art"/eccentric~ (and even then can
be recuperated into an avant-garde, like the Douanier
Rousseau's paintings or ~Les Chants de Maldoror~ being
appropriated under surrealism).


> Poets write for their peers, for their self, out of
an impulse, or intellect, or whatever. If it's
received as such then it's a measure of living. <


That very self-enclosure (peers, self), though, may be
one of the ways in which the activity can be seen as
falling under a spectre of (theory-)death, a sort of
secret society ethos: an ~insularity~ that's, by that
very admission, sealed off from circulation with the
general economy or eco-system that would constitute
"living" (except through limited ministrations such as
the academy, which, in fact, death-ifies what it
treats by converting its object of study into a
~specimen,~ critical vivisection).  "Theory-death"
becomes measured by the (ineffectual/restricted) reach
of an avant-garde's/poetry's ~effect.~

Anyone's resistance to being labeled "dead" is, of
course, understandable and expectable.  Again, though,
it is ~not~ a negative or dismissive judgment.  But
this Paul Mann notion of "theory-death" may be more
like ~brain-dead,~ in an otherwise living and
expanding life support creature, ---or "spiritually
dead": it does not signal termination, quite the
contrary.  The inert can still expand.  ---Or, a more
Pop example, "dead" as in The Dead Heads (way
past-their-time followers of the rock band The
Grateful Dead, notorious for their LSD-induced
spaciness, fossilization and anemia).

(For that matter, is rock-&-roll an avant-garde?
"Rock Is Dead" was rock's own battle cry.  The
generational perpetuation of avant-garde poetry right
now is very similar to the continual self-perpetuation
of 3-minute song, guitarist band rock as an
"alternative," as a counter-culture.  The continuation
of "Language Poetry" parallels the only other main
multi-generational bohemianism: Punk, which roughly
spans the same '80s-into-'00s zomby-ism.) (There are,
admittedly, extreme problems with transplating Mann's
term from the aether of high theory into applied
cases, as I was doing; and there are problems with the
term itself, which could presumably be replaced by a
less melodramatic one.)

The ~gratification~ I find in the term "zombie
avant-garde"---    :)    ---is in fact very literally
played out, as demonstrated by the recent fad of
self-generating language machines such as
Jukka-Pekka's, which Chris Alexander wrote on

http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0204&L=poetics&D=1&O=A&P=
17622

and

http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0204&L=poetics&D=1&O=A&P=
18019


zombies, also popular in philosophy right now, are
moving bodies that essentially lack consciousness,
like poetry machines or "chance-generated processes."


> Plenty of folks are busily, and happily, at work,
perhaps too much so to worry about its death. <


Another analogy, that retains the mood of "happily":
the fundamentalist Christian use of self-identifying
death in figures such as "dead in Christ," "dead to
the world," "dead to Sin," etc (by baptism and
salvation).
And busy-ness itself may be a form of hypertrophy (or
viralization).

I do not find theory-death to be a source of ~worry.~
To the contrary, it comes to me with a kind of ~glee.~
 (And I am not married to the term or concept, just
presently infatuated.  In May, we'll talk maypole.)
wordforword was handy in that it offered such a
~cornucopia~ of specific death evidence; examples can
be drawn from other sources.  I find it freeing,
rather, since there's a Puritanical repressiveness in
our poetry community/America about the whole
~possibility~ of death: that would be too lyrically
elegiac, that would be too concrete.  And discovering
a point of linkage at which (theory-)death can be
looped back into poetics seemed constructive to me,
since it restores the great Omissions that this
quarter century's avant-garde poetry has juggernauted
through without any blip of incorporation: AIDS, and
now our New York necropolis, friendly fire casualties,
and the new warfare by suicide.

Other eras, such as Bataille's or the avant-garde
Jacques-Louis David's "Death of Socrates," were less
squeamish and foreclosed toward such forces.

Dear All:

Our big (and final?) event of the season is this Friday, May 3rd: a reading
and talk with guests Michael Palmer and Norma Cole. The weather looks
promising, and with luck we'll be able to throw open the porch doors and
have an inside/outside get-together. More space = bring your friends! We'd
love for everyone to make it for the potluck dinner starting at 6:30, as we
are already nostalgic for conversations; the reading itself will begin at
eight sharp.

Please note that this is a changed date; the event was originally scheduled
for May 9th.

We look forward to seeing you,

Joshua
Jen

c21p events are held at the Berkeley Center for Writing, 2275 Virginia
Street (between Spruce and Arch); all are welcome, and dancing is expected
after the event. If you have any questions, please contact

Jeffrey, I do appreciate your theory; and I can even see some evidence of
what you're saying, especially in Jon Thompson's work, which is, after all,
deliberately archaeological; but, as you do admit, this is not necessarily
problematic, nor cause for a knee-jerk value-judgement. I do, however,
think you're stretching your case much, much too far in your comments
regarding, for just one example, Pavelich's poem ("pure zero drive
repetition compulsion in David Pavelich's rearranged lines"). What is "pure
zero drive," as you use the phrase here?" I don't get it. And is
replication + variation, which is what the poem explores, at least in part,
always this "pure zero drive?" What would that say about, oh, fractal
geometry, cell division, or human reproduction? I don't see a viable
application of theory-death here. To talk of this particular poem,
especially, in terms of theory-death (which is otherwise interesting and
useful) seems glib and not at all very useful. I don't want to be a bore,
or seem TOO defensive, so I won't go on any further about it. I'm sure you
understand. 'Nuff said.

I too will come out of lurker mode for this one...

We here at ixnay press do accept e-mailed submissions, but, for all the good
of electronic communications, there's certainly been a downside to those kind
of submissions. I'd say the number of people submitting to the mag who've
never actually seen it has increased dramatically over the years, while our
overall readership has grown at a much slower  rate. Many more people, it
seems, are interesting in getting their poems into a mag they've never seen
than spending the money to check out the quality of the mag first. From a
writer's point of view, I understand some of the motives for doing so; from
an editor's point of view, tho...

It's awfully easy to see a mag's name on a list somewhere and fire off some
poems, and I think e-mail has made this sort of shotgunning even easier. It's
hard as an editor to take the time to wade thru all of those submissions when
75% of the people would've known they weren't a match for the mag if they'd
ever seen it or even visited our website. So I can imagine an editor not even
wanting to open up that (electronic) avenue...

As for paying contributors even a token fee, I dunno. We lose $$$ on each
issue or maybe come close to breaking even, & I can't imagine being required
to dole out cash to each contributor on top of their free copies. The idea of
cash payment in the small press world strikes me as the most bizarre part of
this dialogue.

I think print poets who submit regularly to pront journals and get rejected
and look at tons of authors' guidelines see these thigs differently from web
poets who are used to just having to give as URL and not having heavy
competeition for many venues.  Funny thing is, you get more recognition from
the easier, web, route, and it sometimes even leads to print...  But print
is still the way for Real Poets and I aspire to it but submit (and
resumbmit)rarely enough that I will never succeed that way...

The restrictions sound pretty standard Brad.

Many journals normally just pay with a complementary issue if you get in.
They aren't getting rich here.

I am irked by your tone enough to go out of lurker mode and chime in here.
Why be so combative publicly on the list?  Is this supposed to be a
negotiating tactic?  Why not simply backchannel your reply directly to Ian,
"If accepted in the journal, do we get paid or get copies of the journal?"
If you're not going to get enough $$ to your satisfaction, then don't
submit.

I think the goal in presenting poetry in journals, public spaces, public
radio, etc.  is to provide a space for poets to present their work and
reach an audience.  While the internet is great, I still appreciate the
efforts of people to tackle all of the work and expense in putting out a
print project.  Even with a short run of 500 copies, it is often hard to
recoup costs. Why poo poo the effort with words like "it's hard to fathom
why anyone would bother..."

Maybe you are just having a nasty day or maybe you are just a jerk.  Why
spread your negativity?

This is a fascinating discussion, especially in recent posts by Millie and
Chris.  It's helpful to hear the concerns of a print journal editor.  I'm
more like Millie; I publish about 2/3 web and 1/3 print, so I guess I
qualify as a 'web poet'. I love reading poems at websites and contributing
to websites.  VeRT has been amazin' and Jim Behrle does wonderful work, for
example. Well and then there's Jacket, one of the best joints around.  In a
big way I think those journals are more vital, more appropriate to our
literary/cultural milieu than any of the thousands of obscure (but still
terribly difficult to get published in) print journals.  Print still does
have more cachet in terms of, like, when you're being introduced at a
reading, though. I've noticed introducers reading only recognizable print
journal names in my introductions. Perhaps they have more "bio power."
Which is such a lame thing.  Just give us the damned poems, I say.  The only
reason you'd need all your "credibility" trotted out before reading is
because people don't know what the fuck they're listening to.  They need to
know how much to enjoy what they're hearing.  For once I'd like an
introducer to say, "You know, Belz is boss. He's tops. Check this shit out.
Afterwards we're all getting drunk. Belz?"  Something along those lines.

To make this point I once wrote my own power-bio chock full of falsities,
which I'll append.   It felt like writing an epitaph!

BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION FOR ALL PUBLIC APPEARANCES

Native Canadian poet Aaron Belz currently serves as the Director of Poetry
Studies at Marcel University, where he edits the award-winning literary
magazine Nomenclature. Mr. Belz's poetry has appeared in a diverse array of
venues, including Sabbath Bear, Red Moon Quarterly, Nevermore, Cloud City
Review, Symposium, Nomenclature, The Nation and Poetry Scoop, and has been
nominated for awards such as the Ashland Prize and the Coover County
Citation of Excellence. His third collection, What the Body Lost, is due in
August from Ragweed Editions.

++++++++++

Praise for Aaron Belz's second book, Love of Angels:

"Eerily harrowing. A haunting pericope of human loss, where melancholy meets
maleficence. Buy it." --Annie Keller, True South Quarterly

"A droll yet sunny bouquet of half-poems. A harrowing collection."
--Ilya Holden, editor of Contemporary Literary Bestiary

"Alarming yet soothing. Consider the territory of tongue-in-cheek
conquered."  --Mike Klemenger, The Vancouver Daily Gazette

"This surprising debut should surprise even the most jaded, ashtray-mouth
critic. The poet is alive. What we have here is a foundation to build on.
Buy it." --Publishers Weekly

 "Harrowing yet almost debilitatingly self-aware. A keen, surprising
collection of poems set in the half-light of consciousness, where sorrow
crosses paths with despair." --Kirkus Reviews

"What a joy to discover such a treasure trove of stock imagery. In the
shadows where the eery meets the obvious, we have found Belz's book."
--Tom Banneker, Yukon Quarterly

I didn't have a problem with the call for submissions. I sent two poems =
to 88.=20

Any magazine has the right to determine its own policies.  A policy that =
works for me might not work for you. The editor has to choose what works =
for him or her. It's not my magazine.

If I don't like a magazine's required format for submissions, I don't =
submit. Because of the way my lines run over the page, I prefer to =
submit poems as file attachments or surface mail, not as part of my =
e-mail, which would require extensive time and formatting on my part. On =
days when I feel differently, I take the time to reformat and submit.

Believe me, the policy that was posted is not nearly as painful or =
inconvenient as Cancer, racial discrimination, rape, terrorist attacks =
or nuclear holocaust.=20

What I want from a submission call is information about what the publication
hopes to accomplish, what it is measuring itself against.

Modest format impediments to submission strike me as a good thing.  If one
has to think a bit about whether or not to trouble with the process is that a
bad thing?

Good things, bad things, you know I've had my share.

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

So much that's funny here, Aaron, but here's my seconding for more intros
in this vein (and the ideas behind it):

"For once I'd like an
>introducer to say, "You know, Belz is boss. He's tops. Check this shit out.
>Afterwards we're all getting drunk. Belz?" "

Can we vote on making that the new standard format for poet intros at
readings?  Really, I mean it.

tell you what, brad, start up a journal, or a chapbook series, & see how
much money you are able to pull in in order to pay your contributors. while
you're at it, see how willing you are to receive e-mail after e-mail (with
attachments mind you) from people asking you to consider their work for
publication.

duration press does not accept unsolicited manuscripts from anyone who
writes primarily in english (we prefer translated material). duration press
pays its authors with 10% of the print run, nothing more. duration press has
yet to break even after 19 titles.

call them abuses, but i'd like to think of them as guidelines by which we
are able to operate our organizations.

  at the Flying Saucer Cafe
  494 Atlantic Avenue Brooklyn
  on the evening of Tuesday May 7
  at 8 pm

.........................for AN  EVENING OF
COLLABORATIONS.................................

FEATURING

JOE ELLIOT + MITCH HIGHFILL
PATRICK DURGIN + JEN HOFER

with a collaborative introduction by

GARY SULLIVAN + NADA GORDON


**Joe Elliot co-edits Situations, a chapbook series. His book,
Opposable Thumb, is forthcoming from SubPress.

**Mitch Highfill is the author of The Blue Dahlia, and has a book
forthcoming from Situations, Koenig's Sphere.

Joe & Mitch will read from their collaborative take on and dialogue
about the Exeter Book, a 10th Century anonymous compilation of
West-Saxon riddles.

                ...........................more.........................



**Patrick F. Durgin's most recent publication is an e-book from
Duration Press, Sorter (2001 - see:  www.durationpress.com).  In
1998, he initiated the Kenning series of "newsletters" and chapbooks
(information at:  www.durationpress.com/kenning), the most recent of
which is a double-cd featuring audio editions of works by three
generations of authors, composers, artists (it also includes the
first audio edition of Leslie Scalapino's book WAY).  Diologues with
poet Andrew Levy and prose writer Bandon Stosuy are newly published
by Antennae and Rust Talks, respectively.

  **Jen Hofer is a poet & translator originally from the San Francisco
Bay Area. Her books include _as far as_ (a+bend press, 1999), _The
3:15 Experiment_ (with Lee Ann Brown, Danika Dinsmore & Bernadette
Mayer, The Owl Press, 2001), _Laws_ (A.BACUS #139, with drawings by
Melissa Dyne, Potes & Poets Press, 2001), and _Slide Rule_ (subpress,
2002). She edited and translated an anthology of contemporary poetry
by Mexican women, _Inscrutable Geometry, Avidity_, which will be
co-published by University of Pittsburgh Press and Ediciones Sin
Nombre in 2003. Recent work can be found in Antennae, Chain, Enough,
HOW2 and Kenning (audio edition). In collaboration with the artist
Melissa Dyne, she constructed a large-scale camera obscura in a plaza
on a busy corner in downtown Mexico City in April, 2002 which will be
open to the public for a year.

Patrick's statement about his collaboration with Jen:  "Jen and I
have been discussing what I was calling a "potential synaesthetic
poetics" in a piece published in Tripwire's second issue, "Writing as
Activism" (1998) - those discussions became a devoted correspondence
and a collaborative poem.  Both components play into a larger
gathering of material we envision making sometime down the road, all
revolving around but not limited to the issues pertaining to
synaesthesia I, for better or worse, brought up in my Tripwire piece.
A synaesthetic poetics, we keep suggesting, takes intersubjectivity
as a material textual condition.  Excerpts from the poem appear in
recent / forthcoming issues of the following journals:  Aufgabe,
Bombay Gin, Chain, Combo, and !factorial.  This will be the first
time we read together from a newly "scored" version of the poem.  It
will also be the first time we've been able to spend any time
together, face-to-face, in three years."

HOW TO GET THERE: Take the 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or D or Q to the Atlantic
Subway stop and walk underground to the Pacific Street exit (at the N or R
or M Pacific Street Stop) or take the B or N or R or M - in any case, go
out the Pacific Street Exit (right exit), take a right - at the end of the
block you will be on Atlantic Ave. Take a left on Atlantic, and about two
and a half blocks down, between Third and Nevins, you will find the Flying
Saucer Cafe.

----------------------------------------------------------

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT LANGUAGE POETRY


Q.  What is the definition of Language poetry?

A.  There is no single, universally accepted definition of Language poetry.
There are many reasons for this (not the least of which is the cliche "one
man's Language poet is another's freedom fighter").  Even different agencies
of the US government have different working definitions.  Most definitions
usually have common elements, though, oriented around Language poetry as the
systematic use of radical linguistic disjunction--actual or
threatened--against readers but with an audience broader than the immediate
victims in mind to create a general climate of aporia in a target
population, in order to effect some kind of poetic and / or social change.

Q.  What is the main cause of Language poetry?

A.  Dissatisfaction with a poetic or social system or policy, and an
inability to change it through "mainstream" or non-disjunctive means.

Q.  Is Language poetry ever, in any situation, justifiable in this day and
age?

A.  For any act of Language poetry, there is always a poetic, social,
political, or philosophic creed that can be used to justify it by someone.
To "justify" an act, one must compare it with a legal or ideological system
as a basis of justification.  If one considers an act "justifiable," one
probably wouldn't call it Language poetry.

Q.  Do you feel governments should fund Language-centered organizations?
Why or Why not?

A.  NO, for the same reason governments should not conduct acts against
international literature or their own literatures.  Governments should
always seek to stay within the arena of peaceful competition among literary
movements.  Poetic radical disjunction is outside of this arena.

Q.  What impact does the media have on Language-centered acts?

A.  Language poetry and the media have a symbiotic relationship.  Without
the media, Language poets would receive no exposure, their cause would go
ignored, and no climate of aporia would be generated.  Language poetry is
futile without publicity, and the media generates much of this publicity.

Q.  Do Language poets use the media as a means of promoting their beliefs
and opinions?

A.  Absolutely.

Q.  Should media report these acts of Language poetry? Why or Why not?

A.  The media are within their prerogative of informing the public as long
as they are passive observers of events.  When they become active
participants in a Language-centered situation, or otherwise irresponsibily
confuse readers or the public, or knowingly become a vehicle of biased
propaganda, then that particular member of the media is abusing the power
protected by the US Bill of Rights' First Amendment.

Q.  Do you feel that Language poetry can be stopped? Why or Why not?

A.  Not as long as there are dissatisfied people in the world.  This does
not mean that States should not strive to stop Language-centered actions.

Q.  Should military action be taken against Language-centered communities?

A.  On a case-by-case basis, military action can be warranted. Firstly, some
international Language-centered incidents demand a response for which
literary enforcement has neither the training, resources, nor personnel.  In
these cases, military forces might be the only adequate response.
Furthermore, some communities support Language-centered campaigns as actual
instruments of their poetic theory.  If this support results in harm to
American citizens or interests, then the supporting community has executed
an act of defamiliarization against the United States.  Such acts by
definition warrant a military response.

Q.  In what ways do Language poets gain publicity?

A.  By confusing people, frustrating readers, and blowing things up.

Q.  Do you feel that Language poets are "freedom fighters" or criminals?

A.  If they are deforming the literatures of the communities in which they
operate, they are by definition criminals.  As far as being freedom
fighters--that's a moral judgement beyond the purview of objective academic
research.

Q.  What is the future of Language poetry?

A.  The trends point to decreasing frequency but increasing obliqueness of
acts.

Q.  What effect does technology have on Language poetry?

A.  Language poets use technology that is cost-effective, minimizes
comprehension, and helps to effect their goals.

Q.  What are some motives behind Language poetry?

A.  Political (e.g. West Coast Faction), religious (e.g. aleatory
extremism), ethnic (e.g. hate speech), social (e.g. single-issue such as
anti-confessionalism).

Q.  Do you feel that Language poetry is becoming more and more of a threat
to the United States?

A.  In the short term, yes.  American readers, group aesthetics, and
literary communities continue to find themselves in areas of increasing
poetic instability.  This makes them vulnerable to anti-lyrical,
anti-mainstream, or other extremist acts.  Domestically, there seems to be
increasing trends of experimental rhetoric and activity throughout the
United States--some of which manifests itself in radical disjunction.  In
the long term, whether these trends pose an increasing threat to America
depends on a number of variables, including changes in international and
domestic poetic currents, how the public and media react to Language poetry,
how governments deal with Language poetry, and whether the Language poets
themselves discontinue or change strategies and tactics.

If the goal of your poetry writing is to get paid, then I would suggest a
radical career rethinking. Perhaps copywriting or Hollywood.

I edit a  small poetry journal, and essentially take a bath with finances
each issue that comes out. I would love to pay everyone much more than
copies, but that would mean closing the doors. I am fairly certain that the
same goes for most (90-odd %) of other small press ventures. And if all
these journals/mags/zines shut, we'd all be at the mercy of the New Yorker
and Atlantic Monthly.

I had thought along these lines in fact I was thinking of 'abandoning" what
amounted to a conceptual project when it ocurred to me that in a way the
List is a kind of model for or is analagous to a kind of unending poem.
(thus somewhat subverting or "beating  my concept to the poetic punch"..)
Which has the potentiality (and is in actuality) at least to a kind of
polylogical and procesional poem or project: it is actually and
theoretically also a kind of discourse with conflicting or disparate
elements, there is a sense that ''everyone is involved", the limitations of
being "published" on the List are mainly those of physical and time
limitations, links add to Bernstein's "hyperreality". Of course the idea,
the concept of it, is greater than its actualisation ( if it was aof a
greater "political" signifiance then we might feel that our debates were
getting "out there", they pobably are more  and less than we think or hope:
but even as we grizzle or contribute or whatever, the whole project moves
"foreward" (hopefuly like a river): in a sense analagous to life, which in
its turn is like a large disjointed yet flowing poem: a digital river,
disjointed yet joined. And Alan Sondheim pours HIS great project on
regardless: the msuic of theis Digital Coceptual and early 21st Cent
"projeect" is like Charles Ives's great msuic with its intermixtures and
clashes of "hihg" and  "low", harmony and diharmony. It is not just an
American phenomenom: there are people either from or living in other
countries, such as myself and the odd Australian: a huge List...the Big
Daddy List is the ultimate "project", in many languages by many nationals in
many media with many appproaches, and with a constant dialogue (that of
course is never as exhilerating or "revelatory" as essays etc but they can
be accessed either on or off line or via the links or other related, and
depending on how "bright" one feels, its a great fest: (or how dispirited,
its rather dull and overburdened by "announcements"), like life its
impossible to predict where its going, its a endless experiment: everything
and anyone could contribute to it (conceptually or potentially at least),
and as far as we know it has no end and it would be difficult to circle the
beginning. Richard.
