What does exactly "weird platonism" mean? Could you explain. What is weird
about them? Does that mean that one is not agreeing with what he is saying.
It is easy to call someone crazy under the circumstances. It has happened
quite often. I would really appreciate if someone can explain this
"weirdness." Is it weird because Platonism is weird" or it is weird because
he misreads Platonism or is it weird just because he was crazy?

As for "wittgenstein was a terrific poet mistaken for a logician by some":
that sounds a complete put down to me. It is like saying a woman should sta=
y
home and raise children.

Jim, recently I talked to someone who had just graduated from Princeton
College majoring in philosophy. It appeared to me -though he tried to cover
it- he had not heard of Descartes's "cogito ergo sum." He had failed to pic=
k
up a reference to it. I understand the whole philosophy department at
Princeton focuses on symbolic logic?

No Plato, no Descartes -all relegated to the realm of "poetry," etc. Is tha=
t
what one means by "weird," that it is not symbolic logic?

Ciao,

Murat

VOX PRESS, INC (a non-profit literary press in Oxford, Mississippi) is in
its initial stages of organizing a literary symposium for the summer of
2011, in Oxford. Mississippi. The purpose of the symposium will be to
examine the current state of small press literary publishing, with
particular emphasis on the problems and challenges faced by small presses
and the resources and innovations that publishers like yourself are using to
achieve your mission. In order for VOX to have a better understanding of how
the small press literary world might benefit most from this event, please
take a few moments and respond to the following questions:

Based upon your experience, what are the key challenges and concerns that
small presses face today? (Please list in order of importance.)
On a scale of 1 to 6 (with 1 meaning "not at all interested" and 6 meaning
"extremely interested"), how interested would you be in attending a
symposium designed to examine and address these challenges?
If you would be interested in attending this type of symposium, which of the
challenges and concerns that you identified would you most like to included
in the event? (Please list in order of preference.)
What resources, innovations, solutions, etc. have you found to be most
useful in addressing the challenges and concerns that you face in your work?
What type of formats and activities (e.g., formal presentations, panel
discussions, workshops, "best practice" presentations, etc.) would be most
useful for examining and addressing these concerns in a symposium setting?
Have you or any other members of your press ever participated in a literary
symposium or festival of this sort? If so, did you find that to be a
satisfying experience? How could it have been improved? What specific
benefits did you gain from participating?

If you are interested in this type of symposium, can you think of any
problems or obstacles that might prevent you from attending and/or
participating in the event?

Would you be interested in leading a workshop or participating in a panel
discussion on one of the topics that you have identified above? (While the
topics will be largely determined by the responses of potential
participants, topics for the symposium might include: goals and strategies
for greater inclusiveness, the role of new technologies, etc.)
Would you be interested in writing an essay and/or giving a lecture on the
theme: What Is the Current State and/or the Future of Literary Small Press
Publishing in the 21st Century? Are there other related themes about which
you would be interested in writing an essay and/or giving a lecture?
Finally, are there any other issues that you would like to raise or
recommendations that you would like to make for us at this time as we begin
the initial planning for this event?
Thank you for your response. Your comments and recommendations will play a
vital role in the design and implementation of a literary symposium for you
and your colleagues in the small press community.
























Hi everybody, You could send replies to me and I would forward them to

"Wittgenstein never accepted Gödel's result; he said in The Foundations of
Mathematics, posthumously published, that his task is not to discuss Gödel,
but rather to bypass Gödel. He also called Gödel's results the tricks of a
logical conjurer, logical artifices."
from http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/goldstein05/goldstein05_index.html

my feeling is that there was no room for godel's work in wittgenstein's
world view. he needed to not discuss godel but to bypass him.

wittgenstein's work in mathematical logic is not even remotely as important
as that of godel. and godel's work is beautiful in a way that challenges any
poet writing pretty conjectures and enigmatic pronouncements. it's beautiful
and it's true. it's expressed in proofs that have stood the test of time. it
uses the equally beautiful work of georg cantor, uses his diagonal argument
(which was also used later by turing). it's the most significant work of
mathematical logic of the twentieth century. it eclipses the work of any
poet on mathematical logic. it redefines the poetry and philosophy of
mathematical logic.

i think wittgenstein thought this sort of genuinely remarkable work in meta
mathematics was simply impossible, that it was 'unsayable', and that his own
sort of poetry was as good as it got.

godel shows us what really excellent work in mathematical logic is.

Throughout this discussion, I contemplated a major edit to a
softly-published (blogspot) poem, which contrasts scientific and
spiritual ways of understanding. It always read ambiguously, so I
finally cleaned it up in order to make the ambivalence more
pronounced.

FIT LANGUAGE
after Richard Dawkins

science doesn't unweave
the poetry of a rainbow
but justly strips the gods
of shuttle and warped
claims with sparkling webs
which trick and trap
then ungraciously
collapse
when fitter words appear
explaining why life is
too short
for many their meager bliss
snuffed out
and for others too long

moments of joy
and terror
are not balanced
with the precision of
a blind watchmaker
or blamed on
a reckless devil's chaplain
who adapts to survive
innocent of intent

is cause
a humbler palliation
or is it true
everything happens
for a reason

I know that's the fashionable view among mathematicians and =20
philosophers of mathematics who don't want to have to address the fact =20=

that Wittgenstein called them out for a level of metaphysical =20
spookiness that most don't want to admit to like good scientific =20
materialists, but that argument, including Godel's remarks on the =20
matter, doesn't really comprehend what's going on in the remarks on =20
the foundations of mathematics where Godel sentences are being =20
discussed. It's also, I think, quite uncharitable to attribute that =20
imprecision of thought to attribute the mistake that Wittgenstein is =20
supposed to have made (that is, thinking that the incompleteness =20
theorem was somehow incorrect) to a mathematical logician capable of =20
holding his own among the likes of Bertrand Russell, Frank Ramsey, and =20=

John Maynard Keynes, Alan Turing, and Piero Sraffa, all of whom were =20
in some way influenced by him at some point.  Wittgenstein didn't =20
dismiss or misunderstand the result, it's just that on his view of how =20=

mathematics worked, which was influenced by Brouwer and his own work =20
on Frege and Russell's views, it's relatively trivial that there are =20
true but unprovable statements in any significantly complex formal =20
system, which is the only consequence of the theorem that he ever =20
wrote anything about and even then, only as notes to himself for =20
lectures and not anything he intended for public consumption. My guess =20=

is that he'd probably argue the law of the excluded middle would be =20
such a proposition true but unprovable assumption in Brouwer's system =20=

for example. I think in Wittgenstein's view that would be more or less =20=

an obvious result of the constructed nature of mathematical language =20
that he maintained at least from 1930 until the end of his life.

but what matters is that the remarks on the foundations of mathematics =20=

are primarily aimed at Russell and Whitehead's attempt in the =20
Principles of Mathematics to ground arithmetic in formal logic, and =20
where he probably screwed up was in his remarks about set theory, =20
although I'm not convinced that that rejection isn't more of a =20
reaction to the strange metaphysical character of sets themselves as =20
opposed to any real trouble with the mathematics. As such, I think the =20=

Godel remarks really can only be read as a misunderstanding of =20
incompleteness when they aren't seen in the light of being made really =20=

as an attack on the

if you're curious, Hilary Putnam and Juliet Floyd put forward an =20
interesting reading of the "Notorious" paragraphs about the =20
Incompleteness Theorem. P&F argues rather convincingly, I think, that =20=

Wittgenstein's remarks on Godel are actually about problems of =20
translation from sentence letters in PM as a result of what Godel had =20=

shown. That is, that the results reveal a semantic problem in moving =20
from formalized semantics of the sort that are provably complete (like =20=

Russell's system) but not, hypothetically, consistent  to natural =20
language semantics. Which, if they're right and that is what he was =20
talking about in that fairly gnomic paragraph, is a pretty interesting =20=

insight into what the first incompleteness theorem establishes. P&F go =20=

so far as to make the case that he was actually anticipating something =20=

like model theory, and I think that's a bit of a stretch because I =20
don't know that Wittgenstein would have cared all that much for how =20
Tarski conceptualized models, but he does make a good case. The paper =20=

is here: http://www.scribd.com/doc/88248/Wittgenstein-on-Godel and =20
some defenses of objections to it by people who really want to save =20
the "wittgenstein didn't understand math, so what use is he as a =20
philosopher" argument here: =
http://www.bu.edu/philo/faculty/Ramharter_vol_on_Goedel.pdf

Also, it should be remembered Wittgenstein only saw in the original =20
paper by Godel with its reliance on the Skolem lemma and without the =20
benefit of the many adjunct improvements on the theory, or indeed =20
Kleene's Church-Turing thesis about computability drawing on the =20
lambda calculus and Turing's work with the halting problem--which i =20
think represents the first real synthesis of all the previosly occult =20=

and esoteric work on algorithms and computability into something more =20=

interesting than just poking David Hilbert's corpse with a sharp =20
stick--didn't appear until after poor uncle ludwig had passed on. =20
Which is to say, when W was writing about Godel in 1937, what matters =20=

in understanding Wittgenstein on Godel is Wittgenstein didn't care at =20=

all about the big issue results of the first incompleteness theorem, =20
that is that there can't be a complete formalization of mathematics =20
even as basic a mathematics as Peano Arithmetic that is complete and =20
consistent. Which, again, was something that Wittgenstein felt he'd =20
more or less demonstrated in the Tractatus, and seemed very much like =20=

a non sequitur to him, when the real issues in matehmatics was to =20
combat the insidious philosophical importations present in formalism =20
and platonism. which, notably, the incompleteness theorems as you say =20=

are completely agnostic towards.

The Turing/Wittgenstein discussions are really great and I highly =20
recommend them. They're transcribed in a book called Wittgenstein's =20
Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics 1939, which is based on the =20=

shorthand transcripts of, I think, Rush Rhees, Alice Ambrose, GH von =20
Wright, Peter Geach and Norman Malcolm. I think reasonable people can =20=

disagree about who got the upper hand more often, but seeing the two =20
of them go back and forth is pretty astonishing and I'm forever =20
jealous of the people who were in the room to watch it as it happened.

Also, I think you're giving him a bit of a short shrift as a logician. =20=

He did invent truth tables, after all, and that's a fairly significant =20=

contribution, as is the notion of "truth conditions" which first =20
appears in the tractatus and is now more or less indispensable in =20
talking about semantics in logical terms.

yeah, but reading him as a positivist is a total misunderstanding of
his work. The reason that stuff shows up in positivism is because
carnap and weissman completely misunderstood the tractatus as saying
something it definitely was not, ie those things that can't be talked
about or empirically investigated are themselves worthless and
nonexistent. which is not the case. he just thought LANGUAGE about
those things was nonsensical, but not that whatever the language about
htose things was trying to express was delusional or wrong. that's
where his mysticism lies, which is what very few people, including I
think most wittgenstein scholars, fail to appreciate. I'm in fairly
good company with my reading though, because I think Ray Monk and
Jurgen Habermas's readings of him coincide with mine, albeit with a
few differences.

for that second argument to work you'd have to accept something like
David Lewis's resolution to the problem of universals which relies on
set theory and modal realism, which I just don't buy. Again, I'll
appeal to wittgenstein's remark that "when you are learning spelling
you also learn how to spell the word "spelling" but no one calls this
a second order spelling." or to put it another way, to quote dennett's
sarcastic remark about a wittgensteinian ordinary language philosopher
"if it can't be expressed in first order predicate logic, it's
probably incorrect and meaningless."

I just really disagree with the notion that Wittgenstein held to
anything like the idea that language was absolute and final in any
way. Rather he thought it was limited, amorphous, changeable, and in
no way capable of covering the wider extent of human life, which for
him was a precondition for language that meaning requires. hence the
comment "if a lion could talk we would not understand him."

And again, I'll return to probably the poorest understood aspect of
wittgenstein's view of language which is that the things that can not
be said can in fact be shown. they can be demonstrated. they can be
pointed at indexically. what they can't be is explained, described,
discussed, or whatever. If i want you to understand a religious
experience, for example, i might give you a set of instructions that
might allow you to recreate the experience for yourself, but if i
start trying to describe it, then I begin to start talking in a way
that isn't strictly meaningful in the way that other propositions are.
Which, again, is why "philosophy ought to be written only as a form of
poetry." Because poetic language is capable of showing in a way that
ordinary language is not.

As for the Arcades project, it sounds really interesting, but it also
doesn't sound like the same use of the word "true" as one uses in
talking about propositions and the truth functions of logic and
reasoning. Here again, the later wittgenstein is informative and i
would appeal to the notion of family resemblances. Just because one
uses the same word doesn't mean one is saying the same thing. And it
sounds to me like what you're talking about in the arcades project is
something with a kinship to the truth that exists in rational
argument, but that is not fully the same thing. And I think that's
fair and Wittgenstein would allow for that. Again, to me whatever
disagreement we seem to have, and I don't think it's a huge one, seems
to be over how to understand what Wittgenstein believed about
language. So far I don't really think there's much that you've pointed
at that doesn't fit into his conception of language in some way.

Jim,

Is anybody claiming that Wittgenstein is a mathematician, unless you are
equating philosophy and mathematics (which you may be doing) and saying tha=
t
the only philosophy which is possible today is some kind of mathematical
logic. You are comparing apples and oranges. When we are talking about
Wittgenstein's or Godel's poetry, it seems to me, we are basically using
metaphors.

It has always been accepted that an elegant mathematical proof (or process)
has a beauty of its own. But that does not mean it is a beauty created by
words.

As for Godels proofs being "beautiful and true. it's expressed in proofs
that have stood the test of time," you are squirting a main issue in logica=
l
positivism and in Wittgenstein: "can a mathematical proof be "true" in the
empirical sense ("truths" expressed in prepositional statements). In that
sense does mathematics tell us anything about the world though its
applications undoubtedly affect it. Of course here I tend to be more on you=
r
side since, as I said in my previous, the distinctions between
objective-subjective, emprical/nonsensical, etc. are essentially arbitrary
abstractions at best and basically  illusionary.

As for Wittgenstein skirting God's argument, that's his modus of thought. H=
e
does the same withmetaphysical, ethical assertions about the world, saying
they are nonsensical.

Ciao,

Murat

Jason,

"yeah, but reading him as a positivist is a total misunderstanding of his
work. The reason that stuff shows up in positivism is because carnap and
weissman completely misunderstood the tractatus as saying something it
definitely was not, ie those things that can't be talked about or
empirically investigated are themselves worthless and nonexistent. which is
not the case. he just thought LANGUAGE about those things was nonsensical,
but not that whatever the language about htose things was trying to express
was delusional or wrong. that's where his mysticism lies, which is what very
few people, including I think most wittgenstein scholars, fail to
appreciate. I'm in fairly good company with my reading though, because I
think Ray Monk and Jurgen Habermas's readings of him coincide with mine,
albeit with a few differences."

those things that can't be talked about or empirically investigated are
themselves worthless and nonexistent. which is not the case. he just thought
LANGUAGE about those things was nonsensical: don't you think this assertions
itself is somewhat strange? What is exactly the difference between
"worthless, nonexistent and nonsensical" unless the word "nonsensical" is
being used here as a technical term used by Logical Positivists. In other
words, how much of a real difference is that outside atmospherics?

"for that second argument to work you'd have to accept something like David
Lewis's resolution to the problem of universals which relies on set theory
and modal realism, which I just don't buy. Again, I'll appeal to
wittgenstein's remark that "when you are learning spelling you also learn
how to spell the word "spelling" but no one calls this a second order
spelling." or to put it another way, to quote dennett's sarcastic remark
about a wittgensteinian ordinary language philosopher "if it can't be
expressed in first order predicate logic, it's probably incorrect and
meaningless."

I think we misunderstand each other here. What I mean is that any given set
(language) can be broken down (Benjamin's view). If it can be broken down,
it can be "escaped" and talked about or pointed to. Perhaps we should talk
more about this process of pointing of "pointing" which both Wittgenstein
and Heiddeger talk about. I think they are striving towards a similar thing.

"I just really disagree with the notion that Wittgenstein held to anything
like the idea that language was absolute and final in any way. Rather he
thought it was limited, amorphous, changeable, and in no way capable of
covering the wider extent of human life, which for him was a precondition
for language that meaning requires. hence the comment "if a lion could talk
we would not understand him."

Well, he may believe all of that; but when he relegates the language of a
"the wider extent of human life" to the category" to being "nonsensical," he
is creating a hierarchy of values (truths/and nonsensense, both
"important?") which I can not quite accept or live with.

"And again, I'll return to probably the poorest understood aspect of
wittgenstein's view of language which is that the things that can not be
said can in fact be shown. they can be demonstrated. they can be pointed at
indexically. what they can't be is explained, described, discussed, or
whatever."

Why not? We discuss these things all the time. What are we doing now?

"If i want you to understand a religious experience, for example, i might
give you a set of instructions that might allow you to recreate the
experience for yourself, but if i start trying to describe it, then I begin
to start talking in a way that isn't strictly meaningful in the way that
other propositions are."

Here one can see how the phrase "in a way that isn't strictly meaningful in
the way that other propositions are" is giving to everything which can be
expressed in propositions over over things. As I said in my previous post,
my disagreement with Wittgenstein is partly rhetorical, the hierartchical
value system it creates and leads many others to stup and very restrictive
conclusions or practices.

Take for instance, Normal Malcolm argument about dreaming, that dreaming can
be reduced to a reporting of dreaming since, for convoluted reasons he
explains in his book, nobody can prove that his/her dreaming occurred during
sleep. The ridiculous argument he follows there is very similar to what you
say in " "If i want you to understand a religious experience, for example, i
might give you a set of instructions that might allow you to recreate the
experience for yourself, but if i start trying to describe it, then I begin
to start talking in a way that isn't strictly meaningful in the way that
other propositions are."

 "Which, again, is why "philosophy ought to be written only as a form of
poetry." Because poetic language is capable of showing in a way that
ordinary language is not."

Why not say then poetry is as much capable of philosophy as symbolic logic?
It is not nonsensical truth, etc., etc. etc.

"As for the Arcades project, it sounds really interesting, but it also
doesn't sound like the same use of the word "true" as one uses in talking
about propositions and the truth functions of logic and reasoning.

That's what I mean. Instinctively, you are assigning -and I believe
restricting- the "truth" value to one mode of expression and not the others.
The Arcades Project talks about social, political, ethical, philosophical,
aesthetic, moral issues in a synthesized language. That is its originality.
Those hierarchies of truth -creating a hierarchy of validities and subtle
taboos (like "weird mysticism or Platonism") are eliminated.

"Here again, the later wittgenstein is informative and i would appeal to the
notion of family resemblances. Just because one uses the same word doesn't
mean one is saying the same thing."

As I said before, my primary objection to Wittgenstein is rhetorical, and
since one sees everything through the prism of language, that is a lot.

 And it sounds to me like what you're talking about in the arcades project
is something with a kinship to the truth that exists in rational argument,
but that is not fully the same thing. And I think that's fair and
Wittgenstein would allow for that. Again, to me whatever disagreement we
seem to have, and I don't think it's a huge one, seems to be over how to
understand what Wittgenstein believed about language. So far I don't really
think there's much that you've pointed at that doesn't fit into his
conception of language in some way.

I agree with you, Jason. Our disagreements on Wittgenstein are less than
they appear. I am more focused on what Witggenstein has become to mean
-which basically is a very restrictive and even damaging, particularly in
poetry)- after himself.

Once again, great conversation.

Ciao,

Murat

hi all,

In his essay Obscurity in Poetry, John C. Goodman, editor of ditch,
cites various works that have been obscure in poetry, from 1066 to
today. He discusses some of the motivations behind non-narrative
poetry, including the human mind's ability and interest in non
-linear connections, and urges us to consider the works in terms of
writers' intentions.

> I know that's the fashionable view among mathematicians and
philosophers of mathematics who don't want to have to address the fact
that Wittgenstein called them out for a level of metaphysical
spookiness that most don't want to admit to like good scientific
materialists,

Most mathematicians are work-a-day Platonists. They assume mathematical
entities 'exist' in the sense that their properties remain invariant and the
standard systems of mathematics are relatively consistent (relative to
arithmetic) and they don't have to worry about the entities being
contradictory anytime soon--probably never.

Most would also probably believe that "arithmetical truths are independent
of any human activity", but don't think about it much.

> but that argument, including Godel's remarks on the
matter, doesn't really comprehend what's going on in the remarks on
the foundations of mathematics where Godel sentences are being
discussed. It's also, I think, quite uncharitable to attribute that
imprecision of thought to attribute the mistake that Wittgenstein is
supposed to have made (that is, thinking that the incompleteness
theorem was somehow incorrect) to a mathematical logician capable of
holding his own among the likes of Bertrand Russell, Frank Ramsey, and
John Maynard Keynes, Alan Turing, and Piero Sraffa, all of whom were
in some way influenced by him at some point.  Wittgenstein didn't
dismiss or misunderstand the result, it's just that on his view of how
mathematics worked, which was influenced by Brouwer and his own work
on Frege and Russell's views, it's relatively trivial that there are
true but unprovable statements in any significantly complex formal
system, which is the only consequence of the theorem that he ever
wrote anything about and even then, only as notes to himself for
lectures and not anything he intended for public consumption.

Trivial? Well, no, it's not trivial. True but unprovable statements
(undecidable statements) cannot be construed as yer run-of-the-mill axiom A.
Yer run-of-the-mill axiom A is 'independent'. That is, one may assume A or
~A (but not both) and still end up with a consistent system (provided the
rest are consistent). Typically, the system does not imply anything already
about axioms. But, in the case of undecidable propositions, the system rules
out their falsity. The negation of an undecidable statement is definitely
false. Undecidable propositions were a whole new type of cat.

Godel showed that in sufficiently powerful formal systems, such propositions
necessarily exist. So what? Well, it means that such formal systems are
never 'complete' in the sense that there's always going to be more
undecidable propositions, no matter how you go to town on it. He proved it
ain't over even after the fat lady sings.

One of the burning questions of the time in which Godel did his work was
whether math was basically over. If it's possible to build a theorem proving
machine that will prove all provable theorems (and it is), then, so the
argument ran, math is over. Let the machine do the proofs and we'll find
something more interesting to do. What Godel showed was that there are
always going to be more unprovable but true propositions. The machine
obviously can't prove all true propositions, cuz some of them are
unprovable. OK, then, can it decide which propositions are true and which
are false?

Well, no. Surprisingly. "One consequence of the halting problem's
undecidability is that there cannot be a general algorithm that decides
whether a given statement about natural numbers is true or not." (quoted
from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem ). That is, Turing's work
on the Halting problem--which demonstrated a task no conceivable machine
could ever satisfactorily accomplish--also gives us the answer to various
other questions such as this one.

Godel and Turing weren't out to create Windows or computers. They were out
to solve outstanding mathematical and somewhat philosophical problems.

Godel and Turing showed that math can never be 'over'. For even if we built
a machine that could prove all provable theorems--and apparently there's no
reason why we couldn't do that--we *cannot* build a machine that provides us
with all true propositions.

> My guess
is that he'd probably argue the law of the excluded middle would be
such a proposition true but unprovable assumption in Brouwer's system
for example.

One of the differences Godel made is that Wittgenstein would have to prove
it. Godel took meta mathematics from the realm of loosely conjectural
philosophy into the realm of proof and logic.

Godel's work AS POETRY. There is no more beautiful work in or concerning
meta mathematics. And it's engagement with language is profound. Godel
numbering of all propositions. This redefines how we should think of poetry.
It's the intensity of engagement with language and truth that matters, in
this consideration.

This is the spiritual underpinning of things like OULIPO. Or so it seems to
me at the moment.

I hope to respond more to your provocative and thoughtful post, Jason. But
for now I have to try to fix dbCinema, which is broken. Google changed their
image search stuff. Yeesh.

Yeah, I know people say that. They're absolutely completely wrong. =20
Goldstein's not alone in that, lots of people think that's what =20
Wittgenstein said. It isn't. The fact that there are lots of peoeple =20
who completely fail to understand Wittgenstein is neither new nor =20
interesting. The bulk of the philosophy departments at every school in =20=

England and America are obsessed with problems that if they'd bothered =20=

t read and understand Philosophical Investigations would be revealed =20
as nothing of any importance at all. If you're genuinely curious and =20
not committed to a preconceived notion about the work he did on =20
mathematics, which is not complete or for that matter anything that he =20=

intended to be published as representative of his views, but are =20
still, I think compelling refutations of formalism, then read the =20
Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics. Read the Lectures on the =20
Foundations of Mathematics. Read the putnam & floyd paper that I =20
linked. it discusses specifically the paragraph Rebecca Goldtsein is =20
referring to and gives it a much more interesting and I think correct =20=

reading. To say that Wittgenstein didn't "accept" Godel's results (or =20=

axiomatic set theory's savior of Cantor from Russell's paradox for =20
that matter) is to completely misconstrue an semiotic and linguistic =20
position for a epistemological one.

As for Godel, I won't deny that the Incompleteness Theorems or his =20
earlier completeness theorem are important. they are. they're =20
strikingly original and they present a fundamental problem for =20
mathematics that  people are still grappling with. That said, they say =20=

nothing at all about what mathematics is or why it has the force that =20=

it does. Which is what Wittgenstein was thinking about and what he =20
meant about "bypassing godel." Which is important, if one remembers, =20
as one should, that Godel's '31 paper sent shock waves through the =20
world of academic logicians and it was all that anyone was talking =20
about in the thirties. Hell, it's still all that anyone talks about in =20=

mathematical logic courses at most universities. You need to do =20
graduate work to start learning about much that happened after the =20
nineteen forties. Godel is revolutionary in mathematics.

That said, walk into any Introductory Logic classroom in any =20
university in the world, and my guess is that at some point they're =20
going to talk about truth conditions and truth tables, and that's =20
Wittgenstein. I brought them up to refute your statement, that I think =20=

Murat rightly calls out as unfairly dismissive, that he was a poet not =20=

a logician. He made lasting contributions to how we think about truth =20=

in formal reasoning, and that's important work. Is it as important as =20=

Incompleteness? No, but who cares? Nothing is as world changing as =20
Incompleteness. It's the F=3DMA of mathematical logic. But it's not the =20=

be all and end all and there are other more important things to =20
consider, particularly once you've accepted the most important result =20=

of incompleteness which is that you can't ground mathematics in a =20
complete system of formal reasoning like the predicate calculus. Which =20=

from one point of view, is earthshaking, but frankly given the place =20
that Wittgenstein was at with his thinking on epistemology and =20
language by the mid thirties probably to him was not all that =20
surprising.

I didn't say that. don't think I implied that. didn't even think it.

Wittgenstein's or Godel's poetry, it seems to me, we are basically using
metaphors.

has a beauty of its own. But that does not mean it is a beauty created by
words.

Mathematics is written. There's a language associated with math. In some
schools, study of math gives you a foreign language credit.

The subject of Godel's work was language. He proves stuff about formal
systems. Formal systems are 'language games'. Open up the game box and you
have an alphabet, rules for constructing propositions, rules of inference,
existential and universal quantifiers, and so on.

In previous eras, language was not the subject of study of mathematics.

To read and understand Godel's work, like that of Cantor or Turing, is
simply thrilling and satisfying in a way that I associate with reading the
very best of poetry. And the subject of Godel's and Turing's work was
language, in the above sense. They inquire into some of the limits of
meaning and inquiry with language.

> As for Godels proofs being "beautiful and true. it's expressed in proofs
that have stood the test of time," you are squirting a main issue in logical
positivism and in Wittgenstein: "can a mathematical proof be "true" in the
empirical sense ("truths" expressed in prepositional statements). In that
sense does mathematics tell us anything about the world though its
applications undoubtedly affect it. Of course here I tend to be more on your
side since, as I said in my previous, the distinctions between
objective-subjective, emprical/nonsensical, etc. are essentially arbitrary
abstractions at best and basically  illusionary.

Sorry, Murat, I have no idea what you mean.

Hi all,

In a little under eight weeks, we'll be putting on our fourth annual
Welcome to Boog City festival, featuring poets, musicians, and
playwrights performing at four venues, in two boroughs, over five
days, from Fri. Sept. 24-Tues. Sept. 28. Among the over 60 performers
taking part are poets Steve Cannon, Laura Elrick, Farrah Field, John
Godfrey, E. Tracy Grinnell, Shafer Hall, Pierre Joris, Erica Kaufman,
Pattie McCarthy, Noelle Kocot, Douglas Rothschild, David Shapiro, and
Anne Waldman.

Ten days before the event, we'll be putting out the festival issue of
Boog City. This issue will feature pieces on some of the performers
and a full schedule, illustrated with images of each of the performers.

Advertising in the festival issue of Boog City means you will reach
more than 3,000 readers, poetry lovers, and small press aficionados
throughout the East Village, other targeted areas of lower Manhattan;
Williamsburg and Greenpoint, Brooklyn; as well as bonus distribution
at Boog City's monthly events. That's an increase of 33.3% over our
regular issues for no additional cost. And, since this issue is also a
program for the festival, readers will give it a closer read as they
check to see who's up later on that day and later on in the festival.

Boog City continues to offer our special Small Press Ad Rates. That
means when you advertise with us you will save 50% off of our regular
display ad rates.

      * Full Page        $220
      * Half-Page       $130
      * Quarter-Page   $70
      * Eighth-Page     $40

Here is a link to our full rate card:

http://www.welcometoboogcity.com/ad_rates.pdf

As I mentioned in previous emails to you, Boog City focuses on getting
the word out about lesser-known artists, be they poets, prose writers,
musicians, painters, photographers, or cartoonists. Each month we
publish poetry from the likes of Anselm Berrigan, Renee Gladman, Lisa
Jarnot, Eileen Myles, Kristin Prevallet, and Edwin Torres, alongside
our Urban Folk music section, small press book reviews, political
commentary, art, comics, and photographs.

We look forward to working with you to bring your message to the local
arts community to increase awareness and sales of your publications in
the New York area.

as ever,
David

That's really strange. As far as I know most undergrad philosophy =20
programs require a course in modern philosophy where you read =20
descartes, hume, berkeley, spinoza, leibniz, bacon, hobbes, locke, and =20=

kant.

the weird platonism I was referring to has to do with Godel's later =20
thinking which was heavily informed by Leibniz's monism which led him =20=

to a thoroughgoing idealism in almost everything, to the point where =20
he was willing to assert that mathematical forms of the platonic kind =20=

were the only real things and formed the monad's of Leibniz's =20
metaphysics. It's not weird because it's a weird view of the world and =20=

what it is, although I think it is pretty weird in that sense too, but =20=

rather because it rested, as I understand it, on disjunctive reasoning =20=

that either the mind was a sort of turing machine subject to halting =20
problems and other unsolvables, or it was capable of surpassing the =20
calculating powers of machines through access to the higher realm of =20
pure mathematics. The latter which he used to deny "brain as turing =20
machine" thinking was founded very much on some metaphysical and =20
religious thinking which to my mind is not particularly appropriate =20
for making those kinds of arguments. the weirdness is not the claim, =20
that is, because platonism is no weirder than formalism to my way of =20
thinking, but the manner by which it was argued for, which from my =20
point of view looks to be very similar to a religious attitude for =20
Godel. Which, while weird, I also think is kind of admirable even if =20
it's completely wrong. But then, I feel the same way about Berkeley =20
and spinoza, although not so much leibniz.

Thanks, Jason, for the opening for me to chime in on this thread.

The reason I was a religion and not a philosophy major was there were too
many gang bang history of philo surveys forcing study of a bunch of white
guys.  My specialty was mysticism.

As I mentioned in passing on my blog, what it more problematic in this
discussion to me is that, 1) Adam's sparking essay totally ignored the HUGE
amount of experimental women's poetry which has a spiritual, if not
religious, dimension.  It's across traditions and practices.  It includes
most of the "major" writers.  So I feel like the initial spark was based on
-- dunno -- not reading Scalapino?  Blau DuPlessis?  Karasick?  Hillman?
 Carson?  Ronk?  Fanny Howe?   Then, what about the writers influenced by
the transcendentalism of Emerson?  Lauterbach?  Brown?, 2) isn't it callow
to call for an increased spirituality when it is the population that does
not believe in any vague spirituality, is secular, may be radically
peaceful, is not twelve-stepping (see vague spirituality, is not Mary Karr
or Nick Flynn), may be under jihad, etc.,  that is under seige/on the
edge/writing in danger?

Admittedly, this is not to your point, but the call for a poetry that
includes ideas that are not part/cannot be part of anyone's direct
experience, but only part of their received beliefs/assumptions/cultural
conditioning:  the approved narrative, the way we always interpret these
things:  the opposite of poetry.

Then too, of course Cantor is spiritual, and you've done a good job
elucidating the aspects of ideas of the "ineffable" around W in particular,
but -- how is language exactly unable to deal with experience?  How is
experience -- gosh, can't communicate anything about it? How are the quotes
from religious texts about the bomb appropriate?  The Dao of Physics -- what
was THAT thing?

--
All best,
Catherine Daly

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CThe Blast Area=E2=80=9D by J=
ohn Tranter
=20
=20
Description:
=20
John Tranter's =E2=80=9CThe Blast Area=E2=80=9D (originally published as a =
pamphlet in 1974, and no longer in print) consists of poems that are varied=
 and strange, often veering away from common sense into a quirky surrealism=
. The final third of the book consists of 'The Poem in Love', a sequence of=
 fifteen pseudo-sonnets (set up by an epigraph from the possibly fictitious=
 Paul Ducasse) which critic Andrew Johnson noted, 'might stand for the vari=
ety of strategies we employ to make sense of the world, and for the fleetin=
g, unstable patterns we think we perceive in our experience. It's as if hav=
ing reached an extreme of cynicism about "meaning", Tranter lets it in thro=
ugh the back door, and a new-found humour wit

Jason,

I get your point.
Deleuse thought very highly of Liebniz.

There's more out there (many google-able reviews of Boone's recent
Century of Clouds reissue, for instance -- by Dana Ward, Colin Herd, &
others; or the 90s anthology BITING THE ERROR: WRITERS EXPLORE
NARRATIVE), but these would be my go-tos.  Kaplan Harris also had a very
helpful article in a recent issue of AMERICAN LITERATURE, tho it's not
public online: vol. 81 no. 4 (Dec. 2009): 805-832, in case you wanna
track it down.

An interesting thing for me is the way New Narrative concerns/poetics
articulated at the turn of the 80s dovetail in the early 90s so closely
with some of the writing being put out on Semiotexte's fantastic, mostly
NY-based "Native Agents" list curated by Chris Kraus: Kraus's own novels
(I LOVE DICK being something of a quantuum leap & manifesto), David
Rattray's wonderful HOW I BECAME ONE OF THE INVISIBLE, Eileen Myles's
patently non-Language 1st-person poems (see her remarks at the AdFemPo
conference last fall posted on Harriet ... & her novel THE INFERNO
finally came out, like, today), etc.  I've always been compelled by this
connection, but NN writers don't claim any influence on this somewhat
later stuff outside their 'official' roster; as Boone simply says,
"something was in the air" back then ...

best, Robbie

somebody else would have invented truth tables if he hadn't. they're like
shopping carts.

would somebody else have done godel's strikingly original work? probably.
eventually. but probably it would have taken quite a while.

i am attempting to download "Cora Diamond [Ed.] - Wittgenstein's Lectures on
the Foundations of Mathematics, 1939". meanwhile, i've perused
http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein-mathematics and the links you
provided, jason.

wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics is doomed to the obscurity suffered
by other similarly finitistic approaches. he objects to set theory on
philosophical grounds. which is fine but that sort of objection is not
nearly as important as showing real contradictions in the theory. he didn't
manage to do that.

the 'crisis of the foundations of mathematics' in the nineteenth century
that motivated the development of set theory, including cantor's work on
infinite sets, included an atmosphere in which there was great distrust
about assumptions of the actually infinite. cantor's work was widely
regarded as fatally flawed for its assumption of the existence of the
actually infinite. the famous antagonisms of kronecker and poincare against
cantor, and cantor's relegation to the margins of academia. and his ongoing
battles with mental problems. and cantor's own exacerbation of his problems
by his pronouncement that the existence of his transfinite numbers was
justified in the mind of god.

but cantor and others were sufficiently careful in their dealings with the
actually infinite that it has not, in fact, blown up in their faces. every
undergraduate honours math student does a course in 'real analysis' that
develops the real number system from the ground up using set theory and
cantor's work (among many others).

finitistic approaches, very famously, generally have difficulty proving many
of the most useful results of mathematics. the results that any theory
simply has to be able to produce or no one uses the theory, regardless of
its philosophical nobility.

by the way, jason, as an aside, when i studied cantor's work as an
undergrad, well, it really blew me away as beautiful and profound. i
understood why, going back to the time of pythagoras, mathematics has been
associated with 'divine knowledge'. i mean, in the case of cantor's work, we
learn things actually worth knowing about the infinite. "no one shall expel
us from the paradise that cantor has created." david hilbert said that. and
no one has managed it. not wittgenstein, not brouwer, nobody. cantor isn't
the saviour. he was a 'martyr', of sorts (figuratively). so too with godel
and turing.

It's like old narrative, but newer. Eventually it will get old and
become the not so new but not as old as the old new narrative. My God,
a hundred years from now the Library of Congress system will be
inundated by huge strings of genre names.

Dear Listservers:


 Please see below, with regards to a roundtable discussion I'm organizing
for next year's Medieval Congress in Kalamazoo, MI. We are looking for 1-2
more participants who are engaging in a scholarly way with medieval
literature and contemporary poetics. Please back-channel to me if you are
interested. The congress takes place May 12-15, 2011.


 best,


 David

*Queering the Muse: Medieval Poetry and the Contemporary Poetic Imagination=
*



A Roundtable, with David Hadbawnik (SUNY-UB), Chris Piuma (U Toronto), Dan
Remein (NYU), Sean Reynolds (SUNY-UB), others TBD. Respondent: Eileen Joy.
Presiding: Anna Klosowska.



20th-century poets have long used the medieval for inspiration, notably Ezr=
a
Pound, whose version of *The Seafarer* marked an important step in his
poetic development, as well as being a superb contribution to the
Anglo-Saxon translation corpus in its own right. However, not enough though=
t
has been given to the ways in which contemporary poets reuse, reinterpret,
and otherwise engage with medieval poetic tropes and practices. How can
formally experimental =93translations=94 of Old English, which take into ac=
count
recent poetic and translation theory, be beneficial to the contemporary
avant-garde? Or, to turn the question around, how can quintessentially
contemporary reading and writing practices=97such as the game-based approac=
hes
of OuLiPo, Conceptual Art with its ideas of =93exhaustiveness=94 and boredo=
m,
and the use of factual/archival material=97provide ways of reading or
understanding medieval writing? The roundtable participants will explore th=
e
way such poetic practice constitutes a queer approach to medieval
translation, which results in a wilder, more experimental, and perhaps true=
r
way of understanding and engaging with the medieval poem.

Thank you, Christophe. I enjoyed reading your response even though it didn't
enlighten me one little bit. Still, the  humour was entertaining.

I think I am going to start a movement call Old Narrative. It will involve p=
utting old books in a blender and seeing what happens.

How does the New Narrative relate to New Narrativism, I wonder?

I had a similar experience with transfinite numbers in an advanced =20
logic class as an undergrad where we touched on real analysis on the =20
way to understanding completeness and consistency proofs. I had a =20
similar experience when my calculus instructor proved the power rule =20
for me in office hours. i would never think to deny that there's =20
something truly beautiful that goes on in mathematics, and I don't =20
think the German Engineer would have denied that either. Someday I =20
hope to be able as an old man to return to this stuff and study non-=20
euclidean geometry and mathematical logic again, because you're =20
absolutely right that it is a wonderful and amazing thing. Where I =20
think I differ from you Godel Turing and Cantor is that I'm not =20
comfortable moving from there to making metaphysical or ontological =20
claims about things like numbers or geometrical shapes. To me, this =20
stuff is just magic (per my def. of magic here: =
http://www.wetasphalt.com/content/magician-priest-conjurer-lawyer-law-myst=
icism-magic-and-occult)=20
  and there I think is probably Wittgenstein's biggest failing, in =20
that he didn't take his thoughts on magic far enough. Although he =20
rightly took Fraser to task for the Golden Bough interpretation of =20
shamanism, I think he didn't pursue the connection between magic, the =20=

inneffable, and religious ritual to the end that I think his view of =20
language allows.

As for truth tables, you're right, and provably so. Emil Post =20
developed them in the 1920s and can't have read the Tractatus, because =20=

it was as yet unpublished and unknown in the US. I do think the =20
semantic theory of truth embodied in his invention of truth conditions =20=

(Tractatus 4.4 and sub comments) is a significant contribution as =20
well, but even Wittgenstein might have debated that since he later =20
became something like a deflationist and his analysis of truth is one =20=

of the things that I think one can firmly point to as a definite =20
example of the differences between early and later Wittgenstein. That =20=

said, I think one goes a bit awry to think that Wittgenstein's import =20=

for mathematics rests solely on his contributions to mathematical =20
logic. I think, for example, there's no diminishing of the beauty of =20
mathematics if one adopts his antiplatonism, and I think he makes =20
strong arguments that a platonic theory of number, for example, has to =20=

answer. More importantly, I think he makes a strong connection between =20=

mathematical meaning and mathematical application. Which is to say, I =20=

think on a Wittgensteinian view, that the discovery that logarithms =20
were useful in the calculus and in chemistry gave new meaning to =20
logarithms that weren't there for the early inventors of logarithms =20
who had no knowledge of calculus, the physics of cosmology, or =20
scientific chemistry. They were primarily a short hand for dealing =20
with complex calculations involving ratios. I think this analysis as =20
finding new meaning for an old part of mathematics makes a lot more =20
sense of the human encounter with new mathematical applications than =20
does the platonic view that those mathematical entities already exist =20=

in the world waiting to be discovered whether people come along or =20
not. In fact I think it makes things like logarithms or the number i =20
more beautiful and even poetic in the fact that new meanings were =20
found for them long after they were invented. I often wish he had =20
lived a few more decades and could have seen the digital computer, =20
because I wonder what he would have made of the work Turing/Godel/=20
Church et. al. were doing after seeing them given the meaning that =20
calculating machines were able to make out of them. I think he would =20
have thought it was a wonderful thing.

And at the same time, I think, maybe, he might argue that some of the =20=

awe that everybody who grasps things like incompleteness, transfinite =20=

numbers, and decideability problems (which, interestingly, he had no =20
problem with. He thought that the halting problem was real and =20
incorporated some of Turings work on algorithms into his thoughts on =20
what mathematical meaning is) COULD be just the sort of giddiness one =20=

feels as a result of semantic paradoxes that come about through the =20
syntactic manipulation that goes on in mathematics. ALthough clearly =20
that's not the end of it, because the same thing happens like I said =20
for a proof of the power rule, or an elegant proof of the pythagorean =20=

theorem, which both have a clear semantic meaning even in =20
wittgenstein's sense of mathematical meaning. More importantly, while =20=

I'm not at all sure he's right, I think it is an interesting challenge =20=

to Set Theory to show that an infinite set should be analyzed as a =20
rule for the unlimited extension of a series, much the way that a =20
calculation that presents an irrational number is a rule about how to =20=

extend of the number to N+1 places, rather than an actual infinite =20
thing-in-itself. I'd be very curious if you knew of anything that =20
takes up that notion, because it's always struck me as very compelling =20=

although philosophers I respect and who understand this stuff better =20
than me (and who are otherwise sympathetic to Wittgenstein's view of =20
mathematics, like Putnam and Fine) have remarked in passing that they =20=

think he was wrong about how he analyzed the diagonal proof.

What matters to me though, particularly in the realm of how all of =20
this applies to poetry, is that I still think that semantic paradox is =20=

a useful tool of poetry that is very good at pointing to things that =20
might otherwise not be able to be expressed by other more normal =20
means. I think, for example, that the liar paradox is an interesting =20
way to approach the notion of divinity, something I used in a poem I'm =20=

very proud of that tries to express something about my experience of =20
the divine (published here if you're curious: =
http://www.blazevox.org/061-jfq.pdf)=20
. And I think that's useful in poetry, because I can't tell you what =20
it feels like to experience the divine in the same way that I can tell =20=

you that cutting my finger while chopping onions is painful. But I can =20=

try to create that feeling through poetry, and by talking in that sort =20=

of way, using that kind of approach where meaning is both looser and =20
also more pointed, I think poetry can express the otherwise =20
inexpressable, and that too is a kind of magic.

Finally, because I think you might enjoy it as it relates to =20
Wittgenstein's appreciation for Turing, I give you this remark from =20
the Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics:

"What harm is done e.g. by saying that God knows all irrational =20
numbers?  Or: that they are already there, even though we only know =20
certain of them?  Why are these pictures not harmless?
For one thing, they hide certain problems.

Suppose that people go on and on calculating the expansion of =CF=80. So =
=20
God, who knows everything, knows whether they will have reached =20
=E2=80=98777=E2=80=99 by the end of the world. But can his omniscience =
decide =20
whether they would have reached it after the end of the world?  It =20
cannot. I want to say: Even God can determine something mathematical =20
only by mathematics.  Even for him the mere rule of expansion cannot =20
decide anything that it does not decide for us.

We might put it like this: if the rule for the expansion has been =20
given us, a calculation can tell us that there is a =E2=80=982=E2=80=99 =
at the =20
fifth place. Could God have known this, without the calculation, =20
purely from the rule of expansion?  I want to say: No."

Cheers and thanks again for the opportunity to flex these particular =20
muscles. They do get rusty reading law books these days...

Short description/annotation:  A series of short texts or poems that revel
in structured and unstructured language, with all the gaps and excitement
that happens when language is stressed to the limit.

Main description:  In Sondheim.s Deep Language, writing detours through
digital and other media, returning with new forms and genres, new ways of
thinking philosophy, the body, religion, and everything else. This is a
series of poems that revel in structured and unstructured language, with
all the gaps and excitement that happens when language is stressed to the
limit.

These pieces cohere, interrelate, interpenetrate; they develop the concept
of deep language in any number of fascinating ways, ranging from intuitive
writing to the use of scripts, code, and programming to elucidate hidden
meanings . where none may have existed before.

Excerpt from book:

Unpublished endorsement:  Alan Sondheim writes. In fear of death . literal
fear, real fear, symbolic fear . he uses anything and everything at his
disposal to make and unmake himself and all of us as statements, words,
part-words, characters. Alan Sondheim is one of the precious few who
joyfully . and in abject misery . risks these terrors of writing for us,
for our pleasure and our undoing. What happens? Language disposes of us.

As if that were not all that is required of any writer, Alan Sondheim is
also the poet, the artist, the maker who has most profoundly immersed
himself and his work in the life-changing code-forms . of networked
computation . that have the world and its .genesis redux. in their grip.

incantations, true confessions, Platonic dialogues, shtick, tantrums,
aphorisms and manifesti. And that.s just the first 5 pieces! Maria Damon

Well, it's not used in the sense of the positivists, because the
positivists adopted their use of the term from him rather than the
other way around. He was never a positivist. His use of "sense" and
it's various associated terms (actually in german his use of Sinn,
unSinnig, and Sinnloss, sorry my german is worse than my french, which
is terrible) is technical and derives from his reading of Frege.
Frege's semantic theory asserts that there are two ways that a
sentence or a word has meaning, it's sense, and it's reference.
Usually this is talked about in terms of proper names, but Frege and
Wittgenstein took it further, in that the reference of a proper name
is the object that it attaches to like a label or a name tag. The
object to which the word refers. Or the referential meaning of "Jason
F Quackenbush" is me, the physical human being that has that name.
Frege argued that there are terms that have no reference but that do
have a sense. Take for example the name "Hamlet." There never was a
person with that name, he's a fictional character. And yet,
particularly within the context of the play, Hamlet definitely has a
meaning and it's the same meaning whether the actual physical person
playing Hamlet is Richard Burbage or Mel Gibson. (Granted you could
argue that different actors portrayals of Hamlet have slightly
different meanings since the character can be changed a bit, but I
would argue that the possibilities of portrayal are reasonably finite
and are all part of the meaning of the word). Anyway, That meaning is
the "sense" of the word "Hamlet" which exists separate from. So when
Wittgenstein says that a term like "Absolute Goodness" is nonsense, he
means it doesn't have a sense in the Fregean sense of the term. That
is, there are no criteria by which to determine the meaning of the
word. The mysticism of this point of view is that never the less he
recognizes that using a term like "Absolute Goodness" is trying to get
at SOMETHING, and whatever that something is it seems to have some
relation to more workaday uses of the word Good. The point in calling
it nonsense is something like Heidegger's admonition to always pay
attention to the phenomena first. That is, if you want to know what
"good" means or any of the other concepts that get built up into grand
metaphysical theories, don't let yourself drift away into the
philosophical ether where there's nothing to ground the meaning of the
words you're using the way that life as it is lived by people in
communities grounds the meaning of the language we use to communicate.
It's not nonsense in the sense that there's no there there, but
nonsense in the sense that if you start talking that way, the way
philosophers do, you're completely missing the point.

Ah, i see what you mean. I think you're right. I think maybe the
distinction then is that W. conceived of language, or more properly
meaning, as not a set, in the sense of a collection of things that
form a totality, but rather a series of nodes that are connected to
one another. I think he'd very much say that bits and pieces of it can
be talked about in isolation, and in fact that's what his "language
game" thought experiments were trying to do, to get at bits and pieces
of language in isolation to see how they worked. The only thing I
think he or I would have quibbled is that he would have rejected this
as something second order, and would have said it's just another
language game connected to all the other ones, and this is just a way
of talking about language, but it's not anything like a metalanguage.

I think that's probably a fair criticism. The only defense I'll offer
is that I don't think he was unaware that that's what he SEEMED to be
saying, and he often talked about how much he admired saints and
religious mystics who had devoted their lives to nonsense, and often
qualified his talk of nonsense by saying that even though its nonsense
he'd never dare try to dissuade people from talking about it. Rather
he just wanted his ideas to be a kind of therapy to allow people who
are persuaded by a certain kind of nonsense, that is the kind of
nonsense popular among the philosophically inclined, to stop
tormenting themselves with it because it never seems to get anywhere
and the more you think about it the harder it is to really believe
anything. And there he was speaking from experience. Bertrand Russell
reports in his diaries and letters that Wittgenstein would often burst
into his rooms at cambridge in the wee hours of the night talking
about killing himself because he couldn't stop thinking about some
puzzle or another and every time he felt like he'd got to an answer, a
bunch of new objections would spring into being. Which is to say, I
think he excludes from the negative value judgment that he makes about
philosophers nonsense, the kind of thing that I think could be fairly
called religious nonsense and poetic nonsense which themselves have
value (and therefore a kind of meaning) in their use as an important
part of human life even if they don't have the kind of meaning that a
sentence like "I'm wearing tennis shoes right now" has.

well for example. I can tell you how i came to experience a connection
to the divine. I can describe the physical and emotional feelings that
I had as a part of that experience, and I can suggest to you
activities that might help you recreate that experience myself. What I
can't do is tell you if God is real or imaginary, if it is male or
female. I can't tell you if it is a person that is intelligent or a
mindless force of nature. All of the sentences there would fail
because of the word being predicated, God, doesn't have a sense in the
Fregean sense. Rather, for me at least, it points to my experience of
the divine and that's the only way that I can talk about it in a way
that is meaningful. Compounding the problem is the fact that there are
other people who use the same word to mean the same thing I do, but
also in there experience is something that allows them to make those
kinds of statements. This is a fundamental disconnect that makes it
impossible for either of us to tell if we're using the word correctly
and there's no objective empirical object for us to go and take a look
at to figure out which one of us has the meaning right. So in a sense,
it's possible to talk about talking about those things, which is what
we're doing now, while it's very difficult, if not impossible, to talk
about them directly. And talking about talking about them, just like
as I suggested to Jim, using semantic paradox and metaphor and maybe
musical harmony, are ways to point at them, to give them a referential
meaning even though they don't have a sense.

Right but take that in the context of the whole corpus of what's being
said. Wittgenstein allowed for empirical truth, which is the vast bulk
of what propositions deal with, and more or less dismissed it as
needing any attention because it's obvious and easy. Take a look at my
feet, you'll see whether the proposition "I'm wearing tennis shoes" is
true or false. He distinguished another kind of truth, grammatical
truth, as being true of propositions that take as their object not
empirical facts but facts about how language is used and works. So for
example, "That apple is red" is true if in the language I'm speaking
red refers to the color of certain kinds of apples and if the apple
I'm pointing at (that being an indexical expression) is the color of
those kinds of apples. I can take this a step farther and say "some
apples are red" and I'm no longer really saying much that's empirical
so much as I'm saying something about how we talk about apples in the
English language. The proposition is true not because apples are a
certain color, although there's an element of this that's reflected in
the grammar, but if when people are talking about apples, they
sometimes use the word red to talk about their color. Grammatical
truth is a lot harder to get at and comprehend tho, than empirical
truth is, and most of what he wrote in his later period was about how
grammatical truth works for certain slippery word that are the
subjects of philosophical enquiry like epistemology and metaphysics.
For example if you agree to look after my dog while I'm on vacation, I
can say "that's good of you to do that for me." And the way to tell if
that's true or not is not so much empirical inquiry, but grammatical
inquiry into whether this is the sort of situation where the word good
expresses something. Partly this is a rejection of a metaphysical
conception of goodness as some eternal constant concept that the word
"good" refers to. But it's also because we can imagine a situation
where it would not be grammatical, like say I'm the Emperor and you
are one of my subjects so that the situation is really that you are
obliged to look after my dog if I tell you too and there is maybe even
a cultural expectation that you should be honored to be able to do me
a solid. In that case, "That's good of you" might mean something
slightly different, in that it's merely polite because that's what one
says to someone who takes care of something for you and it would be
perceived as rude not to say it. both are meaningful statements that
mean different things and are true only under specific circumstances
that are defined by how language is used by the people using it.

well, that's Malcolm, and he wasn't Wittgenstein's best exegete. That
someone dreamed something isn't, or at least wasn't at the time and is
barely so now, a matter that can be empirically investigated. But my
take on dreaming, which is I think what Wittgenstein had in mind, is
that it is like it is with other kinds of expressions of internal
sensations, the statement IS the evidence. If I tell someone a dream I
had while I was asleep. We know what dreams are, we all have them, and
we know what the report of the dream is. And we can doubt that someone
is being truthful in a dream report, and suppose that they are telling
us a lie for some reason (like perhaps they want to convince us they
had a precognitive experience of some kind), but that doubt requires
some grounds too. And so the entirety of the situation comes into
play. Why would you be inclined to doubt that I really had the
experience that I had? Is there some benefit to me lying? Does it seem
doubtful that I was asleep at the time I supposedly had the dream? Am
I the kind of person who often makes things up about things to get
stuff? Maybe the answer is you just don't know whether the statement
is true or not, but that's not the same thing as saying it isn't
meaningful. Religious experiences are different because 1.) not
everybody acknowledges that they have them 2.) they come in a wide
number of varieties and descriptions that tend to be in line with
prevailing cultural religious practices (by that I mean you rarely if
ever hear about a shinto priest seeing an apparition of the blessed
virgin) and 3.) sometimes the experience is so profound that it's
difficult to do much more than talk about physical and emotional
sensations, but those are descriptions of how the experience made me
feel, they aren't a description of what it was that made me feel that
way, of what the entity was that i encountered or whether it was an
entity at all. That's the part that I say can't be described. Clearly
there's something to it. Clearly it's an experience of a kind that
billions of people have experienced, but it's not open to either a
grammatical or empirical investigation in the same way other things
are, which is why it's very hard to say anything about God that has a
sense. But it can be pointed to, by my attitude and behavior, by my
description of how I felt in the religious encounter, by poetry and
music that recreates the feelings and gives it meaning of another kind
that has nothing to do with the meanings of the words or music in
itself but rather in the totality of how it reveals the experience of
the divine for others.

well, again it depends on what you think philosophy ought to be doing.
Perloff makes a good case that it is as much capable of philosophy as
symbolic logic. I tend to disagree not so much because I think poetry
is incapable of approaching the objects of philosophy, but largely
because I think philosophy does a generally pretty crappy job of
approaching its own objects and I'd rather not lower poetry to its
level.

Oh not at all though. I think there is a lot of truth out there in
things other than logic and reasoning, and most of it is much more
important than whether or not socrates really was a man or if all
swans are in fact white. but "truth value" as i use it is a technical
term that has to do specifically with propositions that can be
symbolized and reasoned about with various rules of inference. And the
sorts of sentences and expressions that have those other kinds of
truth are not about the kinds of things that propositions can talk
about, which are empirical and grammatical facts and whether or not
they obtain.

Yeah. The poor guy. I sometimes feel very alone in my reading of him.
Even though I know I'm right and that everybody else from Stanley
Cavell and Cora Diamond back to Rudolph Carnap completely
misunderstood what he was up to, whenever I talk to philosophically
inclined folks about him I always feel like I'm fighting an uphill
battle against all kinds of preconceived notions. Not to say that
that's the case here, so much. :) I sometimes think maybe a lot of
people just let Saul Kripke Richard Rorty and Hilary Putnam do their
reading for them without recognizing that all of them are using
Wittgenstein's ideas to their own ends, which are not the aims
Wittgenstein had at all.

> Once again, great conversation.

Indeed, thanks so much for the engaging thoughts.

To revise my very first post sent to poetics 11 years ago today:

Hello to all from David Kirschenbaum, editor of Boog City.

19 years ago today, we published the first two Boog chapbooks in =20
Albany, New York, and it's been a fun ride. To all out there who  =20
crossed my path along the way; influenced me/the press (one thing?); =20
contributed work to various publications; performed at the many =20
different events; collated, stapled and distributed; and opened their =20=

homes to me as though I were kin, thanks.

Since 1991, each year new works have been published that somewhere say =20=

Boog on 'em. For that, I thank
you all.

Special shout-outs to:

Katie Yates-for her advice and getting me to Naropa;

d.a levy-spirit guide;

Lawrence Ferlinghetti-for showing the way;

Ed Sanders-for his words of encouragement, constant feedback, and =20
contributions;

Lee Ann Brown-for her kindness and always giving me work at the asking;

Douglas Brinkley-for introducing me to Lou Reed and Naropa;

Jeffrey and Dorian Bergen, co-owners of ACA Galleries, who've provided =20=

their space, food, and beverages on the house so our levy lives series =20=

could celebrate over 100 small presses from across the U.S. and =20
Canada. (We begin season 8 in September.);

Rachel Aydt- Boog's first author, and one of the best poets-and =20
friends-around;

Rod Sperry- former cofounder, the most passionate co-editor a press =20
could've wanted;

Brenda Iijima-former art editor and kosher poems collaborator, and =20
warm and lengthy conversationalist;

Nathaniel Siegel-selfless beyond selfless, kind beyond kind;

Bob Holman and the Bowery Poetry Club and E. Tracy Grinnell and Litmus =20=

Press/Aufgabe, longterm advertisers and supports, without whom Boog =20
City would not have been able to spread the words on and by so many =20
talented writers, musicians, and artists;

My folks-for the use of their Jeep each issue distribution day and life;

The Sidewalk Caf=E9-home for so many Boog music events. Thanks Lach and =20=

Ben Krieger.

Jill Stengel-late night poetry (and life) conscience instant messenger;

Sean Cole-constant collaborator and acceptor of writing assignments;

Jesse Schoen-graphic designer to the stars;

Jim Behrle-king of distribution and unfiltered feedback;

Joanna Fuhrman-two-time poetry editor who isn't shy with the truth;

Jonathan Berger-oft times distributor, longest tenured editor, our =20
music editor, de facto managing editor, lieutenant, and friend; and

Ian Wilder-for taking me to my first poetry reading and editing =20
everything I've written for the past 23 years, and being my.

Thanks and Be Good,
David

similar experience when my calculus instructor proved the power rule

something truly beautiful that goes on in mathematics, and I don't

Who he?

> Someday I
hope to be able as an old man to return to this stuff and study non-
euclidean geometry and mathematical logic again, because you're
absolutely right that it is a wonderful and amazing thing. Where I
think I differ from you Godel Turing and Cantor is that I'm not
comfortable moving from there to making metaphysical or ontological
claims about things like numbers or geometrical shapes.

What metaphysical or ontological claims have I made that you would take
issue with?

I think there's much to recommend finitistic approaches philosophically.
However, if finitistic philosophies cannot produce formal systems that
generate the standard and very useful results of traditional mathematics,
results that are used in real-world applications, very often, then that
would seem to indicate that finitistic approaches do not go as far as they
need to
and *can without contradiction*. Assuming the existence of the actually
infinite seems to be required to give us a formal system with the full
generative capability required to generate the standard results that do seem
to be very useful in modelling situations in the world. Not to say that
'infinity goes on before our eyes'. But the analytical tools we can make to
help us with whatever it is that goes on before our eyes seem to require the
actually infinite to attain full generative capability.

This is different from, say, a green philosophy versus a black philosophy.
Green philosophies/ecologies of mind may not provide us with the sort of
economic growth associated with black philosophies, but they do allow us to
continue living on the planet, whereas black philosophies hasten the demise
of humanity and the planet as ecosystem.

There is no analogous moral and pragmatic issue involved in finitistic
versus actually infinite mathematical philosophies. Also, although
finitistic philosophies emphasize their seeming congruence with the
observable world (in which we never observe the actually infinite, only the
poetentially infinite), if finitistic philosophies cannot produce formal
systems that generate *all* the standard theorems of real analysis, then
that would seem to indicate either that the finitistic philosophies are a
bit wonky, not as strong as they should be, or that the standard results are
wonky. But it seems clear the latter isn't the case, since those standard
results are widely used in applied math in  modelling stuff in the world.

The 'fight' over the assumption of the existence of the actually infinite is
over. Assuming the existence of the actually infinite has its place in every
math department in the world and finitistic philosophies are not pursued
with the seriousness that Wittgenstein, Brouwer, and the rest
brought to the matter in a time when it was thought that such philosophies
might well give us formal systems that were both more congruent with the
observable world and also sufficiently rich and generative to be the
standard formal systems in the math world. That battle was presumably over
by the time Hilbert declared no one was gonna evict his ass or our ass from
Georg's transfinite paradise hotel for mathematicians (1926).

"Cantor's ideas ultimately were largely accepted, strongly supported by
David Hilbert, amongst others. Hilbert predicted: "No one will drive us from
the paradise which Cantor created for us" (Hilbert, 1926). To which
Wittgenstein replied "if one person can see it as a paradise of
mathematicians, why should not another see it as a joke?" "
from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy_over_Cantor%27s_theory

> To me, this
stuff is just magic (per my def. of magic here:
http://www.wetasphalt.com/content/magician-priest-conjurer-lawyer-law-mysticism-magic-and-occult)
  and there I think is probably Wittgenstein's biggest failing, in
that he didn't take his thoughts on magic far enough. Although he
rightly took Fraser to task for the Golden Bough interpretation of
shamanism, I think he didn't pursue the connection between magic, the
inneffable, and religious ritual to the end that I think his view of
language allows.

I read your essay. Well done. And I will remember not to play you cards for
money.

> As for truth tables, you're right, and provably so. Emil Post
developed them in the 1920s and can't have read the Tractatus, because
it was as yet unpublished and unknown in the US. I do think the
semantic theory of truth embodied in his invention of truth conditions
(Tractatus 4.4 and sub comments) is a significant contribution as
well, but even Wittgenstein might have debated that since he later
became something like a deflationist and his analysis of truth is one
of the things that I think one can firmly point to as a definite
example of the differences between early and later Wittgenstein. That
said, I think one goes a bit awry to think that Wittgenstein's import
for mathematics rests solely on his contributions to mathematical
logic. I think, for example, there's no diminishing of the beauty of
mathematics if one adopts his antiplatonism, and I think he makes
strong arguments that a platonic theory of number, for example, has to
answer. More importantly, I think he makes a strong connection between
mathematical meaning and mathematical application. Which is to say, I
think on a Wittgensteinian view, that the discovery that logarithms
were useful in the calculus and in chemistry gave new meaning to
logarithms that weren't there for the early inventors of logarithms
who had no knowledge of calculus, the physics of cosmology, or
scientific chemistry. They were primarily a short hand for dealing
with complex calculations involving ratios. I think this analysis as
finding new meaning for an old part of mathematics makes a lot more
sense of the human encounter with new mathematical applications than
does the platonic view that those mathematical entities already exist
in the world waiting to be discovered whether people come along or
not.

We talked earlier, Jason, about truth tables being obvious enough
that they would have been invented (and, as you say, were) by someone else
had Wittgenstein not done it. And we recognize that though it could have
taken considerably longer, given its outstanding brilliance, beauty, and
originality, so too would Godel's work have been done by someone else had
Godel not done it. Why? Because he was dealing with pressing problems that
many people were therefore working on. Even calculus, which is by no means
obvious and plain jane, was simultaneously created/discovered by Newton and
Leibniz. Because calculus is a tool that is very useful to solving the
pressing mathematical problems of the time in which Newton and Leibniz
lived. And because many people were therefore working on those problems. And
because, though the formulations of calculus  by Newton and Leibniz differed
in significant ways, the underlying strategy of limits was the same: the
notion of a limit of an infinite sequence. And why was it the same? Cuz
that's basically what yu gotta do to find, say, the tangent to an equation
that represents a curve. The pressing problems of the time needed calculus.
It was the logical tool to develop/create. And in that sense, it was
'discovered'. We develop and create. If others, working on the same
problems, end up developing and creating the same tools, it would seem that
we were, instead, 'discovering'. But there's only so many ways to do certain
things. Hammers were probly discovered all over the world. And some of the
underlying ideas implicit therein. Just like the Pythagorean theorem was
'discovered' in many cultures (for surveying) before the notion of proof
emerged. There are only so many useful moves at any point in the 'game'. In
a formal system/language game, only so many states are reachable from any
given state.

Is this a Platonic or a nominalist take on the matter or something else?

> In fact I think it makes things like logarithms or the number i
more beautiful and even poetic in the fact that new meanings were
found for them long after they were invented. I often wish he had
lived a few more decades and could have seen the digital computer,
because I wonder what he would have made of the work Turing/Godel/
Church et. al. were doing after seeing them given the meaning that
calculating machines were able to make out of them. I think he would
have thought it was a wonderful thing.

> And at the same time, I think, maybe, he might argue that some of the
awe that everybody who grasps things like incompleteness, transfinite
numbers, and decideability problems (which, interestingly, he had no
problem with. He thought that the halting problem was real and
incorporated some of Turings work on algorithms into his thoughts on
what mathematical meaning is) COULD be just the sort of giddiness one
feels as a result of semantic paradoxes that come about through the
syntactic manipulation that goes on in mathematics.

Sure, we're all idiots and can't tell profound ideas from the witless
pleasures of pushing symbols around.

> ALthough clearly
that's not the end of it, because the same thing happens like I said
for a proof of the power rule, or an elegant proof of the pythagorean
theorem, which both have a clear semantic meaning even in
wittgenstein's sense of mathematical meaning. More importantly, while
I'm not at all sure he's right, I think it is an interesting challenge
to Set Theory to show that an infinite set should be analyzed as a
rule for the unlimited extension of a series,

I don't know what that means but should add that I'm not really curious to
find out. I am more interested in your essay on magic than in Wittgenstein's
mathematical philosophy. I'm sure he's an interesting writer, but his
mathematical philosophy looks like a dead end to me. Since about 1926.

> much the way that a
calculation that presents an irrational number is a rule about how to
extend of the number to N+1 places, rather than an actual infinite
thing-in-itself. I'd be very curious if you knew of anything that
takes up that notion, because it's always struck me as very compelling
although philosophers I respect and who understand this stuff better
than me (and who are otherwise sympathetic to Wittgenstein's view of
mathematics, like Putnam and Fine) have remarked in passing that they
think he was wrong about how he analyzed the diagonal proof.

There are a couple of ways I'm aware of to think of irrational numbers.
First, of course, we define a rational number as one that can be represented
as A/B where A and B are integers and B is not 0. These are ratio-nal
numbers. Irrational numbers are any numbers that can't be so represented.

It's simple enough to show that root 2 is irrational. So they exist, these
numbers. We can represent root 2 as the length of the hypotenuse of a right
angle triangle with legs of length 1. A very 'observable' number. Observable
as the length of the hypotenuse of a simple triangle.

Another way to look at irrational numbers is their decimal expansion. It's
fairly easy to show that the decimal expansion of rational numbers may start
out willy nilly, but eventually there's a fixed block of digits that repeats
forever after. like 9.028263789789789789789... the 789 part repeats forever;
that's a rational number. Any number whose decimal expansion doesn't have
this property (whereby a block of digits eventually repeats forever) is an
irrational number.

One way to look at the set of real numbers is like this. Start with the
rational numbers. Now we make convergent sequences whose elements are
rational numbers. Some of those convergent sequences will converge to
rational numbers, some to irrational numbers. The set of real numbers can be
thought of as the closure of the set of limits of convergent rational
sequences. In other words, every irrational number can be thought of as the
limit of a convergent infinite sequence of rational numbers.

Irrational numbers are those numbers, together with the rational numbers,
that are required to form a linear continuum. The construction of the real
number system is towards a 'number line' of points that suffer no gaps.


> What matters to me though, particularly in the realm of how all of
this applies to poetry, is that I still think that semantic paradox is
a useful tool of poetry that is very good at pointing to things that
might otherwise not be able to be expressed by other more normal
means. I think, for example, that the liar paradox is an interesting
way to approach the notion of divinity, something I used in a poem I'm
very proud of that tries to express something about my experience of
the divine (published here if you're curious:
http://www.blazevox.org/061-jfq.pdf)

"philosophy ought to be written ... only as a form of poetry." ~Wittgenstein

that's how he wrote it, isn't it. i got that. though i wasn't aware of the
above quote.

i don't understand how it "expresses something about my experience of
the divine". what's up with that?

> . And I think that's useful in poetry, because I can't tell you what
it feels like to experience the divine in the same way that I can tell
you that cutting my finger while chopping onions is painful. But I can
try to create that feeling through poetry, and by talking in that sort
of way, using that kind of approach where meaning is both looser and
also more pointed, I think poetry can express the otherwise
inexpressable, and that too is a kind of magic.

It can hint at it. And be strong enough to give readers the opportunity to
create their own experience. i mean you can't express the inexpressable. or
it wouldn't be inexpressable. but the writing can engage people in the
creation of their own related experience and understanding.

> Finally, because I think you might enjoy it as it relates to
Wittgenstein's appreciation for Turing, I give you this remark from
the Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics:

> "What harm is done e.g. by saying that God knows all irrational
numbers?  Or: that they are already there, even though we only know
certain of them?  Why are these pictures not harmless?
For one thing, they hide certain problems.

> Suppose that people go on and on calculating the expansion of Ï€. So
God, who knows everything, knows whether they will have reached
â€˜777â€™ by the end of the world. But can his omniscience decide
whether they would have reached it after the end of the world?  It
cannot. I want to say: Even God can determine something mathematical
only by mathematics.  Even for him the mere rule of expansion cannot
decide anything that it does not decide for us.

> We might put it like this: if the rule for the expansion has been
given us, a calculation can tell us that there is a â€˜2â€™ at the
fifth place. Could God have known this, without the calculation,
purely from the rule of expansion?  I want to say: No."

I think there are things that God can't do. There are impossibilities. And,
if they're impossible, then they're also impossible for God. Can God make a
rock s/he/it can't lift? In either case, there's something God can't do.

> Cheers and thanks again for the opportunity to flex these particular
muscles. They do get rusty reading law books these days...

Well, next time I'm in Seattle, we'll have to get together. And if yer up in
Victoria, too.

(in my MS, the poems don't share pages)

any help is greatly appreciated!

Excerpt:
The flimsy history created by post-modernity contrives to impose an intimid=

 the ephemeral which, if not embraced, (and post-modernists do express cons=

utely. Many post-modern equations are simple: =E2=80=9Cincorporate or peris=
h=E2=80=9D is one. What, beyond creating an imposing veneer, constitutes po=
st-modern =E2=80=9Cincorporation=E2=80=9D? Nothing. Post-modernists, for wh=

Various times when there have been threads on this list that involve "spirituality" "soul" and suchlike, I have meant to ask if someone could offer a clarifying interpretation of the line "God's body's got a soul" from Jean Toomer's "Cotton Song", that wonderfully vigorous poem from _Cane_, which is not only a classic of both the Harlem Rennaisance and the Lost Generation, as wikipedia would have it, but also another stupendous 1923 prose/poetry amalgam, alsongise Williams' _Spring and All_.

The question, what in fact does it mean to declare "God's body's got a soul". For those who have a monotheistic God-concept, it's not debatable that God is Spirit, is it, whether or not one may also have a sense of God as body [as in the Charles Olson Maximus (Volume 3) poem beginning "I believe in God/as fully physical".] So what does it mean to make a full-throated proclamation that God has a Soul?

Or does "God's body" in the poem mean "the human body created by God".

The poem anyway delights and surprises me with its sense of the soul needing the body to set it in motion.


Cotton Song

Come, brother, come. Lets lift it;
come now, hewit! roll away!
Shackles fall upon the Judgment Day
But lets not wait for it.
God's body's got a soul,
Bodies like to roll the soul,
Cant blame God if we dont roll,
Come, brother, roll, roll!

Cotton bales are the fleecy way,
Weary sinner's bare feet trod,
Softly, softly to the throne of God,
"We aint agwine t wait until th Judgment Day!

Nassur; nassur,
Hump.
Eoho, eoho, roll away!
We aint agwine to wait until th Judgment Day!"

God's body's got a soul,
Bodies like to roll the soul,
Cant blame God if we dont roll,
Come, brother, roll, roll!

Absolutely fascinating, Murat. The implication would seem to be that  L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E  writing contains extremely strange sequences of words because that mirrors or fits appropriately alongside all the "meaninglessness" that's spoken or written everywhere, as per this way of thinking [Hmmm, Shelley's "Hail to thee, blithe Spirit" would be utterly meaningless, but the next line "bird thou never wirt" is at least a proposition]. Giving the reader an insight into meaninglessness via extreme meaninglessness could be a more achievable goal than the allegedly oppression-shattering liberation of people's minds by disrupting syntax that was spoken of so much, and anyway seems more in line with the "clowntown is over" ethos of Langpo.

Can you point me to any essays by lango writers in which this mimicking of nonsense is stated as a program?

a rodeo to an apple bob - this to most poetry comps -=20

http://www.nycmidnight.com/2010/FFC/challenge.htm

one thing i like about many u.s. poetry comps is that they have an aestheti=
c context -unlike australia where the pretence is almost always the best of=
 the best - it may be acknowledged that different judges have different tas=
tes but the blandout conventionalism of the basic premise is rarely challen=
ged

(wasnt going to raise this issue again but provoked by the above appearing =
on my facebook page with the usual suggestion that i 'like' it. i 'x'ed it=
=2C with the reason 'offensive'=2C but perhaps shdve clicked 'misleading')

John Wieners:  HELLO JOHN, from 2010

THE BRAND NEW John Wieners EPC page:  http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/wieners/

About a year and a half ago I complained to Jack Krick that there was
no Wieners EPC page, and he said, "WELL THEN DO ONE WITH ME!"  Jack
Krick is one of those people who has been working hard for years for
the love of poetry.  He's pretty amazing!  And he keeps the EPC pages
lively and alive, and recently enough gave us the tremendous BLACKBURN
page as well.  Whatever THANKS Jack is given it can't possibly be
enough!

So I read EVERYTHING by Wieners to take this opportunity seriously!
Interlibrary loan ordered all of his  books for me over a period of a
year.  It was fantastic, and I LOVE the librarians of the world!
THANK YOU LIBRARIANS OF THE WORLD!

And all those amazing poets in Boston for their invaluable assistance.
 Jim Dunn was particularly great!  As he always is!

Joey Yearous-Algozin and Robbie Dewhurst took me to the Special
Collections at Buffalo where we found the boradside by Judith Walker
with the Wieners photo and his poem HOME DUTY.  That was great, and I
thank everyone at Buffalo, including James Maynard for helping us
reprint it on this new EPC page.

AN AMAZING FIND -- by sheer accident -- was when I was browsing the
poetry section at the gay and lesbian library in Philadelphia and came
across a couple of issues of LITTLE CAESARS magazine from the 1970's,
published by Dennis Cooper.  One of these had a Stephen Jonas tribute
with an entry stating that the introduction to his 1965 collection
TRANSMUTATIONS was written by John Wieners.

The love and magic of interlibrary loan then made TRANSMUTATIONS
appear, and to my delight the introduction by Wieners was actually two
separate poems (the first written in 1959, the second in 1965).
Neither of these poems had ever been reprinted since this slender
volume of Jonas's poems with the Basil King drawings in 1965.  But
Jack Krick has lovingly reprinted them here.

IN THE END what we need of course is a COLLECTED JOHN WIENERS.  Right?
 Would anyone out there possibly disagree with me over this?

THANK YOU JACK KRICK, AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO HELPED MAKE THIS POSSIBLE!

LONG LIVE THE POETRY OF JOHN WIENERS!  AND I ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO
UTILIZE INTERLIBRARY LOAN UNTIL A FULL COLLECTION IS AVAILABLE!

Please pass this call for submissions on to women who might be
interested. Thank you for your support!

Bone Bouquet seeks to publish the best new writing by female poets,
from artists both established and emerging. We are especially
interested in work that is unpredictable, poems that have both sass
and authority.

We are looking for poetry, interviews, craft essays, and reviews of
chapbooks/books of poetry by women (please limit reviews to those that
address books published in the last two years).

We have added two fabulous assistant editors to our staff: Elizabeth
Brasher of New Mexico and Allison Layfield of California. These women
rock.

Simultaneous submissions are fine, as long as we are notified when
work is accepted elsewhere. Bone Bouquet only accepts previously
unpublished work; we request first electronic rights, and would like
to archive your work on the site. Please note that your work first
appeared in Bone Bouquet if it is reprinted elsewhere on the web or in
print. Submit up to five pages of poetry, up to twenty pages of
interview, poetics essay, or review, up to three .jpeg images of
original art. We look forward to reading your work, and are honored
that you trust us to read it.

For more information on our aesthetic, please read our first two
issues online, which feature work from Kate Schapira, Danielle
Pafunda, Susan Briante and many other amazing poets.

All best,

Krystal Languell

Touted as a minimalist epic, *Cartographies of Silence* comprises over one
hundred untitled poem fragments - what Vatne calls "unconscious
interruptions" - that navigate maps of being/non-being,
writing/speaking/thinking, to reveal the mind-body experience where silence
meets language. Robert Kelly writes, =93Short words, short lines, short poe=

Erik Vatne was born in New Jersey and holds degrees from Bard College and
Trinity College Dublin. He recently completed a training program in

=0A=0A=0ADear Friend,=0A =0AIt=E2=80=99s quite strange to realize it was on=
ly a year ago I sat hunkered down in my =0Asweaty apartment writing an emai=
l that seemed to blast right out of my head.=0A =0AIf you received this mis=
sive, you=E2=80=99ll know I=E2=80=99d spent the evening folding a LOT of =
=0Alaundry  =E2=80=93 an endless chore made worse by the fact I was not onl=
y =0Afolding my laundry, but also that of my 8 month old daughter (any pare=
nt will =0Aattest that the act of sorting a mountain of brightly patterned =
shirts, socks =0Aand pajamas is in itself a certain hell). After projecting=
 myself into the =0Amindset of the narrator of Tillie Olsen=E2=80=99s semin=
al short story =E2=80=9CI Stand Here =0AIroning,=E2=80=9D I allowed myself =
a couple glasses of wine. This, I believe, was a key =0Afactor in my commit=
ting the most grievous of email sins.=0A =0AFor not only did I send my emai=
l to numerous people=E2=80=94 worse, I concluded my =0Amissive with a most =
lamentable statement: =E2=80=9CFeel free to forward this to anyone =0Aand e=
veryone you think might be interested.=E2=80=9D=0A =0AThis email, titled: =
=E2=80=9CAs I Stood Folding Laundry: Women=E2=80=99s Writing Now,=E2=80=9D =
was =0Aspurred by my disgruntlement over the fact an AWP proposal I=E2=80=
=99d =0Asubmitted--addressing a rhetorical means of dissent in contemporary=
 American =0Awomen=E2=80=99s poetry--had been rejected. In my email I worri=
ed aloud about whether =0Athis panel had been dismissed because of its dist=
inctly feminist overtones, =0Awhile also noting certain trends I=E2=80=99d =
observed in the literary world: =0Aspecifically how male literary achieveme=
nts are so often deemed more important =0Athan those of women with regard t=
o publication, criticism, reviews, awards, etc.=0A =0AWhile this disparity =
had long seemed obvious to me, I=E2=80=99d never before had the =0Anerve to=
 speak to it openly.=0A =0AMy email went on to describe my fantasy of creat=
ing an association that would =0Aserve to unite women writers, across genre=
s, aesthetics, ethnicities and =0Agenerations.  Indeed, in the simple act o=
f conceiving such an organization=E2=80=99s =0Apotential, I got so fired up=
 that evening it seemed to me perfectly reasonable =0Athat I send my though=
ts to every female writer I knew.=0A =0AThe following morning my in-box was=
 full.=0A =0AIn less than twelve hours, I=E2=80=99d already received numero=
us replies=E2=80=94some from =0Afemale poets I considered so awe-inspiringl=
y important I was stunned to see =0Atheir names appear on my computer=E2=80=
=99s screen; others from women writers I=E2=80=99d never =0Amet, who wrote =
compelling accounts of their own frustrations, each one =0Aexpressing a des=
ire to create a national forum for the very issues my email had =0Aaddresse=
d.=0A =0AI was awed by the response. But I was also afraid. Because I recog=
nized that I=E2=80=99d =0Aunwittingly taken on a responsibility to remain t=
rue to all that I=E2=80=99d written =0Aonly the night before. I realized I =
would not only need to acknowledge the =0Aimmediate support with which my p=
roposal had been received, but that I must also =0Aembrace it.=0AI discover=
ed that it was due to the poet Erin Belieu=E2=80=99s initiative that my ema=
il =0Areached the astonishing number of people it did. It was she who sent =
my email to =0Asome forty established female poets, who then sent it on to =
the female writers =0Athey knew. It was due to Erin=E2=80=99s initial enthu=
siasm that my email went, as they =0Asay, viral, ending up on blogs, listse=
rvs and in newspapers throughout the =0Acountry=0A =0ASo it only seemed fai=
r to turn to the culprit who had so thoroughly disseminated =0Amy thoughts.=
 I didn=E2=80=99t in fact know Erin Belieu well personally, but I knew she =
=0Ahad a reputation for gumption and guts, something this fantasy organizat=
ion was =0Agoing to need to get off the ground.=0A =0AOne short phone call =
later and I now had a co-director. It was that day that =0AErin and I co-fo=
unded the organization that began as WILLA, and has now =0Atransformed into=
 a different name--VIDA: Women in Literary Arts.=0A =0A[To create a more di=
stinct identity and preempt possible legal issues, WILLA =E2=80=A8is now VI=
DA.  We are confident that we've already begun to grow into our new =E2=80=
=A8name and feel that "VIDA" better reflects the vitality of our organizati=
on.]=0A =0ASo I write to you a year later from a poorly air-conditioned roo=
m while =0Asuffering the advances of a particularly persistent mosquito. I =
still have =0Alaundry that needs sorting. However, I can say that my life a=
s a female writer =0Abeen not only been invigorated, but deeply altered, in=
 the best sense of the =0Aword, by the email I almost regretted sending a y=
ear ago.=0A =0AVIDA=E2=80=99s had a great first year. A few of many highlig=
hts include our mention in =0Athe New York Times for calling outPublisher=
=E2=80=99s Weekly =E2=80=9CTop Ten Best Books of =0A2009,=E2=80=9D and thei=
r egregiously =E2=80=9Cfemale-free=E2=80=9D list. VIDA also hosted a number=
 of =0Areadings and conversations, including our AWP Evening of Burlesque, =
Roller Derby =0AAnd Literature, which turned out to be just as thought prov=
oking and fun as we=E2=80=99d =0Awanted our debut to be. We=E2=80=99ve rece=
ntly been asked by AWP to be a sponsor of next =0Ayear=E2=80=99s conference=
 in Washington DC and are busily scheming to make our follow up =0Ajust as =
memorable.=0A =0AThere are many more things under way for VIDA this year: w=
e have a spiffy new =0Awebsite and blog (www.vidaweb.org) with articles and=
 features you=E2=80=99ll want to =0Acheck out as well as a new Facebook pag=
e where you can find out about VIDA =0Aevents and join the thousands of peo=
ple there who=E2=80=99ve entered into our =0Aconversation. We=E2=80=99re al=
so moving along in planning a national conference for =0Athose who want to =
support and know more about literature written by women. It=E2=80=99s =0Ahe=
avy-lifting, but we=E2=80=99re devoted to making this enormous and financia=

Your love affair with categories and search for edifying "upward" feelings =
lead you to say some truly stupid things in your essay.

Post-modernity's "lack of real engagement with history" etc.

I find it interesting how well you resist or miss what the poetic interest =
in Marxist theory has been.

Written like a true capitalist.

Don't be jealous.

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CDoom Cusp=E2=80=9D by David =
Meltzer
Description:
"Doom Cusp" by David Meltzer is dedicated to the California artist Wallace =
Berman who was one of Meltzer's mentors when he became exiled there from Br=
ooklyn. Berman's use of the Hebrew alphabet and especially the Aleph in his=
 collages, reminded Meltzer of the presences of the Holocaust and seemed re=
levant today in the midst of another series of Holy Wars and their ultimate=
 futility.

your advice is making it more manageable!

Ummm . . . :

"a total" ("a"=singular)
"is" (singular)
"This place is a total wreck."

"totals" (plural)
"are" (plural)
"Several totals are required to ensure accuracy."

The newest proposal for national educational standards
in the U. S. recommends teaching grammatical agreement
in grade three (the first grammatical principle mentioned
in that set of standards). Many of my students in college
composition seem unable to distinguish between one and
more than one. Perhaps only a tiny neurological window
exists for hard-wiring agreement, but given recent work
in brain plasticity, I doubt it--though a fourteen-week
semester usually proves insufficient for rehab. As Yale
grad G. W. Bush wondered, "Is our children learning?"
Good enough? Enjoy that?

Maria, Tenney, and everyone else, thanks.

Great news is that there is a COLLECTED WIENERS in the works!

How exciting is THAT????

But until then I strongly suggest interlibrary loan is the way to go,
unless you can actually afford the prices the thieves trying to cash
in on the Wieners legacy by jacking up his out of print stock.

It's a great day knowing Wieners will be BACK IN PRINT!

Total is singular. "There are ten books," but "there is a total of ten=

MacAllister wrote "Crowning the May Queen," one of four shorter works that
comprise "The Waiting Room" (a production of Green Light Arts).  The piece
stars Kelly DeVose and TS Hawkins.  "Crowning the May Queen" is deeply
rooted in MacAllister's time in Ethiopia on a 2009 Fulbright-Hays.  "The
Waiting Room" features other short works by local Philadelphia women
playwrights including Deborah Leigh Scott, Gabrielle Corsaro, and Vivian
Appler.

Charlie Chan: A Stereotype and a HeroBy CHARLES McGRATHPublished: August 10=

Enlarge This Image<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/books/11chan.html?_r=
=3D1&ref=3Dtodayspaper>To
many Asian-Americans, Charlie Chan is an offensive stereotype, another sort
of Uncle Tom. Chan, the hero of six detective novels by Earl Derr Biggers
and 47 Hollywood movies between 1926 and 1949, not to mention a 1970s
Hanna-Barbera cartoon series <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068037/>, is
pudgy, slant-eyed and inscrutable, and he speaks in singsong fortune-cookie
English, saying things like, =93If befriend donkey, expect to be kicked.=94=
 The
California-born author and playwright Frank
Chin<http://chintalks.blogspot.com/>,
who has written essays denouncing Chan, would like to see him disappear
altogether.

Yunte Huang has written an absorbing history of the legendary Charlie Chan.=
More
Photos =BB <http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/08/10/books/11chan-ss.htm=
l>

But Yunte Huang, who was born and grew up in China, can=92t get enough of C=
han
and has written a book about his obsession: =93Charlie Chan: The Untold Sto=
ry
of the Honorable Detective and His Rendezvous With American History.=94 The
book, which comes out from Norton next week, is part memoir, part history,
part cultural-studies essay and part grab bag of odd and little-known
details.

Biggers, who overlapped at Harvard with T. S.
Eliot<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/e/t_s_elio=
t/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>
but
did not exactly share his literary taste, said he got the idea for Chan
while sitting in the New York Public
Library<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n=
/new_york_public_library/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-org>
in
1924 and reading about a real-life Honolulu detective named Chang Apana. Mr=
.
Huang suggests that Biggers may have misremembered the details, but there i=
s
no doubt that Apana was the model for Chan, and Mr. Huang gives a full
account of a life that was in many ways more interesting than the fictional
version: born in Hawaii to Chinese parents, Apana moved to China and then
back to Hawaii, where despite being virtually illiterate, he rose in the
detective ranks of the Honolulu police. He wore a cowboy hat, carried a
bullwhip and was said to leap from rooftop to rooftop like a human fly.

Mr. Huang gives an equally full account of Chan=92s movie
history<http://charliechanfamily.tripod.com/> and
of the actor with whom he was most memorably associated: a Swede named
Warner Oland, who played a Jew in the first talkie, =93The Jazz Singer,=94 =
and
then, because he had vaguely Asian features, made a specialty of Oriental
villains. (The original Chan, George Kuwa, was Japanese.) Oland was a heavy
drinker, Mr. Huang writes, and liked to take a nip before slipping into the
Chan persona: it slowed down his speech and put a congenial, Chan-like grin
on his face. In 1938, after Oland had boozed himself to a premature death
and was replaced by an American named Sidney Toler, movie producers
encouraged him to try the same trick.

But the most interesting story in =93Charlie Chan=94 is Mr. Huang=92s own. =
=93I have
an alphabetic destiny,=94 he said, laughing, over lunch in Chinatown last
week. In the late 1980s he had been a student at Beijing University and,
after the protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989, where he would have been on
the day tanks opened fire if his parents hadn=92t lured him home on a false
pretense, he determined to leave China. He got hold of a guidebook to
American colleges, and =93Alabama starts with A,=94 he pointed out. =93I wa=
s
pretty desperate to get out of the country and the University of
Alabama<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u=
/university_of_alabama/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-org>
was
the first school I looked up.=94 He added that when he got there, =93Tuscal=
oosa
was another planet,=94 and went on: =93Nobody walked in the street. Everyth=
ing
was so slow, so clean and so empty.=94

When he got sick of the South, Mr. Huang said, he decided to go to Buffalo
for a Ph.D. in English literature. He felt, he writes in =93Charlie Chan,=
=94
=93like a bottom-feeding fish, one that cannot see the light of day in the
muddy pond of America.=94

But why Buffalo? =93Buffalo begins with B,=94 he said, grinning. He worked =
as a
delivery boy there, but happily gave up the restaurant business. =93Graduat=
e
school is really easy compared to restaurant work,=94 he pointed out.

At an estate sale he bought a couple of Biggers=92s novels and was immediat=
ely
hooked. He began renting all the Chan movies he could find.

Mr. Huang, who is 41, divorced and the father of a young daughter, speaks
nearly perfect, idiomatic English. He learned the language, he said, from
listening to Voice of
America<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/v=
/voice_of_america/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-org>broadcasts
with his family and also from going to church in Tuscaloosa. =93On Sunday
morning I=92d stand on the corner carrying a Bible,=94 he explained, =93and=
 people
would stop and ask what church I was going to. =91Yours,=92 I=92d say. I sa=
w a lot
of churches that way.=94

After Buffalo he spent four years teaching literature at Harvard, in
Cambridge, Mass., before taking a job at the University of California, Sant=
a
Barbara<http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organization=
s/u/university_of_california/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-org>,
and next year he has a fellowship at
Cornell<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c=
/cornell_university/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-org>.
=93I=92m kind of stuck in the C=92s right now,=94 he said, =93and I can=92t=
 really move
on. =93Charlie Chan =97 that=92s a double C.=94

Chan was an obsession he pursued for years, he said, while trying to write =
a
memoir called =93The Yellow Alabaman=94 until a friend encouraged him to pu=
t
that book aside and write instead about the detective. It was the aphorisms=
,
the fortune-cookie
sayings<http://www.reellifewisdom.com/the_top_10_wise_quotes_from_charlie_c=
han>,
that first attracted him, and then he became interested in the way Chan is =
a
projection of American fears and American imaginings about China =97 an
embodiment, as he writes in the book, of =93both the racist heritage and th=
e
creative genius=94 of his adopted nation=92s culture.

Over lunch he said: =93I grew up watching Chinese opera, where you have som=
e
of that same exaggeration, and growing up in that literary culture was very
useful for understanding cultural ventriloquism and the whole idea of
crossing over. It was fascinating to see how Chan was a sort of =91yellowfa=
ce=92
performance.=94 He added that in the 30s the Charlie Chan movies were
immensely popular in China, of all places, where they were seen as an
antidote to the sinister caricature of the Fu Manchu films, but that
attitudes had changed. Not long ago he was discussing with a Chinese
publisher the possibility of translating =93Charlie Chan=94 himself and bri=
nging
it out in China. The publisher listened politely and said, =93Right now we=
=92re
actually more interested in Fu Manchu.=94

Oh, let's be poetic and LISTEN to the grammar. Consider, for instance,
this sensitive passage from Randolph Quirk, Sidney Greenbaum, Geoffrey
Leach, and Jan Svartvik, _A Comprehensive Grammar of the English
Language_ (London: Longman, 1985):

"The _there_ of existential sentences . . . often determines concord,
governing a singular form of the verb even when the following 'notional
subject' is plural:

_There's_ some people in the waiting room. <informal>

occurs alongside:

_There are_ some people in the waiting room."

(Chapter 18.46, "The status of existential _there_ as subject," p. 1405)

The two sentences about people in the waiting room communicate slightly
different senses of the word "there," don't they? Training yourself to
hear the difference is one of the many things that poetry is good for.

So here's an exercise. Can you listen to this example from ch. 18.49, p.
1408, "There exist a number of similar medieval crosses in different
parts of the country," and then articulate an explanation of why "There
exists a number" would be computer language, not human language?

I just have to say I'm ashamed of this country, and scared - too much
hatred against illegal immigrants (WHICH WE ALL ARE), and now Islam. Some
of the protests are all too familiar Kristallnacht in tone - on Jon
Stewart, there was a newsclip of a community going to burn a copy of the
Koran on 9/11.

I can't argue this with anyone - I'm horrified and brought to tears by it.
And we can't sit by and let a rabid racist right grow in this country -
the affects have been seen repeatedly worldwide.

Abstract
We present an exploratory study of forest-living orangutan pantomiming, i.e.
gesturing in which they act out their meaning, focusing on its occurrence,
communicative functions, and complexities. Studies show that captive great apes
may elaborate messages if communication fails, and isolated reports suggest
that great apes occasionally pantomime. We predicted forest-living orangutans
would pantomime spontaneously to communicate, especially to elaborate after
communication failures. Mining existing databases on free-ranging rehabilitant
orangutans' behaviour identified 18 salient pantomimes. These pantomimes most
often functioned as elaborations of failed requests, but also as deceptions and
declaratives. Complexities identified include multimodality, re-enactments of
past events and several features of language (productivity, compositionality,
systematicity). These findings confirm that free-ranging rehabilitant
orangutans pantomime and use pantomime to elaborate on their mess
ages. Further, they use pantomime for multiple functions and create complex
pantomimes that can express propositionally structured content. Thus, orangutan
pantomime serves as a medium for communication, not a particular function.
Mining cases of complex great ape communication originally reported in
functional terms may then yield more evidence of pantomime.

The Rise of America's Idiot Culture  The Muslim Community Center at
Ground Zero: a Manufactured Controversy
By ANTHONY DiMAGGIO

A substantial racist uproar is taking place in conservative America,
particularly in right-wing radio and television.  Reactionary pundits
are drawing increased attention to plans to build an Islamic community
center in downtown Manhattan, near Ground Zero.  Republicans and
conservatives have long been known to harbor racist views of Islam,
although they're hardly alone in this.   Many on the right frame the
entire religion as radical, fundamentalist, and a threat to national
security.  In light of this pattern, there's little surprising about
the right's most recent attack on Muslim Americans as a secret,
under the radar threat.

Islam has at times been portrayed on the right as the bedrock threat to
American cultural values, and Muslims are depicted as uni-dimensionally
set on overthrowing Christianity, enslaving the American public, and
imposing "Sharia law."  The last warning about "Sharia
law" ? repeated by pundits like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh
? among many others ? comes off as extremely ignorant,
considering that the term "Sharia" itself means Islamic law.
One should take the warnings of those who use the phrase "Sharia
law" about as seriously as someone who masquerades as a legal
scholar while talking about the importance of "American law
law."

The American right has also taken to paranoid conspiracy theories
charging that Obama is a non-citizen.  As the story goes, Obama was
really born in Kenya, and his "take over" of the White House
represents a secret victory for radical Islam, since, as we all
"know," Obama is a closet Muslim terrorist who is allied with
Osama bin Laden and other radical Islamists.  About half of Republicans
believe either that Obama is not a citizen or that they cannot be sure
of whether he is really an American citizen or not.  These views are
shared by nearly 60 percent of self-designated Tea Party supporters.

Of course, the nuances of the Islamic faith and the mainstream nature of
the American Muslim community - the vast majority who oppose terrorism,
fundamentalism, or repression of women - have been completely lost in
the smug arrogance and incompetence of racists on the right.

The reactionary right has long been opposed to anything related to Arab
culture and the Muslim religion in New York and around the country.  One
infamous example is New York's Khalil Gibran Arabic language
academy, the first of its kind for the city.  Rabid right-wingers railed
against it, especially those in the "stop the Madrassa" campaign
(many of whom worried about the dangers of "Madrassa schools,"
while apparently too ignorant to realize that the word Madrassa itself
means school).  I argued with one of the leaders of this group on Alan
Colmes' radio show a few years ago.  She seemed un-phased by the
reality that there was never any concrete evidence that the Khalil
Gibran academy was teaching Islamic values.  As she announced on the
show (despite my scorn for her comments), the very fact that there was
no visible evidence of an Islamic curriculum was proof of just how good
the schools' administrators and teachers were of hiding it.  Such
paranoia demonstrated how far conservative extremism and racism have
come in recent years.

This brings us to the most recent "controversy" related to
Islam: the Muslim community center planned for Manhattan.  Right wingers
in radio and at Fox News have gone into overdrive attacking it as a
fundamental threat to the American way of life and to American security.
Their racist diatribes have been hard for me to listen to, but they
remain important to address, if for no other reason than so we can fight
the ignorant assumptions behind them head on.

Here's a quick review of some of the most outrageous comments made
in the American media:

- On Fox News, former Congressman Newt Gingrich attacked the community
center for its planned location "right at the edge of a place where,
let's be clear, thousands of Americans were killed in an attack by
radical Islamists."  On his website, Gingrich announced that
"there should be no mosque near ground zero in New York so long as
there are no churches or synagogues in Saudi Arabia."
Gingrich's choice to spotlight the radical fundamentalist regime of
Saudi Arabia (hypocritically supported by Gingrich himself when he was
Speaker of the House in the 1990s) ? while neglecting moderate and
secular governments in the Muslim world, speaks volumes about what he
considers to be the "essence" of Islam.  Gingrich's language
is truly abhorrent; he frames those supporting the community center in
Manhattan as part of the same "they" as the Islamic
fundamentalists who perpetrated the 9-11 attacks.  As far as Gingrich is
concerned, there are no distinctions to be made in the monolithic
"threat" that is the entire U.S. and world Muslim community.

- On Fox, Sarah Palin drew attention to "those innocent victims,
those families of those who were killed in the 9-11 tragedy, it saddens
me to think that people don't understand what building this mosque
at such hallowed ground really represents."  Inextricably linked to
Palin's warnings is the assumption that the community center
represents a single, overarching fifth column threat from American
Muslims.   This much was clear when she characterized its construction
as "an unnecessary provocation" against the people of New York
and the American people more generally.

- Fox News host Sean Hannity claimed that the "Iman" supporting
the building of the community center is a figure who "supports what
happened on 9/11" and "praises Osama bin Laden."  Hannity,
of course, failed to present any evidence linking community center
supporters to defending the 9/11 attacks, but this hardly seemed to
matter to him or his guest, Jay Seculow (of the American Center for Law
and Justice), who complained that "you don't get to build a
mosque on a site that's part of ground zero" because "that
would be like putting at Pearl Harbor a monument of the Kamikaze pilots
who tried to destroy U.S. troops, you just don't do that."  In
this case, Muslim Americans who had nothing to do with 9/11 are
apparently the equivalent of Japanese soldiers who killed Americans
during World War II.

- Right wing radio icon Rush Limbaugh, not to be outdone, warned that
"the terrorists win" if the community center successfully moves
forward.  Limbaugh continued, posing a hypothetical comparing Muslim
Americans to those who lynched blacks in the post Civil War era:
"Let me ask you: What would happen, do you think, if the Ku Klux
Klan wanted to establish a memorial at Gettysburg?"  Limbaugh also
employed a World War II analogy, likening the dangers of the community
center to the destruction brought upon Japan by U.S. nuclear weapons:
"Let's go to Hiroshima and Nagasaki and let's build giant
monuments in the shape of nuclear bombs and call it the Manhattan
Project.  I mean you'd have Americans objecting to that,
wouldn't you?"

What is most disturbing about the manufactured controversy involving the
community center is the blatant arrogance and stupidity of the right in
its warnings of an imminent "threat."  Anyone who spends thirty
seconds researching the Cordoba Group, the organization responsible for
promoting the community center, would know that the group's
representative, Feisal Abdul Rauf (targeted in Hannity attacks as
pro-bin Laden and pro-9/11) is actually a public critic of Osama bin
Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and a vocal supporter of improving relations
between the U.S. and the Muslim world.  None of this is conveyed in any
of the right-wing slander above, however, as these pundits are content
to showcase their ignorance regarding the basic facts surrounding the
community center fiasco they "authoritatively" "report"
on.

I should note that all of the pundits above premise their attacks on the
Manhattan community center with statements that promotion of religious
tolerance and cultural diversity are important and necessary.  These
claims, however, mean nothing when they are followed by fear mongering
and attacks on Muslims as part of an all-encompassing threat that
derives from some sort of uniform "Muslim culture" ? one
that is seen as constituting a danger to U.S. security and the American
way of life.  These pundits refuse to distinguish between the tiny
minority of those throughout the world who support terrorism in the name
of Islam and the vast majority of Muslims who reject those beliefs.
Their reluctance to take a reasonable, level-headed approach to the
study of the Muslim faith is an indicator of their fanaticism, religious
bigotry, and racism.

Rather than asking whether the Manhattan community center represents a
threat, we should be asking ourselves what happened to our country when
national discourse is hijacked by those who not only have no interest in
facts, but see them as an active roadblock to advancing their racist
agendas.  The blatant racism and incompetence of those attacking the
Manhattan community center should be obvious enough to those who pride
themselves in promoting multi-culturalism, racial diversity, and respect
for religious freedom.  That the racist right remains so prominent in
national television and radio is a sign, more than anything else, of the
steep deterioration of American political discourse.

5. 8 Percent of U.S. Births to Illegal Immigrants

     Study: 8 Percent of U.S. Births to Illegal Immigrants


       Pew Hispanic Center Report Sheds Light on Americans at Center of
       Birthright Citizenship Debate


         By DEVIN DWYER

*WASHINGTON, August 11, 2010---*

Eight percent of all babies born in the U.S. in 2008 belonged to illegal
immigrant
<http://newspreview.corp.dig.com/Politics/illegal-immigration-america-shadows-abc-news-special-series/story?id=11099873>
parents, according to a groundbreaking analysis of U.S. Census Bureau
data by the Pew Hispanic Center. Under the 14th amendment to the
Constitution, each child obtained U.S. citizenship at birth while one or
both of the parents remained undocumented.

The study <http://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php?ReportID=125> sheds
new light on a group of Americans at the center of a hot political
debate
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/birthright-citizenship-14th-amendment-republican-senators-explore-change/story?id=11313973>
in recent weeks. Some Republican lawmakers have proposed revising
birthright citizenship to bar U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants
from obtaining legal status.

Pew estimates 340,000 of the 4.3 million newborns in U.S. hospitals in
2008 belonged to illegal immigrant parents. In total, 4 million
U.S.-born, citizen children of illegal immigrants
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/birth-tourism-industry-markets-us-citizenship-abroad/story?id=10359956>
currently live in the country, according to the study.

The study is the most comprehensive, non-partisan research to date on
children of illegal immigrants living in the U.S. and adds important
context, and frames the ongoing debate. Previously there have been few
reliable estimates of annual U.S. births to illegal immigrants.

Critics of birthright citizenship
<http://abcnews.go.com/WN/debate-birthright-citizenship-aims-baby-tourism/story?id=11322850&page=1>
have expressed concern over the burgeoning size of America's illegal
immigrant
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/illegal-immigration-america-shadows-abc-news-special-series/story?id=11099873>
population, estimated at 10.8 million and whose offspring in the U.S.
would be able to sponsor their parents and relatives for legal
residency. The children are sometimes referred to as anchor babies.

"Birthright citizenship I think is a mistake," said Republican Sen.
Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. "We should change our Constitution and
say if you come here illegally and you have a child, that child's
automatically not a citizen."

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other leading Republicans,
including Arizona senators Jon Kyl and John McCain, have indicated an
openness to exploring the 14th Amendment issue raised by Sen. Graham.
But some harbor deep reservations about changing the Constitution.

"It's a rather unseemly business and I think we ought to have some
hearings about it," McConnell said of the practice of illegal immigrant
mothers giving birth in the U.S.

"Congressional hearings are always warranted when members of Congress
raise the issue of amending our Constitution," said McCain in a
statement. "I believe that the Constitution is a strong, complete and
carefully crafted document that has successfully governed our nation for
centuries and any proposal to amend the Constitution should receive
extensive and thoughtful consideration."


       Birthright Citizenship Debate: Election Year Politics?

But some lawmakers are calling the push to revise the 14th Amendment
nothing but a political stunt.

"I think it's good to take a look at all of our constitutional
amendments. But I'll tell you something: if you think it's a coincidence
that this sudden discussion begins three months before an election,
you'd be very, very mistaken," said Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie
Sanders on ABC's "Top Line"
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/sanders-14th-amendment-100-percent-political-11314073>.


Pennsylvannia Democratic Sen. Arlen Specter, whose parents were
immigrants to the U.S., has called U.S. citizenship by birth a
fundamental right.

"The political pandering on the immigration issue has reached the
hysterical level," Specter told ABC News. "To try to direct the effort
at the children born in this country is just preposterous... How can
newborn children protect themselves if politicians want to gain
political gain... I would be shocked if this idea would gain political
traction, but I'm being shocked on a daily basis by the United States
Senate."


         History of Birthright and the 14th Amendment

The 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which was enacted after the
Civil War to grant citizenship to descendants of slaves, reads: "All
persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state
wherein they reside."

"The drafter of the 14th Amendment provision on citizenship did make a
statement that it would not include foreigners or aliens," said George
Washington University constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley.
"However, other senators made it clear that they believed that this
provision guaranteed birthright citizenship."

The courts have repeatedly ruled that people who are born in the U.S.
are American citizens and if Congress passed a law changing that, it
would likely be repealed, experts say.

The Supreme Court <http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Supreme_Court/> has
only addressed the issue once, clarifying in 1898 that citizenship does
apply to U.S.-born children of legal immigrants who have yet to become
citizens.

"The legislative history may be a little mixed, but the language of the
amendment seems to speak clearly in favor of birthright citizenship,
regardless of what the intent may have been," Turley said.

The United States is one of the few remaining countries to grant
citizenship to all children born on its soil. The United Kingdom,
Ireland, India and Australia, among others, have since revised their
birthright laws, no longer allowing every child born on their soil to
get citizenship.

Oh, let's be poetic and LISTEN to the grammar. Consider, for instance, this=
 sensitive passage from Randolph Quirk, Sidney Greenbaum, Geoffrey Leach, a=
nd Jan Svartvik, _A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language_ (London:=
 Longman, 1985):

"The _there_ of existential sentences . . . often determines concord, gover=
ning a singular form of the verb even when the following 'notional subject'=
 is plural:

_There's_ some people in the waiting room. <informal>

occurs alongside:

_There are_ some people in the waiting room."

(Chapter 18.46, "The status of existential _there_ as subject," p. 1405)

The two sentences about people in the waiting room communicate slightly dif=
ferent senses of the word "there," don't they? Training yourself to hear th=
e difference is one of the many things that poetry is good for.

So here's an exercise. Can you listen to this example from ch. 18.49, p. 14=
08, "There exist a number of similar medieval crosses in different parts of=
 the country," and then articulate an explanation of why "There exists a nu=
mber" would be computer language, not human language?

Been talking with my Green Party D.C. friends.
It really does seem as if the End has finally arrived and will be unfolding in
many interesting ways as the 1st decade of century 21 comes to a close.

I mean, even the Rich are no longer getting richer.
It's that bad.
& the enviroment, as everyone knows, is a cesspool.

So I'm wondering: Where are the sustainable communities?
Artist, especially, should think very hard.

I haven't done the research, but I wonder if there's a Native American Tribe
that has an Adopt a Gringo program. I've been rereading my Wendell Berry and I'm
almost certain (I'm not good with absolutes) that the original natives of this
country will have a huge leg up when things finally collapse.Run ... to the
woods ... or someplace safe.

You must be totaled to be accurate.  Is that like being 98.6% loaded?

Dear friends / colleagues,

I am forwarding a call from Chris Cuellar, a Chicago-based artist working
within conceptual and digital poetics (and recent grad of our MFA Writing
program). Feel free to contact him and please pass along to other artists,
friends, students, etc. in your communities who might be interested.

very best to all
Judd

Subject: Fwd: Call for Participants | Listeners Project @ Hyde Park Art
Center

Below is an official call for participants for a current project for the
fall. I know that all of you have many, many interesting contacts both far
and wide, and would be extremely grateful if you could forward to any
potentially interested parties. Please note that this call is for remote
performances (meaning they can happen almost anywhere, though time zone
differences are always pesky).

*****************************




LISTENERS PROJECT 2010

Call for Participants

In conjunction with the Hyde Park Art Center's Ground Floor exhibition, The
Listeners is a sound project that uses audio streaming technologies to
investigate the increasingly ubiquitous phenomenon of telepresence, a form
of liveness often associated with notions of network culture or ambient
awareness.

The project space within the gallery consists of two primary elements: a
recording station and a listening station. Ambient sound from the recording
station will be streamed over the internet to a performer in a remote
location, who will simply listen to the incoming audio stream. The
performer's directive is to listen and verbally describe everything that he
or she is hearing, while also streaming this verbal description back to the
gallery in real-time. The recording station inside the gallery will be fully
accessible to viewers, who, intentionally or not, will contribute audio
content to the outgoing stream. The listening station, however, will only be
accessible to a single viewer at a time, via one pair of headphones placed
in a close enough proximity to the recording station, where the viewer will
be able to listen to the performer's incoming verbal description of the
nearby sonic environment.

The material requirements necessary to perform this piece are minimal: a
computer, a microphone (most computers now have these built-in) and a steady
internet connection. All performers will receive step-by-step setup
instructions; no special technical experience is required.

The show will run from August 29 - October 31, 2010; with a listening
performance running from 1pm-5pm, once per day, seven days a week. I would
like to have enough performers enlisted such that all participants would
perform no more than two times. If you are interested in participating:
please contact me at chris.israel.cuellar@gmail.com

what is of value?

my mom passed away two years ago. i'm living in the house i inherited from
my parents. forty years of stuff in the house. have to get rid of a lot of
stuff.

she liked her china. it was of great value to her. but it isn't worth much
anymore. cuz you can't put it in the dishwasher or the microwave oven. so
young people don't want it very badly. and her mink coat. that was of great
value to her. but nobody wants them anymore cuz they're beacons of
barbarism. and the books. can barely give them away, around here.

she also placed value on proper grammar. to be able to speak properly and
write properly. that too is changing, the value of such things. the idea of
such things. not because of george bush, so much, as the international
dimensions of contemporary communications and also the lack of intense
concentration on grammar as a high priority in education. many of us
correspond and/or speak regularly with people whose first language is not
english. if they are generous enough to speak english with us, do we really
want to demand 'proper english' from them? particularly if we cannot speak
their language? i don't think so. we have more important things to deal
with.

I couldn't agree more about the morbidity of the mosque debates Alan
and by the statement that we are all immigrants

i do not however think it is the sole purview of the "right" to
generate paranoia and hate speech (bearing in mind that "left" and
"right" are also troubling formulations with troubled histories)

i've not seen Obama want to take down the fence with Mexico started
under the odious Bush in the south west (for example . . . he sent
more troops no less) nor actually close down Guantanamo (for
example . . . all empty rhetoric for 18 months already now) nor do
anything but escalate the war in Afghanistan (for example . . .
although i guess that's not surprising since Democrat presidents have
taken the US to war far more eagerly and frequently throughout the
twentieth century than even their Republican counterparts . . .
unless my math is just wrong, in the guise of the world's
police . . . vomit) nor repeal the Patriot Act (for example . . . an
act of insanity by GW Bush against which there was so much derision
focussed when i first came to live here in the US and which Obama has
re-ratified) nor address the hideous Department of Homeland
Security  . . . ( a militarization of the State that builds
inexorably on surveillance and controls brought in my that arch Big
Brother sap J Edgar Hoover . . .)

  . . .


and then which judge made a serious move on Prop 8 just a couple of
weeks ago . . . a libertarian-leaning freedom of speech judge
appointed by Ronald Reagan . . (what is Obama doing to end Reagan's
appallingly debilitating and outright destructive War on Drugs?? btw)


attacks on the "right" by the "left" appear just as driven by
paranoia and characterized by stereotypical terms and forms of abuse
as attacks on the "left" by the "right"

it is as often unions who campaign against immigration on the grounds
of competition for their members jobs and a previous wave of
immigrants which tries to block the next as it is nationalists and
xenophobes weaving their racist sentiments into planning and zoning
debates and whipping up fearful sentiment


a pox on both Democrats and on Republicans

Dear Cris & Alan:

Thank you both for your letters.

The direction of the usa has been terrifying for decades now.
For many years i have been working on various studies, research, readings,
and expressing in writings, art work, letters, my conviction that one of the
major symptoms of this direction has been the shifting use/abuse/misuse and
deliberate abuse of the language; to quote Pasolini: "for a long time, the
only symptoms we had to go one were in the language."

In Torture:  The Cancer of Democracy France-Algeria 1954-1962 Phllipe
Vidal-Naquet raises the question of how the use of Torture affects and
poisons a Wstern Democracy:  the same effects one may find in the USA since
both knowledge & acceptance of Torture and the support of an Apartheid State
became part of the everyday language and consciousness.  Language of denial,
language of double speak, rebrandings, Orwellian Newspeak as detailed in the
appendix to 1984--a language and culture of ridicule initiated during the
Reagan regime--the lack of questioning and critique, the growing sense of
paranoia of both a State and corporate culture of Security, Surveillance, of
the removal of more and more protections for any individual charged and even
not charged with no longer criminal actions, but, increasingly, "intents,"
which may soon become "thoughts," --in broad daylight, almost day by day,
freedoms being removed, the powers of the Executive Branch being extended
without control--so that now the president can pick any person in the world
and order their extra-judicial execution--the ridicule and critique of any
form of Protest, whether in public or in writing, art--by artists and poets,
critics and intellectuals--particpating in censorship and self-censorship--
all have generated a culture which is ever more immune to the uses of
cruelty towards "Others" ranging from words to torture to ethnic cleansing
and genocide--

everyday reading, listening, watching the news and what passes for "public
discourse" one is presented with a non-stop stream of dis-information,
distortions, denials, deliberate ignorance, bigotry, bullying--

and all too often, any form of holding to account is greeted with campaigns
designed to silence and subvert the concept of justice, questioning,
inquiry, let alone its expression, calls for these in action--

all too often, the most monstrous events, persons, politics, are shrugged
off with the most bland cliches:  "oh, but they're/he/she is such a nice
person(s)-- --etc--

sadly, from the President on down, there is an increasing tolerance for
intolerance--a goading towards acts of extreme violence and retaliations--at
the personal level, and already paraded by the expansion of the US military
presence, torture centers, "Black Op" and and other covert operations
globally--by supporting torture and Apartheid elsewhere, the American
citizen is opening the way to accepting these "at home"--detention camps for
"illegal aliens" and the immense explosion in the US (increasingly
privatized and more open to abuses) prison population--largest both
numerically and by per centage of the population in the world--all point
towards an embrace of other and ever harsher measures to be meted out to
anyone and everyone--charged with or even with the remote possibility of
being charged with--just about any "crime" any person with even minor
"authority" dreams up in a fever of "patriotism"--

as Cris points out, it is not from the "right" only that such language has
emerged, but across the society--and in every area of society and culture--

>> Abstract
>> We present an exploratory study of forest-living orangutan pantomiming,
>> i.e.
>> gesturing in which they act out their meaning, focusing on its occurrence,
>> communicative functions, and complexities. Studies show that captive great
>> apes
>> may elaborate messages if communication fails, and isolated reports
>> suggest
>> that great apes occasionally pantomime. We predicted forest-living
>> orangutans
>> would pantomime spontaneously to communicate, especially to elaborate
>> after
>> communication failures. Mining existing databases on free-ranging
>> rehabilitant
>> orangutans' behaviour identified 18 salient pantomimes. These pantomimes
>> most
>> often functioned as elaborations of failed requests, but also as
>> deceptions and
>> declaratives. Complexities identified include multimodality, re-enactments
>> of
>> past events and several features of language (productivity,
>> compositionality,
>> systematicity). These findings confirm that free-ranging rehabilitant
>> orangutans pantomime and use pantomime to elaborate on their mess
>> ages. Further, they use pantomime for multiple functions and create
>> complex
>> pantomimes that can express propositionally structured content. Thus,
>> orangutan
>> pantomime serves as a medium for communication, not a particular function.
>> Mining cases of complex great ape communication originally reported in
>> functional terms may then yield more evidence of pantomime.

>> The Rise of America's Idiot Culture  The Muslim Community Center at
>> Ground Zero: a Manufactured Controversy
>> By ANTHONY DiMAGGIO
>>
>> A substantial racist uproar is taking place in conservative America,
>> particularly in right-wing radio and television.  Reactionary pundits
>> are drawing increased attention to plans to build an Islamic community
>> center in downtown Manhattan, near Ground Zero.  Republicans and
>> conservatives have long been known to harbor racist views of Islam,
>> although they're hardly alone in this.   Many on the right frame the
>> entire religion as radical, fundamentalist, and a threat to national
>> security.  In light of this pattern, there's little surprising about
>> the right's most recent attack on Muslim Americans as a secret,
>> under the radar threat.
>>
>> Islam has at times been portrayed on the right as the bedrock threat to
>> American cultural values, and Muslims are depicted as uni-dimensionally
>> set on overthrowing Christianity, enslaving the American public, and
>> imposing "Sharia law."  The last warning about "Sharia
>> law" ? repeated by pundits like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh
>> ? among many others ? comes off as extremely ignorant,
>> considering that the term "Sharia" itself means Islamic law.
>> One should take the warnings of those who use the phrase "Sharia
>> law" about as seriously as someone who masquerades as a legal
>> scholar while talking about the importance of "American law
>> law."
>>
>> The American right has also taken to paranoid conspiracy theories
>> charging that Obama is a non-citizen.  As the story goes, Obama was
>> really born in Kenya, and his "take over" of the White House
>> represents a secret victory for radical Islam, since, as we all
>> "know," Obama is a closet Muslim terrorist who is allied with
>> Osama bin Laden and other radical Islamists.  About half of Republicans
>> believe either that Obama is not a citizen or that they cannot be sure
>> of whether he is really an American citizen or not.  These views are
>> shared by nearly 60 percent of self-designated Tea Party supporters.
>>
>> Of course, the nuances of the Islamic faith and the mainstream nature of
>> the American Muslim community - the vast majority who oppose terrorism,
>> fundamentalism, or repression of women - have been completely lost in
>> the smug arrogance and incompetence of racists on the right.
>>
>> The reactionary right has long been opposed to anything related to Arab
>> culture and the Muslim religion in New York and around the country.  One
>> infamous example is New York's Khalil Gibran Arabic language
>> academy, the first of its kind for the city.  Rabid right-wingers railed
>> against it, especially those in the "stop the Madrassa" campaign
>> (many of whom worried about the dangers of "Madrassa schools,"
>> while apparently too ignorant to realize that the word Madrassa itself
>> means school).  I argued with one of the leaders of this group on Alan
>> Colmes' radio show a few years ago.  She seemed un-phased by the
>> reality that there was never any concrete evidence that the Khalil
>> Gibran academy was teaching Islamic values.  As she announced on the
>> show (despite my scorn for her comments), the very fact that there was
>> no visible evidence of an Islamic curriculum was proof of just how good
>> the schools' administrators and teachers were of hiding it.  Such
>> paranoia demonstrated how far conservative extremism and racism have
>> come in recent years.
>>
>> This brings us to the most recent "controversy" related to
>> Islam: the Muslim community center planned for Manhattan.  Right wingers
>> in radio and at Fox News have gone into overdrive attacking it as a
>> fundamental threat to the American way of life and to American security.
>> Their racist diatribes have been hard for me to listen to, but they
>> remain important to address, if for no other reason than so we can fight
>> the ignorant assumptions behind them head on.
>>
>> Here's a quick review of some of the most outrageous comments made
>> in the American media:
>>
>> - On Fox News, former Congressman Newt Gingrich attacked the community
>> center for its planned location "right at the edge of a place where,
>> let's be clear, thousands of Americans were killed in an attack by
>> radical Islamists."  On his website, Gingrich announced that
>> "there should be no mosque near ground zero in New York so long as
>> there are no churches or synagogues in Saudi Arabia."
>> Gingrich's choice to spotlight the radical fundamentalist regime of
>> Saudi Arabia (hypocritically supported by Gingrich himself when he was
>> Speaker of the House in the 1990s) ? while neglecting moderate and
>> secular governments in the Muslim world, speaks volumes about what he
>> considers to be the "essence" of Islam.  Gingrich's language
>> is truly abhorrent; he frames those supporting the community center in
>> Manhattan as part of the same "they" as the Islamic
>> fundamentalists who perpetrated the 9-11 attacks.  As far as Gingrich is
>> concerned, there are no distinctions to be made in the monolithic
>> "threat" that is the entire U.S. and world Muslim community.
>>
>> - On Fox, Sarah Palin drew attention to "those innocent victims,
>> those families of those who were killed in the 9-11 tragedy, it saddens
>> me to think that people don't understand what building this mosque
>> at such hallowed ground really represents."  Inextricably linked to
>> Palin's warnings is the assumption that the community center
>> represents a single, overarching fifth column threat from American
>> Muslims.   This much was clear when she characterized its construction
>> as "an unnecessary provocation" against the people of New York
>> and the American people more generally.
>>
>> - Fox News host Sean Hannity claimed that the "Iman" supporting
>> the building of the community center is a figure who "supports what
>> happened on 9/11" and "praises Osama bin Laden."  Hannity,
>> of course, failed to present any evidence linking community center
>> supporters to defending the 9/11 attacks, but this hardly seemed to
>> matter to him or his guest, Jay Seculow (of the American Center for Law
>> and Justice), who complained that "you don't get to build a
>> mosque on a site that's part of ground zero" because "that
>> would be like putting at Pearl Harbor a monument of the Kamikaze pilots
>> who tried to destroy U.S. troops, you just don't do that."  In
>> this case, Muslim Americans who had nothing to do with 9/11 are
>> apparently the equivalent of Japanese soldiers who killed Americans
>> during World War II.
>>
>> - Right wing radio icon Rush Limbaugh, not to be outdone, warned that
>> "the terrorists win" if the community center successfully moves
>> forward.  Limbaugh continued, posing a hypothetical comparing Muslim
>> Americans to those who lynched blacks in the post Civil War era:
>> "Let me ask you: What would happen, do you think, if the Ku Klux
>> Klan wanted to establish a memorial at Gettysburg?"  Limbaugh also
>> employed a World War II analogy, likening the dangers of the community
>> center to the destruction brought upon Japan by U.S. nuclear weapons:
>> "Let's go to Hiroshima and Nagasaki and let's build giant
>> monuments in the shape of nuclear bombs and call it the Manhattan
>> Project.  I mean you'd have Americans objecting to that,
>> wouldn't you?"
>>
>> What is most disturbing about the manufactured controversy involving the
>> community center is the blatant arrogance and stupidity of the right in
>> its warnings of an imminent "threat."  Anyone who spends thirty
>> seconds researching the Cordoba Group, the organization responsible for
>> promoting the community center, would know that the group's
>> representative, Feisal Abdul Rauf (targeted in Hannity attacks as
>> pro-bin Laden and pro-9/11) is actually a public critic of Osama bin
>> Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and a vocal supporter of improving relations
>> between the U.S. and the Muslim world.  None of this is conveyed in any
>> of the right-wing slander above, however, as these pundits are content
>> to showcase their ignorance regarding the basic facts surrounding the
>> community center fiasco they "authoritatively" "report"
>> on.
>>
>> I should note that all of the pundits above premise their attacks on the
>> Manhattan community center with statements that promotion of religious
>> tolerance and cultural diversity are important and necessary.  These
>> claims, however, mean nothing when they are followed by fear mongering
>> and attacks on Muslims as part of an all-encompassing threat that
>> derives from some sort of uniform "Muslim culture" ? one
>> that is seen as constituting a danger to U.S. security and the American
>> way of life.  These pundits refuse to distinguish between the tiny
>> minority of those throughout the world who support terrorism in the name
>> of Islam and the vast majority of Muslims who reject those beliefs.
>> Their reluctance to take a reasonable, level-headed approach to the
>> study of the Muslim faith is an indicator of their fanaticism, religious
>> bigotry, and racism.
>>
>> Rather than asking whether the Manhattan community center represents a
>> threat, we should be asking ourselves what happened to our country when
>> national discourse is hijacked by those who not only have no interest in
>> facts, but see them as an active roadblock to advancing their racist
>> agendas.  The blatant racism and incompetence of those attacking the
>> Manhattan community center should be obvious enough to those who pride
>> themselves in promoting multi-culturalism, racial diversity, and respect
>> for religious freedom.  That the racist right remains so prominent in
>> national television and radio is a sign, more than anything else, of the
>> steep deterioration of American political discourse.

The Parable of the Anvil and Garter
After a painting by Carrie Ann Baade
=20
I waited all night by the window for you,
hero, you and your white steed,
but you never arrived.
I would have mounted even a black horse
had you ridden up on purity=92s dark seed=96
any horse in a storm, brute muscle and sweat
saving me from lightning, hail, electricity gone wrong.
Meanwhile, the dishes piled up, dinner scorched
in the womb of the oven missing its controls
and the children straggled in with a rusty anvil
recovered from the neighbor=92s garbage.
Without the steady hoof beat of rescue
to march by, flying seems the only option.
Outside, in an absurd reversal of strength,
a single raven flees a host of sparrows
giant predator diving and swerving
to avoid the sting of lesser beaks.
Leaving the house in blue garter and bustier
proves much easier than explaining why I am astride
a gleaming metal weight, why the very burden meant to drag
me down is allowing me to soar above the mossy rooftop.
Every parable has a moral. Draw conclusions at your own risk.=

Right. The total appears (singular)  at the bottom of the page,
and may prove accurate if added by a tee-totaller.

Total... In the sentence, "This place is a total wreck," isn't "total"
actually a modifier? and the singular noun "a wreck?"

Notice how the British say "The government are in session," when Americans
say "The government is in session."

I like Jim Andrews' poignant tale of the house full of 40 years of
acculturation. It makes me think of my own 40+ years of teaching French.
There are some things I am learning to adjust and adjust to. For one, I'm
getting over my annoyance at the French borrowings of English. Why would
they say "le listing" when they have a perfectly good "la liste?" For
another, they tend to say "c'est" even when it is followed by a plural
complement.

New technologies can sometimes support good practices. Like some French
correspondents, I almost gave up using accents in my emails, because the
keystrokes are so tedious; now with iPad it is a one-touch event to slide
your finger to the selected accented letter.

In my teaching, where students hadï»¿ accused me of making them into French
proofreaders, I am learning to refrain from interrupting to correct errors
if they are communicating successfully. The point in a restaurant in France
is to get fed, not to demonstrate impeccable grammar. Of course accuracy and
fluent expression nourish in another way.....

That said, we probably agree that it is valuable to know what the accurate
standard of a language is, in order to appreciate deviation from it.
N'est-ce pas?

Not just this country. On a listserv whose members don't pay much of
their professional attention to language, I called attention to an
anti-mosque blog by the New Republic's Marty Peretz, who attempted to
score a point for innuendo by referring to President Obama as "Barack
Hussein Obama." Back came an offlist reply from a Canadian who compared
me to both the Daily Worker (the old Communist Party USA newspaper) and
Joseph Goebbels.

In the same sentence too.

Greenbaum's office was across the hall from mine at UW-M.  He was a nice
guy who pestered the hell out of me about how exactly would I say
certain expressions concerning baseball.  He was simply a shadow in my
doorway and now he's a shadow on the Buf. list. and a famous one at
that.  Jess of Japan

Subject:      American Book Award for Poems for the Millennium
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

In advance of an official announcement, this is to report that Poems for =
the Millennium, volume 3: The University of California Book of Romantic =
and Postromantic Poetry, edited by myself and Jeffrey Robinson, will =
receive a 2010 American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation.  =
It's my understanding that there will be fourteen such awards over all, =
including Amiri Baraka's The Afro-American Soul of American Classical =
Music and Dave Eggers' non-fiction narrative Zeitoun, both previously =
announced, as well as a lifetime achievement award for our old =
comrade-in-poetry Quincy Troupe.=20

The nominating statement for Poems for the Millennium reads as follows:

 "Modernism rejected Romanticism in the way that one political leader =
rejects another-not because it is any different but because it wishes to =
win the same audience. This book demonstrates that the only thing that =
happened in Modernism was that a door opened onto still another aspect =
of the immense cultural experiment that Romanticism was-or as Rothenberg =
and Robinson might insist, as Romanticisms were (are). Central issues =
were what Rousseau called conscience de soi, self-awareness (but a =
self-awareness which deliberately did not separate itself from 'world'), =
a new interest in ethnicity and the local, and a shift from thinking of =
poetry as a 'craft' and of the poet as 'maker,' to thinking of it as a =
provoker of consciousness-even a creator of consciousness-and of the =
poet as Bard, Shaman. To know the work so carefully, lovingly and =
brilliantly assembled in this book is to know ourselves in a new and =
newly conscious way."

An awards ceremony and reception will take place on Sunday, September =

hi jared

i like your tone

id like to consider different tones as a way of nutting out something

political tones leave me cold

many radio tones grate

close readings of voice (close listening - bernstein) get blocked by listen=
ers horror at words spoken

we complain about whats being done to language but not the ultimately conte=
mptuous tones used to voice it

id like to see a debate or an interview where a key word or discourse is fo=
cused on but in relation to (contesting) the (habitual) tone being used

q: "can you talk like a human being?" "maybe try talking about something un=
related to politics first"

>>Abstract
>>We present an exploratory study of forest-living orangutan
>>pantomiming, i.e.
>>gesturing in which they act out their meaning, focusing on its
>>occurrence,
>>communicative functions, and complexities. Studies show that
>>captive great apes
>>may elaborate messages if communication fails, and isolated reports
>>suggest
>>that great apes occasionally pantomime. We predicted forest-living
>>orangutans
>>would pantomime spontaneously to communicate, especially to
>>elaborate after
>>communication failures. Mining existing databases on free-ranging
>>rehabilitant
>>orangutans' behaviour identified 18 salient pantomimes. These
>>pantomimes most
>>often functioned as elaborations of failed requests, but also as
>>deceptions and
>>declaratives. Complexities identified include=20
>>multimodality, re- enactments of
>>past events and several features of language (productivity,
>>compositionality,
>>systematicity). These findings confirm that free-ranging rehabilitant
>>orangutans pantomime and use pantomime to elaborate on their mess
>>ages. Further, they use pantomime for multiple functions and create
>>complex
>>pantomimes that can express propositionally structured content.
>>Thus, orangutan
>>pantomime serves as a medium for communication, not a particular
>>function.
>>Mining cases of complex great ape communication originally reported in
>>functional terms may then yield more evidence of pantomime.

>>The Rise of America's Idiot Culture  The Muslim Community Center at
>>Ground Zero: a Manufactured Controversy
>>By ANTHONY DiMAGGIO
>>
>>A substantial racist uproar is taking place in conservative America,
>>particularly in right-wing radio and television.  Reactionary pundits
>>are drawing increased attention to plans to build an Islamic community
>>center in downtown Manhattan, near Ground Zero.  Republicans and
>>conservatives have long been known to harbor racist views of Islam,
>>although they're hardly alone in this.   Many on the right frame the
>>entire religion as radical, fundamentalist, and a threat to national
>>security.  In light of this pattern, there's little surprising about
>>the right's most recent attack on Muslim Americans as a secret,
>>under the radar threat.
>>
>>Islam has at times been portrayed on the right as the bedrock
>>threat to
>>American cultural values, and Muslims are depicted as uni- dimensionally
>>set on overthrowing Christianity, enslaving the American public, and
>>imposing "Sharia law."  The last warning about "Sharia
>>law" ? repeated by pundits like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh
>>? among many others ? comes off as extremely ignorant,
>>considering that the term "Sharia" itself means Islamic law.
>>One should take the warnings of those who use the phrase "Sharia
>>law" about as seriously as someone who masquerades as a legal
>>scholar while talking about the importance of "American law
>>law."
>>
>>The American right has also taken to paranoid conspiracy theories
>>charging that Obama is a non-citizen.  As the story goes, Obama was
>>really born in Kenya, and his "take over" of the White House
>>represents a secret victory for radical Islam, since, as we all
>>"know," Obama is a closet Muslim terrorist who is allied with
>>Osama bin Laden and other radical Islamists.  About half of
>>Republicans
>>believe either that Obama is not a citizen or that they cannot be sure
>>of whether he is really an American citizen or not.  These views are
>>shared by nearly 60 percent of self-designated Tea Party supporters.
>>
>>Of course, the nuances of the Islamic faith and the mainstream
>>nature of
>>the American Muslim community - the vast majority who oppose
>>terrorism,
>>fundamentalism, or repression of women - have been completely lost in
>>the smug arrogance and incompetence of racists on the right.
>>
>>The reactionary right has long been opposed to anything related to
>>Arab
>>culture and the Muslim religion in New York and around the
>>country.  One
>>infamous example is New York's Khalil Gibran Arabic language
>>academy, the first of its kind for the city.  Rabid right-wingers
>>railed
>>against it, especially those in the "stop the Madrassa" campaign
>>(many of whom worried about the dangers of "Madrassa schools,"
>>while apparently too ignorant to realize that the word Madrassa itself
>>means school).  I argued with one of the leaders of this group on Alan
>>Colmes' radio show a few years ago.  She seemed un-phased by the
>>reality that there was never any concrete evidence that the Khalil
>>Gibran academy was teaching Islamic values.  As she announced on the
>>show (despite my scorn for her comments), the very fact that there was
>>no visible evidence of an Islamic curriculum was proof of just how
>>good
>>the schools' administrators and teachers were of hiding it.  Such
>>paranoia demonstrated how far conservative extremism and racism have
>>come in recent years.
>>
>>This brings us to the most recent "controversy" related to
>>Islam: the Muslim community center planned for Manhattan.  Right
>>wingers
>>in radio and at Fox News have gone into overdrive attacking it as a
>>fundamental threat to the American way of life and to American
>>security.
>>Their racist diatribes have been hard for me to listen to, but they
>>remain important to address, if for no other reason than so we can
>>fight
>>the ignorant assumptions behind them head on.
>>
>>Here's a quick review of some of the most outrageous comments made
>>in the American media:
>>
>>- On Fox News, former Congressman Newt Gingrich attacked the community
>>center for its planned location "right at the edge of a place where,
>>let's be clear, thousands of Americans were killed in an attack by
>>radical Islamists."  On his website, Gingrich announced that
>>"there should be no mosque near ground zero in New York so long as
>>there are no churches or synagogues in Saudi Arabia."
>>Gingrich's choice to spotlight the radical fundamentalist regime of
>>Saudi Arabia (hypocritically supported by Gingrich himself when he was
>>Speaker of the House in the 1990s) ? while neglecting moderate and
>>secular governments in the Muslim world, speaks volumes about what he
>>considers to be the "essence" of Islam.  Gingrich's language
>>is truly abhorrent; he frames those supporting the community center in
>>Manhattan as part of the same "they" as the Islamic
>>fundamentalists who perpetrated the 9-11 attacks.  As far as
>>Gingrich is
>>concerned, there are no distinctions to be made in the monolithic
>>"threat" that is the entire U.S. and world Muslim community.
>>
>>- On Fox, Sarah Palin drew attention to "those innocent victims,
>>those families of those who were killed in the 9-11 tragedy, it
>>saddens
>>me to think that people don't understand what building this mosque
>>at such hallowed ground really represents."  Inextricably linked to
>>Palin's warnings is the assumption that the community center
>>represents a single, overarching fifth column threat from American
>>Muslims.   This much was clear when she characterized its construction
>>as "an unnecessary provocation" against the people of New York
>>and the American people more generally.
>>
>>- Fox News host Sean Hannity claimed that the "Iman" supporting
>>the building of the community center is a figure who "supports what
>>happened on 9/11" and "praises Osama bin Laden."  Hannity,
>>of course, failed to present any evidence linking community center
>>supporters to defending the 9/11 attacks, but this hardly seemed to
>>matter to him or his guest, Jay Seculow (of the American Center for
>>Law
>>and Justice), who complained that "you don't get to build a
>>mosque on a site that's part of ground zero" because "that
>>would be like putting at Pearl Harbor a monument of the Kamikaze
>>pilots
>>who tried to destroy U.S. troops, you just don't do that."  In
>>this case, Muslim Americans who had nothing to do with 9/11 are
>>apparently the equivalent of Japanese soldiers who killed Americans
>>during World War II.
>>
>>- Right wing radio icon Rush Limbaugh, not to be outdone, warned that
>>"the terrorists win" if the community center successfully moves
>>forward.  Limbaugh continued, posing a hypothetical comparing Muslim
>>Americans to those who lynched blacks in the post Civil War era:
>>"Let me ask you: What would happen, do you think, if the Ku Klux
>>Klan wanted to establish a memorial at Gettysburg?"  Limbaugh also
>>employed a World War II analogy, likening the dangers of the community
>>center to the destruction brought upon Japan by U.S. nuclear weapons:
>>"Let's go to Hiroshima and Nagasaki and let's build giant
>>monuments in the shape of nuclear bombs and call it the Manhattan
>>Project.  I mean you'd have Americans objecting to that,
>>wouldn't you?"
>>
>>What is most disturbing about the manufactured controversy
>>involving the
>>community center is the blatant arrogance and stupidity of the
>>right in
>>its warnings of an imminent "threat."  Anyone who spends thirty
>>seconds researching the Cordoba Group, the organization responsible
>>for
>>promoting the community center, would know that the group's
>>representative, Feisal Abdul Rauf (targeted in Hannity attacks as
>>pro-bin Laden and pro-9/11) is actually a public critic of Osama bin
>>Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and a vocal supporter of improving
>>relations
>>between the U.S. and the Muslim world.  None of this is conveyed in
>>any
>>of the right-wing slander above, however, as these pundits are content
>>to showcase their ignorance regarding the basic facts surrounding the
>>community center fiasco they "authoritatively" "report"
>>on.
>>
>>I should note that all of the pundits above premise their attacks
>>on the
>>Manhattan community center with statements that promotion of religious
>>tolerance and cultural diversity are important and necessary.  These
>>claims, however, mean nothing when they are followed by fear mongering
>>and attacks on Muslims as part of an all-encompassing threat that
>>derives from some sort of uniform "Muslim culture" ? one
>>that is seen as constituting a danger to U.S. security and the
>>American
>>way of life.  These pundits refuse to distinguish between the tiny
>>minority of those throughout the world who support terrorism in the
>>name
>>of Islam and the vast majority of Muslims who reject those beliefs.
>>Their reluctance to take a reasonable, level-headed approach to the
>>study of the Muslim faith is an indicator of their fanaticism,
>>religious
>>bigotry, and racism.
>>
>>Rather than asking whether the Manhattan community center represents a
>>threat, we should be asking ourselves what happened to our country
>>when
>>national discourse is hijacked by those who not only have no
>>interest in
>>facts, but see them as an active roadblock to advancing their racist
>>agendas.  The blatant racism and incompetence of those attacking the
>>Manhattan community center should be obvious enough to those who pride
>>themselves in promoting multi-culturalism, racial diversity, and
>>respect
>>for religious freedom.  That the racist right remains so prominent in
>>national television and radio is a sign, more than anything else,
>>of the
>>steep deterioration of American political discourse.

This is fantastic, Jerome. You know I had hoped to review the book, having
worked it when a student did an independent study with me, but I haven't

One Writes Potatoe, Another Writes Pota{h}to
OR, The Argument Need not be Souring


There now is a list-mate named Bowering,
Who might think that the others are cowering;
Though the offense be slight,
If the usage ain't right,
He'll rim-shot a scorn that is towering.

Michael=2C and Tyrone=2C

I appreciate it.  But I don't understand the question.  Truly.  Tyrone you =
did not ask a question.  So Michael.  Is there some thing I do=2C something=
 wonderful it must be=2C that isn't political?  Economic?  I'll anticipate =
your answer=2C at the risk of being wrong=2C and argue=2C that's the purpos=
e of trying an angle.  i think emily dickinson said that.  and that's how m=
osquitoes win.  Only after they're there are you free to swat them.  I also=
 remember something from Foucault somewhere=2C on a Facebook post (serious)=
=2C when asked why he must always make everything political.  His response=
=2C which I'm butchering=2C involved something about caring for that which =
of the greatest consequence for the greatest number.



The reason I respond in this way is because I=92m not all that
singular=2C and because this is a public forum.=20
I believe in these things like the poem but not like the poetry of the
poem=2C it=92s not ideal like that=2C but I do believe that someone sits do=
wn to all
kinds of pages and may return transformed.=20
Or not transformed.  Or
transformed by degrees with all kinds of transformations.  These if at all =
are mostly incremental.  What lasting import.  But what does permanent tran=
sformation
require.  I think I read that on a
listserv.  That=92s the difference even if
a little beside the point between popular and literary literatures=3B the o=
ne
returns you equipped differently.  So what does that mean.  Do I
recycle?  Yes=3B but it=92s piling up rather
quickly as I=92m rather lazy in these things which I don=92t throw away.  A=
m I still vegan?  I was but my wife=92s a chef=2C and I couldn=92t be so lu=
cky.  And I like my share in neighbor cow.  Do I clean up the dog on the wa=
lk
like I should?  Mow the grass?  (cf. lazy.)=20
I take these responsibilities very seriously=2C and I don=92t need to
convince anyone that worlds are ending.=20


=20

But the question was=2C what about entering this contest when
you=92ve opened your big trap on the matter contrarily. =20

I don't know if that addresses your question because I don't understand the=
 question. =20



But I'll bet if we were face to face and allowed to smoke our talk and thou=
ghts would be unrecognizable.  I read about that recently on a listserv too=
. =20

Sincerely=2C

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9COld Women Look Like This=E2=
=80=9D by Susan M. Schultz.
Description:=20
Inspired by a series of paintings by Elizabeth Berdann, "Old Women Look Lik=
e This" by Susan M. Schultz is about very old age. Schultz tests the compar=
ison of old age to childhood by placing old people into unexpected narrativ=
es, including children's stories, among them "Pippi Longstocking" and "Diar=
y of a Wimpy Kid". An imaginative off-shoot of her "Dementia Blog" (Singing=
 Horse, 2008).

Mair=E9ad,

Interesting, this way Romantic poetry becomes an integral part of
contemporary/modern poetry, which I thought it always was, particularly on
the German side.

Ciao,

Dear list,

Snide attacks such as the limerick below are pathetic. Aren't all
members on this list free to make comments of the sort George Bowering
made? Or are some members more equal than others?

I am unsubscribing from this list.

I've been told that comments in Chinese to weblogs are "spam." I have
deleted  a few of those comments. Then I realized that they may not be spam but
may be  legitimate comments. I have begun to translate 14 of them using
Babelfish. They  seem to be wisdom sayings, such as this one: "The success may
attract the  friend, frustrates may test the friend." I'd like information --
if anyone has  experience -- about issues in Chinese blogging, including
censorship.

No new poems this time, but here's my very first one to be published. It ap=
peared in ByLine, November, 1990:

MAKING A SUBMISSION

Change the typewriter ribbon, put more paper
=A0=A0=A0 in the copier,
Agonize over a cover letter
=A0=A0=A0 (Written on your last sheet of good stationery)
Seal the envelop and re-open it
=A0=A0=A0 to insert the forgotten S.A.S.E.,
Rush to the post office and stand on line,
=A0=A0=A0 waiting anxiously to
Give up your latest offspring.

Go back home, wondering
=A0=A0=A0 if the piece will be accepted, soon to
Appear in slightly altered form,
=A0=A0=A0 like your grown-up child
Encountered unexpectedly on the street;
=A0=A0=A0 or will it return,
Battered and travel-weary,
=A0=A0=A0 like a baby bird=0A temporarily
Sent out of its cage
=A0=A0=A0 to fly around the house?



=0A

OR, The Argument Need not be Souring


There now is a list-mate named Bowering,
Who might think that the others are cowering;
Though the offense be slight,
If the usage ain't right,
He'll rim-shot a scorn that is towering.

Known as the Nomad Junkie due to his peripatetic lifestyle and =20

from Queens born to West Indian parents. An outsider artist from the =20
get go, he has no degree and has won no awards. His stories, plays, =20
essays, and satire reflect his own anger and frustration as he sees =20
the world's injustice in an everyday observation. An expelled =20
performing artist from Juilliard and maverick of the New York =20
underground, Kangalee has led several lives and is constantly looking =20=

for meaning. Since 1997, he has begged, borrowed, and stolen to =20
support his art.

Urged by the Last Poets to continue writing prose during the creation =20=

of his 2001 cult-film movie about racism and its consequences, As an =20
Act of Protest, Kangalee=92s writing is political and personal. Inspired =
=20
by the Black Arts Movement, punk, and the Theater of the Absurd, =20
Kangalee draws inspiration from his own life as opposed to Literary =20
History or knowledge of the classics. Adopting the =93Nomad Junkie=94 as =
=20
his nom de plume while homeless and later in a self-imposed exile =20
overseas, he writes for the little man caught in the snow and beneath =20=

the corporate avalanche, those who draw lines in the sand, the losers, =20=

the rebels, the tormented, and the romantic rovers hovering on the =20
margins of the mainstream who dare to try to make sense of =93Life in =20=

Society=94 and the doorway of 21st century-Brave New World ethos.

Currently, he is developing his first full-length spoken word album, =20
My Dying City, an experimental radio drama that presents itself as a =20

Congrats on the award.

That's a pretty odd above paragraph, though. Uh, a very romantic paragraph.
Like it was written by someone trying hard to pretend to be a thinker and
critic with some historical perspective. Modernism is a huge historical
period that spans from around 1910 to 1955 or so. Poetry changed quite a bit
in that time. Pound, Eliot, Stevens, Apollinaire, yada yada. Dada. Futurism,
The world went through two world wars. Technological change went through the
roof. Poetry developed as a written thing very dramatically during
modernism. The poetry of people like Pound, Eliot, and Stevens explores the
possibilities of writing and reading way beyond a document as 'score' simply
meant to be read aloud. The notion of 'voice' goes through huge changes. The
notions of juxtaposition, collage, and visuality enter poetry with great
strength. And so much more.

Jared, I hope you'll excuse my=C2=A0most recent (glib)=C2=A0sound/bite. I'm=
 afraid I have no idea how to address the question of what may or may not b=
e relevant in=C2=A0poetry or what could possibly be considered a "relevant =
poetry." I was at a lose when I saw the post concerning the Renewel of Spir=
titually in contemporary poetics. Poetry, after all, is a thing of the spir=
it, yes? So why must it be renewed? Of course, it would be nice if more poe=
ts addressed the urgent concerns of the day rather than dwell exclusively=
=C2=A0on private matters. Yeats was very active in Irish politics. Ditto Po=
und (though not Irish=C2=A0issues=C2=A0... & too bad he...), Eliot ( too ba=
d he, too...), and=C2=A0Lawrence ( my favorite writer/poet/period). The wor=
d Relevant frightens me. When I hear it, I quickly become a Beckett tramp -=
- I ask myself, "Am I beginning to Mean Something." I'm simply not prepared=
 for the burden of even considering what is or isn't relevant in contempora=
ry art & poetry.
 Consider: I'm presently listening to a beautiful Jeff Beck lick from the l=
ate 70s. & it strikes me as=C2=A0prefectly relevant. Why? Because it's beau=
tiful. & what makes it beautiful? Because Beck=C2=A0has mastered the tools =
of his trade and plays beautifully.=20
=C2=A0
Enjoyed your post. Take care --

Publishing Genius is pleased to announce the re-release of Stephanie
Barber's book and DVD, *These Here Separated to See How They Standing Alone

=3D1634314832>
*.

The collection packages a DVD of six of Barber's films with a print version
of their soundtracks. The new version is redesigned, and features a cover
drawing by Peter Barrickman.

Barber's films and artwork have shown internationally at festivals and
museums like MOMA, NY Film Festival, the Tate Modern, Rotterdam, the Poor
Farm and others. Her writing was recently selected by Brian Evenson for the
Wigleaf Top 50. In July, *Artforum* praised her work, saying, "Barber is a
modernist artist fashioning . . . appealing and opaque documents that speak
to our emotional lives."

There was once(1) a subscriber named "Clark"
Who would simply not tolerate snark.
Her dudgeon rose high, til
She clicked on "reply"--
Clark's remarks missed their mark.  We LIKE snark!

Babelfish is highly unreliable when it comes to the translation of Chinese.
You could run a menu through it and it will come out sounding like a "wisdom
saying" half the time.

As for censorship, not sure that it relates to the question you've asked,
but the Great Fire Wall of China is pretty spotty and it doesn't take much
technical knowledge to get around, though there can be serious consequences
if something is traced back to a particular person.

Oh, dear.=20

Snide? I was trying to be amiably humorous, regarding the different attitud=
es that have been expressed about grammatical, spelling, etc. correctness, =
prompted by George Bowering's recent posting, and the history of his simila=
r postings.=20

I ADMIRE people who are sticklers for what they feel is important, so I was=
n't trying to say that what I called "a scorn that is towering" is such a t=
errible thing. I thought that was clear both from invoking the humorous son=
g "You say potayto, and I say potahto", and from the phrase "the argument n=
eed not be souring".

I think I am being mistaken for one of the very angry people who are someti=
mes/often found in poetry these days--I hope I can be understand as not suc=
h--and I certainly hope no-one will actually unsubscribe because of this.=

Jim,

Nobody I think is denying what you are saying. The statement mere states
that the seeds, origins of many of these changes, the forces that propelled
them, came into being during the Romantic period -in my opinion, mostly
through its visionary side.

Ciao,

Murat

various trains of influence out of the many forms of American Radicalism
from the Wobblies on--and involvements of Kerouac and Ginsberg with
these--and its differing from the Radicalism of the folk scene from which
dylan first emerged--

Who are "we"?  This reply illustrates precisely what I said in my last
post.

Plenty of Chinese SPAM novels out there.  No seriously - I lived in Shanghai
for over ten years.  Some of the best fiction in China is web-based.
In so far as censorship is concerned, I doubt that anything of serious merit
could manage to navigate out of the Chinese government's spiderweb.
That is, of course, unless you go through Hong Kong.  Look at Google
for Sun Tzu's sake.  FYI, Wolf Totem was available online long before it
got on to the bestsellers' list.

since so many are making announcements of their works appearing:
here is one from d-bc:

this is a very very great honor & happiness for me to appear in SLOVA  as
Russian art, poetry, writing, cinema,dance has had an immense impact on me
as person and writer/artist since very young when at 12 i first stumbled on
Mayakovsky--
Russian Visual Poetry & Sound Poetry esp have had a profound effect on/with
me--
i Thank with all my heart Gleb Kolomiets for all his work with me and also
especially for his friendship and ongoing conversations via the mails--
and my Thanks to al the editors at SLOVA--
and to Michael Jacobson for introducing me to Gleb--
(there wil be solo show of my works in Russia also--they already appeared i=
n
two traveleing group shows--one re Asemic works which Gleb did al the work
on putting together, a prodigious task as dealing with red tape alone an
exhausting endeavor in every way

The Russian journal SOVA #8 is now available as a pdf--
also some texts are available in English at the web site

beginning on page 7 is the continuation of ongoing conversation/interview b=
y
Gleb Kolomiets & David Baptiste Chirot

throughout the issue there are great many works by Chirot

if interested, i can repost the announcement for SLOVA 7
in which the Kolomiets-Chirot conversation began--this issue has also many
works by Chirot throughout
and also works by Edward Kulemin, a Russian Visual Poet whose works i
greatly like and respect--
both he and Gleb Kolomiets are among the Visual Poets in a forthcoming
Anthology from Openned.com
which i was invited to edit/curate--
(they were invited long before i knew anything re SLOVA)

i recently received the print edition of SLOVA #7--a very impressive,
professional and beautiful publication--
covers in color and everything printed on very high quality paper--with
excellent layouts in the Russian tradition

i think i was probably unclear in several ways

jared my post as a whole wasnt addressed to you ..yr post just set me off o=
n a train (buggy=2C piece of wood sliding downhill

my line about saying something not related to politics was not 'aimed' at t=
his list or anyone on it .. but was a joke interview question that a journa=
list might ask a politician just as a way of scrutinising their tone & seei=
ng if they cd come up with a better one: a workshop question

i used the word politics too reductively  ..'politician' wdve been more acc=

I think the world changed a great deal from Romanticism through Modernism,
Murat. The nomination statement implies Modernism and Romanticism barely
differ, if you read it. Because Romanticism preceded Modernism, of course
the antecedants of the Modern era can usually be found in Romanticism or
among the Victorians. But the nominating statement does not acknowlege the
deep originality of the Modern era--an originality borne from unprecedented
global turmoil, the rise of the middle class in both Europe and North
America, unprecedented scientific and technological advance, and deep
conviction in the power and value of language, art, and science despite the
tragic conditions that prevailed through much of Modernism. Such as World
War I, the Spanish Flu that followed (which killed millions world-wide), the
great (global) depression of the thirties, and World War II.

>>>  "Modernism rejected Romanticism in the way that one political leader

>>> as
>>> 'maker,' to thinking of it as a provoker of consciousness-even a creator
>>> of

 The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is "Symphony No. 2" by Ric Carfagna:
=20
Description:
=20
"Symphony No. 2" by Ric Carfagna (and a follow-up to his "Symphony No. 1") =
is a work not to be construed as a symphony in a strictly classical sense, =
as is the case with the symphonic forms of works by Mozart or Haydn, but mo=
re along the lines of works by obtuse unwieldy 20th century composers such =
as Norgard, Nystroem, Segerstam and Pettersson. It comprises not so much of=
 thematic elements as it does the repetition of images in differing context=
s. It starts off with a burst of dissonance then settles down into a placid=
, surreal, disjunctive utterance. It also attempts to conjure up the ghosts=
 of cubist poetry (a short lived and little known poetic phenomena) with Ca=
rfagna=E2=80=99s own idiosyncratic spin on it.

Edwin Morgan has died, at the age of 90.

        http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/aug/19/edwin-morgan-scotland-national-poet

It's difficult to know what to say.  I was one of his students at Glasgow in
the sixties, so my knowledge of him and his work goes back over forty years.

A towering presence, whose stature increased in the course of years.

Two endings of poems:

'From time the souvenirs are deeds.'
        --"From the Domain of Arnheim"

' -- Of course, but nothing is ever the same.
  now is it?  You'll remember Mercury.'
        -- "The First Men on Mercury"

Robin Hamilton

there will be a tribute to tuli on his birthday sept 28th at the living
theater 7pm onward
free vent  if you want more info back channeol dalachinsky


a walk to the butcher’s @ sunset
       ( for tuli kupferberg)


there are strange animals
that appear between light & dark
dug at glass
spilled on to the street & overall
the bit of dense crochet
the patterns of square content / square in square
shape of body in black thru the window of a bar
square in square
each pane intact / ready to be splintered
here a milestone of visions
exquisite rules of the gone
broken as the corpse itself is divested of age
finally (of) death
sharp pains & grandly groomed
the body no more than the thing itself
a rug & once you wrapped around/inside it

but oh how it looks & feels (as i feel) like you
strands of hair & air tangled in quiet invisibility
& you the thing itself &
pardon me if i divest myself of all but the CARRY
of what remains of the skelter in the cold cold flesh
the step before one’s bones will gleam a bit
inside yer crazy coat
the pinks aghast @ what seems chilly but remarks the silken truthes
there is still the color of your living scalp
claps for all the stretching fold-weeselves inta candles & photographs
of us always  pro   verbs

vencano chura virgin I uh vencano chura  VIRGIN
la madria ah padria zynfoon dehla
eeefahna dark foliage ah morn

place a relic ‘neath the neither & the nether of where-you–go-from- here
light skin        light objects  glaring white surfaces of dark tables of
light
system is the time when system was & wasn’t it  -  undisputed –
borscht & ball of matzo meal
by all standards the gold standard no longer what it is or was
black gloves & overcast sky & the cliché of rain
at the graveyard
sunsets missed in a matter of minutes as one
turns one’s head the other way
dug of glass pirt the woooobster aanawrite
here where’s amorphous chug-a-lug the chachoo smog
the zone sources actually reflected
& sunsets too no longer valid
til another sunset’s come & gone
& you yer gone – but the big jive’s GIVE even that’s collapsed
since no one’s there no longer to deflate it’s AllNess

SALAAAAAAAAAM & lick ‘em clean & break da breath
be ver(y) age-wise  as you are a-skin
at the next stop was the cleaver clean whaaahood toward the FIN-ish

& as you leave us here to box with the empty fools
i have only one small thing to ask

were the butchers like a team of surgeons
or the surgeons more like THEM?

vencano chura virgin I uh vencano chura  VIRGIN

Stephen B.  I=92d suggest that something
identifiable as =93love=2C=94 passionate love=2C is not possible without an=
ger=2C hatred=2C
well-placed hatred.  Knowing hell to
know heaven.  That=92s a buddhist
principle.  I would prefer Blake.  And I=92ll bet the inimitable George Bow=
ering
can take it just fine.  I=92ll bet he
knows his use of the term =93mediocrities=94 holds water. =20

=20

Steve R.  There=92s no
need for me to excuse your remark though I appreciate your concern.  Thank =
you.=20
The truth is holistically there=92s dog in the yard to be cleaned up=97the
value of such fiction=92s framing is that we begin=2C perhaps=2C to see Chi=
na=92s Guiyu
not just from or as or relatable to America but it.  Which is to say=2C the=
re in your mirror=2C mine=2C it. =20

=20

Michael F.  I can
empathize with not wanting to squirm.=20
If we can agree that it=92s just peachy for the wonders (such a popular
word today) of poems and poet trees to go on sprouting the wonders of bubbl=
es
as larger actual worlds=2C literally=2C die =85we do know what species of b=
ear whale
tuna tiger gorilla dog lake weed culture insect ice cap etc etc etc will be
gone in the lifetimes of anyone around in another 40 years=2C right? =85 an=

 artist and
critic hell bent on evolution=2C as opposed to stagnation=2C a =93politicia=
n=94 =85 then
yes=2C politics is something crass to art.=20
I=92ve also attended the poetry workshop.=20


=20

I should probably substantiate that some of the above
actually exists but this doesn=92t seem the appropriate forum.  Plus who am=
 I to judge lol. =20

=20

Steve R=2C the word =93relevant=94 is indeed uncertainly frightening.  ED=
=92s idea about coming at it from the angle
=96 that to somehow get to it one skirts the issue=2C writes and reads arou=
nd it =96
=93it=94 specifically loose here =96 connotation (vast=2C inclusive words) =
versus
denotation (unending=2C drooling words).=20
And I appreciate your honesty=2C =93I=92m simply not prepared for the burde=
n
of even considering what is or isn=92t relevant=85=94  My friend C once pok=
ed and prodded his old Navy buddy to run
naked with him through Joshua Tree.=20
Poked and prodded for days and then=2C =93C=2C I=92m just not psychological=
ly
prepared.=94  That undeniability promptly
ended the prodding.=20

=20

I also couldn=92t disagree more about beauty depending on
mastering tools.  Or=2C more precisely=2C
that it depends on something vocational.=20
You have a point but when I hear this I hear stifling
specializations.  =93Learn the scales=2C
then forget them.=94  The dog in the yard
is beautiful because of what it is=97the fact of the dog plus that which I =
hadn=92t
seen in it [sic] before.  In fact beauty
and wonder would seem to depend more fully on realizing error =96 the admis=
sion
of duncery.  But I think part of the
trouble here would be agreeing on how we=92re using the term =93beautiful.=
=94  I=92d suggest there=92s two kinds of beauty (and
probably more) =96 and sticking to guitar players =96 on the one hand=2C of=
 the sort
John McLaughlin produced in Miles Davis=92s basement that drove all those c=
ritics
nuts =96 in short=2C there is beauty somehow in loss / thwarting of expecta=
tion=2C
the re-discovery of something thought understood (in this case=2C =93music=
=94).  I don=92t know how to define that beauty other
than as that=2C which is of course in line with the definition.  The other =
is based upon all kinds of factors
that lead one to just like blue=2C where one brings to materials and artifa=
cts
and performances his and her expectations and expects them to be fulfilled
albeit in novel ways=2C nonetheless the fulfilling of expectation=2C antici=
pation=2C
etc.  As if memory were involved.  Not =93what=94 you get=2C as the =93what=
=94 is prefab=2C
but =93how=94 you get there.  A diverting
beauty.  The blues-model=2C you might
say. =20

=20

And=2C to end on the correct note=97I have enjoyed your
post=2C and all of them.

Jim, the answer depend to which aspect of the Romantic movement you are
looking at. German Romanticism and accompanying philosophies and poetries
(and also Blake in the English side) have as much to do with the Modern
World as anything else. The difference is that that aspect has resulted in a
more jaundiced view of progress than your view of the unadulterated glories
of modernism. Look at Hegel and Benjamin, or Hegel and Marx, or Nietzsche
and Wagner and Nazism. One can not have one without the other. The 20th
Century has also one of the most atrocious, blood thirsty periods in human
history, its great scientific and intellectual achievements (and I will not
deny those achievements are real) making these blood thirty impulses more
efficient.

I am aware that I am extending the definition of Romanticism back to the end
of 18th century and moving it away from a English focus; but the Millennium
anthology is doing the same thing.

Anyhow, one should not forget, the Industrial Revolution is one of the
creators of Romanicism or that Romanticism in the States took the shape of
Transcendentalism (with deep connections to German and Eastern ideas),
Thoreau, Melvillle, Hawthorne and Dickinson -in many ways, quintessential
modern figures.

Romanticism is not merely Wordsworth's late pablum poetry; but of his
Preludes, as radical a poem as ever has been one; of Blake, of Keats's Odes,
etc.

Ciao,

Murat

In the immense loudness of the immense hate & lies surrounding one non-stop
in the US media--
--loudness, repetition & the Big Lie all going together as Hitler remarked-=
-
i find myself listening --though Jack Spicer (to whom one is of course
paradoxically listening)--says "no one listens to poetry anymore"-
i find myself listening to two poets, Tahar Djaout & Abdellatif Laabi, the
first who lived, wrote, risked & died, the second who writes, risks and was
imprisoned--
as voices, poetry, very much of these times--for their guidance, example--
poets in the US one often finds saying that they are "taking risks in their
writing"--
is it "risks" that one takes when this is the approved mode?
are there not other risks one might  be called--or forced-- to take, if
taking seriously and listening seriously to the immense lies & hate
inundating the "communications" environment--


I have wondered, thought about, studied available information,  for a long
time if decades of the US support, funding and arming of events such as
described in the two articles received from Jewish Peace News linked
below--  have not steadily eroded a resistance to such events, actions,
attitudes occurring within the USA.  Denying and supporting at the same tim=
e
such actions and attitudes, has this not created an atmosphere in which
since 9/11 what is now crystallized by the hysteria over the Mosque/Cultura=
l
Center at Ground Zero --whipped up for politcal expedience without thinking
of where, to what terrible things this may only too tragically lead to--is
allowed to grow in strength, in irrationality, in a hatred which can spiral
out of control?

(from the first of the two articles linked to below, re Ground Zero
"Ramadan Kareem from the Netanyahu and Obama Administrations"
http://www.icahd.org/?p=3D5994
  by Jeff Halper of the Israeli Committee Against Home Demolitions:
:
Now some 1,500 Muslim graves have been cleared in several nighttime
operations to make way for=85..a $100 million Museum of Tolerance and Human
Dignity, a project of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.
(Ironically, Rabbi Marvin Hier, the Wiesenthal Center=92s Director, appeare=
d
on Fox News to express his opposition to the construction of a mosque near
Ground Zero in Manhattan, because the site of the 9/11 attack =93is a
cemetery.=94)


      Already so many of the policies the USA uses itself and supports
abroad regarding torture, detention, rendition, security, surveillance,
secrecy, ethnic cleansing, the super cession & ignoring of both US and
International law are being turned inward, to be used within the USA on
"illegal aliens," on protesters, activists, the Muslim community, and the
enormous backward turn in the treatment of American Indians, that the
boundaries have been crossed as to what is considered as Human Rights.
communication rather than assassination.  Genocide & slavery are not that
far distant in American history that their hideous legacies, continuing to
smolder, are only all to easily encouraged and allowed to "come back to
life" in all manner of deadly forms and expressions.
     Turning blind eyes to what is supported abroad, erodes & dims the
perceptions of what happens "at home."  In fact, the support & encouragemen=
t
of such actions, attitudes, makes them all the more readily able to spring
into action "here."  Hidden in plain site,sight, cite things which have bee=
n
ever more accomodated, rendered perfectly acceptable for many, are not
really noticed at all until the edge is reached, or that situation where it
is "too late."  The history of the 20th century is one in which just such
events occurred, in which groups of persons were singled out and made to
bear the horror of the full brunt of hatred, intolerance, genocide. The
McCarthy years, as often noted in the French and British news groups and
journals' writing of the "new McCarthyism" in the USA of the last few
decades, have already returned, as well as the horrific period of the Palme=
r
Raids, out of which emerged the FBI.
        The ease with which such transformations may occur, "even in
democractic countries," is brilliantly presented in *The Last Summer of
Reason*, by the Algerian Moghrebi poet, journalist and novelist Tahar Djaou=
t
(1954-93).  Leaving for work one fine morning, Djaout was dragged from his
and gunned down in front of his house by extremists. Already in this
country, during the Primaries in various states, Tea Party & other
agitators, extremists, were advocating attacking elected Representives in
front of their homes.
        Djaout famously wrote:

       .Silence is death. / If you are silent you are dead, / And if you
speak you are dead, / So speak and die.

The great Morrocan poet Abdellatif Laabi, himself imprisoned 8 years in his
country before exile in France,  writes in *The World's Embrace  Selected
Poems*
(City Lights, 2003,in French & English: translations by Anne George, Edris
Makward, Victor Reinking & Pierre Joris):*

*
*I risk speaking of my darkness
I am wrapped in darkness
and do not beg for deliverance
I will live inside this chaos
furnish it like a cell
make a bed with the straw of my books*

and:

*Tell me what you see
Are they burning books in public squares
Are they shaving women's heads before stoning them
Are there processions of hooded men
waving crosses and scimitars
Why are you silent, my beloved
Are we on a floating island
or drifting on a torpedo
Are we alone
or chained to other brothers of misfortune*

Abdellatif Laabi in "The Earth Opens and Welcomes You," a poem dedicated to
Tahar Djaout, written but not published until ten years later, sings:

*Sleep well my friend
Sleep the sleep of the just
Get some rest, even from your dreams
let us for awhile carry the burden*

Jack Spicer wrote that "No one listens to poetry;" one might ask oneself if
by this Spicer is not saying that no one *hears* poetry, but that even in
hearing, reading, "no one is listening"--

In times like these, with the examples of such poets as Tahar Djaout &
Abdellatif Laabi, to truly LISTEN to poetry that "risk(s) speaking of (my)
darkness" is of the utmost importance, a matter risking indeed silence, lif=
e
and death--

for, if one listens, are not "we" facing these same questions, may one not
be called to take such risks as not being truly listened to, perhaps even t=
o
the point of life & death for so many around one--

"*Are we on a floating island
or drifting on a torpedo
Are we alone
or chained to other brothers of misfortune"*



Jewish Peace News:

With the tacit agreement of the US administration, Netanyahu has recently
okayed increased home demolitions throughout the West Bank, followed by the
destruction of an entire village in the Negev. Demolitions, dispossession
and displacement by Israel continue both beyond and within the "green line.=

it's very moving that you're doing this, Amy--I know its debatable whether
political poetry changes anything & that is a huge subject--am reading Mark
Scroggins' wonderful bio of Zukofsky now & that comes up in his life
often--but it's necessary for those who rea this to know that the poetry
community is at least thinking about what is happening to our planet.

thanks for writing, Amy, exactly on point--I am thinking how to incorporate
global warming & other issues--poor Pakistan, for ex, beyond all
imagination--into my poetry without being didcatic--and the ecopoetry panel
at the rethinking poetics conf in June was stimulating--thought it was goin=
g
to be up on UTube but haven't seen it--does anyone know.
keep on,
ruth

Hi Everyone

Does anyone know how I can cheaply obtain a copy of Retallack and Spahr's
Poetry and Pedagogy: The Challenge of the Contemporary, a book published a
few years ago?  the book is ridiculously expensive to buy new and my two
main sources of books, the Brooklyn Public and CUNY libraries do not own
this book.  I am embarrassingly, shamefully poor and disastrously in need of
a new pedagogy and poetics.  I am hoping that this book will renew my
energies, teaching experiences and my bank account, after I am hired for
excitingly new poetry teaching gigs inspired by this book.

I tremendously love adverbs.  Do you?

Please backchannel if you know how I can get this book on the cheap.  Free,
even.

Your pal,
Douglas Manson

Yes, it was especially horrific precisely because of the scale and
conviction with which many of its massacres were executed, and this was only
possible with greater butchery through technology.

But this also distinguishes the Modern era from the era of Romanticism,
Murat, highlights yet another of the dramatic differences between them.

The point of the discussion, recall, is that, contrary to the nominating
statement, Modernism differs quite strongly from Romanticism.

Not to say that the Romantic or its effects and influence was not present in
Modernity or has departed even now.

The nominating statement says "Modernism rejected Romanticism in the way
that one political leader rejects another--not because it is any different
but because it wishes to win the same audience. This book demonstrates that
the only thing that happened in Modernism was that a door opened onto still
another aspect of the immense cultural experiment that Romanticism was..."
It says they hardly differ and that Modernism merely extends what is already
announced in Romanticism. Both of those statements are obviously false. And
I'm not quite sure 'where they're going' with that.

Call for Fellowship Applications:
Movement, Somatics and Writing: A Practice-Based Research Symposium
February 18th/19th, Duderstadt Video Performance Studio, University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor

Conference Team:
Amy Sara Carroll, Assistant Professor of English and American Culture
(Latina/o Studies), UM
Thom Donovan, poet and essayist, co-editor of ON: Contemporary
Practice and the weblog Wild Horses Of Fire
Kate Elswit, Andrew W. Mellon Fellow (Drama/Dance), Stanford University
Bhanu Kapil, Assistant Professor, Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied
Poetics, Naropa University (Cross-Genre Narrative and Poetics)
Jina Kim, PhD student, English/Women?s Studies, UM (Visual Culture)
Petra Kuppers, Associate Professor of English, UM (Performance Studies)
Eleni Stecopoulos, poet, writer, educator, curator of the Poetics of
Healing project at the Poetry Center, San Francisco State University

In our forth arts-based inquiry symposium (after Anarcha: African
American culture/Disability Culture/Medical Ethics; Touching Time:
Bodies/Writing/Histories; Eco-Performance) we want to build on the
inter- or transdisciplinary methods explored so far, and invite
scholars and artists to engage in experimental writing and art
practice at the sites/cites of the moving, living body and the moving,
living text.

We invite up to ten fellows (graduate students, faculty, independent
artists and writers) to come together for two days, to workshop, to
use performances and presentations as provocations, and to plumb
methods of merging art practice and critical writing . The specific
topics we will address are yet to be determined by applicants?
interests. But, to date, this symposium?s foci include or relate to
innovative methodologies, writing-as-practice, somatics/embodiment,
breath poetics, prosodic magic, language limit zones, conceptual
?isms, skin and membranes, mixed media and metaphors, the ethics of
touch and movement, enjambed spacetime, transitions and becoming
______ . We will be in praxis together: this is not a conference to
share the results of previous research or practice. Thus, we are not
looking for papers, performances, portfolios, or readings; we plan to
experiment. Come and share the excitement of your creative and
critical research, present a workshop based on your passions, and find
out what could happen?

Each invitee will have transport and accommodation costs reimbursed up
to $200 dollars. The conference hotel offers rooms for about sixty
dollars a night, and we will assist people who want to be hosted by
graduate students.

Application Process: please send a short CV, a sample of your writing
(creative, experimental, performative or critical), and a brief
statement about why you would like to participate, to petra@umich.edu.
You can also send URLs or a DVD or CD with performance or visual arts
material. Query first about snail mail address by emailing the
symposium director: Petra Kuppers, petra@umich.edu.

Deadline: October 1, 2010 Notification: October 20, 2010

Double (musical) Seance for Stephen Dydo and Adam Tobin

Rhythm from the Casio SK-1 with lead viola

Best yet because of accompaniment; in 4, it's a continuous chord and
in 3 it's a series held in the SK-1's limited memory - starting and
stopping create the stanzaic structure of the piece.

Don't assume you have any idea about my views, please, Murat."

Jim, you do have a gung-ho attitude towards progress and glories of
modernism. Here is how you express it: "But the nominating statement does
not acknowlege the deep originality of the Modern era--an originality borne
from unprecedented global turmoil, the rise of the middle class in both
Europe and North America, unprecedented scientific and technological
advance, and deep conviction in the power and value of language, art, and
science despite the tragic conditions that prevailed through much of
Modernism."

The rise of middle class and technological advances had already started in
the 19th century. De Toqueville's work on America is all about that. What
does "deep conviction in the power and value of language, art and science"
mean? Do you mean before the Modern Age these things were not valued? What
about the Biblical "at the beginning was the word"? Is there a stronger
statement about the value of language? As for the "value of art" - have you
thought about Benjamin's essay about the work of art in an age of mechanical
reproduction? Once again, I am not denying the profound significance of the
intellectual achievements and social transformations of the 20th century;
but to think that these occurred out of nothing, that time starts at 1901
is, pardon my expression, a bit ridiculous.

"Yes, it was especially horrific precisely because of the scale and
conviction with which many of its massacres were executed, and this was only
possible with greater butchery through technology."

But, Jim, that is what you say: "unprecedented scientific and technological
advance, and deep conviction in the power and value of language, art, and
science *despite* the tragic conditions that prevailed through much of
Modernism."

The word "despite" do not suggest a cause and effect relationship. In fact,
many of the glories of modern thought were often also the enablers of these
conditions. Your initial statement tries to separate them.

With the rest of your statement I do not have much disagreement. Of course,
the Modern Era created new intellectual conditions, often attacking Romantic
thinkers, poets and artists themselves. But these attacks are often
exaggerated, disingenuous or one sided. For instance, I am reading at the
present moment Brian Kim Stefans's The Fashionable Noise. In one of his
essays in the book he uses a Tennison "translation" I believe of an old
Scottish ballad  as a source text. Many 19th century writers and thinkers
have constituted the backbone of Modern thought. This to seems self evident.
Didn't Cantor do most of his work in the 19th century?

Ciao,

Murat

"3 Guys from Albany" to Perform at Oklahoma LaborFest, to Visit Albany, =
OK

"3 Guys from Albany," a poetry performance group, have been invited to =
be featured poets at the Oklahoma LaborFest, held August 26-28 in =
Oklahoma City, OK. "3 Guys from Albany" will perform on August 26 at =
Coffey=92s Caf=E9 in the Plaza District (http://www.coffyscafe.org/#) =
and will read as part of =93Oklahoma Speaks=94 on August 28 at the Lyric =
Theatre Auditorium (http://www.oklahomarevelator.com/laborfest).  On =
August 27, "3 Guys from Albany" will perform at the Albany/Wade Senior =
Center in Albany, OK.  A complete itinerary is included below.

"3 Guys from Albany" (Tom Nattell, Charlie Rossiter and Dan Wilcox) have =
a mission to read their poetry in each of the Albanys in the U.S.  They =
are friends who share the idea that poetry should be a part of society =
rather than apart from it -- relevant, communicative and, above all, =
honest.  Their poems address social issues such as the homeless, peace =
and war, and the environment, as well as joyful celebrations of art, =
love and life.  They have toured the United States since 1993 and so far =
they have read in 12 of the 18 Albanys in the USA.  They have released a =
60-minute cassette tape and CD of their poetry performance, available at =
their readings or by mail.  Although Tom Nattell died of cancer in =
January 2005, Charlie & Dan are continuing the project, along with the =
ever-present nudging from the spirit of Tom.

Charlie Rossiter is a recipient of an NEA fellowship for his poetry and =
is the host of www.poetrypoetry.com.=20

Dan Wilcox hosts the Third Thursday open mic at the Social Justice =
Center in Albany, NY & has the world's largest collection of photos of =
unknown poets.  You can find him at dwlcx.blogspot.com

Tom Nattell was an international mail artist, environmentalist, poet and =
peace activist who wrote the "Simple Life" column for Metroland, =
Albany's entertainment weekly.

This Art Burning brings to the Philly Fringe=20
Festival the collaborations of composer Ellen
Fishman-Johnson and poet Michael Heller. Their=20
unique multimedia works integrate
Fishman-Johnson=92s music and video with Heller=92s=20
modernist texts on autobiography,
art, history, religion and culture, several of=20
which were created especially for this performance.

Fishman-Johnson and Heller have been working=20
together since they met at the Yaddo
artist colony in 1990. Their first collaboration,=20
Heteroglossia, for taped music and text (1991),
earned them an invitation to the 1991 Montreal=20
International Computer Music Conference.
Their next work, Freedom, after all? premiered at=20
the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore
in 1992. Their Internet film, After Montale,=20
produced in 2002 and based on a poem by Heller,
creates a musical score paced to the visual unfolding of the text.

Their most extensive undertaking to date,=20
Benjamin, is a multimedia opera based on
the life and tragic suicide of Walter Benjamin,=20
the 20th century German-Jewish literary
critic and philosopher. It was presented at the=20
Philadelphia Fringe Festival in 2000. The
Philadelphia Inquirer praised the work for the=20

perfectly communicative.=94 Portions of
the opera are in this program.

=93Autobiographia,=94 is a highly-charged
multimedia exploration through music and words of=20
the Jewish cultural and musical heritage
the two artists share.

A highlight of this performance is the premier of=20
a new piece for violin and video,
Out of Pure Sound, featuring four of Heller=92s=20
poems, and performed by violinist Leah Kim.

Other artists involved in the program are=20
percussionist Harvey Price and pianist,
Sheri Melcher who will accompany singers Shannon Coulter, Amanda Matyas,
Brian Vandenberge and Robert Brandt. Christopher G. McGinley will direct a
small choir. Lighting is by Catherine Lee and sound design by Simon Rogers.

This project is partially supported by a grant=20
from the Philadelphia Chapter of the American Composers Forum.

Okay.  You're right.  First I stopped driving cars and grew new feet, then I
learned endocrine phonology and syncopated heartbeat prosody, then I drew a
circle around myself and promised not to leave until a bird landed on my
outstretched arm and sang 14 iambs.

Afterward I enrolled in the curriculum of the soul and paid all my back
parataxes.

Next stop, Coney Island with a six pack and a relapsed phenomenologist.

Pick up thy lyres and toot, o craftspeople.

Furniture Press Books and Black Radish Books. In this turn, Emily Carr
and David Wolach enter something that looks like the pages of Jaques
Derrida's Cinders.

Emily Carr reviews David Wolach's Occultations, while David reviews
Emily's Directions for Flying.

THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ALLEN GINSBERG'=0AThe re-release of Jerry Aronson's b=
iopic, The Life and Times of Allen Ginsberg, =0Atimed to celebrate the fift=
ieth anniversary of 'Howl,' suits this wonderful =0Adocumentary and proves =
Ginsberg central to all radical artistic and political =0Amovements of the =
past 60 years. The feature-length film, segmented by decade, =0Aprovides am=
ple footage of Ginsberg's life; but extras added into this package, =0Aincl=
uding footage of his memorial and 35 interviews with artists inspired by th=
e =0Avisionary poet--from Beck to Lawrence Ferlinghetti--solidify Ginsberg =
as an =0AAmerican cultural icon. The film unravels Ginsberg's obsession for=
 life and =0Adeath around his mother's nervous breakdown and his father's a=
ffinity for =0Apoetry. Interviews with Ginsberg from each decade, both amon=
gst his Beat friends =0Alike Burroughs and Huncke, and later with talk show=
 hosts William Buckley and =0ADick Cavett, show the author's progression fr=
om sexual politics in the '40s and =0A'50s to the 'politics of ecstasy' in =
the '60s and '70s, when he founded the =0AFlower Power movement with Tim Le=
ary, and later, Naropa Univeristy. Ample =0Afootage of Ginsberg's stepmothe=
r provides a sensitive outsider's opinion on how =0Ahe blossomed into one o=
f the most spontaneous minds of the century. The film =0Atranscends simple =
Ginsberg descriptions by framing his life with historical =0Ahappenings to =
contextualize the author's words and actions. The Life and Times =0Aof Alle=
n Ginsberg reminds the viewer that there is no better example of an =0Aarti=

Urchin? Yes. Brautigan's origins as a kid were those of a Depression era di=
rt scraping for whatever he could find & value genuine urchin. But he also =
grew to be 6' 4" - not exactly an urchin look!=A0 But, in my memory, he alw=
ays lookt physically stark, frail - a scarecrow with the poetry of a sweeth=
eart.=20
I suspect he would love the idea of Conrad & Co. putting his poems up in th=
e air for free. In San Francisco circa 1967, he liked to give broadsides of=
 his poems away gratis on the street.=20

At the cooperative (http://organicvalley.coop)  I work at we are
encouraging a lot of farmers to grow sunflowers, hazelnuts or
switchgrass & produce their own bio-fuels on site. No
mega-corporations, endangered environment, policy wonks, graft,

what an idea mr ford!!! amazing!!!
the car and millions of them!!!

thank you, yes, it's the way to go.

it's great, just great, except it ends up destroying the planet.

what? destroying the planet? how could it?

the chemical burning process of the fuel pollutes the atmosphere and wars
are fought for possession of oil resources and even though we come to
realize that oil is destroying the planet, the massive global engines of
industry depend on it and will not relinquish their dependence on it.

i couldn't possibly know that.

because the internet is the only place to talk with progressive people who
say computers are to blame for the economic collapse and computer art is
fascistic.

kidding aside, our engineers need to consider eco systems when building
engine systems, and i think we're all sick of billionaire oil idiots running
the world into the ground and politician stooges like george w bush catering
to their desires at the expense of the environment. it seems fairly obvious
by now, doesn't it, that the engines of industry (and our cars and so on)
are going to have to burn things like hydrogen, the byproduct of which is
water, rather than petroleum. and the same goes for the engines that make
those engines.

"The Conspiracy Against Poems" by Adam Fieled at The Argotist Online
http://www.argotistonline.co.uk/Fieled%20essay%205.htm
=20
Excerpts:
=E2=80=9CThere is no historical evidence to suggest that during the Romanti=
c era, something called =E2=80=9CPoetics=E2=80=9D existed. At the time, Wor=
dsworth and Coleridge, both identifiable as =E2=80=9CLake=E2=80=9D poets, i=
nitiated investigations of a theoretical nature, centered on poetry. These =
investigations were one of Coleridge=E2=80=99s m=C3=A9tiers; Wordsworth rar=
ely identified himself as something other than a poet. The controversies th=
at surrounded Wordsworth, from the publication of Lyrical Ballads forwards,=
 were centered jointly on his poems and the theories that buttressed them. =
Why is it that in 2010, a majority of poets, particularly those toiling in =
experimental milieus, seem both more grounded in and more stimulated by the=
ories than by the poems they bolster? What is this nebulous entity, =E2=80=
=9Cpoetics,=E2=80=9D and how has it sapped the life out of what it is meant=
 to serve? The chief weakness of the pursuit of =E2=80=9Cpoetics,=E2=80=9D =
as I see it, is that it puts premiums on two red herrings=E2=80=94novelties=
 and political correctness. =E2=80=9CPoetics,=E2=80=9D as practiced by the =
bolder American universities, wants to investigate the newest of the new, a=
nything (striated, of course, within the taut bounds of political correctne=
ss) that has not been done before. But practicing =E2=80=9Cpoetics=E2=80=9D=
 creates and perpetuates its own kind of romantic ideology=E2=80=94an unthi=
nking and uncritical belief in one=E2=80=99s self-representations as plante=
d firmly in the new, fresh, and bold.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CPoets weaned on poetics never quite reconcile themselves to the re=
ality that poems spun out of flimsy theoretical material cannot have any gr=
eat or striking impact, either in the long or the short term. All this move=
ment towards theory and concept is mirrored in other art forms; but as the =
post-modern impulse ages, it may be seen that when taken to an extreme, as =
it has been in experimental poetry, it creates such an aura of rapid obsole=
scence around new poetry that one wonders why new poems are being written a=
t all.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CSimply put, poetics is mainly a construct established and put into=
 propulsive motion by white, middle-class academics; and as multiculturalis=
m has emerged as a subsidiary branch of post-modernism, a sense of guilt mo=
ves participants not only towards the outr=C3=A9 but towards anything ethni=
c or deviant. The problem with poetics generally is that there is little qu=
ality control. The conceit of post-modern poetics is that there is no such =
thing as =E2=80=9Cquality=E2=80=9D; quality is a teetering edifice erected =
by hegemonic white males to reinforce a master narrative patched up against=
 invasion.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CGenerations are now beginning to emerge who have been weaned on th=
ese approaches. The upshot is that poets have been formed who respond to th=
eory first, poems second. If poems are a subsidiary branch of theories, the=

      I’d like to begin this yammering by apologizing for the delay in
new free content at www.UnlikelyStories.org. As you probably know, we’ve
been working hard on our new line of perfectbound books. I never wanted
the free material at UnlikelyStories.org to particularly suffer in favor
of these books, but it has, and I want to apologize for that. We intend
to put out an issue in mid-September.

This year, we’re releasing Tom Bradley’s /My Hands Were Clean /bound
together in one volume with Deb Hoag’s /Dr. Gonzo/, Anne McMillen’s
/Monolith/ bound together with León De la Rosa’s /Soy solo palabras but
wish to be a city/, and /Unlikely Stories of the Third Kind/, a 400-page
anthology featuring visual art, a CD, and a DVD intended to be
representative of the wide variety of work UnlikelyStories.org has been
publishing since 1998. We planned to hold a massive affair at the
upcoming Burning Man Festival. Unfortunately, this event has had to be
rescheduled due to illness. We apologize to everyone who hoped to see us
there, and regret that a clothing-optional book release party is off
this year’s plate.

However, a new release strategy has been planned. Unlikely Books will be
performing at the Bowery Poetry Club in Manhattan on Sunday, November
21^st . We will do four other reads in the week before that performance.
We’re tentatively planning on reading in Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
Boston, Cape Cod, and one other New York City read. There’s debate as to
where the other New York City and the Boston reads should be, and we
welcome input.

Each show will be different--I mean, of course they will be, we’re all
young and brash and sexy but not actually so young as to do five
performances in one week--each show will have different contributors to
/Unlikely Stories of the Third Kind/. If you are a contributor to
/Unlikely Stories of the Third Kind/ or if Unlikely has published a
physical chapbook of yours, and you’ll be in the Northeast Corridor the
third week of November, write me and let me know; I’d be delighted to
put you on a playbill. If you’ve already done that, please be
patient--you will hear back.

/Unlikely Stories of the Third Kind/ should begin shipping September
7^th --we’ll be boxing ‘em up and singing union songs on Labor Day
(well, I know a little Phil Ochs, so that’s close enough). At this time,
you can still go to http://shop.makeitnewmedia.com/Unlikely-Books_c3.htm
and pre-order copies of /Unlikely Stories of the Third Kind/ to get free
shipping on this five-pound book, and frankly, I think you should. I’ll
turn off free shipping when I get up on September 7^th .

/My Hands Were Clean/Dr. Gonzo/ will begin shipping on September 11^th
(well, that’s a Saturday, so probably September 13^th , possibly
September 10^th , but you know, in celebration of the founding of the
Satyagraha movement). /Monolith/Soy solo palabras but wish to be a city/
will be released on our November mini-tour.

If you’re looking for something to read until then, do consider our
chapbooks at http://shop.makeitnewmedia.com/Unlikely-Books_c3.htm , or
the chapbooks of our buddies at Virgogray press at
http://shop.makeitnewmedia.com/Virgogray-Press_c7.htm . Also there are
twelve years of archives at http://www.UnlikelyStories.org/ . That’s
neat, too.

Thanks for bearing with us, and we hope to see you, however
modestly-dressed, in November!

The poetry of Larry Sawyer arrives free of any investment in a =93poetics=

worldview and therefore ties its shoes on the run: =93The city is a Smith a=

world in the Smith and Wesson. So there=92s a spontaneity of composition
(anything can happen and does) that reminds us of what Ren=E9 Char was
supposed to have been. On first impression, the poems can seem scattershot,
like the art works of Niki de Saint Phalle composed by shotgun. Some of the
pellets form patterns, some impressions they make are deeper than others,
and some even pierce the metal canvas. Because Sawyer=92s style is so open,
the casual and intense find comfort in each other and the remarkable detail
emerges: =93What horizon / spreads in the distance / muscles ripening?=94 M=

of this work is therefore fresh and unexpectable, like the final line of hi=

=94 =97*Paul

The split infinitive title that is *Unable to Fully California *prompts the
question: What in 2010 is most real? Larry Sawyer leads us in response to
=93the exotic trigonometry=94 that invokes twirled concepts, blended wines,=
 plus
deliciously intentional mistakes. In this spree of sight and sound, nouns
take up residence while collocating in new roles as verbs alive in
trans-plantation. The tenor and vehicle of similes yield a vivid array of
bleached blond poems that skid across the page. Their x axis is transmuted
from horizon line to stars as yet unnamed from which we readers readily
infer we=92re not in Kansas anymore. =97*Sheila E. Murphy*





I love the clear style, unforced music. It is not so much a strange poetry

Actually, "poetics" was a useful and much-debated concept that
eighteenth-century poets and scholars routinely traced back to Classical
Greco-Roman work.

From *A New and Complete Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Comprehending All
the Branches of Useful Knowledge *(1754):
"POETICS: the doctrine of poetry, or the laws and rules of conducting
pieces, or compositions of poetry, such as Aristotle's poetics, a work much
valued."

From *The Critical Review, or Annals of Literature *(1797), in a review of
the second edition of Coleridge's *Poems*:
"As no author can justly be offended at liberal criticism, Mr. Coleridge
'returns his acknowledgements to the different reviewers for the assistance
which they have afforded him in detecting his poetic deficiencies.' Upon a
revisal of his productions, he has omitted some which he was less pleased,
and has substituted new pieces for the discarded poems."

The same volume uses the the term in broader scope for a review of *Herder
on the Advancement of the Belles Letteres*:* *
*"fourth fragment* (letter eighty seventh) points out the influence of the
Provencal poetry on the culture and poetics of Europe. The qualities,
exterior and internal, of the Italian poetry are considered. The
characteristics of French tales and theatrical pieces are also examined;
after which observations occur on the poetics of Spain."

I could cite lots more examples, but a basic search for "poetics" (limited
to volumes published between 1700-1800) on Google Books will give you about
2,720 results. ECCO, is even better, if you have access to it. (Of course,
the overwhelming majority of of these hits will be attributable to European
middle- or upper-class men.)

Adam, I'm not trying to be rude - just trying to clarify, but I'd be
interested knowing:

1. When/where do you suggest that the concept of "poetics" comes into
being? Could it be that you are arguing with someone (or some school) in
particular?

2. Are you suggesting that "poetics" means something different in the 21c.
than it meant in the Romantic period?

3. You suggest that "poets have been formed who respond to theory first,
poems second" - how, precisely, are you distinguishing between "theory" and
"poetry" in this context? (Can the distinction as you're making it be
applied to all poets throughout poetic history?) (Is that what you're tryin=
g
to do?)

4. How do you intuit whether poetry or theory came first in a particular
work without getting bogged down in dead-end debates about author
intentionality?

5. Why are you so invested in Coleridge and Wordsworth specifically? (In
dismissing political correctness, are you invalidating all the
feminist/Marxist/post-colonial arguments leveled against the limits of thei=
r
"new language"?) If you are interested in more diverse work, would it,
perhaps, be worthwhile to consider poetics as they are developed in
non-Western histories of poetry? I am not deeply familiar with the history
of Asian poetry, but, just guessing from the importance of poetry to court
culture, I would imagine that they have a history of poetry theory that is
much longer and better documented than the European history. Persian poetry
has exquisitely complex rules, and has for millennia.

Any clarification would be much appreciated.

All best wishes,

205.htm=0A=0AExcerpts:=0A=E2=80=9CThere is no historical evidence to sugges=
t that during the Romantic era, =0Asomething called =E2=80=9CPoetics=E2=80=
=9D existed. At the time, Wordsworth and Coleridge, both =0Aidentifiable as=
 =E2=80=9CLake=E2=80=9D poets, initiated investigations of a theoretical na=
ture, =0Acentered on poetry. These investigations were one of Coleridge=E2=
=80=99s m=C3=A9tiers; =0AWordsworth rarely identified himself as something =
other than a poet. The =0Acontroversies that surrounded Wordsworth, from th=
e publication of Lyrical =0ABallads forwards, were centered jointly on his =
poems and the theories that =0Abuttressed them. Why is it that in 2010, a m=
ajority of poets, particularly those =0Atoiling in experimental milieus, se=
em both more grounded in and more stimulated =0Aby theories than by the poe=
ms they bolster? What is this nebulous entity, =0A=E2=80=9Cpoetics,=E2=80=
=9D and how has it sapped the life out of what it is meant to serve? The =
=0Achief weakness of the pursuit of =E2=80=9Cpoetics,=E2=80=9D as I see it,=
 is that it puts =0Apremiums on two red herrings=E2=80=94novelties and poli=
tical correctness. =E2=80=9CPoetics,=E2=80=9D as =0Apracticed by the bolder=
 American universities, wants to investigate the newest =0Aof the new, anyt=
hing (striated, of course, within the taut bounds of political =0Acorrectne=
ss) that has not been done before. But practicing =E2=80=9Cpoetics=E2=80=9D=
 creates and =0Aperpetuates its own kind of romantic ideology=E2=80=94an un=
thinking and uncritical =0Abelief in one=E2=80=99s self-representations as =
planted firmly in the new, fresh, and =0Abold.=E2=80=9D=0A=E2=80=9CPoets we=
aned on poetics never quite reconcile themselves to the reality that =0Apoe=
ms spun out of flimsy theoretical material cannot have any great or strikin=
g =0Aimpact, either in the long or the short term. All this movement toward=
s theory =0Aand concept is mirrored in other art forms; but as the post-mod=
ern impulse ages, =0Ait may be seen that when taken to an extreme, as it ha=
s been in experimental =0Apoetry, it creates such an aura of rapid obsolesc=
ence around new poetry that one =0Awonders why new poems are being written =
at all.=E2=80=9D=0A=E2=80=9CSimply put, poetics is mainly a construct estab=
lished and put into propulsive =0Amotion by white, middle-class academics; =
and as multiculturalism has emerged as =0Aa subsidiary branch of post-moder=
nism, a sense of guilt moves participants not =0Aonly towards the outr=C3=
=A9 but towards anything ethnic or deviant. The problem with =0Apoetics gen=
erally is that there is little quality control. The conceit of =0Apost-mode=

This revised and expanded edition of =E2=80=9CParadigm of the Tinctures=E2=
=80=9D by Steve McCaffery and Alan Halsey revisits the classic humanist ide=
a of the Sister Arts where poetry is understood to be a speaking picture an=
d a picture a silent poem.  The revisitation, however, is bluntly revisiona=
ry and the result is a fresh text-graphic dialogue.

Dear Jacqui Weeks--

Many many thanks for this wonderful, inspiring letter, with so many
questions & examples to work with!--

In my limited experience, no matter what culture & time period i have &
continue to read poetry in, there is always a poetics, many poetics, writte=
n
by and about the poets one is reading--whether it be essays, reviews,
critical notices or remarks in letters, notebooks, and within the works
themselves . . .

The more different cultures & time periods i read in, the more poetics one
finds--
it is not as though people in some "pre-theory" age or world, from the poin=
t
of view of a very narrow contemporary American point of view--did not THINK
very intensely about what poetry is, about the work that poets were doing,
about the ways in which poetry functions in relation with the language it i=
s
being written in--the society it is being written in--about the structures
and elements of letters, words, lines, phrases, sound, visuality,readership=
,
distribution--
the questions of copying, plagiarism, the "writing of the No," all the
questions with which one may work in the "current context" existed elsewher=
e
and, in many ways, since the very creation of writing itself, even before i=
t
became formalized into writing "systems"--one finds examples of poets,
"proto-poets," thinking about what today is called "poetics,"--a name which
as Jacqui Weeks points out--is a term already used by and defined by
Aristotle, as one example alone--

Last week, within one of the brief "El Colonel" pieces i write, often at
facebook,-- which are fiction which includes "monologues" or "thoughts" by
the protagonist along the lines of what Mallarme called the "poeme
critique"--a reader responded by directing me to certain sections of
Aristotle's Poetics--for more to think about in relation with the thoughts
expressed in the piece-and the sections recommended a great opening into
what was written and far beyond--

A very great, revelatory & deeply profound  recent example of a poetry and
its poetics working with each other is Murat Nemet-Nejat's EDA: An Antholog=
y
of Contemporary Turkish Poetry.

A groundbreaking classic in global poetry and poetics  in human history is
still Jerome Rothernberg's Technicians of the Sacred--

and one may turn to Jerry's blog Poets & Poetics to find poetics from,
again--a global context, from all eras of the histories of different parts
of the world, a wide variety of languages, cultures, poems, songs, writings=
,
poetics---



The internet is overflowing with poetries & poetics from the world over,
with examples from historical periods pre-dating Aristotle . . . to the mos=
t
contemporary, exciting theory one can-- and cannot!!-even imagine until
finding these works--available via simple search--

It is often pointed out that Americans, in poetics, poetry also--tend to be
too isolationist, too much in mind consciously or not of being "Number One,=
"
and so ignore what is happening, what has happened, outside of the USA, and
often outside the immediate sound byted present--

Actions, events, examples, information which may seem "true" within a very
narrow context--and in whose own interest it is necessary to continually
limit, control, what are given as examples, ideas, concepts, histories,
poets and poetries, poetics--to be sound byted, discussed, discarded, and s=
o
on--are heavily dependent on their being taken to be as it were,
unquestioningly, "at the center of the world, at the most up-to-the-minute
moment in time"--so that the competition to remain dominant, to be perceive=
d
as "the Number One," with in this proscribed sphere, require continual
efforts to control & limit what is produced, discussed, what it is that top=
s
the "hit parade" for inclusion in the "leading" syllabi, anthologies,
critical studies, etc etc--a self-reproducing "machine" that engenders its
own fears and anxieties about being "part of it all"--and which, if one
stops accepting it unquestioningly, is for the most part a parade of
"Emperors with No Clothes"--

It struck me in reading Adam's excerpts from his essay that many of the
"things" which appear to be disturbing him  regarding the continual
"necessity" of the latest, newest, most fashionable etc are perhaps
primarily "market driven," in the sense that for any discipline, within
itself, there is the drive to continue producing materials which generate i=
n
turn   ways of classifying, colonizing, territroializing both "new works"
under a given rubric, as well as generating retrospectively their
"predecessors," or "examples avant la lettre," all of which produce new
anthologies, course syllabi, examples for essays, papers, theses,
interviews, reviews--
and, in turn--are used to create new positions within sub divisions with in
departments in academia etc etc or new areas requiring "new" reviewers,
bloggers, web sites, curators of exhibitions, performances etc etc--

But these are only a few very small glimpses of the myriad ways to "look at=
"
the situation perhaps--

Again, many many thanks to You,  Jacqui Weeks for this exceptional, greatly
informing and inspiring letter!--
