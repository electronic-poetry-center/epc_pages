Ben. I thought you'd never ask! Hans Arp was a sculptor and ( as many of his
trade such as Barbara Moore and Hep Rodin) he worked  outside in quarries or
in the vicinity of zoos. Their (his) obsession was perfection (which we see
in certain works that sheer and convolute into terrible lexic alterity whose
thrust is the infinute minus one) (alterity you could check out with Lynn
Heijinian) and it was always his habit to work in the open (for hadnt Rilke
been sent to a zoo? Didnt Cezanne catch his death trying to catch another
shape? Michelangelo leave "unrecovered" and potent potential blocks that
stand forever half emerging, and, sadly, half cloaked in stone? Nein?)
  But Hans always carried an umbrella. Being non-english, he couldnt
pronounce that word, so he substituted a French word from a battered  18th
century Lexicon he had obtained, at great trouble and expense, from the
castle of one Mslle Eliose Francoise Diderot, who resided therein in  (a
rather decayed) splendour in a minor town (where the castle was). Rather a
large tome (the obtainance of which involved swimming a moat) he had caught
a bad cough and also became what is known by specialists as a hydrophobe.
These latter do evince a tendency to write "in tongues" as it were...Hence
his stupid babbling that was written down by his assistant Stone Chopper as
you have in the German, but was actually: "Give caspar (the ghost) a hot
tod" which (from watching thousands of American Disney movies (to which
degeneracy he was an early and avid addict)) was in fact the only English he
knew. The assistant realised the danger that Arp, with his terrible back,
his plueral cough, and his obsession with words etc was  in of sliding into
coherence, and to humour his master, wrote out the pseudo babble you have
quoted with reams of other twaddle. This, and the use of an enormous
umbrella (the assistant knew the English for this strange object) saved his
sanity and his life. He did some good sculptors, but as to his writeings,
they  were (and are) alass, totally non-lexical (meaningless)......perhaps
some of the "words" (of stone, in stone, stoned etc) might be found in
Borges infinite library.....but anyway, he recovered and survived to live to
a great old age - his mind wonderfully clear - and his Lexicon can now be
viewed in Antwerp Museum.
 So I hope that clears things up.  Richard.

I'm translating some Hans Arp poems for fun and would like to know if
"parapluie" in the line "auf dem meer verwirrte er die schiffe mit dem
woertchen/ parapluie..." is a non-lexical word, as I understand it to be.  I
understand it to be something like 'all over the place', or 'with no real
discretion'.  In the same poem (no title. first line: weh unser kaspar ist
tot) he uses another word 'heufische' in the line "die heufische klappern in
den glocken..." which I take to be the conjunction of hay and fish.. so
literally  something like "the patter of fish in the grass/hay.." Is this
right or am I missing some associations??  If anone could offer some advice
I'd be grateful.

A better job of Baudelaire, the air in four locations:

A lot better. So if you've been looking for bees
It's the Swiss Alps’ crystal clear delight in the world of Baudelaire,

Of bees, it's the Provence region in four natural formulas:

As crystal clear, and no one does a family
And no one does a family-scented company near Avignon
Delicately wildflowers fill the south of blending
Them into soaps with shea better job of blending
Them soothe and no one
Does a bit longer
And restores and restores a youthful heal
Restores wildflowers to fill this south of blending
And fragrance makes it a lot
A better job of blending
And soaps available in a mild location
To heal, soothe, and restore a complete location
Of jelly-scented bees.

Gwendolyn Brooks, Whose Poetry Told of Being Black in America, Dies at 83

By MEL WATKINS

New York Times


Gwendolyn Brooks, who illuminated the black experience in America in poems
that spanned most of the 20th century, winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1950,
died yesterday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.

"I wrote about what I saw and heard in the street," Ms. Brooks once said. "I
lived in a small second-floor apartment at the corner, and I could look
first on one side and then the other. There was my material."

In Ms. Brooks's early poetry, Chicago's vast black South Side is called
Bronzeville. It was "A Street in Bronzeville," her first poetry anthology,
that attracted the attention of the literary establishment in 1945.

The Bronzeville poems were recommended to the editors of Harper & Row by
Richard Wright, who admired her ability to capture "the pathos of petty
destinies, the whimper of the wounded, the tiny incidents that plague the
lives of the desperately poor, and the problems of common prejudice."

But it was more than Ms. Brooks's ability to write about struggling black
people, particularly black women. There was also her mastery of the language
of poetry.

"Miss Brooks has a command over both the colloquial and the more austere
rhythms," the critic Rolfe Humphries wrote in The New York Times Book Review
about the poems in "A Street in Bronzeville." Calling her "a real poet," Mr.
Humphries said of her technique, "There is a range of form: quatrains, free
verse, ballads, sonnets - all appropriately controlled."

Ms. Brooks said that her reputation was bolstered by a review of
"Bronzeville" in The Chicago Tribune by Paul Engle, a poet and founder of
the Iowa Writers School. Mr. Engle maintained that her poems were no more
"Negro poetry" than Robert Frost's poetry was "white poetry."

Among the poems in "Bronzeville' was "the old-marrieds," a portrait of an
aging couple:

But in the crowding darkness not a word did they say.

Though the pretty-coated birds had piped so lightly all

the day.

And he had seen the lovers in the little side-streets.

And she had heard the morning stories clogged with

sweets.

It was quite a time for loving. It was midnight. It was

May.

But in the crowded darkness not a word did they say.

In "A Street in Bronzeville" Ms. Brooks created such indelible figures as
the old, alienated Matthew Cole, who could only smile at such memories as
"say, thoughts of a little boy licorice-full/Without a nickel for Sunday
School," and Satin Legs Smith, awakening on a Sunday:

He sheds, with his pajamas, shabby days.

And his desertedness, his intricate fear, the

Postponed resentments and the prim precautions.

In 1946 and 1947, Ms. Brooks was awarded a grant from the American Academy
of Arts and Letters and received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation.
In 1949, she published her second volume of verse, "Annie Allen," a portrait
of a Bronzeville girl as a daughter, a wife and a mother, experiencing
loneliness, loss, death and poverty. The critics praised her use of an
experimental form she called the sonnet- ballad. "Full of insight and wisdom
and pity, technically dazzling," Phyllis McGinley wrote in The Times Book
Review.

"Annie Allen" won Poetry magazine's Eunice Tietjens Memorial Prize in 1949
and the following year, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize; Ms. Brooks became
the first black writer to receive the prize since it was established in
1917. She acknowledged that it transformed her life.

"That's why I am as well known as I am today," she said in a 1987 interview.
"Sometimes," she added with a smile, "I feel that my name is Gwendolyn
Pulitzer Brooks."

Ms. Brooks wrote a novel, "Maud Martha," which received scant consideration
when it was published in 1953. "Maud Martha" traced the life of a
Bronzeville woman from childhood to maturity and motherhood through a series
of 34 vignettes.

The reader meets Maud as a lonely, overweight girl of 7, follows her through
a dreamy adolescence and finally sees her as a young newlywed living "in a
sad gray building in a cold white world," married to a man numbed by his
struggle with white society.

But Ms. Brooks's novel was overshadowed by her achievements as a poet and
invidiously compared with Richard Wright's "Native Son" and Ralph Ellison's
"Invisible Man," epic novels with clear-cut socio-political themes. In
recent years, however, "Maud Martha" has had a rebirth, and it is now
regarded in some critical circles as an important forerunner of prominent
themes in the works of today's female writers.

"Bronzeville Boys and Girls," a collection of children's poetry, appeared in
1956, followed by two poetry collections, "The Bean Eaters" (1960) and
"Selected Poems" (1963). Critics noticed that Ms. Brooks's vision was
expanding from considerations of the everyday experiences of Bronzeville to
a wider world that included the murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955
and the racial tensions in Little Rock in 1957.

They also noticed - and most applauded - a sharper colloquial style that was
emerging in poems like "We Real Cool" from "The Bean Eaters":

We real cool. We

By the early 1960's, Ms. Brooks had reached a high point in her writing
career. She was regarded as a grande dame of America's black writers and an
honored member of the literary elite, a sought-after teacher, a poet who was
valued for her sensitive portraits of black women, her precise use of
language and the universality of her work. But by the end of the decade she
had transformed herself and her poetry - a reflection of the new political
dynamics that were sweeping across all the Bronzevilles of America.

Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks was born in Topeka, Kan., on June 7, 1917, but
grew up on the South Side of Chicago, where she remained till she died. Her
parents, David Anderson Brooks and the former Keziah Corinne Wims,
encouraged her and her younger brother, Raymond, to read and take an
interest in culture from an early age.

Gwendolyn began writing poetry before she was a teenager, filling
composition books with "careful rhymes" and "lofty meditations." Her mother
was an enthusiastic supporter, often telling her, "You are going to be the
lady Paul Laurence Dunbar." Ms. Brooks published her first poem, "Eventide,"
in American Childhood when she was 13.

Prompted by her mother, the teenager sent her poems to Langston Hughes and
James Weldon Johnson. Mr. Hughes, who would become her friend and longtime
supporter, wrote back: "You have talent. Keep writing! You'll have a book
published one day." Mr. Johnson also responded with encouragement, urging
her to read such modern poets as Wallace Stevens, e.e. cummings and T. S.
Eliot. By the age of 16, Ms. Brooks had become a regular contributor to the
"Lights and Shadows" column of The Chicago Defender, where many of her
earliest poems appeared.

Three years after her graduation from the newly opened Woodrow Wilson Junior
College in Chicago in 1936, Ms. Brooks married Henry L. Blakely, a young
writer who later published a volume of his own poetry. They lived in Chicago
for the next 30 years, divorced in 1969 but reunited in 1973. Her survivors
include a daughter, Nora Brooks Blakely, and a son, Henry Blakely.

Ms. Brooks's poetry shifted noticeably in form and concern after she
attended a conference of black writers at Fisk University in the spring of
1967. While there she listened to readings by Amiri Baraka, Ron Milner and
other young firebrand poets. "I felt that something new was happening," she
later said.

Those young black writers "seemed so proud and committed to their own
people," she added. "The poets among them felt that black poets should write
as blacks, about blacks, and address themselves to blacks."

She later wrote: "If it hadn't been for these young people, these young
writers who influenced me, I wouldn't know what I know about this society.
By associating with them I know who I am."

Returning to Chicago, she began a poetry workshop in her home that included
members of a Chicago street gang called the Blackstone Rangers and younger
poets like Sonia Sanchez, Don L. Lee and Nikki Giovanni. Much of the talk
was devoted to ways of merging the concept of black art with the political
concept of black power.

These currents were evident in Ms. Brooks's next volume of poetry, "In the
Mecca" (Harper 1968). The 30-page title poem described a mother's frantic
search for her missing daughter in a sprawling, decrepit building called the
Mecca, which once was one of Chicago's fanciest apartment houses.

In a volume that was described by one critic as "her declaration of
independence" from the integrationist pursuit that had previously shaped her
work, Ms. Brooks wrote about the desperate and tragic lives of the
inhabitants of the Mecca. She wrote from experience. Ms. Brooks worked at
the real Mecca as a typist for a "spiritual adviser" when she was young and
got to know the people in the building.

The collection also offered poems about Malcolm X and the Blackstone
Rangers:

Black, raw, ready.

Sores in the city

That do not want to heal.

Ms. Brooks used clipped lines, abstract word patterns and random rhymes to
capture her new radical tone and her more direct expression of social
concern.

"In the Mecca" was nominated for a National Book Award.

Asked if the change in work signaled her emergence as a "protest poet," Ms.
Brooks said, "No matter what the theme is, I still want the poem to be a
poem, not just a piece of propaganda." Ms. Brooks reflected the change in
her 1988 poem "Winnie":

I am tired of little tight-fisted poems sitting down to

shape perfect unimportant pieces.

Poems that cough lightly - catch a sneeze.

This is the time for Big Poems

roaring up out of the sleaze,

poems from ice, from vomit, and from tainted blood.

After the publication of "In the Mecca" Ms. Brooks left her longtime
mainstream publisher, Harper & Row. "Rio" (1969), her next volume of poetry,
was published by Broadside Press, a small, Detroit-based black company. The
change, she said, reflected her desire to support struggling black
publishers and the young poets they published as well as her intention to
address her work to black readers.

With the new direction of her work and the lack of a major mainstream
publisher, however, many of her subsequent books were brushed aside by
reviewers for mainstream publications. From the 1970's to the 1990's, she
published more than a dozen volumes of poetry and nearly a dozen nonfiction
titles, which included two autobiographical works - "Report From Part One"
(1972) and "Report From Part Two" (1995).

Despite the lack of media attention, Ms. Brooks maintained her reputation as
one of America's most respected literary figures. In 1968, she succeeded
Carl Sandburg as poet laureate of Illinois. In 1976, she became the first
black woman to be elected to the 250-member National Institute of Arts and
Letters. She received a lifetime achievement award from the National
Endowment for the Arts in 1989 and another from the National Book Foundation
in 1994. She was the recipient of more than 50 honorary degrees.

The Gwendolyn Brooks Chair in Black Literature and Creative Writing was
established at Chicago State University in 1990, and there is a Gwendolyn
Brooks Center for African-American Literature at Western Illinois University
and a Gwendolyn Brooks Junior High School just south of Chicago in Harvey,
Ill. She was selected by the National Endowment of the Humanities as its
Jefferson Lecturer in 1994 - "the absolute award crown of my career," she
said. And in 1995 she received the National Medal of Arts award.

Despite such praise, Ms. Brooks preferred to stay outside what she called
"the hollow land of fame" and quietly live and work on the South Side.

"All my life is not writing," Ms. Brooks once told an interviewer. "My
greatest interest is being involved with young people." To that end, she
devoted much time to giving readings at schools, prisons and hospitals and
attending annual poetry contests for school-age youngsters, which she
sponsored, judged, and often paid for out of her own pocket.

During her later years, Ms. Brooks tempered her assessment of the young
poets of the 60's who had criticized her subjectivity and attention to form.
"Many of the poets felt it was a mark of their quality, of their black and
Hispanic quality, if they didn't put a lot of emphasis on technique," she
said. Although she still sought to write poetry that was "direct" and
appealed to "all manner of blacks," she insisted on maintaining her own
standards.

"I don't want to imitate these young people," she said. "I have got to find
a way of writing that will accomplish my purpose but still sound
Gwendolynian."

I just heard that Gwendolyn Brooks has died, at age 83, of cancer.

A tremendous poet and person.
Pulitzer Prize winner, author of many books.

I had the honor of meeting her twice, once for what was probably the best
Tucson Poetry Festival ever, in 1987, featuring Gwendolyn Brooks, bpNichol,
and Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, among others. As festival director, I was able
to meet her at the train station (she only traveled by train and auto) and
spend quite a bit of time with her. Later, in Minneapolis, I worked with an
organization that co-sponsored her appearance at Minneapolis Public
Library, where the auditorium held 600 people, but probably 1000 or more
were in attendance, hearing Brooks's reading in the lobby and hallways of
the building.

Her presence and history are compelling, yet it is her language I treasure
most. I took some lines from her poem, "The Second Sermon on the Warpland,"
as the epigraph to a long poem in my book, Hopeful Buildings. I'd like to
repeat those lines here.

        Salve salvage in the spin.

        stylize the flawed utility;

                        Gwendolyn Brooks,
                        from "The Second Sermon on the Warpland"

tru enuf, mayhew, but
the really funny thing is that I first encountered Baudelaire soaps through
a sale notice at a Wild Oats supermarket in California (what thots i have
of u tonite) --the "wild card" announced a special on "Baudelaire
Wilderness Soap".  I took the card and had it for several years in a folder
in which i kept artifacts of poetry n mass culture --which i've since lost,
goshdarn it all, after a presentation to a group of high school teachers.
*Inner* wilderness perhaps, but i always thot of CB as the urban type...
concrete jungle, etc.  it was my favorite such artifact because of the
crazy incongruity of juxtapositions.  i was disappointed to see, while
doing my holiday shopping online at sephora.com, that Baudelaire no longer
stocks a "wilderness soap."

[O.K. -- I made up that first one, but this one is real.  I just heard him say it from his Texas ranch.  By the way, wasn't that a TV I saw in the shot behind the unholy crew, having been told all week by his retainers that W. didn't watch any TV up at the ranch?  But maybe it was put in the shot instead of flags -- an appeal to our real national symbol.)

*PROVE* it?  Eck.  Perhaps the very request of the need for proof is proof
itself.  Fiction readers need proof.  Perhaps lovers of poetry don't; love
is proof itself of love.  irrational, isn't it?

besides novels have been around 'bout 500 years, and always seem to be
restricted to some sort of anti-hero.  novels often "waste" words.  poetry
has been around a long time.  poetry is not restricted to certain types of
characters or characters at all.  i suppose one could take collections of
poetry and turn them into novels or novellas, but i think the other
direction (novel into poetry) would involve some heavy editing and
reconstruction, at the very least.

And you and your friends seem to be leaving out dramas.



My mother asked during Thanksgiving dinner what the point of poetry was
anyway, why anyone "needed" it.  Looked at me, mr poet.  looked at my
mother-in-law, an english lit instructor.  I just laughed.  Mom never
received an answer and the subject smoothly changed.

Being in Chicago with her for many years, Paul and I came to know her.
She was an honest and generous person and always gave her time and money
to encourage young writers.  We'll miss her.

My favorite post-campaign joke is from David Letterman.  He says, "the good
news is that the White House is offering George W. Bush intelligence
briefings."  And then: "sometimes these jokes just write themselves."

3 PLAYS BY BARBARA GUEST

Port (1964)
The Office (1960)
Often (2000)

Directed by Kevin Killian & Wayne Smith
Stage Design by Laurie Reid
With: Rupert Adley, Elliot Anderson, Taylor Brady, Norma Cole, Kota Ezawa,
Phoebe Gloeckner, Craig Goodman, Marisa Hernandez, Cliff Hengst, Scott
Hewicker, Brenda Hillman, Andrew Joron, Kevin Killian, Karla Milosevich,
Yedda Morrison, Tanya Hollis, Rex Ray, Laurie Reid,Jocelyn Saidenberg, Wayne
Smith

Barbara Guest is the author of Defensive Rapture, Fair Realism, Stripped
Tales, Selected Poems, Herself Defined: The Poet HD and Her World, Quill
Solitary Apparition, and three new books--The Confetti Trees, Rocks on a
Platter, and If So Tell Me. With the artist Laurie Reid she has written a
new book for Kelsey St. Press called Symbiosis.

Less well known is her work for the theater. To help celebrate her eightieth
birthday, and her eternally modern spirit, we are reviving two early one act
plays, "Port" (1964) and "The Office" (1960). For this occasion La Guest has
written a new play, "Often," with Kevin Killian-a sort of sequel to "The
Office."

"Port" is a pastiche of Agatha Christie country house mysteries: a titled
Uncle, a bewildered heroine, a bottle of poisoned port, a wicked
Rebecca-like haunting, a coroner's jury, and the mystery that lies beyond
human recall. "The Office" might have been written for "The Twilight Zone,"
as a trio of cynical
cut-throat executives scheme and plot their way to the top, and a mysterious
trio of female secretaries give the signal, like Mme. Defarge, for their
eventual death by firing squad. "Often" brings the characters of "The
Office" into the year 2000, the race for big bucks, office creep, dot.com
millionaires and the search for a better hair conditioner..

1. Poetry is better than truth.

2. Truth is stranger than fiction.

3. Anything that is better than something that is stranger than another
thing is also better than that other thing than which the something that it
is better than is stranger.

4. Poetry is better than fiction.

Glad to be of help.

Aaron. The answer is stunningly obvious.  Fiction (by which I presume you
mean novels by Michener or Mills & Bloom or Ulyssees by A.L.T. J. Goldsmith
and other twaddle) is composed (nowdays - I mean since 1990 ) by computers,
because the author became exhausted and decided to die. The trouble was, as
Bart  pointed out, people were getting it too easy. No one had to look up
dictionaries and everyone (that is all the fiction readers - a breed who
should be immediately despatched (or sent to "retraining schools for the
dull"))  - were becoming immensely lassitudinous and torpid in both manner
mien and mind. Cormac McCarthy is an KLX Z56745 Gotha-Descripta Generator
(Mark 5 if my memory fails not to elude me) and many of those young, vibrant
writers who have BFA s or BDs or DDBs etc are in fact clones. Its well known
(amongst the cognoscenti) that Thomas Pynchon is not Thomas Pynchon at all,
but that his writings are an off-shoot of an experiment done by...well it
involved various clandestine groups it would be safer I failed to
mention...and that he himself does not, and has never, existed. His novels
are so vast and prolix that on turning to say page 678978 after 678000 or
page 56 after page 55, one is completely baffled as to what  was implied on
the initial page. But in fact, all one needs to know about any fiction (of
any kind) is that it has a plot, some decription, a beginning, and usually,
an end (as Forster brilliantly enumerates in his Attitudes of the Novel). In
the middle part various things happen (which can be predicted by a
computer).
  Poetry, like philosophy, is un computible, and digs deep into the eternal
psychic and psychologic centre of all human and non human experience. Its
inviolable and eternal and forever totally ambiguous.Its flowers and pepsi
and blood and apple juice. Its Bart walking into a bread van. It's God. Its
a shout in the street. Its tripe exulted to the highest layer. Its meaning
or its greatness is its absolute lack of meaning. It means itself. (Rap your
friends on their tediously metaphorical knuckles as you pronounce this). But
I wont go on, because, my dear young man, people who read fuction are
incorrigible twaddle ingestors and you should not count them amongst your
friends.
 Yours affuctionately, Richard Taylor.

This from Somerset Maugham, a novelist:

The crown of literature is poetry.  It is its end aim.  It is the sublimest
activity of the human mind.  It is the achievement of beauty and delicacy.
The writer of prose can only step aside when the poet passes.

please forward this call for essays to interested parties you might know:

EXHIBITION UNDER CONSTRUCTION: After Arcades

EXHIBITION UNDER CONSTRUCTION seeks to distractedly put on view--through unique
methods of display--a flash of ideas inspired by Benjamin's <The Arcades
Project>.  We invite previously unpublished works that delve into the
peripheral, the sensual, the historical, the distracted, and the everyday.  The
editors of this proposed volume are working under the premise that the
traditional or standard academic volume of 15-20pg. prose essays is no longer
solely capable of containing (or putting on view) works produced after the
radical epistemological break that is Benjamin's <Arcades>.  Instead, this
anthology will serve as a forum/gallery for experimental works incorporating a
wide variety of forms--from the feuilleton, photo-montage, trash, historical
essay, single sentence, ficto-criticism, postscript and archival collage to the
annotated bibliography, dream inscription, documentary poem, "empire vignette",
and ethnography of distraction.  Nervous, performative, sentient, visual,
transient, poetic and overdetermined works are particularly welcome.

Potential contributors are asked to examine the editors' two previously
co-edited volumes--these suggest the range and poetics of submissions presently
sought:  <Performing Hybridity>, May Joseph and Jennifer Natalya Fink, editors,
(University of Minnesota Press, 1999); and <Visit Teepee Town: Native Writings
after the Detours>, Diane Glancy and Mark Nowak, editors, (Coffee House Press,
1999).  Other possible prototype collections include <Encyclopedia Acephalica>,
Georges Bataille et al (Atlas Press Reprint, London, 1995); back issues of the
journal <Xcp: Cross-Cultural Poetics> (http://bfn.org/~xcp); POL(E)TICS:
documenta X-the book (Cantz Press); Anyone Series (MIT Press); Zone Books;
<Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean>, Translated by Michael
Richardson and Krzysztof Fijalkowski (Verso, 1996);<Mimesis and Alterity>,
Michael Taussig (Routledge, 1993); etc.

Submissions for <EXHIBITION UNDER CONSTRUCTION> should be sent to both editors,
at the
addresses below, by September 1, 2001.  Please include current c.v., e-mail
address, and SASE with your submission.  Send work to:

Here's one: "Poetry is sometimes better than fiction."

seriously, this is purely subjective...you seem to be desiring some objective

One more thing.

The continued attacks on Conservative persons and institutions by members of
this community, as if it were mere sport, divides and alienates, it rivens
society and poisons the common spring of language.  It is a bullying
behavior because it does not permit a comeback from the other quarter.  Your
wits drive full blast down one way streets and run over pop up targets again
and again.  The use of "thugs" to describe people like Mrs. Rice, a
professor at Stanford, is simply shameless.  Shame on you, Ron Silliman.
You really don't know the quality of person you insult.  Shame.

Tell them that the Canadian poet George Bowering said: "Poetry is, in
90% of instances, way to hell and gone better than your damned
fiction!"

POETRY CENTER 2000
The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

The George Oppen Memorial Lecture
in Twentieth Century Poetics
SUSAN THACKREY
Thursday, December 7, 7:30 pm, $5 donation
@ the Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)

Please join us for the Poetry Center's final event of its Fall 2000 series.

George Oppen, talking about his work, once said:

"I was in those books speaking of Being. . . . I was sure I had said Being."

SUSAN THACKREY this Thursday evening will address the heart of Oppen's
practice as a poet.  The Poetry Center's invitation to Ms. Thackrey to
deliver the 16th annual George Oppen Memorial Lecture was met with a sense
of profound anticipation by those who have followed her writing and
thinking around matters of poetry, history, consciousness, and the
contemporary world.  A thinking poet, with a lyric intelligence of a high
order, her work brings to the fore all the qualities we've come to
associate with the writings of George Oppen.  One of the original students
in the inaugural poetics program at New College of California in the early
'80s, and currently a practicing analyst, Susan Thackrey is the author of
the book of poetry _Empty Gate_, and has published essays on a variety of
writers and subjects.  She lives in San Francisco.

"Generosity, responsibility, integrity, vision,
all wrapped up in one-Oppen would say _amen_.."

Arts-Hotel Tax Fund of the City of San Francisco, the California Arts
Council, the National Endowment for the Arts, Poets & Writers, Inc., and
The Fund for Poetry, as well as by the College of Humanities at San

Matt Fowler organized a rather eclectic poetry CD showcasing Lawrence
poets.  It's quite a diverse bunch.  But Ken Irby is on it, and
slightly over 3 minutes of Irby reading (including his poem for Ed
Dorn) is almost certainly worth the $12 (including shipping and
handling) that the folks in charge are asking for it.

More information can be found at http://www.poetsof.lawrence.ks.us/.
Most of the links aren't up yet, but the crucial one (click on GET
IT) is.

Poets should note that at Geeklife.com people are writing movie reviews in
words consisting of three letters or fewer.  They call it "Mad Ape Den". It
is an odd game, but terribly fun.  After all, "If you can not say it in one
or in two (or in one and two) why say it at all?"

One I did:


*****


"The Legend of Bagger Vance"


In WWI, it was so sad to see a U.S. kid to go to war, to see him say "bye"
to his gal (she was hot). He did not die, but he had a bad go of it.  As he
got out, he was mad as a cat-- he saw a gun go off, a gun go off, and off,
and off. He was ill.

So now he's in the U.S. to hop off the bus.  His gal has a lot to say. Yet
he can not hug her or say "hi"; he is too sad and ill. So she is off--mad at
him!

Ten go by; it is now the era of the bad Dow ('29 or so?). The kid-cum-man is
now a bum, a man of gin and ale. His ex is yet so hot. She has a job in the
tee biz -- it is her own biz!  You see, her Dad (now in sod) had a lot. Now
she has big fun: a big tee-off in the sun.

The kid (her ex) did hit OK, but it was ten or so ago. So now -- is it her
way to ask him to tee off? Yes, it is. And it is his way to say, "Wow. OK."
But now he is bad, can not hit. He can not hit his own ass. His hit is way,
way off.

So Bag is in to put it as it was. A man of wit, he say "do dis" and "do dat"
so the kid can hit the tee OK. Is Bag a guy or a god? Now the kid is not ill
from war, and not a rum sot!  He can not win the tee-off, but he can win his
gal. The kid and his ex are OK now.  And at the end, he and she go the way
of man and gal (hot sex).

It was an OK pic. But I was sad the kid had to sit as a bum and rot from '19
to '29 or so. She did not go to him at all?? He did not go for a dip, get a
job? I do not buy it. Why did he not see a doc? Did he ask his dad? No! Why
not?

So, to say it was OK is not to say "Yes, see it."  It's not a pic to see.

Thanks for all your support-----  here is my own view on 'fuction', for
those of you who may disagree ----

[this is one of the emails I sent to my novel-loving friends]



I don't like the "long prose story" form much, but I'll give it its triumphs
-- certainly the great Russian novels, definitely Melville, Flaubert,
Dickens, Proust. Maybe George Eliot, Victor Hugo, I don't know.  I've only
read a handful of such novels.

My problem is not individual successes or failures in the form; it is that I
don't like fictional prose *as a literary mode*.  In most novel-reading
experiences, I don't like the feeling that I feel like I'm playing pretend,
that I'm being set up:

"Okay, here we are in the outskirts of Omaha, Nebraska. Okay, this little
doll is Tom Smith. He's a tall, gaunt insurance salesman. He's sad because
his wife left him. He's middle class, lives beyond his means. And this one
over here is Jane Richards. She is a lesbian librarian, keeps to herself
mostly. You'd be surprised, though-- she might just talk some sense into Tom
Smith at some point in this novel -- but we'll just have to wait and see,
won't we!"

So things begin to unfold, and the plot gets twisty (who could guess?) and
then things all kind of come to a head, and then the cloud breaks and life
settles back to normal -- but somehow we've learned something?  We've
learned that we're all in fact *human* after all, and there's more to life
than meets the eye?  That there's hope?  Blecch.

IN GENERAL, I don't like this sort of fry for two reasons:  (1) It requires
extended suspension of disbelief in a theatrical way, but it doesn't have
the living presence or brevity of theater.  (2) It is rarely as immediately
(inherently) artful as plays and poetry.

Robert Creeley wrote: "A poetry denies its end in any descriptive act, I
mean any act which leaves the attention outside the poem. Our anger cannot
exist usefully without its objects, but a description of them is also a
perpetuation. There is that confusion--one wants the thing to act on, and
yet hates it. Description does nothing, it includes the object--it neither
hates nor loves."

This is a convoluted quote, but it gets at what I mean:  "any act which
leaves the attention outside the poem."  I can't spend a lot of time reading
something that isn't pretty like crystal in the very structure and shape of
its language, something that relies heavily on description of events and
characters without the tension of hard words.

                    Meditation on Fiction Poetry and Metals

1. Poetry is both stranger than and better than fiction and not.

2. Poetry is truth.

3. Fiction is quagmire.

5. Poetry is rose wire.

6. Poetry is intensification mixed with sap.

7. Rilke wrote poetry as did (does) Ron Silliman  and George Bowering.

8. Richard Brautigan wrote "poetic fiction".

9. What is fiction.

9A. Yes!

10. The Universe is a  gland.  Once I wrote: "The cat sat on the mat eating
a bat."

11. Heidegger wrote some poems.

12. There are a lot of strangenesesses.

14. Silence is a form of poetry.

15. Listen.

16. Listen to the Universe.

17. Speak to a stone.

18 Eventually you will become everything: there will be no need
for anything.

19. Words. (Study them with a microscope.)

20. When we are infants, we see people's (especially our mother's) face, but
the deepest thing is their, or her, voice.

22. Switch everything off and listen to yourself.

24. John Cage.

25. Read poems aloud. Read fiction aloud. Also read silently. Soon you will
realise that all writing is beautiful. Every word is a drop of god's blood.

25A.  Music is fatal.

25B. David Antin. I like: "Tallking at the Boundaries."

26. Poetry is fatal. Abandon music. Study each word. "Conglomerate incision
to petal petrol". Thus: "Each word is conglommerate petrol fatal to sepal
study the abandon whose incision is music."

28. Journalists are the worls's greatest poets as are children.

29. Fiction is fortunate forgetting.

29A.                  No!         Yes!

30. Go away where there are no people and prove to a bug that "all things
must be remembered, everything, even the murder of a spider."

40. Listen and try to remember.

50. Listen.

55. Affirm.  Be firm (or soft, if you wish).

60. You are a poem.

60A. Geology is another form of poetry as is mathematics.

70. A gigantic white brain flowered above the horizon.

80. The most beautiful poetry is fiction.

80. Fiction is poetry and everything is (or can be) beautiful or horrific.
What if you could disconnect everything in the universe and then re build
it.

85. What is fiction.

86. No!

90.  The truth has never been known to quarrell with itself.

100.  Here is a poem for a young man:

                               she

                 she is beautiful
                 as a flame
                 leaping
                 from some unfound
                 and carnal blue -
                 and the flame flower,
                 being free, flows
                 like a silk wind, and:
                 she is everywhere everything

102.     Here are some "unpoetic" poems:

                       into miniature silence
                       makes cracked, static

104                drip to harmonic, not unit

105.      Are 104 and 105 poems.  What is a poem. What is a poem what is a
poem what is a what is a poem what is a poem. Is a poem. Poem.

100A.  Make your own poem by placing words in any order: go on, I dare you.

Richard Taylor

"Once upon a time, this friend and I lived together in a very small room in
a very large city with big buildings and a big river, and at night or in
the early morning after we had finished working I would talk. I would talk
and talk, and he would doze and doze, and then he would tell me to shut the
fuck up. This happy arrangement continued for a remarkably long time. Once,
however, upon the conclusion of a particularly tricky job, one that had
gone wrong in several ways, as we were walking towards home, I said
something, and my friend went berserk and, after a short interval, went
away, and that was, or had been, the history of our friendship. Now here he
was again. He had arrived near the end of what he referred to as a tour he
had been taking and was much refreshed and was visiting me.
       So.
       So.
       Still up to it, I suppose, he said.
       John is his name.

Writers...
We Want Your Essays!

For P.S.1's
Special Projects Program

Year-round, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center presents a series of works by
emerging artists from around the world.  The Special Projects Program
showcases artists distinguished by the site-specific, process-oriented or
audience-interactive nature of their work.  Every 3 months, 4 new artists
are given a studio on the 2nd floor at P.S.1 . This winter, the artists are
Sharon Hayes and Andrea Geyer, John Pilson, Michael Rakowitz, Marc Lester
Yu, and Haluk Acakçe.

As a component to this Program, P.S.1 would like to invite writers to
contribute essays.  This writing project will be on-going, growing as more
writers submit essays and changing as new artists are featured.  The essays
will be posted on P.S.1's web site at www.ps1.org and displayed in the
galleries.  Select writers will be invited to a Public Dialogue with the
artists.  Selected essays will hopefully be featured in a possible
publication documenting the Special Projects Program.

Writing possibilities include:

a critical essay on a (or several) Special Project artist(s) (specific to
the piece(s) on view)

a creative essay as a reaction to a particular work of art on view in the
Special Projects
(short story, poem )

Submissions should consist of no more than 1 essay of no more than 750
words and a résumé, and will only be accepted via e-mail.  Essays will be
screened (negative reviews are not appropriate for this forum).  The Winter
Deadline is January 14th, 2001.

    She is exhausted. She recites:

comas from daap within; all you saa ls masqua ... skins slide from flesh,
i lose them. i stumble around the stage. i call for you; it is useless.

Qian Xi is currently a student of Hwa Chong Junior College, Singapore,
and is looking forward to turning 18 next year.

1) poetry serves as an intensifier of experience
- prose often includes a great deal of "filler" -
intended to make a novel a novel
2) it is harder to write - look at the collected
works of most poets - they are about the size of
a novel
3) poetry is more (tho not completely) resistant
to the impulse to write for an audience - i find
poetry to offer a greater sense of "overhearing"
than any other form of writing - its commercial
unviability may account for some of this
4) a poem can contain plot and character,
narrative and argument - a novel has a hard time
containing poetry, despite dustjackets always
claiming "poetic" and "lyric" prose - if poetic
and lyric are so grand as to be used as a
marketing ploy, why not simply cut the middle man
and read lyric poems?
5)having poetry on yr shelf is guaranteed to make
you appear to have sophisticated tastes to anyone
that happens to come over to yr house and look at
yr bookshelf - since no one reads it you can say
anything you like about it and who will
contradict you? the same goes for reading poetry
volumes at local coffee shops - memorising just
enough to appear like you know of what you speak
is a highly recommended method of seduction
6)poems are short to read - fun for bus rides,
just before bed, on yr lunch break at work or
jury duty

so aaron - i'd recommend you memorise a bunch o'
poems and recite them to yr friends - if they
love their novels so much, they should be able to
do the same with their favourite novels and short
stories

CAN YOU OR YOUR GROUP SERVE AS AN ORGANIZING
CENTER FOR THE JANUARY 20 PROTEST AT THE
INAUGURATION?

We've heard from people from New York and New Jersey to
Maine, Vermont, Florida, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Virginia,
North
Carolina, Georgia, Texas and more. Wherever you are, find
the organizing center nearest you--and if there isn't one,
set
one up and organize buses, vans and car caravans to get as
many people as possible to DC on January 20.

Serving as an organizing center in your area would mean
working with other people and groups in your city, school,
community, place of worship, union or workplace to bring
people to DC on January 20. Organizing tools are available.
We would list you on the IAC web site as a local contact and
could direct people in your area to you.

Below is a partial list of organizing centers. Email
iacenter@iacenter.org with your local contact info if you or
your group can serve as an organizing center. Information
will
be listed on the IAC and other web sites, and email notices
will
be sent out periodically.

This suggestion forwarded from Anna Everett:

Whereas Craig Waters, earnest spokesman for the Florida Supreme Court, has been the only person in this whole sorry spectacle to betray any signs of character, carrying out his appointed functions with dispatch and great good humor, and whereas millions now look forward to his each appearance before the building as a respite, safe harbor, moment of sanity, and whereas his Aunt Edith had to settle for seeing him on television instead of at her Thanksgiving Day table,

Be it hereby resolved that a Craig Waters website should be established for the benefit of his innumerable fans and well-wishers and

Be it further resolved that the subscribers to the Poetics List, in their capacity as poets, undertake the composition of a suitable poem in his honor.

Literature ... what is happening to literature? Only a year ago, web
writers
were comfortable calling html-code-intensive works hypertext. But now
that term seems lacking, incapable of describing the myriad technical
approaches available and the creative changes which working in a
web-specific medium has wrought. This is what we choose to call lit
[art] ure.

Classic text poetry to hypermedia presentations and points between:  the

For those in the T.O. area.
kevin


Homeless and street-involved youth at SKETCH have produced year 2001
calendars using their art, poetry and writing.  Helped by some
volunteers from the business community and a generous printer, SKETCH
has published these high-quality calendars to raise money.

SKETCH is located in Toronto, and is the only working art studio for
homeless and street-involved youth that is open 5 days a week, Monday
through Friday, from 9:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.  We provide a safe
environment where kids can come, when there is nowhere left.  These kids
are on the street, under the bridges and in squats all over the city.
They want out of the cycle but do not have the skills or resources to
pull their lives together.  SKETCH is a safe place where they can come,
without judgement and where art and poetry are a tool for building -
conversation, lifeskills, conflict resolution - where they begin to see
that they are worth something, that they  have gifts to offer and that
they can make better choices in their lives.

Calendars cost $10 plus $3.50 for postage and handling.  If you're
interested in buying a calendar, please send a cheque to SKETCH, 1087
Queen Street West, Toronto, ON  M6J 1H3.  If you're in town, drop by
during the week to pick up calendars and save the $3.50!  Most of the
money goes to support SKETCH, but a portion also goes to the artists and
poets.

If you want more info, or want to be emailed a graphic of the cover, you
can email SKETCH at sketch@iprimus.ca or phone us at 416.516.5428.  If
you'd like to donate art supplies, let us know, or drop by.  We can
always use 'em.

Thanks,

Patty

"Mrs. Rice" is supporting a candidate who will not allow any openly gay
person to serve in his administration, who refuses to support affirmative
action, who does not respect women's reproductive rights, and who's running
mate's partner tried to wholly dismantle and discredit the NEA, not to
mention that the potential VP did not politically support freeing Nelson
Mandela.  I don't care where she teaches, she has not earned my respect nor
your praise of her "quality."

No , Condoleeza Rice could reasonably be construed as a thug.  It's entirely
fair.  I bet if you found someone representing and heavily profiting off of
strife and genocide in E Timor, look to certain oil companies.  then look at
their boards.  you just might see condoleeza rice's name popping up all over
next to boeing people and lockheed people and suddenly things smell funny.

shame on you, richard.  you really don't know the quality of person you
protect from insult.  REALLY.

I came across her name about two years ago when researching the E. Timor
crisis.  Her name was all over the place in dark corners, and I assure you
that she was not wearing a cape in any instance.

Having said all of that, to withdraw any sense of bipartisan sense of what I
am saying, let me add this:  though the Reagan/GHWB years were nasty on the
humanitarian scale, with six military deployments (>15,000 soldiers
mobilized or remote military assault on another nation, such as bombing),
the Clinton administration has blown that away, with I believe 33 military
deployments.  the clinton administration goes down perhaps as one of the
bloodiest in american history.  look out king leopold.

so
sock-puppet elect with thugs disguised as thugs
or ventriloquist dummy with thugs disguised in neo-lib fascist babble

so ninny-ninny poo-poo.

Richard,

Actually, it was Mr Baker I was thinking off when I used the term thug, tho
Mr Cheney comes equally to mind. I haven't figured out what to make of Mrs
Rice -- she has that "deer caught in the headlights" look every time I see
her on the news, a feature she shares with George W.

Speaking of whom (W, that is), I do have some friends who are members of the
Bush clan & what they say about that whole side of the family is far worse
than anything anyone has posted here, or is likely to.

There is no difference between poetry and prose.  (Sometimes I am
drawn out of lurking in the shadows by a question so compelling I can
no longer resist.)

So, let's challenge the validity of the "traditional or standard academic
volume of 15-20pg. prose essays,"  but make sure you enclose a c.v. to
prove you have the traditional or standard academic credentials. Wonder
what Benjamin's c.v. looked like.

As a fiction writer, who is married to a poet, who publishes poetry and who
has more poets than fiction writers for friends, I've enjoyed the responses
to the query on proving that poetry is better than fiction, and tend to
agree with them, especially with Maugham's take on it, and rather dig that
business about me (as a post 1990s fiction writer) being dead or a clone
and that my novel was written by my computer (an Imac to be precise).
Having said that, I'll pit my Making of the Americans, Ulysses, Beckett's
Trilogy, Wittgenstein's Mistress, End of the Story and Rings of Saturn
against all your pure form cut-to-the-chase blah blah poetry is better
stuff anyday.

Best Wishes, Poets,

Subject: Save NPR!

On NPR's Morning Edition last week, Nina Tottenberg said that if the
Supreme Court supports Congress, it is in effect the end of the National
Publio Radio (NPR), NEA & the Public Broadcasting System(PBS).

PBS, NPR and the arts are facing major cutbacks in funding. In spite of the
efforts of each station to reduce spending costs and stream line their
services, some government officials believe that the funding currently going
to these programs is too large a portion of funding for something which is
seen as not worthwhile.

The only way that our representatives can be aware of the base of support
for PBS and funding for these types of programs is by making our voices
heard. Please add your name to this list and forward it to friends who
believe in what this stands for.

This list will be forwarded to the President and the Vice President of the
United States. This petition is being passed around the Internet. Please add
your name to it so that funding can be maintained for NPR, PBS, & the NEA.

HOW TO SIGN & FORWARD: IT'S EASY: Please keep this petition rolling.

Do not reply to me. Please sign and forward to others to sign.  If you
prefer not to sign, please send to the E-mail address indicated below.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT DUPLICATES. This is being forwarded to several people at
once to add their names to the petition. It won't matter if many people
receive the same list as the names are being managed. This is for anyone
who thinks NPR/PBS is a worthwhile expenditure of $1.12/year of their taxes.

If you sign, please forward on to others. If not, please don't kill it send
it to the Email address listed here:

<<wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu>>
<<kubi7975@blue.univnorthco.edu>>


****If you happen to be the 150th, 200th, 250th, etc., signer of this
petition, please forward a copy to: wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu

This way we can keep track of the lists and organize them. Forward this to
everyone you know, and help us to keep these programs alive.

Thank you! NOTE: It is preferable that you SELECT (highlight) the entirety
of this letter and then COPY it into a new outgoing message, rather than
simply forwarding it. In your new outgoing message, add your name to the
bottom of the list, then send it on.

there's a letter from clayton eshleman in this issue complaining about
(among many other things) Erik Belgum's and Gary Sullivan's"Critical
Issues" column.  I would like to say that this column is one of the bright
lights of my life (how pathetic); the only thing that irks me is that i,
myself, personally, have never been satirized in it --that i know of.

AMAZON.COM GIVES THE BOOT TO DAY 2 MEMBERS IN LUNCHROOM
Action Likely Violates Federal Labor Law

In what is likely a violation of standard U.S. labor law, four Amazon.com
customer service workers were kicked out of the company cafeteria today for
setting up and staffing a table that openly supported the union drive
underway
in the companys Seattle customer service department.

Dave Norris, who is the Seattle Site Manager for Amazon.coms customer
service
department, quickly put a stop to the employees activity by reportedly
telling
the union supporters that their efforts violated the companys
non-solicitation
policy because they had set up a booth.  The union supporters then
questioned
Mr. Norriss interpretation of the policy; asked for more documentation; and
also
pointed out other flyers in the cafeteria that promoted other non-work
related
activity such as local music shows.  We asked him if these other materials
constituted a "booth," and he said yes, and that he was disposing of
them.  These types of flyers are very common in our lunch room and no one
has
ever confiscated them to my knowledge, said Day 2 organizer Zach Works, who
was
staffing the table at the time of the incident.

Day2/WashTech(CWA) responded immediately by contacting CWA legal counsel and
subsequently sending a letter to Amazon.com management demanding that the
company either correct and apologize for managements behavior or be subject
to
further legal action.

        I don't see any point in comparing the two.

        As long as they function well and are useful--does one ask of
        one's legs or eyes or ears which is the better one of the two?

        There is a famous story of Dylan Thomas being introduced to a
        Professor of Comparative Literature and saying:

        "What do you compare it to?"

We invite submissions on the following topics:
Text vs. Image: The Relationship between Literature and the Visual
 Arts ; Since the age of manuscript illumination, the history of text and
image has been one of cross-fertilization, intervention and sometimes
opposition. The visual arts modeled their creations on literary motifs,
while texts resorted to imagistic modes of representation. Translating
text into image and image into text, various artistic movements have used
one as a means to enhance or critique the other. We welcome papers that
deal with the following questions: How have the visual arts influenced
literary forms? How have works of literature been adapted for
representation in painting or on film? Has the shift from mechanical
reproduction to digital representation had an effect upon reading or
writing?

Cinematic Memory: The Return of History as Film?
Cinema has a particular status in the creation (and suppression) of
public memory. Whether documentary or fiction, filmic images shape common
understandings of history and sometimes become indistinguishable from
lived experience. In Germany, this has been particularly critical. UFA
was instrumental in Nazi propaganda efforts, while in the Adenauer era,
/Papas Kino/ aided in the process of forgetting. Many DEFA films rewrote
recent German history in terms of an anti-fascist struggle. Problematic
historical memories resurfaced in the West in the 1970s in a wave of
&quot;Nazi retro&quot; films and television programs. Current cinema is a
prime location for remembering the GDR. We seek papers on the
representation of historical events through film, and papers describing
how films reflect historical moments and preserve memory.

Imag(in)ing National Identity
Even before the birth of the modern nation state, images were used
to delineate what was supposedly German. Today, visual depictions of
national culture continue to form an integral part of how Germany,
Austria, and Switzerland imagine their own communities. How has the use
of the image developed alongside the growth and transformation of
national identity? How have artists, writers, and public personas helped
shape notions of what is German? How does art help construct national
culture, and what makes works of art German or
Austrian & the artists nationality, the subject matter, the
circumstances of its creation? Papers dealing with all aspects of
national identity and the visual are welcome.

Denn Man Sieht Nur Die im Licht/: Power and Representation
From medieval ceremonies of public acclaim, visual Reformation
propaganda and the strategems of absolutist rulers to the twentieth
century advertising industries and propaganda machineries, the politics
of seeing and being seen play a central role in cultural and political
history. Public displays increase the visibility of governing agencies,
suggest a look at the governed and reiterate authority, but can also
powerfully subvert established authority. We invite investigations on the
representational strategies used to confer or contest and finally
implement power, as well as how they influence or structure the public
sphere.

Art from the Ashes? Visual Representations of the Holocaust
From Claude Lanzmann's Shoah to Roberto Benini's Life is
Beautiful, from the establishment of memorials in Germany and Austria to
the construction of Holocaust museums, visual representations of the
Holocaust continue to stimulate discussion and controversy about history,
memory and the role of art in the depiction of catastrophe. Not only
German-language documentaries and dramatizations, but also painting,
sculpture and architecture have raised questions about the merits of the
visual in representing an event which, it is argued, can never be
depicted. We welcome papers raising issues about how artists have either
come to terms with, avoided, or transcended the events of the Holocaust.

Forme Menschen nach Meinem Bilde: The Image-Making Industries
Presenting audiences with an ideal Other, delineating forms of
desirability and cultivating need, the culture industry has decisive
influence on the identity formation of individuals and social groups. We
are looking for contributions addressing issues related to the
image-making industry, such as: its effect on politics; the market of
supply and demand; public icons and their function; the impact of the
advertising industry on contemporary culture; the role of television; the
operation of film distributors; the role of new media such as the
internet; how different media contribute to or counteract social and
political marginalization; forms of resistance against the major
commercial and governmental image-making industries (if any), and their
effectiveness.

Open Topic
We welcome abstracts on further topics within the area of German
Studies.
Submissions by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows are
welcome.
Blind submission is requested; please send abstracts with title
only, and include name and address on a separate sheet.

A friend of mine, a criminal defense lawyer, wrote to me recently about the
first audio tapes emanating from the Supreme Court regarding the events in
Florida:

"For years, I've heard how Scalia is so smart, and finally I get to hear him
and pass judgment, my own.  He is a pedantic nominalist (that is, a person
whose search for meaning looks at the actual words as some kind of positive
and objective marker of meaning and truth).  What he resists is the notion
that truth is in the mind and can be read between the lines.  But he is
right to distrust the mind, at least his own, because he is a classic son of
working class Italian immigrants who courtesey of the Univ of Chicago has
been given the opportunity to play The Prince.  However, unlike Machiavelli,
this old buddy of Bork has class anxiety."

He went on to describe Justices Kennedy and O'Connor in slightly more
scatalogical terms. But something seemed off to me in his definition of
nominalism, so today -- having read the latest Scalia pronouncements -- I
went to the OED. Nominalism is that philosophical belief that says there are
no universals outside the mind, that any reality exists only because we say
so, by giving it a name -- it's opposed to realism, which says there IS such
a reality outside the mind.

So perhaps, in the quote above, the weight should be given to "pedantic" not
"nominalist." Is Justice Stevens' dissent, bulwarked by so many examples of
precedent Florida law, "realist"?

While it's certainly true that one person's definition of irreparable harm
is another's idea of horseshit, I wonder if these dusty philosophical
positions are still operative in today's poetics. Most poets (thinking out
loud here) would seem to be natural nominalists, in that our words are used
for temporary effect in the poems at hand, and wouldn't necessarily have any
universal meaning outside that particular poem. I remember hearing, years
ago, that Newton didn't discover gravity as much as he invented it -- to
which some part of my being enthusiastically assented. But Henry Gould, as I
remember, has expressed several times his belief in an external reality
beyond "all this fiddle" . . .

Are these issues for anyone else?

Joe

i do realize i am beating my own bush (____ing my own _____?) here, but I do
think it's a great issue, Jennifer.

while there are some omissions (Jim Andrews comes to mind) I think it
signals a major wind shift in the 'poetry/art/net' world - there have of
course been some breezes and gusts of this elsewhere recently - webart or
whatever it might be called is now the over-riding paradigm along with image
in it's many senses and histories.

I'm so glad there are other fans of the inimitable Mr. Waters!
Though I confess to having something of a thing for Mr. Boies, as well, at
least for his syntax (if W. had 1/10 of 1/10 of 1 percent of it, we'd all be
better off).
As for poems, I'm enjoying Claudia Keelan's Utopic, Lyn Hejinian's Happily,
Liz Waldner's Call.

Beauty Queens and the Capitalist Beast.     By Vijay Prashad

All the men are computer programmers, all the women are beauty
queens, and some of us are humorless. So it seems in the land of
Silicon(e) India. Bill Gates says that Indians are the second
smartest people on the planet, and the international consortium of
Beauty Contests deems Indian women to be the most beautiful. Gates
wants us to work in his computer monopoly, so he flatters us with
technical complements. The megaliths that salivate before the Indian
market (the size of France, we are told eagerly) complement
the Indians by saying that we too should overconsume nonsense that
makes us look like our Beauty Queens. The H1B visa quota has been
increased to 300,000 per year, to encourage more of us to apply to
work as cyber-coolies.

Simultaneously, Lara Dutta won the Miss Universe title (May),
Priyanka Chopra won the Miss World crown (November), and Diya Mirza
took home the Miss Asia Pacific honors (December). Flattery opens
markets and encourages labor to toil along in the service of a
benevolent white supremacy.

Beauty Pagents have a long history in the US, but their role as
the purveyors of overconsumption on the international stage is less
well known. Founded right after World War II, the Miss Universe
pageant is the junior partner to the Miss World contest. The latter
was created by Eric and Julia Morley in 1951 as a promotional device
for Mr. Morley's company, Mecca, which is what he called a 'leisure
group' (travels, entertainment, etc., all at a high price). In 1970,
Mrs. Morley coined the phrase 'Beauty with a Purpose' and they took
what was essentially a parochial British television event to the
world stage.

The Miss Universe contest, in comparison, was much smaller and has
remained far less prestigious until CBS television and Donald Trump
took over the enterprise in late 1996. Before the early 1990s, the
Miss Universe pageant was as 'Universal' as the US
baseball championships that are called the 'World Series.' CBS-Trump
took the pageant into the age of neo-liberalism, in direct
competition with the UK's Miss World. It is funny, therefore, to hear
Trump on the contest: =93there is nothing to compare with the Miss
Universe Organization. We have a rich history of bringing together
some of the most impressive, beautiful and interesting women from
many backgrounds and cultures and then helping them achieve their
goals.=94 Miss World makes the same claims.

With the fall of the Berlin Wall, US capital and its media outlets
have been on a global binge. The reach of the US (and Australian,
viz. Murdoch) media is now quite long and there is a move from many
of these outlets to extend their market share in places like India.
CBS-Trump's Miss Universe pageant conceived of something called 'Big
Event Television,' a hugely promoted event that draws a large
audience who will then be turned-on to ancillary programs through
expensive advertisements. There are a host of promoters who sign-up
eagerly to show their products to a world for which these
pageants have become something of an opiate, the Bread and Circuses
of current capitalism.

It took the structural adjustment of India (from 1991) to bring forth
the crowns of beauty onto the svelte elite women of India. After all,
Indian models are no strangers to the winner's circle at the
pageants. In the Miss World pageant, the first Indian model to win
was Reita Faria in 1966. Six semi-finalists and finalists ('70, '72,
'75, '78, '80, and '91) followed her. At the lesser Miss Universe,
six semi-finalists and finalists ('66, '72, '73, '74, '90, and '92)
forged the path for Sushmita Sen's victory in 1994.

But the victories have come fast and furious in the 1990s. In
1994, Sen and Aishwarya Rai won both pageants. Since then, the Miss
World pageant has been won by Diana Hayden (1997) and Yukta Mookhey
(1999); in 1996, an Indian model was a finalist. On the Miss Universe
side, Indian finalists and semi-finalists have stood nervous until
the final stages of the contest each year (1995-1999) until the clean
sweep this year. The 1990s did change the tempo, perhaps to let us
know that global firms wish to project to the Indian consumer a
vision of beauty, the advance guard not only for beauty products, but
also for the entire consumer goods industry (the creation of desire
transforms luxuries into necessities).

Not only is this good for the global firms, but it is also something
that is enjoyed by bourgeois nationalists. Sushmita and Aishwarya
saved India from the Surat plagues and riots of 1994. Now Lara Dutta
saves India from the drought. Foul images of the Third World are
erased by doctored images of radiant women. Reality can be easily
occluded by big event television. After Ms. Dutta's victory, Femina's
editor Sathya Saran wrote in <The Economic Times> that 'today,
reality has overreached the dreamI The country is proud, happy. But
not surprised.' Utter drivel. The country is still in the midst of a
drought that effects 100 million people, at the very least. And most
of the 'country' had no idea that this graduate of St. Xavier's
(Mumbai) spent the last three weeks in war-torn Cyprus as part of a
campaign to revive the tourist industry on that island (Cyprus spent
$7 million on the effort).

One reason feminists and other leftists across the world are unhappy
with the pageants is that they act as a screen against the war
against women conducted by such agencies as the IMF. This is apart
from the issue of the degradation of women by the pageants (the
reduction of woman to mere body, etc.). In Nicosia, protests outside
the basketball stadium (decorated like a Greek amphitheater) ensured
that we not forget the trials of the world as we celebrate this
shallow kind of universalism. A banner proclaimed that 'we want
schools and hospitals,' knowing full well that there are choices to
be made in the world and a victory for India at the pageant does
little, for example, for its enduring crisis of education and health.
One Cypriot woman dressed in rags and carrying black garbage bags
told the press that 'I'm a teacher and we have to beg for handouts
and we are wasting money here on this pageant. Why?' Indeed, why?
Simply to promote a set of values (consumerism) that seem to be far
more important to contemporary capitalism than social justice and
ethical conduct.

The protests put the pageant on notice. For this reason, the final
question asked to the contestants was 'what would you say to those
who condemn the contest as an affront to women?' Lara Dutta's answer
appealed to the judges: 'pageants like Miss Universe give us young
women a platform to foray in the fields that we want to and forge
ahead, be it entrepreneurship, the armed forces, be it politics. It
gives us a platform to voice our choices and opinions and it makes us
strong and independent as we are today.' Of course Ms. Dutta is
entitled to her own opinion, but what is of interest is that she
chooses these three options: business, the military and politics.
Money, the Gun (or Nuclear Bomb) and Power.

Of course her father, to whom she dedicated her victory, is in the
Indian armed forces. But one can still muse over these 'choices and
opinions,' especially how divergent this view of the world is from
that of the All-India Democratic Women's Association or of Women's
Initiative for Peace in South Asia (whose recent bus trips
between India and Pakistan are a landmark of people-to-people
diplomacy). " JC=20

David,

My friend - at least on some level - Mumia did it.  So did Gary Grant.  By
Gawd, I wd hv gone down there to Texas and executed him myself!

The DemKrat in me can stand up for someone like Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

But this direction - Mumia? - I live in Pennsylvania and have seen the
report on this guy.  Good grief, am I the only voice in your life that
speaks outside this RadLib belief system that seems to have co-opted your
genius?

You know, the other minorities, new to these shores, look at this sort of
thing - Mumia - and don't stand with you on this.  They are searching for
another way.  And that way is John Birch Republicanism.

Aaron. Actually I like reading all kinds of writing on many subjects. I dont
think there is neccessarily a "better" form. Just as people listen to music
or use music for different occassions or reasons. If they "hate" poetry
you'll never convince them. Some people just simply dont see the point of
it. My brother thinks most modern art is crap but enjoys studying the stars,
solving maths puzzles, and tramping.I've no idea what he thinks of poetry.
Probably would think most modern poetry was "crap". I dont discuss poetry
with people unless I know they are very interested in it.My brother likes
short humorous novels.So do I.  I like poetry and novels. My mother, when I
"broached" the fact that I was now writing poetry said: "I dont like poems"
I think that she meant her experience of poems. She read many novels.  I
have an aquaintance who is quite happy, made 1 million dollars, but can
neither read nor write.What you dont know you dont miss. My son doesnt like
poetry very much - doesnt read hardly at all except Ben Elton and books
about astrology. I have a "mate" who just watches "action" movies on
television. A useful mate as he's a mechanic, and a good man, but would not
have a clue if I read him - well probably any poetry - but lets say
Wordsworth's "Daffodils". A very intelligent woman I know, who has a law
degree, wont listen to one word of poetry. But people can live without
reading, let alone poetry! (But probably not without love of some kind). The
problem is firstly: how to define fiction versus poetry? Can the forms be
separated in every case? Then the question arises, who, except for a few
crazy poets, gives a damn?
  That quote was typical Creeley. Irritatingly interesting, but almost
incomprehensible and rambling... But then again, perhaps one needs a touch
of the "ramble coefficient" to be a poet.
  This I do think. I think that some people are frightened of poetry, or it
makes them feel uncomfortable, confronted. (I say some, most are just not
interested) But I once argued with a journalist (to the effect) that, no,
poetry, was still viable and valid (this was at a poetry competition and
performance night). I think one of the things poetry can do is to probe into
certain areas of the psyche or consciousness that even music fails to do -
or it adds to what music and the other arts can do. I refferred to the fact
that, as infants, we first hear our mother's (or father's)  voice (and
others) and as we grow, if we are allowed or encouraged in a relaxed way in
a "good" environment at home or school, poetry can enter into us and enrich
our lives. So can fiction, but fiction is more narrational, more
explicatory, and possibly more complex. Poetry may go deeper into the inner
"inner" of us. But eg Finnegan's Wake - Joyce, I read somewhere, advised
people to read it as a gigantic poem. I heard a recording of Joyce reading
it and it brought F's Wake marvellously alive for me. (But I havent
attempted to read it all or "puzzle it out"). But to get back to my
journalist. She felt that because of movies (arguably at times can be like
visual poems, maybe they become poems?) and television etc had made poetry
irrelevant. Also the interest in music and other "entertainments" had
"diminished" poetry. One of my daughters is not very interested in poetry:
she and her sister are in a group and that's their "buzz" but both
appreciate poetry sometimes. But for a lot of people its some music style
that they seem to "lock onto".
 But I have confidence that there will always be a place for some form of
poetry, however we define it. And I dont think we have to get more complex
than remembering our parents talking to us, reading to us, or singing to us
at an early age. The journalist could not understand the deep significance
of the human voice. The power of voice, its power, how it can or seem to
wound us or soothe us or enchant, or express so many emotions so directly or
so completely. Music too, but would you rather hear someone say: "I love
you" or replace that with a piece of music?  Poetry (and maybe fiction)-
with the human voice ever present, is not better, but its potential power is
virtually eternal. Some of Creeley's poems get into those inner "rooms".
there is a sense in his and certain other poets of a forever seeking. But
I'm getting even more clichaic...

O.K. It has more "functions" than that eg we all know about "readerly" and
"writerly" texts  and thus "language poetry" etc and there's dramatic
poetry, ballads, satire, and so on.

Of course I was trying to be a bit "droll" with my talk of "fuction" but
there's an example. I (as you probably guessed) hit the "u" instead of the
"i" hence I instantaneously invented a new genre: Fuction!The creative error
that leads to a neologism. We poets are "allowed" to neologise, even if  its
by the method of  a million monkeys...   But I didnt really mean to be so
cynical. Silly maybe...

Regards. Best wishes to you and everyone on the List for Xmas. Richard

I disagree. Partly because writing *good* fiction/narrative prose is very
difficult, time consuming, etc. ... and partly because I, a poet, love good
fiction. What is good fiction? In the past few years I've enjoyed reading or
re-reading(off the top of my head in no particular order) The god of small
things, The passion, The bean trees, An unfortunate woman (Richard
Brautigan), Short stories by Graham Greene and John Cheever, ...

But taste aside, I also disagree because I don't see the point in arguing
this "better/worse" sort of dichotomy, especially around genre. I find the
distinction between poetry and prose not only largely useless and irrelevant
but wasteful (except when generating tangents such as  "Meditation on
Fiction Poetry and Metals"). Writers like Carla Harryman, who intentionally
blur and break the rules/boundaries of such distinctions excite me. Like
Hamlet, I prefer to read "words, words, words" -- provided said words have
been placed on the page (or the screen) with some semblance of wit and/or
intelligence.

Back to work,
Laura

from the Introduction

In 1999, I, along with several other poets and writers, was asked to partake
in an online "roundtable" on sexuality and literature.  The event would be
centered around a brief essay by the San Francisco novelist Dodie Bellamy.
The outcome of this roundtable, which would take place entirely through
email, was to be published on the Poetics List that is moderated out of SUNY
Buffalo.  All of the participants were divided into groups, each individual
having a position in that group.  As I was the second in position, I was
assigned to respond to the person in the first position, who in my case was
the poet and feminist literary theorist Rachel Blau DuPlessis.

DuPlessis wrote a very texturally detailed, nearly opaque, response.  I had
decided that I wanted to respond to her text in a detailed manner, but I
felt that normal prose would not suffice on my part, so I alphabetized the
words in her text, and created my own series of very short "concrete" poems
based on the chance meeting of words.  As words invariably take on nearly
obscene meanings when they are left to linger and intermingle on their own,
and as DuPlessis's text was so loaded to begin with, I didn't enjoy the poem
that much.  More importantly, as it was in a sort of antique "concrete"
mode, it resembled a much older aesthetic, one well explored by Gomringer,
the De Campos brothers and numerous others in the past fifty years, and so
it wasn't very interesting to me.

But eventually, fishing for an idea for an extended Flash piece, it dawned
on me that this poem would be perfect.  It would be both traditional and
not, it's tradition being nearly unknown in America, and it would be
entirely concerned with the body in relation to writing and society, hence
avoiding the negatives of much web poetry that seems concerned primarily
with technology and its language.  I decided to limit myself to use the
Arial font (other than letters I created out of lines and circles), to only
use black and white and shades in between, to use no images, and to stick
exactly to my text.  Other than that, it's an improvisation, and like most
improvisations has its knotty, ungracious moments and a few surprises that
seem to make up for them.  At least I hope so... hope you like it.

Subject:      Scalia's Poetics -- Reader Irresponsibility Theroy
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hearing these hearings gives a much clearer view of what "strict construction" and "original intetnt" really mean in these contexts.  In the first hearing, Scalia pronounced his construal the only way that a text could possibly be read.  In the second hearing he pronounced any reading other than his own to be irrational.  Meanwhile, in one of his first interventions, he spoke of the ballots in question being ballots that the machines were not supposed to count.  How does a strict constructionist dedicated to original intent ascertain this without actually looking at one of the ballots?  And is it not passing strange that he takes no notice of the fact that these machines have a published error rate -- which means quite plainly (and if you don't agree you must simply be irrational) that the machines read some votes where they "shouldn't" and fail to read some votes where they "should" --

At least that's how I read it.

It appears that a strict construction is an opinion with the power of the state apparatus lined up behind it -- which is why Scalia's original intent was to install the shrub in the shrubbery no matter what the voters of Florida (who, as he opined in hearing one, have no real right to vote for president anyway) may intend.

What you like or don't is, of course, a matter of taste and I'm not about to
try and talk you out of it but, as a lover of novels from way back, I feel I
should make a few points -

on pretense - perhaps the problem is with narrative ? which also occurs in
poetry and plays, so it hardly seems a point on which to only condemn the
novel. As for the artifice of plot, surely it's a variable
- an historical novel may be grounded on what are believed to be reliably
recorded events
- narratives employing what I'll loosely term a mythic structure operate in
an area where distinctions between the made-up and the real are pretty
irrelevant
- realist novels can employ plots that are resolutely uncontrived
- then there are those novels whose articiality is pure delight, evidence of
imagination and craft well coupled
- novels that eschew plot or anything but fragments of narrative and are as
riveting in their use of language as anything most poets accomplish, I'm
thinking of Ada, an old favourite, but even more of Iain Sinclair's great
monstrosity (I hope there're a few Latin scholars out there)  'Downriver"
which I've just recently read and hope to re-read.
Then there's Beckett and now I'm wondering, not alone in this, how
constructive (or deconstructive) is the distinction between novel and poetry
- clearly there's something we can easily label a novel, just as there's
something we can as easily label a poem but both tend to be the more timid
examples of the species - I'm getting carried away now, sorry, it's the end
of the year, 2 more days till the summer holidays -

As the above (my reply) probably already indicates, I don't think this is an
accurate 'description' of the novel but it's the quotation from Creeley
(above) that's a fair account of many of the best novels (well, all, I
guess) (I don't think the implied comparison between average to poor fiction
with good to great poetry is helpful). The novel may do it (generally but
not always)in different ways to poetry but the best (yes, I'm uncomfortable
with that terminology too) compell attention in the most overwhelming
manner. Nothing less than complete immersion. >

Enough. Although there's more to be said.

Aaron. I was just looking back thru emails and saw your link to the N.Y.
Times about Henry Darger. I saw that also and sent it on to a friend.
 But I'd mised your poems. Just "ran thru" them. Interesting style -
refreshing. Some clever writing there. Not too heavy. But I hope your sister
really didnt get blown away! Regards, Richard Taylor

Here is the odd tale of the man whose work inspired Ashbery's _Girls on the
Run_.  I'm sure some of you have already seen this.

He Was Obsessed With Little Girls and Perhaps He Was a Genius.

September 16, 2000

By SARAH BOXER


He has inspired a book of poetry ("Girls on the Run" by John Ashbery),
fashion designs (by Anna Sui), a British rock band (the Vivian Girls), a
Hawaiian dance ("The Valley of Io"), a video game (Sissy Fight at
www.sissyfight.com), an opera (being composed by Douglas Cuomo), a play
("Jennie Richee" by Mac Wellman, opening in February at the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Chicago) and a movie prospect (now canceled). He has
been compared to Lewis Carroll, Fra Angelico, Andy Warhol, Balthus and Dr.
Seuss. The word "genius" has often been used near his name, but so,
occasionally, have the words "mind of a serial killer." His work has been
called part "Child's Garden of Verses," part "pedophilic fantasy." He drew
tribes of little girls, and gave some of them little penises.

  Henry Darger (1892-1973) spent much of his life in Chicago rummaging
through trash cans, going to Mass, writing about the weather and fighting
with tangled balls of twine. When he died, he left an apartment filled with
hundreds of old Pepto Bismol bottles; plastic maple syrup containers; balls
of string; a windup Edison phonograph; a music box, and plaster figurines of
Jesus and Mary. That was not all.

  "Where there was any wall space, and tacked around every door frame, were
pictures of little girls that had been cut out of magazines, newspapers and
coloring books," Michael Bonesteel writes in "Henry Darger: Art and Selected
Writings," to be published by Rizzoli in November. There were pictures of
the Dionne quintuplets, some 20 pictures of the Coppertone Girl and many
pictures of Little Annie Roonie.

  Two trunks held a lifetime of writing: a 5,000-page, eight-volume work
titled "The History of My Life," which included thousands of pages on a
single tornado; a weather journal covering exactly 10 years, from Dec. 31,
1957, to Dec. 31, 1967; and a series of diaries detailing how many times he
went to Mass and his many tantrums over twine.

  The biggest surprise was a creepy, obsessive 15,000- page manuscript typed
in different colored inks. It was called "The Story of the Vivian Girls, in
What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal of the Glandico-Angelinian Wars,
as Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion." And it had an 8,500-page sequel,
"Further Adventures in Chicago."


  The Vivian girls

Violet, Joice, Jennie, Catherine, Hettie, Daisy and Evangeline are the
heroines of "The Realms." They unite with gentle, child-loving dragons
called the Blengiglomenean Serpents (Blengins for short) in a
four-year--seven-month war (fought sometime between 1910 and 1917 and
roughly following the outlines of World War I) against the Glandelinians, a
race of fallen Catholics who enslave and torture children. In the end, the
girls prevail and so do the Catholic nations of Abbieannia, Angelinia,
Abyssinkile, Protestentia and Calverinia, but not before many children are
tortured and killed.

  If Darger had left only the text, he might be just another forgotten
recluse. But he also made 300 illustrations everything from small
watercolors to 12-foot-long mural-size scrolls, often painted on both sides.

  Darger crammed his huge, fantastical landscapes with baby-faced girls,
some clothed in colorful dresses, bathing suits and pinafores, and others
naked. He equipped certain girls with horns and others with penises; he
showed some being disemboweled or strangled, tongues lolling out, and he
drew others enjoying the sunshine, the butterflies and the huge flowers. The
girls' eyes, as John MacGregor, a pre-eminent Darger scholar, has pointed
out, shine in the dark because Darger filled them in with pencil lead.

  Darger had trouble drawing figures, so he traced or cut and pasted images
taken from comics, children's books and magazines. If they weren't the right
size, he had them enlarged at his local drugstore. The results were
stunning. The Nation's critic Arthur Danto has called Darger "a genius of
stammering achievement." Time magazine's critic Robert Hughes has toyed with
the term "Poussin of pedophilia."

  Darger (pronouced DAHR-gurr) had a rotten childhood. When he was 4, his
mother died while giving birth to his sister, who was put up for adoption.
As a child, Darger was not fond of girls. He "threw ashes in one little
girl's eyes and tried to slash another girl with a knife," Mr. Bonesteel
writes. When he was 8, his father, a tailor, could no longer take care of
him.

  Darger went to live in a Catholic mission. Apparently he was thrown out
for masturbating. He was put in the Asylum for Feeble- Minded Children in
Lincoln, Ill. There he became absorbed with religious rituals. He once
wrote, "I burned holy pictures and hit the face of Christ in pictures with
my fist." At 16 he ran away from the asylum. For the next half-century, Mr.
Bonesteel tells us, Darger worked "as a janitor, dishwasher and bandage
roller at three Chicago hospitals."

  He lived a life of magnificent confinement. The room he occupied had no
kitchen or bathroom, and the great events of his life were meteorological.
He went to Mass as many as four or five times a day. "He would rarely speak
to anyone, but if spoken to would respond politely always about the
weather," his landlord, Nathan Lerner, recalled in a written statement. "He
was a remarkable mimic and sometimes there would be an animated quarrel
going on between a deep gruff voice, which was supposed to be he, and a
querulous high-pitched voice, which was supposed to be his superior, a nun."

  Kiyoko Lerner, the widow of Darger's landlord, remembered that Darger
"would walk around the neighborhood picking through garbage string,
magazines, newspapers, books, anything." He brought everything into his room
and never took anything out. The room was packed floor to ceiling. A narrow
pathway ran from the door to the desk, where Darger both worked and, it
seems, slept.

  In 1972, old and crippled, Darger moved to a place he called Little
Sisters of the Poor, a nursing home in Chicago. He died on April 13, 1973,
and was given a pauper's burial at All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines, Ill.

  Darger's real life, though, was with his Vivian girls. "The first
indication that Darger had stepped across the line between reality and
fantasy happened in the summer of 1912," Mr. Bonesteel writes in his book.
"He dubbed the catalytic event `The Great Aronburg Mystery.' "

  Darger apparently lost a photograph he had cut from The Chicago Daily News
of May 9, 1911, a picture of a murdered child named Elsie Paroubek. In "The
Realms" she became the model for Annie Aronburg, a martyr who is slashed
with a razor and strangled.

  While Darger was obsessed with children in general, he and his only
friend, Whilliam Schloeder, formed a two-man club they called the Children's
Protective Society, he was particularly taken with the photograph of Elsie.
(Mr. MacGregor has suggested that Darger murdered her.) Darger bargained
with God. "If the picture were not returned by a certain time, and he kept
pushing the date farther and farther ahead, he would turn the tide of the
war against the Christian nations," Mr. Bonesteel writes. God did not
respond, and Darger started drawing little girls being massacred by the
Glandelinians.

  At that point, the story became "a blood bath," as Stewart Lee Allen wrote
in a review of a Darger show in The San Franciso Bay Guardian, quoting
Darger's script: "Little girls, from the ages of 9, 8 and even younger, were
tied down stark naked and a spade full of red-hot live coals laid on their
bellies. Scores upon scores of poor children were cut to pieces, after being
strangled to death. . . . Children were forced to swallow the sliced
fragments of dead children's hearts. . . . Their protruding tongues were
extracted."

  The killing did not stop until Col. Henry Darger joined forces with the
Vivian girls. And then, Mr. Bonesteel says, the war quickly ended. Gen. John
Manley, the chief villain of "The Realms," named for a bully from Darger's
childhood, surrendered.

  Darger the artist was saved by one man: his landlord, Nathan Lerner, a
photographer trained at the New Bauhaus in Chicago. If he had not
intervened, the paintings and manuscripts would probably have been
destroyed. "I told him to throw them away," says Mr. Lerner's widow, who
owns the rights to Darger's work.

  Darger became a darling of outsider art. In 1977 his work was shown at the
Hyde Park Art Center. Other shows followed, most of them put on by the
Phyllis Kind Gallery, and most of them linking Darger with outsider art or
Art Brut, a tradition of madness and creativity that went back to painters
like Bosch, Bruegel, Goya and Géricault.

  But Darger's status really soared in 1997, when the Museum of American
Folk Art in New York mounted a show put together at the University of Iowa
by Stephen Prokopoff. Now the Art Brut Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, owns
more than 20 Dargers.

  Mr. Bonesteel is compiling a condensed version of "The Realms." There is
talk of a Darger study center in New York that would include his writings.
And the Intuit Gallery in Chicago is working on a reconstruction of Darger's
room. Jane Kallir, the director of the Galerie St.  tienne in Manhattan,
says, "You can get a very good Darger for $75,000 to $80,000."

  How did this happen? "It is the quality, the magnitude, the crowded
cluttered composition, the unfathomability" of the work, Brooke Anderson,
the director and curator of the Contemporary Center at the Museum of
American Folk Art, says. And of course, she adds, there is "the secrecy, the
privacy." Ms. Lerner says "the size is one thing" that draws people to the
paintings, but it is also that they are "so raw." There is "no hypocrisy" in
them, she says. He was not thinking of an audience.

  Or was he?

  Darger, Mr. Bonesteel suggests, may actually have anticipated an audience
when Annie Aronburg, his character, says "she will have all the battle
manuscripts `published as soon as I can, so the world shall know.' " Darger
noted in his 15,000-page novel that "editors of great experience will in due
time be allowed to go over the whole work most carefully."

  Some people think that Darger even anticipated other artists. His "use of
cut-outs from magazines, comic strips and coloring books prefigures the same
kind of appropriations by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein," Mr. Bonesteel
observes. And Ms. Kallir says: "Darger was an unwitting postmodernist,
though he couldn't have conceived what that was. He saw behind the facade of
mid-century prosperity and propriety. He deconstructed those cutesy images
and saw the sexuality and truth behind them."

  When Darger was a boy, his nickname was Crazy. These days he is embraced
with the term outsider. His tombstone offers another alternative: "Henry
Darger, 1892- 1973, Artist, Protector of Children."

Who's Who:

Highwire co-curator Greg Fuch's says "Brenda Bordofsky will chill you
the %^&*-out with her amazingly hypnotic poems about the body. She just
started her first year as a public high school teacher in Brooklyn." My
google search revealed that she ran the Big Sur Marathon in April 1999
and has had work in The germ.

Poet Steve Dalachinsky has collaborated with a host of musical talents,
among them Vernon Reid (Living Colour) and Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth).
He has performed at numerous events and conferences, including Lowell
Celebrates Kerouac, NYU Beat Generation Conference, and The New York
City Underground Music and Poetry Festival. Hozomeen Press is currently
publishing his selected poems.

Rob Fitterman is the author of Leases (Periphery Press 1986), Among The
Cynics (Singing Horse Press 1988) and Ameresque (1996). He is also the

Metropolis 1-15 is forthcoming with Sun & Moon Press. Edge Books
recently published Metropolis 16-20. He is the editor/publisher of
Object magazine and Object Editions/poetscoop. He is from St. Louis, and
has lived in NYC since 1981.

Joanna Fuhrman's first book Freud in Brooklyn was published by Hanging
Loose this year. Her poems have appeared in Fence, 6500, and other
journals.

Nada Gordon, born in Oakland, lived in Tokyo for 11 years, and now lives
in Brooklyn. Current major interest: "the carnivalisque." Forthcoming:
Foreign Bodie (Detour) and Are Not Our Lowing Heifers Sleeker than
Night-Swollen Mushrooms? (Spuyten Duyvil).

Bob Holman is a poet (7 books, 2 anthologies edited, 1 CD) and
performer. He was a founding co-director for the revitalized Nuyorican
Poets Cafe from 1989-1996, where he popularized the poetry slams and
created a touring company of poets. In 1996, he co-founded Mouth
Almighty/Mercury Records, the world's only poetry CD label with major
distribution. A pioneer in the collaboration of poetry and
television--his first poetry video, "sweat'n'sex'n'politics" was
introduced by Lou Reed at The Public Theater in 1985--since 1991, he has
worked with Josh Blum to produce the breakthrough PBS poetry video
programs, Words in Your Face and The United States of Poetry. In 1998,
he was appointed Visiting Professor in Writing at Bard College, where he
teaches "Exploding Text: Poetry in Performance."

Originally from Canada, Adeena Karasick is the author of four books of

Poet and writer Bob Rosenthal was Allen Ginsberg's secretary for 20
years and is currently writing his account of the experience.

Dan Shot is the publisher of Long Shot, a themed literary journal out of
northern New Jersey, where he lives with his family. His poetry appeared
in Aloud: Voices from the Nuyorican Poet’s Cafe, and his collected
poetry is scheduled for publication next year.

If you went to high school in Bayonne, New Jersey, from 1952 to 1986,
chances are you hung out at Herschel's Beehive Candy Store. And chances
are the proprietor, Herschel Silverman, was sponsoring your sports team
while he encouraged you to excel. But perhaps you might not have known
that "the candystore emperor of Bayonne" (as in a poem by Allen
Ginsberg) was also a jazz poet of considerable renown. He has published
hundreds of poems in literary journals including Long Shot, Alpha Beat
(Canada), Journal of New Jersey Poets 20th Anniversary Issue, and
Kerouac Connection, and was the editor of Beehive Magazine of
Contemporary Poetry (New Jersey). He has 20 collections of poetry.

I first saw Jessica Stein read poetry in Albany, NY when she was 13
years old. I saw her read there again last month, now 20something, and
recently graduated from NYU. She lives in Brooklyn.

Karen Weiser lives and writes in New York City. She is the editor of
Hophophop Press. She is the co-author of a collaborative chapbook
Beneath the Bright Discus (Potes & Poets). Recent poems have appeared in
Lungfull!, The germ, and The Hat.

Ian Wilder has four chapbooks and performs his poetry with the bands
Nylon & Steel and SpiritWalkers.

Like, that HW allegedly has a taste for 12 year old boys, a nasty nocturnal
leftover from his Andover days, and that he does some serious covert work on
satisfying those tastes?  it certainly helps to have a man in power who has
a certain weakness...it could make him very controllable, just as it could
make him very controlling.

Richard,

Actually, it was Mr Baker I was thinking off when I used the term thug, tho
Mr Cheney comes equally to mind. I haven't figured out what to make of Mrs
Rice -- she has that "deer caught in the headlights" look every time I see
her on the news, a feature she shares with George W.

Speaking of whom (W, that is), I do have some friends who are members of the
Bush clan & what they say about that whole side of the family is far worse
than anything anyone has posted here, or is likely to.

One more thing.
The continued attacks on Conservative persons and institutions by members of
this community, as if it were mere sport, divides and alienates, it rivens
society and poisons the common spring of language.  It is a bullying
behavior because it does not permit a comeback from the other quarter.  Your
wits drive full blast down one way streets and run over pop up targets again
and again.  The use of "thugs" to describe people like Mrs. Rice, a
professor at Stanford, is simply shameless.  Shame on you, Ron Silliman.
You really don't know the quality of person you insult.  Shame.

On NPR's Morning Edition last week, Nina Tottenberg said that if the
Supreme Court supports Congress, it is in effect the end of the National
Publio Radio (NPR), NEA & the Public Broadcasting System(PBS).

PBS, NPR and the arts are facing major cutbacks in funding. In spite of the
efforts of each station to reduce spending costs and stream line their
services, some government officials believe that the funding currently going
to these programs is too large a portion of funding for something which is
seen as not worthwhile.

The only way that our representatives can be aware of the base of support
for PBS and funding for these types of programs is by making our voices
heard. Please add your name to this list and forward it to friends who
believe in what this stands for.

This list will be forwarded to the President and the Vice President of the
United States. This petition is being passed around the Internet. Please add
your name to it so that funding can be maintained for NPR, PBS, & the NEA.

HOW TO SIGN & FORWARD: IT'S EASY: Please keep this petition rolling.

Do not reply to me. Please sign and forward to others to sign.  If you
prefer not to sign, please send to the E-mail address indicated below.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT DUPLICATES. This is being forwarded to several people at
once to add their names to the petition. It won't matter if many people
receive the same list as the names are being managed. This is for anyone
who thinks NPR/PBS is a worthwhile expenditure of $1.12/year of their taxes.

I happily and openly declare myself unashamed to call the sock-puppet
elect and his thugs thugs, Ms. Rice included.  What kind of message is it
to women and minorities that George W can be president but not the
smartest woman or minority candidate in all the land?  Affirmative action
for duller sons of dull Ivy League dads, no?

Hi Bill,

I am finishing up in Brit Lit and I have the best quote for you from

DEFENCE OF POETRY. PART FIRST. by Percy Bysshe Shelley. I hope this helps.

Best, Geoffrey



¶9
§59 A Poem is the very image of life expressed in its eternal truth. §60
There is this difference between a story and a poem, that a story is a
catalogue of detached facts, which have no other bond of connexion than
time, place, circumstance, cause and effect; the other is the creation of
actions according to the unchangeable forms of human nature, as existing in
the mind of the creator, which is itself the image of all other minds. §61
The one is partial, and applies only to a definite period of time, and a
certain combination of events which can never again recur; the other is
universal and contains within itself the germ of a relation to whatever
motives or actions have place in the possible varieties of {{Sig. 4r}} human
nature. §62 Time, which destroys the beauty and the use of the story of
particular facts, stript of the poetry which should invest them, augments
that of Poetry and forever developes new and wonderful applications of the
eternal truth which it contains. §63 Hence epitomes have been called the
moths of just history; they eat out the poetry of it. §64 A story of
particular facts is as a mirror which obscures and distorts that which
should be beautiful: Poetry is a mirror which makes beautiful that which is
distorted.

¶10
§65 The parts of a composition may be poetical, without the composition as a
whole being a poem. §66 A single sentence may be considered as a whole
though it may be found in the midst of a series of unassimilated portions; a
single word even may be a spark of inextinguishable thought. §67 And thus
all the great historians, Herodotus, Plutarch, Livy, were poets; and
although the plan of these writers, especially that of Livy, constrained
them from developing this faculty in its highest degree they make copious
and ample amends for their subjection, by filling all the interstices of
their subjects with living images.

The "Save the NEA/NPR/PBS" e-petition circulated to this discussion group by
Michael Broder is a HOAX.  Please do every god-fearing internet user a favor
and do not forward it.

Reference it here: http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/petition/nea.htm

Or read below....


***********

Save the NEA!
Claim:   The NEA, NPR, PBS, and Sesame Street are in danger of extinction
due to government cutbacks in funding for the arts.
Status:   False.

***********

Example:   [Collected on the Internet, 1995]

SAVE SESAME STREET!
This is a petition to save Sesame Street. ALL YOU DO IS ADD YOUR NAME TO
THE LIST AT THE BOTTOM, then forward it to everyone  you know. The only
time you send it to the included address is if you are the 50th, 100th,
etc. Send it on to everyone you know.

PBS, NPR (National Public Radio), and the arts are facing major cutbacks
in funding. In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce spending
costs and streamline their services, the government officials believe that
the funding currently going to these programs is too large a portion of
funding for something which is seen as "unworthwhile." Currently, taxes
from the general public for PBS equal $1.12 per person per year, and the
National Endowment for the Arts equals $.64 a year in total. A January
1995 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll indicated that 76% of Americans wish to
keep funding for PBS, third only to national defense and law enforcement
as the most valuable programs for federal funding.

Each year, the Senate and House Appropriations commitees each have 13
subcommitees with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies. Each
subcommitee passes its own appropriation bill. The goal each year is to
have each bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year, which is
October 1. In the instance of the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, the
bill determines the funding for the next three years.

When this issue comes up in 1996, the funding will be determined for
fiscal years 1996-1998.

The only way that our representatives can be aware of the base of support
or PBS and funding for these types of programs is by making our voices
heard.

Please add your name to this list if you believe in what we stand for.
This list will be forwarded to the President of the United States, the
Vice President of the United States, the House of Representatives and
Congress.

If you happen to be the 50th, 100th, 150th, etc. signer of this petition,
please forward to: <kubi7975@blue.univnorthco.edu>. This way we can keep
track of the lists and organize them. Forward this to everyone you know,
and help us to keep these programs alive.

Thank you.

***********

Origins:   In 1995 a student at the University of Northern Colorado was
writing a paper for a class about the downfall of culture in our society.
During the course of her research, she discovered the proposed
congressional spending cuts to PBS's budget. Being young and idealistic,
she decided to do something about it. She enlisted the help of another
student, and the two of them drafted the petition that was to haunt the
Internet for years to come.

The original contained no reference to Sesame Street -- that part was
added shortly after the petition began to circulate, likely by a
well-meaning supporter who thought suggesting that Sesame Street was in
danger would garner additional sympathy for the cause.

And it did.

Couched in terms of "Save Sesame Street!," this petition decrying proposed
government cuts to the 1996 public television budget began circulating on
the Internet in the spring of 1995. (The ways of the Internet being what
they are, it continues to circulate even though the "crisis" has long
passed. Scarelore rarely comes with expiration dates.) The response it
raised was breathtaking. The two college students who'd dreamed it up were
almost immediately swamped with 2,000 incoming e-mails a day. Attempting
to compile petition lists to forward to the government quickly became a
Herculean task.

Stopping what they'd set in motion proved every bit as impossible as
keeping track of the incoming mail. After the congressional budget was
announced (and arts funding wasn't slaughtered as badly as had been
anticipated), they sent out a follow-up e-mail telling people the danger
was over, to quit circulating the petition, and to tell others who were
still circulating it to stop. To no avail though -- that petition
continues to make the rounds even to this day.

Though it's true the 104th Congress did cut the 1996 public television
budget to $260 million, Sesame Street was never in danger of being axed.
The Sesame Street name was invoked solely to anger people enough to get
them involved in the protest over public television cuts, not because the
show itself was at risk. As such, the ranks of those fighting the cuts
were seeded by those duped into believing a personally-cherished icon of
childhood was going down.

In addition to Sesame Street's huge popularity (a factor that makes it
highly unlikely the show will ever be tampered with), merchandising from
the show and its characters fetches an astronomical sum each year. (One
estimate I've seen places annual revenues at $800 million.) If ever there
were a public television program in no danger from having its funding cut,
it's Sesame Street.

All that aside, the petition attracted a enormous amount of attention as
concerned citizens everywhere rallied to defend the one show everyone
agreed should never be taken off the air. Sesame Street is instructive and
charming, but it's something more as well: a revered part of our culture.
We grew up with it. Our kids grew up with it. And Big Bird and Oscar are
part of all that's right in our world.

PBS was neither the force behind this misleading e-mail petition, nor did
they support it. The following is taken from the standard e-mail response
sent out by PBS Viewer Services regarding this petition rumor:


In the last several months, there has been a campaign on the Internet that
incorrectly alleges that SESAME STREET is in jeopardy of being taken off
the air. The "Save Sesame Street" campaign is unfounded and we at PBS and
Children's Television Workshop (CTW), the producers of SESAME STREET,
would like to tell you that Sesame Street is alive and well!
In fact, SESAME STREET launched its 28th Season on November 18, 1996 with
special guest ER's Noah Wyle. In addition to launching a new season,
SESAME STREET is busy preparing for their 30th anniversary celebration
which is just around the corner (fall 1998).

We can assure you that there is no PBS sanctioned petition. Please
disregard any you come across.



Like all good bad pieces of misinformative netsam, this one keeps going
and going. In early 1997 all references to Sesame Street were stripped out
of this message, and it began causing consternation all over again as it
made another round of the Internet. Then yet another version sprang up in
early 1999:


This message is long but important.
On Thursday January 6th's NPR Morning Edition, Nina Totenberg reported
that if the Supreme Court supports Congress to cut the budget of the
National Endowment of the Arts, it is in effect the end of NEA. This
situation creates great concerns about Congressional funding for creative
arts in America, since NEA provides major support for NPR (National Public
Radio), PBS (Public Broadcasting System), and numerous other creative and
performing arts. If NEA is lost or weakened, our lives will be similarly
diminished. In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce spending
costs and streamline their services, some government officials believe
that the funding currently going to these programs is too large a portion
of funding for something which is seen as not worthwhile. Currently, taxes
from the general public for PBS equal $1.12 per person per year, and the
National Endowment for the Arts equals $.64 a year. A January 1995 CNN/USA
Today/Gallup poll indicated that 76% of Americans wish to keep funding for
PBS, third only to national defense and law enforcement as the most
valuable programs for federal funding. Each year the Senate and House
Appropriations committees each have 13 subcommittees with jurisdiction
over many programs and agencies. Each subcommittee passes its own
appropriation bill. The goal each year is to have each bill signed by the
beginning of the fiscal year, which is October 1. The only way that our
representatives can be aware of the base of support for PBS and funding
for these types of programs is by our making our voices heard.

Please add your name to this list and forward it to friends who believe in
favor of what this stands for.

The full list will be forwarded to the President of the United States, the
Vice President, and the Speaker of the House, whose office has in the past
been the instigator of the action to cut funding to these worthwhile
programs. This petition is being passed around the Internet. Please add
your name to it so funding can be maintained for the NEA, NPR, and PBS.

THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO MAKE INTERNET TECHNOLOGY WORK AS A VOICE IN OUR
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. IT'S EASIER THAN EVER TO MAKE OUR VOICES HEARD. Please
keep the petition rolling. Do not reply to me. Add your name and locale to
the list and forward it to others to sign. If you prefer not to sign,
please send the list to the email address given below. This is being
forwarded to numerous people at once. It won't matter if many people
receive the same list as the names are being managed. This is for anyone
who thinks NPR and PBS deserve $1.12/year of their taxes. If you sign,
please forward the list to others. If not, please don't kill it. **** If
you happen to be the 150th, 200th, 250th, tc., signer of this petition,

outgoing message, rather than simply forwarding it.) In your new outgoing
message add your name to the bottom of the list, then send it on. Or, if
the option is available, do a SEND AGAIN.



Why anyone would re-invent the petition in 1997 and again in 1999 to fight
something that was a done deal by mid-1996 is beyond me. "IT'S EASIER THAN
EVER TO MAKE OUR VOICES HEARD" indeed -- unfortunately, this holds true
when even we're shouting about an issue that had a stake driven through
its heart several years ago.

ensuing emotions: "The rain falls into a tired sea. How many children does =

the sandman need? / All I wanted to do was race through this life. Soot fro=

Hey, people!

This is happening in San Francisco, FYI.  Jaime Cortez is a friend of mine,
as is the artist who is being threatened at present via e-mail.

I know many of you are no longer living or have never lived here, but the
e-network reaches far and wide, so I thought y'all should know about this,
and keep each other on the alert, as well as come forward with info on
similar attacks on art and queer artists in other cities.

We must be vigilant against these cowardly acts.

In love & solidarity,

December 13, 2000
Contact: Jaime Cortez 415-826-8009, (over the holidays please email
galeriadlraza@aol.com)

URGENTE: GALERIA DE LA RAZA IS THE TARGET OF ANONYMOUS ATTACKS.

Since the Galer=EDa de la Raza began its new era with more experimental
programming that pushed its established cultural and aesthetic boundaries,
attendance and media attention have increased considerably. Galer=EDa is once
again an important player in the cultural life of the city. However, severa=
l
apparently unrelated attacks have targeted Galer=EDa's staff and programming
over the last months.

-On the weekend of December 1st, Heaven, the digital mural at Galer=EDa=92s
public mural space by L.A. artist Alma Lopez was defaced. The mural contain=
s
poetic and spiritual images of love between two Latina women. Alma describe=
s
her work as follows: "Spirituality and sexuality both exist within me=85 to
separate them is impossible=85 The work I do comes from my heart and is not
meant to disrespect or offend." The defacement of the mural includes a
biblical reference to the book of Galatians and a comment referring to
"colored imitators of white man's enfatuations with one=92s own genitals."

-On the same day that Heaven was defaced, an artist affiliated with Galer=EDa
received threatening, homophobic emails from an alleged religious group.
Currently, the Human Rights Commission and the Hate Violence Unit of the
SFPD=20
are investigating these emails.

-That same week, the store window of Studio 24 was shot through with what
appeared to be a BB gun.

-Ese: One Last Mexican Discovered in the Mission, the previous mural that
addressed anti-displacement issues, was also defaced with anti-gay slogans.

This string of incidents is reminiscent of the vandalism and death threats
to=20
Galer=EDa's staff that occurred at Galer=EDa in 1997 during the showing of Alex
Donis' "My Cathedral," an exhibit which addressed queer politics, history
and=20
desire.

These actions can only exacerbate the racism, sexism and homophobia that
justify hate violence. It is unfortunate that certain individuals feel it i=
s
their right to deface public art works and send anonymous hate mail or emai=
l
threats without making any attempts at engaging in progressive dialogue.
Galer=EDa is dedicated to providing a space for art work that challenges our
community in productive and beneficial ways. Galer=EDa's programming reflects
the belief that democratic values thrive when diversity is respected and
embraced. We understand that struggles fought by people of color, queer
people, the working class and immigrants are not independent of each other.
When hate violence is directed at our cultural institutions, at our diverse
communities and at artists=92 freedom of expression, the entire community
suffers a loss. Panic politics and cultural terrorism prevent us from facin=
g
the true problems we have in our communities.

If you have any information about these events, please contact us as soon a=
s
possible.

From students in a UCLA/UCLA Extension poetry workshop I taught:

poetry is about fiction

not all poetry has a truth or meaning

poetry queries words and the world in a way fiction doesn't

there is care in the choices in poetry
there's an investment in poetry

poetry has a different goal, a different relationship to story, plot; is
about meaning rather than telling meaning

creating a world in fiction is more straightforward, formulaic, with
characters and dialogue

poetry is putting words together that directly expresses the art

in general poetry has greater affect and effect

poetry has visual qualities, uses the page as canvas, uses the page, is
arranged, in a way fiction is not

the process of writing poetry is totally different and so poetry is
totally different

poetry is the thought that doesn't have any words

poetry's process is more efficient,

and
from the student who became a novelist during the class:

Hello Laird---

Thanks for this---

I, too (as someone who has been called a poet) will also "pit" (your) list of
"non-poets" or "non-poems" against much of what is called poetry.....

I guess what I have held by and large as an assumption
for a decade or more
is the idea that such books as those you mention
are actually more POETIC than most of what is called poetry....

Is this an attempt by me to co-opt "prose?"
Or do I not know my proper genre niche?

chris

##############################################################

The Real Thing: Democracy as a Contact Sport
By Russell Mokhiber and Robert Weissman

A couple weeks ago, we received an invitation to attend an event at the
Library of Congress.

Coca-Cola was about to make an "historic contribution" to the Library of
Congress, and the Library, and Coca-Cola, were inviting reporters to cover
the event. We accepted the invitation.

We learned from the morning papers that the "historic contribution" was a
complete set of 20,000 television commercials pushing Coca-Cola into the
American digestive system.

Remember the one where the kid hands Pittsburgh Steeler Mean Joe Greene
his bottle of Coke, and in return, Mean Joe tosses the kid his football
jersey? Or what about on a hilltop in Italy where the folks start sing
"I'd like to buy the world a Coke and keep it company"?

The event was at the Great Hall of the Thomas Jefferson Building -- named
after the Thomas Jefferson who, in 1816, wrote: "I hope we shall crush in
its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to
challenge our government to a trial of strength, and bid defiance to the
laws our country."

Anyway, we pull up at the appointed hour (7:15 p.m. on November 29, 2000)
at the Thomas Jefferson building, and there's a traffic jam created by
stretch limousines blocking the entrance.

In addition to lowly reporters, the 400 or so guests included ambassadors,
members of Congress, corporate chieftains and other dignitaries. Good
thing we dressed up.

The Main Hall is this absolutely stunning room, with marble staircases. A
string quartet is playing. Waiters are serving Coke in classic bottles.
The food is fabulous -- lamb chops, trout, Peking duck. We rub shoulders
with the Ambassador from Burma.

The "aristocracy of our monied corporations," as Jefferson put it, had
taken over the place, and Coca-Cola wanted to make sure that everybody
knew it.

After all, Coke could have just donated the ads to the Library and left it
at that. But this wasn't about Coke's largesse. It was about public
relations -- whether the public would view the company as a racist company
(Coke had just agreed to pay $192.5 million to settle allegations that it
routinely discriminated against black employees in pay, promotions and
performance evaluations) or a junk food pusher (consuming large quantities
of sugared Coca-Cola has led to ours being one of the most overweight
generations in history) -- or instead, a generous contributor to the
Library of Congress.

James Billington, the Librarian of Congress, was called on to deliver good
things to Coke, and he did. He turned over the keys of the Main Hall to
Coke, and Coke decked the place out with its logo, stitched in red beside
the logo of the Library of Congress. Television sets were placed
throughout the hall, the better for the Ambassadors and members of the
Democratic Leadership Council to check out the commercials.

Billington was selling the soul of the library to one of the world's most
powerful corporations. In addition to the ads, Coke was establishing a
fellowship at the Library for the study of "culture and communication" --
one fellow will receive $20,000 a year for the next five years.

Gary Ruskin, director of Commercial Alert, was outside the event,
protesting. "It is not the proper role of the taxpayer-financed Library of
Congress to help promote junk food like Coca-Cola to a nation that is
suffering skyrocketing levels of obesity," Ruskin said. "It is crass
commercialism for James Billington to degrade Jefferson's library and
founding ideals into a huckster's backdrop."

But without shame, Billington introduced Doug Daft, the president of
Coca-Cola, who said that "Coca-Cola has become an integral part of
people's lives by helping to tell these stories." Nothing about profits.
Nothing about overweight kids. Nothing about racism.

After Daft spoke, the room went dark, and the ads ran on the television
screens. Nostalgia swept the room. When the ads were finished, the lights
went back on and the crowd cheered.

About 80 high school students, dressed in Coca-Cola red sweaters, filled
the marble staircases and sang -- "I want to buy the world a Coke." Again,
the crowd cheered.  Doug Daft, standing downstairs, came back to the
microphone to continue his statement. We were upstairs at this point, and
we looked down at him and asked, in a loud voice -- "Why are you using a
public library to promote a junk food product?"

The room went quiet. Library of Congress police charged up the marble
staircase. Doug Daft put his hand to his ear and shouted back to us: "What
did you say?"

In a louder voice, we shouted back: "Why are you using a public
institution to promote a junk food product?"

The next thing we know, we are on the ground. The Library of Congress
police had tackled us. Again, the crowd cheered -- not for our question,
but for the tackle.

We were dragged downstairs, past the Ambassador from Burma, and hauled
outside, where police officers from the District of Columbia were waiting
for us.

Out of the Thomas Jefferson building came running a man from Coke. "This
is a private event," the man from Coke told the police. "I'm from
Coca-Cola."

At first, the police wanted nothing to do with the man from Coke. But the
man from Coke insisted. They huddled.

Apparently, the man from Coke didn't want us arrested for asking an
obvious question. Apparently, the man from Coke didn't want a public
trial. The man from Coke was standing up for our First Amendment rights to
ask his boss a question.

The police said we were to leave the grounds. And we weren't to come back.
Ever.

i was told that the marquez farewell was a hoax; see below...

Recently, the text of a poem called "La marioneta" has been passed =
around
the Internet, as well as run in several Latin American newspapers. (You =
can
read it on the PSA site
<http://www.psa-rising.com/voices/farewell/index.htm>; where it is =
still
incorrrectly attributed to Gabo.) Attributed to Garc=EDa M=E1rquez and =
believed
to be a "farewell letter" to his friends, it was uncovered to really be =
the
work of a ventriloquist named Johnny Welch. Alas, while Gabo is indeed
suffering from lymphatic cancer, this "farewell letter" is merely a =
hoax,
similar to a recent letter widely believed to have been penned by Kurt
Vonnegut, Jr.
The LA Times has a Reuters piece detailing the hoax
<http://sports.latimes.com/news/20000601/null/990601.5281.html> here.

Jagjaguwar (an indie label) is doing its best to bring Creeley to more
people, and to create a lasting document.

I've discussed with the label the idea of expanding this into a regular
series, being an indie label he/they are concerned about being able to
support the series. I've shared some ideas with him about putting
together a schedule and making it a subscription series, trying to
secure grants, etc. Poets don't exactly tour and sell a CD or two at
every stop.

The guy who runs the label is fiercely dedicated to bringing good stuff
to the people, but isn't in the position to be the sole financial
supporter of such an endeavor. So please forward on suggestions on how
to make it work if you have any (to me, backchannel, or through the site
to him). I would really like to see this project take off and am sure we
all have ideas for people that definitely need to be recorded and shared
in this format. Why aren't there more recorded documents of the amazing
readings we've seen? Example: Miles Champion, lives too far away to hear
regularly, but damn that guy can read. Or Daniel Higgs, imagine him
without the backing band (the amazing Lungfish, but still). You get the
picture.

And make sure to look out for or pre-order the record in the new year.
It will NOT be at your local Tower Records, I'm pretty sure of that.

It's hard to believe that this piece of sentimental trash could be written by Marquez. Obviously, it's a hoax. See Reuters statement below.

'Farewell poem' fools readers
Reuters
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -- A poem published in several Latin American newspapers this week and said to be a farewell ode by Colombia's ailing Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez turned out on Wednesday to be the work of a little-known ventriloquist.
The poem titled "La Marioneta" -- "The Puppet" -- appeared under Garcia Marquez's name on Monday in the Peruvian daily La Republica. Mexico City dailies reproduced it on Tuesday and it was read on local radio stations.
"Gabriel Garcia Marquez sings a song to life," read a headline in Mexico City's La Cronica, which on Tuesday published the poem superimposed on a photo of the novelist on its front page.
"My God, if I had a bit of life I would not let one instant go by without telling the people I love that I love them," read the sentimental poem that also circulated on the Internet.
But like the speech supposed to have been given by U.S.
novelist Kurt Vonnegut in 1997 urging graduates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to use sun screen, the author of "La Marioneta" turn out not nearly as famous as advertised.
"I'm feeling the disappointment of someone who has written something and is not getting credit," ventriloquist Johnny Welch told Mexico's InfoRed radio on Wednesday.
Welch, who has worked for 15 years as a ventriloquist in Mexico and other parts of Latin America, said he wrote the poem for his puppet sidekick "Mofles."
"I'm not a writer," he confessed.
In 1997 a humor column by Chicago Tribune columnist Mary Schmich was widely redistributed on the Internet, but was incorrectly billed as an MIT commencement address by Vonnegut.
Garcia Marquez won the Nobel prize for literature in 1982. His seminal work, "100 Years of Solitude," has been translated into 36 languages and sold millions of copies worldwide.
In an October 1999 interview with New Yorker magazine, the 73-year-old author acknowledged having been treated for lymphatic cancer in the summer of 1999 in Los Angeles. Rumors of his failing health have surfaced several times in Latin America in recent months.
Garcia Marquez did not comment publicly on the apocryphal poem, but several close associates denied he had anything to do with it. "It's a shame there are such good forgeries of paintings but such lousy forgeries of literature," Argentine author Tomas Eloy Martinez told Mexico City's Reforma newspaper.

 A Zimbabwe politician was quoted as saying that children should study
 the US election event closely because it shows that election fraud is
 not only a third world phenomena. To illustrate the point, he made
 the following comments;

 "Imagine that we read of an election occurring anywhere in the third
 world in which the self-declared winner was the son of the former
 prime minister and that former prime minister was himself the former
 head of that nation's secret police (the CIA).

 Imagine that the self-declared winner lost the popular vote but won
 based on some old colonial holdover from the nation's pre-democracy
 past (the electoral college).

 Imagine that the self-declared winner's `victory' turned on disputed
 votes cast in a province governed by his brother!

 Imagine that the poorly drafted ballots of one district, a district
 heavily favoring the self-declared winner's opponent, led thousands
 of voters to vote for the wrong candidate.

 Imagine that members of that nation's most despised caste, fearing
 for their lives/livelihoods, turned out in record numbers to vote in
 near-universal opposition to the self-declared winner's candidacy.

 Imagine that hundreds of members of that most-despised caste were
 intercepted on their way to the polls by state police operating under
 the authority of the self-declared winner's brother.

 Imagine that six million people voted in the disputed province and
 that the self-declared winner's `lead' was only 327 votes. Fewer,
 certainly, than the vote counting machines' margin of error.

 Imagine that the self-declared winner and his political party opposed
 a more careful by-hand inspection and re-counting of the ballots in
 the disputed province or in its most hotly disputed district.

 Imagine that the self-declared winner, himself a governor of a major
 province, had the worst human rights record of any province in his
 nation and actually led the nation in executions.

 Imagine that a major campaign promise of the self-declared winner was
 to appoint like-minded human rights violators to lifetime positions
 on the high court of that nation.

 None of us would deem such an election to be representative of
 anything other than the self-declared winner's will-to-power. All of
 us, I imagine, would wearily turn the page thinking that it was
 another sad tale of pitiful pre- or anti-democracy peoples in some
 strange, faraway elsewhere."

Esteemed Friend and fellow worker

        Actually re the Mumia case--so much has gone on surrounding it,
it may well now be impossible to know the truth of what happened.

        An example of this my oldest son wrote me about--he's going to
UMASS-Amherst.  As a counter Free Mumia Day--a number of groups decided to
hold a Fry Mumia Day.

        My son showed up with a can of gasoline and fistfulof lighters.
He was warmly welcomed by the collected Fryers--until they realized he
meant to set fire to their place of gathering!

        "The apple doesn't fall too far from the tree . . . "

        The case I am most concerned with and active with myself is that
of
Leonard Peltier.

        This case is so explosive that a demonstration will be taking
place this Friday the 15 December 2000 by the FBI itself--against
Mr. Peltier's plea for clemency.

        However, what dos concern me really here is the so called justice
system--a concern I think many immigrants to these shores share.



        That is, poor representation, the manipulation of trials and
prisoners for other ends than their human rights--which are so hugely so
often orverlooked with such blitheness in the justice injustice
system--that cases do wind up spinning out of the original sphere and into
others.

        My main concern is with the right to a free and fair trial and
the
fair treatment of offenders. This does not mean either a hard core "law
and
order" response resulting in some truly hideous sentencings and also
eludings of sentencings depending on one's social postion--nor a "soft on
crime" approach which allows for the evasion of taking responsability for
one's acts.

        The prison system at present is so completely overburdened with
prisoners and offenders out on proabtion and parole that it has lost
all sense of perspective and indeed of efficiency, reason, and justice
itself.

        Human rights abuses abound--and many a wealthy and
influential person walks away scot free.

        I think the concerns I have actually go across the board of all
political perspectives--

        mainly, the right to competent representation, the right to have
evidence and witnesses properly handled, the right to a fair and free
trial, and the right to access of all records.


        Having had experience with the justice system(s) in this and a
number
of other countries, I realize this may seem "a hopeless case" to be
affirming so to
speak--yet as well--I think that these things, rather than being
"radlib"--are actually supposed to be guaranteed by the Constitution and
laws of the United States.

        When they are not, it is the responsability and the RIGHT of the
citizen to speak/write out and demonstrate as well.

        When rights guaranteed by the Constitution are being vialoted or
questioned, and need reexamining in many cases--it is not the time to
"rest one's case".

Calligraphic


Calligraphy fascinates because it conjures the impossible coupling of the
machine / incision / inscription - as if the world were divine (Foucauld-
ian divinatio) with style leaving space for thought otherwise. I am refer-
encing Chinese or Japanese calligraphy - not pictogrammatic, but gesture
which infiltrates the line and its endings in various pathways. It is the
space or gap which reveals both the inertness of the world and the place-
ment of writing as breathing, not harboring ontology or name the things of
creation, but slowing their undoing. You might see affect in the layering
of symbols, always, as if it impossible to speak without the body in mind,
as if all creations are inequal, languorous and dependent upon their emo-
tional originations. This is not the concrete poetry of the calligraphic;
it is not the renaissance emblem or shaped poetics or signature. Instead,
one might look to the writing as the slow movement of the earths absolving
all denumerations, definitions, taxonomies - or the earths' quickness in
asserting themselves through the releasing of signs into the earth, stone,
metal, air, water, fire ... the ideogrammar of non-being, ideogrammar of
this world's last creation ...

And this my own twisted stroke through all of it - the running writing,
grass writing, clerical, seal, etc. Or perhaps not the seal with, so oft-
en, its unnerving rectilinearity, already speaking confinement of the rim,
the contract. Certainly through the varying width of strokes otherwise.

In Seals (cdrom video), Azure and I demarcate each other's bodies, sealing
them with hanko stone and ink; our bodies tangle; the kanji are worn out,
worn through; exhausted, we're framed by the sealing processes; the ins-
criptions of the world disappearing into the flesh; in a certain silence
or background sound; you can watch in any order; there is also the clear
evidence of desire, erection going nowhere, seals just above penis and
vagina, the k/not of the writings - and presence or absence of the vacated
space of non-being, as if this were the next-to-last ...

Clearing a space, unnaming, all within the absenting of the frame as well,
computer screen, software application screen, uncanny inertness of windows
appearing and disappearing, inscription denying itself, an accumulation of
protocols and languages tending towards their metaphoric dissolution ...

Fu Shan: "With painstaking care, he used a centered brush tip to make
strong, rounded strokes in imitation of the even, unmodulated lines in an-
cient bronze inscriptions. He also undermined the readability of the sutra
by littering it with strange characters. A religious text is seemingly
transformed into a magical charm by an unreadably archaic script further
confused by invented characters." (The Aesthetics of the Unusual and the
Strange in Seventeenth-Century Calligraphy, by Dora C. Y. Ching, in Harr-
ist and Fong, The Embodied Image: Chinese Calligraphy from the John B.
Elliott Collection.)

All machines of all languages and all words and all symbols and all subs-
trates and all texts and all utterances and all pauses and all sounds and
all worlds and all things and all non-things and all breaths and all mach-
ines ...

"And to dramative matters, Butor is an old friend of Klossowksi, and Klo-
ssowski says: 'my syntax is Roberte's skin.' _My syntax,_ and not the sup-
port for my writing or its eventual printing. And _Roberte's skin_ is the
skin enclosing the volume of a discrete body carrying a proper name. Now
isn't what Klossowski expresses here perversion? The hardness, the tension
of grammar and glossary operate like the production of a screen stretched
to the breaking point. This screen closes upon itself into a voluminous
body - the body of Roberte - amd this body can be connected to a subject
who will inhabit its interior. Thus any fixed variation of grammar, of
glossary will produce a sign, a shiver, a passing of intensity upon the
body proper of the victim." (False Flights in Literature, Jean-Francois
Lyotard, in Toward the Post-Modern, ed. Harvey and Roberts.)

One might call forth the brush against the computer screen, stretched to
the breaking point across a skin wearing its display, immobilized, punc-
tured, hung. All machines and all languages and all protocols and all and
so forth and all ... ...

"Can there be speech, poetry, and thought beyond the letter, beyond the
death of the voice and the death of language?" (Pascoli and the Thought of
the Voice, Giorgio Agamben, The End of the Poem, Studies in Poetics.)

The imaginary of the sliding body within an inconceivability of the tech-
nological (all technology is inconceivable), since, as for the calligraph-
ic, it fastens itself (calligraphic ideogrammar)

"It is therefore not truly a matter of phono-symbolism, but rather a mat-
ter of a sphere so to speak beyond or before sound, a sphere that does not
_symbolize_ anything as much as it simply _indicates_ an intention to sig-
nify, that is, the voice in its originary purity." (ibid.)

The calligraphic fastens itself only in order to release; nothing gnaws
the end of the stroke or its delimitation, enumeration, against the radi-
cals which presuppose ruined and incoherent taxonomies. The stroke is the
weakest emission, however lending itself to techne, the rigorous ordering
of the remains of the world. In Seals, after the stroke of the hanko
against the rigorous skin, a drop of lubricant* appears at the tip of the
penis, as if the body might then, after all is said and written, continue
its slide elsewhere.

I read fiction too, but there's more to say than that.

Geraldine wrote about "novels whose artificiality is pure delight" -- I do
sense that, for instance, in _Love in the Time of Cholera_ -- right now I'm
reading _Bleak House_ and sense it there too.  Dickens really spins the
story up, with repetition, exaggeration, and pure comedy.

David wrote:

But what if the difference is between eyes and hair?  If someone said "you
must give one up" then I would certainly choose hair.  Does one ask whether
one's hands or heart is more important?  I would definitely give up my hands
to keep my heart. etc.   Hell, I would give up my arms & legs to keep my
heart.

So to all who responded "there's no point in asking which is better", maybe
I can rephrase my thesis: one of them is more vital, and it is the one
that's being forgotten about.  It's the ancient republic of poetry that has
been overthrown in favor of the expedient democracy of fiction.  That's my
thesis.

So I say, goodbye little words and songs; goodbye rhythm, goodbye lines.
Hello sentences, meandering telephone conversations.

Goodbye trees and pens; hello laser printers, cardboard houses.

Sayonara good old Book Den. Hello fucking Barnes and Noble.

America is becoming bigger, louder, and less meaningful, as I fear her
inhabitants are.

Richard says, "I dont think there is neccessarily a 'better' form. Just as
people listen to music or use music for different occassions or reasons."  I
guess that's true.  I enjoy novels too, sometimes.   I enjoy hamburgers,
too, and there's definitely an occasion for Budweiser, but I guess I'm
saying, why's everybody drinking Bud when there's beaujolais to be had?  You
don't need as much of it, and it's a pleasanter drunk.

Anyway, here's to Michael Amberwind.

D.H. Lawrence on realism, Flaubert, Joyce, Proust...


***

Realism is just one of the arbitrary views man takes of man. It sees us all
as little ant-like creatures toiling against the odds of circumstance. . . .
I think the inherent flaw in Madame Bovary is that individuals like Emma and
Charles Bovary are too insignificant to carry the full weight of Gustave
Flaubert's profound sense of tragedy . . . Emma and Charles Bovary are two
ordinary persons, chosen because they are ordinary. But Flaubert is by no
means an ordinary person. Yet he insists on pouring his own deep and bitter
tragic consciousness into the little skins of the country doctor and his
dissatisfied wife. . . .

the human soul has supreme joy in true, vivid consciousness. And Flaubert's
soul has this joy. But Emma Bovary's soul does not, poor thing, because she
was deliberately chosen because her soul was ordinary. . . .

[Yet] Even Emma Bovary has a certain extraordinary female energy of
restlessness and unsatisfied desire. So that both Flaubert and Verga allow
their heroes something of the hero, after all. The one thing they deny them
is the consciousness of heroic effort.

Let us just for the moment feel the pulses of Ulysses and of Miss Dorothy
Richardson and M. Marcel Proust, on the earnest side of Briareus; on the
other, the throb of The Shiek and Mr. Zane Gray, and, if you will, Mr.
Robert Chambers and the rest. Is Ulysses in his cradle? Oh, dear! What a
grey face! And Pointed Roofs, are they a gay little toy for nice little
girls? Alas! You can hear the death-rattle in their throats. They can hear
it in themselves. They are listening to it with acute interest, trying to
discover whether the intervals are minor thirds or major fourths. . . .

It is self-consciousness picked into such fine bits that the bits are most
of them invisible, and you have to go by smell.

"Did I feel a twinge in my little toe, or didn't I?" asks every character of
Mr. Joyce or of Miss Richardson or M. Proust. . . . Through thousands and
thousands of pages Mr. Joyce and Miss Richardson tear themselves to pieces,
strip their smallest emotions to the finest threads, till you feel you are
sewed inside a wool mattress that is being slowly shaken up, and you are
turning to wool along with the rest of the woolliness.

It's awful. And it's childish. It really is childish, after a certain age,
to be absorbedly self-conscious.

Tisa:

Thanks for sending this.  I'd forwarded it on to someone who let me know
that it's a hoax! :-(  I gather that Garcia Marquez has addressed it
directly.  He does have lymphatic cancer, but he has been squirreled away
writing his memoirs and completing several books of short stories.  He did
recently appear at the inauguration of Vicente Fox Quesada, Mexico's new
president.

Patrick/Ron:

I must object that the popular slurs in
your message (>>HW allegedly has a
taste for 12 year old boys, a nasty
nocturnal leftover from his Andover
days,<< etc., below) is a recurrence of
a particular type of
sex-prejudice/vilification that has
passed uncontested in this Poetics List
before.  Recently, it was the artist
Henry Darger whom people here were
similarly taking stabs at this way (re:
pedophilia/pederasty).

Anyone objecting (like me) is of course
placed in the untenable, NAMBLA-ish
position of trying to defend a universal
pariah figure,--- but especially in a
public literary/intellectual forum such as
this where, Patrick, the intention of your
would-be "mudslinging" is to ~prove~
your liberalism, unexamined use of
maligned stereotypes like this easy
joke's seems very ill-considered, if not
yahoo. The successful propagation of
the "monster" image you are
reenforcing has been a key tactic of the
"repressive" regimes' propaganda that
you're trying to puncture, may I remind
us.

The pederasts ("chicken hawk") or
pedophiles whom you're sideswiping
are ~real~ people, who by and large
"suffer from" a condition,--- one that
has shown to be quite unresponsive to
all therapies, with almost 100%
recidivism.  Your scarecrow "chicken
hawk" here has been the hot-bed, as it
were, of nation-wide "rightist" legal
extremism: the East Coast Megan Law,
California legislation toward chemical
castration of sex offenders, web "Most
Wanted" galleries where the identity
and ~addresses~ of the convicted are
to be posted, etc., etc.  I'm surprised
that your frame of reference could be
so narrow as not to know of, personally
by way of social contacts, the terror
that pederasts/pedophiles live under,
constant anxiety over arrest, divided
will, etc.

You are dragging the bar of discussion
extremely low. This, Henry Darger, ---
go on --- Lewis Carroll?  Nabokov?

--- Chris (Charles B?), I thought the
exclusion of such "hate mail" was one
of the agreed-upon justifications for a
List-monitor.

To say nothing of Andover...!

Richard,

Actually, it was Mr Baker I was thinking
off when I used the term thug, tho
Mr Cheney comes equally to mind. I
haven't figured out what to make of Mrs
Rice -- she has that "deer caught in the
headlights" look every time I see
her on the news, a feature she shares
with George W.

Speaking of whom (W, that is), I do
have some friends who are members of
the
Bush clan & what they say about that
whole side of the family is far worse
than anything anyone has posted here,
or is likely to.

One more thing.
The continued attacks on Conservative
persons and institutions by members of
this community, as if it were mere
sport, divides and alienates, it rivens
society and poisons the common spring
of language.  It is a bullying
behavior because it does not permit a
comeback from the other quarter.  Your
wits drive full blast down one way
streets and run over pop up targets
again
and again.  The use of "thugs" to
describe people like Mrs. Rice, a
professor at Stanford, is simply
shameless.  Shame on you, Ron
Silliman.
You really don't know the quality of

Even I had wondered at the breath-taking hypocrisy of the Supreme Court
majority's invocation of equal protection and the 14th amendment -- then I
read the decision --

If you read all the way through you'll note that the majority themselves
realized that they dared not leave open the hole they had just torn -- so,
they write that this decision is only applicable to state-wide recounts
"under the present circumstances" -- rather like those tax bills passed by
the House from time to time that when closely read turn out to apply to
only one tax-payer -- Translation, unless your name is "Bush," don't even
think about appealing any other electoral inequities to this court on the
basis of the equal protection clause --

I'm going to go read a healthy dose of Melville for as antidote  (by the
way, in his case the fiction really is better than the poetry! though you
really should read Hilton Obenzinger's discussion of CLAREL)

I too find these issues enormously consuming.  I've been looking at them
terms of quantum mechanics and also in terms of narcissism.  Through both
lenses this recent political upset seems to me to be the best possible thin=
g
that could have happened to the country.  On Charlie Rose the other night I
saw a bunch of very respectables all lamenting that America may loose faith
in the impartiality of a judge.  To me this "loss" seems like the public
finally catching up to what physicists where looking at 50 years ago, that
the observer can not observe without altering what he sees.  So it looks
like we're moving on and developing more sophisticated patterns of public
thought. this is just a moment of "growing pain"  The tricky part is how to
embrace the quantum while avoiding the dangers of nominalism and relativism=
.


The narcissism argument works the same way, that is that America has been i=
n
a terrible narcissism, unable to see outside of itself and pigish-ly strict
in its need to be world powerful.  I think that this upset now is reflectiv=
e
of the begin of a breaking down of that narcissism where America is being
forced to see that it is not what it thought it was.


What all this means for American poetry could be an opening from a lot of
the Natzi narrative poets and other styles which are dependent on a
certainty of knowing.  What it means for a American writing in general may
be an opening toward poetry.

I think it=B9s fabulous to say that Newton invented gravity.  Really the
thinking that is epitomized by Newton and industrialization has been much
more compatible with that preceded it.  I see him as a big disruptive lump.
Of course I hope that I=B9m completely wrong :.)

Calligraphic Legacy Applications and the Scrawl


unreadable calligraphic, the scrawl - one might think of the edgy brunt of
the symbol, borders unprotected, conjectural spaces. what occurs to read-
ing, paralleling outmoded tech - decades from now, cdroms will be as thick
- unable to be decoded. from the analog to the digital, decoding becomes
increasingly difficult. think of wire recording - this is readable at any
speed - the double difficulty lies only in direction and speed. with mul-
ti-tracking, an additional element - that of settlement of desired sounds
- how many might play control-track background in the distant future? but
all of this is relatively simple; helical-scan video - even scan-line vid-
eo already plays calligraphic havoc. with digital, the problem is close to
insurmountable - there are codes upon codes based on specific programs and
protocols; there is the requirement of highly-sophisticated machinery -
think of a 19th-century music-box cylinder without any other instructions
- without knowing the scale employed or even the means of sound production
- you're getting the idea. but the obtuse calligraphic itself is dependent
upon the knowledge that, not only is the substrate readable, but the fault
- if such it be - lies in the complex negotiation between writer and read-
er - always already mediated. here again the unnerving, uncanny, unaccoun-
table, is raised - as if the text has been cast loose from its overly fam-
iliar mooring. think of xu bing or fu shan in this connection ...

errors, and we are all fired up by the initial results."  [SK]

Operating systems cannot give a warning when they suffer such a "prydxl lock".
The device must be isolated from its power source and then
reconnected. It is recognised that most if not all computational device freezes

are caused by the locking of a prydxl. It is not yet clear whether more
than one "prydxl" lock can happen simultaneously. [AM]

25. (n)  that which comes before prediction (Orig:Babel Fish Corp) [SR]

like in the home environment, where
pocket change (pennies et al) has been known to collect at the speed of light;
(orig.) modelled on the pinball machine, it
saves customers and consumers alike the arduous tasks of counting, squeezing
and rolling up change into those impossibly
small paper wrappers, and then having to stand in long lines at banks for the
equivalent amount in bank notes; an apparatus that changes change into cash
while you play pokemon. [SK]

Century by  Max G. Oxydyl for his washing soap product, which was not as
successful a product as his special socks for soldiers in cold war
zones. [SR]

42. (n) the scab on top of a syphilitic chancre located in the genital region;

were concealed by the manufacturers Eli Glaxy and the drug

The US or Europe. Prydxline hydrochloride is now used as an ingredient in the
manafacture of flame retardant seating in aircraft. [AM]

There's a line of "Dirty Girl" cosmetics, but do Bataille characters
count?

Then there's the problem of the actual cosmetics and soap, which are
about packaging.  There was a line of cosmetics at a mall store I don't
know exists anymore called Spencer.  These are what I would expect:
burgundy colored cherry chocolate flavored high gloss lip gloss in black
octagonal pots.  These are probably "trashy", not dirty, though.

I suppose a well matched human hair mustache applied with spirit gum,
even after Shakespeare in Love, is still far more disturbing than any
amount of glittery blue eye shadow.

Some of Laure's poems from the collected writings were published at Apex
of the M before they showed up in book form.

 Poevisioni
Video, Computer & Web Poetry
Curator: Caterina Davinio


In the Sixties the linearity of the poetic text was fragmented,
deconstructed, broken thanks to the ironic, playful intervention of
desecration of the visual and performative poets. At the same time continued
the research of the pioneers of the international electronic art, but the to
ambits remained mainly separated, and the performance saw, at the beginning
of the Nineties, still the centrality of the performer body, when, in the
electronic art, the artists already began to speak about the concept of
collective author, also referring to the web-art. I direct my attention
toward those video and computer artist (recently CD and web artist) who
tried an experimentation in contact with the poetry text in its larger
conception: as linear, visual, sonore, performative text, founding a new
discourse that I find very interesting also as artist.  The presented
authors come from different experiences: literature, cinema, photography,
visual arts, performance, and, in this variety, they contribute to create an
frontier area of contamination between the languages, that is the
contemporary art. (Davinio)

Negli anni Sessanta la linearit del testo poetico era frammentata,
decostruita, infranta da un impeto dissacratore, ironico, ludico, dai poeti
visivi e performativi. Nello stesso tempo procedeva la ricerca dei pionieri
internazionali delle arti elettroniche, ma i due ambiti rimanevano in
circuiti separati e la performance poetica vedeva in Italia ancora
all'inizio degli anni 90 la centralit del corpo del performer, quando gi
nell'ambito delle arti visive si parlava di realt virtuali, di autore
collettivo, anche in relazione al web. Ho concentrato negli anni il mio
interesse verso quei video e computer artisti, e recentemente autori di CD
d'arte e di web art, che cercano un confronto col testo poetico nella sua
accezione pi ampia: da quello lineare a quello visivo, sonoro,
performativo, gettando le basi per un discorso nuovo che m'interessa anche
come artista.
Gli artisti provengono da esperienze e formazioni diverse: letteratura,
cinema, fotografia, arti visive, performance,e, pur nella
diversit,contribuiscono tutti a creare quel territorio di confine e
contaminazione tra linguaggi che  l'arte contemporanea. (Davinio)

The farewell letter purportedly from Gabriel Garc=EDa M=E1rquez is a =
hoax.  He
didn't write it and has publicly denounced it many times over.  [It has =
been
circulating the internet for several months.]  It is true that he is =
sick
and is writing his memoires.  He is on record as stating that he is
embarrassed that anyone might think he actually wrote that dreadfully
sentimental poem attributed to him!    =20

I didn't think when signing up for poetics list that I was indicating a
preference for a particular genre.  I don't see how poetry can be better
than fiction, because poetry is in fact fiction.  (Wallace Stevens seemed to
think so.)  When I think of Samuel Beckett, I'm not thinking of him as a
dramatist, a poet, or a fiction writer; those distinctions don't mean a
whole lot in this context.  I remember a Spanish friend of mine, when
Octavio Paz, trying to convince him to take sides in a dispute he was having
with Carlos Fuentes, said that he (my friend) should take the side of a poet
against that of a mere novelist.  But for me, novelists and dramatists are
poets, while poets are also "fiction writers."  It doesn't seem useful to me
to say that poetry is "better" in any meaningful sense.

first of all, it was I who dragged the bar so very low, not ron.  however,
what i suggested were allegations that have been collected from various
police ledgers across the country and written off as bizarre.  please note i
said "allegedly."

i took particular offense at the darger post when it was suggested he was a
pedophile.  the heuristic used to reach the rather specious conclusion that
darger was a pedophile is nothing like the criteria used to form the
allegation about HW.  the stuff about darger is based on knee-jerk repressed
reaction to rather unusual drawings; whereas the evidence about bush's
alleged pedophilia comes from a number of police reports over a course of 15
years or so from different locations across the country.  all reports came
from children who were reported missing and later returned home, with
stories that were considered as shockingly imaginative.

"Patrick, the intention of your
would-be "mudslinging" is to ~prove~
your liberalism, unexamined use of
maligned stereotypes like this easy
joke's seems very ill-considered, if not
yahoo. The successful propagation of
the "monster" image you are
reenforcing has been a key tactic of the
"repressive" regimes' propaganda that
you're trying to puncture, may I remind
us."

uh, you are incorrect.  you cannot read my mind, and it seems proven by your
statement in quotes above.  you share no insight into my motivations.  i
might be a bit yahoo, though.

are you familiar with bush family funding for genocidal programs during the
last 70 years or so across the world?  the bushes are monsters.  samuel
prescott helped make sure there was a war in germany and sent hitler piles
of moolah before he had any followers.  monsters.  the FUCKERS made sure to
start a war so they could make piles of money for Brown Brothers Harriman
and their holding companies.  that is monstrous.  they continued to supply
resources to the nazis through 1943.  monsters.  i don't know if you are
familiar with the history of the cia, or the history of cocaine and heroin
running in america for the last 40 years, or a big savings & loan crisis, or
the iran contra affair, or so many things, but i can safely say this guy
qualifies as a monster.  bushes seem to be monsters.  if anything, if HW
were a child molester that might actually dilute his monster standing.
there might be something profoundly tragic about the guy.

as far as dumya goes, other than his ability to loot the texas population as
the texans smile (the rangers' stadium, anyone) I have no idea how much of a
monster he is.  unlike his daddy or granddaddy, i don't think dumya is smart
enough to be a monster.  he'll hire monsters instead, because to him it's
like being back in a frat or some silly shit.

wake up and smell your own breath.  i certainly have no need to "prove my
liberalism."  evidence?  the most economically and militarily right-wing
presidency America has seen is the clinton administration.  33 military
deployments, nafta and the wto add up to that.  reagan and bush combined
mustered only 6 military deployments, in comparison.  i ain't no
conservuhtive and i ain't no lib neither.

are you skull and bones?  why do you suggest that the allegations i shared
here are "hate mail"?  they are allegations, but not hate mail.  such a
loaded phrase, "hate mail."  you could not even pass my words as slander,
much less as "hate mail."

most accusations regarding pedophilia are usually based on a need to slander
people, so i see how you jumped to a rather distant conclusion about my
intent.  i understand that.  you are wrong, however, completely.  i also
would beg to differ with you and suggest that pedophiles are not diseased,
and not to be cured.  sexuality is much more complicated than that.  i see
pedophilia not as a monstrous illness, oh no.  i see it instead as a sort of
patheticness,  a severe sexual statis that has hints of despotic behavior.
i am a big fan and i see none of that in darger.  "Lolita" is one of my
favorite novels, and Humbert Humbert is marked by these very traits of
sexual stasis (brought on by a childhood trauma) and a need for despotic
control.  but i do not see pedophilia as necessarily "monstrous."  as an
example, I would point you to a Louis Malle film, "Le Souffle au coeur."

the bush family helped start the first castration/eugenics program in
America, with the Gray family, in Winston-Salem, NC.  there's your
castration for you.

i think you managed to jump to some rather silly and needless conclusions
about me and my intentions.  and to lump ron's name here where this was
obviously my responsibility is misguided at best.

if george herbert walker bush is a pedophile and he is not living under the
terror that you suggest, then he is probably living under the fed-form of
terror that i originally suggest.  but the bushes, and the people they
represent, deserve all shame and scorn.  bloody monarchs.  i thought we were
rid of monarchy in america.  i thought wrong.

i will avoid judgments as to why you feel a need to protect the monarchs.

Patrick/Ron:

I must object that the popular slurs in
your message (>>HW allegedly has a
taste for 12 year old boys, a nasty
nocturnal leftover from his Andover
days,<< etc., below) is a recurrence of
a particular type of
sex-prejudice/vilification that has
passed uncontested in this Poetics List
before.  Recently, it was the artist
Henry Darger whom people here were
similarly taking stabs at this way (re:
pedophilia/pederasty).

Anyone objecting (like me) is of course
placed in the untenable, NAMBLA-ish
position of trying to defend a universal
pariah figure,--- but especially in a
public literary/intellectual forum such as
this where, Patrick, the intention of your
would-be "mudslinging" is to ~prove~
your liberalism, unexamined use of
maligned stereotypes like this easy
joke's seems very ill-considered, if not
yahoo. The successful propagation of
the "monster" image you are
reenforcing has been a key tactic of the
"repressive" regimes' propaganda that
you're trying to puncture, may I remind
us.

The pederasts ("chicken hawk") or
pedophiles whom you're sideswiping
are ~real~ people, who by and large
"suffer from" a condition,--- one that
has shown to be quite unresponsive to
all therapies, with almost 100%
recidivism.  Your scarecrow "chicken
hawk" here has been the hot-bed, as it
were, of nation-wide "rightist" legal
extremism: the East Coast Megan Law,
California legislation toward chemical
castration of sex offenders, web "Most
Wanted" galleries where the identity
and ~addresses~ of the convicted are
to be posted, etc., etc.  I'm surprised
that your frame of reference could be
so narrow as not to know of, personally
by way of social contacts, the terror
that pederasts/pedophiles live under,
constant anxiety over arrest, divided
will, etc.

You are dragging the bar of discussion
extremely low. This, Henry Darger, ---
go on --- Lewis Carroll?  Nabokov?

--- Chris (Charles B?), I thought the
exclusion of such "hate mail" was one
of the agreed-upon justifications for a
List-monitor.

To say nothing of Andover...!

12 year old boys, a nasty nocturnal

that he does some serious covert work
on
satisfying those tastes?  it certainly
helps to have a man in power who has
a certain weakness...it could make him
very controllable, just as it could
make him very controlling.

Richard,

Actually, it was Mr Baker I was thinking
off when I used the term thug, tho
Mr Cheney comes equally to mind. I
haven't figured out what to make of Mrs
Rice -- she has that "deer caught in the
headlights" look every time I see
her on the news, a feature she shares
with George W.

Speaking of whom (W, that is), I do
have some friends who are members of
the
Bush clan & what they say about that
whole side of the family is far worse
than anything anyone has posted here,
or is likely to.

One more thing.
The continued attacks on Conservative
persons and institutions by members of
this community, as if it were mere
sport, divides and alienates, it rivens
society and poisons the common spring
of language.  It is a bullying
behavior because it does not permit a
comeback from the other quarter.  Your
wits drive full blast down one way
streets and run over pop up targets
again
and again.  The use of "thugs" to
describe people like Mrs. Rice, a
professor at Stanford, is simply
shameless.  Shame on you, Ron
Silliman.
You really don't know the quality of
person you insult.  Shame.

 Poevisioni
Video, Computer & Web Poetry
Curator: Caterina Davinio


In the Sixties the linearity of the poetic text was fragmented,
deconstructed, broken thanks to the ironic, playful intervention of
desecration of the visual and performative poets. At the same time continued
the research of the pioneers of the international electronic art, but the to
ambits remained mainly separated, and the performance saw, at the beginning
of the Nineties, still the centrality of the performer body, when, in the
electronic art, the artists already began to speak about the concept of
collective author, also referring to the web-art. I direct my attention
toward those video and computer artist (recently CD and web artist) who
tried an experimentation in contact with the poetry text in its larger
conception: as linear, visual, sonore, performative text, founding a new
discourse that I find very interesting also as artist.  The presented
authors come from different experiences: literature, cinema, photography,
visual arts, performance, and, in this variety, they contribute to create an
frontier area of contamination between the languages, that is the
contemporary art. (Davinio)

Negli anni Sessanta la linearità del testo poetico era frammentata,
decostruita, infranta da un impeto dissacratore, ironico, ludico, dai poeti
visivi e performativi. Nello stesso tempo procedeva la ricerca dei pionieri
internazionali delle arti elettroniche, ma i due ambiti rimanevano in
circuiti separati e la performance poetica vedeva in Italia ancora
all'inizio degli anni 90 la centralità del corpo del performer, quando già
nell'ambito delle arti visive si parlava di realtà virtuali, di autore
collettivo, anche in relazione al web. Ho concentrato negli anni il mio
interesse verso quei video e computer artisti, e recentemente autori di CD
d'arte e di web art, che cercano un confronto col testo poetico nella sua
accezione più ampia: da quello lineare a quello visivo, sonoro,
performativo, gettando le basi per un discorso nuovo che m'interessa anche
come artista.
Gli artisti provengono da esperienze e formazioni diverse: letteratura,
cinema, fotografia, arti visive, performance,e, pur nella
diversità,contribuiscono tutti a creare quel territorio di confine e
contaminazione tra linguaggi che è l'arte contemporanea. (Davinio)

Subject:      RealPoetik

Albion Moonlight (Tekton Mantis?) at solipsis@hevanet.com wrote to
complain/rant about the poetry/book contest at Fence Magazine, which
RealPoetikers were informed of last week.  The problem was the fact
that Allen Grossman is judging (RealPoetik knew nothing of
Mr. Grossman).

Turns out  Allen Grossman has been described by Harold Bloom as "one
of our most disturbing and humanly gifted poets." This is not a good
sign.  "Grossman...graduated from Harvard in 1954..." (bad sign)
He is currently Mellon Professor in the Humanities at Johns Hopkins
University..." (another bad sign) "...(and) author of seven books
of poetry....His most recent book of critical work is The Long
Schoolroom: Lessons in the Bitter Logic of the Poetic Principle....
Awards include the Guggenheim Fellowship, the Witter Bynner Prize
of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters," (very
bad sign), "and the MacArthur Fellowship." (Kiss of death).


What ticked Albion off, however, were comments regarding Ezra Pound
and a proposed direction for lit production.  Albion writes: "the way
mr. grossman says "important poet" or pound "shouldve been hanged
just strikes me as too facile and onesided..and really just dumb.."

Albion has been kind enough to send us the original Grossman interview
(so you can judge for yourself) as well as some commentary verse/
rant that he responded with.  Herewith included.  Poem first.




Fuck Academic poetry and Fuck Allen Grossman


I think I am beginning to enjoy
being an outsider in all the art-cultures,
but for those of you wanting to get in..
one more poetry contest..
Bloom lauds Grossman
so he must be good
Bloom being the ultimate reader
or so he tells us
Grossman calls for a poetry of catastrophe
and  blah blah blah..
fuck these academics
I done had school from the Poet Laureate of Texas
James Hoggard
He called me a solipsis-t
and that my friend is what I am
I think I'd rather read douglas p.
and get drunk on the week-ends as usual..
but thats just me (i'm a closet painter)
I'm really into the catastrophe
(I like the way it looks)
its lurid and beautiful
Hitler killed 6 million Jews
Stalin killed Ten million folks of some kind
and still we are overrun with idiots
population is marching on
You can't even read a book by Pentii Linkola in English
but Allen Grossman can go on all week about catastrophe poetry
and how Pound is an anti-semite traitor
and I quote "that shouldve been hanged"
Is that what pound was?
I think youre just another Gorgon Allen Grossman
turning being to stone
just another reductionist
in a sea of reductionists
riding your dumb patchwork hobby-horse thru history
like you owned it..
Fuck you Allen Grossman
I might weep for the rainforrest
but I dont give a fuck about your poetry

Subject: Harvard poetry festival

(RealPoetik Editor's Comment:  It's a wonderful example of academic
writing of a sort, kind of the academic equivilant of Rush Limbaugh,
whose newsgroup is aptly subtitled "The newsgroup for the derogation
of everyone.)



      In this interview with The Harvard Advocate, Grossman discusses =
the
      progress of American and English poetry since the High Modern =
period. He
      suggests that poetry still has not adequately addressed the =
cultural
      problems demonstrated by the Holocaust and World War II, and that =
no
      poetry has arisen to supplant Ezra Pound's traitorous and =
Anti-Semitic
      account of history.

      Neal Eckard: You said in a 1981 interview that poetry in America =
was still
      responding to T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Is that still the case?
      Allen Grossman: It is emphatically the case. Despite the enormous
      distance of many decades between the natural extinguishing of High
      Modernism and our present, almost nothing decisive has happened.
      NE: Not even the work of John Berryman and other writers of his =
time?
      AG: No. I don't consider the poets who are sometimes called the =
"Middle
      Period" decisive. There are persons of great beauty such as =
Randall
      Jarrell. But the only thing that really happened was Elizabeth =
Bishop,
      and the singular character of Bishop as a writer is that one can =
study
      Bishop. And one can fill one's mind with this spectacle of =
enormous
      competence. However, one cannot think about Bishop or think with =
Bishop,
      and only poets with whom you can think, supply a future different =
from
      themselves.

      NE: Can you explain a little more of what you mean by "think with" =
Bishop?
      To "think with" as a consequence of the fact that the problem =
which drives
      the important poet's poem into existence is a problem which is =
common, and
      this problem continues to be common to that writer and to his or =
her
      subsequent audience. What appears to be the case since the High
      Modernists, that is since the death of Eliot, Pound, and [Wallace]
      Stevens' generation, the world of poetic practice has never found =
the
      cultural problem which we discern with sufficient power to =
regenerate the
      poetic practice. The massive fact that there has never been-with =
the
      exception of certain European writers, [Paul] C=E9lan chief among =
them-any
      response in the English-speaking world to the Holocaust or to the =
second
      world war. All the response that came to light or has as yet come =
to eye
      and mind was prepared in the thirties. And the immense novelty of =
the
      problem of history with respect to human value has not yet been =
seized
      upon by the poet in time. Since the death of C=E9lan in 1970 we =
[poets
      representing this time period] have become quite invisible. Hence =
all the
      anxiety of making the period between 1933 and 1946 visible by =
other means.
      What I'm trying to suggest is the absence of a poetics answerable =
or
      adequate to history has blocked the rise of any new significant =
exploit.
      One must bear in mind that the most responsive, the most profound =
response
      to the period between '33 and '46 was the response of an =
anti-Semitic
      traitor, Pound. The Pisan Cantos are by far the most substantial, =
the
      most profound response.=20
      We are still inheritors of High Modernism. There has been found no =
way to
      address history and poetry in the absence of an answerable =
competence with
      respect to history as empty and without a direction.
      NE: What would constitute strong poetry?
      AG: A strong poetry would be a poetry that discerns and finds a =
poetically
      adequate means of bringing to mind the catastrophe of history.=20

      This has not arisen since history's greatest catastrophe, World =
War II.=20
      NE: So what was it that the writers in the twenties and thirties =
were
      seeing?=20
      AG: What gave rise to their particular practice, which we call =
High
      Modernism, is of great interest to me. Europe and America simply =
revived
      the notions of what was true at the turn of the twentieth century. =
This
      revision of our understanding of what was true generated the =
self-revision
      of the modernist poets in the first and second decades of this =
century.
      This self-revision was practiced almost in unison across the whole
      spectrum of European writing. The significant marking moments are
      well-known: The Neue Gedichte of [Rainer Maria] Rilke. The =
self-revision
      of Yeats in the period after the deliberate, self-marking of the =
poem
      "Adam's Curse". The introduction of American truth in the poetic
      self-revisions that Pound represented in America. The career of =
[William
      Carlos] Williams, which began as a Victorian career, also =
indicates that
      self-revision. In France it is this enormous, and still =
conceptually
      unassessed innovation of surrealism, which incorporates the high =
cultural
      insights that Freud, for example, offered. These discoveries =
seemed to
      have been the only new knowledge that arose-but a sufficient new
      knowledge-such that the High Modern period found its place in the =
history
      of participatory thought.=20
      NE: Where is Robert Frost in all this?
      AG: The Frost contribution in this matter would have been North of =
Boston,
      an insight into the nature of the world, of incommunicable =
experience,
      which Frost never went beyond. Everything after North of Boston =
was a
      withdrawal or a displacement away from poems such as "Servant of
      Servants."
      There was enormous self-revision which was correlative in poetry =
to a
      similar self-revision in anti-metaphysicalism, anti-formalism in
      philosophy, linguists with [Edmund] Husserl's reduction; this was =
the
      correlative discovery of a truth-driven philosophy adequate to our
      requirement for a renewed relationship to truth of benchmarks.
      Pragmatism, particularly the pragmatism of [Charles] Pierce. And =
indeed,
      the neo-Hegelianism for Royce. In science, it was the discovery of
      uncontrollable sources of energy in relativistic physics and =
Einstein's
      papers on the Special and General Theory of Relativity.
      So whatever happened that affects the capacity of persons to make =
moral
      judgments and to convey these judgments in representations of a =
poetic
      kind, it happened prior to 1932, prior to the elections of =
Roosevelt and
      Hitler. And our ability to recover a relationship to history that =
is
      intelligible and can in fact serve as common knowledge between us =
and our
      children-common knowledge of what constitutes a human problem and =
what
      constitutes an adequate statement of that problem, a poetic =
statement-has
      not arisen.
      The problem of a discourse designed to bring mind and history in a =
single
      gaze-that is, poetic discourse-finding itself or being found out =
as
      inadequate to what the consciousness knows is the modernist =
problem. The
      answer to the question that was generated as to what the cause of =
violence
      might be was stated univocally: the cause of violence lies in
      representation itself. This was Rilke's interpretation of his own =
death.
      This is what brought Yeats' work to an end before he died, =
specifically
      Yeats' "Cuchulain Comforted" and "Black Tower." It is the tower at =
the
      end of the world, having withdrawn from the questions which =
history
      required the poet to answer, having withdrawn in the hope that a =
hundred
      years in the tomb might make it possible to generate a more =
adequate mind
      than the extravagant practices of the High Modern period one takes =
with
      it. Completely apparent catastrophe of dimensions for which there =
was no
      representational correlative. Since he knew so much about history =
and
      what was about to happen, Yeats had full consciousness of the =
inadequacy
      of his resources for that task in 1937-38.
      What the sixties made unmistakable was the inherent ambivalence of =
poetic
      powers. The Yeats of "On the Boiler" and the Yeats of "Cuchulain
      Comforted" are contemporaries of one another, they're the same =
man. "On
      the Boiler" marks Yeats as a eugenics master, as an Anti-Semite, =
as a man
      violently opposed to the very existence of the lower classes, as a =
man
      traitorous to the kind of humanity that he appears to have. He =
glorified,
      as Pound did, the notion of the inevitability of the poet as the =
wholly
      ambivalent figure-the figure whose devotion to representation has =
rendered
      him a criminal and whose devotion to humanity has been the motive =
for his
      devotion to representation. Yeats is the poet caught in a paradox =
of
      vastly greater historical proportions but in the same logical =
structure as
      Blake discovered. The master from whom we can renew our motive to =
poetry
      is Blake. The effort to consider Wordsworth and to learn from him =
has
      failed.
      The modern masters are our only masters. We began this discussion =
by
      observing that. The characteristic Postmodern discovery is that =
the
      modern master is purely ambivalent. Pound was a traitor; he should =
have
      been hanged.
      NE: Well, he's pretty lucky he wasn't.
      AG: Is it lucky? He had finished the Pisan Cantos, what else did =
he have
      left to do? Those who loved him, perhaps, were fortunate. Pound =
was
      seditious and an anti-Semite who betrayed his country in time of =
war. And
      it is Pound who has left us the richest of the analytic accounts =
of the
      twentieth-century. His account is like the Virgilian account of =
the
      founding of Rome by the defeated in the Trojan wars. As predicted =
by
      Hegel in Lordship and Bondage, the master account in the immediate
      post-war period of the history just survived is by a seditious =
mind.
      NE: Has Pound sapped trust for artists and the sense of community =
among
      poets?
      AG: Well, that's because we're so faint-hearted. It is possible =
that what
      we have been taught, that whatever constitutes art, what art does, =
cannot
      be and could never be understood as simply for or simply against =
our
      humanity. What Blake predicted, namely that art was pure =
ambivalence, had
      the same character of sanctity: "The Lord kills and the Lord =
maketh alive;
      blessed be the Lord." Art indeed partakes in the nature of history =
and if
      it overcomes, it overcomes by reason of consciousness of that pure
      ambivalence, which I think the poetic community has been unable to =
endure.
      So my sense of the problem in the poetic community is that it has =
been
      thoroughly taken over by an obligation to civility; this is =
mistaken.
      What one must rediscover is what Blake and Homer knew: the pure
      ambivalence of the practice. The idea of workshops has become =
almost
      expectable, but the great representation of the workshop of the
      imagination was Blake's account of the workshop of Los, which was =
a place
      of huge and murderous energies.
      Today, the function of workshops is by and large to regulate art =
so that
      it can't do anything. The civility of the institution (the =
university)
      which provides the occasion for the workshop has repressed all =
useful
      outcomes
      NE: Is it an unbalanced patron-artist relationship?
      AG: Oh yes, well the relation of the artist to the means of =
production has
      become absolutely a patronage relationship. Presses publish poetry =
as a
      patronage act, and the university hosts poetry as an act of =
patronage.
      The weakness of poetry and the greater strength of the fiction =
world at
      the present moment is the result of the sad reversal that we speak =
of [the
      movement of poetry out of the market economy]. It does not mean =
that
      universities are meaningless for the poet. They are meaningful as =
a place
      of analysis, study, and the maintenance or the continuity of =
textual
      tradition. But universities are not a site for the production.
      NE: There's not a university capable.
      AG: No, logically there isn't. No university capable of =
maintaining its
      own status in a civil world would be performing a function =
appropriate to
      universities. Professors are, in effect, the histories and logics =
of the
      culture. Poets have always been and must now come once again to be
      thoroughly learned persons, but as a basis for the production for =
poetry,
      the university is not the right place.
      For many years, the basis of poetry has announced itself-in the =
university
      and perhaps in the inner nature of people for whom poetry is =
important-by
      instituting a central past, a poetic predecessor upon whom it was =
possible
      to repose confidence, as one reposes confidence on the paradigms =
from
      which one must make new objects. For many years, the paradigmatic
      representative has been Wordsworth. My view is that that has been =
a very
      unproductive reliance.
      NE: Why is that?
      AG: For the simple reason that Wordsworth's civility isn't =
inclusive
      enough to declare the full complexity of the poetic subject =
matter.
      Appropriate, since it is the business of any poetic culture to =
construct
      its past, to locate the past as an active attention in the vast =
though
      finite array, a principle of genealogical origination. Unlike =
natural
      birth, the "born" person can choose his symbolic past. He can =
choose his
      symbolic nature. The world which I would like to conduct into =
existence
      would not be Wordsworth's. The master, the artist, the poet whose
      workshop we need to reconstruct is Blake. The reason we need to
      reconstruct Blake's workshop is that it was uncolored and =
untouched by the
      aesthetic conception. Blake was the inheritor of a Protestantism =
that
      contributed the most vital poetry and the most vital philosophy in =
the
      period after the intervatory religious reconstruction of Luther =
and
      Calvin. It was Luther and Calvin who contributed that readiness =
for
      Modernism. Blake was the last Muggletonian.=20
      For Blake, it was not a workshop of poems, but a workshop of the
      imagination, in effect, a workshop of Jerusalems, that is to say, =
a
      workshop of symbolic cultures that made a difference. The =
conception of
      the workshop as it is now understood is a manufactory of aesthetic =
objects
      that is subject to the constraints and the critique of reference =
that the
      aesthetic conception has made obligatory. But for Blake, forms =
were
      beside the point. His vast conception, and his truth-bearing =
conception
      of the imagination, was that insofar as the artistic form of words =
was
      concerned the work of the artist was unquestionably a "making." =
And the
      place of his work was a workshop. And what was made were not poems =
but
      poetry, and poetry is for Blake, as it is for all valid poets, a =
theory of
      the assemblage of social formations under the constraint that they =
limit
      destructiveness, so far as destructiveness can be limited. Blake =
had no
      interest in the artifact insofar as the artifact constituted a =
regime
      which was sealed from the work of the world.
      The business of poetry is to produce a language that is not an =
aesthetic
      language. Ordinary languages are aesthetic. Ordinary languages are
      languages of interrupted consequence. Poetic language should be a
      language of transitivity, of uninterrupted transitivity. So in =
some
      sense, the academy has got it all wrong, as usual.
      Many of our best theorists of the twentieth century considered =
that the
      business of the poet-whose practice is the imagination, whose site =
of work
      is the Los Forge-is to intervene in history. Not on behalf of
      representation as such-
      NE: Which leads to violence.
      AG: Yes, which is the trap in which Yeats, Williams, Rilke, and =
Ginsberg
      found themselves. Ginsberg knew no better. Yeats was from a family =
of
      persons in trade. Yeats had an apprenticeship to materials, an
      apprenticeship not to symbolic goals but to the material goals of =
the
      goldsmith. For Yeats, the act of writing was not for dissemination =
or
      distribution, not part of a Gutenberg galaxy, but was rather part =
of the
      history and theory of the engineer of materials, who goes about =
the
      practice of assemblage from the features of the physical world, =
upon which
      assemblage depends.
      There is no "natural," as Blake observes. Nature, after all, is =
going to
      kill you once in your life, and therefore is not your friend. =
Symbolic
      life is restored to its fundamentally essential role in social =
practice,
      in the construction of social formations. This was Whitman's =
motive.
      Whitman didn't entirely grasp the constraints on construction. =
Whitman
      was willing to enter but not enter fully into the question of how =
poems
      shall be made. Blake's epics were clearly devised to destroy the =
idealism
      of the finished artifact. "Finish" in Blake was the blocking of =
"finish."
      It is singularly the case that Whitman's poetry possesses a dire =
elegance,
      which, for example, Jarrell called "delicacy."
      The "finish" of the poet is to be administered by someone other =
than the
      artist?
      It is at the point of "finish," at the point of closure that the =
violence
      of representation begins to announce itself. The resistance to, or =
the
      repudiation of the idealism of the finished artifact is one of the
      remarkable contributions of some of the poetry of your own time, =
for
      example Susan Howe (incidentally a Harvard product). She is the =
clearest
      voice announcing the possibility of a production that does not =
take as its
      idealism or as its artifactual destiny the poem of closure, the =
poem of
      high finish. Her display is of the breaking regime of the printed =
page in
      her really great work, called The King's Book. Hers is the final
      philosophical iconoclasm that breaks the rigid linearity that =
print
      ideology imposes and the equally rigid circumferentiality of the =
closure
      around it. Hers is the artistic form of languages no longer =
overshadowed
      by the obligation to shut in or shut out.=20
      The problem of iconoclasm is that it doesn't allow the very life =
it seeks
      to liberate. Iconoclasm is a partial thought, an incomplete. the =
breaking
      of images doesn't release us from the necessity of images. The =
images are
      necessary so that we can detect one another, and even more =
urgently so
      that we can see ourselves. So that the Puritanic iconoclastic =
motive,
      which I think is rarely to be found in history, will not serve the
      purposes that I'm concerned with. It's quite striking that =
iconoclastic
      actions tended to deface only part of the image. Iconoclasts =
simply
      replace images of one sort with images of another, as in Islam.
      The past must be constructed out of its own materials. Where do we =
locate
      our preferences in terms of the history of our art? I'm suggesting =
that
      we need in a conscious and insistent way to turn our attention =
away from a
      Wordsworthian idealism that is reflected on every side by =
tradition that
      descends through honorable writers such as Hardy and [Phillip] =
Larkin.
      This tradition has come to the end of its usefulness. We need to =
turn our
      attention to Blake, truly Low Church, rock-bottom, a Muggletonian.
      Our task, sitting here as thinkers not as makers for the moment, =
is in
      effect to collaborate into one cultural project that should be =
engined by
      everyone, that is to say the cultural project that asks: Why do =
they
      suffer? This is a question that generates Biblical text. In Zion, =
the
      answer is "In the Beginning."
      NE: So this is the reason to begin writing?
      AG: I think so, yes. There are lots of other reasons that one must
      tolerate in oneself, and in one's friends and students. But the =
one good
      reason for writing is the initiating perception that there is a =
problem
      which poetry can address. Hence, the destiny of poetry is in hard
      problems. Blake calls this "Mental Height," and it is the poetry =
of
      "Mental Fight" that I should like to be capable of advancing.=20
      NE: What exactly does this have to do with what you do?
      AG: I do, as you do, what I can, and I hope I live long enough to =
do
      better in this matter. Among the recognitions that I think =
necessary to
      begin to do better is to direct my attention toward what I think =
the
      really important problems with respect to this art are. Poems that =
are
      distracting but of complete irrelevance are poems that concern =
questions
      of form.
      NE: This seems to me to be the direction many poets of our time =
have gone,
      Jorie Graham for one.
      AG: It is a reason we could assign to that gesture. I think what =
Jorie
      means and what I mean is that the way in which poetic problems =
were
      posed-such as the difference between closed and open form, or =
formalism
      and anti-formalism, metaphysicalism and anti-metaphysicalism-are =
utterly
      empty of interest and not a proper subject of concern. In some =
deep way,
      it makes no difference how we write. What difference it makes is =
the
      consequence of what follows from what we write.
      NE: Is form a function of the requirements of dissemination?
      AG: No, the requirements of dissemination are quite simply =
relevance. If
      we are not addressing the site of pain, then there is no reason to =
welcome
      our coming. The business of poetry is to build Jerusalem. Which =
one does
      by manufacturing Jerusalem at the point of correspondence between =
the
      desired states of affairs and actuality. Between the image and the
      pattern. Blake's Jerusalem is a historical lesson because it has =
no place
      in time and no property, no question about its contours-it will =
take the
      form of the human face. Blake's Jerusalem is an anthropotheistic =
image.
      The human form is the divine form.
      Meter is in fact the pre-linguistic language which poetry =
remembers. But
      what poetry is, at any given moment, is simultaneously linguistic =
and
      non-linguistic. The artistic form of poetry is in fact the =
predominance
      of the non-linguistic and finally, its disappearance. If we think =
of it
      historically, those knowledges by which we became human, language =
is a
      very late supplement to a humanity that had learned to live and =
not to
      die, in groups and not alone, and undoubtedly, to love one =
another.

of course any good writing is harder than bad
writing - it says w/o going - tho i know plenty
of bad writers who work hard - is hard work a
virtue of work? not to dredge up the muck of an
inspiration / perspiration debate - if there even
is one - i am struck by just how much more a poem
is ruined by an out of place word - how poets
(some anyway - not me, i am admittedly lazy) put
as much energy into a line as some fiction
writers do into whole paragraphs or even chapters
- not that i know the difference between prose
and poetry, like porn - i know it when i see it
still... it is a complement to call a prose work
"poetic" and "lyric" (if you believe the
dustjacket blurbs anyway)but chopping up prose
into lines is the sign of a hack

****

> 2) it [fiction] is harder to write - look at
the collected

of

I disagree. Partly because writing *good*
fiction/narrative prose is very
difficult, time consuming, etc. ... and partly
because I, a poet, love good
fiction. What is good fiction? In the past few
years I've enjoyed reading or
re-reading(off the top of my head in no
particular order) The god of small
things, The passion, The bean trees, An
unfortunate woman (Richard
Brautigan), Short stories by Graham Greene and
John Cheever, ...

But taste aside, I also disagree because I don't
see the point in arguing
this "better/worse" sort of dichotomy, especially
around genre. I find the
distinction between poetry and prose not only
largely useless and irrelevant
but wasteful (except when generating tangents
such as  "Meditation on
Fiction Poetry and Metals"). Writers like Carla
Harryman, who intentionally
blur and break the rules/boundaries of such
distinctions excite me. Like
Hamlet, I prefer to read "words, words, words" --
provided said words have
been placed on the page (or the screen) with some
semblance of wit and/or
intelligence.

Yes, Jonathan, there is nothing meaningful in making a quality comparison
between any two general abstract categories.  Or else  we are faced with the
conclusion that Shakespeare was better than Shakespeare.  And worse than
Shakespeare.  Because writing poetry makes you a better writer than writing,
say, drama.  So shakespeare the poet was better than shakespeare the
dramatist?  this question is so silly.    apples make better fruit than
bananas?  huh?  that question makes no sense.

Contemporary fiction writing is caught up in nominalist to a snoozifying
extreme; i cannot believe the success of writers who find it important to
express every detail of a room down to the last molecule.  to me that is a
waste of paper, no matter what the style.  but that apparently makes for
good literature these days.  and poetry, we either have quasi-nominalist
navel gazing or nonsensical veiled-modernist "experimentation" with syntax,
which has certainly run its course, leaving us no different, with no
universal understanding of language.  it does not leave us with a universal
justification for nominalism either.  However, my description here reveals
nothing about the standing of novels and poetry books as compared to each
other.

As for me, I am embarking on a period of dramatic writing after "learning"
from working on and finishing two volumes of poetry and multimedia lit &
design.  And someday I will probably return to writing poetry.  And leave it
again.  (I will perhaps never really stop writing poetry.)  Writing is
writing, and all writing can have art as an option.  Most writing, poetry
and fiction or whatever categorical breakdown you wish for, has zero art.

Moby Dick and Oedipus at Colonnus are for me the pinnacle of tragic poetic
inspiration for me; the former, a novel, and the latter, drama.  And my
synthesis of this material will be drama, conventionally speaking, but I
aspire that it will also be poetry, than the beauty of the language will
match, rise and fall, with the intensity of the scene.

In all honesty this question, the better is poetry or novels, etc., is a
silly question, as most of us with any gray matter realize.  In my perhaps
narcotic optimism, I think many people that have replied with partiality are
having fun with supplying playful responses.  When I originally responded, I
thought I responded appropriately, as appropriateness requires that dumb
questions get dumb answers.  I would assume others translate stupidity in
the same way I have.  Or there are more idiots in this group than I can
possibly fathom.  Which in turn makes me a fool.

I cannot believe so much has been said about this subject, on this list,
even by me.

Subject: Is an epigram better than an ode


I didn't think when signing up for poetics list that I was indicating a
preference for a particular genre.  I don't see how poetry can be better
than fiction, because poetry is in fact fiction.  (Wallace Stevens seemed to
think so.)  When I think of Samuel Beckett, I'm not thinking of him as a
dramatist, a poet, or a fiction writer; those distinctions don't mean a
whole lot in this context.  I remember a Spanish friend of mine, when
Octavio Paz, trying to convince him to take sides in a dispute he was having
with Carlos Fuentes, said that he (my friend) should take the side of a poet
against that of a mere novelist.  But for me, novelists and dramatists are
poets, while poets are also "fiction writers."  It doesn't seem useful to me
to say that poetry is "better" in any meaningful sense.

There have apparently been a series of controversies surrounding the two
FENCE book competitions, but these are apparently taking place mostly as
New York poetry gossip, and I have no information.  Therefore, I don't
know why these particular book competitions have become so
controversial.  Rebecca seems nice enough.  Allen Grossman judged last
year's Colorado Review book prize, apparently to silence.  He chose
Sally Keith, and the one poem on the Colorado Review site seems
philosophical, religious, and Dickinson "updated" by mentioning double
wides.

I read _Bitter Logic_ and that's pretty much what it seemed.  Pound is
of course an explosive topic on this list especially.  BTW, during the
convention, there's a sale for MLA members at Alphaville.

I suppose I've been caught at being naive about poetry again, except I
would like to point out that not all competitions disclose judges'
names, as if the judge does not matter, and that the other FENCE contest
did not make such a disclosure (at least to my knowledge).

Hey Tisa,

I think Simple Passion is a great book. Backchannel and tell me what you
think of it (once you read it Tisa, or anyone else), or if you want to hear
more about my take on it. Her books about her parents (A Woman's Place and
A Man's Story, or maybe it's vice versa, I don't have them handy) are
pretty great too, and might be more of what you're looking for (I don't
know why you're wanting to read Ernaux). Her other books about herself,
aside from Simple Passion, I started to find a bit tiresome (Cleaned Out, A
Frozen Woman, Exteriors). Then again, that's also the order I read the
books in, so maybe it's one of those things where you fall in love with the
voice and like best whatever you read first.

Happy holidays,
Damion

I never suggested that George senior was a chicken hawk. Mass murder,
perhaps, but on the other topic, I have no data.

this is to let folks know that i've extended the reading period for two of
the issues of  CATALYTIC until january 31, 2000;  issue #1 on experiment and
issue #3 on/by heteronyms.  also i'm pleased to announce that issue #2 is
co-edited with susan clark. lissa wolsak, who was to co-edit this issue, had
to drop out due to her health being 'temporarily in jeopardy.'

good things are cooking with all three issues.  i hope to serve it up
sometime around march/april.   - randy prunty

CATALYTIC

A new print magazine of poetry, poetics, and visual art,

      CATALYTIC exists to encourage poets and textual artists to take risks
in discovery.

The first three issues will be published simultaneously Spring 2001.  Work
will be considered through January 31, 2001.  Each issue will have a specific
focus:

#1  Experiment.  Work that the writer/artist feels is different from their
normal way of doing things.  Maybe using a different medium or procedure, or
investigating some concerns that they haven't worked with before.  Maybe the
experiment didn't work, or didn't get completed, but somehow it's in the
process of intriguing, making possible.

#2  Women authors.  Co-edited with Susan Clark.  Written or visual language
art that dares to be unusual; that seeks to be radical AND significant.

#3  Heteronyms.  Work created by a heteronym, faux-personality, alias,
alter-ego, etc.  In the publication a brief biography of the heteronym will
take the place of the author's actual name.


Send poetry, essays, visual art (black and white), or some transgression of
all three, to

The farewell letter purportedly from Gabriel Garc?a M?rquez is a hoax.  He
didn't write it and has publicly denounced it many times over.  [It has been
circulating the internet for several months.]  It is true that he is sick
and is writing his memoires.  He is on record as stating that he is
embarrassed that anyone might think he actually wrote that dreadfully
sentimental poem attributed to him!

calligraphic iii (the riddle)


calligraphic ideogrammar doesn't move, carries the dynamic within the
page, tendrils beneath the surface, holding the fastness of the ink, styl-
us cuneiform tending towards the impress of musculature upon the substrate
of clay, one follows the muscles in both, incisions, pronouncements, only
in writing can everything find embodiment - that is its primary, many into
one, in this instance even the proper name a universal, reading bodies in
the shimmerings, coalescence to unity, holding their own (obsessive-com-
pulsive neurosis of the name) - this primary as in, four arms of the mas-
culine body, as in - enshrouding mist, music and chant, sound and glad
tidings, sonorous quoting or citing, concealed and seal, addiction and
habitual craving, in the depth of the night, pornographic and luxurious,
loose and idle, feminine principle or moon, the shade of a tree north of a
hill or south of a river, the negative ion, private parts of a woman -
pressure of seal against the flesh of a screen, page of a body, screen of
a page - the speech of the writing crawling across the surface of a stone,
the cut of the crawl or double-stroke of the crawl, impress of the flow,
the residue of musculature, memory of the sign, sign of the memory - move-
ment of ideogrammar, movement of calligraphic - uncarrying dynamic beyond
the page, tendrils gone from the surface, ink spilling out

Aldon,

Thanks for the plug for my book -- only I don't think people on the
list even know it exists.  Write a review, why dontcha?  Your reading
of the Supreme Court decision is disheartening -- but true.  However,
it doesn't mean we can't try to challenge the creeps with equal
protection cases.  Now's the time to start a Voting Rights Party with
a platform of overhauling the electoral system (campaign finance
restrictions, anti-interference with the vote, proportional
representation a la Lani Guinier, etc.).  Are you ready to join?

Take care,

Hilton

This is a very beautiful collection of insights, and the students are
clearly excited, perceptive, and really cooking.  But I don't think
that it proves such a qualitative difference between poetry and
fiction.  "Fiction is about poetry.  Not all fiction has a truth or
meaning.  Fiction queries words. . .," etc.  While poetry tends to
collect around the extremes of these insights (e.g. in general poetry
has greater affect and effect but not always), there are too many
exceptions, even when it comes to line breaks.  Certainly, writing
fiction is only more "formulaic" if you are writing according to a
formula or inadvertently or not following narrative conventions.  Bad
fiction and bad poetry share the same tendencies to formula.  Can
anyone tell me there are no "formulas" for poetry?  Even, may I
suggest, experimental poetry?  Formulas or conventions or
expectations are always arising in all writing -- and are used or
subverted depending on the circumstances and consciousness of the
writer (and reader).  I don't want to belabor the point, but poets
have a tendency to regard themselves as doing something so very
different from every other writer that it creates barriers.  Was it
Pound who said poetry should be as well written as prose?

> MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -- A poem published in several Latin American newspapers this week and said to be a farewell ode by Colombia's ailing Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez turned out on Wednesday to be the work of a little-known ventriloquist.
> The poem titled "La Marioneta" -- "The Puppet" -- appeared under Garcia Marquez's name on Monday in the Peruvian daily La Republica. Mexico City dailies reproduced it on Tuesday and it was read on local radio stations.
> "Gabriel Garcia Marquez sings a song to life," read a headline in Mexico City's La Cronica, which on Tuesday published the poem superimposed on a photo of the novelist on its front page.
> "My God, if I had a bit of life I would not let one instant go by without telling the people I love that I love them," read the sentimental poem that also circulated on the Internet.
> But like the speech supposed to have been given by U.S.
> novelist Kurt Vonnegut in 1997 urging graduates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to use sun screen, the author of "La Marioneta" turn out not nearly as famous as advertised.
> "I'm feeling the disappointment of someone who has written something and is not getting credit," ventriloquist Johnny Welch told Mexico's InfoRed radio on Wednesday.
> Welch, who has worked for 15 years as a ventriloquist in Mexico and other parts of Latin America, said he wrote the poem for his puppet sidekick "Mofles."
> "I'm not a writer," he confessed.
> In 1997 a humor column by Chicago Tribune columnist Mary Schmich was widely redistributed on the Internet, but was incorrectly billed as an MIT commencement address by Vonnegut.
> Garcia Marquez won the Nobel prize for literature in 1982. His seminal work, "100 Years of Solitude," has been translated into 36 languages and sold millions of copies worldwide.
> In an October 1999 interview with New Yorker magazine, the 73-year-old author acknowledged having been treated for lymphatic cancer in the summer of 1999 in Los Angeles. Rumors of his failing health have surfaced several times in Latin America in recent months.
> Garcia Marquez did not comment publicly on the apocryphal poem, but several close associates denied he had anything to do with it. "It's a shame there are such good forgeries of paintings but such lousy forgeries of literature," Argentine author Tomas Eloy Martinez told Mexico City's Reforma newspaper.

Dear Poetics List,

I don't have that much time to read the list these
days but I have found some of the postings about
proving poetry over fiction pretty amusing. Also,
whoever it was that mentioned _Wittgenstein's
Mistress_ THANK YOU! I bought that a few days ago and
I'm really loving it.

Do we need to see poetry and fiction as distinct
things? I read _Ulysses_ a few months ago and thought
it a wonderful poetry experience. Carole Maso's novel
_AVA_ struck me much the same way a year or so ago
(that too was the recommendation of a poet).

I need to read the rest of the thread on this I guess
but I wondered if anyone had already or would mind
cataloging some other novels of poetic brilliance for
me (whether to me directly or to the list). Perhaps
others would be interested too? If this has already
been done and I just haven't read that far yet, please
forgive the repetition.

Sincerely,
Marla Jernigan

Oh well, here's more DC @ Lib of Con doings courtesy of the New York Times:

WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 — David Ferry accepted the Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt
National Prize for Poetry at the Library of Congress on Monday night, and
the founder of the award, Philip C. Bobbitt, was asked to reflect on why a
poetry prize was even necessary.  "Artists generally, and poets especially,
are like secret agents behind enemy lines sending signals back to
headquarters, and they never know if anything's getting through," Mr.
Bobbitt said. "Their mission isn't completed until they know that it has
struck home in a way that moves people. This ratifies it." Mr. Bobbitt's
comparison to secret agents was apt, given his background. He is a national
security specialist who has served in the Carter, Bush and Clinton
administrations and a constitutional law professor at the University of
Texas, where he holds the A. W. Walker Centennial Chair. Mr. Ferry's work
was ratified with the Bobbitt Prize of $10,000 for his book "Of No Country I
Know: New and Selected Poems and Translations" (University of Chicago Press,
1999). Mr. Bobbitt endowed the prize in memory of his mother, Rebekah
Johnson, who worked at the Library of Congress before her brother Lyndon B.
Johnson entered politics.  Another worker at the library was O. P. Bobbitt,
who wooed Miss Johnson, then engaged to another man, by exchanging love
poems with her that were typed on index cards and slipped past the gaze of a
watchful superintendent. "I had to dislodge her from that fiancé, all under
the eyes of that supervisor," O. P. Bobbitt once told his son. Kenneth Koch,
who won the Bobbitt Prize in 1996, read at the ceremony from his book "To My
Twenties." Robert Pinsky, a former poet laureate, read from his works and
commented, "I don't know of any other literary prize that has such a high
standard." The works on which the prizes are based are written in the two
years before each award. As a result, while this is the prize's 10th year,
the works represented go back 12 years; James Merrill was the first winner.
Unlike most other arts awards, the Bobbitt requires the winner to perform,
so Mr. Ferry, a professor emeritus at Wellesley College, read from his works
of poetry and translation. He read his poem "Courtesy," which includes this
description of a man and a boy on a basketball court: They're shooting
baskets, amiably and mildly. The noise of the basketball, though startlingly
louder Than the voices of the two of them as they play, Is peaceable as can
be, something like meter. He also read from his translation of "The Art of
Poetry" by Horace, picking selections to fit his audience. "Sensible people
run from the crazy poet," one line read. Another went: "If he catches a man,
he'll read that man to death."

Has this thread been exhausted already?  Here are a few ideas, in any case:

Poetry as a literary medium is being used today, it seems obvious to me, for
increasingly more specialized purposes.  Since modernism, in fact, poetry's
development can be characterized as a series of formal renunciations (not
only of the various tropes of "poetic language" per se--but, more
critically--renunciations of narrative and, for lack of a better word,
"argument").  This is true equally, I think, of both "alternative" and
mainstream poetry).  & all of this while the "theory" of poetry--perhaps in
compensation--has become increasingly--& comically--more arcane.  Two recent
poems have suggested this to me w/ particular force.   The first is a longish
prose poem incorporating material from Lewis Carrol, Deleuze, & various other
sources.  What struck me was how diminished the poem seemed in relation to
its appropriations.  It wasn't the poet's fault--the piece was, in its way,
perfectly accomplished--rather it seemed that the genre itself, in its
present state, could not accomodate, or assimilate its sources--which are, in
fact, much more various, complex, and capacious.  The second poem was-- like
a lot of others I've read lately--a gorgeous "knock-off" of Frank O'Hara.
"Better" than O'Hara, actually.  And why not?  His technique has been
perfected with increasing "success" now for the last 35 years.  Gorgeous, in
any case, but completely trivial.  And if triviality was something a lot
*more* than trivial in 1966 (as Paul Carrol argues, for instance), it strikes
me as something a lot *less* than trivial now. These are only highly
subjective responses.  But in both poems, it was the medium that didn't seem
to let the poet fly--this being, of course, the very definition of what is
meant by a *minor* medium (particularly as compared w/ the contemp.
non-mimetic novel--Sebald's novels, for instance, or Gins's, or
Bernhard's--or even the contemporary theater--Richard Foreman comes
immediately to mind).  There are exceptions:  Weiner's 707 Scott Street,
Juliana Spahr's Spiderwasp, Kent Johnson's Yasasuda impersonations, and
others--Gary Sulivan's and Nada Gordon's correspondance, etc.   What all of
these works share is a tendency not to be books of poems at all--or, at least
principally--but rather books which have *assimilated poetry* instead of the
other way around.

The Book as Object and Metaphor in the Digital Age
Friday, Dec. 29, 12 noon -- 1:15pm, Delaware Suite B, Marriott=20
(Washington, DC)

In the course of the modern period, and in particular in the twentieth
century, a self-consciousness about the book as an object, a metaphor,
and an aesthetic instrument has been articulated from a range of
disciplinary perspectives (ethnopoetics, textual criticism, historical
research, artistic expression).  In a recent collection, A Book of the
Book, edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Steven Clay, this interest has
been charted from Edmond Jab=E8s's contention that "the book is as old as
fire and water" to Johanna Drucker's that "the artist's book is the
quintessential 20th-century artform."  The panel attends to that rich
and recently reinvigorated legacy and to the work of poets,  scholars,
critics, and others who have contributed to this conversation, and it
also looks at the ways that current electronic encoding initiatives
force to the fore a set of questions about the metalogics of the book
and page.

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange
arise Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics List was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its second incarnation,
the list carries over 800 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time.
A number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
at the Electronic Poetry Center (see section 10 below).

Please note that this is a private list and information about
the list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list to those with specific
rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale of
the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the increasing
number of subscribers, we are no longer able to maintain the
open format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).
All submissions are reviewed by the moderators in keeping with
the goals of the list, as articulated in this Welcome Message.
We remain committed to this editorial function as a defining
element of the Poetics List. Our aim is to support, inform, and
extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of
the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and
impossible.

For further information on posting to the list, see sections 3 and 4.
below. Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 8.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 8
for details.

We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project. For subscription information
or to contact the moderators, write to <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your full name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list should provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators
at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include all
of the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and send this one-line message, with no "subject" line
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name. If you
find that it is not possible to unsub using your old address,
please contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>
for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your
account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by
contacting the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to ten days, or more, for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by
the moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated
in this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political
activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. Feel
free to query the list moderators if you are uncertain as to whether
a message is appropriate. All correspondence with the editors
regarding submissions to the list remains confidential and should
be directed to us at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published,
or in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core
function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications
are always welcome. We also welcome discussions of poetry and poetics
in keeping with the editorial function of the list.

Solicited contributions (by subscribers or non-subscribers) may
also appear on Poetics from time to time. The moderators reserve
the right to contact any subscriber regarding possible contributions.

Send messages to the list directly to the list address:

     <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list
to our administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 4 below.
Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 9.

-------------------

4. Cautions

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post, since this may make it
difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.
Messages containing attachments will be presumed to be
worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Posting on the list is a form of publication. However, please do
not publish list postings without the express permission of the author!
Copyright for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author;
material from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without
the author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair
use" of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 5 messages
per day from any one subscriber; in general, we expect subscribers
to keep their post to less than 10-15 posts per month. Our goal is
a manageable list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers)
of twenty-five or fewer messages per day.

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or
cause the list to reach its daily limit. These messages are
considered offensive and detrimental to list discussion. Offending
subscribers will receive only one warning message. Repeat offenders
will be removed from the list immediately. Please do not put this
policy to test!

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the moderators at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

5. Subscription Options

It is possible to receive the Poetics List as separate posts
or as daily digests. When you subscribe, the default setting is
"regular," meaning you will receive a separate email for each
message distributed to the list.

Regular:
The default option, this is the form in which you will receive
the list if you choose no other. With a "regular" subscription,
you receive individual postings immediately, as they are OK'd
by the list moderator. To revert to this option if you are
currently receiving the list in digest form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain the following text:

     set poetics nodigest

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

Digest:
With a "digest" subscription, you receive larger messages (called
"digests") at regular intervals, usually once per day. These "digests"
are collections of individual list postings. Some lists are so active
that they produce several digests daily; the Poetics List produces
only one, mailed just after midnight EST.

Digests are a good compromise between reading everything as it is
posted and feeling like the list is clogging your mailbox with a
multitude of individual postings.

To receive the Poetics List in digest form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain the following text:

     set poetics digest

With an "index" subscription, you receive a short "index" message
once per day. These "indexes" show you what is being discussed on
the list without including the text of the individual postings. For
each posting, the date, the author's name and address, the subject
of the message and the number of lines it comprises is listed. You
can then follow instructions provided in the index to download
messages of interest from the server.

An index subscription is ideal if you have a slow connection and
only read a few hand-picked messages. The indexes are very short
and you do not have to worry about long download times. The drawback
of course is that you need to maintain your internet connection or
reconnect to order messages of interest from the server.

You can choose to have the index sent to you in either a traditional
format (plain text) or in HTML format with hyperlinks. Using the HTML
index, you may click on a link provided with each message to open your
web browser to that message in the Poetics List archive.

To receive the Poetics List in index form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain, for the text-only
index:

     set poetics nohtml index

And for the hyper-link index:

     set poetics html index

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

Well, although I tend to agree with your Darwinian commentary here, this
strikes me as an problematic analogy-- 'big old' orchestral music is only a
few hundred years old, as is opera. As is the novel. Poetry, the first form
of literature, is thousands.  By 'literature' I mean, things said in a
particular way and remembered as having been said in that way.  For
millennia poetry was a technology (using alliteration, caesura, parallelism)
that enabled something 'said particularly' to be remembered as such.  In the
early days, poetry enabled literature to exist. As language began to be
recorded, duplicated, and distributed, poetry found an enthusiastic public
and developed greater precision. Homer et al had their day in the sun.  Then
came Chaucer.  Then other technologies came along and made poetry less
necessary: the printing press, the postal system, then the networked
computer. As these technologies have increased in speed and efficiency, the
form of poetry (and all literary art) has degenerated.  Of course it had to:
it was no longer needed.  Poetry is being shed from literature like a
cocoon; is a butterfly emerging? Probably so, but why not wonder?  We who
paint the butterfly's wings must wonder.

That said, any attempt to compare fiction and poetry to determine which is
'better' is admittedly ludicrous; my initial question was facetious, I had
thought, obviously; I don't think that one 'genre' is superior. Though I am
fretting about the present and future of literature, I think not without
good reason. The first round of non-hateful responses to it was exactly what
I was looking for-- Richard's hilarious bit about computer-authors,
Patrick's anecdote about the family dinner table, Mr. Bowering's
declaration.  So the question may stem from a false premise, but the answers
are not all meaningless, as Jacques and Marla have pointed out. So Patrick,
please maintain your 'narcotic optimism'-- and do not doubt anyone's 'gray
matter' -- As Bill put it, a 'fruitless but fun exercise' --

P.S. Does anyone know what the oldest recorded poem is?

Nor were they meant to -- the comments were in response to the what is poetry
question, and students introduced the comparison with fiction, since we'd
struggled a bit with some prose poems vs. some flash fiction which sneaked
into class, so I thought I'd post the comments.

Dear Mr. Dillon,

Hello!  How are you right now?  I am doing well.  Have you written any
poetry lately?

We have this computer game called, "Explorers of the New World."  We can
learn intensely about Columbus, Cortes, and Magellan. We also can learn
about sixty explorers.

Hurrah for Bush!  The Freedom Fighters have defeated the Nazis (excuse me,
Gore camp) twice yesterday (December 5, 2000).  It reminds me of that Civil
War day (July 3, 1863) when the Union defeated the Confederates at
Gettysburg and Vicksburg.

Don't you think it is time for Gore to concede?

Is there a law in the Constitution or the U.S. Code about once you have
conceded anything, you lose rights to it or to a political race?  I believe
there is, for if Britain came back today and tried to take back Northern
Wisconsin or Northern Minnesota, (which it ceded in 1818) it would not be
aloud to have it, because Britain lost its right to the land.  So it is wit=
h
Al Gore.  Since he conceded on November 8th, he should be done.  There
should be no question about it.  On November 8th, he acknowledged Bush as
the winner and gave up his right to contest everything.

----------

Day 22 of election, 11/30/00, Thursday, 5:11 AM

----------
Dear Mr. Dillon,

Have you read the story, "Al Gore's New Ballots"?  Well, in the story they
recount the 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade County that did not have any hole
punched through.  It really ends up that only a Democrat can see the hole
punched: for Al Gore.

Your Knowledge Hungry Friend,

William J. Cass

Dear William,


There are so many laws, William, and so many judges to interpret them, that
it may well be true that there is a statute against a competitor in an
election contest who throws in the towel and then denies that his concessio=
n
counted.  Children do not permit it, why should adults?

Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers:

"Observe the Electoral College in a tempestuous election.  The process may
not be pretty but it is MOST EXCELLENT." (My paraphrase save for the final
superlative.) (Quoted by Florida Secretary of State, Kathryn Harris, to the
Electoral College of Florida, Dec., 17, 2000.)

We do not live in a place called "United Felonious Bastards Registered by

today, dealing with the oncoming Clinton/Gore/Reno Recession due to the
Justice Dept. attack on Microsoft and the Dot.com Crash that started in
March, 2000.  (Mr. Gore told us that he has to mend some fences in Tennesse=

and I am sure he will, unless he fulfills the rest of my prophecy written i=

I don't mind your repetition if you don't mind mine - try Iain Sinclair's
Downriver, Nabokov's Ada, anything by Beckett, James Kelman's How late it
is, how late - there's a short story by Flaubert too, called The Legend of
Julian the Hospitaller (I think), Paddy Clark Hah Hah by Roddy Doyle is also
pretty good - anyone who knows these novels wouldn't call them lyrical (I
tend to run a mile when a blurb begins - a lyrical evocation...) but poetic
as in having the qualities of a poetry? - yes.
Philip Sydney's Arcadia is a bit of fun as well.

Hmm. I read this Albion Moonlight thing, regarding Allen Grossman, but am
unfamiliar with the other controversy. I'd be delighted if someone would
fill me in.

In disclosing our choice of Allen Grossman as judge we were simply relaying
information that was never a secret. The two Fence book competitions are
run in collaboration with two separate organizations. The Alberta Prize is
sponsored by the Alberta duPont Bonsal Foundation, whose representative,
Tom Thompson, will be my co-judge for the final winner. This is not a
secret--we chose not to announce it more in an attempt to avoid many
queries as to who is Tom Thompson and etc.

For the Fence Modern Poets Series Prize, co-sponsors Saturnalia Books and
Fence decided on an "outside" judge, and picked Allen Grossman because we
respect him as a poet and scholar. He will be presented with ten finalist
manuscripts chosen by the editorial staff of Fence from which to select a
winner.

In both of these cases the best guide as to what kind of manuscript we will
be looking for will be to read Fence, the magazine. While our editorial
policy is plurality, we tend to select poems which above all share that
familiar yet evasive quality of idiosyncrasy.

Re:
There have apparently been a series of controversies surrounding the two
FENCE book competitions, but these are apparently taking place mostly as
New York poetry gossip, and I have no information.  Therefore, I don't
know why these particular book competitions have become so
controversial.  Rebecca seems nice enough.  Allen Grossman judged last
year's Colorado Review book prize, apparently to silence.  He chose
Sally Keith, and the one poem on the Colorado Review site seems
philosophical, religious, and Dickinson "updated" by mentioning double
wides.

I read _Bitter Logic_ and that's pretty much what it seemed.  Pound is
of course an explosive topic on this list especially.  BTW, during the
convention, there's a sale for MLA members at Alphaville.

I suppose I've been caught at being naive about poetry again, except I
would like to point out that not all competitions disclose judges'
names, as if the judge does not matter, and that the other FENCE contest
did not make such a disclosure (at least to my knowledge).

i am a research phd candidate.
i am studying the spaces in which poetry exist.
much australian poetry is concerned with mapping landscapes, physical and
psychological.
since composing hypermedia poetry for cyberspace i have started to re-read
published printed poetry and find that whilst most poetry maps a surface of
sorts, there is printed poetry which places me in a space(i think it's
inside my head), a space for logical thought or imagination. there is also
poetry which describes a space 'between' objects, between people rather
than mapping surfaces.

if anyone can suggest theorists who have already identified 'surface' and
'space' in poetry, i would be very grateful.

I don't get it -- what exactly are the
"controversies?"  My email's been fluky lately, so
maybe I just didn't receive the postings in this
thread, but I'm unclear as to what is being questioned
here.

Nester Prydxlowski.   Born: 1880, Lvov, Russia. Died: 1921, Warsawa, Poland.

 Nester Prydxlowski was a Polish anarchist who contributions to word
liberation include various proclamations including, "Meaning-Smeaning."  He
claimed that meaning was the result of the necessity for the bourgeois and
ruling classes to count the number of grain and wine amphorae stored within
their basements.  Further, he is reputed to have written that words of
meaning imprisoned magic, spiritual beings and sound within a tight,
restricted, sadistic slaughterhouse cattle pen, from witch words could only
escape and recommune with the imagination by taking only the most extreme
measures.  He advocated the complete annihilation of poetic text. His
revolutionary tools included instantaneous translation, sound scapes,
consonant string poems and a ruthlessly chaotic river of poetry that would,
that had to, by its nature run over its banks and trap the rich and wealthy
poets of the world on small islands or networks that would be incestuously
poetic. Prydxlowksi's ideas, known as Prydxl, only survive in second hand
accounts. No texts were produced. Nevertheless, Prydxl remains like the
festering wound on the chest of the Christ and is a monument to those who
treasure creativity beyond the mundane and bourgeois notion of poetry.
Prydxlowski decomposed body, which he often referred as his text, was found
in a Tatra mountain forest.

Mother Earth: Cin(E)-Poetry Tour 2001

"Let the voice of the poet be heard throughout the world."

http://www.nationalpoetry.org

(San Francisco, CA- December 20, 2000) After ten years with the National =
Poetry Association, former President George Aguilar is embarking on a =
global poetry tour and bringing the NPA=92s critically-acclaimed =
collection of Cin(E)-Poems, videopoems and poetry films along with him. =
In addition to sharing the Cin(E)-Poetry archive with audiences around =
the world, Aguilaris soliciting collaboration with poets to join him in =
creating Cinematic (Electronic)-Poems or Cin(E)-Poems, a term he coined =
in 1996. As one of the foremost authorities on the genre, Aguilar is =
also available to conduct workshops, lectures, and participate on panels =
for educational institutions and arts organizations.

Mother Earth: Cin(E)-Poetry Tour 2001 will kick off in February in =
Vancouver B.C where Aguilar will be joined by International Slam Poetry =
Champion, Shane Koyczan. From February to June, Aguilar will be making =
his way across the U.S meeting poets, creating new works and streaming =
select webcasts of poetry readings, festivals via the Internet. The U.S. =
leg of the tour ends with a visit to Dr. Maya Angelou, a long time =
supporter of the NPA, in North Carolina. From the home of Dr. Angelou, =
Aguilar will journey to South America to attend The XI International =
Exhibition of Experimental Poetry Festival in Medell=EDn, Columbia =
happening June 2-10. From July to September, Aguilar will travel =
throughout Europe with stops in Spain, France, Germany, Italy and =
Greece. The tour ends in October, when Aguilar arrives at Mt. Everest to =
attempt a high-altitude wireless webcast.

Mother Earth: Cin(E)-Poetry Tour 2001 is made possible by the generous =
sponsorship of the National Poetry Association, Hellonetwork.com, and =
the support of the global poetry community. To learn more about how you =
or your organization can participate in the Cin(E)-Poetry tour by =
featuring the Cin(E)-Poetry Collection at your venue, creating new works =
with Aguilar, hosting a workshop or panel discussion, or webcasting, =
please contact Christine Harris, Tour Coordinator at =
Coordinator@nationalpoetry.org.

Mother Earth: Cin(E)-Poetry Tour 2001 Dates

  a.. February to early June: Canada, United States=20
  b.. June: South America (Columbia, Peru)=20
  c.. July to September: Europe (Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Greece)=20
  d.. October: Asia (Russia, India, Nepal, China)
To help defray the costs of this global tour, Aguilar is asking for room =
and board while working with poets to create a Cin(E)=96Poem of their =
work or conducting a workshop/panel discussion. For Aguilar=92s bio, =
visit http://www.George.Aguilar.com. If you are asking Aguilar to appear =
at your venue to conduct a workshop or serve on a panel, a nominal =
honoraria is also requested. All newly created Cin(E)-Poems are =
copywritten by George Aguilar with his permission to use the poems to =
help poets promote their work. Asked why he is undertaking this journey, =
Aguilar replied, "If it isn't overly ambitious and it doesn't have a =
99.9% chance of failing spectacularly then it just wouldn't be of any =
interest to me.###

For my money (& I know some of these titles have been mentioned before):

both _Ulysses_ & _Finnegan's Wake_ by Joyce

certain passages in _Moby Dick_ which, I think, are as gorgeous as
   Shakespeare, or certainly the "tragic" Shakespeare of King Lear

Anything by Kerouac, but (just to pick one particular title) those
   hefty "prose poem"-like descriptions in the first part of _Visions
   of Cody_

Also, parts of _Naked Lunch_

       (this comes down to a question of WHAT IS "poetic" prose...)

Certain stories of Poe's, e.g. "The Masque of the Red Death," when the
   prose gets (almost too) lush

_Tristram Shandy_, which is if nothing else a kind of forerunner to
   Ashbery

Kathy Acker's work generally, but (again just to pick one title) let's
   say particularly _Kathy Goes To Haiti_

Breton's _Nadja_, which I'm reading now, & which contains great lines
   like "Don't I love her?  When I am near her I am nearer things
   which are near her."

Does anybody know any novels by the Oulipeans?  I'm sure they should be
added to our list....

           Signing out now,

#  Well, although I tend to agree with your Darwinian commentary here, this

#  particular way and remembered as having been said in that way.  For
#  millennia poetry was a technology (using alliteration, caesura, parallelism)
#  that enabled something 'said particularly' to be remembered as such.  In the
#  early days, poetry enabled literature to exist. As language began to be
#  recorded, duplicated, and distributed, poetry found an enthusiastic public
#  and developed greater precision. Homer et al had their day in the sun.  Then
#  came Chaucer.  Then other technologies came along and made poetry less
#  necessary: the printing press, the postal system, then the networked
#  computer. As these technologies have increased in speed and efficiency, the
#  form of poetry (and all literary art) has degenerated.  Of course it had to:
#  it was no longer needed.  Poetry is being shed from literature like a
#  cocoon; is a butterfly emerging? Probably so, but why not wonder?  We who
#  paint the butterfly's wings must wonder.

I agree that the analogy is problematic and, probably, imprecise.

Changed, maybe. I'm not too sure about it being "shed from literature" or
"having greater precision" or "less neccessary". The technologies that have come
along have made poets focus on other things, if I may be so vague. There is
certainly wonder about what comes next for poets and poetry.

#  That said, any attempt to compare fiction and poetry to determine which is
#  'better' is admittedly ludicrous; my initial question was facetious, I had
#  thought, obviously; I don't think that one 'genre' is superior. Though I am
#  fretting about the present and future of literature, I think not without
#  good reason. The first round of non-hateful responses to it was exactly what
#  I was looking for-- Richard's hilarious bit about computer-authors,
#  Patrick's anecdote about the family dinner table, Mr. Bowering's
#  declaration.  So the question may stem from a false premise, but the answers
#  are not all meaningless, as Jacques and Marla have pointed out. So Patrick,
#  please maintain your 'narcotic optimism'-- and do not doubt anyone's 'gray
#  matter' -- As Bill put it, a 'fruitless but fun exercise' --

My response was, I thought, non-hateful. I was responding in part to the canard
about "budweiser" and wine - similar arguments have surfaced in the UK about
"dumbing-down". This thread was, I thought, beginning to wander into the shadow
of that argument. I, as must be obvious, think the opposite.

As I wrote, I don't know any more.

"Controversy" was too strong a word.

I do want to clarify that I have not received e-mails regarding FENCE

Steve Benson & Eric Selland

Steve Benson and family live on the northern coast of
Maine, where he usually works as a clinical
psychologist. This fall they spent in San Diego and
Steve taught a workshop at UCSD.  His  most recent
book is Roaring Spring (Zasterle, 1998) and before
that Reverse Order (Potes and Poets, 1990) and Blue
Book (The Figures/Roof, 1988).  When he gives poetry
readings often there is an interaction between
previously written texts and oral improvisation.

Eric Selland’s new book, The Condition of Music, is
just out on Sink Press. A book length work The
Transparencies is available on-line at Black Fire
White Fire.  His poetry and his translations from the

Canada, Japan, and France.  His translation of
Japanese modernist Yoshioka Minoru’s Kusudama was
published by Leech Books.  He has also contributed
articles an Japanese Modernist poetry to the Chicago
review and on translation theory to the Manoa Review.
Translations of Hiroya Takagai, Inagawa Masato,
Yoshioka Minoru, Hiraide Takashi and Nagata Koi are
on-line at Duration Press.  A collaboration initiated
by Selland  between 6 U.S. poets and 6 Japanese poets
will appear in lyric& #8.

Hope to see you there,
Avery E. D. Burns
Literary Director

Jackson  Mac Low is widely known for his experimental compositional methods.
His work makes various use of what he calls “deterministic procedures,”
often mixed with other writing modes to produce “liminal” works suggestive
of the threshold between the Unconscious and Consciousness.  This workshop
will offer participants the chance both to talk about such procedures—as
well as other ways of writing poems “otherwise”—and to try some out through
a variety of activities.

Workshop co-sponsored by The University of Arizona Extended University
Writing Works Center, The University of Arizona Poetry Center, The
University of Arizona English Department, and the journal Arizona Quarterly.

If you're planning to attend the Jan 28 workshop with Jackson Mac Low,
you're invited to send POG a brief sample of your writing which we'll pass
on to him soon.

you can definitely attend the workshop even if you don't submit work, but
Jackson indicates he'd find it useful to have samples from several of the
participants (everyone, by the way, "gets in" the workshop: the sample isn't
a screening device, but a way for Jackson to have a better idea of the
writers he's working with).

(the other side of the coin: you should only send work if you're reasonably
sure you'll attend the workshop).

you can send work via snailmail to:

POG
7931 East Presidio Road
Tucson, AZ  85750

or via email (slightly preferable).  If you send via email:
please send as an ATTACHED FILE if possible, since this will preserve your
formatting (if you can't do that, cut/paste is ok but such features as line
endings will tend to get messed up).

and if you email please send the email directly to Tenney Nathanson, and NOT
to the listserv address by hitting REPLY to this email.  So send to:

tenney@azstarnet.com

(if your email program is set up to read hotlinks, you can just click on
this one:
mailto:tenney@azstarnet.com
)

(but/and: those who are not writers, but have an interest in attending the
workshop, are definitely welcome!)

we're looking forward to receiving work from several Tucson writers--and to
Jackson's workshop and reading.


happy holidays,

Tenney

NOW IT'S UNOFFICIAL: GORE DID WIN FLORIDA
____________________________________________________________________

THE OBSERVER
International News
Sunday, 24 December 2000
http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,415367,00.html
Ed Vulliamy in New York

As George W. Bush handed further key government posts to hardline
Republican right-wingers, an unofficial recount of votes in Florida
appeared to confirm that Bush lost the US presidential election.

Despite the decision by the US Supreme Court to halt the Florida recount in
the contested counties, American media organisations, includ ing Knight
Ridder - owner of the Miami Herald - have commissioned their own counts,
gaining access to the ballots under Freedom of Information legislation. The
result so far, with the recounting of so-called 'undervotes' in only one
county completed by Friday night, indicates that Al Gore is ahead by 140
votes.

Florida's 25 electoral college votes won Bush the presidency by two seats
last Monday after the Supreme Court refused to allow the counting of 45,000
discarded votes. But as the media recount was suspended for Christmas, the
votes so far tallied in Lake and Broward counties have Gore ahead in the
race for the pivotal state, and hence the White House.

Gore's lead is expected to soar when counting resumes in the New Year and
Miami votes are counted. In a separate exercise, the Miami Herald
commissioned a team of political analysts and pollsters to make a
statistical calculation based on projections of votes by county, concluding
that Gore won the state by 23,000.

The media initiative is likely to bedevil Bush in the weeks to come,
thickening the pall of illegitimacy that will hang over his inauguration on
20 January.

It has already led to a face-off between almost all the news media
organisations in the state and Bush's presidential team. In the most
extreme example of the Bush camp's desperation to avoid a recount, the new
director of the Environment Protection Agency, Christine Todd Whitman, has
proposed that the Florida ballots be sealed for 10 years.

Bush's spokesman Tucker Eskew dismissed the recount as 'mischief-making'
and 'inflaming public passions' while his brother, Florida governor Jeb
Bush, accused the papers of 'trying to rewrite history'.

I've begun realizing that I am experiencing difficulty working on web pieces
be cause of the "absence" of the right tool in Clifford Burke's sense: 'good
tools that are used to make beautiful things have a mellowness that is
comfortable to live and work with' (_Printing Poetry_ SF, Scarab, 19080, p.
5).  he's referring here specifically to a press, but also by extension to
the rest of his comments, it would include, pencil, brush, calligraphic pen,
and ?typewriter?.

It might be that I'm just blocked, but I think that's why I find myself
returning to writing and scrawling.  I'm not sure any amount of  'flashy
ebooks' are going to fill in this absence and apparently I'm not alone.

"Controversy" was too strong a word.

Hi Aaron,

I saw your request, and this is what I found below and the full text can be
read (along with all the oldies ...) at
http://denmark.gq.nu/translations.htm

This is a quote from the site:
The following 40-verse poem, Hanuman Chaleesa, is a translation from
phonetic Sanskrit to Danish (and English) by Bent Lorentzen.  Copenhagen
(Christiana) poet and leader of a Tibetan volunteer group, Martin Thor
Nielsen, helped smoothen the final draft.  Tusind tak, Martin.

Arguably the oldest poem in the world, it is the telling of an ancient story
of the conflict between the archetypes of good and evil in the world, and of
love, and of service, and of redemption.  All those things to which any
surviving culture's spirituality is based.  the Ramayana (Song of God), of
which the Hamnuman Chaleesa is a crucial part, shows that it matters little
what caste one is born to, or what one's deeds were prior to spiritual
awakening, anyone can attain unity with God's perfection provided one is
willing to embrace his or her  deepest roots.  That, after all, is what most
world religions aspire to.



Best, Geoffrey

Hi Folks,

Since hardly anybody I know reads the SF Chronicle Sunday book review
section, I thought I'd announce that my review of Eileen Myles' new
"nonfiction novel" Cool for You will run January 7.  (Once a review
got bumped until the following week, but the ETA they give me is
usually accurate.)  It will also be available online at
www.sfgate.com.

Even if you don't read the review, read the book.  It's fantastic.

Dodie

Direct testimony -- poll worker tells of Palm Beach irregularities


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--

Dear friends,

I don't normally send emails like this to a large block of people, certainly
when it comes to my family, and certainly when the import of the issue makes
it seem like the letter might travel far and wide. But so many people have
asked about this story that it seems important to send it out. This is the
true story of my mother, precinct clerk in Palm Beach county, Florida.

My mother was a precinct clerk in Palm Beach county, Florida, election day of
2000. Mom's very good friend Leah was a precinct clerk as well. Both of them
were incredibly upset during and after election day, before anyone knew the
import of these specific voters. And my mother was convinced there were
serious irregularities long before they gained national prominence, and she
called me to say so.

I note this because some Republicans are now asking if there were these
irregularities, how come they were not raised until after the election? In
fact, my mother and the other precinct clerks raised these issues from the
moment that the polls opened in the morning; the problem is that the person
they intially called on was Theresa LePore, elections supervisor of Palm
Beach county. She was the source of the ballot confusion, and was
uninterested in the issue.

First, the paper ballot was extremely confusing to these voters. Although
both major parties got a chance to review the card layout, it is not clear if
any had a chance to put the actual ballot in an actual machine and punch the
holes. The card is laid horizontally as you vote, and it is hard to see the
holes as you punch them. And my mother, who supervised the precinct she was
in (this is a paid position, and she reported directly to Ms. LePore) said
the card did not even fit correctly in the ballot machine, so the holes in
the card did not line up with the ballot.

Anyone who thinks this was minor voter confusion has never dealt with
retirees in a West Palm Beach retirement village in Florida, I promise you.

My mother, following the rules, said the poll workers had been told not to
help people with the cards, as it might bias the voters. My mother witnessed
many, many people who voted incorrectly. Some stayed on a second line and had
their cards re-done, some punched the second hole (and thus were probably
thrown out), and some found out they voted for Buchanan after they had
deposited their cards in the ballot box, and there was thus nothing they
could do.

Mom called me up to complain about this after the elction, and she called me
up again on Thursday, very upset after reading a story in the New York Times
(Nov. 9 2000, p. B6). The Times story states:

After numerous complaints were received on Tuesday morning, Ms. LePore issued
this directive to the county's 106 precincts: Attention all poll workers.
Please remind all voters coming in that they are to vote only for one (1)
presidential candidate and that they are to punch the hole next to the arrow
next to the number next to the candidate they wish to vote for.

Mom never received this directive, and she believes that if anyone knew they
could have helped people vote their preference, the outcome would have been
very different. Instead, my mother and the others were trying to do the right
thing, and they felt that helping explain the ballot to these people would
have been helping them to vote for Gore, something she didn't feel was
proper. These women are honest to a fault.

Leah did receive the directive, but not until 4pm on election day, and only
by accident; someone was coming to visit from the main office and told her
about it. In the mean time, my mother and Leah (and most of the precinct
clerks) had been desperately trying to call the county office. They had been
given a phone number by Ms. LePore and told that the phone line would be
staffed throughout the day. They were told to call if there were any problems.

Mom tried to call starting at 7:30am, calling straight through when polls
closed, but she got a busy signal the entire time. But mom was at a polling
station with only a pay phone, so she had to deposit coins each time, and
with long lines waiting for her, she was becoming increasingly frustrated.

Leah was precinct chief at the retirement village where they live, and ran a
polling station at the clubhouse. Having a more modern facility, Leah tried
on the phone as well, and when she couldn't get through, she called the
operator to ask her why the phone was busy. Leah had the presence of mind to
get the operator's number (history is made by people like Leah) when the
operator told her the phone was off the hook, meaning nobody was on the line
the entire day. Evidently, the supervisor's office just didn't want to hear
the complaints.

Leah then faxed the supervisor's office with her concerns at noon and again
at 2pm. Nobody called Leah back until 5pm, when she heard from Ms. LePore,
with the following words "don't bother me."

So as this news starts to be spun and re-spun, let me tell you a few things I
am certain to be true: -I can't argue intent either way, but the supervisor's
office in Palm Beach county is at the very least unable to carry out an
election in which these people have their say.

-These people started trying to fix the problem from the moment polls opened,
and were fought along the way. This is not about crying about the election
once it is over.

It pains me to see the issue being politicized by both sides. Gore has no
place having his advisor Daley make statements that after a recount, Gore
will emerge victorious; and Bush has no place saying that he is the victor,
or setting up a transition team. In fact, the idea that Bush and his brother
were together on election night, with Jeb Bush promising to "deliver
Florida," draws a picture at least to me with the semblance of impropriety,
especially now that we have seen the results so askew. I hope everyone will
pay attention to the facts here, and let the people of South Florida have the
same opportunity to vote that the rest of us had.

You are free to send this to anyone you wish.

Webmaster's comments:  A lot of young Republicans are making vicious remarks
about "old, stupid, or retarded" voters in West Palm.  These seniors are
people who worked long and honorably all their lives and retired to Florida.
They may no longer be doing Calculus or piloting jet planes, but there is one
quality they Do have.  They've seen a Lot of elections and heard thousands of
politician's lies.

So maybe they actually know what the score Really is, unlike the young punks.
 And that is precisely why GW doesn't want their votes counted.

Hello those not in DC,

I was just reading a piece of scholarly or academic writing--
   the kind that is suppossed to succeed at the MLA---
  and I started feeling blue, excluded, etc....
     UNTIL, that is, I noticed this particular author
            used the words "visionary" and "sublime"
            simply as pejorative words---in a very shorthand, dismissive
way---
         This author seemed to think the words were SYNONYMS!
       At first I thought I could say, not in bitterness so much as
incredulity
             "oh fie on this author! fie on the literary establishment,
etc!"

but then i thought----well, what really is the difference between
     "visionary" and "sublime" ? and realized that part of the game, of
course,
       is coming up with your own definitions of these words.....
      I guess Kant's definition of sublime is the most cited?
       (oe perhaps that band that did "wrong way?")
     But as for visionary, there's many more it seems....
      (recently talking t Joshua beckman about why Gerald Stern referred
          to his book as "visionary?")

     Anyway, the point is, these words are not synonyms ("visionary," and
"sublime")--
     so how do YOU, dear reader, understand the difference between these
terms?
      (I'm looking forward to your answers, even if you are at the
MLA....)

        chris

I have succeeded at the MLA
        by finding a great ethiopian restaurant
                and padding my wife's expense account
I can see but that doesn't make me visionary
        I can be ridiculous which
                gives me no access to the sublime
though a wise man once said it would
        but that's not the first time
                I was lied to by my heavy metal album covers
And I am not in DC right now so I feel less blue, excluded, etc
        than I would otherwise unless I was looking at art
                rather than hanging around at Tweed Central
where I would be more likely to worry about precise definitions
        of key terms, though not necessarily "visionary"
                and "sublime"
Somewhere in Pierre Bordieu I am certain
        there is a passage that explains why these words express symptoms
                of mental illness to bureaucrats (a word I use neutrally to
explain
                        professorial employment conditions not universal states
                                of professorial mind)
But I sold Distinctions and Homo Academicus and two or three others
        which means I sold whatever authority I could invoke to help me here
                make my case with distinction to homo academici
about the difference between the "visionary" and "sublime" but
        I feel somewhat comfortable not asserting very forcefully
                the tentative proposal that one ask, after Wittgenstein
"what would a definition of the sublime look like? what would it do?"
        Same with "visionary" and in both cases I would note
                that each term means something different to poets and
certain critics
than it does to critics unsympathetic with poetry and nervous
        about the nature of language, esp. its habit of changing, shifting,
fracturing
                any definition enshrined in learned journals
and cocktail party chatter remembered from MLAs long ago
        Not a breakthrough, chris, perhaps not even so much
                as a false start.

Ammiel Alcalay
Responses and Responsibilities--a talk=20

=85 at the intersection of politics and autobiography, the public and the
private, I will explore the ways a writer can respond-as a journalist,
translator, editor, literary and political activist, poet and conveyor of
local knowledges =85

Ammiel Alcalay is a poet, translator, critic and scholar. He is the author
of After Jews and Arabs: Remaking Levantine Culture (University of Minnesota
Press 1993), The Cairo Notebooks (Singing Horse Press 1993), and Memories of
Our Future (City Lights 1999). During the war in former Yugoslavia he was a
primary source for providing access in the American media to Bosnian voices.
He edited and co-translated Zlatko Dizdarevic's Sarajevo: A War Journal
(Henry Holt 1994) and Portraits of Sarajevo (Fromm 1995). He was responsible
for publication of the first survivor's account in English from a victim
held in a Serb concentration camp, The Tenth Circle of Hell by Rezak
Hukanovic (Basic Books 1996), which he co-translated and edited. He edited
and co-translated a major new anthology of contemporary Middle Eastern
Jewish writing, Keys to the Garden: New Israeli Writing (City Lights 1996),
the first collection of its kind in any language. He has also translated two
books by the Cuban poet Jose Kozer, Projimos / Intimates (Carrer Ausias
1990), and The Ark Upon the Number (Cross-Cultural Press 1982). Sarajevo
Blues, Alcalay's translation of the Bosnian poet Semezdin Mehmedinovic, came
out from City Lights in 1998. His current work-in-progress includes the book
From the Warring Factions, portions of which appear in Snare 2 (2000) and
jibilat 2 (winter 2000).

"Ammiel Alcalay brings to any subject an acute sensitivity to writing and a
sophisticated understanding of the way politics works to produce and
maintain literature. He is a unique and important figure in contemporary
world literature." - Lynne Tillman

"Few contemporary intellectuals can boast of as diverse a range of skills as
Ammiel Alcalay. His work is cosmopolitan in the best sense: in an epoch of
superficial globalism his approach to the cultures he deals with is always
rigorous, always meticulously respectful of particularities and differences.
There is no one better qualified to explore the meaning of today's 'culture
wars,' locally and globally." - Amitav Ghosh

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear Poetics List,
     I've just completed Markson's novel
Wittgenstein's Mistress, which someone on this list
mentioned. It really is quite good. If perhaps having
a few slow parts here and there (and I like art
history).
     Is it simply my perception or does any novel that
gives any attention to at all language theory or
philosophy get the appellation "experimental"?
     I wonder if that is justified.
     Maybe so.
     Has anyone read Markson's earlier novels? Are
they worth searching out as well?
     He mentions Gaddis a number of times, a novel
called The Recognitions. Any views on whether this too
would fit into the fiction that is also poetry
catalog?

Sincerely,
M

New Year's Day at the Poetry Project:

MONDAY, JANUARY 1, 2001 from 2 pm until past midnight
THE 27TH ANNUAL NEW YEAR=B9S DAY MARATHON READING
Welcome the new year with over 120 poets, musicians, dancers, and artists
performing and reading new works. The best, most exciting, most innovative
poets, writers, performance artists, spoken-word artists, slam poets,
musicians, dancers, visual artists, and downtown personalities ring in the
new year in their own inimitable styles: by continuing to push the
boundaries of the expected in explosions of words, music, sound, light, and
movement.=20

New York Magazine writes, "The Annual New Year=B9s Marathon readings,
featuring whoever=B9s around, from William Burroughs and Laurie Anderson to
Nick Zedd and Paul Beatty, have become required downtown viewing." The Dail=
y
News calls the Poetry Project event "New York=B9s Other Marathon...not for th=
e
artistic faint of heart [but] for seekers of something wildly,
jaw-droppingly different." The Village Voice describes the event as
"...short attention span theater on a marathon loop, with a flotilla of
deviant craft kicking out quick, hot flashes of dissidence in the age of
prigs and punishers."

The poets and performers 2001 include: Patti Smith, John Cale, Jim Carroll,
Eric Bogosian, Penny Arcade, Lenny Kaye, Douglas Dunn, John Giorno, Dael
Orlandersmith, Elliott Sharp, Nick Zedd, Peter Straub, Eileen Myles, Taylor

Chris,

It seems to me "sublime" refers to the appetite for
mute awe engendered by the grandeur and magnitude of
natural phenomena experienced in solitude (e.g.,
national parks: better--or at least more--than
expected, but still just an extension of the
familiar), whereas "visionary" specifies encounter
with a realm different than expected: not just a
scaling up of the natural (Mandelbrot set fractals),
but access to the full spectrum at once (as Pound
said of the Cantos, a single image), accompanied,
crucially, by a guide: Virgil for Dante, Blake for
Milton, Spicer's Martians.

I see Kent, for one, has riffed more eruditely on
this on subsub, but I'll Ockham it for now. Thanks
for bringing up the question.

Best,

Dan

Daniel -

I traveled to Canyonlands a few days ago.  It is, of course, a national
park, but also a "scaling up of the natural."  Its Monument Basin appears to
be one of the most wondrously large and complex basins of attraction (an
important feature of fractal patterns) etched in stone.  This sublime place
came back into my life with a guide of sorts this time.  Actually I was
attended by the quiet of a guide that died the day the last time I visited
the park over four years ago.  I guess my experience of Canyonlands just
this past Saturday, by your definition, was sublime and visionary.  I can
assure you it was overwhelming to return after such a murky personal
connection to the place.

I conclude that the experience of at least one national park can be
visionary, unlike what has been suggested by you, Daniel.  If you've never
seen Canyonlands, go there if you can.  I may never see another place as
beautiful.

Excellent post Daniel.  I think you are definitely on to something here.  I
just had to get my two cents in and keep a certain beautiful park from being
cast from the world of immersive visions, a place it most certainly belongs.

Chris,

It seems to me "sublime" refers to the appetite for
mute awe engendered by the grandeur and magnitude of
natural phenomena experienced in solitude (e.g.,
national parks: better--or at least more--than
expected, but still just an extension of the
familiar), whereas "visionary" specifies encounter
with a realm different than expected: not just a
scaling up of the natural (Mandelbrot set fractals),
but access to the full spectrum at once (as Pound
said of the Cantos, a single image), accompanied,
crucially, by a guide: Virgil for Dante, Blake for
Milton, Spicer's Martians.

I see Kent, for one, has riffed more eruditely on
this on subsub, but I'll Ockham it for now. Thanks
for bringing up the question.

Best,

Dan

Rod Smith reading
Sunday Jan 07 2pm
Kootenay School of Writing
201 - 505 Hamilton Street
604-688-6001
$5/$3


Rod Smith is the Washington DC poet. His books include In Memory of My
Theories (O Books, 96) Protective Immediacy (Roof, 99) & New Mannerist
Tricycle (with Lisa Jarnot and Bill Luoma, Beautiful Swimmer, 2000). He is
publisher of Edge Books, edits the journal Aerial, and co-ordinates a
reading series at Bridge Street Books in DC.

Art is no consolation, but it is art. Rod Smith sends us this "thinking
event of the pulse fetish tone handle" from America's capital, where each
day blank, pig-eyed men, hissing a kind of English, work toward the further
redistribution of wealth from the children of the underclasses to the
orbiting robots of capital. Tinned and untinned, Smith's art speaks in
resistance to treachery, and on behalf of several supressed tendencies and
human possibilities, some new, some older than agriculture. "A fringe
limitation/structures history," but "no analysand can indent this largesse."
-Kevin Davies

Smith is the dashing innovator of several important poetic movements
including Submodernism, Turtlism, New Mannerism, and Feeled Poetry. In his
writing a roving loving perceiving in contingency tells us "The surface, if
it's found/ is a symbol" and "what we haven't constructed/ in space is
praised by kissing" and "His genius at least includes ceilings." Therefore
he is also an architect.

smithnotes:

submodern: "with so much non-normative history piling up -- modernism,
postmodernism-- how explain its apparent lack of impact on discoursive
frameworks of power?"

turtlism: "The transformation of conflict into musical event gives ground to
the activity of the impractical material telepathy."

feeled poems: "in 2000 a field poem becomes something else"

neo mannerism: the school of forms.

Aaron.  So!  Now, as to the oldest recorded poem. Its not the Muhabburatta
in Sanscrit? Or is it:

    That poem that is everlastingly rewritten inside every poem.

    The alert and beautiful eyes of a child.

    The magic of my beans growing two inches in three days.

    A suffering, but gentle old person.

     Death love hate terror joy.

     My cat, whose "motor starts" when it lies on my stomach and seems to
know its alive.

    A laugh.        A cry.   Someone laughing, someone crying.

   Our Struggle. (Not His Struggle)

   Thought.

   The sound of rain on any surface.

"Nah. Naff off mate, we want the real answer!" All the best, Richard.

        in chemistry, "to sublime" means to cook off dross
                        leaving only the single element

        (so that's what all those junkies doing cooking up
                        in spoons--subliming!)

Their Bark Had No Tree:

If the group reading of 22 poets staged at the Four Seasons Hotel last
night is endemic of American poetry today, then American poetry is dead.
Barrett Watten read a long poem On Friendship clearly designed to be
flagged by the Oxford Book of Poems on Friendship and torpid enough to
make it in. My apologies to the Metaphysicals. Watten's meditation was
obviously a product of too many idle moments in his lit department
office.

Bob Perelman did him one snoozier with an interminable, 5 minute piece
punctuated by reports of his frequent flyer miles. With a lot of these
folks, rebellion seems to have gone the way of their hair, if one can
believe they ever had any fire in them to begin with.

Johanna Drucker read her "hygenic hardware" poem in a spectaular
monotone that resembled HAL the computer in 2001. The poem beats to
death a single metaphor and then compounds the felony by having a book
designed around it.

Juliana Spahr read two poems that rather mechanically and
unimaginatively morphed one word into another in bland and fatuous
association. Then she grafted an appendix to each poem that by fiat
insisted upon the above exercises grave consequences. Very sterile.

It was clear that Jerome Rothenberg's contribution to poetry does not
come from his own work. And one learns that Loss Glazier and Susan Howe
are nervous, frail creatures that one should not stand up and hoot at at
poetry readings, no matter how bereft there presentation is of substance
or talent. Somewhat the same can be said of the Waldrop's who seem to at
least to muster a little intensity for their work even if its not
actually in the work.

There's no Sturm und Drang in young Faust, Graham Foust that is.
Likewise for the others who if they knew anything at all were powerless
to communicate it in their poetry.

With all the enthusiasm that Pope John now musters for the Confiteor,
moderator Rod Smith of Bridge Street and Ariel Magazine kept waking up
the audience with his own monotone recital of "what a great reading this
is." But a "great" reading it was not. And from audience reaction, it
seems certain that if you caught any of them in an honest, Guinness
soaked moment they would have communicated their shock at the amateurish
nature of the proceedings especially in light of the "all-star" cast.
But in the back of the audience's minds rests two concerns; do I write
any better? And do I want to offend any of these guys when I might need
a job reference? This was the tone that informed the evenings poetry.
This is what people mean when they refer to "academic" poetry.

The readers went in reverse alphabetical order, so that the grand poobah
and frightfully insipid poet, Charles Bernstein could read last. When
Charles made his way to the podium, most of the FlashPoint staff made
its way to the exits. This was in no way intended as a protest of
Bernstein's cruel censorship of the eloquent Henry Gould, the sheepish
Gabe Gudding and, now, the endearing and totally innocent, Kent Johnson.
We just couldn't stand even 5 more minutes of the poetic drivel. Carlo

So, every library can't stock everything. Harry Potter is not available
everywhere--nor should it be. The opinionated stockers are the ones
falling to infamy. Y'all just can't carry everything, can you? Are you
censors or are you simply responding to the space and budget at hand?

Forget about the misleading Potter/Twain/Cleaver examples of
"censorship"--let's focus on the real thing: The missing semicolon!!!!

It goes like this--or WENT like this at one enlightened time: "This film
has been modified from its original version; it has been formatted to
fit your screen." THEN what happened? Now the semicolon has been
excommunicated and the slogan reads: "This film has been modified from
its original version. It has been formatted to fit your screen."

Americans can't handle semicolons? !Is this true?! Oh! The humanity! If
we can't employ a semicolon, how can we....

Where is my semicolon!

How right you are!  None of my "college students" knows what to do with the
semi-colon.  They are lost; they wander a new dark age.  Best, Bill

I was reading the other day that the Vedas were purposefully handed
down only orally for a long time after writing had appeared in their
local culture, and that as what we ordinarily understand by meaning
became lost this was justified on the grounds that the syllable (=
sound) was what mattered, since sound and true meaning were conflated.

Is deliberate oral transmission considered a sort of record?

Is what I read true?

I believe George Orwell, in "Politics and he English Language," questions
the efficacy of the semi-colon. In his essay on Orwell's essay,
Canadianwriter Brian Fawcett repeats this bit of practical advice, writing,
"never use a semi-colon. I know I'm repeating Orwell, but this is so
important it bears repeating. Semi-colons are absolutely reliable signals
that a sentence should be rewritten, generally to make it more direct. And
incidently, you should only use a colon if you're wearing a tuxedo or
sitting on white porcelain."  Brian Fawcett. _Unusual Circumstances,
Interesting Times_. Vancouver: New Star, 1991, page 134.
        And, yes, I did in fact put on a tux to type the bibliographic info.

hi all,
is there any chance that someone could report on this discussion? This is
an area of particular interest to me - the manifesto that is.

Thanks and the best of the season to all,
kevin hehir

To List,

I'm not really following this thread very closely as I'm trying to take a
break from all things electronic (except remote controlled car I found
under my tree) for the holidays. But, I gather that there is talk of
fiction as poetry.

I'll toss in
:  Ondaatje, Michael, In the skin of a lion : a novel. New York, N.Y. : Penguin Books,
1988,

absolutely beautiful. i'm not about to enter the current debate and try to
defend my selection. just pick it up and read any page. also very salient
for anyone intersted in labour, class and the development of the city in
north america.

all the bests,
kevin

I have read all his books except his book on Lowry (of which I have
read part), and I am a big fan. I believe that Going Down can be
called a great American novel if it makes sense to talk about such a
thing. Three early books are "entertainments," two of them terrific
hardnose detective books, but really, Markson does not allow these to
be reprinted, i think. The bad thing about being a Markson fan is
that he lets years go by without publishing a book; you might also
want to check out the Markson issue of The review of Contemporary
Fiction.

CALL FOR DOCTORS (both short term and long)

Is there a doctor in the house?
Is there a doctor on the list, a physical doctor, an M.D.?
Or does anybody on this list have a friend who is a physical doctor, an
M.D?
If so, could you contact me, please, as soon as possible
(it would especially help if you're in the new york area)
because I would like to offer a trade---
say a poem for an x-ray?

Please contact Chris Stroffolino 718-782-2594.....

In more general news, to poets:
WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS MEDICAL CRISIS
(not just my specific one right now)
But how many of YOU HERE ALSO DO NOT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE?
How many of you here are also so fed up with the way
that a PH.D. is not of course considered a real DOCTOR?
or the one who may heal physically be considered better
than the one who may inspire (and maybe even heal) mentally?
(though of course some of you reject the thereapeutic model of poetry--
probably because you already have health care or inheritance or
something)...
I mean shouldn't we try to CHANGE THIS---
can we join together communally to do this,or at least try?
Please contact me, anybody who might be intersted in arranging
some way in which poets may give their services in exchange to doctors
for theirs--
in this age of privitaization, especially now that bushy poo is
"elected"
or my friend Noelle wins an NEA grant (which is good---though the
government
may not let her have her money because of debts in student loans)--
we gotta find some way of solidarity on this---
obviously i am not the only one?
