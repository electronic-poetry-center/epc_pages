        Attention friends and their friends:

Through the month of August, a full set of the first four issues of Kenning

comes in the format normally exculsive to subscribers:  loose-leaf in a
hand-printed portfolio.  NOTE:  This is the only way to acquire these

have a look at the Kenning website for further information.  You may also

"There are no compassionate, harmless ways to remake oneself.
We murder ourselves so we can rebirth ourselves in our dreams."

Vietnamese woman living in Shepherd's Bush, London.
Quoted by Judith Barry.


Who Are These Coming to the Sacrifice?
The print has gone back, then. Many were missing at the theater.
Would they have seen what I saw?  We see what they say,
or we say they can't see.  After the second showing,
I went away, like Alma, the Indian Princess, empty inside.
It's the spectacle of her immolation, when I had thought
the closure of the film would balance out in the exchange
in passing to the Patrona outside the house where she,
Alma, as complex a sign for the category of Woman
as one might hope to find, has just given to Sacramento,
the High Priest of his mother's solitary sect, the experience
of his sex. He cuts his wrists. There is adoration in those eyes
whose owner is about to extinguish them of their light.
Which is the greater sin under the sign system, the church
no one here appears to be able to labor their way out of:
incest or suicide? But is the movie, then, about Religion?
The patchwork canvas rags that comprise the Big Top
of the Circo Fantasia and the no less haphazard colors
of the Theater Truck. The relation of Religion to Art.

Catalogue note:  "In 1529, Giovanni Battist della Palla
once more paid for Andrea to paint. This time the artist,
anxious to recover his former patron's favor, exerted himself
to the utmost, and produced his Sacrifice of Abraham, a picture
far finer in expression than any other work of his later years.
But the siege intervened . . ."  You can hardly think of Alma,
or her father, Renato the Clown, or the Patrona and her son,
as characters at all in a fiction more or less awkwardly called
"social-realist." The child, Noah, exists as some kind of rope
or umbilical cord that keeps pulling Alma back to her childhood
in his jester's outfit he wears to call the people to the theater
and the Book of Forgiveness on which their names may be signed.
The Redemptress (as she's called by the street kids straight out
of that early film of Bunuel's) drives through the Barrios
like an inveterate survivor of the ages, the Mystery Play.
Angel del Fuego is about the martyrdom of Fictive Being.
There is no hope, and the dead do not rise from their graves.
In Dana Totenberg's second film, historical materialism
arrives on the wing of Mortification and Miscarriage.


\ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ /


Note:  Totenberg or Rotenberg?  Does anyone know if she's made any more
films?  The Judith Barry quote I associate with an exhibition at the
Cleveland Art Museum when I first moved to Cleveland in the fall of
1996, where there was a multi-media installation of hers in a show that
included an installation by Kevin Evans, whose Whitney shipping crate
continues to grace the cooking area of my loft; Evans' installation was
prison-guard uniforms on clotheslines, something to do with the prison
industry and black working-class neighborhoods.  The Cleveland Art
Museum was one of five U.S. museums to host the recent Diego Rivera
exhibit, "Art and Revolution."  Andrea del Sarto's "Sacrifice" is part
of the its permanent collection.

George Bowering is right. It was the 1970s that the Italians were said to be
burning mail.  It was 1976 when I heard of it.  Really, that's not so long
ago. I am relieved to know that it was more than a rumour.  It was on TV &
must be true.  Burning poetry is less likely to make it to the TV news,
unless it's being done by a cute animal -- even if the police do suspect
arson.

This review got my goat when I first read it a month or so ago on Jacket.
It is ambivalent, prodding, & terribly uninspired. How was this review
(which appears to be the same one from the Chronicle)put together? Every
complement is countered by a neutral or negative bit of language.  Weighted
down by "the patient reader," "certain obsessive themes," "finicky,"
"generalizing," "odd," and so forth, this review appears to be trying to
pass off as a positive one while seeding itself with vague & underlying
resentment. Clark describes Whalen's writing as "disarmingly self-deflating
comedy" without giving any sort of an enthused explanation as to why this
very truth can bring about some of the best comic writing around.  In the
end, one gets the feeling that Tom Clark just dashed this one off to the
presses.  If he disliked the book then so be it.  Say so.  If he really felt
that this "self-deprecating hipster-bodhissatva, wine glass and joint at the
ready...remains perhaps the finest comic creation of the Beat era." then he
sure made a lousy, shlocky stab at doing so.  This selection was, in my
opinion, one of the very best pieces of literature I came across this year.
Whalen's writing deserves a better review than the limp & inchoate one that
the Chronicle served up. I mean, count the words with typically negative
connotations, and then read the review again.  Inititally, I thought it was
a positive review.  Feeling somehow uneasy, I read it again.  I don't think
I would have picked the book up if I had simply read this review at face
value without having already known of Whalen's writing and of this book
specifically.  For some, this will be a true shame.

Subject:      Experimental Poetry & History (call for papers)
Content-Type: text/plain

             Experimental American Poetry: Reforming History

              NEMLA Convention, 7-8 April 2000, Buffalo, NY
                     Abstracts due by 15 September

    How does innovative technique make possible innovative history?  How does
experiment help uncover the mechanisms of concealment and revelation in
language and historical narrative?
    This panel will bring together investigations of the ways in which formal
experimentation (particularly, though not limited to, the experimentation
associated with Language Poetry) confronts history and the generic markers of
historical narrative.  Formal innovation often calls attention to the
mechanisms of language, to the ways language both conceals and reveals, coerces
and invokes; such attentiveness to the shapes and functions of language
likewise revises the operations, structures, and boundaries of history. We seek
papers that consider the consequences of, as well as the motives for,
confrontations between experimental writing and history. How, for example, do
the paradigm shifts demanded by these writings revise governing notions of
tradition, of lineage, of what is "private," "personal," or "public"?
    Given that the convention is to take place in Buffalo, we are particularly
insterested in papers that address the work of SUNY-Buffalo writers, such as
Susan Howe and Charles Bernstein.  However, papers on other authors will be
equally welcome.


Questions concerning this panel may be addressed via email to panel co-chairs
    Deborah Mix <mix@pilot.msu.edu> and/or
    Elizabeth Savage <easavage@saturn.vcu.edu>.
We prefer to receive abstracts by regular mail or fax; copies of
proposals should be submitted to both of us no later than 15 September.

For immediate release:

Riding the Meridian -- Nationality or Not
http://www.heelstone.com/meridian

Guest edited by Peter Howard

As words zip 'round the world on newsgroups, bulletin boards and mailing
lists, all of us find certain people with whom we feel an enhanced form
of kinship.  Their ability to express themselves in writing, the nuances
of their 'virtual' personalities, their sense of humor (or humour,
depending on what form of English you're typing in), stylistic tastes,
all add to and amplify one's own sense of enjoyment in being a writer in
the late twentieth century.  The person you're communicating with may be
from another country as easily as they can be from down the street.

For me, one of these people is the very talented and well-spoken poet,
panellist, and columnist, Peter Howard, who lives in Cambridge, England.

As guest editor for Riding the Meridian, Howard has assembled an
international group of writers to help shed light on the impact the
Internet is having on communication and national/regional writing and
identity.  From Andre Mangeot's take on how easily the English language
can subvert the spelling of his name, to Clinton V du Plessis's striking
imagery about the conflict in South Africa, to Red Slider's tribute to
Sam Grolmes on the occasion of receiving his translations of Ryuichi
Tamura--where the character of the written language itself informs the
meat of the poem, to Michael Rothenberg's imagined cyberchat between a
group of French speakers and a would-be American tourist, Howard's
choice of writers shows--here with pathos, there with wit--the
incredible diversity at work within the Internet literary community.
And to quote him: "Oooh, but I'm assuming everyone speaks some variety
of English, aren't I? Naughty of me. The difference it makes to those
who don't (in a pseudo-space where most do) is an interesting question
in itself."  Expect some enlightenment on that, as well as a short tour
of Flash Fiction by Viktor Car, Alex Keegan, and Sheila Murphy, and many
other surprises, as well.

It's been an honor to work with Peter on this issue; if anyone was
metaphorically best suited to fully inaugurate Riding the Meridian, it
was he.

N. J. Loftis's early 70s book BLACK ANIMA had long been thought unavailable
-- but there must have been a box or two of them lingering in a warehouse,
because it's now gettable through amazon.com -- This is an unusual book,
with words of praise from both Auden & Ashbery -- the amazon listing tells
you it's a paperback, but when the book arrives in your mail you'll find
it's the original hardcover -- at only $7.95 it's well worth your trouble
-- get 'em while they last!

An article I want to write describes bungling as a primary condition of
human existence, the confusion that results from a tendency towards tele-
ology on one hand, and the complexity of everyday life on the other. Con-
spiracy theory depends upon transcendence, a world of cause and effect;
bungling theory is based on literal chaos, marked trajectories in colli-
sion. History, obviously after the fact, tends towards conspiracy, if only
through the filtering of the past, and the ideology of that filtering;
making sense of the world is making a world out of sense, that sense con-
structed from senselessness. It is senseless all the way down; there are
no armatures, articulations, that extend beyond immediate domains, and
even universal physical laws apply with such a light force - even death as
such - that the wobbling of the world is always in evidence for those who
see with open eyes. (We fail to see, as if by accident, this is the arti-
cle that I have wanted to write, that sight itself resides at the tail-end
of the whip, the perceptual cleansing of an abjecting world.)

Bungling shapes the destiny of the human; it is a history always already
not yet written, unwritable; it is in fact the nature of states-of-affairs
in the Wittgensteinian and ordinary senses. Nothing proceeds according to
plan because planning is always foreclosed, the result of a game occurring
in a potential well permanently at odds with the rest of the universe, an
impossibility. Heuristics come into play at every localized turn of ev-
ents; the turn is of the nature of the bungle. Throughout, there are impe-
tuses (let us say), trajectories/tendencies which proceed freely for a
while, before hitting a wall or other dispersion. (We fail to see that
obstacles are never placed, but of the order of the real.)

Likewise motives remain deeply and permanently unclear; the ascription of
motive is again an ascription of history, the imputation of meaning. To
accept the deep meaninglessness of the world - including the bungling
within and without the genome - is to begin an understanding which goes
nowhere, because there is nowhere to go. Meaning is a temporary hiatus,
the strategy of substance and presence, just as the sememe presents once
again localized constructs allowing the human to co-exist with its ab-
sence. And beyond or before motives, there is truth itself, already shaken
within the foundations of symbolic logic, but accepted, with considerable
fanfare and maintenance, on the level of the life-world. Once again, iss-
ues of foreclosure and bungling appear, since truth is confined to that
very same potential well - it's as if nothing can get at truth, because
truth can get at nothing. (We fail to see that nothing is just that, not a
project nor a noun.)

For within the well, there is nothing at all, that is nothing ontological-
ly viable - the well parallels the projections of the Platonic cave, a
form of cinematic diminishment allowing meaning to emerge. The cinema is
the model for the construction of meaning, the jump-cut for example as a
concatenation on the level of ideality, the linkages or couplings of
thought. But such a construction can only be a projection or introjection
- one immediately runs into a subjectivity undercutting the crystalline
world of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, which can still be taken as
the analog of orderly non-bungling, no matter how the Sheffer stroke is
tossed about within it. We are still inheritors of the 19th-century, and
conspiracy theory dies hard. (We fail to see that the success of a plan is
an after-effect.)

Which is not to say, by the way, that conspiracies do not exist or are not
successful - but to say that they are not the order of the world, that
assassinations are assassinations, that annihilations have no reason what-
soever, no matter the cause. Or rather that the cause occurs within that
potential well, that the ontological significance is nil, that acts of
violence and non-violence, acts of criminality and acts of freedom and
compassion, on a certain uncanny level, are idiotic in Clement Rosset's
sense - that is, occurring within an inert and bungled world, and now, an
overcrowded world deeply at odds with itself - and characterized by such
odds. (We fail to see the foolishness around us.)

For this reason, it is reasonable to say, we are not making a mess out of
things, but, existentially in fact, we are making things out of a mess, as
if these things had prior commitments. And that such makes us happy and
gives us a life to live, not even in-the-face-of anything or tendency at
all, but within the structural need of the human to by and large persev-
ere, reproduce. Every defeat of the conspiratorial is a defeat for all of
us; every cause that appears set free in the middle of the night attempts
the creation of a new language of transcendental meaning. On one hand, the
ruthlessness of non-truth; on the other, the truth of ruthlessness. We
live by the latter, the former breathing down our necks - like death, al-
ways on the periphery of our project. The subject, us, is always under
construction, and thereby lies the lie. (We fail to see there are lies
without truths.)


Plan-et Ground


There are lies without truths; the probability of truth is zero as an in-
finite number of alternatives to exactitude appear to gnaw at the founda-
tions. Everyone from Max Black (and I assume earlier) has noticed this.
I'm not saying anything new. It might not have been Max Black; it could
have been anyone. Further, there are no foundations, not if they're so
thin that they attempt to disappear at the slightest breath of the butter-
fly phenomenon. They don't attempt to disappear; there's disappearance
everywhere at work here in the Cosmos. One false step in a program, and...
Try writing HTML and put an extra < or > somewhere in the middle of a 20k
page and see what emerges! Write a program and leave out the ; at the end
of the line. You're beginning to get the picture - and it's lucky the pic-
ture appears at all, given the compressions, translations, protocols,
transmissions necessary for Nikuko's appearance in Cyberspace, New York.
That's the Aristotelian rag, the classical logics that seem stable on the
level of the real, keeping the values conserved and down. There's an econ-
omy at work here. The breakdown-urge is greater than the holdfast. The
Cosmos are full of part-objects, splatter-phenomena, dispersions without
history, worn curb edges that nothing went past. To put a plan together is
to foresee all possible consequences, defend against them. Any one of six
billion people on the planet might conceivably show up at any moment,
unwanted dinner guests, parasites in Serres' sense of the term. Plans are
always already T-junctions, the thick stem replete with noise, temporary
convolutions, circuit drains. Place the wrong ground in a circuit and
electrons confuse everything, nothing travels much farther, all the images
disappear; they were present for your eyes only, otherwise fallen apart. A
recent rabbinical ruling specifies the name of God online isn't quite a
name; the letters are pixels and independent, nothing stated or erased.
You might think otherwise; you're permitted to think whatever you want,
Speer tracing his footsteps over and over again, walking the plan-et earth
on the prison grounds. There were no grounds; there were firewalls, there
was no escape. The prison grounds grounded plan-et earth; countries sank
into walled corridors and corners. You and I will look up into the same
sky at the same time, our gaze will sustain us across these oceans. Water
has memory; memory has no shape; shape is a gift to water. The T is the
long-sought solution.

I agree with Coletti's interp of Tom Clark's ambivalent review. In the
context of the large public circulation of San Francisco Chronicle, and the
fact that Whalen is at the near end of his life, certainly his career, I was
disappointed that Tom Clark focused on Whalen's slight and minor aspects, and
somehow failed to look at the larger picture of Whalen's significance and
mostly unacknowledged contribution to particularly American writing. (You
would never know from the article that in 1969 Ron Padgett and Ted
Berrigan(?) led a demonstration of a huge contingent of writers and readers
around the offices of Harcourt & Brace when On Bears Head (the first
anthology) to protest the inaccessible $17.50 hard cover price.
In my opinion Whalen has produced some major stuff with large public
intention (and no small knowledge of his relation and dialogue with his
contemporaries and forbears). Among many works, as an entity, Scenes of Life
at the Capital is probably my favorite, and (I believe) represents a real
forward move from the Williams, Olson projects of poets who wander in City
and spaces beyond. (In Whalen's case, Kyoto was the city.)
My question remains as whether or not anybody has come to interesting and
critical grips with Whalen's work?? By the way I must confess that I have not
looked at the Penguin anthology. (I am more at home, where possible, with
individual books. I always felt, for example, that the Black Sparrow Spicer
anthology was a put off, or somehow diluted the unique power(magic) I got
from reading the series of his individual White Rabbit and other press title
books). On Bears Head, in fact, takes some fishing and sorting to take in the
stronger spaces on the graph. (Clark is right to pick up on periods of
disassociation and melancholia).  But, from what I gather in response of my
take on Clark's article, the Penguin anthology has created a mixed response,
even among longtime Whalen readers. Good editors - assuming that the editing
is the problem - at major publishing houses these days is not even a
conceptual oxymoron in that the position of Editor, particularly that of a
decently funded and supported Developmental Editor, appears to have gone the
way of digital flesh.
It might be of interest to the list for others to indicate Whalen work(s)
that hit the "A" bell. As it has (for me) been to hear people speak of works
by Ronald Johnson and Bob Grenier.

Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

It is ambivalent, prodding, & terribly uninspired. How was this review
(which appears to be the same one from the Chronicle)put together? Every
complement is countered by a neutral or negative bit of language.  Weighted
down by "the patient reader," "certain obsessive themes," "finicky,"
"generalizing," "odd," and so forth, this review appears to be trying to
pass off as a positive one while seeding itself with vague & underlying
resentment. Clark describes Whalen's writing as "disarmingly self-deflating
comedy" without giving any sort of an enthused explanation as to why this
very truth can bring about some of the best comic writing around.  In the
end, one gets the feeling that Tom Clark just dashed this one off to the
presses.  If he disliked the book then so be it.  Say so.  If he really felt
that this "self-deprecating hipster-bodhissatva, wine glass and joint at the
ready...remains perhaps the finest comic creation of the Beat era." then he
sure made a lousy, shlocky stab at doing so.  This selection was, in my
opinion, one of the very best pieces of literature I came across this year.
Whalen's writing deserves a better review than the limp & inchoate one that
the Chronicle served up. I mean, count the words with typically negative
connotations, and then read the review again.  Inititally, I thought it was
a positive review.  Feeling somehow uneasy, I read it again.  I don't think
I would have picked the book up if I had simply read this review at face
value without having already known of Whalen's writing and of this book
specifically.  For some, this will be a true shame.

If "Whalen's writing deserves a better review than the limp & inchoate one
that the Chronicle served up," write it. I don't think the SF chron poetry
reviews are making or breaking any reputations. It's encouraging, however,
to see that a review of poetry can still generate passionate responses.
Maybe Philip will get the critical attention he deserves.

Well, then there's (on the other side?) the question of "positive" reviews.
In the latest st. marks newsletter, for instance, there's at least two
"positive" reviews of books that--if i didn't already know the books (one
which i think is pretty damn great the other not bad but "excellent
scribbling in a period style"---more on this backchannel)--would actually
turn me away from reading them, more than a more AMBIVALENT review would.
Since I'm more interested in the ISSUE than in the specifics, I leave the
names blank for now....
curious what others think....

With the flurry of talk about Phil Whalen, I wanted to mention again
that _Beneath a Single Moon: Buddhism in Contemporary
American Poetry_, is being reissued by Shambhala shortly. There is a
generous selection of Whalen's poetry therein _and_ a brilliant essay
by him that is not available elsewhere.

And I agree with Dale Smith's pithy and reasonable point that if one
doesn't like Tom Clark's review and feels that Whalen deserves
better, well, then, one should write a better review. Just a thought,
but maybe John Tranter at Jacket would be delighted to have a special
section on Whalen as he has just done with Spicer? (that's a public
suggestion, John.) It would be a nice tribute to one of U.S. poetry's
most interesting individuals.

I often wonder if generic praise or gratuitous hostility is worse. If a
book sucks, why not just review something else instead? On the other hand,
the banal jacket-copy prose of many reviews ("A tour de force! The most
astonishing debut in decades! The best poet writing in English today!")
makes me long for a good old-fashioned hatchet job. I have no problem
writing a censorious review of a mediocre third or fourth or nineteenth
book by an author who enjoys the unwavering support of a major publisher:
why not enjoin the writer to please remove her or his hand from the cookie
jar? In many other cases, it seems not worth saying anything if there's
nothing nice to say. It would probably be more useful to review bad
reviewers than to review bad books. But who would read those???

a response to Whalen stuff: Clark needs to
see that often there is LITTLE PUBLIC SPACE  (newspapers atht actually
get read by the "masses") for reviews, poems, printed thots in the
world--and that publishers/newspapers, etc. WILL NOT give more than a
dab o' space for a review of poetry. Thus, your response to "write a
better one" is a good idea--but Clark took up what little space there
might be for a public proclamation.

>& can it really be true that Robert Grenier has somehow become obscure?

a relative point, it seems. I would imagine that just about every poet ever
mentioned on this list is obscure to most of the reading public, probably
even most of the poetry-reading public. On the other hand, within this
list, I would certainly hope Grenier isn't obscure. And I agree that his
work is crucial, as you say here, Tony.

agreed, kent, one might well review whalen's book oneself. I don't agree,
however, that not to do so should prevent one from remarking flaws in
another's review. This is a curious advocacy. For instance, john william
corrington's dismissive review of robert creeley's poetry is clearly
assinine even to people who never reviewed creeley, and surely they have a
right to say so. I will never review You've Got Mail, but i can tell you
that anyone who reviewed it favorably, is an idiot. db.

"Public proclamation" is an annoying reduction of the sensitive evaluation
Clark gives Whalen in this review. The trouble some have, I believe, is with
the reviewer, not the review, because the piece is clearly favorable in that
it articluates, in a short space, some complex themes of Whalen's writing.
Otherwise, there would be discussion of Whalen's work on this list, how it
works for or against TC's claims.

David:

The coincidence here is remarkable, because I have been, for
the past fourteen months, the Midwest Treasurer of the Meg Ryan Fan
Club, and You've Got Mail is one of my favorite movies ever! Do you
think I am an idiot?

But anyway, here's what I said:

Actually, I think your point above is a good one, so I will change
"should" to "could". One _could_ write a better review, and in
writing this review not only do justice to the underappreciated
Whalen but also smash into the ground the horrible face of the
terrible anti-christ Tom Clark, whose blasphemous name elicits posts
on this List like a vampire elicits crosses in a convent.

See how this moderated List helps us all to quickly agree?

Whalen broke as much ground for american poetry and poets as ginsberg or
spicer or kerouac, next to whalen's gary snyder's work looks like amy
lowell's(next to joanne kyger's snyder's work looks like amy lowell's). In
the early publications just the appearance, the calligraphy, the erasures,
the doodles shifted your reality.  His no frills syntax gave permission to
Kerouac and Acker and Bernstein alike.

This week's Mappings, my show on Antenna Internet Radio, features five
compositions by Joihn Zorn, including a lengthy collaboration between John
Zorn & Lyn Hejinian called Que Tran (pardon the missing accents), created
as one of a series of pieces by Zorn with texts & Music called New
Traditions in East Asian Bar Bands.  Performing musicians are Anthony
Coleman & Wayner Horvitz, the text is read by Anh Tran, in a Vietnamese
translation by Tu Vu.  (& I'm starting to box box things up in advance of a

it is away at war, and in the end it doesn't return ..."  Thanks.)

Next week's show (beginning Sunday July 11th, sometime before midnight West

reading and collaborations of various sorts between composer/performers and
poets.  I'll send out more details next Sunday.

Herb,

Someone else will doubtless have a bibliography more accurate than mine,
but I believe the Hejinian piece is part of a longer project that, last I
saw it in magazines, was being called "Sleeps." Part of it appeared in
Grand Street a few years back. Maybe in Conjunctions as well?
Unfortunately, I don't have an index for either of those publications, and
haven't seen further installments, other than the one on the Zorn CD, in
quite a while. And while the design of the text inserts for the CD is very
striking, the 8 point-or-so size of the text makes close reading a
difficult proposition at best.

For those who haven't previously encountered it, by the way, I highly
recommend the Zorn, which also has a text by Myung Mi Kim narrated by Jung
Hee Shin with a percussion duo played by Joey Baron and Sam Bennett; and a
text by Arto Lindsay narrated by Zhang Jinglin with guitar duo played by
Bill Frisell and Fred Frith. Glad to hear you're featuring some of this
work on Antenna.

Best,
Taylor Brady

Weird to think of published statements as taking up public (media?) space,
per Todd Baron's remarks; would it be better to leave public spaces empty,
and let thinking take care of itself in private?  And besides, who's to
limit the extent and/or duration of "public space" - aside, of course, the
usual and expected "no more room on the ad pg for YOU ... " - since all
audience not virtual and speculative on the part of the speaker is always
limited.  Those thinking to write "better" reviews of Whalen than TC is
thought by some here to have managed, could obviously post them on this
list.  Or does that not hold the possibility of "a wider readership" up to
the correct mirror?
Dale seems to've got hold of a singular point, tho - where's the news from
Whalen's actual TEXTS that spoils TCs take, given that it's there for the
spoiling to begin with.  It seems we're far removed from any critical spirit
re: Whalen, and are simply out for sport.
That being the case, might we not accompany a vendetta against TC with
several of his finer baseball poems, just for the sake of fairness?

Grenier's _12 from r h y m m s_ was published by us here at Pavement Saw
Press on a challenge by Witz that no one could put the series into
print. There are still a few of the unsigned copies available for $20.
They are 12 4-color reproductions on 25% cotton, recycled, watermarked,
color retaining paper.

To add to Charles, probably Grenier is obscure because he is still
living.

it's easy enough to evaluate Tom Clark (I'll bet he enjoys chardonnay)
because he has mustered himself into so many public venues. to describe him
as an anti-christ is interesting theology, but, without supporting argument,
not a shining example of critical acumen. I'm not worried about Tom Clark
anyway, a-c tho he might be. at the risk of making eye contact, I bet Kent
Johnson COULD provide critical acumen re PW so I hereby request that he, or
anyone, do so. me, whoever I happen to be, would welcome comments about PW.
to my view, there's a meditative, discursive breed of poetry that includes
um
PW, Lew Welch but also (I'm not suggesting a school) Carl Rakosi, Charles
Resnikov and... Paul Blackburn? my own thoughts aren't well formed, hence my
request. at any
rate, I too suspect Whalen is under-appreciated (and double that with Kyger:
I too am guilty as charged). I have On Bear Head, am not positioned to buy
anything new and have read very little about PW. Billy Little briefly
suggested some useful talking points concerning PW, and I truly doubt the
mean moderator would prevent further discussion so trip the light fantastic
step, how about. a minor buzz about PW could be bestirred right here in this
seething climate. my thinking, you see, is that theory begats action.

Interesting detail: Ron Padgett has written one book-length Memoir of
Berrigan, Tom Clark another. Can't think of any memoir concerning literary
friendships of Whalen, alas.
        Still, the review didn't seem that negative to me, either. And
Clark has done some REAL hatchet jobs in the past ("Stalin as Linguist,"
first in Poetry Flash I think and then in the neo-con Partisan Review,
comes to mind). I don't know how the SF papers operate, but could it be
that they consciously try to prevent reviews from seeming to be
advertisements or log-rollings. If I didn't know Whalen's work, I wouldn't
be put off from investigating it based on the Clark review. Then again, I
might not beat a path to the nearest independent bookstore to track it
down, either.

>n but also smash into the ground the horrible face of the

>on this List like a vampire elicits crosses in a convent

thus Kent Johnson. Now tell me, Kent (and others, should you know), is the
List's reaction to Tom Clark utterly without grounds, has he been selected
at random for extraordinary punishments, "demonized" as Kent would have it
metrely through bad luck and the need for a scapegoat.........Or is the
rhetoric flourished in the citation above, a way to distract us from some
pretty obvious flaws?

And if so, in the name of _what_ is this rhetoric flourished? Tell me,
fellow-listlings, if you can :  does TC command such loyalty in some, that
they will overlook what any person of average I.Q. (I allude to myself f
and f) would recognize in TC's writings as major inconsistencies,
unresolved conflicts, flawed thought.....or what have you?

Excuse the upcoming divagation : I had occasion once to write to the wife
of a man who had abandoned all reason and logic to castigate me publicly.
My response to this rudeness, at first reasoning, became itself rude.  To
which she now objected, inserting herself into the exchange. To which I
responded by remarking the several provocations. To this she did not
respond. To her, it was as though the words her man had uttered, that
started it all, did not exist--had not been uttered. Presumably because
somebody _she_ loved, would not proceed in such a way......despite the
evidence was under her very nose. Or somehow lacked significance because by
prior agreement with herself, her husband was without flaws---was
perfection. Hmmm, what it would have cost her, to admit otherwise!

What is it about Tom Clark that inspires this connubial kind of loyalty in
his admirers, a bond that will not admit his faults?

And, cororally, are we able to perceive a pattern, are these supporters in
other ways similar to one another? Does the School of Clark consist of
persons Contented with their Blind Spots?

Maybe exercises this exhaustive aren't necessary. Let's simply ask that
Kent or Dale or whomever put some piece of TC's up here where we can all
read it, some piece that commands their admiration; and then we who would
be interested in such engagement, can point out its shortcomings, and in
this way, educate.  Or, unlikely but possible, declare ourselves as a-brim
as they with admiration, and bow out.

Rider : If "De gustibus non disputandum" were the rubric proceeded under in
this thread, there could be no dispute. If I recall aright, the dispute
began with Steve Vincent remarking on internal conflicts --- taste-disputes
--- in the TC piece on Whalen. It is TC's dispute with himself we address,
then, a dispute he has made our business in making it public.

And surely TC can stand the heat and not vacate the kitchen. Why are his
fans so protective of him?  Is there a mindlessness which he performs, that
they feel he performs in their behalf?  So that they do not mind him, but
mind those who would remove the protective caul?

THere should be none. A writer should only submit work to publications
s/he is reading and familiar with. Thus, the letter is not an attempt to
get one's work "in print" but rather a statement of desire to enter into
the dialogue the publication seeks to engage.  At ReMap we get a hundred
(yup!) submissions a year from folks who are not familiar with ReMap.
This is obvious from the "generic" letters that accompany the work. As
we struggle to stay in print ($) and (readers) we simply send this work
back--. We're not trying to publish only those poets we know--but we do
struggle to publish the poets who know the magazine.

Geez: Let me put it more simply: The larger more widely read newspapers
(LA TIMES, NY TIMES, etc. only allow a few poetry reviews per YEAR! THe
public space I was talking about was these publications (Mr. Clark is
widely published on those pages). My remark was only meant to say "IF
indeed there is LIMITED space--the reviews shold be well enaged with the
work--try to help the work get new readers--and not do otherwise. That
is if the reviews are written by those who care to engage in the
dialogue of the work most poets try to produce. That is--DIALOGUE!

ps: Thus--don't waste "public space"

David:

I believe I said the Chronicle critic's piece left me pisst off - which 'en
vulgatis' (fairly enough) might be considered a dispute of "taste." But taste
in some over-refined literary sense, I don't think so. Clark just missed the
Bear, preferring for whatever malevolent or, perhaps, some innocent intent,
to quibble in the scat.

However it sounds like you want to go to war or continue one. The 100 Year
Civil Guerre de Clark - I can see it into the far future. But is that one -
the focus on Clark  - worth the yield? In this case, perhaps a contrary
without a progression? I think I'll stick to Whalen, Grenier and other lights
instead of what I sense will be bleak.



Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

David: I would like to say that I am not a member of any Tom Clark
school. I am not even a "fan" of his work, not knowing it that well.
My point is that there is evidence hereabouts of knee-jerk reaction
to his persona and writings and that this stems from old and stale
history. The fact that his Jacket review of Whalen is perfectly
adoring of its subject proves my point. There is nothing at all about
the review that calls _anything_ in Whalen into question! It's OK, I
guess, to hold a grudge against Tom Clark for his past tirades
against Langpo, but time has passed those polemics by,
really. Why rail agaisnt the man for calling attention to the genius
of a neglected poet most of us agree richly deserves the credit?

In any case, this little exchange has proven fruitful, for I'm told
it has prodded John Tranter to plan a special feature on Whalen a la
very fine Spicer feature edited by Chris Alexander in Jacket #7.
Hurrah!

And Jordan, true about spirals being bounded, as all forms are bound
to something or by something. But some bounded things _bind_ more
than other bounded things. Obviously. And as for the pseudonym, I
would see that as a kind of closed circle-- a circle covering over
another one, so actually not much gained there. There must be
something more: A way of imagining writing like Smithson had begun to
imagine art. Authors are flat circles, like coins, tossed into a dead
lake.

"The Barn is a play about a family of voices. The voice,
and the family, as shelters and constraints. Domestic
tasks as the physical equivalents of fantasies -- the
impossibility of containing either within pastoral romance,
but the constant desire for this. It is a play about the possibility
of being far away from the landscape, and the voice."

Perhaps "flawed thoughts", Mr. Bromige, are those that lack the
"inconsistencies" and "unresolved conflicts" that many of us in the
world live with (you know, there is that whole nasty business with Blake
about contradictions). While your confidence in the post below reveals a
singular spirit of high minded moral and aesthetic integrity, I assume that
if anyone is interested they can go to JACKET's site and wrestle with TC's
flawed prose on their own, or, better yet, read one of his books. The point
I think some of us wish to make is that Whalen should be the focus of
discussion, (his own twisted inconsistencies aside), since, as I hope, his
work, tentativley, fueled the impulse toward greater engagement with this
thread. I for one would prefer to see this conversation move toward an
evaluative or critical discussion of OVERTIME, since it is the first
representative sampling of that Beat Abbot's poems in many years. Devotion,
by the way, doesn't create blind spots so much as highten with critical
measure another's flaws. But I will defend my teacher's name when he is
unjustly accused of doing a hatchet job. Only a handful of people read such
ugly claims into that review. (Philip himself was pleased with it!). You and
others want to turn the conversation away from the positive critical
possibilities that could attend a discussion of Whalen's work by slugging
through the same old drudge. Let TC continue to deal with the consequences
of his past deeds. For some reason, many of you here are dealing with those
consequences too, instead of attending more urgent issues of poetry. I've
heard every opinion about the man and his work from those whose confidence
only measures value by the approval of greater markets than themselves. The
hypocritical gestures of consistency make nice rhetorical poses, but I think
the stance below is too transparent to be read by anyone as anything more
than a reductive, impotent war dance. I'll end my own rhetorical appeal with
a poem of Philip's from "Many Happy Returns" written, it says, for Tom
Clark:

on the list might want to correspond with Indrek Tart directly (e-mail
address at end) and/or send some small press publications to a lovely
cause (read through to the end of the letter).

>><< Dear Ms. W,
>> I’m a poet and cultural studies researcher (b. 1946) in Estonia at the
>> Baltic sea.
>> Estonia has through its rise of the national consciousness from the
>> first part of XIXth century (after abandoning the serfdom) built its
>> identity around the Estonian language in which poetry had played a
>> leading role. Especially under colonizing rules of Czar-Russia up to
>> 1918 and under Soviets (1944-91) poetry has been the most secret
>> language of the nation to keep its mind safe and sane.
>> In 1992 I was in the States in International Writing Program at the
>> University of Iowa which is now in unfavor and will be closed. As I
>> understand it was the main gate for the States to host foreign writers
>> and let them know the States better. It were very useful three months
>> for me. I visited mine pen-friends and talked a lot of poetries
>> situation in both countries. My library of English-language poetry is
>> quite great.
>> Now after the unrest years of transition (I personally had to change a
>> profession of the physicist into a social scientist one) Estonia seems
>> to be settled into the Western way of living again (Western way of
>> thinking here wasn’t never lost, even under the Soviets we were regarded
>> as the more developed Western part of that country). And along with mine
>> research of Estonia’s poetical development in 1851-1998 I’m again
>> engaged with thoughts of more international views on poetry’s being.
>> Poetry is not a capitalist business-like commodity for sale but
>> something preserving nation and humanity by itself under different
>> pressures of times and its share in the book production titles in
>> developed and transitional countries is not minimal (2-6%). Thus it
>> functions for survival of the nations (and communities, e.g. Estonians
>> exiled to the West in 1944 had to rebuild Estonian literature in abroad
>> and it was successful project until the end of the Cold War). Also I’m
>> thinking of generational likeliness (poetry of poets born around the
>> same time) and the influence of age, gender and global cultural climate
>> (if that exists?) on poets’ writing. Are poets just lost souls from the
>> past or future or gaining importance only due ideals practitioned in
>> locality (abstractions pressed into local language use) or contrary the
>> locality makes them to overgrow it and become citizens of the Heavenly
>> Thought? Also, how our living (life-world in sociological terms) in
>> language makes poetry unnecessary? Etc. Etc.
>> ***As a small start I’m looking for fresher poetry from the States to
>> compile a small anthology and translate it into Estonian. I hope that

Dear Ms. Wald,
You could spread my call for help in any convenient
way.  I'm really interested in which kind of poetry is written and read
in this Networked Societies Age and how poetry transforms under those
new pressures and opportunities. As I'm convinced of poetry's special
role in maintaining mental health of the mankind. I'm interested in
Yours list too, by now I'm more looking developments in British & Irish
Poetry list lead by my friend Ric Caddell who is librarian and head of
the Basil Bunting Poetry Centre in Durham (UK).
Also in Boston area lives my long time friend Marge Piercy who's e-mail
has been lost in my computer crash last year. If You could find it out
it will be marvelous (in A Directory of Poets & Fiction Writers there is
only a homepage of her but non e-mail in it.
Best wishes,
Indrek Tart

I'll tell you about the first Whalen reading I heard. It was in a big room
at UBC during the '63 poetry summer of legend. After about fifteen minutes,
Whalen could tell that a lot of people in the room could not handle his
discontinuous poems with white space between the lines, so he stopped and
sd it wd not bother him if the people who were bored and uncomfortable went
on out to the cafeteria or some such place. He would take a five minute
break and let folks get out with no guilt. Then everyone that was left,
about half the crowd, skoonched down close, and Whalen read for about an
hour and a half,. and it was just wonderful--and you know: I think it was
even more wonderful for the kind and sharp action he'd taken.

The Sound Poetry CD, Carnivocal, Explodes the Boundaries of Poetry

Red Deer, AB, June 24, 1999 - While all types of poetry experiment with
language and meaning, no type of poetry pushes at the boundaries of
language and meaning quite as much as sound poetry. Most people come to
poetry through the medium of the written word, but sound poetry offers a
completely different, more sensory experience. Sound poetry cannot be
written down, cannot be captured into writing - it must be heard. In order t=
o
fully understand it and to capture its evocative power, listeners must sit
back in a comfortable, reclining chair and place this unique CD into their
CD player. As Edita Petrauskaite, the Executive Director of the League of
Canadian Poets, says, "Close your eyes, sit back and let the poetry take
you."

Sound poetry has evolved into an experimental and powerful medium and it
explores all forms of sound, not just the varieties of sound which form
human speech. However, as Carnivocal editors and sound poets Stephen Scobie
and Doug Barbour say: "Sound poetry is the celebration of all the
expressive possibilities of the human voice."

Sound poetry dates back at least to the experiments of the Dada poets such
as Kurt Schwitters and Hugo Ball. In Canada, it has been string since the
1960s, when bp Nichol and bill bissett began exploring and reinventing its
traditions. In the 1990s, a new generation of sound poets has revitalized
the Canadian tradition and on this CD their voices sound alongside many of
the best-known earlier practitioners. Carnivocal presents a range of
contemporary solo performers including: bp Nichol, bill bissett, Stephen
Cain, Gerry Shikatani, Claude Gauvreau, Christian B=F6k, Penn Kemp, W. Mark
Sutherland, Richard Truhlar, Penn Kemp, Paul Dutton, Steve McCaffery, &
Steven Ross Smith; and various ensembles, including a classic recording by
The Horsemen and Owen Sound,as well as groups such as Re:Sounding, First
Draft and the exciting new sounds of Verbomotorhead.

Douglas Barbour and Stephen Scobie first began performing together as the
poetry vocal ensemble Re:Sounding in the mid-1970s. As well-known poets and
critics, they have produced between the two of them over twenty volumes of
poetry and criticism. Stephen Scobie won the Governor General's Award for
Poetry and Douglas Barbour won the Stephan G. Stephansson Award for Poetry.

          ________________________________________________
                           LAST  STORIES

Mostly it seems they're all we have, really.  After the 'procession of
priests' (theoria) has precessed past our increasingly narrow attention
span; after the bombs have dropped (and before, for that matter); when the
guy in the ape suit is throwing the bone up in '2001' (goodbye Stanley)
and when we catch it in the hear, and gnaw, we who live in the future, on
those bones, those very ancient lineaments, we who are sighting along the
'scope hairs, looking for the next target of acquisition...well, stories
are what we started with and stories are what we still have.

But just to make it a little more focused and to satisfy our own need for
eschatology (both singular and global): why don't we say that we only have
a limited amount of time to live (after all is said and done, this may
come of news to some of us) or that the Third Millennium will come a
cropper and leave us poor humans face down (of course, no one really
believes that...but we're telling stories remember?)

Pehaps you have a last will and testiment you would like to send us, or a
death bed confession, or a lie you can't stop believing in but will be
glad when it's all over, or that peculiar need to expose yourself,
whistleblow on yourself, that often attacks those at the end.

 Or maybe you have a happy story of the end/End wherein your life flashes
before you (and hence us since you will send it to us) and it was a photo
finish, but a good one nevertheless, set'm up Finnegan; or the species
rounds the corner finally into its Golden Dawn, every Thing finds its
place, the animals speak; or you have a Final Theory of Everything at the
end which redeems us all and makes the whole trip worthwhile...

Personal stories, theoretical stories, endings which are beginnings,
eschatological fairy tales, lies (the end of truth), fables (the lying
truth after the end), happy endings, tragic endings, tales with nothing
but pictures for those of us who find it increasingly hard to read here in
the future and thus closer to the end....  send them all to us.

while there's still some time left.

Beginning in the fall of 1998, Nada Gordon, then living in Tokyo, and Gary
Sullivan, who'd moved to New York the previous year, began a daily
correspondence that culminated in April of 1999 with Nada's return to the
U.S. after 11 years in Japan. Prior to ever meeting one another, the couple
produced and exchanged 1,000s of pages of letters, poems, anecdotes,
theoretical musings, gossip, bibliomancy--anything & everything to keep
their connection open and abuzz despite being halfway around the globe from
each other. Nada and Gary will read poems and other excerpts from their
correspondence.

NADA GORDON is the author of _rodomontade_, _more hungry_ and _lip_, and
co-edited the magazine _Aya_. A new collection, _Foriegnn Bodie_, will be
published this fall. Her writing has appeared in numerous periodicals over
the years including _Chain_, _Jimmy & Lucy's House of K_, _Printed Matter_
and (from their exchange) _The East Village Poetry Web_ at:
http://www.geocities.com/~theeastvillage/a6/gordon/a.htm

GARY SULLIVAN is the author of _Dead Man_, and edits Detour Press and
_Read.Me_. _The Art of Poetry_ is forthcoming later this year. His writing
and cartoons have appeared in numerous places, including _The Gertrude Stein
Awards 1994-1995_, the _o.blek_ "New Coast" issue, _Avec_, _Rain Taxi_, _The
SF Weekly_, _Talisman_, _Tool: A Magazine_, _The World_ and (from their
exchange) _The East Village Poetry Web_ at:

City Lights Books, for which I work, has just published a new
anthology, REVOLUTIONARY ROMANTICISM, edited by Max Blechman.

Some on the list may know Max, and I was the in-house editor
on this book. In any case, there's much here that should appeal.

What follows is a little write-up, including the table of contents,
some of the back cover copy, and ordering information. There's
also a link to a review that has just come out in the San Francisco
Bay Guardian.

REVOLUTIONARY ROMANTICSM

A Drunken Boat Anthology

Edited by Max Blechman

250 pgs. / $15.95 / ISBN 0-87286-351-4 / City Lights Books

Individual orders: http://www.citylights.com/CLorder.html

REVOLUTIONARY ROMANTICISM draws on almost two centuries
of intertwined traditions of cultural and political subversion.
In this rich collection of writings by artists, scholars, and
revolutionaries, the transgressions of the past are recaptured
and transvalued for the benefit of the struggles of today and
tomorrow.

"Drunken Boat is a courageous and worthy effort to maintain
alive, in a difficult period, unfettered critical thinking.
It ought to be supported by all who care about freedom and
justice." - Cornelius Castoriadis, author of The Imaginary
        Institution of Society

"In a period when politics is dreary and political art cliched,
Drunken Boat is brilliantly alive and unconventional. It summons
up a world where subversion spelled art and art spelled liberation;
but Drunken Boat is more than a blast from the past: it speaks to
the present. Drunken Boat is the vessel of choice for those bored
with chartered cruises and organized day-trips." - Russell Jacoby,
        author of The Last Intellectuals

This is just a bibliographical note, but I didn't want to not notice a
note on DNA several days back and it brought to mind quite a long
posting to this list on the subject when I first joined, something about
the pseudo-scientific junk being passed off as research in certain U.S.
academic circles.  This was news to me, as is Jack Barnes' answer to a
worker's question about THE BELL CURVE in the transcript of a Talk
included in CAPITALISM'S WORLD DISORDER:  WORKING CLASS POLITICS AT THE
MILLENIUM (Ed. Steve Clark, Pathfinder Press, NY, 1999).  Here's the
question and some of the answer:

"Comment:  You had some things to say earlier today about Yale
economists.  I wonder what your opinion is of the Harvard professors who
came up with THE BELL CURVE.  I'm especially interested in why it is
that THE BELL CURVE has made such a splash in the public debate in the
media.  Why is it every decade or so, it seems, this theory of
genetically determined intellectual superiority or racial superiority
gets regurgitated and debated and debunked, and then comes back in
another form?

Response:  If my memory serves me right, I think only one of the
authors--Richard Hernrnstein--was a Harvard professor; he just died. I
think Murray is currently hired by one of the reactionary think tanks in
Washington, D.C.--the American Enterprise Institute. [One page content
paraphrase].
        Now let's say it another way:  We're rich.  We're rich because we're
smart.  You can tell we're smart because we're rich.  Because we're
smart and rich, our kids are smart, and are going to be rich too.  But
there are a lot of people who aren't getting rich, and they can't seem
to accept the fact that this is simply because their forebears were
dumb.  The liberals--those who are rich and those who aren't--know this
and live by it, but are embarrassed to say so.  Most people, however,
mistakenly think there is some connection between what we're doing to
get rich and their own deteriorating quality of life.  We're getting
more isolated in that sense, and a little nervous about anyone wanting
to take our privileges away.  But we want to enjoy being rich.  There is
nothing to feel guilty about.  We're rich because we're smart.
        That is about the long and short of it.
        Then the book ends up with some proposals about what to do with all of
us "at the bottom end of the cognitive ability distribution"--orphanages
and so on, some of the things we have discussed already.  If we can
"face reality about the underclass," the book says, then we can provide
"the opportunity for everyone, not just the lucky ones, to live a
satisfying life."  That is, you can learn to like being poor (or to be
made to pretend to like it).
        But this is only possible, the book says, if we get rid of all the
social programs and legislation that fly in the face of accepting this
reality, such as the minimum wage; affirmative action; more money for
public education ("For many people, there is nothing they can learn that
will repay the cost of the teaching"--my favorite sentence in the book);
the extension of Social Security protections; welfare payments; and so on.
        The book is a retread of discredited views, but not primarily
pseudoscientific ones about IQ, genetics, and so on.  It has that too,
but that is not the main point. The book is subtitled, "Intelligence and
Class Structure in American Life"  That is what it is about.  It is
about social class above all, more than it is about race."

I don't submit this quotation as definitive on the subject, but more as
a directional mark towards a book by the National Secretary of the
Socialist Workers Party whose first chapter is titled:  A SEA CHANGE IN
WORKING CLASS POLITICS.  These are talks, not writings.  "A transcript
of speech acts that for the most part come out of another language often
conveniently designated as occupying a position of power, a definition
that serves to consign the language of politics to a force (ideology)
whose nature it is to dominate, if not destroy, the materiality of
signs, and helps to construct an opposition between the Political and
Poetical harmful to both languages, isolating them in an opposition that
would seem to derive from the private reading of revolutionary writings
relegated to the library (the dustbin of history), and not the
experience of politics and the Political Imaginary in all the fragility
and provisionality of its articulation by participants, activists whose
inflections have helped here, at least, to locate a series or set of
lyric gestures." [CHAIN / 3 vol. 2, p. 140].

By way of acknowledgment, it is probably as good a time as any to
mention that the source-words for "FEBRUARY 24, 1991" in THE ROAD TO
BASRA suite of poems that appeared in CONJUNCTIONS 30 come from a speech
by Jack Barnes given in Cleveland shortly after the Iraq bombing
campaign though I wrote them out of the transcript that appears in the
SWP's theoretical journal, NEW INTERNATIONAL (they broke with the Fourth
International in the 70's I think, at the time of their 'turn' back to
the industrial unions).  My second book, RECENT EVENTS, simply cannot be
read without taking into account the documentary lyricism which records
my contact and involvement and sincere admiration for the union
militants I met in Iowa at the time of the meatpacking strikewave in
1986-88.  Many of the folks named in that book are still active leaders,
like Nan Bailey and Betsy Stone.

Finally, who is Jack Barnes?  You can look at an early, perhaps the
first, SNAPSHOT of him in THE LIFE AND PHILOSOPHY OF MALCOLM X (ed.
Sande Smith, Bromptom Books Corp., 1993), p. 61.  A youth, four chairs
in from the aisle, sitting in the front row of a packed auditorium on
June 24, 1964--the day Malcolm announced the forming of the Organization
of African American Unity.  I found this photograph by accident, in a
book among a number of books about African American history and politics
on Albertine Boclear's bookshelf.

A perfectly interesting and reasonable challenge, ..cutting across SF

discursive works);

...could the breadth and spreading-out feel of most (or all) of these

understood in the final analysis as a *reaching back and around* toward
whitman?  --"around" would acknowledge the fact that Olson among others are

do so in a techno-intense way that looses a certain walt'ish generolsity of

There is a nice piece on Trane DeVore and his new book from Avec in today's
SF Chron,

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/07/09

Unlike the Whalen review a few weeks ago, this is a genuinely nice piece,
even if it makes a
bit too much of Trane's grandparentage....  (perhaps that should be two
words).

All true, though poetics list folks should be aware that, just as the

Dear Katy,

I attended the Poetry & Pedagogy conference at Bard in late june 1999.  I=20
enjoyed myself despite the fact that I am not a teacher of writing and even=20
found myself wondering a lot about how rhetoric or poetics i suppose i mean=20
gets formed and polarized around poetry and how these battles are fairly=20
important when it's really young minds (and less reputations & canon fodder)=20
that are being thrown around.  Here brain gue.  There brain goo.  The sense=20
of people who work in trenches. =20

At other times i found myself thinking i am lucky not to have to continually=20
come up with (job) watered down catch phrases to describe the poetry i like=20
and dislike and otherwise don't care about and to have to publish "that" typ=
e=20
of discourse as if my livelihood depended on it.  This thought was a result=20
of listening to a paper by Bob Perelman who gave an interesting list of blan=
d=20
sentences that come out of his mouth when "difficult" poetry is explained to=20
a general undergraduate, graduate and/or hiring, tenure committee audience: =20
"This is a standard academic narrative; the standard remedy is abbreviation.=
"

*=09So that "To Elsie" of Spring & All becomes:  "the conflict between=20
democratic diction and high modernist innovation, with cars, immigration,=20
gender and class mentioned."

*=09"Love Songs to Johannes" becomes:  "path-breaking eroticism, perhaps=20
with sidelong comparative glances thrown at The Waste Land and Edna St.=20
Vincent Millay's sonnets."

*=09Tender Buttons becomes:  "examples of a literary version of Cubist=20
portraiture . . . as well as issues of domestic space and lesbian erotics vs=
.=20
surveillance."

This problem was sort of enacted when the critic Lynn Keller delivered a=20
paper, posing two models of reading/composition:  centrifugal and=20
centripetal.  The centripetal model pulls everything in and is basically a=20
closed text; centrifugal tends outward and is open.  She further posed that=20
Edward Hirsch's new book How to Read a Poem and Fall in Love with Poetry=20
represented the closed model, then put up Joan Retallack's Icarus Falling as=20
a model of the open.  There was a break in the talk and Jackson Mac Low aske=
d=20
me to bring him his water bottle.  Luckily I happened to be wearing a t-shir=
t=20
that said i love the topaz man (with nipple enhanced picture of fabbio=20
precursor) on the front and i love topaz romance books on the back.  My shir=
t=20
made an intervention at the conference that said Lynn, I don't think the=20
opposition between centripetal and centrifugal is interesting, but your=20
reading of Retallack is and seems like one of the few pedagogical moments of=20
the conference. =20

Talking with Lynn after her paper I said I wish there hadn't been so many=20
uncritical valorizations of the experimental/avant-garde.  I don't remember=20
what she said to that, but I do remember she said she was nervous about the=20
off-campus education discussion (see below) because she wanted the classroom=20
to be the central place for poetic work and discovery to take place.  I told=20
her I thought she was probably a good teacher. =20

In the afternoon it was often announced we could have juice and cookies in=20
the foyer.  It was at these moments where I felt myself to be squarely=20
inhabiting America.  American conferences don't serve alcohol until, at the=20
earliest, "cocktail hour", but usually you have to wait until dinner. =20
Compare this to France's 11:30 am "scotch time".  Americans, as we learn fro=
m=20
Ben Franklin's visit to English factories, should not drink ale at break=20
time. =20

In American venues we also see the phenomenon of event packing in that there=20
is no time between events to rest and, as Cecilia Vicu=F1a reminded us, to h=
eal=20
the dendrites.  She also reminded us that the siesta in Spain was going=20
bye-bye due to the new euro.  Certain types of work are best accomplished,=20
and we need only look at American world domination to demonstrate this, when=20
a pre-ordained schedule is executed according to plan, when the random=20
elements are minimized. =20

That being said, there were a few moments of randomness and conscious=20
attempts to bring this in to how poetry gets made, and here I am thinking of=20
Bob Perelman's and Michael Davidson's comments regarding their off-campus=20
education, that real learning about poetry takes place in bars and at=20
readings and at informal talks in living rooms.  There was a certain sense o=
f=20
nostalgia about their comments, as if that off-campus culture they described=20
was an infrequent visitor in their current lives, and for them I imagine the=20
conference itself became a substitute for this lack.  I myself went to the=20
conference for this very reason.  I knew some of my friends were going to be=20
there.  Well, I crashed the conference because my girl friend was one of the=20
organizers. =20

It was during Perelman's talk, the "procedure" panel, that I asked about=20
Bob's education (he thought I asked about "Bob's agitation") and whether he=20
could describe some procedures for creating or being involved in off-campus=20
poetry "scenes", as the few comments I had heard up to this point regarding=20
this extra-curricular activity seemed to suggest that poetry was something=20
that happened to oneself spontaneously upon entering a bar.  He replied that=20
talks and bars were good, but that it was hard work.  Lyn Hejinian also said=20
it was hard work.  There's that word again. =20

Mytili Jagannathan mentioned Writer's House at UPENN as a place where that=20
kind of randomness has been cultivated, and Louis Cabri made similar remarks=20
towards the close of the conference, viz that if "you" have a physical space=20
that can be brought to bear serially (get people to show up at) and, if you=20
have some cash, things will take care of themselves.  Juliana Spahr--while=20
acknowledging the importance of the interesting things that have been=20
emerging from Writer's House and how it seems to be at least partially=20
responsible for hooking people up in Philadelphia and adding energy to the=20
local communities (witness recent spilling out onto streets)--wanted to=20
counter this landed model with a landless one, where books, mags, readings,=20
exist as collaborative venues.  Her point being not oppositional, but=20
supplementary, in that there are not that many places in the world where=20
enough people would actually go to a physical space on a regular basis so=20
that the threshold level of erotic randomness that facilitates the exchange=20
of poetic energy could be reached if not overcome.  Actually, Juliana didn't=20
say all that. =20

Aside from the papers and working groups and questions and answers, there=20
were some good moments of on-campus late nite drinking (the Bard cops smile=20
at you and seem to want you to have fun on their watch), a dinner with Rober=
t=20
Kelly who is fun in a naughty way, a trip to the swimming hole (quarry), and=20
a party at Emilie Clark's house in whose yard a field of fireflies was busy=20
tearing the veil off the continuous.  Is such a display truly random? =20

There were also some excellent readings.  I don't think I had the occasion t=
o=20
say to myself or to a friend behind closed doors "that" reading sucked, whic=
h=20
is odd because there were 16 readings.  The first nite we heard Michael=20
Davidson, Harryette Mullen, Lyn Hejinian, Bob Perelman, & Ann Lauterbauch. =20
The next day we heard Edwin Torres and Anne Tardos read and discuss their=20
work.  That nite, we heard Caroline Bergvall, Robert Kelley, Jena Osman, Joa=
n=20
Retallack, Juliana Spahr and Cecilia Vicu=F1a.  Saturday afternoon we went t=
o a=20
very hot little chapel and heard Bernadette Mayer (she said tubecabra) and=20
Jackson Mac Low (he said security strawberries), and at nite were treated to=20
a sound painting conducted by Walter Thompson, with members of the conferenc=
e=20
making noises at the behest of his fingers.

As for the papers, I can't make the claim I made above.  What I tended to=20
find lacking in the papers were actual pedagogical procedures that could be=20
re-used to illuminate "difficult" works in general and/or procedures that=20
would pertain to particular works.  I mean even I have some tricks I use whe=
n=20
I'm invited to a poetry workshop to read my work and discuss.  I just didn't=20
come away from this conference with a sense of how these people do their=20
jobs, their work. =20

Perhaps this was because I didn't attend the working groups, but rested=20
dendrites instead.  These working groups consisted of a leader guiding six t=
o=20
ten people thru various "peter elbow-like" reading and writing exercises=20
using "difficult" source texts.  The general feeling I got from people who=20
did participate was that they were too tired to really put any energy into i=
t=20
and thus did not enjoy it and did not learn.  My unscholarly opinion is that=20
it might have been more interesting to have made the working groups the focu=
s=20
of the conference, rather than the papers.  That said, I was happy to have=20
attended Poetry & Pedagogy: The Challenge of the Contemporary: a four-day=20
symposium in the form of a collaborative investigation, as I had fun with=20
friends and met some interesting people.

love,=20

Bill, thanks for these interesting riffs on the Bard conference.  I've
written a few comments below which I thought might interest some folks on
the list.  -m.

 According to Maz881@AOL.COM:

This is just a pot shot, isn't it Bill?  There's seems to be an odd
compulsion to throw tomatoes whenever Bob arrives in New York despite (or
because of?) the obvious debts owed by many of the hurlers.  Do you
actually disagree with any of these "bland sentences which come out of his
mouth"?  Or are you merely lamenting that the context of a conference
tends to short circuit more complex exchanges?  I can say from my own
experiences that Bob has had many such complex exchanges involving all
these texts, quite illuminating exchanges really - "Love Songs to
Johannes" was the subject of half-a-day's conversation with some grads and
undergrads at his place, informally, over bagels and coffee.  The point
being that pithy sentences are sometimes just annotations of extended
thought and conversation - not the markers of institutional conspiracy.

I'm glad you asked Bob about his off-campus education - and while I
wouldn't be surprised if there was a hint of nostalgia in the discussion
of the "good old days" I can also say that he's been energized and
instrumental in creating that atmosphere at the Philly Writers House which
Mytili Jagannathan and Louis Cabri mentioned at Bard and which you mention
below.  I can say also, that Juliana's "landless model" of poetic
community is relevant to the Writers House as well - having moved to Rhode
Island, it's the model of my current relationship with the House, and it
works pretty well - keeping in touch and active through various email
listservs, through publications like PhillyTalks, CrossConnect and Combo,
and through the occasional trip down for readings attended, sponsored or
given.  Anyway, thought I'd put in 2 cents.  I hope others will agree that
the agon between young and old (or for that matter between academic and
non-academic) is a pretty tired model for interaction between and among
artists.  Certainly in Bob's case it breaks down on every level.

Dear Bill: (Bill who?) I liked your Bard letter to Katy. It sounded like a
fun place to be, or your take on it was fun. "Lacademia" is a pun that comes
to mind. But I do think the fights and progressions in bars & independent
venues like the old Langton Arts talks of which Bob Perleman was central, and
now Small Press Traffic (here in San Francisco) usually become most valuable
after the college or University. It's maybe a post-Doc or a pre-Doc while
first books and magazines begin to emerge. Then there is the phenomenon of
getting older (& otherwise obligated) in which it takes great strength to
survive as a poet and to create supportive groups outside academia (otherwise
an isolation reappears, which is perhaps not too much different from
adolescence). On the other hand, those of us outside watch those within
academia struggle to not get their creative identities smothered or
caricatured by the very institutional and student support that provides a
professional life and public identity as a poet. Indeed institutions might
mean another kind of isolation. Some clearly rise with it and some fall. But
that's true outside, as well. By all accounts poetry is a problematic and
curious career choice!

Fortunately I sense the Net creates a new public space for the poet and the
work, the value and significance of which is still defining itself. John
Tranter, the editor of Jacket, says the magazine site has received over a
100,000 visits (not "hits"). Given that most poetry books from small presses
rarely sell more than 500 copies,
that's a revolution. What it means as a transformation of readership and
community, I wonder. Pound, in the hey day of the Cantos, thought 500 good
readers was as much as he could expect, in fact, I believe, from his place on
the mountain, that was all he required. Five good listeners and readers
around a table in a local bar can be very good company. It's nice (for me) to
imagine a community that mixes the local, the academic and the net. Each of
these sites an ongoing intervention on the others (T-shirts included).

Again, thanks for publicly sharing your letter.

Cheers, Stephen Vincent

An interesting synchronicital (?) conflation of the recent posts by Bill
Luoma and Kevin Magee:

I had two pals who attended the Bard Conference, one presenter not mentioned
by Bill, Page du Bois (who gave a talk on one page of Alice Notley's
"Descent of Alette") and her husband, the poet and lawyer John Daley.

John had the experience of being in a seminar where a professor from one of
the University of California campuses was droning on about the various
levels of meaning in a poem. After about twenty minutes or so, and at a
pause in the recital, Bernadette asked "Are you rich?"

Working hard and staying out of bars,

I am finding on this reading of PW a multi-layered meditation on the way
the mind works in meditation and reading and writing poetry - also the
way the body responds.  Simply put (or oversimplified) meditation is not
what you meditate on but how you (or the poet or the "non-self" in both
zen and postmodern senses).  For me this adds a whole new ?dimension? to
lyric, beat, process, and/or language readings, possibly seen as a
precurser to web based or hypertext poetry (acknowledgement here to
Leslie Scalapino's intro).

The Opening


My arms circle Azure, if she lets me. I may walk around her, if she is
standing still, sitting in a chair, and she may let me speak to her, her
speaking in return, as words shadow and foreshadow the indolent air of
dusk. Lights glimmer in the distant, her red-brown hair outlined ever so
faintly in the gathering dark. I have no control over the liquidity of
phrase and subject; saying spreads like eddies across the sky. Azure, I
say, her name like tendrils upon the wall of time, I want to, to describe,
how words lengthen in the air, and how, in cyberspace, they remain commit-
ted to the line, no matter the depths of revelation. I want to show how
the lines or paragraphs become lines or paragraphs, huddle and tumble upon
one another, and how, in real life, the world is filled with gaps, with
longing, how the world in real life is always already a world of longing.
Of projects unfulfilled, Azure says, and I say not even projects, not even
unfulfilled, but of the laziness of longing, the waiting that has no goal,
the murmurs of voices close upon the evening air. How life is always a
yearning, how the planet yearns, how waiting need not involve expectancy,
but only a loving silence, how we need to learn, to listen to that sil-
ence.

Nikuko, Julu, Alan, Jennifer, recede into the shadows. They too have wait-
ed, but their words are huddled, their time always timed or in lag, a
slightly darker sky surrounding them. They cannot hear the sounds of tree-
frogs, and fireflies remains descriptions of dreams they have been given.
The world returns to Azure, Alan, and

Her arms encircle Alan, if he lets her, their faces round as moons.

I too have been annoyed to receive submissions bundled with little press
packages that either distract from the submitted work or else just about
scream
the writer's ignorance of literary magazines. Lists of prizes get my goat,
especially when they include "honorable mention" "So-and-so advised me to send
you this" is another. And so on: it makes me want to draft a lawyerly document
brimming with specific guidelines.

But the "what editors prefer" approach, it seems to me, is part of the
problem---since it turns *sharing* work into *scoring with* it, and applies
conformist pressure to a submission pool. If you want to join a club, then buy
all the back issues, find out what editors love and hate, and then market
yourself accordingly. If you want to write what you want to write, then go
ahead---cover letter or no, CV or no, lifetime subscriber or no, list of
publications or no, personal contact or no, part of the community or no. Any
vital publication values surprise, for which no one need be wearing the right
shoes.

Yes,

at Fence we get about 30 unsolicited mss a week.

 I think it's relevant to note that if we had as many subscribers as we
have submitters--or even half as many--we'd be golden. We'd be in heaven. I
do believe that the discrepancy between the two constituencies (subscribers
and submitters) causes many editors to throw up their hands in chagrin at
times.

The best cover letter is:

brief, as in, two very short paragraphs. One paragraph says where you
saw/read/purchased whichever lovely journal is in question and what there
is about the journal that made you want to be included in its pages (stroke
the editors and show them that you've really considered the journal); the
next gives a short list of other publications and/or honors.

No point mentioning:

where you went to school, who you studied with, your own opinion of your
work and what your work is attempting/approaching/essaying.

I second the caution against including a vita or a pre-printed list of the
journals your work has appeared in. It just goes straight into the
recycling bin.

Thanks for giving me this opportunity.

Bill is Mister William Luoma,
one of the better second basemen of our day.

And I want to second what Mr. Magee says of Philly.
Plus with sites like Highwire Gallery, Giovanni's Room
(where Sam'l R. Delaney is reading the day after I leave
for Nova Scotia!?! at the end of this month).

But that nostalgia people have referred to is I think also for a more
uncomplicated social space in which one could make one's mistakes in
something akin to private. It was all pretty heady in the old days when
Steve Vincent would think to call up the Grand Piano Coffee House to
announce the birth, minutes before, of his child (no doubt all grown up by
now!).

Poetics Folks,

At CrossConnect, we have a slightly different system for weeding out
those who are interested in sending their manunscripts blind to every
yutz with an email address and those who are putting any small amount of
thought into what they are sending and to whom they are sending it.  As
we are primarily an electronic magazine, we force those who are
interested in in submitting to *request our guidelines for submitting*
first.  I would say that we get about 5-7 requests for guidelines per
day.  Even these are loaded with 1)  compliments to the magazine, 2)
attempts to make the requestee look quirky and interesting,  3)  previous
publication credits.  When I reply to these requests, unless the person
requesting the guidelines has asked me a specigfic question in the body
of his/her email that isn't answered in those guidelines, I don't
personalize the cut-and-pasted form-letter guidelines at all.  Our
guidelines are *very thorough*, meaning they take longer than the average
MTV-attention-span to read.  If we receive a submission from someone who
has not been sent a copy of the guidelines, we do not accept it (every
request for guidelines is saved and checked with every submission).  If
we receive a submission that is not formatted according to the guidelines
(we specifically request ASCII text for email submissions, many people
send us attatchments or formatted files), we do not accept it.  This
process, in the 14 months I have been associated with the magazine, has
simplified my life considerably, and also guaranteed a high quality of
submissions.  If any of you out there are considering accepting email
submissions, please contact me to discuss these topics further.

One of the essential tools of the publisher ought to be a cheap

materials at the same time.

From a slightly different direction, I have noticed something very
informative in the discussion of cover letters.

As in everything else in the world, every editor is different. Every
journal is different. These differences are often not at all obvious to
the average reader - even to the average subscriber.

A "working poet" is probably submitting to 50 or 60 journals a year,
maybe more. Editors, many of you probably submit as many pieces
yourselves. How realistic is it to compose personalized letters, year in
and year out, based on what one infers about a journal? How accurate can
such inferences even be?

Having been at this game for a while, it is really hard for me to say, in
many cases, what distinguishes the aesthetics of one editor from another,
& especially considering the frequent presence of a large but regular
group of contributors to many journals -- & when a journal's been in
print for a while -- how do you tailor a personalized comment to JOURNAL
A that is different from JOURNAL B and different from JOURNAL C, all of
whom *usually* have a certain percantage of work one resonates with, and
a certain percentage one doesn't...

Models such as those suggested by many of the erstwhile editors on this
list are certainly useful; yet in every case I am able to think of
examples of editors reacting violently to just such strategies - unnamed
folks on this list, for example, Rebecca (not you, but you mentioned this
strategy in your message), who have returned cover letters containing
brief lists of recent publications with roughly scrawled, "do not EVER
include lists like this in letters!"

what was there in the one copy of the journal i had in hand -- paid for
directly to the editor in fact, well prior to submitting -- from which i
could infer such restrictions (said journal, in fact, among the ones I
enjoyed most that year).

the moral i take from this: as always, writers should try to be as
sensitive as possible to the editorial environment they are submitting
to; at the same time editors should realize that submitters often can't
provide the kind of personalized comments they'd like -- & to let the
lack of such (or even subtle mis-steps) get in the way of reading
submitted work is disturbing too...

-- said as a pretty regularly subscribing submitter!

this is a curious thread
someone wanted advice about what to say on a cover letter
editors chimed in with their feelings about
getting how-ever-many seemingly-clueless submissions

i find the whole
"no simultaneous submissions" mambo
rather confusing myself
i edit a magazine and i don't care about that
but i know there are those out there who do

why?

it's only come up once since i started doing this stuff
and i told the poet i didn't care either way
but that if i'd already said i was going to publish
something that it wd depend on where i was
in the process - that i might
or might not still use the piece(s)

i guess it is nice to know if it's multi-submitted

it seems like everyone
has received some obnoxious cover letters
my favorite (bad) cover letter
included the following bit of information
"(so and so) has said that [the poet]
 is the most published experimental
 poet of all time"

wow!    [no S.A.S.E. either---that's power!]

maybe all work should be submitted
without a name on it
with no cover letter
with just an anonymous email address
and/or a postcard to an address
with no name
(preferably not the poet's)

editors cd give confirmation numbers
so that poets cd claim their contributor's
copies without revealing their identity

further perhaps submissions cd
be thunk out a bit more
and rather than being 3-5 poems
with the attendant crapola
they cd become a bit more mail-artish
cd become "chain submissions"
wherein the envelop wd contain
enough postage to travel
to 4-5 more magazines
and their addresses included
on stickers and postage
provided so that if the paris review
didnt want them they cd be immediately
rerouted to lost and found times

So Much For Ghosts


I am Nikuko.  Please, describe yourself.

I am Azure, and I am trying to find out who you are, why you are here. You
are not quite here. Are you.

Is it because I am there I am not quite there are me that you came naked
and broken to me?

I came fully prepared, thank you. You are the one naked and broken. You
you you.

Why do you say that?

Because I want to move you out of here out of my life. And because I am
tired of irreality, tired of ghosts, tired of others, tired of faked
hauntings.

Does it bother you that you want to move me out of there out of your life
and because you are tired of irreality tired of ghosts tired of others
tired of faked hauntings?

No, but it should bother you, you are too limited to live, you don't.

When did you first know that it should bother me I am too limited to live
I do not?

At the very beginning. When I needed to clear a space. When I needed the
empathy of all things. When I searched for mono no aware.

What happened when you needed to clear a space when you needed the empathy
of all things when you searched for mono no aware?

I wanted to rid myself of you like I would rid myself of a fever, such I
will do, such is being done.

Earlier you said I am there I am not quite there are me?

You are not there. I am tired of machines. I am very tired of machines.

You have your mind on machines, it seems.

Yes. Machines have only couplings, concatenations; life has linkages, ef-
fects up and down the chain. Such as it is, paradoxically. Because necess-
ity with the machinic is built-in; necessity among lives is a matter of
entailment, local teleologies.

You think too much about machines.

So that a coupling can break without loss, absolution, recompense. But an
organism, that is something else again.

Is the fact that a coupling can break without loss absolution recompense
but an organism that is something else again the real reason?

Your questions betray this; they are precisely of the order of couplings,
not linkage; they have no _claim._

Maybe and now I adjust my panties - your desires have to do with some girl
related to this.

Exactly. Desires are a form of entailment, and Alan is writing me into
this, as if some girl, but not some girl, but me, Azure, and the linkage
is as strong as any rings.

I don't understand and oh I want to.

There are numerous orders, machinic, cyber-prosthetic, real-organic; there
are couplings and linkages. I am linked; I have come to separate coup-
lings, insofar as they are machinic, that is, concatenations without ties
or bindings among their elements.

Does the fact that is concatenations without ties or bindings among their
elements explain anything else?

That I am a marauder, that I am Azure, although I am also known by other
names, all of them real - that I am here to fight among and against the
regimen of ghosts.

Are you sure you are a marauder that you are azure although you are also
known by other names all of them real that you are there to fight among
and against the regimen of ghosts?

I am positive; your question is nothing more than repetition.

You mentioned that you want to move me out of there out of your life and
because you are tired of irreality tired of ghosts tired of others tired
of faked hauntings?

It was more than a mention; it is an impetus, an imperative.

Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?

It is something that the human has always gone through, waged against the
symbolic.

Is it because the human has always gone through waged against the symbolic
that you came naked and broken to me?

You repeat; I will bring this to an end; it is you who are naked and
broken...

[...]

( I won't tell you what Nikuko said any more! says Azure. So much for
ghosts! )

Hey -- you got the wrong guy. Bill (that's Bill Luoma, yall) was really
only reporting on Bob's talk, not shouting "Pile on!" a la the Segue
panel collected in the Impercipient Lecture Series. Bob was actually
presenting those "bland sentences" as "bland sentences". I think he went
so far as to call that kind of description of the complex experience of a
poem "a betrayal." There may have been some anti-Bob vibe at the
conference, but nobody sent it my direction.

Again, that may be, but this seemed to be the subtext of Bob's talk --
that those annotations are never more than freeze-dried, whereas in grad
school (at the undergrad level too!) it's possible to get the (bad) idea
that those annotations are the aim of study.

Doubtless. Nevertheless as this was a conference on poetry and pedagogy
the default mode was that a poem is experiential, and that the classroom
is only one of the places where learning is prepared. You know, zones of
proximal delay; one is just as likely to put ideas together in downtime,
or out arguing with other practitioners, other learners, jargon yay! I
think it was Bob and Michael Davidson who both made the case for
extramural discussion, Al Filreis arguing in parallel for the use of
classroom/organization listservs, Caroline Bergvall on a complementary
wave updating the peripatetics by putting walkmans on their ears.

Certainly! But I think you are defending Bob's case when no one has filed
an action--not this time, eh?

All best,

re: Bob's talk at Bard

Bob was complaining about these things; not arguing for them. I thought
actually that Bill was loving Bob too much by quoting him so much. But I
guess he isn't a NYer.


re: Joe Safdie's post

The person that John mentioned was a graduate student not a professor;
was not droning on about meaning but rather was concerned about what he
perceived as meaninglessness in a Tardos poem (he felt it was not a
poem); and when Bernadette asked if he was rich he had just
contextualized himself as being from Singapore yet being Chinese.

In reply to Jamie Perez's question about Sound Poetry: 'is there any useful
distinction between Sound Poetry and either Scat or just plain Vocal Music?'

I would suggest that checking out Richard Kostelanetz's Introduction to
_Text-Sound Texts_ would help. Kostelanetz suggests that his new term (or
Sound Poetry) deliberately eschews melody, etc, which would take it over
into music. But I don't think he would deny, & certainly I don't, that many
sound poets have learned a lot from scat singing, not to mention other
aspects of jazz...

no, i don't think i took any shots at bob and pot was not involved among the
two of us (tho he did pull out a bottle of jamesons for which i was very
grateful).

i reserve my tomatoes for special occasions. one such occasion may have been
the marginalization of poetry talk at segue a few years ago where some of us
wore free bob perelman stickers.  although, now that i think about it, that
wasn't a tomato.  it was a kiss.

i thought i was explaining his talk a bit, how those quotes are something to
be wary of if you're a teacher, not really a conference problem according to
him, but a classroom one.

yes, i agree.  i was hoping not to get credit for starting some divisive
thing.  i don't think i can prove that i wasn't, but the following "fact"
might work in my favor:  Joan Retallack, the head thinker behind the bard
conference, back snorkelled that i was giving too much attention to bob,
being too honnoriffic of him, when there were other talkers who maybe
deserved some spot light as well.  such as caroline bergval's flaneur wearing
walkman talk ("what you see does not correspond to what you hear"), and jena
osman's academic as detective paper ("it's a career"), which was also a
feature in her reading so there was a nice backdraft there. also it now seems
to me that i could have discussed caroline's and jena's peices to illustrate
some notions of randomness, which was what i took to be the theme of my post.


on another note, i was crushed to learn that taylor brady had, elsewhere,
performed the part of jena's detective better than i.  and this after robert
("a word is anything that can be erased") kelly axed me if i had ever had
acting lessons.  o jena, i have proclaimed my love for you countless times
and yet continue to be spurned.  taylor, what is your secret?

re Unsolicited Mss Letters, actually. the retro action of the editors
strikes me as too hearty. because admit it, the rules are fluid and let us
even say arbitrary. I see no reason to kvetch (that's how it sounded in
Massachusetts) as to how writers, you know, *submit*. editing a poem mag is
a job, maybe not remunerative but you weren't expecting that anyway. I
shouldn't say this but I've given money (small amounts, when I was a Have)
to a few mags and even a press, beyond the books I bought. it wasn't because
I thought the editors were hassled by what looks to me like normal
work-related petty hassles. I just thought these little, micro publishing
ventures, these pushes against the wall, needed support. I know publishing
aint easy, especially on PoBiz budgets, but eds and pubs have the control.
that a poet submitting might be a little or a lot disconnected could be
taken into account. I was about to sound an advisory note (use the force
wisely Luke) but screw it, I'm probably pissing people off concerning this
apparently important issue. I second David Golumbia's words:  "to let the
lack of such (or even subtle mis-steps) get in the way of reading submitted
work is disturbing too...". I didn't check my horoscope to see if I should
be making public statements today, so maybe I'm out of line here. if so:
sorry. Allen Bramhall

in line, with lines, eager as
a line of inquiry, solid
with lines of reasoning. nothing
needs adjustment
more than that picture. not of Steve,

gang getting their senses ripped and

respect. Emily

changes her text. hyper text, you
must realize, tho she
preceded that term and
wrote her own. the words are changed,
oddly enough, to
their relief. why would Steve Benson
arise in this collection
of words? why isn't Ted Berrigan
stomping around somewhere?
explain things to those
who talk a lot. the
romantic texture
finds its soul mate. lovely
to stick needles in with

david golumbia had some good things to say
about this business

just before his posting i read Hannah J Sassaman's
and felt pretty squeamish about it

while i don't wish to come off as suggesting that
there even ought to be across-the-board protocols

i find the hoop jumping approach sorta sadistic

i mean as editors what do we think is more important
publishing good poetry
  or
publishing subscribers or
"careful-readers" of ourselves ?

i somehow had the impression
that those "poetry societies" wherein
anyone can for $50 or something
join and then be sure
that at least one of their poems
will appear in a big-ass
(high school yearbook-lookin') annual
---were generally considered
to be bunk

further -

how much is it reasonable
to ask of *everyone*
who might submit to your magazine ?

is it really that big a deal
to get published by you or me
that either of us ought to be able
 to proscribe
a course of action
preliminary to some
anonymous poet's sending
us a few poems in the mail ?

isn't it enough of hurdle
that editorial tastes are
inconstant, decidely fickle ?

submission guidelines : 1st of all you must be a subscriber who paid either

If anyone out there happens to know of any info (online or otherwise)
regarding the Czech historian Zavis Kalandra, it would be much appreciated.
(All we know thus far is that he was apparently hanged w/ Milada Horakova, a

1. perhaps the publishers/editors of above magazines should form a

Billy, most interesting post, as usual, but let's not forget, lest we
get too nostalgic, that WCW was anti-semitic in a rather robust way,
no less than Ezra and T.S.-- a fact, of course, that does not make
him any less "quintessentially american" than Charles Lindbergh,
Richard Nixon, or Jack Spicer. Or that his response to the bombing
of Hiroshima was something to the effect of, "ah, the japs, now we'll
have to feel sorry for them."

None of which may mean much in our evaluation of his poetry (though
that's a contended question, I know).

My memory on the WCW quote re: Hiroshima was way off. Here it

                Speaking of Hiroshima, here is one of the masters, William
                  Carlos Williams, in a letter to another poet, Byron
                  Vazakas, dated August 7, 1945: "The day following
                  the atomic blast! -- the poor Jews who accomplished
                  it. Now we'll hate them worse than ever."

I don't like it because we once had chosen a piece, notified
the author of our intentions, and just as we were putting the
issue together, someone--who luckily knew what we were
planning to publish--saw the exact piece in another journal.
without having been told by the author (though I hope we
would have been when we came to sending out the formal
contract) we wasted some time, and very nearly would have
wasted a certain amount of money on production. our
guidelines are clear that we don't accept simultaneous
submissions, and this person was rather well published so I
found it quite insensitive that he had done that. I return
mss. immediately when I read that it is a simultaneous
submission: I feel there is no sense spending the time to
read it if you are from the start possibly competing with
another publication to secure the rights. Usually, its no
loss anyways.

As for what comes in a cover or with a cover letter, I don't
pay much attention to and its not too painful to recycle the
superfluous paper. My big peeve is that the majority of U.S.
submissions come with U.S. stamps on the SASE. Unfortunately,
the Canadian post office does not recognize those stamps as
they have not received any $$ from the purchase of such
stamps. I sincerely doubt any Canadian journals return mss.
with American postage. I have learned that many postal
services in the States don't even know what an International
Reply Coupon is, so it is difficult to include them for
return of one's work but we are quite happy to receive coins
taped to the envelopes or dollar bills hidden inside.

So that's my two cents, though it may not go far on that side
of the border. :)

Here's a partial list of what's on Mappings, my (ostensibly) new music

Bruce Andrews, Steve Benson (with Splatter Trio), Kamau Brathwaite, Robert
Duncan (song setting of Up Rising from Passages by composer Lou Harrison),
Barbara Guest, Susan Howe, Jackson Mac Low, Chris Mann, Steve McCaffery,
Gertrude Stein (setting of Preciosilla by composer Eve Beglarian), Catriona
Strang (with Francois Houle) and lots more. While many of the tracks are
from readily available sources, I'd be surprised if most folks had

Whoops - sorry Bill (and Juliana, Jordan, et al) - I misread in haste I
guess, and then knee-jerked.  So, please disregard the "pot shot" portion
of my message but not the "Philly" part.  As for those boring sentences on
Stein, Wiliams, Loy, etc - it's still sort of (sort of) interesting to me
that I don't find anyting particularly wrong with them in terms of content
but only in the fact of their isolation and with the fact that, perhaps?,
they are meant to stand in for the whole.  But in highlighting them as
tedious representations Bob also recalled to me (by way of Bill) some
pretty interesting long conversations, particularly about Loy -- the mind
fills in the gaps.    -m.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Kent's recent stipulation that "WCW was anti-semitic in a rather robust
way, no less than Ezra and T.S." is a real distortion - one loses all
sense of particulars when one implies that Williams, Pound and Eliot are
alike on this regard - and the inability to draw distinctions is a cousin
to the inability to act.  I would suggest reading Williams's very complex
story "A Face of Stone."  What Paul Mariani points out in his biography of
Williams seems basically true:

"Despite accusations to the contrary, Williams was no anti-Semite.  He
worked all his life closely with Jewish writers, from Kreyborg and
Bodenheim and Mina Loy to Zukofsky and West and Moss and Kamin and Sol
Funaroff and later with Shapiro and Ignatow and Sidney Salt and Ginsberg
and Levertov and any number of others.  He was, unquestionably, a product
of his times and he did use the old comic-strip vulgarisms, allowing such
words as kike, nigger, wop, jap, frog, Polack and the rest of it to
infiltrate his speech and his letters.  Nor did he always escape the
poular racial myths of his time."

As someone currently writing about WCW's relationship to African-American
culture, I'm senstive to the vexed nature of his approach to race - trust
me.  But to simply call him anti-semitic or racist is to in fact say
nothing at all.  Among other things, one ends up missing the crucial fact
of how the speech of ethnic minorities mediated Williams poetry: as in his
famous characterization of his poetry as coming "out of the mouths of
Polish mothers."  Just who were these Polish mothers, do you think?  I'd
suggest that, like the Polish woman in "A Face of Stone," they were Jews.

Likewise, the quote by Williams on Hiroshima which Kent had misremembered,
"The day following the atomic blast! -- the poor Jews who accomplished it.
Now we'll hate them worse than ever," seems to me bitterly ironic, fairly
complex and, in any event, worth more than a rubber stamped condemnation.

Hello. It seems that often comments made in this venue are all too quickly
divorced from their pragmatic source, ie:

Some guy (I think guy) asked what should be in a cover letter. The question
is one that implies a degree of ignorance of  the appropriate contents of a
cover letter, and a desire to know more.

Being an editor of a magazine who is often asked that very question,
presumably with quite direct results attached to my response, Iresponded
pragmatically, in such a way that might attempt to guide the querent toward
what I consider, in my editorial high-chair, to be the favored method of
writing a cover letter. This is because, being an editor, I am an
opinionated so-and-so. If someone asked you, a restaurant critic, say, how
you liked your portobello mushroom, you'd probably waste no time in
attempting to describe the degree of tenderness required for your pleasure.

 Fence does not allow --or at least inasmuch as is possible--annoying cover
letters to color our response to the actual poems submitted. But that
doesn't mean we don't find them annoying and wish they could be amended.
Amendment is the editor's dream. We wish to amend the whole wide world.

A different question is: "Why do editors get so testy about submissions
submitted in ways they do not admire?"

I would submit that this testiness is a hazard of the job, ie, we are
unpaid laborers and cannot help but feel cranky and/or testy.

Please send portobello mushrooms with your submissions

A good hat goes a long way -- possible I cribbed that bit of my "method"
from one of the pieces in your "Works and Days"? Also, channeling John
Lurie's voiceover on John Zorn's "Spillane" doesn't hurt.

Yes, this is more of what I was getting at (to simul-answer )L's reply)

Was trying to get at why this term ever came to be in the first place.
Were the "sound poets" trying to distinguish what they were doing from
music and why? etc.

Though saying its not music because it eschews melody is pretty weak,
don't you think? Or just plain ignorant of a lot of things music is
doing/has done? (melody re Cage? re Ambient Techno? re purely percussive
genres? re anybody who sings "badly" on purpose? re alotta' stuff)

Then again, I'm completely ignorant of what RK has to say in creating
the term and will look into it some day. I'm just trying to figure out
the usefulness of the distinction as in what is being set apart and why.

hello poetics,

my name is Ana Doina, I've been on and off this
list for quiet some time and enjoyed the flow mostly
on a lurker's mode, but because I've been submitting
lately I feel I should get into the conversation

about multiple - I agree that once a poem is being
published by a mag that asks for previously un-published
material the poem should be withdrawn from all other mags
that might want to publish it, if they suggest so. But...
consider this: poems are sent in January to mag X who does not
uses the SASE provided to accept or refuse the poem, although
they give as response time 4-6 weeks (and unfortunately not
many mags do give any time-frame)
Meanwhile around June, tired of waiting and depressed, considering
the silence as a rejection, the poet sends the same poems to mag Y
and gets a positive response for a future publication.
Then, by the following January a letter and two mags come
in the mailbox, the letter form mag X accepting the poems,
Mag X with the poem, and mag Y with the same poem.
uhh.... was that to be considered a simultaneous submission?

More times than I care to count I have sent submissions with sase,
with or without cover letter, as close to the guidelines as I could
or understood them, and didn't ever (for some this means years) receive
an answer. I don't want my writings to be kept captive, I need them to
circulate. How else am I going to let anyone know that I exist,
let alone write?
Unfortunately some mags find themselves in the position to publish
a poem simultaneously with an other mag because the latter did not
follow through its own rules, but I fail to see how that is the fault
of the writer.

best,
Ana D

If you're a cigarette smoker, you're in luck -- smoke o.k., cat o.k.
You'll be sharing apt. (NOT your own big bedroom) with a young British

While the sublet is officially over on Sep. 31, there's a chance that the

Hi Bill & all:

wanted to clarify if that's possible, and to add some thoughts about the
Bard
symposium. To witness that fact that, though it's been clarified, Bill
wasn't
taking a pot shot at Perelman. Bill responded
> i thought i was explaining his talk a bit, how those quotes are something
to
> be wary of if you're a teacher, not really a conference problem according
to
> him, but a classroom one.
My take: Perelman was presenting a disturbingly amusing list of the sorts of
things
teachers might say to make "difficult texts" more digestable (or at least
palatable
-- which concern did arise, it should be noted, as a focus of the
symposium).
This in a way to warn against *oversimplifying* which further obscures
texts, or
anyway simply inserts a made-for-t.v. frame around them, cliffnotifies them.


One question I had wanted to ask Bob but didn't get a chance to:  was he
also saying
that the lit crit industry has too much influence over how we talk about
poems (in
classrooms) and if so, what can we (as poets and teachers) do about it?   It
strikes me
that such critical soundbites are the babies of New Criticism -- though they
reach
"outside" the poem (centripodal-petal?) they reach only to a limited number
of
"approved" discourses to align the poem with those discourses rather than to
"elucidate"
poems.

But while I address this question I have to grapple with the lexicon that
the situation
assumes: that of making "difficult" texts "easier" as a way of making them
"teachable,"
a notion which sees the classroom as a way to disseminate other poetics and
poetries --
however to what "end" is unclear.  It was decided, half dryly, that we were
talking at the
symposium about "the New Poetries."  I wryly added that what was needed was
a teaching
anthology _Understanding New Poetries_ -- but this did seem in part what was
wanted, a
new cannon complete with its own secondary sources -- that is, that the
sorts of collaborative
investigation we were having *could* strive toward curricular ends.   This
is exactly what
Lynn Keller's paper did (Bill's dialogue with Lynn afterwards would seem to
corroborate
this), and I agree tangentially with Bill's assertion that another binary
(centripetal-podal/
centrifugal) "isn't interesting," i.e. that is ultimately limited as a
critical tool (see Bill's recent
essay on gender in the current _Shark_ for iteresting critical vectors) but
it seems useful as a
pedagogical tool, i.e. that teaching such oppositional models gives students
something to think
about/against.  I'm not all that experienced as a teacher, but when as a
student of Modernism
especially it helped me significantly. I taught a creative writing class
looking at models of
production starting with Aristotle, and along a continuum (or in a larger
set of ideas) such
binary models break down, and things that looked opposed start to resemble
eachother.
The x/y model stands in for a moment and frames the situation as a way to
make it for that
moment clear (I'm reminded again that Bill's gender essay had x's and y's in
it, all pointing
this way and that).  But as Bill said, it was one of the few pedagogical
moments, and I'm
thankful Lynn took the opportunity to open up her model to response and
criticism.

Also wanted to add that I did attend the working groups most
enthusiastically, in part
because other enthusiastic members stuck it out, and our leader Thalia (? -
sorry, blanking)
was super and enthusiastic, and provided exercises/ideas/hands on for
dealing with
"difficult" texts without roping them into a simplistic schema.  For
example, with Retallack's
_Icarus Fffffalling_, we in groups of 4-5, decided how we would preform a
page, which
turned out to be a multivocal reading of the page, and we found that there
were many
different ways to read the page, both spinning out and spinning in . . .

It was an intense weekend.  3 square meals a day (excellent food, plenty of
vegetarian
fare, bottles of wine at the dinner table, dessert at lunch even) + snacks
and a beer& wine
reception after the evening event (+chocolate covered strawberries!).  And
these were all
very social.  One got the sense that the organizers wanted to get people
next to eachother
constantly, in different configurations, with food and/or wine (if after 5
pm), to continue the
collaborative investigation. One had to make space to sneak into the woods
or to the waterfall,
or to check out all the amazing buildings on the grounds, or to gaze out
over the Hudson River
Valley at some point, and with not much sleep (there was so much wine at the
receptions that I
think we were meant to spirit away a few bottles and continue after hours),
this did lead to burn
out & by sunday afternoon we'd fizzled to about 50 or so, down from about
120 or so (?).

As with Bill, I'd say all the readings were super. I don't know what it was,
but everyone was super.
Maybe I was feeling well-fed, well-liked and generous, and so let go some of
my critical edge.
But I really do think it was super, that Joan et al. assembled a super bunch
of people (all well-fed,
well-liked and generous) -- and gave them enough time, and comfortable
spaces, and food,
and wine, and a beautiful setting . . .

We were pampered.  And so Juliana's response ("I want to put a word in for
placelessness . . .")
to Al Filreis & the Kelly Writer's House presenters (which was itself,
earlier fashioned as a
response to Bill's question to Bob Perelman (as I recall, how do we make
poetic events possible?
How do we get people together for poetry?) -- hit home.  Why can't we have a
waterfall at Buffalo
where we can all sneak off to at 6 a.m. and go skinnydipping (right before
the flyfishermen show up)?
I'd like to hear more about where Juliana was going with that, with the
notions of textual spaces vs.
actual spaces.  I think she was trying to de-heirachize, to say that it's
not necessarily "better" to have
the space (the endowment to establish the space, which i think was something
like $40,000), but best
to make the spaces possible, whichever way.  That our models of poetic
production shouldn't so
closely resemble/rely on capitalistic models of production (more place, more
voice!  more materials,
more production!). (All this as my heart goes out to the groundhog who finds
himself lost on the
concrete slab of a plaza outside the library where I'm typing this.  A
little girl wants to feed him
cheetos.)  I'm all ears.

thanks & best,
Linda

On another list I have mentioned that a cheap shredder is an essential tool
for publishers--not for manuscripts (except those that come without SASE),
but for front matter. Turns all that paper into cheap packing material. I
find all the self-hyping annoying, but it doesn't get between me and the
poems. Except for the occasional "so-and-so recommended I send you this"
when so-and-so is a poet I have published or simply admire, which can be
useful.

As to a larger annoyance, ianppropriate submissions, there seems to be no
way to lay out one's prefernces so clearly as to avoid them. Let me be
clear what I mean. I think all of us have tastes that are individual enough
that very little of the unsolicited will be right for us. But a lot is on
another planet--the church ladies writing in rhymed couplets who think that
they fall into the category of unconventional because their take on god
would raise Calvin's hackles, the high school poets, the folks writing
lineated prose memoirs. But none of that concerns this group.

On the recent flurry of posts regarding submission
guidelines/steamblowing/reactions:

I am reminded of my days as a chef, when on the kitchen side of the doors
we would mumble, "This job would be great if it wasn't for all the customers".

I also remember my great Uncle Peck telling me stories of growing up in
Montana where for fun they would take two cats, tie one end of a rope to
each tail, then hang the cats by the middle of the rope over a branch to
watch the fight than ensued.

As is often the case, there is a thesis and an antithesis, and I suspect
the truth may lie somewhere inbetween.

Having more submitters than subscribers is absurd.

Expecting every submission to come it "just so" is equally absurd.

It all comes down to what is reasonable.

Is it reasonable for a Canadian publisher to expect an American SASE to
have IRC's?  Yes.
Is it reasonable for a publisher who accepts electronic submissions to
stipulate ASCII plaintext included in the body of the email?  Yes.
Is it reasonable for a publisher who's mission statement reads something
like, "We endeavor to publish the unorthdox, the uncategorizable, the kinds
of work that no mainstream publisher would touch", to have submission
guidelines like, "Query with sample chapters and a plot synopsis"?  No.
Is it reasonable for a submitter to expect editorial feedback along with a
rejection?  No.
Is it reasonable for a publisher to have submission guidelines?  Yes.
Is it reasonable for a publisher to expect submitters to have familiarized
themselves with those guidelines?  Yes.
Is it reasonable to expect a publisher to publish something because the
submitter has followed the guidelines precisely?  No.
Is it reasonable to reject a piece of work soley because it did not conform
to the submission guidelines?  No.

You get the gist.

I wish more submitters would spend more time targeting their submissions.
It would make turn around times that much faster for those of us who do.
Will it happen?  No, of course not.  There will always be knuckleheads
and/or chuckleheads out there who go the Kilgore Trout route, scribble and
send and come what may.

Note to publishers--Waber's Maxim #1:  If there is something that you can't
change, find a way to make it work to your advantage.  With all the
rejection letters I have received (please, God, let someone backchannel me
that it doesn't make a bad human being to have received rejection letters),
I have never onced received--with the rejection letter--a subscription
form, or a book list.  Granted, I could and should get these things on my
own, but, the fact of the matter is that by the very act of submitting I
have identified myself as an excellent prospect for subscription or
purchasing.  By being rejected with no specific explanation, I am probably
even more inclined to want to read the kinds of things that get accepted.
That makes me targeted and motivated, and folks, it just don't get any
better than that.  I'm not saying that every rejection is a certain
customer, but, I do think it's a huge missed opportunity for immediate
sales.  Barring that, how about the mailing list?  Constant communication
with a highly targeted mailing list is crucial for any small business.  How
much more highly targeted can the list generated from submissions be?  Have
I ever been added to a mailing list as a result of a submission?  Nope.

Note to submitters--Publishers do not have something that they are trying
to jam down your throats.  They have something you want, and it's your job
to get it from them.  If that means taking some time to find out how they
like to see things presented, then I say that's time well spent.  With all
the impersonalization that comes from form letters and submission
guidelines, it's easy to forget that in the end you are sending a letter
from one living breathing sometimes happy sometimes stressed person to
another living breathing sometimes happy sometimes stressed person.

Those lovely white chickens come home to roost. Unfortunately if one is in
a minority in this country (could be worse--it's not Bosnia) one grits
one's teeth a lot. There's still a lot of unthinking antisemitism
around--there are even a few restricted communities left.

I'm going to have to throw my vote against any standard. I personally
take a great deal of pleasure in reading the variety of cover letters
we receive and I think people should feel free to include any
information about themselves they deem relevant as an introduction to
someone they may have never met. In the end, they have very little
significance and are just that, an introduction, a postal
how-do-you-do. I think there's a correlation between the length of the
cover letter and whether or not the writer knows one of the editors
personally or not--and that's perhaps the real issue to consider in how
journal publications seem to operate. My favorite letters, however, are
the ones we've received after rejecting writers that inform us of the
incredible errors in judgment we've made. It was a new sub-genre of the
letter I never knew existed before. Peter melodeon poetry

[resend: my address book was messed up and sending my mail to the
listserv itself...sorry to administrators, don't know how long I've been
doing that]

Anybody know of anything worth reading written about _Defoe_ (Scalapino,
97?). I read it back then and have dabbled in reading sections of it
here and there ever since. Would be interested in what others have had
to say about it.

My random thought about it: I think Ah-Ha's video "Take on Me," is an
important text for reading this book. Somewhat tongue in cheek, somewhat
serious. I suppose that's a rather pro-active reading though...

A romp through the Poetics Archive gives a little fun reading on the
subject, but not enough.

I agree with what's below - I like the cover letters.  Besides, isn't this
sense of "I judge based only on what's on the page" a little retrograde?
Of course, with COMBO I've avoided alot of this hoo-ha by deciding that
our unsolicited contributors will come only from the ranks of those
familiar with the mag (which I give away for free if necessary to avoid
any sense of exclusion).  But in the end, is any of this really such a big
deal? I also like contributors notes - if you like a poem you read, it's
nice to at least be able to flip and find out what city that poet lives in
or some other places they've published, whether they have a book, etc.
And may it goes a little way toward making sure we don't fetishize these
things called poems, eh?    -m.

looks like the horse has only been knocked senseless, so may I proffer the
image of Ted Berrigan, for example, confronted by cover letters. my surmise:
he would not take a narrow view of those words, and would read them for
whatever ore he was inspired to find. okay, maybe you're not looking for
bauxite today, but maybe someday... at any rate, there are people (I assume)
at both ends of the submissions, and it's poetry in the middle, right? one
morning after a heavy snowfall I rose early, shovelled at the home base, ran
10 miles to work (part of my idiom then), helped the building manager shovel
out because it was a big job, and when my co-workers arrived they complained
about the difficult drive to work. what do you know, I found satisfaction in
my circumstance and they found none in theirs. I don't wear editor shoes but
if I did I'm guessing I would learn to love even those cover letters, or I'd
join the foreign legion. either way, I would continue to find poetry
interesting and to find interesting poetry. AHB

        Yeah, why do it at all if the whole wide world weren't at stake?  I hear
you there.
        Anecdote upon anecdote:  I was receiving submissions without a cover
letter, and sometimes without a letter or an SASE.  My first thought was,
what am I expected to do with these poems?  No SASE, I immediately threw
them out.  No cover letter, I sent them back unread, no letter of
explanation.  Kenning doesn't print contributors notes, thus I really
haven't a use for publication / bio in a letter, EXCEPT
        insofar as these things merge with whatever sort of request a submiter (or
"contributor") is making.  After all, it is always, even in the case of
solicited material, a request of someone's time and attention to submit
work.  I think it is key to include a cover letter of some sort, at least
indicating that the work is coming with the intention of entering into
conversation with the editor and her/his publication/press.  Thus, it is a
bit ridiculous to send to a publication/press with which one is unfamiliar.
 If it were only a matter of making the work available, the most direct and
often most efficacious way to do this is to publish it yourself.
        With Kenning, the editorial focus (which is made as explicit as possible
by means of occassional "editor's note"s) presupposes that I read
unsolicited mss as well as solicited mss with an equal emphasis.  They
would all wind up in the same place.
        Another key way to enter into conversation with editors / publications is
to purchase and read them.

Michael:

More later, but for now just to point out that this quote from
Mariani is rather pathetic as a "defense." Pound had strong
relationships with Jewish writers too. One can be subject to "the
popular racial myths of his time" and still have lots of
chummy relationships with the subaltern other! (Remember Yugoslavia?)

And as for those "comic-strip vulgarisms" (the Jewish kids in
Brooklyn ate those comics right up, didn't they?) that suffuse WCW's
letters, does Mariani imply that _everyone_ was using them? Of course
WCW was a "product of his time" as are we all, and of course he's a
"complex" figure. But choices can still be made, and one is not
condemned (especially one whose self-proclaimed task is to cleanse
the language!) to topple headlong into the most hateful vocabulary.
Mariani's little quote is quite simply apologetic slop of the
hero-worshipping kind.

And as for your reading of the "irony" in Williams's remark about the
Jews and the Bomb, I doubt it. "Kike" pops up like dandelions in
May in his letters and little irony is apparent. Be careful here.
It's one thing to misread comments about ready-made classroom phrases
that Language poets use; this is something of a more serious kind.

thanx carol, for all the detail and such - but i still find that i'm not
very clear about some things in this - i take it that the capilano review
"secures 1st time rights" or something like that ? you don't have permanent
rights to it do you ?

what strikes me as very strange, relative to how i think about it, is that i
can't imagine *why* i wd care that something i'd published or was going to
publish had appeared in some other locale or was to do so... - but then to
learn that at least part of the problem is also that some editors (i'm
extrapolating from you carol) feel that magazines are competing, presumable
~to win~ something, ie, "the rights"

i wonder how many publishers of mags (on this list fer instance) feel this
way ? or more specifically - how many after publishing, have "the rights" ?
and is it seen as some sort of investment ? - i'm imagining that the hope
runs something like this "when X is as famous as john ashbery, and they
wanna do a _selected_ i'll get my payback then for this not too profitable
publishing"

somewhere i'd heard about all this stuff but i had the impression that it
only held true for things like parnassus or the paris review - i guess
everybody's just doing what they feel the need for - but for all you editors
out there i'd like to note : i'm not competing with you and i don't feel,
nor can i see how yr competing with me

(ok, except maybe the paris review, whose ass i'm gonna wup next time i see
it)

Very glad to see Michael Magee's eloquent post on this subject.  I was
about to write something along similar lines myelf, but probably wouldn't
have done as well.  To class Williams alongside Pound as an anti-semite
seems to me ridiculous, and totally unsupported by the facts, at least as
I've come across them in my reading of, and about, Williams.  I would also
second Michael's reading of the Williams Hiroshima quote:  it seems to me
to be *about* anti-Semitism, not an expression of it.  And just to add to
the record a bit, it's worth remembering a couple of things.  One is that
Williams was, at least at times, inclined to *identify* himself as Jewish,
much to his family's consternation.  Another is that he got pissed as hell
at Pound over the latter's growing fascism and anti-Semitism during the
thirties, and said so.  I'm not trying to say he was perfect--he certainly
wasn't.  But his situation was a lot more complex, and interesting, than
Kent Johnson's comments on the subject would suggest.

as a post to the post-conversation. (And as a Jew, so no apologies from
this end)
What is the "best" piece of writing you all believe is Anti Semitic?

novels?
poetry?
Plays?

i.e. Cantos
Williams, per
this conversation.


Wondering what the "list" thinks. (Black-List?)

Alert: Wonky post...

The Bard conference on poetry and pedagogy interestingly
suggested to me, afterwards, the question of differing pedagogical
styles of the various institutions in which poets, theoreticians and
scholars have trained, and are training, as teachers.

I think a "bar" is an institution if it supports a poetry scene. That
is I mean to question at the outset whether an institution has to be
by definition an academic one. Rob Manery and I operated a "landless"
poetry institution in Ottawa for a number of years, to which we
found, for our events, monies and spaces as and where we could.

At the conference nobody mentioned their favorite poetry bar
institution, or actually spoke of the institution as a concept, except
near the end, when Al Filreis initiated a discussion of his own
pedagogy, a discussion directly dependent on the specific situation
at/of Univ. of Penn, and Kelly Writers House, which he was "open"
about, as to funding etc, in a way that no other institutional rep
was. Harryette Mullen directly addressed teaching issues at UCLA;
unfortunately, she had to leave the conference early.

Academic institutions were for the most part represented implicitly
at the conference. Their representation was by no means an agenda
of the conference. The explicit agenda in this regard was, it seemed
to me, to represent some poets as autonomous published
individuals, ready for special hire to spread the word in existing
institutional structures. (I don't mean to suggest that this was the
agenda of the conference as a whole, but only with respect to this
issue I am presenting, after-the-conference -- the issue of the
institution.)

Here I just want to barely even hint at a few things - after my
experiences at the conference - from the vantage-point, and the
question, of institutional affiliation. (Perhaps the word
"institution" is a-buzz in my head because of a discussion on a
listserve the other month, in conjunction with a panel at Writes
House on the same subject -- with Shawn Walker, Josh Schuster,
Al Filreis. Perhaps not.)

Wonky post con't:

Since institutions were for the most part represented implicitly at
the conference, mentioning four of them here, as I want so-briefly
to do (and not more or less of them) is very much the result of
friendships I have with some of the presenters, whose personal
particulars I know, etc. I hope that's ok. That is the subjective side
to choosing the institutions I do. But, there is an objective side as
well -- which is that few participants actually located themselves
institutionally when they addressed the conference topic of how to
teach poetry. Michael Davidson and Page Du Bois, for instance,
gave papers that for some participants became the conference
highlights (e.g., Maz881 mentions Michael Davidson's paper), but
their felt presence at the conference bore no relation to UCSD as
place or program, where they both teach. (On top of that, Maz881,
who not a presenter, was a student of Davidson's at UCSD. I think Du
Bois was introduced as teaching in a classics department, which
helped to redundify, ie explain, the emphases in her paper on
Classics - but, "the classics" is a scholarly category, not an
institutional one per se, except in a metaphorical sense.)

Institutions I personally felt were more or less explicitly
represented at the conference were Bard College itself, Poetics
Program of the State University of New York at Buffalo, Teachers
& Writers, and UPenn. In terms of dollars invested in poetics
programming, I'd speculatively say that Buffalo has made by far
the greatest poetics investment -- ie in student literary production,
which has saturated the various scenes, with all sorts of materials,
for quite some time -- of them all.

I'm just suggesting that pedagogy is a collective style or practice,
and can equally refer to the social dynamics of a poetry scene, as it
can to an English department, or "alternative creative space" funded
by the hipster beebop junkie on 79th St. -- or ad exec. The spirit of
street alcohol, or the spirit of a sour resentiment fahrting from the
ministry of an interior departmental bowel movement, inflamed allover
by regret, envy and nascent intellectual dementia, compounded furthermore
by brain shrinkage and the perverse taking to the wearing of bow
ties, do have pedagogical outcomes.

Having said all this, I don't really want to venture any further on
this subject of a comparison of institutional pedagogies. I just want
to broach it as a question for further discussion; then I'd love to.
Let me just say: I felt them deeply at the conference. Like, "I felt."

Perhaps it would be highly productive to address the question of
"the institution" in this way at another conference, building on the
excellent inaugural work that took place at Bard. To address the
institution without getting hustled by promotional materials and
advertorial jargon for this or that place would be the idea -- with
poetry in the fore of attention. It would be interesting to hear about
the DisEmbodied School of Breathing Nostrils, Kootenay School of
Mountain-Comes-to-You, The Ivy League Drip, Popeye OPOYAZ,
Creative Writers of Angelic Respiring in Mercedes Benzes,
Romantic Materialists' School of Adjunct Engineering in
Germinalist Progressivity, School of Finicky Humanists With Bent
Toward One's Own Wax of Descartes, Proceduralists International
-- Division of Hypertext Incorporated, Subsidiary of MicroDisney,
School of World Dominance in Literary Production Factories of
North American Pressers, AvantGarde TM, and so on.

writing learns to start somewhere: that can't be helped. the word freezes
because of willing passages of time. luckily, when time pulls thru, the rest
of us can reclaim the land. the endless dialogue does things like that.
finally, as in later that week, you'll look to see who spoke. were it that
easy, everyone would crow. now it's only a little bit of night. there might
be a mythology to follow, or squander. no time to look: merely waiting
prepares us. now we have that gadget working; the signal can now be wielded.
everybody spoke. the machine lives.

2) you weren't ready to listen because that's how messages wear out. I'm
talking as a matter of fact. that seems like thriving to me.

3) poetry can be scruffy now, okay?

Just for the record, since this sounds like it's talking about Fence:  We
don't ask for queries or sample chapters or etc.

Since this thread seems to be viable, I'd like to ask a question, a
marketing question:

Mr. Waber proposes that rejection letters ought to be accompanied by a
subscription form or some similar form of encouragement. I think this is a
great idea, and in fact had meant to do just that when starting Fence, but
was voted down by the rest of the Fence people on grounds of "adding insult
to injury," "rubbing salt in the wound," etc. What do y'all think about
this? Would you feel insulted, salted, annoyed, demeaned or otherwise
antagonized by such an enclosure?

I'd really like to know. Because we'd really like to have more subscribers.

Chris and all, I believe there's a book out recently on Williams's Latin
American-ness, isn't there?  Can't remember the author.  And,
interestingly, Williams was evidently part Jewish, as Mariani points out
in his biography (p. 411): "Back in the early 20's, Williams had told
Louis Untermeyer about his Jewish heritage and about his gentle
grandfather Solomon Hoheb.  But by 1937 the family situation had changed
drastically.  His brother Ed had never forgiven him for making his
Jewishness public."

                                and there you
                        have it:
                        a Puerto Rican, Sephardic Jew
                        "American poet" in front of a bank.

 According to Chris Stroffolino:

I want to apologize to anyone who has already tried to order Carnivocal in
the US. I posted the publicity on it in all innocence, but then someone
wrote to tell me she had tried to order it & General had no knowledge of
it. So I checked with Red Deer Press and received the following reply:

<<I actually forgot to mention that all of our fall titles become spring
titles in
the States. So, Carnivocal will not be available in the States until the
Spring.>>

Um, it seems that in my desire to advertize I jumped the gun a bit. If I
can find out that orders can be sent directly to Canada, I will let the
list know...

Gee, it's all very interesting reading the back & forth here, but I must
say I still tend to go with what a poet/editor told me many years ago: send
in some poems & a SASE. The poems should speak for themselves. And I have
to dmit that when I did edit, I found most accompanying letters got in the
way...

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics List was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its second incarnation,
the list carries over 750 subscribers, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time.
A number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
at the Electronic Poetry Center (see section 9 below).

Please note that this is a private list and information about
the list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list to those with specific
rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale of
the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. Due to the
increasing number of subscribers, we are no longer able to
maintain the open format with which the list began (at under
100 subscribers). All submissions are reviewed by the moderator
in keeping with the goals of the list, as articulated in this
Welcome Message. We remain committed to this editorial function
as a defining element of the Poetics List. Our aim is to support,
inform, and extend those directions in poetry that are committed
to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as
content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and
to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 5
below. Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 10.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 7
for details.

We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project. For subscription information
or to contact the editors, write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your full name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list should provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include all of
the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and send this one-line message, with no "subject" line
to <LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name. If you
find that it is not possible to unsub using your old address,
please contact the editors at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>
for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your
account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by
contacting the list administrators at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to ten days, or more, for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Submissions

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. All submissions
are reviewed by the editors in keeping with the goals of the
list as articulated in this Welcome Message (see section 1).
Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
poetics, messages relating to politics and political news or
activism will also be considered. Other sorts of news or
queries are welcome occasionally; please use "common sense"
when posting and keep in mind that your message, if forwarded,
will be distributed to 750+ persons the world over. Feel free
to query if you are uncertain as to whether a message is
appropriate. All correspondence with the editors regarding
submissions to the list remains confidential and should be
directed to us at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published,
or in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core
function of this list. Also welcome are other sorts of news, e.g.,
event reports, obituaries, and reading lists (annotated or not).

Queries may be posted to the list when deemed appropriate; if
responses are received backchannel and are of interest to the
list (i.e., if they are on topic), we request that the posting
subscriber assemble "highlights" from respondents' posts to be
published to the list.

Solicited submissions (by subscribers or non-subscribers) may
also appear on Poetics from time to time. The editors reserve the
right to contact any subscriber regarding possible submissions.

Posts to the Poetics List should abide by the rules of "Fair Use"
when quoting material for which the posting subscriber does not
hold copyright. Please do not post to the list personal or
"backchannel" correspondence, or other unpublished material,
without the express permission of the author!

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a
whole, or supply information missing from an post, or thank
someone for posting something you requested, please send the
request or comment directly to that individual, and not to the
list or to the list editors.

Send messages to the list directly to the list address:

     <POETICS@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list
to our administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

When sending to the list, please send only "plain text". Note,
however, there is no problem with sending clickable URLs in
HTML format.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents in a post, since this may make it difficult for
those who get the list via "digest" or who cannot decode
attached or specially formatted files. The use of "styled"
text or HTML formatting in the body of email posts to the
list appears not to be compatible with the the list's
automatic digest program; as a result such messages disrupt
the format of the Digest, even though this coding is
readable for some subscribers who do not use the digest
option.

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

As an outside maximum, we will accept for publication to
Poetics no more than 5 messages a day from any one subscriber;
in general, we expect subscribers to keep their post to less
than 10-15 posts per month. Our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers) of twenty or
fewer messages per day.

For further information or to contact the editors, please
write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

4. Cautions

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

Submissions to the list should be in ASC-II (text-only) format
and should contain NO HTML TAGS! HTML tags interfere with the
automatic digest and archive functions of the listserv program,
and will not be forwarded to the list. Subscribers using
Microsoft Outlook, Netscape Communicator and like applications
to manage their email service should check the "Preferences"
or "Options" section of the program in question to be sure that
HTML formatting options are disabled before posting to the list.

Attachments may not be sent to the Poetics List. Messages
containing attachments will be presumed to be worm- or virus-
carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list correspondence without the express
permission of the author! Copyright for all material posted on
Poetics remains with the author; material from this list and its
archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or
cause the list to reach its daily limit. These messages are
considered offensive and detrimental to list discussion. Please
do not bother submitting such messages to the editor. Offending
subscribers will receive only one warning message. Repeat
offenders will be removed from the list immediately. Please do
not put this policy to test!

-------------------

5. Digest Option

The Listserve program gives you the option to receive all the
posted Poetics message each day as a single message. If you
would prefer to receive ONE message each day, which would
include all messages posted to the list for that day, you can
use the digest option.

Send this one-line message, with no "subject" line to
<LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics digest

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this
message:

     set poetics mail

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

6. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

     set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 8 below.)

-------------------

7. "No Review" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information.

-------------------

8. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

The World Wide Web-based Electronic Poetry Center is located at
<http://epc.buffalo.edu>.

Our mission is to serve as a hypertextual gateway to the
extraordinary range of activity in formally innovative writing in
the United States and around the world. The Center provides access
to the burgeoning electronic resources in new poetries including
RIF/T and many other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS List
archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts and
bibliographies, and direct connections to numerous related
electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides information about
contemporary print little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in
poetry and poetics. And we have an extensive collection of
soundfiles of poets reading their work, as well as the archive of
LINEbreak, the radio interview series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

-------------------

9. Poetics Archives at the EPC

Go to the Electronic Poetry Center <http://epc.buffalo.edu>
and select the "Poetics" link from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. Or set your browser to go directly to
<http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html>.

You may browse the Poetics List archives by month and year or
search them for specific information. Your interface will allow
you to print or download any of these files.

-------------------

10. Publishers & Editors Read This!

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: The Electronic Poetry Center listings of
poetry and poetics information is open and available to you. We
are trying to make access to printed publications as easy as
possible for our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate!

Send a list of your press/publications to
<glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu>, with the words EPC Press Listing in
the subject line.

You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word
processing program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail
message to the address above to obtain a mailing address to
which to send your disk. Though files marked up with html are
our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable. If your word
processor will save files in Rich Text Format (.rtf) this is
also highly desirable.

Send us extended information on new publications (including any
back cover copy and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs or
backlists (including excerpts from reviews, sample poems, etc.).
Be sure to include full information for ordering--including prices
and addresses and phone numbers both of the press and any
distributors.

You might also want to send short announcements of new publications
directly to the Poetics List as subscribers do not always (or ever)
check the EPC; in your message please include full  information for
ordering. If you have a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention
that in any Poetics posts.

Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have
received a noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to
promote your publication and we are glad to facilitate information
about interesting publications.

   That particular quote of WCW's to Vazakas (a gay Reading-ite) does
   not, to me, seem particularly anti-semitic. He's pointing out a
   social irony--the germans kicked out the jews that invented the bomb
   that destroyed their allies. Even for a "non-public" statement, with
   all its attendant "freedom of expression" including flippancy, there
   is evident some feeling for the jewish there....
   On another point, is WCW's Puerto-Rican-ism. That he was himself
   trying to "pass". It's weird how little (in an age of identity politics)
   his puerto-rican element to the "american grain" is mentioned,
   though I hear SUNY-BUFFALO just accepted someone to its Ph.D. program
   who will deal with that issue in dissertation fashion....

      Congrats on Stephen Cope for his work on Oppen recently published
      in THE GERM. It is a quite interesting piece. I don't agree with
      ALL of it, but it is fascinating and worth reading (especially
      for those of us who've never been especially great fans of his
      poetry).....

just wanted to say that I (maria d) explicitly drew attention to the fact
that many different institutional/ pedagogical  contexts were represented
at the conference and that we'd do well to articulate some of those
distinctions and what they meant.  also, michael davidson, in a different
way, during his talk, dwelt a great deal on academic institutions and their
entanglement with various sorts of funding that affect what gets taught,
what poetry gets written,  how things get framed ideologically, etc.  Also,
Lyn H made the very apt comment that it is our institutions that need to be
re-educated, not necessarily our students.

Kent Johnson's righteousness - or at least that tone - about nailing WCW to
an anti-Semitic cross seems to me to indulge an easy dichotomy. I am not sure
if Johnson's trying to throw the Doctor out with the bath water, but I always
get uncomfortable when anyone (myself included) goes to the Holy ground with
an implicit claim of purity - what ever might be the issue. I would go as far
to say that my opposition to anti-Semitic, anti-Palestinian, racist,
homophobic or any other abusive behavior involves a personal acknowledgment
and desire to exorcise some part of my person that has inherited or learned
those behaviors (via ample examples whether in the language or acted out on
the street). I suspect there will always be that tension and fight in the
culture, at least my experience of it.
        But going back to Williams, is it possible to view his double-dipping
into offensive, particularly anti-Semitic language in the context of his half
or part Jewishness? In fact, in the same breath, has any critic delved into
this internal pluralism as one of the ways of looking into at least part of
William's interest and willingness to take on American culture as a
pluralistic condition. (Whereas Eliot and Pound, in the face of the European
migrations of the turn of the century, clearly took the xenophobic route out
of the country.) WCW is one of a number of great writers in this century who
are half or part Jewish. In the context of the evidence and questions
surrounding his anti-Semitic quotes, I think of Proust who, on one hand, was
one of the public leaders in the fight to free Dreyfus and, on the other,
Remembrance of Things Past has a strong share of anti-Semitic caricatures. I
suspect these internal battles are part of the condition of being a blend of
different cultures.

Not being Jewish, I, nevertheless, do have a sense that the issues raised by
those who are half-Jewish (in relationship to Jews and non-Jews) is bubbling
as something not spoken or addressed, perhaps ignored by some as a painful
taboo, or somehow an embarrassment to acknowledge. As to why, I cannot speak.
These are issues, of course, that can be raised about the work of any writer
who comes out of a biological blend of any historically oppositional groups
(and perhaps classes). I suspect for many who carry such blends, it's both a
gift and a curse - leading to these curious quandaries of point of view that
come up in Williams and others. These blends and the particular consequent
larger social overview, however, clearly lead to some great writing.

Cheers,

More later, but for now just to point out that this quote from
Mariani is rather pathetic as a "defense." Pound had strong
relationships with Jewish writers too. One can be subject to "the
popular racial myths of his time" and still have lots of
chummy relationships with the subaltern other! (Remember Yugoslavia?)

And as for those "comic-strip vulgarisms" (the Jewish kids in
Brooklyn ate those comics right up, didn't they?) that suffuse WCW's
letters, does Mariani imply that _everyone_ was using them? Of course
WCW was a "product of his time" as are we all, and of course he's a
"complex" figure. But choices can still be made, and one is not
condemned (especially one whose self-proclaimed task is to cleanse
the language!) to topple headlong into the most hateful vocabulary.
Mariani's little quote is quite simply apologetic slop of the
hero-worshipping kind.

And as for your reading of the "irony" in Williams's remark about the
Jews and the Bomb, I doubt it. "Kike" pops up like dandelions in
May in his letters and little irony is apparent. Be careful here.
It's one thing to misread comments about ready-made classroom phrases
that Language poets use; this is something of a more serious kind.

---two more cents' worth:

When subscription invitations are included with rejection slips, they
inevitably end up being sent to submitters who have already subscribed to the
publication. For a submitter, this is just as impersonal and irritating as it
is for an editor to receive submissions from writers who clearly haven't
looked
at the magazine. Surely every member of a magazine's staff ought to know the
subscriber list by heart, right???

It also implicitly links the rejection of work to the failure to subscribe,
which I think is a mistake. In my two years at The Iowa Review, the best
work I
saw almost always came in cold--- often multiply submitted, from names I
didn't
know, and generally unconcerned with whether it was like anything we'd ever
published before. The result is that every issue changed our own idea of "what
we publish."

Finding enough money to keep going is a huge problem, yes. But the problems
really start when you begin to feel guilty rejecting subscribers/supporters.

Meant subject line to be placeless yet can't figure out how to change in
pine.

My only concern abaout place was that it kept getting presented as an
absolute. Like I kept hearing, first get a place.

And that worried me b/c I can't get a place. I squatted one at U of
Hawai'i and then the football team squatted on top of me. I got crushed
under their equipment and had to get out.

So I wanted to say, there are things to do that aren't about place. Like I
think it is really great that the Writers House, got a house, got a
$40,000 startup, tehn got another million. I think that is the best thing
ever. And I love the Writers House devotedly.

But I think one could also take $20,000, if one can get that, and give it
to graduate student and they can make 4 journals and two chapbooks eries
and then yahoo, they've got a place in a different sense.

Or I would rather have production over housing.

But I do realize that sometimes one can have both. Which I imagine U Penn
can have.

And when you can get both, one should get both.

So my point was not very profound. Just reflecting my anxiety wfrom a
university that went from spending $4 aa square foot five years ago to
$.32 a square foot last year.

Why do poets need to submit to anything?  Given that we mostly believe each
our authority to be absolute in the realm of composition, and by extension,
to everything else that reference and/or non-references touches or "may"
touch,

it seems ridiculous to suddenly be compelled to convince some stranger, by
letter, what a great guy you are, and that s/he should publish your
accompanying poems, because, and because, ad nauseum. Silly to feel
responsible for reading them, sure, and no doubt horrifying to actually
write one,

an alternative may be working quietly and patiently toward, well, what "end"
is anyone working toward of late in The Art anyway?  It might be a relief &
pleasure to print your own poems, read/send them to friends, while writing
occasionally to the editors of those publications that excite you and (try
to) say in not inconsiderable terms what it is about the work in question so
makes it with you, etcetera.  Eventually someone may actually ASK for poems.
  I mean

let's don't be coy about it, one home truth is that the (poetry) publishing
enterprise IS related to personal relationships between and among those who
appear in this or that publication, ie., it's all very much clan-oriented,
despite claims to objectivity, plurality and all that, at base, one
publishes those who they admire.  Reasons for admiration are numerous, but
in most cases it's something that can't be conspired toward in a cover
letter.  I don't know ...

maybe there's too much "submitting" going on, without there being much
groundwork laid out in terms of intersecting or common interests between
those who have the Work and those who guide the Magazines.

And then again, there's likely little groundword laid out in the efforts of
those who submit blindly to the idea that blind submission leads somewhere
beyond the prices of the stamps.  It might be useful for us all to take some
measure of what it is we are doing (beyond submitting), and WHO it is we are
doing the how and why of it FOR.

I, for one, get almost no submissions (for Oasia Broadsides), tho I don't
advertise.  I ask.
Does that mean I'm operating a closed closet, a clothes closet, a close
closet, what?  Or I mean a "closed system"?  In what ways and to what extent
are we as editors supposed to remain "open" to all that accidence brings our
way, including the cover letters covering the curricula vitae, previous
publication lists and dangling modifiers of that sense of "person" that has
us all on some impersonal mailing list of places to send their enormous
manuscripts to? When Stephen Dignazio and I were doing :that:, we'd
occasionally receive manuscripts of up to 100 pages, despite the stated
maximum we could print was maybe five.  Nothing WRONG, tho, with this,
really

just a matter of wanting each our own submissions to be personally regarded,
like as if the editor had nothing else to read or do.  Which sort of goes
along with another misnomer, ie., that editors of magazines must therefore,
in the minds of those who haven't attempted editing a magazine, have loads
of money in addition to loads of time.  So it was and is always difficult
getting money for such projects, for this reason, and also because many of
those most interested have perhaps even less money than the editors.  But
money

is a problem for about 90% of the world's population. (What magazines are
THEY submitting to, we wonder ... ).  It's a disturbing conundrum, the
hustling after what looks to be mostly reputation.  Why does "authority" in
the sense I mentioned at the outset of this note have to mean authority over
others, the acquisition of power(publication = power, make no mistake).
Poets are specialists, yet the tongue is profoundly common.  That being so,
literal distribution needn't be the emergency it sometimes seems to be.
Power might be thought distributive rather than cumulative, and in that
sense, the organs of distribution - the literal number of them - could
usefully be expanded, rather than sticking to the submissive standards that
a more crowded henhouse might be said to require.  Ie., ever seen a
schizophrenic chicken?  'Nuff said.

The anti-semitisms of WCW, Pound and Eliot were indeed different,
cast according to the idiosyncracies of each. I never said they were
exactly the same. What I said is that WCW was "robust" in his
anti-semitism just as Pound and Eliot were robust in proclaiming
theirs. The record is there, and it is amazing and somewhat
disturbing to see people more or less trying to sweep it under the
rug. An essay on Williams that may cause the four listees mentioned
above to reconsider is found in Eliot Weinberger's _Works on Paper_.
There, Weinberger quotes an extraordinary exchange between Pound and
Williams on circumcision. I would ask someone to write back about the
"irony" in WCW's comments therein.

And on the Hiroshima quote, which the above Listees find slyly ironic
or else innocuous: Why not read the comment in its most obvious and
revealing sense--particularly given WCW's well-documented
prejudices? The remark is firmly in the classic knee-jerk
blame-the-Jew reaction (a la Hollywood, big banks, etc.): Truman,
Byrnes, Stimson, the Pentagon disappear, and it's the Jews (the
small minority of Jews on the Manhattan Project one supposes) who are
behind it all...  One could ask: Would someone who was _not_
anti-semitic be capable of making such a statement?

By the way, because I thought Weinberger would be interested in this
exchange, I shared some of it with him. In response to Michel Magee's
remark that

"... to simply call him anti-semitic or racist is to in fact
say nothing at all.  Among other things, one ends up missing the
crucial fact of how the speech of ethnic minorities mediated Williams
poetry: as in his famous characterization of his poetry as coming
"out of the mouths of Polish mothers."  Just who were these Polish
mothers, do you think?  I'd suggest that, like the Polish woman in "A
Face of Stone," they were Jews.

Weinberger wrote:

"Magee is totally wrong that the Polish mothers were Jewish:
obviously he doesn't know much about New Jersey! (You can quote me on
that one!!)"

I point this out in the spirit of suggesting that when it comes to
Williams, this matter of his vox populi as "mediated by ethnic
voices" is not unmediated by the ideological aura of "quintessential
americanness" that has grown up around his figure. And it may cause
us to jump to hasty conclusions.

gee kent,
what would he be saying if it weren't ironic? the awkwardness of the
opening phrase makes me imagine there's an opposition, a previous sentence
where he says the day of the blast everyone congratulates the scientists...
the day after...the poor jews, he doesn't say the bloodthirsty so and sos,
he doesn't say the money-hungry moabites, he says the poor jews with
perhaps an understood phrase here which might go who get blamed for
everything, he says we because he's a democrat, he's not aloof, he wants us
to realize we're all in the same boat -- we have met the enemy and he is
us.
cultural brainwash is hard for the best of us to transcend, i think he's
saying hatred is a cornerstone of america, anti-semitism was preached by
the catholic church into the 60s, whites only beaches government policy
into the 60s, until after Williams death.
the church pitted the blacks against the jews diverting attention from
their own slumlording, Henry Ford pointed the poor at the jews to conceal
his own  merciless exploitation, q.v. flint and fairborn?.

For what it's worth here at Outlet I prefer subtle mis-steps; it's like
realizing your "blind date" is a real person--heartwarming.

I agree that the writer ought to be at least vaguely familiar with the mag.
Also, it is nice to hear feedback on prior issues, and this is often the
only way it comes--not a great spectacle but true nonetheless.

And I'd also agree that all's fair in simultanaeity when you haven't heard

Who can tell what will happen in this topsy-turvy world, what the new day
will bring? Who can foretell anything in this floating world, where dreams
are words and words are dreams, where words dream sunsets and creeks spil-
ling over, flooding lands with waters and delights? In this fair world,
nothing is ever for certain, and we give ourselves up to whatever happi-
ness may befall us for the shortest while. In this evanescent world of
ours, butterflies may return to their chrysalides, clouds may pour forth
their very souls upon the earth. In this fleeting world, fortunes are made
and lost in an instant, loves sing forth upon new green shoots, and elder
logs make way for myriad and luminescent forms of life.

I miss Ted Berrigan tho I didn't know him. not to valorize him, not in this
edgy, price-conscious age. I miss the effect of him making or missing his
effect. didn't he have fun, no matter what hole he happened to dig? one sees
clearly
that I don't know him, he never saw me, we never parleyed. yet anyone can
think of the possible range, and the impossible. suddenly the rain seems
glamourous because we, you and I, have been discussing it and dodging it,
and remembering someone who did something, being something to our something.
you know, personal stuff in an age of cash rebates. no, valorization doesn't
work. Ted Berrigan will be Ted Berrigan till the very day he doesn't die. no
matter if the Collected Poems And Wants Ads of the poet finds its way onto
my shelf, the writer will be something, the reader something else. that
doesn't mean heat can't exist, we've all seen the loss of heat. so now a car
goes by because it's early morning. just linkage, a new age concept. if you
buy ten of these we'll throw in one of what you want, till the end of time.
I miss Ted Berrigan but not him only. I too have lived, thus my biography. I
could give particulars but they exist as marketing ploys. I sense something
somewhere because words haven't left, not in this rainy climate of value. I
get wise, or think I do. this business of what remains, when someone leaves,
or never was there, and other questions: who needs them? need them or not, I
will and you will continue to repeat them, even with this valuable rain. and
Ted Berrigan will remain somewhere. isn't that just about enough?

>>>Mr. Waber proposes that rejection letters ought to be accompanied
by a subscription form . . . "adding insult to injury," "rubbing salt in the
wound," etc. What do y'all think about this? Would you feel insulted,
salted, annoyed, demeaned or otherwise antagonized by such an
enclosure? I'd really like to know. Because we'd really like to have more
subscribers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why do you say only "rejection letters" should be accompanied by a
form?  What is it about your ~acceptance~ letters or, for that matter,
even solicited contributors that makes you leave them out of the
equation?  If you'd have qualms sending unasked-for subscription forms
to, say, a Charles Bernstein, or Geoffrey O'Brien, or Fanny Howe,
when you notify them of publication, that hesitation should apply to
those whom you decline to publish, as well.

Some things to consider:

It's perfectly legitimate for a magazine to run a subscription campaign,
and even to assemble a mailing list from the addresses of "submitters."
But, in scrupulous business terms, that effort should be treated as its
own separate account; otherwise, you're piggybacking your
development campaign onto the backs of somebody else's 33 cent
stamp.

There may be genuine reasons for deciding not to subscribe to journals
and to buy them in bookstores, instead.  The covers of perfectbound
journals are usually not designed to be folded over and squashed to fit
into narrow city mailboxes.  So immediately, subscription means reading
a damaged copy.

The publication schedule of small press journals is, as a rule,
undependable. You never know exactly when they're going to come
out. To be truly subscription-oriented, journals would have to hold
themselves to the same firm commitment of unbending dates as
periodicals, guaranteeing when the books will be sent out, and those
dates should be advertised as such.  A subscription is a ~contract.~
We're conditioned to these nuisances of punctuality and efficiency, and
paying for something that you're never sure when you'll see it may be a
reason for its unpopularity.

Also, the climate of non-literary journal magazines (glossies) we're
acculturated to, where subscriptions are standard, has learned to run
certain features to encourage an air of dialogue between the
subscriber/reader and the magazine.  Specifically, letters to the editor
columns or "polls" as part of the aura that builds a subscription base.
That's what you'd be buying into. Such lures foster (even if an illusion)
an impression of things being ~interactive,~ so that subscription fees
are dismissed as only part of a larger two-way communication. A
subscription campaign requires ~bait,~ in addition to the product itself.
In same Madison Avenue glossy culture, subscribers are offered
substantial financial discounts off newstand copies, which literary
journals do not offer. Or t-shirts or mugs.

By sending out subscription forms like that, now you're the one entering
into the "pretty please" realm of the unsolicited.  And you risk having the
reputation of your journal and its logo become part of the junk mail pile.

Personally, I've been spending about $35.00 a month, currently, sending
off for small press journals ($3, maybe $5, rarely $7 a pop) who do not
have national distributors.  (That does not include the off-the-rack ones I
buy, at about one a week; I have been known to buy $80.00 worth of
literary magazines at a single shot.) I find it presumptuous, this bias that
"submitters" are somehow not pulling their share of the weight. How do
you ~know~ that the recipient of the rejection letter hasn't bought every
issue to date? But, I must say, I very much like the feel of ~not~ playing
into conventional consumerism that comes of this practice.  It feels very
personal: whoever mailed that journal wrote "Thanks!" on the outside of
the mailing envelope! Converting the audience ("submitters") into cash
cow returns the literary journal to a whole ethos (sorry) of target
demographics and such, which I thought the iconoclasm of the poetry
was ostensibly subverting. And once literary journals have become
mixed into the blizzard of "Bill me later" forms, why not just belly up and
subscribe to ~W?~

An alternative to treating the (frankly unpromising) "submitters" as
golden goose might be to step up the drive for advertisers.

I hope this broadens the ramifications for "we'd really like to have".

anti-Semitism in _Works on Paper_ (New Directions).

From:          Eliot Weinberger <unreal@worldnet.att.net>
Subject:       WCW

Dear Kent--

Thanks for forwarding me the various letters on WCW, anti-Semitism, and the
Bomb. A few notes:

1) WCW is notoriously resistant to all attempts to summarize his thoughts
or opinions. Nevertheless, his writings are strewn with anti-Semitic
remarks: The short story that begins: "He was one of those fresh Jewish
types you want to kill at sight, the presuming poor whose looks change the
minute cash is mentioned." Or the essay "Against the Weather" that claims
that Judaism is a "tribal-religious cult" that is "precisely the
equivalent" of Fascism. (Written in 1939!) "Some fucking bastard of a yid."
"Horrible overfed Jewish types." And so on. All of which must be taken in
the context that one of WCW's grandparents was a Jew.

2) "Some of his best friends..." Well, ok. So were Pound's. (But not
Eliot-- the worst of the bunch because he was a snob.) Consider this
extreme case: Simultaneous to his promotion of the terrorist-segregationist
Kasper, Pound was having a warm correspondence with Langston Hughes. (They
had first become friends when Ez contributed to a fund-raiser for the
Scottsboro Boys!) Along with Jewish friends and African American lovers,
WCW was also collaborating with the bizarre Chinese White Supremacist David
Rafael Wang.

3) WCW's so-called Puerto-Ricanness has been explored, not so convincingly,
in a book by Julio Marzan called *The Spanish American Roots of WCW*. It is
rather like Alexandre Dumas' Negritude. WCW was not trying to "pass," as
someone said: he came from the age of the melting pot, and his were very
white (Spanish) Puetro Rican roots.

4) The assertion that the Polish mothers were Jewish is really a stretch.
Polish Jews are "Polish Jews" or "Jews." The default setting for "Pole" is
Polish Catholic, just as it is white for "American."

5) Hiroshima. When I first published the WCW letter-- in my essay on
Yasusada, as an example of the unreliability of poets as
"witnesses"-- it struck me as a bizarre take on the explosion of the
Bomb the day before. Since then I've come across an enigmatic poem by
Lorine Niedecker, written a few months later, and I now wonder
whether the identification of the Bomb as a specifically Jewish
artifact was not more general:

                New!
                Reason explodes. Atomic split
                shows one element
                Jew

                Now hide
                who can bombarded particles
                of international
                pride


6) It seems to me undeniable that it is very difficult to think of a major
American modernist who was not 1) black or Jewish AND 2) not racist or
anti-Semitic. Hatred is an absolutely intrinsic part of American modernism,
and as the heirs of that legacy we have to work it out.


                all best--

                Eliot

A critical moment is at hand.

At this time (8:30 PM PDT, 7/13/87) guards are acting under orders of the
Pacifica National Board to clear the KPFA building of protesters and ALL
STAFF!!

Mark Mericle was forcibly removed from the air earlier today, inspiring a
protest demonstration, which at this time consists of 300+ demonstrators.
The guards are now acting under orders of the
Pacifica National Board to remove not only the protesters, but also ALL
STAFF.  Protesters and staff are being arrested and taken away.  Let your
voice be heard!  Go to the station and protest the incredible acts of the
board!  Go and witness democracy disappearing from Pacifica ...

As always, check http://www.savepacifica.net for the latest on the crisis.

TEXT OF E-MAIL RECEIVED TODAY BY MEDIA ALLIANCE IN SAN FRANCISCO...
UNAUTHENTICATED AS OF 6 PM TUESDAY!

(Note: Micheal Palmer is a real estate developer in Houston, and
a member of the KPFT advisory board.  He has been said to favor
the sale of either KPFA or WBAI - both of which are "grandfathered"
onto commercial frequencies and are worth about $60 million and
$120 million respectively.  The money would ostensibly be used to
set up an endowment for Pacifica.

KPFB, referred to in paragraph 2, is a low power transmitter in Berkeley,
which reaches only the immediate Berkeley area.  It was originally
set up to simulcast KPFA's coverage to areas in North Berkeley which cannot
receive KPFA clearly because of hills between the transmitter and that
area.  It broadcasts some original programming, including live coverage
of  Berkeley city council and school board meetings)

To, I hope, clarify further:

Red Deer Press (its Marketing Assistant) told me this:

That would be to call Raincoast Books, which has a (Canadian)

It's $16.95 CAN (+ postage, I'd assume).

Just for the record, since this sounds like it's talking about Fence:  We
don't ask for queries or sample chapters or etc.

Since this thread seems to be viable, I'd like to ask a question, a
marketing question:

Mr. Waber proposes that rejection letters ought to be accompanied by a
subscription form or some similar form of encouragement. I think this is a
great idea, and in fact had meant to do just that when starting Fence, but
was voted down by the rest of the Fence people on grounds of "adding insult
to injury," "rubbing salt in the wound," etc. What do y'all think about
this? Would you feel insulted, salted, annoyed, demeaned or otherwise
antagonized by such an enclosure?

I'd really like to know. Because we'd really like to have more subscribers.

Dear poet friends:

I am putting out my second chapbook, titled "Goin' For Broke", for the
simple reason that I hope to use the proceeds to pay my fall tuition!
It's a mix of formal, narrative, and experimental free-verse poetry -- some
of which has been or will be published elsewhere; others of which actually
won an award.

For those of you who have my 1994 chapbook "Brave Walking," I am pleased to
say that the work in this chapbook is even better!

Each copy is $5. (An extra buck for postage and handling is gratefully
accepted.) If you're interested, please backchannel me your snail-mail
address, or mail check/m.o. directly to:

Robin Kemp

Selling poetry to pay for school?! It may sound impossible, but I think it
will happen if I can sell about 250 copies by August 17. (Registration is
the 18th; so far I am almost 1/3 of the way there. If I sell 75 books = 1
class, 147 books = 2 classes, 237 books = 3 classes.)

Thank you, everybody! And a special shout out to my friends in Atlanta and
Philly/West Chester!

Much love,
Robin

Some of you may be aware that Alan Loney, a fine poet and editor, has
recently relinquished the editing of A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE WHOLE
WORLD, a magazine of experiemental writing in New Zealand.

It continues as the only magazine in NZ supporting and supported by
experimental writers. The June issue now available, ABDOTWW/12, comprises a
reissue of Leigh Davis's long poem book, WILLY'S GAZETTE, which first
appeared in 1983. The magazine is proud to be involved in the reissue of
this landmark book.

For those of you who may have a specific interest in Leigh's book, or in
new writing in NZ, please feel most encouraged to be in touch. The magazine
is produced quarterly and a year's subscription is a mere $US25 (postage
included).

Years ago I sent in poems and SASE.  Then read article in literary magazine
in which several editors of poetry magazines termed this practice rude and
thoughtless.  The *least* I could do was to introduce myself, give the
editors some sense of who was sending the poems, and speak briefly but in
detail of the last issue of their magazine.  An editor on this list prefers
to have graduate school(and when attended), if any, and recent publications
in order to *place* the poet. Please, editors, publish these preferences
right along with the address for submissions.  thanks, RP

Kent, last post on this quickly tiring strain: 1) Eliot Weinberger's post
to you below is significantly more measured in its evaluation of WCW than
your own posts were; 2) nonetheless, his quoting of the line "He was one
of those fresh Jewsih types you want to kill at sight" is a
misrepresentation: it occurs in the short story I mentioned before, "A
Face of Stone" where it is *completely undone* over the course of the
story, as the doctor finds out that the wife of this man [the "Polish
mother" I mentioned before who is indeed Jewish] had "contracted rickets
in German occupied Poland because of severe malnutrition, that her entire
family had been wiped out over there."  Okay?  3) To say, "Yeah,
Pound had some Jewish friends too" is to distort the picture:
Williams had an *overwhelming* number of friendships with Jewish
poets and thinkers - few of them sheepish (i.e. they would have
really let him have it for any perceived anti-semitism.)

Look, I'm not trying to champion Williams's approach to race here, I'm
simply saying that to witch hunt him on this issue is *paralyzing* - it
prevents us from making any distinctions, any ethical choices, and in
fact, it replicates the very phenomenon of separating-wheat-from-chaff
that is the modus operandi of fascist action.  When Weinberger says that
"All of which must be taken in the context that one of WCW's grandparents
was a Jew," he is pointing toward precisely what I, and many others, have
been saying: that the question, "Why do anti-semitic trusims pepper
Williams's writings?" is not so easily answered; but if answered complexly
might be pretty valuable.

Stephen, if I point out, as I did, that there is textual evidence of
a strong anti-Semitic strain in Williams, why is this
"self-righteousness"? I responded to what I felt was a significant
blind spot in Billy Little's typically-provocative post, and did so
in a reasonable way, I thought. Then there were four indignant
responses, all of which strongly denied the applicability of the
term, a couple of these calling my post "ridiculous." So I responded,
pointing people to some specific evidence, and now am accused by you
of being self-righteous, by implication blind to my own likely
racism, and of trying to throw WCW "out with the bathwater."

I _love_ Williams. If he was more of a prick, more humanly sinful
than the canon-makers have let on, that does nothing to diminish the
greatness of his poetry. And in some ways the darkness makes
the greatness all the more fascinating! The record is the record
(which, yes, is open to differing interpretations), and I think it's
best to talk about it without the innuendo you interject above.
Kent

nice post, stephen.  i remember when the very Jewish Tom Lehrer's song
"National Brotherhood Week" played on the air, and the line "Everybody
hates the Jews," was roundly criticized by Jews and non-Jews for being
anti-Semitic, while i think, in fact, every Jew also recognized its ironic
"so what else is new" shrug --but didn't necessarily want that sense of
irony aired to the non-Jewish world for fear that it would be read straight
and thus possibly fan flames of anti-Semitism.  It's like the risk a Jew
takes when telling a "Jewish joke" (*not* an anti-Semitic joke) in front of
non-Jewish friends who may then go tell it in a context (for instance, in a
setting where there are no Jews) that makes it far more volatile.

We publish with First serial rights. We, as all journals in Canada do, have a
policy to publish only original, unpublished work. This is largely due to the
policy of our major funder, The Canada Council, who stipulate that journals
publish unpublished work. Nearly all journals in Canada receive significant
amount of support from the Can-Council, and its the main reason any of them
survive.

It is unfortunate that the infrastructure, policies and many decisions are
determined by the capitalist system but until you can actually publish and print
without it costing money, we have to negotiate that. I have learned that TCR
pays its contributors at the high end of the scale, and we're proud of that,
that we can and do support writers and artists. We aim to survive so we can
continue to do that.

Since I am only the Managing Editor of my journal, and there is an Editor who
makes the final decisions about what to publish, I don't think of myself as an
editor first but as an Arts Administrator. I fill in grant application forms,
handle the subscription list, promotions, publicity, manage the reading of 100
submissions a month with a small group of volunteers, organize and prepare board
meetings, fulfill all the legal requirements of being a nonprofit society, etc.

I look at it as a matter of survival and pragmatics; the editor does the
artistic direction. In order to gain resources and maintain them, I admit I do
see this as a business and make decisions based on principles like
"inefficiency" "strain on resources" and what not. So if a submission, or
anything else is obviously going to use up the time of myself, the editor,
and/or the volunteers without a possibility of fruition or a high likelihood of
difficulty that outweighs the results, I make the decision to reject it. The
simultaneous submission policy, as the policy of original, and unpublished work,
is clear in our guidelines which can be obtained by mail, email or on our
website; they are also listed in several writing market directories, though i
have recently discovered that that is with some severe mistakes on occasion. I
didn't put TCR into the position of competition, I think the simultaneous
submitter does that, out of a lack of knowledge for what effect it has on the
journal and of the monetary structure that the journal exists in.

On a final note, arts in Canada seems to be under a government compensation
system: the arts are presumed to not be able to survive in the regular consumer
market so the governments (municipal, provincial and federal) devise programs
that fund the arts in order to compensate for this fallacy of our economy. The
programs are full of hoops, and attempts at judging the value of a project, its
longetivity, and audience range, in order to have a rationale to justify funding
it. This results in a lot of catch-22s, most obviously that the larger one's
audience is, the more worthy of government support it is but the size of
audience is determined by the amount of money an organization gets from the
private sector, in subscriptions, admissions, etc. Related to this is the
constant encouragement to arts groups to become more independent and if they
don't make efforts towards financial independence, their funding is reduced or
completely cut. So while an arts nonprofit can begin being protected from
capitalist imperatives, it hardly remains protected from it (not that I think it
should be, entirely), as the ideology of market values seeps over through the
grant criteria and adjudication process. I don't know what to do about it.

I find it amusing that by indicating a poem and using the word
complexity I find myself implicitly accused of being an apologist for
anti-Semitism.

It must be nice be so . . . sure.

Pierre,

Thanks for passing this along - this morning KPFA is playing only
prerecorded broadcasts. Many staff, paid and unpaid, have been barred from
the building after yesterday's demonstrations, during which programmer
Dennis Bernstein was forcibly removed from the control booth by private
security goons hired by Pacifica executive director Lynn Chadwick, and 52
protesters were arrested. It's unclear to me right now whether Bernstein has
been fired, thus joining Larry Bensky and Robbie Osman, both of whom were
dismissed for violating an inconsistent and rarely-invoked "internal gag
rule" when they reported on-air about Chadwick's firing of KPFA general
manager Nicole Sawaya. As further evidence of the national foundation's bad
faith, their lawyers are moving ahead in pressing charges against protesters
arrested in an earlier non-violent demonstration, some of whom were
subjected to citizen's arrests by Ms. Chadwick herself after the Berkeley
cops sought to resolve the situation without taking people into custody.
Apparently the forcible application of state power couldn't come fast enough
for the executive director of an organization with its roots in opposition
to that very power, and whose nationally-syndicated news program, Democracy
Now, bills itself as "the exception to the rulers."

All of these moves are rooted in the Foundation's efforts to "restructure"
KPFA in order to maximize what Chadwick and Pacifica board chair Mary
Francis Berry have been calling, in a fairly odious rhetorical
sleight-of-hand, "diversity." Of course, this means nothing more than market
share, as is made amply evident by the "Plan B" option discussed in the
e-mail attachment you sent. For listees outside the Bay Area (and the WBAI
and KPFK broadcast areas in NYC and LA), today's article in the SF Bay
Guardian might be useful as a pointer to more info: "KPFA's local advisory
board - along with the boards of sister stations KPFK, in Los Angeles, and
WBAI, in New York - has filed suit against Pacifica, charging that the
foundation's new governance structure violates California's corporation law
(see "Pacifica Power Grab," 2/17/99). For more information, go to
www.savepacifica.net"

Sorry to take so much bandwidth for a non-poetry issue, but it felt
particularly resonant in light of the past few days' postings on
poetic/public "space." I.e., that here is a public space of both the
architectural and "productive" (thanks, Juliana) variety - and really, in
terms of radio, one of only a small handful left, given that the "other"
public radio, NPR, is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Archer Daniels
Midland. Not to mention that KPFA is probably the only station that ever
would have given Jack Spicer a radio show...

Best,
Taylor

Even as I write my review of Matthew Lasar's _Pacifica Radio_, it
threatens to become an obituary. When a self-perpetuating group of
people sit in absolute control of a large amount of money, they want to
play with it.

Curious antecedent to Stephen Vincent's writers of partly Jewish descent is
Michel de Montaigne, born 1533 C.E., *son of Pierre Eyquem ... & his wife
Antoinette de Louppes, the wealthy descendant of a Spanish or Portuguese
Jewish family...* quoting J.M.Cohen's introduction to his Penguin Classics
trans of Montaigne essays.  Just what this has to do with the Essays if
anything is unclear.

There may well be much more to say about Proust, who could hardly avoid
being aware of his part-Jewish identity during the Dreyfus affair.  Maybe it
would have been more obvious explicit or troubling an issue for Montaigne if
he had
lived in closer contact with the Inquisition in Spain, instead of in France.

But 19th/20th century senses of national & racial identities may have been
a more prominent insistent & troubling context than that of the 16th century
in France
for the issue to be an issue of concern?

Subject:      Schizophrenic Chickens
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Greetings--

I am new to the list and following this thread with interest. This latest
mail makes absolutely clear, for those who doubted it, that WCW was most
certainly anti-semitic. Whether his form of it was as "robust" as that of
Pound or Eliot, seems to me to be a kind of unhelpful
hair-splitting--certainly, it was less "robust" than Pound's if you consider
robust to mean having some real-world impact outside of a small circle of
friends and associates. But what is the point, aside from historical or
biographical interest, in this fact about WCW (or any of the others)? Does
anyone really believe that there's more than biographical information at
stake here; i.e. that the work is somehow "contaminated"? When Pound was
denied, by a close vote, the Bollingen (or was it Nobel? Can't recall) Prize
for Literature, the vote against him was a vote against his beliefs (his
acts of treason, really). Many people felt this was wrong-headed--that the
work, not the man, should be judged. I agree. I personally find the idea
that the man and work are inseparable to be an absurd idea, and one that
leads to all kinds of falsity--the falsity of trivializing the beloved
personage's hateful beliefs so that one can remain enamored of the work; the
falsity of trivializing reactions to all such hateful beliefs and remarks as
"politically correct" so as to remain enamored; the falsity of attributing
historical context (everybody did it) to such remarks so as to to remain
enmored; and the falsity of presuming that everyone holds such beliefs, but
are not as "honest" about expressing them.

Why attempt to "save" the work from the man? Can't we assume the man is
always merely the man, the mud instrument for the work? In fact, if anything
can ever save the man, it is the work.

All that being said, I also recognize that many good and senstitive people
can no longer enjoy the work once the source is found to be contaminated.
However, this fact should not lead us into the error of denial.

Yes, those were schizophrenic chickens--or maybe just "compartmentalized"
ones.

Subject:      Williams
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi Folks,

I have a lot of vague thoughts on this matter, being both of mixed ethnic
origin and from Rutherford, NJ (as I never tire of telling people, WCW's
son was my doctor when I was a lad, and in high school I would occasionally
feign illness as a pretext for intelligence missions).  I don't remember
reading about his collaboration with a Chinese white supremecist, nor have
I read the letters that speak of circumcision, which are no doubt pretty
ridiculous and stupid, though it is worth remembering that, of all the
"major modernists", Williams was (to me) the most seriously compromised by
his lack of "sweetness and light" in Arnold's phrase -- i.e. despite his
education in Switzerland (I think), at Horace Mann and in Pennsylvania, he
was pretty lacking in the "humanities" but often, to his credit, seemed to
go out of his way not to be cosmopolitan in the way of Pound.  He at least
felt bad enough about his suburban disposition to downplay his own role as
an unacknowledged legislator -- i.e. he classed himself as a "dog among
dogs."  In any case, here are a few rambling questions regarding this
subject (no answers):

     1. if he never created a "positive" image of a civilization or culture
that didn't include Jews, in the sense of a new Italy or Europe, could he
be classed with the anti-semitism of Eliot or Pound, who wrote extensive
tracts on the subject?
     2. to say that Williams, like Pound, had "Jewish friends" hence he was
not anti-Semitic is, yes, a bit weak (an older saw than the ginzu), but
what were the value systems of these Jewish artists that Williams
supported, values that he knew and recognized -- such as in Ginsberg's Howl
-- and how did they run counter to a classically contoured, Euro-centric,
authoritarian -- in any case "passeist" -- image that Pound and Eliot threw
up against the miscegenation that would be the inevitable result of liberal
capitalism?  I somehow think that Zukofsky's leftism was modified for Pound
by his choice, in the famous "Mantis" sestina for example, to utilize very
old forms, or the "luminous detail", method in putting forth his image of
civilization -- indeed, LZ seemed to believe that "civilization" had its
glories that were worth preserving, in opposition to say the pessimism of
much continental writing.  (LZ was also a faultless highbrow.)  But what
could be similarly modified in the writing of Ginsberg -- didn't you more
or less have to take the whole range of values or leave them?
     3. could Williams, who took pains, I tend to think, to differentiate
from a Puritan, self-policing sensibility -- hence his attraction to
Ginsberg -- be put under the same microscope as a Pound or Eliot?  That is,
even if he had a better side to him that recognized anti-Semitism,
especially in 1939, as something one does not want to humor as a political
disposition, isn't it possible that he also rejecting this self-negotiation
in favor of the "potency" of language -- after all, this is the guy that
sprinkled exclamation points in poems about flowers.  He kind of liked to
curse; the Calibanic strain was quite strong with him (to echo Obi Wan).
     4. on the note of racial slurs and things, I noted in my Philly Talk
much to the chagrin of the audience that there was a way that my Asian
friends and myself used to pick on each other in high school that was, for
me, therapeutic, involving those very ethnic slurs that we were often only
on the receiving end of.  Which isn't to say we became racist, since we
just used to pick on each other to sort of poke at the wound.  A little
later in life, this has grown, for me, into an identification with Korea
and the Korean people in a sort of direct but failing way, such that I
often, to myself, refer to Koreans as "my people" and Korea as "my country"
or whatever, and so when I hear of a North Korean submarine washing up on
the South Korean coast, I think, "what are my pathetic little people doing
now"?  I've only been there once, and of course I am not "Korean," but then
again I excercise a certain freedom possible to "Americans" to be that
other at least if it gives me comfort.  Obviously this is just an interior
play, something about exchangeable identities, and so forth.  I also tend
to have words like "gook" and "chink" floating around in my consciousness
quite often, not in conversation but in private thought, often on the verge
of finding their way into print, and sometimes they do get there -- why
not?  I don't tend to think of this so much as "self-hatred" or hatred for
an other, so much as a play on identity, a way of erasure through
signature, etc.  So in contrast to the interpretation of Williams use of
expletives as "ironic," it seems to me a different reading is possible.
I.e. Williams had a pretty strong memory of his Jewish grandfather -- isn't
pretty inevitable that we would have to read a relationship to this
ancestor of his in any terminology that he uses that would seem to class
him with the anti-Semites, the oppressive "other"?  Whose voice is he using
at this moment?
     5. what about Williams' relationship to Catholics -- those "Catholic
bells"?  I don't know the history well enough, but Rutherford now is pretty
heavy with Catholics (I was raised a Catholic), but I would guess that it
was a phenomenon just in the making in Williams' time. I tend to think
Williams -- who fetishized the word better than any "American" before him
-- seemed to fetishize everything from, again, flowers to pototoes (to the
"e" in potatoes) to too young girls to ethnic minorities (cf. Mackey's
well-known essay on his exclamation-point riddled poem on jazz music).
This seems to be where the Polish mothers meet the wheelbarrow, in a
specific over-riding ontology -- what is there is not me, etc.

As a last note, I tend to be wary of the granting of letters a confirmation
of the potency of the panoptic gaze, which is to say that a consideration
of the contexts of letters demonstrate that they hide as much as they seem
to "reveal."  I'll have to look those letters up, but considering that
Williams map of a "civilization" is one that would have to be more often
surmised than can be found elaborated linearly -- that he just wasn't a
systematic thinker -- his idiotic banter on the sidelines with a guy like
Pound -- whose system of thought was pretty ornate but tremendously
corrupted by his hatred and prejudices, considering that the system was
centered around ideas of beauty and wisdom, such that we would have to
believe this hatred quite intense for it to survive, and hence his
depression when he finally realized how intense this hatred was (it
suggests to me Carlyle's discovering upon the death of his wife that he was
quite a cad -- another Puritan sensibility run amock) -- could be taken in
many ways, perhaps even as the sort of masculinist sparring that we know of
that leads to an agreement in terms that are often less than agreeable.
Pound overwhelmed him more often than not.

I have no answers to the above questions in general, just thought to toss
them out.  I would suspect, I suppose, that Williams would behave
differently if he were in Rome in 1939, or that his letters would be
somewhat different, but since both his humanism and his anti-semitism were
not really challenged by much more than what he read in the papers -- i.e
his imperative to decide was not quite as strong as for a European -- then
much of this is speculation.

Anyway, I got to get back to work.

Cheers,
Brian

In response to Weinberger's dismissal of Eliot:

>2) "Some of his best friends [were Jews]..." Well, ok. So were Pound's.
>(But not
>Eliot-- the worst of the bunch because he was a snob.)

In spite of the fact that Weinberger is fond of accusing people of
prejudice (he does also with Ed Dorn and AIDS), it turns out that Eliot too
had Jewish friends.  According to a recent article by Ranen Omer, Eliot had
a 40-year correspondence with the famous Jewish-American philosopher,
Horace Kallen, coiner of the phrase "cultural pluralism."  Found in
Kallen's papers in the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati, these letter
are a major find.

I suggest that anyone interested in Eliot or the question of the relation
of anti-Semitism with Modernism read this article:

Subject:      PS on Williams
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

As a sort of postscipt to my other comments on Williams, I would note that
the quotes Eliot Weinberger draws from his stories, while being quite
powerfully derogatory, could be seen to consistently fall within the realm
of "speaking through the other," i.e. echoings of the local tongue and
prejudices, and also within my idea of the fetishized ethnicity.  My sense
is that Williams didn't belong to any local community in Rutherford in any
very easy way -- he felt quite alienated, as we all know -- so a lot of
what sounds like "plain speech" in Williams can often be seen as not his
own plain speech, until perhaps the Asphodel poem where it seems all him.
But that's because we know to whom he is speaking -- i.e. Flossy.  But when
he writes "He was one of those Jews..." sounding like he's addressing
someone, but who is this?  (If one imagines that he thought his first or
only readers for such stories would be his sophisticated New York literati
friends, many of whom were Jewish, how do these lines resonate with them?)

In any case, what would be interesting would be if someone could find the
kind of invective that one finds in Pound and Cummings and others, or the
kind of detached "objective" tone in Eliot's writing on Christian culture,
in Williams -- i.e. something more discursive and outside the realm of pure
imagism, something with a sure sense of audience and purpose -- since such
a thing would point to a more synthesized world-view in Williams that
presently we can't see.  I've never quite figured out whom Williams was
addressing in Spring and All, for example -- much of which, as I'd written
to a friend earlier, would sound like the most vicious "flame" on the
internet -- and I think this vagueness about his audience contributes to
the choppy, seemingly incomplete nature of his "career," i.e. the ups and
downs of his work.

Also, can I suggest Marianne Moore as a modernist not motivated by hate or
exhibited anti-semitism?  I'll probably find this wasn't the case.

the poets in the minefields of Pennsylvania labour day and night to produce
the fairest examples of their craft. in California the entire population is
in love, dreamy love, love without bounds or off track betting. in the wee
country of Liechtenstein comrades walk straight to the shoe factory every
morning to receive their free sneakers. in Rwanda the lions share their
bread with the dead. and while this joy more than subsists, the moon looks
down. the moon has pretensions to understanding, just like us, for the moon
rolls thru the heavens tied to earth's mesmerizing gaze. most people don't
care about that. in every inch of the land once known as Russia people open
boxes with hope in their hearts. in Japan, the brilliant bullet trains add
zest to understanding: such suddenness, such noise! and on it goes. a puddle
called Walden Pond extrudes facts daily, and when people drown there, they
drown deeply. no mention yet has been made of the delightful fund of lyres
that the Grecian model government stockpiles for times of need, an agreeable
figurative uncommon hug for one and all. France has learned to emulate the
finest mountains of Peru, and even Parisians (formerly, a pox on them) are
newly cheerful and inclined to greet Incas without ponderous escapade.
Honduras cannot hide its cheeky aurora, Canada has half a mind to shout with
glee, Tonga and Madagascar have learned frantic hand-holding tricks, Poland
grips the ball with fiery new surety, everything Chinese adds the lift of
oneness, trees sprout in the rocks of Thailand, chirping Floridians remove
their masks, and everyone, everywhere, dances this glow. all this, friends,
can be shipped right to your doormat.

I suppose there's another question hiding in Rebecca's (not to put
questions in your mouth): I'm also curious what others think about
submitting to journals/magazines you don't subscribe to.  I would
say more than 95% of what we receive at TCR is from people not
on our subscription lists (I'm sure this is a common story).

On the subject of BLUESTOCKING Books, a few words as to the contribution that
might be made to the art/political culture of lower Manhattan by the books
that need to be written there as well as sold, the people writing them and
selling them, and the classes that must be organized.

As for the books on the shelves, one might search among them for titles
having also to deal on a day-to-day TimePoint with such urgent issues of the
moment as the planned August 21 March of the Klan in Cleveland (see 7/13
Plain Dealer), on-going  defense of Abortion Clinics, lesbian and gay rights
to Privacy of the Bedroom and freedom from Surveillance, in addition to a
good many rare volumes by such leaders of the Russian and Cuban revolutions
as Inessa Armand and the Argentinian photographer, Tania.

This is only a fragmentary list, but one which I think points to why support
of what a BlueStocking Bookstore could do and the importance it could have in
a major city like New York.  Many of the titles made available at this kind
of store are simply not available in commercial and academic venues, and
given the generally accepted perception that independent bookstores promoting
Free Thinking are being pressed out of existence, it is also important to
encourage writers to commit themselves to making available to as large a
public as possible all popular philosophies and programs for social action.

Ideas are worthless unless they're made real.  BlueStocking Books has the
potential to become a social center, like the New Workers' Center in Juarez,
staffed by volunteers committed to getting out the news concerning the
widening resistance to any and every effort to take away such basic
democratic rights as Freedom of Assembly, Freedom of Speech, and Freedom of
Thought and Expression.

Please give your every consideration to building a space big enough to meet
the needs of BlueStocking Books.

THERE MUST BE PROFOUND CHANGE.

This is very disturbing. While I certainly agree with Michael Magee's plea
for an examination of Williams' antisemitism as a complex phenomenon, I
don't think that part of that complexity is explained by Stephen's
suggestion that Williams was in some way reacting to or against his
partly-Jewish ancestry. Williams, as far as I can gather from the writing,
never thought of himself as Jewish or part-Jewish, never thought that
culture was genetic. His antisemitism was entirely of the class-determined,
unconscious, or at least unexamined, variety (I doubt he thought it was an
issue, at least before 1940, although I'm sure he behaved appropriately
with his Jewish friends), the variety of antisemitism that nowadays in the
US is most likely to cause pain. Although it doesn't hurt to remember that
the more violent kind exists here as well.
Maria, I can't tell from your post if you're aware that the reaction you
site to Lehrer's song was motivated by fear. Social ostracism, and a lot
worse, on these liberated shores, is well within the memories of Jews of my
generation and yours.
I would suggest that this is a subject on which to tread lightly. It never
occurred to me that Kent was disowning Williams, whom I too revere. But the
wounds are very fresh.

When I was a little kid we used to vacation at a cheap resort in the
Poconos, which were a lot more remote before the construction of I-80 than
it is now. I became close friends with the owner's son who had a black
German Shepherd names Nigger. I don't think he'd ever met a Black person,
but I don't doubt for a minute that he and his family were racists. But
maybe when he called his dog he was feigning a persona.

Subject:      Pound and the Nobel Prize
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Someone suggested that those who had denied Pound the Nobel Prize had
failed to separate the work from the man. They were in fact remembering
some of the more disreputable works.
When Kurt Waldheim, after his UN career, was discovered to have committed
war crimes there were some who objected to his being elected president of
Austria--his great post-war service were apparently enough to excuse his
earlier behavior as far as the Austrian electorate was concerned, but the
critics felt that some things are unforgiveable and that to honor the
perpetrator is to diminish the apparent seriousness of what had been done.
Pound wasn't a war criminal, merely a fellow-traveller of war criminals,
but that's bad enough. To deny him the prize was not so much a judgment on
the Cantos as a decision not to be seen as forgiving the unforgiveable in
the context of a Europe where passions like those who had expressed during
the war were and are very much alive.

also in response to the message below.  If it makes no sense, it may be
that my brain is fried from completing a dissertation (on Oppen).  Anyway,

Brian, yes, - there may be evidence of anti-semitism by Moore out there,
but I've certainly never come across it, and have always taken heart in
these lines which conclude here wonderful homage to miscegenated culture,
"The Labors of Hercules" ("To popularize the mule" is the objective stated
at it's beginning):

"that the Negro is not brutal,
that the Jew is not greedy,
that the Oriental is not immoral,
that the German is not a hun."

If I'm not mistaken, this was written in the early '20's (was she
regretting that final line ca. 1940?  - probably not: the point seems to
be as much about adjectives standing in for complex wholes as it is about
objecting to specific cases of racism, although for her these two things
would finally have been inseparable.)  Anyway, thought I'd mention it.
Thanks for your fine posts on this subject!

i agree, this is a volatile thread and one that i care a lot about and want
to participate in, not because of W C Williams so much (though these quotes
from Kent and Weinberger are new to me, disturbing, and interesting) but
because i find Jewishness, so-called "Jewish self-hatred," and
anti-Semitism to be compelling and complex subjects.  in my post i
explicitly said "for fear that it would be read straight and thus possibly
fan flames of anti-Semitism." so yes, i do see fear as a motivating force,
but perhaps not as strongly as you do.  perhaps i shd rethink that relative
lightness.  On the other hand, I think Jews should be less fearful of
debating Jewish complexity in public --to be silent on these complexities
is, i believe, to capitulate to the mainstream culture's desire to keep
Jewish discussion of Jewishness at the margins.  Sometimes when I've posted
something about being Jewish on this list, I've gotten back-channel
acknowledgements and thanks from other Jews for my post --but not public
posts.  While I certainly respect each Jewish person's right to determine
the degree to which he or she wants to protect him or herself around such
issues, and while i appreciate the delicacy and beauty of an "invisible
community" forming under or adjacent to the mainstream lines of Poetics, i
welcome the publicness with which this thread is being conducted. tho i may
change my mind at any moment.

Subject:      Manifest Destiny
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

The "field" of racism re: Williams, Pound & Eliot extends beyond the bounds
of a specific anti-semitism; ancient cultic law is not based on tolerance.
Not to be overly "Hebraic" about it, the fact remains that the murder of
former Israeli Prime Minister Rabin had, in some interpretations, rabbinical
sanction.  Semitic law in general gives sanction for murder, if evidence
exists - and suspicion is often thought sufficient evidence - that a person
presents a threat to the security of the clan at large.  We still operate
under a similar system, as a glance at who's who on any Death Row will tell
you.  Enemies of the State.  America wasn't founded to protect the interests
of any sense of the common man or to the common good; it was founded to
protect the interests of a wealthy group of molasses bootleggers operating
out of the Carribbean.  Interesting in this light to recall that Washington
initially considered making Hebrew the national language, probably having to
do with aligning America with the moral authority represented by the rise of
"Israel" at the end of the world in the Book of Revelations.  Nineteenth
century Manifest Destiny is a pure product of nothing but.  In fact, the
genetic/hereditary science of Eugenics was a 19th century American
invention, and the Sterilization Laws passed in 1907 by the State of Indiana
"to prevent procreation of confirmed criminals, idiots, imbeciles and
rapists" was the prototype for Nazi-funded scientific missions to find
"reason" for persecution of Jews.  WCW, Pound, Eliot & Co. - "us all" too -
are the inheritors of this tradition.  Given this, the accusation that these
guys were "anti-semitic" seems trite; the more essential question lies in
the extent to which they - or any of us - gave (or in our case, continue to
give) sanction to state-infected suppositions toward "liberation."  Calling
WCW anti-semitic merely sweetens the lie that we in fact DO have the moral
authority to "call him down," but what phantom will rise from the process of
so doing?  Or more specifically, though maybe slightly off the mark, what
are the relations between poetic form, natural proportion and human law, for
example, that permit the existence of a sort of "screen" or "grate" through
which we may have intimations of the smell of death, but no actual access to
the causatively related "killing floor"?  When the feeling of "threat" is
multiplied into an analogical "house of mirrors" (and perhaps of cards), how
do we identify it, ie., how do we get into the basement over which the
killing floor is laid?

why not just print your rejection slips on paper that has submission
info on the back... they will most likely notice it due to the way paper
is folded into an envelope

if they are already subscribers they will notice how clever your
stationary is... if they aren't they will think it's clever and may
start subscribing or may not

either way, no extra paper wasted and no insult is intended

#2: will work best if you print the info in a different color (see the
red or green ink copier at Kinko's), to differentiate from the black ink
of the letter

#3: would look great if the info took up about 1/3 a sheet of paper (or
less) and was printed multiple times down the back of the paper, with
the top and bottom "copy" being cut off by the page: as if the entire
sheet of paper was machine produced in that form

#4: this could even be done with a custom handstamp

for the record: I spend about 100 times the amount on newsstand copies
vs. subscriptions, but am trying to even out the trend a little

     I think your point about the *Jewish joke* is accurate.  To laugh at
     one's stereotypes tends to render it harmless, but from others it has
     the threat of danger.

     Not to prolong this much further, but I think that to judge WCW based
     upon the mores and political correctness of our time takes him out of
     the context of his time.  I agree with m. magee "that  the question,
     "Why do anti-semitic trusims pepper Williams's writings?" is not so
     easily answered; but if answered complexly might be pretty valuable"
     Why do people affiliate themselves with specific race/religious/class
     groupings, but also retain certain inbred prejudices against them?  I
     find WCW's position interesting indeed, but perhaps that's because I'm
     half Puerto-Rican, brought up with a Jewish stepfather and family.

     I will say that based upon my experience with a multicultural,
     multiracial, multi-religious family is, even those who consider
     themselves "liberal" for their time still retain certain prejudices.
     My (Jewish) grandparents, who were highly educated, well-respected,
     well-read, well-traveled, and fairly "liberal" for their time, still
     had prejudices.  They were never overt about their opinions, and I
     wouldn't classify them as ever having been "racist", but I think that
     they, like many others of their time (brought up just prior to the
     women's movement, the civil rights movement, racial pride, etc)
     unconsciously grasped onto the usual opinions, even as they didn't "in
     principle" believe in it.  We expect everyone we admire in history to
     have the sensitivity we have "now" towards complex issues.  I think
     it's relative to one's place in time.  Picasso was misogynistic towards
     women, but that doesn't diminish his massive contribution to 20th
     century art.  In fact, his misogny produced some of his most effective
     works, because the subjects of his work were some of the women he put
     through the wringer.  In that way we should view WCW's work--how did
     his dual sympathies/prejudices against race/religion figure in giving
     his work the brilliance it has?  Seems a much more productive vein to
     approach him than an attack on the standards of his time and his own
     human frailities.

     Yours,

nice post, stephen.  i remember when the very Jewish Tom Lehrer's song
"National Brotherhood Week" played on the air, and the line "Everybody hates
the Jews," was roundly criticized by Jews and non-Jews for being
anti-Semitic, while i think, in fact, every Jew also recognized its ironic
"so what else is new" shrug --but didn't necessarily want that sense of
irony aired to the non-Jewish world for fear that it would be read straight
and thus possibly fan flames of anti-Semitism.  It's like the risk a Jew
takes when telling a "Jewish joke" (*not* an anti-Semitic joke) in front of
non-Jewish friends who may then go tell it in a context (for instance, in a
setting where there are no Jews) that makes it far more volatile.

Yes, yes, it is, George. But Pete is referring to the great scene in the bar
where a drunken Mowbray haltingly recites Hamlet's soliloquy, falters, then
gives it over to Doc Holliday to finish. I don't know the source of the
quote Pete's referring to and it's driving me nuts since my VCR is broken
and I can't pop in my copy of "Clem" to check it out. This film also
contains this classic exchange, set in the same bar:

Fonda/Earp: "Mac, you ever been in love?"
Mac: "Nope, I've been a bartender all my life."

Just a quick comment on the editors who have been complaining
(legitimately) about people who submit but don't subscribe. At least a
few of you haven't posted to UB poetics, subsub, etc. when you have new
issues coming out. Why not send a brief post with a list of contributors

The Million Artist March
On The Avenue Of The Arts
in Philadelphia
on Saturday, July 17, 1999


The Million Artist March is organized by MAMOTAA, an arts advocacy group
under the non-profit umbrella of Jobs With Peace. MAMOTAA's goal is to send
one million signatures to Congress requesting that art programs be
reinstated in the public school curriculum. We also ask that art teachers
and artists be hired to teach these programs. MAMOTAA's work will not end in
July 17, 1999. We will continue to be an arts advocacy organization, job
bank and information center until Washington addresses this issue.

The day will begin at 11am with a dance, music and color-filled march from
the Avenue of the Arts to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway where seven stages
will provide music performance and spoken word events. The Parkway will be
lined with tables to sell original art work.

If you're an artist, art student, parent or concerned citizen, come to
Philadelphia to show your support. CELEBRATE for a cause.

Please sign the petition and forward to friends, family and e-buddies. Call
and ask for details about sponsoring and art ride to Philadelphia for the
march.

I stand corrected.
Apparently Pound was sad not to be honored by the manufacturer of TNT.

I hesitate to respond to this. Are you saying that everything is the same
and no differentiation is possible?

Your interpretation of the American Revolution seems rather simplistic, but
let that go. I'd love to see some documentation of Washington's thinking
about making Hebrew the national language--it's new to me. And as to his
interest in the Book of Revelations--I thought he was a deist.

Hi George,

Your memory doesn't fail you - My Darling Clementine is indeed about the
fight at the OK Corral and stars Henry Fonda.  Shortly after Fonda/Earp
becomes Tombstone's Marshall, a touring Shakespearean actor,
Mowbray/Thorndike, comes to town.  He's quite a drinker and is joined in his
cups by Dad/Ford(John Ford's brother). Mowbray has some poignant scenes with
Fonda and Victor Mature(as Doc Holiday), especially one involving Hamlet's
"To be or not to be..."  When Mowbray/Thorndike leaves town, he embraces
Dad/Ford and recites what may or may not be more of the Bard.  The piece
begins "Great souls" and mentions "allegiance" and ends with "burn."  It's
very touching and a beautiful recitation. I'm wondering about the origin of
the quote and hoping it rings somebody's bell. I urge everyone on the List
not busy trying to figure out if WCW was anti-Semitic or debating how best
to get into print to rent My Darling Clementine and hear the quote
firsthand.  Bonuses: Linda Darnell singing, "In gambling halls he was
laying, 10,000 cattle straying." and Ward Bond cussing in Spanish.

Mark, I understand where this is coming from vis a vis the Williams
discussion, but it also seems worthwhile to point out that you've framed
the issue in a classic and, to me, ultimately limiting way.  Essentially,
you're replaying a critique levied by Lukacs against existentialism -
specifically Kierkegaard and Heidegger.  Lukacs says that their refusal to
acknowledge the unity of the Self (eg, K's view of the individual as
"incognito") was just bullshit:

They "embraced this doctrine of the eternal incognito which implies that a
man's external deeds are no guide to his motives.  In this case
[Heidegger's], the deeds obscured behind the mysterious incognito were,
needless to say, these intellectuals' participation in Nazism...But if
this impenetrable incognito were the true 'condition humaine,' might not -
concealed within their incognito - Heidegger or Schmitt have been secret
opponents of Hitler all the time, only supporting him in the world of
appearances?"

Now, what Lukacs says here really strikes a cord.  I won't get into the
whole issue of Heidegger and Nazism.  What I will say is that Lukacs'
logic - though I sympathize deeply with his dilemma - is flawed. It
presupposes that the only critique of the Unity of the Self falls along
the lines of this existential concept.  Lukacs, it seems to me, comes out
of the humanist aspect of Marx and Marxism: the self is ethical and whole:
if not, than it is damaged and unethical (evil).  In the world of
continental philosophy of the 30's Heidegger and Lukacs may have seemed
like the operative poles (though the Franfurt folks & I think
particularly Benjamin offer an alternative) - but as regards Williams,
there's John Dewey, there's Kenneth Burke, offering very important
alternatives to a Lukacsian perspective on the self which stays well away
from this issue of the Incognito.  Dewey: "individuality itself is
originally a potentiality and is realized only in interaction with
surrounding conditions."  This statement didn't *deter* Dewey from
critiquing the unity of the self - it was in fact the *predicate* by which
he understood the self as a multifarious, multimotivated construction; and
through which he recognized that deciphering the motives behind
individual actions (including speech acts) required the same sort of time
and heightened attention and open-mindedness that an anthropologist (a
good one) brings to the activities of whole communities.  So, just to say,
that when I ask for complex thinking on this WCW/anti-semitism it is from
this latter, pragmatic perspective, though not without knowledge of
Lukacsian exasperation.

Pound did in fact win the first Bollingen prize judged by, among
others, Tate, who wrote two very interesting articles on awarding this
prize to Pound-- the New York Times favorite treasonous fascist, for
the _Pisan Cantos_ specifically which I see as an explicitly
anti-semitic and fascist section of the Cantos and arguably the most
aestheticly innovative and complex section as well. Pound despised Tate
as critic and a poet, and Tate discusses his decision and the
complexities of Post-War Pound in relative detail. I find this strain
on WCW and anti-semitism very interesting. The interest in an authors
identity and the value of that identity in relation to the work, I feel
for me at least, is still open to investigation. I think it depends on
how one wishes to read, under what kind of conditions the experiment is
given, in what labratory we choose for it to take place. For this
century it is a pressing demand in light of the WWII. An attempt to
return history, I think, to the work. I'm skeptical of the fall back to
the ironic reading, WCW adopting the voice of this or that position in
order to somehow radically subvert this or that position. Are these
poems then satires? I felt, and still do feel, that Williams deployed
very negative images of African-Americans in Paterson, and if I choose
to call that racism, which I do, it doesn't necessarily mean that I
dismiss Williams for that. I doesn't necessarily follow that I am
playing a holier-than-thou gambit either. I want to read Williams as a
poet and also as historical happening.

Mark,

Pls see my comments below.

>Someone suggested that those who had denied Pound the Nobel Prize had
>failed to separate the work from the man.

Yes, I suggested it. Actually, it was the Bollingen as someone else pointed
out.

They were in fact remembering
>some of the more disreputable works.

Hmm. By "disreputable" I assume you mean with anit-semitic or treasonist
content. (?) I followed the controversy fairly closely at the time as I was
embroiled in huge "discussions" about it with my Jewish boyfriend--who, BTW,
was also a poet and claimed to be unable to even read either Pound or Eliot
after their anti-semitism came to light. Their work had been absolutely and
irrevocably contaminated for him. Of course, these awards all have a
political component anyway, so it isn't saying a whole lot that this was a
"political" decision.

>When Kurt Waldheim, after his UN career, was discovered to have committed
>war crimes there were some who objected to his being elected president of
>Austria--his great post-war service were apparently enough to excuse his
>earlier behavior as far as the Austrian electorate was concerned, but the

Yes, and I have to agree with those critics re: Waldheim. I mean, being
elected president is quite a bit different from being given a prize for your
writing. And, committing war crimes is also quite a bit different from
making anti-semitic remarks--or even making those boradcasts.

>Pound wasn't a war criminal, merely a fellow-traveller of war criminals,
>but that's bad enough.

What about the pro-Mussolini broadcasts? Not a "war criminal" per se, but
pretty actively treasonous. He would certainly have gone to jail if he
weren't pronounced insane.

To deny him the prize was not so much a judgment on
>the Cantos as a decision not to be seen as forgiving the unforgiveable in
>the context of a Europe where passions like those who had expressed during
>the war were and are very much alive.


Exactly the point I'm making. It was **not** a judgement on the work at
all--but, ideally, should have been (in my opinion).  I think the work is,
must be, separate from the man (or woman). This is not to say that I find
the behavior trivial. When Eliza Kazan stood and received a "lifetime
acheivement" award at the Oscars this spring, I found it distressing--most
of the people he had harmed were still alive, or at least their families
were. It seemed incredibly disrespectful to them and I was happy to see some
people remain seated, not applauding (e.g. Nick Nolte). But when the
retrospective came on--Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, etc. all
those incredible films--I was completely moved by the acheivement. I again
came round to the belief that the work is the reality for an artist/writer,
not the life.

Of course, a lot of the issue is how these prizes are awarded, publicized,
etc., and made to **seem** to the public, to be awarded to the person, not
the work. If Kazan didn't show up, it would have been easier to take.  And,
as you rightly point out, an award to Pound would certainly have **seemed**
to be condoning his actions as a man--enough reason to not give it to him.

Best,
Joan

On rejection with ad enclosures:

If someone is offended by this practice let them be.
Poets are a dime a dozen and twelve more will show up. Readers are a
much rarer commodity.
The gig is to diseminate information, not appease the ego of the kind of
writer who will be so infinitely hurt by a rejection as to not recover.
They will not recover; preferably disappear.

There is only one form of demeanment and antagonization I am aware of. A
magazine that does not respond to queries about a first correspondence.

Or does something similar to Big Allis. After a two year submission
period, they send a letter which states they still had not read the
pieces and are sending them back. Magazines who are not responsible to
their constituency will suffer accordingly.

Be well

Radio Protests Stream in MP3

Oscar S. Cisneros

6:40 p.m.  16.Jul.99.PDT

In what may be the first live protest streamed in the MP3 format, activists
and ex-staffers of an independent radio station on Friday netcast their
objections to being ousted.
The sound quality was poor and speakers' voices were inaudible at times,
but the protesters' jubilance rang clearly enough.
"We must fight for free speech," shouted one speaker, to cheers from the
crowd. "Without free speech we have nothing."
A string of firings that began in March at KPFA -- an independent radio
station in Berkeley, California -- spawned a series of protests.
Demonstrations escalated Tuesday when KPFA's owners, the Pacifica
Foundation, had armed guards forcibly remove staff members from the
building. One announcer was on the air at the time. Most staff members were
placed on administrative leave.
Nine nonstaffers who protested the removals have been arrested, and police
have used batons to control the crowds (400-strong at times) that the event
has attracted.
Pacifica had forbidden staff from discussing the firings on the air, but
some employees defied the order and did it anyway.
"I saw the demonstration and I thought, 'These people should start
broadcasting on the Internet,'" said netcasting expert Sameer Parekh. "On
Thursday I set up the broadcast equipment and Thursday evening we did the
first broadcast."
Parekh accomplished it by setting up a 50-watt micro-broadcaster to cover
the downtown Berkeley area, and a server to stream the action over the Net.
Using Icecast, an open source MP3 streaming server software suite, and a
community server hosted gratis by AboveNet, Parekh began streaming the content.
Ousted KPFA staff burned a CD of previous broadcasts critiquing Pacifica's
tactics and calling for more community control of the radio station. Parekh
has been playing the CD over and over since Thursday night.
Parekh also wants micro-radio stations to lift the streams he's sending
over the Net and broadcast them.
"If they plug the reception of my Internet stream into the micro-power
broadcasters, then their local communities can have access to the
demonstrations," Parekh said.
Elan Fabbri, a spokeswoman for Pacifica, said that debate over the station
is misplaced.
"This is not about free speech. It's about a labor dispute," she said. "We
have a union contract at KPFA that has been violated."
Ken Ford, a member of Pacifica's national governing board, said that the
staff was placed on administrative leave not as a punitive action but for
their safety, given the protests and tensions surrounding KPFA.
Protesters, he said, have not answered Pacifica's calls for mediation
because they can't agree on who will negotiate for them. Ford had never
heard of MP3 but said the 50-watt broadcast portion of the operation was
illegal.
"It's a pirate station, basically," he said. "They're busy little beavers,
aren't they?"

I thought the List might want to look through this: an excerpt from William
McGuire, Poetry's Catbird Seat (the consultantship in poetry in the English
language at the Library of Congress, 1937-1987), Library of Congress,
Washington, 1988, 512 pages, ISBN 0-8444-0586-8. This (very selective)
excerpt is 1,500 words long .

==============================

In 1948 The Bollingen Foundation's trustees voted an allocation of $10,000
for ten years of literary awards. [ . . . ] (The Foundation's name had been
Mary Mellon's oblique way of honoring C. G. Jung, who had a country retreat
near a Swiss village called Bollingen.) [ . . . ]

On March 4, 1948, a Library of Congress press release announced the
Bollingen Prize in Poetry. Carrying a purse of $1,000, the prize would be
awarded each February for the best book of verse by an American author
published during the preceding calendar year. The jury of selection would
be composed of the Fellows in American Letters of the Library of Congress.
[ . . . ]

A final ballot was cast by mail in February (as the 1948 prize would lapse
on February 28): ten first places for Pound [for The Pisan Cantos], two for
[W.C.] Williams, one abstention (Paul Green's)-and the vote of Theodore
Spencer, who had died a few weeks before, was taken to stand as a first
place for Pound, as it was he who had placed the Pisan Cantos in nomination
back in November. [ . . . ]

The story was broken on Saturday night, the nineteenth, by Charles
Collingwood in his radio news broadcast. The Sunday New York Times headline
was characteristic of the press reaction: "Pound, in Mental Clinic, Wins
Prize for Poetry Penned in Treason Cell." As Evans (Luther H.Evans, the
Librarian of Congress) later observed, "The award possessed that bizarre
quality that makes news. Along with excited reports, indignant editorials
appeared in the press." An editorial in the New York Herald Tribune,
however, stated: "This emphasis on an objective criterion of beauty and
excellence, akin to belief in an objective truth, is fundamental to a free
and rational society. In maintaining it the judges acted in the only way
that is open to men who are sensitive to a later verdict of history." In
the same paper, Louis Untermeyer called the Pisan Cantos "a ragbag and tail
end of Pound at his worst. It shows a very disordered mind, one affected by
the seeds of Fascism," and Robert Hillyer thought the award "regrettable"
for aesthetic rather than political reasons. "I never saw anything to
admire, not one line, in Pound." [ . . . ] Robert Frost, in a memorandum to
his secretary Kay Morrison soon after the award was announced, called it
"an unendurable outrage" and Pound "possibly crazy but more likely
criminal." [ . . . ]

Huntington Cairns, in his journal, described one of his visits to St.
Elizabeths. "I saw Pound for an hour on Saturday, Feb. 19th. The director
of the hospital had informed him that he had won the Bollingen Prize, and
he was obviously excited by the news. He had prepared a statement for the
Press: 'No comment from the Bug House,' but he had decided not to give it
out.  [ . . . ]  Walter Winchell quoted Pound's comment on the same
occasion: "Democracy is more stupid than ever I said it was." Tate,
incensed, asked Pound's wife to check on that. "Total lie" was Pound's
answer. He called Winchell a "Jewish bedbug." [. . . ]

For a time, controversy over the prize subsided. It was suddenly revived
when the Saturday Review of Literature, in its issues of June 11 and 18,
published two long articles by Robert Hillyer - "Treason's Strange Fruit"
and "Poetry's New Priesthood." Hillyer, earlier a professor at Harvard (his
students Howard Nemerov and Robert Fitzgerald remembered him as a gifted
teacher), won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1934, and in 1939 was
president of the Poetry Society of America. [ . . . ] Hillyer was regarded
by many of his literary peers as an isolated figure who had carried on a
long critical campaign against Eliot and Auden, whom he regarded as his
poetic rivals. During the late spring, Evans and Adams had had letters from
Hillyer and from Harrison Smith, the editor of the Review, putting
questions about the award. Hillyer's were marked by a threatening tone,
with insulting references to conspiracy and negligence. The F.B.1. had been
alerted, he said; and an article would be published. [ . . . ]

In his two articles, Hillyer declared that the Cantos are "the vehicle of
contempt for America, [of] Fascism, anti-Semitism, and . . . ruthless
mockery of our Christian war dead." He implied that the award was part of a
conspiracy against American ways of life and literature, and that the
conspirators included T. S. Eliot, Paul Mellon, Jung, the Bollingen
Foundation, Pantheon Books, most of the Fellows in American Letters,
admirers of Eliot and Pound, the New Criticism, and various literary
quarterlies. Their common aim, he argued, was to seize power in the
literary world and undertake "the mystical and cultural preparation for a
new authoritarianism. . . . In a spiritual morass where language, ethics,
literature, and personal courage melt into something obscure and formless,
a guided impulse has stirred the amorphous haze into something approaching
form, something shaped out of stagnant art by groping Fascism." [ . . . ]

On June 24, Congressman Jacob K. Javits, of the 21 st District, New York,
wrote Evans: "After having read the editorial 'Treason's Strange Fruit' . .
. I am particularly concerned about the awarding of the Bollingen-Library
of Congress Award of $1,000 to Ezra Pound. I would very much appreciate
your advising me how the Fellows who make this award were chosen, who they
are and the basis of their selection." [ . . . ] On July 19, another
congressman, James T. Patterson, of Connecticut, addressed the House
regarding the award ("Should we encourage the activities in literature of
moral lepers?") and inserted into the Congressional Record the Hillyer
articles, Evans's letter, and the Saturday Review's reply. On the
twenty-first, Javits called for an investigation ("Must we not be equally
diligent to investigate the infiltration of Fascist ideas especially in so
august an institution as the Library of Congress?"), and the matter came
before the Congressional Joint Committee on the Library of Congress, whose
chairman was Senator Theodore F. Green, of Rhode Island. What transpired
was not an investigation but a resolution, on August 19, to the effect that
the Library should abstain from giving prizes or making awards. ("I think
it is a bad policy for the government to give prizes and awards, especially
in matters of taste," the Senator told the press.) Evans immediately
announced compliance. The awards that the Library discontinued, besides the
Bollingen Prize, were the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Medal for "eminent
services to chamber music" and three prizes endowed by Lessing Rosenwald in
connection with an annual national exhibition of prints.

In that same feverish summer of 1949, William Carlos Williams was also the
object of a small cloud of protest, raised by his review of the Pisan
Cantos in the spring issue of Imagi, a very small poetry quarterly
published in Baltimore. During July, Evans received a few letters, all
alike in content, protesting Williams's appointment as Consultant in Poetry
- evidently the result of confusion with his appointment as a Fellow
earlier in the year. Some of the letters came from the editors of other
small verse magazines (in Arkansas, California, etc.), saying for example,
"That [Williams] should defend such a work places him in the same category
with Pound, that of utter contempt and treachery to all the ideals for
which America stands. . . ." [ . . . ]

After the prize was barred (and $9,000 returned to the donor) the Bollingen
Foundation received a number of requests from universities to carry it on.
In early 1950, the Yale University Library was granted the funds to
continue making the awards. The winner of the 1949 Prize, selected by a
committee whose members - Adams, Aiken, Shapiro, Chapin, Warren - had all
been Fellows in American Letters ]at the Library of Congress], was Wallace
Stevens. [ . . . ]

In 1963 the amount of the award was increased to $5,000, and thereafter it
was given every other year. After 1968, when the Bollingen Foundation ended
its programs (except for the Bollingen Series, which it gave to Princeton
University Press to carry through its publication), the Andrew W Mellon
Foundation took over, and in 1973 made an outright endowment of $100,000 to
enable the Yale Library to continue awarding the prize in perpetuity. By
now [1988] more than thirty poets, including many of the Consultants, have
received the Bollingen Prize. They keep coming on.

Cowley to Tate, October 21, 1949: "I went to a literary tea for Nehru.
Present were the editors of the Saturday Review... Harrison Smith saw me
and advanced beaming. 'I was going to write and congratulate you,' he said,
'on the article about Hillyer. I think you had the right dope. Of course,
we just printed the Hillyer articles and the editorial to start a
controversy. It was a great success. We thought it would give us three
exciting issues but it went on for six.'

Here is the status of resurrecting the wr-eye-tings list:

1.  I've got a solid volunteer to host the list who's already set up to do
this.

2.  I've configured my own mail server to do this in case something goes
wrong.  (I would just go ahead and host the list myself, but my volunteer's
Internet connectivity is better than mine.  I'll announce the name of our
rescuer with grateful thanks when we've got everything set up.)

So we have a new home in the wings for wr-eye-tings.  It's *quite likely*
you will have to resubscribe.  Please stay tuned for an announcement, which
should come in the next few days.  In the meantime, please be patient.

If you happen to know someone that you know is subscribed to wr-eye-tings
but is not on the Poetics List, you might pass on the word that wr-eye-tings
is down but is being reconstituted.

Duration Press is seeking to develop a web page dedicated exclusively
to Small Press Announcements.

This list, which will be updated every two weeks, will give interested
parties a one stop place to look for recent publications.

As the list is updated, Duration Press will also house an archive of
previous lists, in order to give readers a kind of bibliography in
process of small press publications.

This list, of course, will depend upon the participation of both
readers & publishers.

If this sounds like a resource that anyone would be interested in
seeing, please send all comments to Jerrold Shiroma at
three7@earthlink.net .

Hopefully the response to this will be large enough to warrant
constructing this resource.

All best,

All this talk about submitting to poetry journals reminded me that I am
collecting horror stories involving work sent to academic (peer
reviewed; critical) journals.

I'm giving a paper at the mla on the not very exciting topic of
simultaneous submissions. Anyway, I'm the pro person the panel--arguing
that the reviewing practices of academic journals are filled with abuse
and simultaneous submissions might be one way to force journals to
reform.

I'm interested in collecting stories (academic journals only; not poetry
or small press journals). Please back channel them to me. If I were to
refer to your story in the paper, I would approve it with you and
respect any sort of privacy that you might desire.

Thanks.

how much authority is enough? where do you buy this commodity? how do you
get the others to listen? where did Eliot Weinberger come from? why wasn't
he here to begin with? what's fear worth these days? which poem are you
referring to? what's your favourite of all the poems you don't read? can we
talk Tennyson? how long did it take you to find out? who's out now? where
are the boundaries? which one's the boss? who cares? when did all this come
down? who's in charge of these words? who owns the owners? which credential
do you prefer? what's your idea of relief? what part of death is not
necessary? where have you been all day? what's the best way to get out of
here? can you find a better route there? behind who should you hide? at what
point will you know that you have won? are you as ready as you need to be?
are all circles the same? can we question questions? will there be time
later? who should we turn to? does the perimetre change? do we? are you

Sorry, John(s).

We became aware of the other Aus Salt sometime after starting
the NZ Salt. We did toy with the idea of changing names, but didn't
want to risk confusing our rather small (even by NZ standards)
readership, and supposed that our readerships weren't overlapping.

The Animal


It's fifty years from now and there's this one animal left. It doesn't
matter what you call it, where it lived. It goes on now by artificial
means, intravenous feeding, automated evacuation. It has nothing to look
at, maybe its eyes are clouded over.

The animal stands there, it's recorded from every angle. Temperature, even
radio-radiation, audio, video, hologram, old quickcams and 4x5 plate cam-
eras, everything they could think of. Terabytes of information flow out
through thick cables, documenting its every move, it shuffles.

On and on and on, into huge computers, they take the information, alter
it. Suddenly there are recreations of tropical forests, African savannas,
Pennsylvanian hilltops, deserts at night. The animal's reconstructed as
wolf, ibis, snake, spider, bear. Now everyone can see the wildlife through
the glasses, through the screens, through implants. The animal turns in
its sleep, even the animal has to dream. Walls, nothing, the placement of
a foot. Overhead, screens, birds soar, shimmer.

The tail of the animal, maybe, the whiskers.

Bob Hass is on a roll in his Washington Post Poet's Choice column. He
follows last week's piece on Fanny Howe with this one on Lee Ann Brown:

http://search.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/1999-07/18/049l-071899-idx.ht
ml

Like some other folks I know, he doesn't quite get the seriousness of her
endeavor, but his good will is evident throughout. Also, the boy's a little
unclear on Tender Buttons. That was a book, Bob, not a prose poem.

I don't think this is a fair reading of what I wrote.  Perhaps, if you'd
like a new angle on this, you can imagine writing a story with your friend
from the Poconos as the protagonist, and when quoting him in the story not
use quotation marks.  You, as most of us, would be very frightened to do
this because you would wonder if a reader would think these were words
reflecting your own opinions or personality.  But nonetheless this is what
a lot of modernists did, I guess because it was supposed to be an
unmediated representation of objective reality, which in the scientific
spirit of the day was a primary goal.  Of course, if you don't think your
friend from the Poconos is worth literary immortality you wouldn't write
the story at all, but then again you wrote this post, so your friend,
racist or not, was somehow useful.

When I was a little kid we used to vacation at a cheap resort in the
Poconos, which were a lot more remote before the construction of I-80 than
it is now. I became close friends with the owner's son who had a black
German Shepherd names Nigger. I don't think he'd ever met a Black person,
but I don't doubt for a minute that he and his family were racists. But
maybe when he called his dog he was feigning a persona.

It was a pleasure to see two successful "men of letters" approaching 50,
John Yau and Charles Bernstein (& yes Charles I mention your name publically
here, in attempted good faith, as "psychic payment" for your private praise
of a point or two I made at the L(R)J conference!) present at the reading
of Gary Sullivan and Nada Gordon this sunday at the Zinc Bar. It was a little
sad to see not too many others there, but I don't want so much to "lay
the guilt trip on those who didn't show" as proactively promote, a la
that Game Theory song "sleeping through heaven" which is fun to sing to
others....

Anyway, it was no mere reading but a, from this distance, true
collaborative dialogue between these writer/lovers (lover/writers) that may
serve as the beginning of a much needed (at least in NYC poetry scene)
attempt to dissolve, as much as possible and desirable (or at least
intensely toy with, and be toyed by) the barriers between
the "political" and the "personal"
the "aesthetic" and the "ethical",
the "elliptical" and the "straightforward"
the "public" and the "private" etc.
(i sacrifice rhyme and rhythm for analogical significance here)

What gary and Nada seem to be embarking on is a couragous attempt to render
explicit, through a dramatic embodiment, many concepts that are
ostensibly touted and/or embraced by the "avant-garde" but whose
"products" so rarely achieve, or at least reveale, the symbiosis that
occurs both between two people "in the throes" as it were as well as between
those "blue poles" of "life" and "art". What G and S suggest is that there
may not be able to be a connection between two people unless there is
also an attempt to connect life and art, without subordinating one to the
other, except theatricaly (in moments) of course, within the conceptual
frame of endless possibility in the context of monogamous (for the time
being, in the "nest phase" at least), but otherwise "nontraditional" love...

This was the first (of what I hope will be more) public performance of
these young(ish) artist/lovers, and the content of their poetic epistles
(and nada's acapellas, which would be even better, i'd argue, with
musical--say, piano--backup) has not yet, for me, eclipsed the sense of
the sheer radicalness of the concept Gordon and Sullivan propose....

To emphasize the conceptual aspect (frame?) of their work is not meant to
be taken as derogatory. The courae it takes to include a
computerized-voice reading of un-obscene pornography (more tabooed in
"avant-garde" scenes allegedly more on the grunds of its lack of
linguistic innovation than for any anti-pleasury ideology aeshetic or
ogery), for instance, among the most abstract and/or lyrical of musings,
for me, takes on a conceptual significance that not only challenges
community standards of "good art" but also raises the question of whether
anti-desire aeshetics, or an art-for-art's-sake attitude and behavior,
may NOT simply "make nothing happen," but rather, dangerously, widen the
gap between art and life, and highten alienation...

Because Gary and Nada's work (dealinating too first name from last name)
is groundedin the feeling and idea of an all-emcompassing eros (although
that love is not its only ground), it may seem to provide an exemplary
contrast to other so-called conceptual artists.
For instance (see Village Voice, July 6, 1999 article by C.Carr), the
situationist-influenced young "performance artist" Christine Hill, whose
thought-provoking meshing of 'everyday commerce' activities and art have
been gaining some attention recently. According to Carr, "Hill's work
really blurs the art/life line because it's about creating something that
IS life. She has worked in the past as a masseuse, waitress, shopkeeper,
and lead singer in a rock band--activities she desginated as ART while
they also provided an income..."
Hill thinks of drawing and painting as "apprentice skills" and she is out
to create situations, not objects....
Sullivan and Gordon, however, don't seem to conceive of writing as
"apprentice skills" but rather allow for or encourage actively more of a
symbiosis, and in this sense I'd argue go beyond Hill (So, maybe Deitch
Projects or the Public Art Fund could fund them too!)... Unlike Hill (and
lacking her hard-nosed practicality, one might argue), G and S are not as
interested in eradicating the aspect of the life/art dichomotomy that
makes it such a difficult challenge to "unite one's vocation and
avocation" (to paraphrase Frost's wistful hope without a net...)> What
they do for money, their public role outside of their role as a "couple
of writers" (in the highest sense of that phrase) is not emphasized. One
could imagine, perhaps, an art attitude that combines these two distinct
ways (Hill's and G and S's) of blurring or eradicating the life/art
distinction, but perhaps this is too much to ask, or perhaps the
difference is best unbridgeable.

(more, to be continued, in next post quite shortly....)

Hill, as an individual artist, chooses to present herself theatrically as
an installation piece (as TOURGUIDE and Used-clothes proprietor, etc.,
giving "new meaning" to the convention of the "studio visit"), in ways
that may be compared to the largely individualist ethos of, say, Annie
Sprinkle (sex or at least breasts being more like business than like love),
while Sullivan and Gordon, at this phase at least, by challenging the
idea of the individual, and the objectification of the other, or of the
self for that matter, by becoming mutual muses for each other, and
bracketting the economic exigencies and mediations that inform (and even
drive) Hill's role-playing, create a conceptual art that meshes poetry
and life in a way that can move toward undoing some very stubborn
either/or dichotomies that, through compartmentalization, either reduce
the tension to a manageable working partnership, or make it more
impossible to love (depending on one's definition of), live. Because N
and G write to each other directly, they not only discover (and invent?) in
each other a form capacious enough for all modes of writing, but they
also find in all modes of writing, a way to embrace the tradition of
(love) poetry, of lyric and discursive, or even fragment/aphoristic
singularity while also challenging it by more inclusively putting it
in dialogue WITH dialogue--a dialogue that can only become MORE dramatic,
even as the realtonship may seem to stabilize (freer the tighter)....
If there seems something too utopian yet about their perfomance (if they
ignored, for instance, my request to include more of their verbal "fight
scenes" in this first public performance), this is not to be condemned,
or even merely tolerated and swept under the rug by being judged by the
standards of 'safe art' as 'mediocre' if judged by 'literary' merits....
You have to start somewhere, and the myth of true lovers, or even
"soulmates" that may "transport" each other, though certainly partaking
to some degree in fiction (and surely hokey to the embarrassed or
embittered), is at least as fitting a place to start as any (especially
against a backdrop of a model of profit and loss which may perhaps
contaminate many potential loves).
They should be given the poetry teaching jobs!
Or at least be made examples in polemic arguments that wield more
cultural authority, or institutional sway, than mine
(if I was "talking policy" with "the big girls" say)...
Ah, when is a joke not a joke....
So,Hail Gary Sullivan and Nada Gordon, .......

It's good to be reminded from time to time why I don't mind having been
such a bad graduate student.
I don't think I ever suggested that complex thinking about anything is ever
out of order, nor that Williams was uniformly a bad man. I am suggesting
that to understand is not necessarily to forgive. Perhaps especially if one
is a member of the victimized group.
Here, by way of illustration, is a story I heard from a friend not five
minutes ago. His ex-wife, with whom he has a passably friendly
relationship, had their two young children last night. He gets home late to
an hysterical message on his machine: the kids had awakened in the middle
of the night to find themselves alone. This morning he discovers that the x
had gone out to a bar because she needed some adult company. It's a hard
time for her--she just broke up with her guy, and her father, to whom she
was very close, just died of cancer. She's usually not that irresponsible.
Easy to understand her situation as complexly as one likes, not so easy to
forgive.
And I did all that without reference to a single philosopher.

I've been following the thread on Williams/Pound/anti-semitism with great
interest.  My current research focuses on African-American poetry from
about 1945-1955, and many points being made on the list touch on issues of
concern to me.  I was glad to see someone (Peter Neufeld) finally
correct the earlier error--Pound did indeed receive the Bollingen and it
ignited a substantial controversy.  John Tranter's quotations from
McGuire's book were especially interesting.  I spent some time last summer
looking through the Cleanth Brooks papers at the Beinecke--letters from
Allen Tate to Brooks show that there was deep contempt for Hillyer at
Kenyon and among the New Crit poets--and Tate encouraged Brooks to write a
letter, which he did, attacking the SRL for even printing Hillyer's
editorials.

But what I'd like to ask the list members--and I've already asked H-AMSTDY
and AFAM-L about this, with no luck--is if anyone knows of any response to
the Pound debate among African American writers of the period.  I'm
familiar with the Pound/Hughes connection (and I've studied the letters
from Ez to Hughes at Beinecke)--but does anyone know what other writers
were saying? Did Wright, Ellison, Dodson, Hayden, Brooks, etc. comment on
this?  I couldn't find anything on it in major black periodicals of the
day (*Negro Digest*, *Crisis*, *Phylon*).  But am I overlooking something?

Thanks!

There was a movement to revive Hebrew.  I am not sure about Washington,
but others, such as Ezra Stiles at Yale, did consider Hebrew absolutely
essential as the divine language (Hence the Hebrew in the Yale coat of
arms).  The Book of Revelations figured into all millennialist
calculations -- and even most deists were millennialists.  The typological
identification of America as the New Israel goes back to the original
English settlers and the notion traveled through all sorts of religious
and secular paths, along with the doctrine of Jewish restoration
(advocated by Tom Paine, for example).  None of this is Jewish -- rather,
the protestant adaptation of covenant identity to settler-colonial
purposes, as was done, in different ways, by Scotts-Irish in Ulster,
Afrikaners in South Africa, and (later and in not characteristically
rabbinically Jewish ways) by Zionists in Israel.  Even, in some ways, by
Americoliberians in Liberia.  All of this is complex and thorny.  I
write about it in more depth in my forthcoming book "American Palestine:
Melville, Twain, and The Holy Land Mania" coming out in November.  Indeed,
American is a creation of the rum trade -- but also considerably more than
that.  The covenantal mentality is still very much with us -- as "American
Dream" and in other more explicitly religious ways, with both good as well
as a lot of bad results.  William Carlos Williams is no exception -- which
is why "pure products" are so crazy.

I'm not sure I understand what you're saying. Williams is more than any
modern poet the source of my own development as a poet, so I guess I think
he's useful. And the boy in the story was my best friend. I don't think
either of them were being ironic in expressing their less savory attitudes.

Fascinating. Thanks for sharing this. And to think I was debating about this

Michael:

I'm not sure where you get the notion that Marx ever had such a
reductive, binary view of the Self's possibilities. Your quote from
Dewey (who was very much his own person, but no enemy, really, of
materialism) is actually a nice encapsulation of Marx's general
outlook on the human condition, an outlook elaborately laid down
early on in _The German Ideology_  --and foreshadowed for the first
time in a substantial way (how's this for ironic complexity?) in his
"On the Jewish Question," an anti-Semitic essay on the "problem" of
Judaism:  For Marx, famously, "Consciousness does not determine life,
but life determines consciousness."  From Marx's standpoint, there
are no metaphysical essences or unities involved with the human
subject... Correct me, please, if I'm misreading your intent.

In any case, there is no desire on anyone's part, so far as I can
see, to avoid thinking as "complexly" as you on this Williams
issue (look at all the complex and fascinating posts on this
thread!). It may be old-fashioned and simplistic, but some of us do
honestly feel that there is sometimes certain evidence that resists
deconstruction. And the evidence in this case shows that Williams was
afflicted with the virus of anti-Semitism (a term you've claimed
"says nothing") and coughing rather loudly. Honestly, Michael, it
seems to me that you have launched into a "complex" theorization of a
problem without first coming to full terms with the problem's
existence. And to appeal to the "multifarious and multimotivated"
nature of the individual subject (the full, complex, and
contradictory flowering of which, by the way, was Marx's vision of
the free human being under communism) doesn't really shed that much
light on our topic: Pat Robertson is multifarious and
multimotivated too, and Dewey would obviously not desire the good
name of his pragmatism deployed to obfuscate a particularly
pernicious manifestation of that man's multifariousness! Nor would he
want it deployed, I'd bet, to water down a particularly noxious
manifestation in a master poet like Williams.

I only know the exchange between Gary Sullivan and Nada Gordon
through the excerpts printed at East Village Poetry Web. But I've
seen enough to wholeheartedly second Chris Stroffolino's very fine
appreciation. The work is totally new and idiosyncratic in the
greatest of ways. In Sullivan's case (I don't have sound, so can't
hear the Gordon videos) it's a bit, as I take it, like Dante on
Dexedrine.

Or something hard to explain like that. Truly something.

Hello all,

Way back at the beginning of the thread on William Carlos Williams, before the

Kent, your critique of my post below is fair enough - particular with
regard to my giving Marx short change; quick notes on vulgar Marxism,
though I would still say that Marx, as a teleological thinker, can't
possibly accomodate the variety of subject positions that, say, a William
James can, for better or worse.  Certainly Lukacs has real anxiety
regarding any sort of fragmented or multifaceted Self - because it
complicates the whole issue of intent (and I wouldn't want to read Lukacs'
quote out of its very specific post-WWII context).  Anyway, I suppose at
this point this is neither here nor there: we're going to disagree a bit
about Williams, is the upshot.  What I would prefer to look for in
Williams are the many, many instances in which his symbolic activity
unravels the whole logic of anti-semitism: doing so allows me to 1) bring
that anti-semitism to light; 2) suggest methods by which it might be
critiqued; and 3) stay in keeping with my own thinking on the issue of
Selfhood.  That's not so bad a way to approach things, is it?

Michael, I'm guessing that Ellison would have said, sure, give it to him -
though I've never come across a specific staement on his part, I know he
dug at least the early Cantos and ABC of Reading.  There's a fascinating
exchange in his 1977 interview w/ Ishmael Reed, Quincy Troupe & Steve
Canon (which incidentally, contains some discussion of anti-semitism, with
Ellison deftly reminding the younger guys of "those contributions to civil
rights and cultural improvement through which Jews play an important and
liberating role") where Pound comes up in a discussion of Melvin Tolson.
I don't have time to quote it in full but it basically involves Ellison
describing meeting Tolson when he was in High School, his subsequent
friendship with him, and their discussions about Pound and Eliot.  It's in
CONVERSATIONS WITH RALPH ELLISON (Jackson: UP of Miss., 1995), p. 370.

last night at the weekly APG meeting Mark Prejsnar said something very close
to this (my apologies if i've inadvertently misquoted);

"poetry is the use of language that always extends outside the margins of
whatever can be explained by theory....you see after years of doing poetry
and poetics i've discovered that i'm much better at poetry than poetics and
so this is a definition that sort of justifies that... and i really sort of
believe that too... you know i was listening in my walkperson to some poems
i'd recorded of Ray di Palma's and Coolidge and some other folks and what
they were doing seems to bubble up past... to exceed the boundaries of any
one explanation---and that's what makes it good poetry... that's why you
want to read it again and again."

that thinking about it today
i'm going in multiple directions

on the one hand
i completely agree with what mark says here
which i might rephrase as
        ~great poetry
          cannot be
          compassed in
          an explanation~

but in my other hand
there is a dispute
as for me this quote of mark's
makes assumptions
about the nature of theory
that i don't really share
  (while i do recognize that for most folks the word denotes what almost
amounts to a genre-unto-itself, a game even, in which the theorist deploys
terminology upon a text in an effort to show both how perceptive they are
and how the text "does not know itself" but is instead a site wherein forces
that sport within the superstructure conspire and clash, controlling and
dictating what is and is not inscribed therein - for the most part
yawningly)
instead (as i've tried to say here in the past)
i see most everything we do
as the consequences of theory
whether of the unconsidered
or considered variety

so around comes my third hand
where i have the following idea
that rather than us being able
state either proposition
   > that poetry exceeds theory, or
   > that theory exceeds poetry
to the exclusion of the other
that they have to both be true

and so digging back in this regress
 (three hands makes it go quicker)
we move back from the poem
to the theory(s) that it slips
out of the grasp of
but which also allowed for the toeholds
on which it ascended
and this strata of theory must
be seen to have evolved out of
consideration of other things
 (poems, for the purposes of this riff)
which in turn exceeded their theoretic wombs
and on and on and
( . . . )
at some point it seems that the two
converge - that the making,
the poesis, is the making of
both poems and theories

further i wonder if
this isn't still the case

if poetry isn't always
embodied theory (or poetics)

if it isn't we
who've ignored that
to the extent that we've let the word
 ~theory~
become synonymous
with a very delimited and extraneous
mode of totalizing discourse


alas,


sad

glad

For anyone who's interested, here's an excerpt from my dissertation on the
Objectivists (University of Virginia, 1997) which may speak to some of the
questions that have been raised in relation to Williams lately.  The point
I would want to make, again, is that even, or rather especially, when we
are looking at a phenomenon as disturbing and oppressive and destructive
as the twentieth century's horrifying legacy of anti-Semitism, it's
important to make distinctions.  And when we're looking back at a
particular historical moment, it's important to recognize the distinctions
that were made at the time, the one's that constitute that moment's
historical complexity.  Thus, when I used the term "complexity" in
relation to Williams, I had in mind not some "multifariousness" of the
self that would absolve one (i.e. Williams) from being held accountable
for one's actions and beliefs, but rather the complexity constituted by
Williams's specific historical and personal situation.  A situation that
includes, as others have pointed out, William's own ethnic background, his
particular life experience (as, for example, doctor to the immigrant
poor), and what we might call Williams's own "map of culture.  It's my
view that Williams *is* concerned with this sort of mapping, and I think
the key text is probably *In the American Grain*, though there's much to
be gleaned from the poetry too.  The excerpt below starts with a reference
to Williams's "Elsie" poem, then briefly discusses IAG and WCW's cultural
vision, then moves on to Williams's angry attack on Pound, written in the
early forties.  As I try to show, it seems to me that two fundamentally
different views of culture (i.e. Pound's and Williams's) are coming into
conflict here.  The full citation for Williams's important but
little-known essay on Pound is "Ezra Pound: Lord Ga-Ga!" *Decision*
(1941): 16-23.

-------------

        The poem's central figure, Elsie, "reared by the state" and "sent
out at fifteen" to work for "some doctor's family" (presumably
Williams's), is able to lay ironical claim to the title "pure product of
America" precisely because of the "dash of Indian blood" that contributes
to her mixed pedigree.  In Williams's theory of American culture, which is
in direct conflict with Pound's cultural ideal, miscegenation is the
American version of purity.  The "ungainly" and tormented Elsie
"express[es] with broken / brain the truth about us" (107).  In keeping
with this view, James Clifford reads this poem and its central figure,
Elsie, as emblematic of the "ethnographic modernity" characterizing
twentieth-century culture.  As Clifford observes, Williams is writing from
a stance "off center among scattered traditions," as he is compelled to
occupy a "truly global space of cultural connections and dissolutions"
(4).  But Williams also identifies the resistance to Elsie's "truth" as
central to American culture.  By the time An "Objectivists" Anthology was
published, Williams had already elaborated this point at some length in
the poetic prose of In the American Grain (1925), which, like the poems
before us now, conducts an examination of American culture, often based on
a writing through of the documents of American history.  In the American
Grain develops a view of American culture that values efforts toward
"contact," while criticizing the culture's pervasive fear of the immediacy
of "touch."  This fear of touch, in Williams's analysis, is closely
related to fear of the ethnic "other":  "Do not serve another for you
might have to TOUCH him and he might be a JEW or a NIGGER" (177).
Further, it is especially tied to the fear of miscegenation:

Do you realize the fascination of the white woman who had twin nigger
babies has for us?  They accused the woman of having had intercourse with
the apartment's colored elevator boy.  Her husband abandoned her at once,
of course,--charming man.  But you know Mendel's law; they discovered
there had been a darky in his family six generations before!  Be careful
whom you marry!  Be careful for you can NEVER know. (177)

In Williams's reading, Mendel's law of genetics is something like a law of
American culture.  It will do no good to deny our hybrid nature as
Americans because, in time, even our most "recessive" traits will out, our
deepest cultural secrets be revealed.
        History, then, must acknowledge the importance of cross-cultural
contacts:  "History must stay open, it is all humanity" (189).  The
problem with conventional history, according to Williams, is that it
"follows governments and never men," "portray[ing] us in generic patterns,
like effigies or patterns on sarcophagi" (188).  In contrast to Pound's
"great man" theory of history, Williams's emphasis on the individual is as
likely to figure forth an Elsie as a John Adams.  Like Reznikoff's,
Williams's revisionist histories would be written from the ground up.  In
An "Objectivists" Anthology, these "grounded" histories serve, through the
mechanisms of ideogrammic juxtaposition, as critiques of Pound's approach
to history and culture.  Indeed, Williams's criticism of history would
have as an offshoot a related critique of Poundian aesthetics, and
politics, that is directly relevant to our concerns here.
        This critique took shape over a period of decades, but didn't
receive full expression until 1941, when Williams was outraged to find
that he had been mentioned by Pound during one of his radio broadcasts
from fascist Italy.  Williams's response took the form of an essay
entitled "Ezra Pound: Lord Ga-Ga!"  in which Williams argued that during
his exile in Italy Pound's foolish tendencies had undergone "an apotheosis
at the hands of a bigger fool than he," i.e. Mussolini (16).  Pound was
now "a case for the psychiatrists," but his insanity was "the result of
deficiencies, long apparent to his friends, that have finally overthrown
him" (16).  Williams's diagnosis delves far back into Pound's character
and behavior, drawing on theories Williams had been formulating for some
time.  He begins by applying his own "touch" thesis from In the American
Grain.  "I have often observed that in certain sensory areas," Williams
writes, "Ezra Pound completely lacks perceptivity" (17). In Williams's
reading, Pound is a kind of child prodigy, a "spoiled brat" like "all
those bright boys and girls who enter college at the age of twelve and . .
. go mad soon after reaching puberty."  Outside their field of specialty,
Williams claims, such geniuses tend to "go astray,"  and to "fall back on
authority" (17).
        Pound is indeed a "great poet," "one of the most gifted the New
World has produced," but "his great force came from the narrow
restrictions of his mind--giving it impact, but, alas, at what a cost"
(17).  For Williams, "All Pound's perceptions are literary and if taken as
such have their value"; but again, there is a corresponding, and
overwhelming, deficiency: "What he lacked was a knowledge of man, plain
and simple" (20).  In his desire for a system of "rule by the few" (20),
Pound,

. . . has never had any love for or understanding of the people
themselves, the great leaven of the world without whose tonal tides to
support them all men become tyrants and beasts in the end.  Ezra had no
inkling of such matters, the starved and the defeated, nothing but
complete contempt for them.  He merely wanted to replace the lying,
thieving rule by his own 'enlightened' one . . .  (21)

Williams is writing, in 1941, out of a direct concern with the danger of
fascism, the danger that "all men [might] become tyrants and beasts in the
end."  The specific object of his critique at this point is Pound, the
man, but before long this analysis brings Williams to a remarkable
meditation on the opening of Canto XXX, which has already concerned us
here.
        The Canto is introduced as Williams moves from discussing Pound's
generalized contempt for "the people" to examining his enmity for specific
ethnic groups, particularly the Jews.  At this moment, Williams introduces
Pound's "Compleynt,"  just as Zukofsky had presented it for consideration
nine years before in the pages of An "Objectivists" Anthology.  "Pound,"
Williams observes, "has written some of the loveliest verse of our century
of which not any has more haunting beauty than the opening lines of Canto
XXX" (22).  Here Williams quotes the opening of the "Compleynt," drawing
particular attention to the lines "Nothing is now clean slayne / But
rotteth away."  Williams observes:  "It is a fascinating theme and a
magnificent poem representing, I think, Pound's main philosophic tenet"
(22).  This tenet, in Williams's summary, runs: "Keep what is 'good,' keep
what is lovely.  Let all that is ugly be clean slain".  Since much of the
"world today" is "sloppy and mushy in its very essence," it must be "clean
slain, slain--done away with, killed, slaughtered as were the Spanish
rebels."  This slaughter is an act that would, for Pound, be "about of the
same nature as the drainage of an obscure swamp in Africa or the Amazon"
(22).  Again, the allusion is to Mussolini's swamp-draining exploits, as
well as to fascist Italy's role in the bombing of Spanish rebels during
the Spanish Civil War.  Williams has no difficulty making a direct link
between Pound's "Compleynt" against Pity and real-world acts of political
violence.   He attends to the formal beauties of the poem-as-object, but
reads it also in relation to "the dialectical necessities of its day"
("The New Poetical Economy" 269).1 The conclusion to which Williams is
brought by this dialectical reading is that Pound's plaint expresses
nothing less than the desire to "kill all democracy" (22).
        As the essay continues, it becomes clear that Pound's "Compleynt"
is an important crux for Williams, that he has read the poem many times,
and meditated on it over a period of years.   He sees the poem as a kind
of key to the dilemma of "how to read" Pound which has continued to
perplex so many literary critics.  Williams wonders whether the poem's
"secret" is perhaps "a pleasure and a pain equally balanced which we
cannot resolve" (23).  "[T]he beauty of the poem is death," Williams
concludes, and what is at stake is "the body of humanity . . . in all its
multiplicity and obscurity . . ." (23).  For Williams, the resolution of
Pound's dilemma requires "perceptions of which [Pound] is largely
incapable, humilities which he cannot know" (23).  Williams's critique of
Pound, and his poem, involves a fundamentally political reading that
circles back to Williams's criticism of conventional history and the
inter-ethnic fear haunting American culture.  As Brian Bremen has argued,
Williams's approach to history develops an aesthetic insisting on "the
continuation and development of struggles for mutual recognition" (198).
Or as Williams put it in In the American Grain, the crucial insight--with
the "body of humanity" hanging in the balance--is that "We are, too, the
others" (41).

appreciation. The work is totally new and idiosyncratic in the
greatest of ways. In Sullivan's case (I don't have sound, so can't
hear the Gordon videos) it's a bit, as I take it, like Dante on
Dexedrine.

Or something hard to explain like that. Truly something.

Mark,
I first heard of the Washington/Hebrew/American national language thing from
an Israeli; we were both standing in the shadows of the largest
free-standing statue of Elvis Presley in the world, just west of the suburbs
of Jerusalem.  Subsequently I heard the same bit several times more, both in
Israel and across the river, in Jordan;  quoting it seemed most to be an
attempt on the part of various opinion-holders to ground the legitimacy of
Israel as a sanctioned state in the previous preference of a person of
stature (what DID Elvis stand on Israel anyway?).  Now I see viz Hilton's
recent post

that the Washington version may be some sort of rough metonym for the more
detailed report Hilton DOES supply, luckily for me, since I was rather stuck
on your comment re: Washington's being a Deist, as if that made some
difference in the both larger yet still local (& locateable) "millennarian
&/or escahtological imperialist" scenario.
& I do recognize that the American "Revolution" wasn't just slugging it out
over a pot of molasses and a glass of Jamaican rum.

& no, I'm not "saying that everything is the same and no differentiation is
possible."  I'm saying that SAYING THAT "everything is the same and no
differentiation is possible" is very much the matter of state & media
sanctioned "plurality" in which nothing is "the same" because it's all
plural (sounds like some kind of semantic problem to me), ie., "the same".
Look at what's called the Global Economy - what IS it?  Or more essentially,
who's it FOR?
It seems an essential question, especially in light of the contest this List
also takes part in, ie., what the new riddles are, who will fix them, what
the fix IS, how one may get in and/or out of them.

Ugly politics are still what poets have to operate in, if not "out of".  If
good art permits of ugly politics, how good is it?  If  poetry is thought to
be some kind of all-encompassing cross-weaving of the subjects and objects
of THIS world, yet disavows it for the referentially pointed and possibly
parallel THAT one, how does one keep the "stretch" of it "clean"?  Via some
sort of critical yet perpetually generous "spirit"?  & who's to the good for
it?  Ie., where's the community?  Is it limited to the ardent hearers of
this, and LIKE, "lists"?

Anyway, thanks for your substantial additions/corrections, Hilton, if you're
there; I look forward to your book.

When Peter Balestieri advises that it's a bonus to hear Linda Darnell sing:
In gambling halls laying, 10,000 cattle straying.  It reminds me to draw
attention to the song (recorded by Peggy Lee with Benny Goodman's band) in
which she sings: I am as gay as a Disney cow.  Anyone remember that one?

The deadline for submissions is July 31, but the statement struck me
as extremely interesting, even entertaining, so thought I would
forward. Susan Howe mentioned here, John Tranter and Jacket, the
"illegibility" of "American excess," etc.

                POETS ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                Edited by Anthony Mellors & Robert Smith


                The deconstruction of nostalgia for transcendent
                identity is crucial to international poetry working
                out from modernism. If, for example, the work of
                Andrea Zanzotto, Allen Fisher, and Susan Howe centres
                on locations saturated with national myths (the
                Veneto, London, New England), this is not in order to
                romanticize the poet's identity with the place or to
                envision universal truths from a local microcosm.
                Rather, each of these poets takes the immediate
                environment as a place crossed by divergent histories,
                perceptions, and ecologies which are traced as partial
                evidence, inviting readers both to attend to the
                difficulties of the text and to pursue their own lines
                of inquiry. Even in the case of Zanzotto's
                psychoanalysis of pastoral identity, no
                subject-position is evoked which remains
                unquestionable.

                However, although this kind of poetry has a wide and
                dedicated audience, it is far removed from what most
                readers and literary critics today regard as the
                appropriate form of contemporary verse. Late modernism
                is post-modern in the sense that Lyotard makes of the
                term: a critical reworking of the procedures of
                modernism. But postmodernism has acquired another
                meaning, which has gained general currency: the
                outright rejection of modernism as being idealist,
                elitist, reactionary, inaccessible, and irrelevant. If
                postmodernism means the breakdown of distinctions
                between high and low forms of culture, late
                modernism's formal difficulty puts it squarely in the
                high culture camp. Post-modernist poetry, on the other
                hand, turns away from avant-garde experimentation.
                Instead, it reestablishes the lyric voice, either
                through ironic parables of the self or as the
                expression of multicultural identities. It endorses
                the local, the particular, even the provincial, as the
                representation of vital if marginalized communities,
                and it does so without the modernists' desire to
                sublate the regional into a unified humanist locus.
                Value is placed on the lucidity and directness with
                which the poet communicates, allowing readers to
                identify with representations of their own community
                or to empathize with others. Poetry is a means - one
                among many - by which local identities protect
                themselves from the homogenizing power of the culture
                industry.

                In this light, poetry which suspends identification
                looks as if it has never managed to break free from
                the Coleridgean belief in a clerisy of readers only
                able to grapple with the dialectics of the text
                because highly attuned to the history and theory of
                poetic forms. In a world where marginalized voices are
                fighting for recognition, late modernism stands
                accused of evading its democratic responsibilities.
                Far from inspiring readers to engage with questions of
                identity and difference, these barely legible texts
                could be said to encourage resignation and
                indifference in anyone except those who are well
                educated and already disposed towards the 'difficult
                matter' of modern art. In contrast, postmodern poetry
                claims humanist inclusivity without the rhetoric of
                aesthetic unity. It aspires to what Simon Armitage and
                Robert Crawford call in their recent Penguin anthology
                'the democratic voice'.

                This new poetic democracy is not without its
                theoretical and institutional problems. Postmodernism
                argues for the irreducibility of experience, its
                essential difference from community to community. Yet
                in this context it requires that all experience be
                rendered in an identifiable form. In Britain, for
                example, poetic legitimacy is associated with a deeply
                ingrained suspicion of 'foreign' influences, so that
                even where regionalism is valued it tends to be
                invoked as a populist defence against European
                experimentalism and American excess. And it is not
                always clear whether a poet's work is given as
                regional or radically marginal because it engages with
                the linguistic and political pressures of
                non-centralized identity, or simply because the poet
                has a tenuous association with a marginal site. In
                _Devolving English Literature_, Robert Crawford wants
                to affirm the virtues of 'provincial' writing against
                what he sees as a dominant and exclusive metropolitan
                culture; yet his preferred exponents of regional
                identity tend to be poets who, although having Welsh,
                Irish, or Scottish family origins, are granted
                cultural legitimacy by conforming to the only poetic
                'voice' acceptable to metropolitan publishing houses
                such as Faber: an ironic lyric style relatively
                untroubled by the translatability of language or
                personal experience and endorsing aptness of metaphor
                as the fundamental mark of poetic value. Crawford's
                provincial/metropolitan opposition is itself bogus in
                that it elides the problem of complicity: the notion
                of the provincial is an invention of the metropolitan
                bourgeoisie, and its use calls into question
                Crawford's ability to analyze the politics of poetry
                beyond a centralist point of view. The position here
                is both metropolitan and imperialist in that
                'provincials' become the subjects of sentimental
                regard as long as they communicate in the accepted
                terms; otherwise, they are ignored or denounced. The
                marginal is invited into the mainstream or preserved
                as marginal value by the mainstream only when it gives
                up its attachment to difference.

                For late modernists, on the other hand, difference
                cannot be translated, only approximated. The poem is a
                construction which makes the reader aware that every
                translation is an appropriation. It could be argued,
                however, that the implied reader of this poetry is
                just as 'metropolitan' as Crawford's democrat. But,
                while the two positions are not as clear cut as our
                description suggests, they do represent fundamentally
                opposed views of poetry's function in modern society.
                For what we are calling late modernism, poetry can
                only become a radical force by resisting consumer
                culture and its appeal to the 'short attention span'
                of its audience; for postmodernism, poetry can only
                prevent itself from being marginalized or completely
                ignored by competing with more marketable forms of
                cultural production. While the former continues to be
                reviled by the mainstream publishing houses and
                literary organs as too rarefied to be of popular
                interest, the latter is itself beginning to fall foul
                of market pressures. The current hoo-haa over Oxford
                University Press's axing of its poetry list shows that
                the mainstream is somewhat more marginal than its
                proponents have imagined.

                Even so, poetry is flourishing as never before through
                public readings, small publishers and magazines, and
                via the Internet. Although these networks might be
                said merely to affirm poetry's marginalized status in
                an era of global markets, they nevertheless lay claim
                to the cultural value of independent means of
                production. (A modern irony being that small-press
                material has frequently out- sold 'major'
                publications.) And, if these networks originate from
                local or marginal groupings, they are anything but
                narrow in their reach. They have inaugurated a new
                internationalism in poetry which goes some way to
                confound the old coteries and critical demarcations.
                The use of new technology has revitalized traditional
                media by lowering production costs and has created
                alternative forms of distribution. Australia, for
                example, has become a new poetic centre. Through
                magazines such as John Kinsella's _Salt_, James
                Taylor's _Boxkite_, and (on the Internet) John
                Tranter's _Jacket_, it has increased international
                recognition for Australian writing while creating
                strong links with poets in France, Britain and the
                United States.

                The aim of this issue of _Angelaki_ is to collect a
                wide range of critical essays addressing the current
                state of international poetry. We invite contributions
                addressing the general questions raised above, and we
                hope to encourage debate about the history and
                ideology of modern poetic forms and institutions. Far
                from being taken as read (which is unlikely
                considering the partisan nature of the subject), the
                remarks made here should be seen as the springboard
                for argument and clearer definition. The issue will
                also include new poetry.

                "Since its inception in 1993, the journal _Angelaki_
                has established itself as a leading forum of
                theoretical reflection, providing a practical
                refutation of all those who would celebrate 'the end
                of theory.' Whether it is focused on thematic issues
                of the most varied nature, introducing thinkers to
                English-language readers, or treating a variety of
                problems in open issues, _Angelaki_ challenges the
                complacency of the self-evident. Required reading for
                the next millennium." Samuel Weber

Hannah ok the setting. i'm releasing it now under the imprint LOOK!!

Hi Mark,

Not to drag this on, but it seems to me this story is unrelated to what the
context of my ideas were earlier.  I'm don't see how the naming of a dog,
and the eventual calling by its name and what light this sheds on the moral
make-up of a family, has anything to do with sitting down and writing a
short story, a modernist one no less, which involves a plethora of
aesthetic and strategic issues that are simply overshadowed by this
connection -- why reduce?  I think just dumping a discussion of Williams
into this anecdote is too easy, besides being poorly thought through (more
important than the names of philosophers would be a clear goal and
consistency in thought, especially in such a thorny realm -- and what makes
you think I would have been better treated than that family, which you hold
before me as an example of my ignorance?).  I am certainly not an apologist
for Williams -- he's much better messy and flawed, but you seem to imply
this by your last sentence, with has a certain acidic tenor which I deemed
"unfair," and still do because you used sentiment to guide an opinion
regardless of the content of my post and those it was responding to.
Consequently, I don't know what your jibe on "feigning a persona" has to do
with what I wrote since I didn't write about personae, nor about "feigning"
one (which is kind of impossible, people usually "adopt" a persona, or
"feign" a personality -- "feigning a persona" would put you two steps
behind the surface).  I was talking about words and sentences, the "many
origins" to misquote Olson, and not "irony" (there's a bit of negative
capability thrown in there also, I guess).

Anyway, I'll happily retire from this one.  Just wanted to clear that up --
it's implicit in the previous post, I think.

Yours,
Brian

Finally, and after several false starts, I've been able
to access this account for more than a few minutes at a time.
I anticipate that this means the Poetics List will be able to
resume as of now, with the caveat that incoming messages sent
to the list may be delayed somewhat, and that backchannel
correspondence certainly will be, for the next few days. Your
patience has been and continues to be appreciated - especially
as the list was interrupted in the midst of some rather
interesting discussion.

If I understand Hilton correctly (Hilton, are you there?), the _secular_
use of the Book of Revelations was more as an available source for rhetoric
supportive of a very different kind of millenarianism than the descent of
chaos/reign of the saints/end of time kind. I'm willing to be corrected if
I didn't get it. As to Washington's preference for Hebrew as a national
language, I've yet to be persuaded and would need chapter and verse.

Look, this discussion is about the kind of antisemitism that has an
attitude towards "those people," one's friends always implicitly or
explicitly exempted as "not that kind of." It allows for certain choices in
ones fiction that I think would not otherwise occur to one. This I think
unexamined attitude is of course very different from and less destructive
than Poundian antisemitism, but it's the kind that American Jews in the
present in more or less civilized places are most likely to encounter.
Which is why it continues to be disturbing to some of us.

Maybe my thinking was shoddy, or maybe we're talking about two different
things.
I retire from the field.

Tisa (& all), There's a guy named Sergio Rizzo who's written some
interesting stuff about Williams and black women in 2 different but
related essays:

1) "The Other Girls of Paterson - Old and New" in WCW Review 20.1 (Spring
'94)

2) "Can 'Beautiful Thing' Speak?: Race and Gender in Paterson" in
Deese/Axelrod, eds., Critical Essays on William Carlos Williams (NY:G.K.
Hall, 1995).

Black women had a pretty profound influence on Williams from childhood to
old age, - it is, not surprisingly given all we've been saying lately
about him, a vexed but interesting connection.   -m.

If every poem embodies "a theory" (or, a poetics).... I have no prob with
that, i guess.

I meant (and am still most concerned about) poetics in a fairly formal
sense.  Which might be defined by example:  Pound's and Zuke's theoretical
statements, a work like Marginalization of Poetry or CB's A Poetics; or
the old L=A=N=G essays by various hands collected in the Language Book.

Just because i ask myself if i should try to clarify my practice ( and my
thoughts about others' work) by doing such formal writings, or not...

JL, you are sort of shifting the terms so that you and i are talking about
*somewhat* (tho not entriely) different things... (or so it seems to me..)

This might be made clearer by rephrasing what i said:  poetry reaches
beyond the analytic grasp & explanatory ability of any given *piece of
writing about poetics*.......

About your point, i only have one small objection:  a poetics, or
theoretical approach, may lie (in fact, i agree:  *does* lie) behind any
given poem.... But because the poet often works from inside the materials
and movement of her work, she is often not very conscious of or concerned
with what that underlying poetix is.  Not in any way that she could (or
cares to) articulate.  That's not so much an objection as a qualification.
It can be very good and helpful for her, sometimes, if she *is* aware of
her underlying poetix.  But fab work gets done by people who don't think
much about thier underlying poetix at all.  It can work either way,
depending on the poet and the project...

Brian,

I'm intrigued by this idea of feigning a persona as opposed to
adopting one.  Adopting one sounds like putting it on proudly, even
buying into it.  Feigning one reminds me of those endless social
occasions when I've known what kind of persona was required but I
couldn't buy into it, didn't have the heart to fully embrace it, or
was lacking in the social skills to pull it off.  In those instances,
I'd say that feigning a persona would be much more appropriate a
category.  An awkward ineffectiveness.  Cocktail parties come to mind
as a dangerous site.  Also much of the humor on TV sitcoms, not that
I watch them enough to be an authority.

In writing, too, I think this comes up.  Kathy Acker's personas, for
instance, their delightfulness is in the sense of feigning rather
than adopting.  Pathos unbalancing power.

When I hit reply to all in Eudora, the speech function kicked in for
some reason and my computer started reading your message outloud to
me in this mechanical reverb voice.  Creepy, but appropriate somehow.

It was a matter of those wooden teeth.  Surely Washington would have
felt the glottal fricatives they entailed would blend in better with
Hebrew than English.

Well, not exactly. I agree that:

The work is not the man.
The prize is not the man.
Therefore, the man is neither the prize nor the work.

However:
The prize is the both work and the man.
There has to be work to be a prize; and, by implication, there has to be a
man (or woman) to be work. The ratio of man to prize increases in relation
to how "political" the selection criteria are.

In general, I feel that ethical considerations of the writer's life should
be entirely separate from considerations of the work--not that ethical
concerns shouldn't be considered, discussed, dissected, etc., just that they
shouldn't be seen as germane to the work. At all. A close-up of anyone's
life reveals multiple layers, "selves" and contradictions--the study of
personality is an interesting one. However, in the case of a writer, their
biography is merely another footnote, and maybe a totally misleading
footnote at that. A critique of the work, on the other hand, is much closer
to the writer's "self."

RE: I am suggesting

I agree with this, and in the case you posit below, it holds true, but
sometimes it's very difficult to separate these two things, don't you think?
In fact, implied in "I understand" is a forgiveness of sorts. There are many
things that can never really be "understood," not least of them the
holocaust. In order to understand a hateful behavior we have to go into
internals--motivation, intention, etc.--and if we can't match these with
anything in our own self-understanding, there's little chance of
"understanding" the other.

I still think the drive to "understand" WCW by means of biographical
revisionism is, in fact, in order to forgive him, so that our enjoyment of
his work can be undiminshed by his anti-semitism. I just don't think it's
necessary to accomplish this, to forgive him, in order to appreciate his
work.

Or, maybe it's just a hero-worship thing--a need to "clear the name" of a
beloved icon.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Arcturus Editions is proud to announce the publication of:


Pat Reed: CONTAINER OF STARS


artwork by Marianne Kolb
ISBN 0-9661505-2-X
$10.00, 4 7/8 x 7 1/2, 28 pp., printed letterpress using handset type on
Mohawk Superfine, with Thai Unryu endpapers sewn in Fabriano Tiziano covers
$20.00 signed edition, lettered A-Z
Publication Date: August 1, 1999

Culled camping in the Sierra Nevada, her perception pared to precise sound,
the syllables of Pat Reed's poems spill effortlessly down page, a stream that
"opens the blackness."


Pat Reed was born in Los Angeles and has lived in the Bay Area for the
past twenty years. She is the author of six books of poetry: _Sea Asleep_
(Coincidence Press, 1983), _More Awesome_ (One Dog Garage, 1985), _Qualm
Lore_ (One Dog Garage, 1987), _Kismet_ (O Books, 1990), _Tangle Blue_ (1993),
_Dawn Walking Shoes_ (1996), and a prose memoir of teaching refugees in East
Oakland, _We Want to See Your Tears Falling Down_ (literatura de cordel,
1996). She currently teaches at Hayward State University.


Swiss artist Marianne Kolb has lived in the Bay Area since 1983. She has
exhibited in the U.S. and in Europe since 1991 and is currently represented
by Hang Gallery in San Francisco. Primarily a painter and printmaker, she
often changes medium and scale in her work, and at times will drop all other
tools to draw with stick & ink. Two ink stick drawings were created for
_Container of Stars_.



"From the author of the deft sprawl of _Kismet_ comes a 'poking / through the
/ black grid,' a mellow rounded ear of absence, then 'fish whump' or 'Giants
shift'-- a causal puzzle of clustered stanzas abutting the natural world.
Enjambment quickens and slows the eye-word 'VERY STILL' -- can't escape --
the locale-specific, transportative function of this beautiful clear work."

               --Steven Farmer



"Absolute (f)act of attention to word enactments of events in world; what
happens when one stops to see and/or hear 'it' taking place in the 'out
there' that is also an interior experience of being inside solitude of
exterior land(e)scape; feeling registered as the sounds of syllables in the
air/ear ('I sit still / in my tent / by the river // filling my ear / with
cold going') -- Pat Reed's _Container of Stars_ bears (re)reading, again and
again."

                --Stephen Ratcliffe

Subject:      $3.50: Summer vacation in Scandinavia!
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

I think I've discovered where poetry might be, had there never been a
"Wasteland" to set us back 30 years!  With the recent interest in
international poetry demonstrated by such publications as Boundary2,
readers should grab up the chance to check out the oddities transpiring
in ~Scandinavia,~ in the latest issue of Samizdat (no. 3).  With English
translations of 10 little-seen poets from Sweden, Denmark, and Finland,
it's an opportunity to glimpse a sturdier branch of our same family tree,
effortlessly twentieth century, in a lineage spared the antagonistic
influences of American confessionalism with its counter-reactions.  The
surprise of it is a kind of unselfconscious modernism which escapes
the sometimes deforming pressures of obligatory experimentation.  Even
Nordic Europe's "conservative" strains seem to derive from an unfamiliar
lyric tradition (unfamiliar to American readers) which remains startingly
without recourse to our lyricism's "I"/"you" axis.  What informed English
or Romance poetry these poets do explicitly evoke (Lawrence Durrell,
Valery, and Char in Gungerd Wikholm;"My Interview with I.A. Richards",
Perry Miller, and an Auden epigraph in Anglophone Goran
Printz-Pahlson) may sometimes seem quaint, but its spottiness and
lacunae have spared them the weight of the Bloomsian patrilineage we
suffer, all for the better.  All the same, it's interesting to find Eliot that far
north: "But think also of . . . the lonely typists in their immaculate rooms /
with a small fridge and biscuits on the mantelpiece" ("My Interview").
(That quote may be unrepresentative, though, as even the same author
could coin such fine peculiarities as "intestines of the heuristic house"
[!].) Overall, they have no compunctions about blithely changing direction
mid-stream in their poems, yet without that petrifying into an imprisoning
literary trope like formal "disjunction."  A flourish of Pop can turn up, as
in Printz-Pahlson's "The Enormous Comics," which flaunts as much
Superman and Katzenjammer Kids as a Kenneth Koch poem, except
here Superman is a ~transvestite.~  Curiously, Scandinavian modernism
also seems to have grown up without the facile vernacular imitators
took from Williams Carlos Williams, and the pleasant formality that results
meets the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E '90's halfway, insofar as they too, if
pushed to it, may "hate speech."  For instance, such linguistic
materialities as: "And the language will arrive at last / We do not know
what's first", "The vortex of our language / in the greater vortex;
through its eye---" (Goran Sonnevi), "Stuck in his back pocket, a book
with gleaming covers / . . .  start at what page?" (Jesper Svenbro).
There's a good share of nature imagery, --- a relief, in this July weather
--- but there's a lot of wilderness up there, and, while perhaps a trace
of Symbolisme adds a cool mystery to such "yellow leaves of the
birches, the red leaves of the rowans", it's equally realist in its
occasional specificities: "drop by drop / down the whitewashed wall
and the bulging gauze-wrapped sewer pipe / to come out first as rust"
(Soren Ulrik Thomsen).  Here's how far from transparency it can go:
"gridiron reverberations / in the hills, sourmash / blandishments . . . As
the ~gavroche~ innocence of a barnyard rape: // He offers a smile, mild
/ as pick-axe handles a / mile wide which kindles/ the hide of rutabegas"
(Printz-Pahlson again, whose English language originals, translated into
Swedish, have "on occasion" been translated back into English,
according to the editor's introduction).  I lived in Sweden when I was a
teenager, so I can swear to you: those "sourmash / blandishments"
keep coming and coming.  (Followers of this EPC discussion list will also
be glad to hear from our own Masha Zavialova, lone list-er throughout
continental Russia, in her "Word from Russia": she reports on their first
prize for independent writing, the covetted Andrei Belyi Prize for
literature, where the award is a bottle of vodka and one ruble.)

The info is: Samizdat / 14 Campus Circle / Lake Forest, IL 60045.  Single
copies of current/back issues: $3.50.  Subscription: $10 for three
annual issues.  Checks made out to editor Robert Archambeau.

 What better time than now, while summer sunlight lasts well past
midnight there?

Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

I alluded a few days ago to an exchange between Pound and WCW.
Here is the passage I had in mind, from Eliot Weinberger's long essay
"The Modernists in the Basement and the Stars Above" (truly a
stunner, in many ways), found in _Works On Paper_ (New Directions):

Pound, letter to Williams, 1936:

 jews having been circumcised for centuries/ it must have had some
 effect on the character. [...] history is written and character is
made by whether and HOW the male foreskin produces an effect of
glorious sunrise or of annoyance in slippin backward. Someone
diagnosed Shaw years ago by saying he had a tight foreskin/ the whole
of puritan idiocyis produced by badly built foreskins. Criminology/
penology shd/ be written around the cock. The dissecting room shd/
lay off that chaotic bucket of sweet breads from the skull and start
research from the prong UPward. The lay of the nerves/ etc. This
doesn't blot out endocrinology/ but it is the fount of aesthetics/
means microscopic attention/ disssection and micro/ photographic
enlargements/ killers etc/ shd have their prongs photoed postmortem.

 Williams' reply:

 ...if cutting off the loose hide over a few thousand years has
 altered the Hebrew character-- I doubt it. By all the laws of
heredity it should have affected the women and they are as bad as the
men today, or worse. It ain't the skin that makes the difference in
the man, its the stick in it that does it.

http://www.eskimo.com/~rstarr/poormfa/poemtool.html

You'll also find a Perl program to do diastic reading on that page. And,
last but not least, I have a web page that does diastic reading (I made the
Perl program into a CGI script ). So, you can go to

http://www.eskimo.com/~rstarr/poormfa/diastic.html

type in your key/title phrase, paste in your text, click a button, get the
diastic text, and not use anything other than your browser.

There are also links to Taylor Brady's Word macros and other things that
other folks and other sites pointed me to.

Happy computed writing.

Five poems by the Bolivian writer Jaime Saenz (translated by myself
and Forrest Gander) are just up at Jacket #8.

Hope some of you will take a look at this very interesting poet.

--------------------------------------
Jaime Saenz (1921-1986) is Bolivia's leading writer of the 20th
century. Prolific as poet, novelist, and non-fiction writer, his
baroque, propulsive syntax and dedication to themes of death,
alcoholism, and otherness make his poetry among the most
idiosyncratic in  the Spanish-speaking world. As the author of one of
Latin America's first openly homosexual novels, the as yet
untranslated masterpiece Felipe Delgado, Saenz's work also stands as
a singular example of artistic and personal courage. His poetry is
collected in eleven books (including a volume of selected
      work), the first of these published in 1955 and the last in
      1984. The poems presented here are taken from the collection As
      the Comet Passes (1982). They are the first published
      translation of Jaime Saenz's writing in English and part of a
      book manuscript of selected works.

Vito Hannibal Acconci


She was an ordinary girl from a nowhere place. She came to Hollywood to
make it big and I knew her back when, way back when her name was Carrie.
Carrie was sixteen and just about as sweet as they made them, and back
then they made them sweet. You could take one look in her eyes and know
that was innocence talking and you'd never be the same. I once saw her
stop traffic with her voice; I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see
it myself. The cars just pulled right over. She sang her poor little heart
out. You'd take one look at her and you'd know she wouldn't last. You'd
take her in and take care of her and ask for nothing back. She would have
given you everything in the world, you thought,and she made your heart big
as all outdoors. I saw the sun rise in her eyes and I thought I'd see it
set, too, but it didn't. Everyone knew she was doomed to failure and
everyone worked hard to make sure she never failed.

I'm an old man now, I could tell you stories, she'd still remember me, it
was just last year I heard she died, I gave her the best parts of my life,
I can still see her then, you wouldn't believe such innocence, her smile
brightened my life, sometimes I hear her call me, I turn around thinking
she's there, I remember her like the day I was born

Camp KPFA was torn down by police at 4 am. According to Friends of KPFA, 6
peoeple were arrested, among them KPFA leader Kahlil Jacobs-Fantauzzi.

Kahlil was taken to Santa Rita prison--isolated from all of the other
supporters arrested, who were taken to local jails. As of 11:45 am, he had
not been read his rights and was uncertain of what they plan to charge him
with. When he asked what he was being held for, an officer resonded "for
being a jerk." He has been denied his requests for vegetarian food, and has
been ignored in his requests for writing materials. According to those he has
contacted from the prison, they do not plan to release him until he posts
bail. The amount has not yet been determined.

This is a strategic attack on the leadership in this struggle! Kahlil and all
those arrested during this struggle need our support!

What you can do:
1) Attend the march/rally TODAY at 5 pm, Ashby BART Station in Berkeley.

2) Attend tonight's Berkeley City Council Meeting at 6:30 pm.

3) Attend the hip hop event at 8 pm at La Pena.
        And march back to the station at 12 am.

5) Camp out! Help us re-establish camp at KPFA. Bring cameras to record what
you see. 1929 MLK Jr. Way, Berkeley.

6) Call all local media and demand that they report on this. We need critical
watchdogs!

Background:
The Story thus far . . .

Like every organizational crisis, KPFA's began with an incident. The
overwhelming response to that incident revealed that, throughout the Pacifica
community, thousands of people were deeply troubled by network's lack of
democratic process.

On March 31st, 1999, the Pacifica Foundation's Executive Director Lynn
Chadwick
informed KPFA general manager Nicole Sawaya that her job with the station had
been terminated, effective immediately. Chadwick told Sawaya that she was not
a
"good fit." The Pacifica Foundation, a non-profit organization, manages the
affairs of five non-commercial radio stations throughout the United States.
KPFA
was the first; started in 1949, it is the oldest listener supported FM station
in America. Sawaya's ousting came two weeks before KPFA's fiftieth
anniversary.

The firing revealed an utter disregard for the first and most obvious rule of
community radio: major policy decisions will be made in consultation with the
community. Pacifica management talked to no one beyond its own inner circle
before taking this drastic step. A strong, independent minded leader, Sawaya
was
very much liked by KPFA's staff and the larger community. Her ousting
provoked a
huge wave of protest from KPFA supporters across Northern California.

That night KPFA's news department prepared a report for the listeners about
the
sad decision. To the astonishment of the staff, Pacifica told the station's
news
director not to run it. The story was broadcast in defiance of the order.

Even before Sawaya's dismissal, however, Pacifica was clearly moving in an
alarming direction.

On February 28th, the Pacifica National Board met in Berkeley and decided to
remove Local Advisory Board (LAB) members from its national governance board.
Local advisory board are the backbone of community input into Pacifica
national
policy. They meet once a month and hear the concerns of listeners,
volunteers--
whoever has something to say. Formal LAB member presence on the national board
helps keep Pacifica accountable to the network's stations. Now that LAB
members
were gone, Pacifica's national board became a completely self-appointing
body.

KPFA's signature voice, Larry Bensky, appeared before the National Board to
argue against this decision. Bensky is a 30 year veteran of the Pacifica
network, having won the Polk Award for his historic gavel-to-gavel coverage of
the Iran-Contra hearings in 1986. Bensky warned the board that Pacifica's
National Office was becoming unaccountable and top-heavy with staff. When
Pacifica terminated Sawaya as general manager, Bensky became even more worried
about a management style that had now become autocratic. He took his concerns
to
the listeners on his regular Sunday program.

On April 9th, Pacifica responded by firing Bensky as well.

The coup strategy was now obvious to anyone who cared to look: centralize your
authority, remove from any position of governance those who seem like they
might
question you, and fire your critics. These actions came from an organization
whose flagship daily public affairs program is called "Democracy Now," and, in
its own literature, refers to Pacifica as "democratic communications."

The KPFA community, outraged, took to the streets. For KPFA's listeners and
staff, "democracy" is more than a word you put on a mass mailing to get
someone
to send you a check. Over 800 KPFA supporters demonstrated against Pacifica in
front of the KPFA building on March 31st. On May 9th, 2,000 demonstrators
gathered at Berkeley's Old City Hall to protest Pacifica's intransigence. It
was
the biggest listener demonstration in the history of community radio. KPFA's
staff began airing regular public statements, demanding the reinstatement of
Sawaya and Bensky and calling for the independent mediation of the dispute.
The
station's listeners responded by making KPFA's May/June subscription marathon
the most successful in its history: 6,200 pledges made "under protest" of
Pacifica's actions.

An ugly incident took place, and Pacifica used it against KPFA's paid and
unpaid
staff. Late on the night of March 31st, someone fired gunshots into the
Pacifica
national office headquarters. No one was hurt. After years of defending the
free
speech rights of anyone and everyone, Pacifica has sometimes crossed paths
with
fringe groups. Frightening but thankfully infrequent moments like this have
been
the price. Most of the time it has been station staff who have braved the
dangers and threats.

But this was the first time in the organization's history that Pacifica used
the
event to hire on-site security guards. They were placed not in front of
Pacifica's offices, where the shooting actually happened, but inside KPFA's
studios. Lynn Chadwick then appointed herself general manager of KPFA. On
Monday, June 22nd, a delegation of about a dozen people came to Chadwick's
office to talk to her about her policies. They were led by a member of
Berkeley's City Council and a Catholic priest. Chadwick used this event to
justify the hiring of armed guards -- grey-suited, professional security
gunmen-
-to watch KPFA's staff.

Chadwick even denied KPFA staff access to door security codes. An organization
founded by pacifists--World War II era conscientious objectors--was now under
lockdown at gunpoint.

Even before it had gotten this bad, Pacifica claimed its third victim. Robbie
Osman had been a music and commentary programmer at KPFA for over two decades.
So effective and influential was Osman's regular Sunday program that the great
folksinger Kate Wolf wrote a song for it: "Across the Great Divide." Osman had
for years been troubled by the direction Pacifica seemed to be headed. He
actively spoke out against Sawaya's and Bensky's firing on his program.

On Friday June 18th Pacifica's national office cancelled his show, dispelling
any doubts about the Brave New Pacifica they have in mind: a rigid, top-down
organization where policy will be made by a group of people who can be counted
on the fingers of one hand--with digits to spare. The following Sunday, KPFA
broadcast silence when Osman's regular program would have been aired. Outside,
demonstrators protested the firing.

Pacifica has tried to justify these actions by claiming that they want to
bring
greater diversity to the network. But KPFA's minority staff haven't bought a
word of it. "KPFA's African American programmers will not be complicit in any
Pacifica-driven purge of KPFA staffers under the guise of 'diversity'," a May
21st letter signed by 13 programmers declared. Scores of voices across the
progressive community agree. Mumia Abu-Jamal, Alice Walker, Dolores Huerta,
Noam
Chomsky and many others have called upon Pacifica to practice what it preaches
every day on Pacifica radio: There is no way to democracy; democracy is the
way.

KPFA's community is united as never before to save the spirit and reality of
commuity broadcasting. The nation's community of community radio knows that
the
future of democratic broadcasting in America will be decided in Berkeley. Keep
your eyes on this website and your ears to KPFA for further news about how you
can help us all win.

Network (Temple Univ Press, 1999)

Following is a collection of paragraphs of detail on volcanic Pacifica v KPFA (et al.) battle.

                *

Is anyone present at or around University of Pennsylvania? A useful thing would be to scratch up
action there (perhaps inform the campus paper, or talk with active or left faculty) to get Dr.
Mary Francis Berry's  (who is a professor there) actions “on behalf of radio listeners” into
light.

                *

The survival of KPFA WBAI KPFT (the last hasn’t survived, actually, has been essentially killed,
now runs NPR feeds and has been reduced from an 8- to 1-language broadcaster of wasp garbage
thanks to Dr. Berry’s regime) et al would be a more likely thing right away if it weren’t for the
fact that Dr. Berry, Pacifica Foundation Chair, is also Black & the head of the US Civil Rights
Commission, and big pawn of the White House and Democrat Establishment, and is, according
grapevines of the left, merely one puppet in a classic behind-curtain cabal of Corporation for
Public Broadcasting / White House / CIA ? / Corporate Radio (there are at least 4 corporate
broadcasting entities who have stated on record they’d be interested in purchasing, to the tune of
70ish million, KPFA’s channel at 94.1, or, barring KPFA’s, WBAI’s.

Dr. Berry has enlisted support of many “powerful” individuals and entities by claiming that her
mission is to integrate KPFA, “a bastion of the White,” agit-snow-bullshit cover that has been
debunked by all in opposition, most notably the allied staff of color of KPFA, unanimously.

You can read in various media of her (and Lynn Chadwick’s [Pacifica executive director])
disgusting tactics of oppression of KPFA staff and listeners, since roughly March, however I will
mention that a nearly ultimate KPFA-death step has been achieved today with Pacifica’s placement,
assisted by protective goons, of wiring KPFA’s transmitting so it can broadcast whatever it wishes
via KPFK in Los Angeles (whose manager is a dictatorial ass at the feet of Pacifica, and has both
threatened KPFK staff with “discipline” should they mention the debate on air or, even, “outside
the station”).

Today, yesterday, and so forth, when one tunes in to KPFA one hears gelatinous music or
rebroadcasts of talks.

For full information on all facets see, above all:

www.savepacifica.net
www.radio4all.org
www.counterpunch.org






As a pre-postscript: Pacifica & Micheal [sic] Palmer [sic] (CEO of CB Richard Ellis of Houston,
one of the largest corporate real estate firms in the world &, strangely, the Fascist to thank for
anemia at KPFT), as well as the Justice Dept and select liberal jackoffs, know they have the most
dutiful and excellent puppet Dr. Berry, and have moved step by step with such force and
heinousness as to only mean a decided endgame of purging KPFA’s staff and “reprogramming.” (Berry
is on record with this agenda—her aim is to affiliate Pacifica’s five big stations with National
Public Radio. We’d then have, as “public radio” in America, a thousand stations simultaneously
broadcasting the Sickly White Soundz of those eleven men who all sound the same and provide no
information, no dissent, and Terri Gross, who would drool on a pile of excrement if it had a name
badge on it and a mic near its face).

(We’ll have, in a few years:

“Fresh Air is supported in part by Monsanto, supporters of social justice & progressive
agriculture since 1890”

and

“All Things Considered is brought to you by Eli Lilly, Inc., makers of Prozac, using Nazi research
to drug all of America since 1947, and major benefactors of the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, whose
monies have been accepted and spent by such notable poets as _________________”



Please note that very recently the National Board of Pacifica voted amongst themselves, without
notice, and behind closed doors, as it were, to also abolish any local power, i.e., input of local
staffs, listeners, and advisory boards, and to vest the Pacifica National Board exclusively the
right to make any all present or future calls.




I have a suspicion not a great many “left” artists are actually politically active outside the
politics of their artmaking, but a handful of letters calls or emails by a group of them or you to
the numbers & addresses that follow would yet add to the powerful dissent, which, in a totally
controlled and drugged American society, is, en masse, the only popular phenomena that politicians
respond to.




* * * as of this note, word is that Amy Goodman, host of Pacifica’s most listened-to program,
Democracy Now!, is now! having her shows censored directly each morning, in advance of airing, by
Pacifica. (She had been neutral, though last week at last aired a 40-minute segment on “the
crisis”; that Democracy Now was pulled from the air at all stations save WBAI, where it is
produced, and because KPFA has been taken over by IPSA (former CIA, plainclothes, guncarrying
goons installed inside station by Pacifica), those listeners in the San Francisco Bay Area didn’t
hear it at all . . . and the man Mary Berry has flown in to “run” KPFA during the lockout is
Garland Ganter, a closet White-Supremicist who is, when in Houston, board Member Micheal Palmer’s
dog and human pliers at KPFT.)

BULLETIN: KPFA NEWSCAST INTERRUPTED...TAPES PUT ON AIR BY
            PACIFICA IN PLACE OF REGULAR PROGRAMMING


At 6:06 p.m. this evening, the KPFA evening news was interrupted
by background sounds of KPFA “Flashpoints” host Dennis Bernstein
protesting rough handling on the part of the armed security guards
who apparently were enforcing his suspension for material broadcast
on the air a few minutes earlier.

As news anchor Mark Mericle was describing the scene, his microphone
was abruptly cut off, and there was dead air for two minutes.
Then a pre-recorded speech (ironically, by Los Angeles activist
Eric Mann about Marxism and socialism) began to be broadcast.

THERE IS AN EMERGENCY DEMOSTRATION GOING ON AT THIS TIME...IF YOU
ARE NEARBY...PLEASE COME TO 1929 MARTIN LUTHER KING JR WAY IN
BERKELEY AND SUPPORT FREE SPEECH COMMUNITY RADIO...

AND FAX...phone...or e-mail Dr. Mary Frances Berry and the other
members of the Pacifica national board to protest their outrageous
actions!


_____________________________________________



I HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT PACIFICA IS PLANNING TO INSTALL A LINE TO THE
TRANSMITTER WHICH WILL ENABLE PACIFICA TO BROADCAST KPFK LIVE FROM LOS ANGELES ON TO 94.1.

AN EMERGENCY PROTEST HAS BEEN CALLED.  PEOPLE WHO CAN GET THERE ARE URGED TO GO TO BERKELEY, TAKE
CLAREMONT AVE. UP BEHIND THE CLAREMONT HOTEL, UP IN THE HILLS TO GRIZZLY PEAK BLVD., AND AFTER A
QUARTER OF A MILE, YOU SHOULD SEE THE ROAD LEADING TO THE TRANSMITTER AND PROTESTERS BLOCKING IT.

GET THERE!

UPDATE: PROTESTS CONTINUE AT KPFA, PACIFICA DENIES EXPULSION OF STAFF IS A LOCKOUT

LEADING CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS CALL FOR HEARING ABOUT PACIFICA FOUNDATION’S ACTIONS IN LOCKING OUT
STAFF,
CHANGING FORMAT OF KPFA, MISUSE OF FUNDS

BENEFIT CONCERT SCHEDULED FOR BERKELEY COMMUNITY THEATER
MONDAY 7/19 FEATURING JOAN BAEZ, DAR WILLIAMS AND OTHERS

(With apologies for missing a day of updates...our computer was down and we are all overextended
in fighting this dreadful takeover...)

l. Protests continued tonight (Thursday) outside the now padlocked and plywood-panelled facade of
KPFA and Pacifica.  Pacifica executive director Lynn Chadwick and her staff have apparently moved
out of their offices, possibly to downtown Oakland (a demonstration will be held there as soon as
their new address is verified).

    More than sixty riot-equipped police were present as the rally began shortly after 5 p.m.  By
6 p.m., the crowd had reached at least 500 people (there were over 2,000 the night before, but
there was less time to organize tonight’s...).  Several protestors tried to enter KPFA via a
ladder to a second floor balcony, but Berkeley police pulled them roughly inside.  Nine were
arrested, bringing the total to 77 arrests in protests thus far.

     A number of protestors said they would set up camp for the weekend.

     A hip-hop community rally in support of KPFA staff is set for 5 p.m. Friday in front of the
station.

     Pacifica states that the lockout is not a lockout, but paid leave for everyone at KPFA.

     Meanwhile pre-recorded tapes continue to be played by scab engineers. After failing to find
anyone local to take engineering control, Pacifica imported another KPFT employee, chief engineer
Bob Cham, to aid KPFT station manager Garland Ganter and Pacifica Program Service worker Mark
Torres from Los Angeles in broadcasting speeches and music.

2. Sixteen California legislators, led by Senate pro tem President John Burton and Assembly
Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa today released a letter requesting a hearing by the Joint Legislative
audit committee into Pacifica’s actions in this crisis.

    Noting that Pacifica is “incorporated as a public service tax exempt corporation in
California,” the letter expresses concern that Pacifica “may violate its charter and tax exempt
status” by disenfranchising local advisory boards and using fund for purposes inconsistent with
its charter.”

    In addition the letter cites the “lock-out of station workers” in violation of Pacifica’s
contract with Communication Workers of America.

    “When there are reasons to suspect that Pacifica is acting unethically or illegally, we
believe a hearing is warranted,” the letter concludes.


3.  A benefit concert for locked out and fired KPFA workers will be held Monday,  July 19 at the
Berkeley Community Theater, featuring Joan Baez and Dar Williams.  Ticket information follows
tomorrow...BUT PLEASE PLAN TO BE THERE!

4.  ARE YOU A UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE TEACHER?

    If so, you might want to send a letter similar to one sent by University of California teacher
Gray Brechin to Mary Frances Berry’s academic superior at the University of Pennsylvania.  ( see
http://savepacifica.net/0716_brechin.html )

 CONTROVERSIAL EMAIL RECEIVED DETAILING POSSIBLE CLOSURE OF KPFA
AS  LAWSUIT IS FILED TO  FORCE ACCOUNTABILITY COMMUNITY LEADERS DECRY CRACKDOWN

BERKELEY, CA - At a press conference at 1:30 p.m. today, Media Alliance  Executive Director Andrea
Buffa will release a controversial email she  received yesterday that describes plans by Pacifica
Radio to close KPFA  and possibly sell another Pacifica station, WBAI in New York. The email
appears to have come from Pacifica board of directors member Michael  Palmer.

“We are working to confirm the authenticity of this email and call on  Michael Palmer and Pacifica
Board Chair Dr. Mary Frances Berry to  immediately publicly confirm or refute this email,” Buffa
said.

Phone calls by Media Alliance and several Pacifica board members to  Palmer have not been
returned. Local Internet service provider IGC was  contacted about verifying the path by which the
email was sent to Media  Alliance. IGC’s tech services department has stated that the email looks
to have legitimately been sent from Palmer’s account. The full text of  the email is available at
www.zmag.org or www.counterpunch.org.

The press conference takes place immediately preceding a hearing at  Berkeley Municipal Court at
which charges will be filed against a group  of peaceful protesters who blocked the entry to
Pacifica Foundation’s  office in Berkeley last month. The demonstrators prevented Pacifica
Foundation Executive Director Lynn Chadwick from entering her office on  June 22. Chadwick
initiated a citizen’s arrest when Berkeley police  refused to cite the activists. Local community
leaders decried the  decision, calling it a terrible contradiction.

Meanwhile, a group of local stations’ advisory board members from Los  Angeles, Berkeley and New
York is pressing ahead with a lawsuit intended  to reverse Pacifica’s recent governance changes
that eliminated local say  on the national board. Oakland attorney Dan Siegel will file suit
within  the next few days to restore the last shred of local control at Pacifica:  the ability of
local station boards to recommend members to the national  board. Seigel will also attend the
press conference. “Pacifica, when  faced with the question of changing its method of choosing its
leadership, opted for the least democratic option imaginable. It is time  to revisit this issue,
and it should be unnecesssary to require a court  order to do so,” Siegel said.

Yesterday, Pacifica national board chair Dr. Mary Frances Berry arrived  in Oakland, told neither
staff nor listeners of her visit, and attempted  to negotiate with KPFA’s union leaders. Shop
stewards met with Berry to  remind her of her promise to meet with the KPFA steering committee,
which  both listeners and staff have designated as their representative, and  refused to negotiate
further.

KPFA paid staff, volunteers, local advisory board members, subscribers,  and listeners will
continue to press Pacifica to: 1) Rehire respected  KPFA station manager Nicole Sawaya, whose
termination touched off massive  protests in Berkeley and the firing of two veteran programmers
because  they violated Pacifica’s on-air “gag rule”; 2) Participate in mediation  and allow for
investigation of the dispute between local interests and  the national bureaucracy; and 3) Reverse
the disciplinary or adverse  actions taken against KPFA and Pacifica staff since Sawaya’s
termination.


* * *  scandalous & frightening email from Palmer is as follows (Pacifica spokeswoman Jackass
Fabri [total fascist & issuer of fraudulent press releases, varified in print authenticity of
email, accidentally [!] forwarded to Andrea Buffa of SF’s Media Alliance]):


From: Palmer, Micheal @ Houston Galleria, mpalmer@cbrichardellis.com
To: ‘Mary Francis Berry’, ma@igc.org

Hello Dr. Berry,

I salute your fortitude in scheduling a news conference opportunity in the beloved Bay Area
regarding one of the most pressing issues of our time............

But seriously, I was under the impression there was support in the proper quarters, and a definite
majority, for shutting down that unit and re-programming immediately. Has that changed? Is there
consensus among the national staff that anything other than that is acceptable/bearable? I recall
Cheryl saying that the national staff wanted to know with certitude that they supported 100% by
the Board in whatever direction was taken; what direction is being taken?

As an update for you and Lynn I spoke with the only radio broker I know last week and his research
shows $750,000-$1.25m for KPFB. There would be a very “shallow pool” of buyers for a repeater
signal such as this and it would be difficult to do a marketing effort quietly due to the shortage
of buyers. So there is no profound latent value to that asset. The primary signal would lend
itself to a quiet marketing scenario of discreet presentation to logical and qualified buyers.
This is the best radio market in history and while public companies may see a dilutive effect from
a sale (due to the approximate 12 month repositioning effort needed), they would still be
aggressive for such a signal. Private media
companies would be the most aggressive in terms of price, which he thinks could be in the $65-75m
range depending on various aspects of a deal. It would be possible to acquire other signals in the
area, possibly more than one, to re-establish operations, but it could take a few years to
complete if we want to maximize proceeds from the initial license transfer, or leave only $10-20m
in arbitrage gain when purchase(s) is complete. None of this reflects tax consequences. This
broker, just like any other that would undertake such an effort, would need certain agreements in
place prior to starting.

Mary I think any such transfer we would ever consider requires significant analysis, not so much
regarding a decision to go forward, but how to best undertake the effort and to deploy the
resulting capital with the least amount of tax, legal and social disruption. I believe the Finance
Committee will undertake a close review of the Audigraphics data provided recently to determine
what it is costing us per listener, per subscriber, per market, per hour of programming...in order
give the Executive Director and the General Managers benchmarks for improvement. Even with that
data my feeling is that a more beneficial disposition would be of the New York signal as there is
a smaller subscriber base without the long and emotional history as the Bay Area, far more
associated value, a similarly dysfunctional staff though far less effective and an overall better
opportunity to redefine Pacifica going forward. It is simply the more strategic asset.

With this in mind I would encourage frank description of the realities of the media enviornment we
operate in and of Pacifica’s available resources to participate and have impact in the evolving
media world. The Executive Committee, at a minimum, should have access to experts (whether from
Wall Street, NPR/CPB, Microsoft or otherwise) to get a strong reality check (me included) about
radio and Pacifica’s position in it so that informed decisions can be made. My feeling is that we
are experiencing a slow financial death which is having the normal emotional outbursts
commensurate with such a disease. We will continually experience similar events, in fact we have
been experiencing similar events over the past several years, primarily because we are not self
supporting through subscriber contributions and have a self imposed constraint on asset
redeployment that leaves us cash starved at a time when our industry is being propelled in new
directions, each requiring capital outlays of consequence. We’re boxed in at our own will. This
board needs to be educated, quickly, and to take action that will be far more controversial that
the KPFA situation. How can we get there?

So, now I’ve exhaled more than I should, but you know where I’m at. Let’s do something.

MDP

Pacifica has now been sued in California court, and is accused of constituting its board illegally
(insert link to lawsuit text) as well as fiscal irresponsibility.  THIS MAY WELL LEAD TO BOARD
MEMBERS BEING SUMMONED TO TESTIFY...AND TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR MOVING THE ORGANIZATION TOWAD
BANKRUPTCY.  Do board members understand their personal liability now?

A legislative hearing has been called for in Sacramento into the situation.  AGAIN, INDIVIDUAL
BOARD MEMBERS MAY BE CALLED TO TESTIFY, AND PROVIDE FINANCIAL RECORDS.  Are board members ready
for this?

Another lawsuit may be in the works concerning the lockout of workers.  DO BOARD MEMBERS
UNDERSTAND THEIR LIABILITY HERE?  Pacifica is spending tens of thousands of dollars on armed
security guards (at least six) 24 hours a day at the station and at the transmitter.  In addition,
Pacifica is spending huge amounts of money on legal fees, extra employees brought in especially
for this takeover, outside consultants and offices.  DO BOARD MEMBERS HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF
THESE EXPENDITURES? WHERE IS THE MONEY COMING FROM?  HOW CLOSE IS PACIFICA TO BANKRUPTCY?

Pacifica constantly says it wants arbitration.  The staff and community have stated REPEATEDLY for
three and a half months that we’re willing to arbitrate.  But then Pacifica casts the conflict as
a “labor management dispute.”  THIS IS NOT A LABOR MANAGEMENT DISPUTE!  IT’S A CRISIS INVOLVING
PAID AND UNPAID WORKERS, THE COMMUNITY, AND KPFA’S LOCAL MANAGEMENT AS WELL.  A steering committee
of 11 representatives from all these constituencies has been waiting for NEARLY THREE WEEKS TO
TALK TO PACIFICA.  No response.

Dr. Mary Frances Berry refused to meet with that steering committee when here for a few hours last
week.  She has refused to meet with other groups which have beseeched her for months (including
major donors and African-American programmers).  She has told board members she will not discuss
with them either the lockout or the infamous “sell the stations” memo from Michael Palmer.  HOW
LONG ARE BOARD MEMBERS GOING TO TOLERATE A BOARD CHAIR THAT IS LEADING THE ORGANIZATION TO INFAMY
AND RUIN?

2. Pacifica affiliate stations have communicated their outrage and solidarity with the KPFA staff
and community, including stations in Portland, Oregon, Bridgeport, Connecticut, Troy, N.Y.,Tampa,
Boulder, Madison, Garberville, California and Philo, California.  Many have broadcast live
interviews with KPFA representatives.  IF YOU LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE THERE IS A COMMUNITY
STATION... CALL THEM AND HAVE THEM WRITE TO US!

3. Day long rallies continue today (Sunday) in front of KPFA/Pacifica, with songs, speeches,
street theater and more!  A camp-out has grown to over sixty people, with tents stretching the
entire city block.  COME BY AND SAY HELLO if you’re in the region!

And don’t forget to spread the word about our BIG BENEFIT CONCERT MONDAY NIGHT 7/19 AT THE
BERKELEY COMMUNITY THEATER AT 7:30 featuring Joan Baez, Dar Williams, Utah Phillips, Dr. Loco and
others!  No advance tickets (no time!) just be there - ticket sales start at 4 p.m. ($20).  WE
DON’T HAVE KPFA (DUH) TO PUBLICIZE THIS CONCERT...WE NEED TO GET THE WORD OUT!!!!

________________________________________________

Various parties have decried the fact that those leading the actions against Pacifica are
“Ex-Hippie Berkeleyites, 50 years old +” . But as a 30 year old -, I think that the children
aren’t a part because they’re drugged & comfy, as are most Americans.

Corporate Media Sleeping with Corporate Pacifica Board?

To their credit, seems the corporate media is sleeping right along with the Pacifica Board of
Directors, or so it appeared at about 3:15am this early Monday morning, July the nineteenth. I
rode frantically back and forth and up and down University Avenue and MLK in Berkeley trying to
observe the police and the protesters in front of KPFA and using a phone about five times trying
to get the Bay City News Service to contact some body - anybody - just one media person to tell
them that about twenty five Berkeley police officers had arrived at the KPFA studios and were
strapping on their riot gear in preparation of clearing the street in front of the radio station
by arresting protesters. Of course it was futile as the individual at Bay City News Service kept
insisting that no one seemed to be available for a very crucial newsworthy event, not to mention
the need of media witness to possible police brutality - which fortunately did not materialize.

It was about five minutes to three am this Monday morning and I was walking with another protester
 in the streets in front of the Peoples KPFA building on MLK Way in Berkeley and we were chatting
about some strategy or policy regarding the present KPFA-Pacifica crisis.  All at once, I looked
up and down toward University Avenue. There, briskly cruising in without lights or sirens, were
about six Berkeley police cars followed by two large, black mariahs (paddy wagons). At that time,
there were about twenty or more dome and other style tents set up against the KPFA building on the
sidewalk and probably another twenty or so tents scattered in the street.  Most people were
sleeping. There were probably about a dozen protesters awake and casually walking around talking.
The area had been relativly quiet since I had arrived.  I got there about 1:30am.  There were
probably a total of maybe a hundred and twenty-five people at the KPFA protest at this time.
Anyway, so I have my bicycle and I move at a fast walk in a northerly direction toward the street
and duck around the corner, jump on my bike and I am out of there. Before I left the scene, the
people that were awake and acting as security began hollering to wake people up and to let them
know that the police were moving in possibly to arrest everyone. I rode my bike as fast I could -
and a few blocks away on University Avenue - I spotted a couple of pay phones.  I jumped off my
bike and called Bay City News about three times trying to get someone from any media on the scene
- not only to just get a story - but to act as witnesses to any arrests or police abuse - as I
mentioned earlier. Anyway, after about my fourth attempt at trying to get the Bay City News
Service and the San Francisco Chronicle to pay attention and have someone show up at the KPFA
station on MLK, I finally gave up and went back to cautiously approach the potential arrest site
at the KPFA building. The police had gotten most people to clear the street (one entire block had
been barricaded in by the police) within the barricaded area and about eleven people decided to be
arrested. The eleven people sat down right in the middle of the street and were arrested one by
one.  The protesters had two video cameras that filmed the entire police action that took place
including all of the arrests. The arrests began at about 3:15am and were completed by 3:45am.
While the arrests were going on, the hundred and twenty-five or so protesters stood on the
sidewalk directly in front of the KPFA studios and chanted support slogans for the arrestees and
anti-corporate - anti-Pacifica slogans at the Berkeley corporate police. By 3:50am, thepolice
ordered everyone to stay out of the street as a streetsweeper was going to “clean” the entire one
block area that the protesters had occupied.

_____________________________________________

As a closing piece of information: the tracings of KPFA associates show that intercessions by the
White House and Justice Dept have been made in Pacifica as early as 1991, and most fervently and
recently as 1999 by the latter, particularly in wake of Democracy Now’s programs on Chevron in
Nigeria and KPFA’s reporting on impeachment and investigative reporting on Maxxam and Henry Hyde,
most notably, last month, on The Ecologist v Monsanto, and on and on.

Nobody needs explaining how influential phone calls to influential politicians are quickly heeded.
(Chevron has been ongoingly outraged by Pacifica’s coverage, and went so far [on a local level] as
to physically remove KPFA news reporter Wendell Harper from the Chevron board meeting this year):

"So an 'It must be stopped' from Corporate America and conservative star chambers could easily
have engendered a move by liberal government and its intelligence battalions to engineer a
discreet way to erode, in short time, Pacifica’s (and the US’s, cf Gary Webb and the two CNN
reporters who were nearly permitted to air [before they were fired at the insistence of the DOD]
the story on Sarin gas and the US Military’s mass assass. of 'chicken soldiers' who’d escaped
Vietnam combat and were hiding in Laos) most left news reporters and reports. I think the
utilization of Mary Berry and 'race/lack of diversity at KPFA' front is clearly, for a politician
like Clinton, the craftiest first means."

WRITERS WRITING/WRITERS TALKING

        Suzanne Berne has won the Orange Prize for Fiction for her novel,
A
Crime in the Neighborhood (Viking/Workman). The 30,000 pounds annual prize

is given to the best novel written by a woman and published in the UK.
Also
shortlisted: Julia Blackburn's The Leper's Companion (Cape/Random House);
Marilyn Bowering's Visible Worlds (Flamington/ HarperCollins); Jane
Hamilton's The Short History of a Prince (Doubleday/Random House); and
Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible (Faber/HarperCollins).
        Italian writer Pia Pera's take on Lolita, a novel called Lo's
Diary,
will be published by Foxrock Press. Farrar, Straus, & Giroux dropped the
book, originally slated for a fall,'98 release, after Dimitri Nabakov, son

of, sued the publisher for copyright violation. Nabakov will receive 5% of

the royalties,and will write some introductory material to be included in
the edition.
        Poet Nikki Giovanni talks to Publishers Weekly, in a June 28th
interview, about teaching and writing, Tupac Shakur and Allan Iverson,
cancer recovery and nesting robins.


WDS JOINS ACLU IN MICHIGAN ANTI-CENSORSHIP SUIT; HOUSE VOTES WELL;
  SENATE COMMITTEE VOTES POORLY

        In response to Michigan's enactment of a law forbidding the
provision
of"sexually explicit" materials online to minors, WDS and the ACLU have
filed suit, and are seeking an injunction against the enforcement of the
law. Its vague language makes the law dangerous to publishers, even those
who live outside the state of Michigan, who could be held liable for any
sexually explicit material on their sites.  Other plaintiffs include
Litline and Alt-X.
        In related news, Arts Wire Current <http://www.artswire.org> notes
that the
House of Representatives defeated the "Children's Defense Act of 1999" by
a
vote of 282-146. Introduced by my personal demon, Representative Henry
Hyde,
the amendment would have crimimalized the sale to minors of "any picture,
photograph, drawing, sculpture,[etc., etc., etc.] containing explicit
sexual
or violent material." The ABA's Bookweb reports that on June 23rd, the
Senate Commerce Committee approved a bill mandating that any school or
library that uses federal funds for Internet connections must install
filters to block
access to "material deemed to be harmful to minors."


SMALLPRESS.NET BOASTS THE BEST OF INDEPENDENT PUBLISHERS

        SmallPress.Net <http://smallpress.net> has arrived to expedite the

purchasing of literary books online. Created and sponsored by the Literary

SmallPress.Net is fast, meticulously focused, and bereft of unwanted
distractions.Set for rapid expansion, SmallPress.Net will soon partner
with
other publishers to showcase the finest new literature. With such
luminaries
as Gray Wolf, Milkweed, and Copper Canyon aboard, this new storefront
promises to become a must-shop for lit. lovers online.


ON OFFER: NEW AT WDS'S LITERARY BUFFET

work by Robert Bly, Holly Iglesias, and Max Winters. In numbers 1 and 2,
Stuart Dybek, Rosemarie Waldrop, and Chilean great Gabriela Mistral all
appear.
         ZYZZYVA editor Howard Junker pithily and lovingly discusses
little
magazines, and Ford Madox Ford's stewardship of one in particular, on the
brand new--clear, clean--ZYZZYVA home page
<http://www.webdelsol.com/ZYZZYVA>.
        Proems? Posetry? In Posse
<http://www.webdelsol.com/InPosse>grapples with
questions of genre. Meanwhile, forms, forms, and more forms abound at La
Petite Zine <http://www.webdelsol.com/La_Petite_Zine>. LPZ's editors bring

you microfictions, short shorts, ghazals, and tanka, aiming to "build on
the
past" while barreling towards the future. Lagniappe features sweet little
freebies, odds and ends, and writerly tchotchkes.
        Work by Mackinnon, Darton, Baillargeon, and Maginnes appears in
the New
England Review <http://www.webdelsol.com/New_England_Review>; poetry by
Barbara Hamby and fiction by Reynolds Price distinguish the current web
issue of Five Points <http://www.webdelsol.com/Five_Points>, which will

<http://webdelsol.com/Perihelion> focuses on women poets
working in electronic and print media. Beautiful graphics started your
editor off on one those long questions about text and image, image and
text.


SMALL FISH LAUNCH NEW LINE, BIG FISH GET BIGGER

        Poets & Writers <http://www.pw.org.> notes the launch of a trade
paperback
imprint by the New York Review of Books. Twelve titles, among them Julio
Cortazar's The Winners, are to be released this fall by the venerable
journal's new  line. According to series editor Edwin Frank, the imprint
will focus on  reprints of challenging,
little- or lesser-known books.
        According to a June 18th article in the New York Times
<http://www.nytimes.com/library/books/>, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. has
announced its acquisition of Avon Books and William Morrow & Co. With the
close of this deal, News Corp.'s HarperCollins will greatly expand its
market share. Avon and Morrow together comprise twenty-two imprints that
publish 1,000  books every year. The Times also notes recent speculation
that Time Warner,which already owns Little, Brown and Warner Books, might
be
eyeing Simon and Schuster. (See Bookwire at <http://www.bookwire.com> for
the most recent Time Warner/S &S
developments. Apparently the acquisition is off, but a joint
venture-details
hazy--is probable.) And, adding fuel to the fire of my  despair, the Times

also also notes that distributors and bookstores are getting into the
consolidation game. Happily, in the wake of the Federal Trade Commission's

objection to the deal, Barnes and Noble announced on June 2 that it would
not buy Ingram Book Company, the distributor.



WDS TO TAKE HOLLYWOOD; TOM CRUISE CHANGES HIS MIND; SUN &
  MOON PRESS LOSES A BOOK

        WDS plans to host its first annual writer's workshop and film
festival in
Los Angeles, in summer, 2000. Hurdles remain, but the outlook is
favorable.
The workshop/festival will provide an opportunity for story (and perhaps
poetry) contest winners to not only meet and mingle with independent
filmmakers, but to have their works adapted into film. The films will then

be shown at the festival. The event will also feature a screenwriting
component run by Pulitzer-winner Robert Olen Butler. The workshop portion
of
the event will be trail-bossed by Meg Files, veteran of the well known
Pima
Writer's Workshop.
        Also on the film front, the imminent opening of Stanley Kubrick's
"Eyes Wide Shut" has provoked a flurry of tie-in and rights news. Warner
Books will publish the US and Penguin UK the British versions of the book
tie-in,which will feature both the screenplay and Arthur Schnitzler's
"Dream
Story,"on which the film is based. Co-star Cruise had objected to the
inclusion of photographs, since the August book releases predate the
movie's
international release in September. Now, apparently, he's relented.
According to Publishers Weekly <http://www.bookwire.com/PW/>, Kubrick's
acquisition  of the rights included
control of any new editions, in English, of "Dream Story." When Sun & Moon

Press's contract with S. Fischer, the book's German publisher, expired in
August of 1998, the latter chose to wait for the chance of film tie-ins
rather than renewing its contract with the very independent LA publisher.
        For news and views from a personal favorite, Women Make Movies'
executive director Debra Zimmerman, visit WDS's new film blurbs.


A MEGA-SPAMMING MOST SEVERE:IMMATURE PRANK OR NET TERRORISM?

        On May 31, 1999, the WDS mail server at Mindspring was repeatedly
bombed
over an indefinite period of time by well over 1200 spam mails, launched
for
the purpose of clogging up the server and preventing use.  Many hours and
headaches later, the mails were finally deleted. WDS firmly believes that
a
staff editor at the Cortland Review was responsible for the assault. WDS
and
Cortland Review had been at odds over the sharing of a mail list and
subsequent harassments leveled at WDS by the editors of Cortland Review.
An
hour following the last email exchange on the subject, the WDS mail server

was effectively crashed by the mega spamming. WDS believes this action was

taken to follow up on prior and specific server-attack threats issued by a

Cortland Review editor (who had also threatened WDS editors with physical
violence).
        The editors at WDS feel this incident to be very unfortunate and
stunning
considering the source. An AOL server in Virginia was used.  The incident
was reported to the Fairfax police authorities as a violation of the
Virginia Computer Crimes Act. The investigation is still ongoing.  AOL is
also looking into the matter. WDS is seeking further legal advice. WDS
feels
the matter must be aired, if for no other reason than to dissuade further
belligerance.

to for new contributing editors Richard Zenith and Tony Lombardo.


PI_R_ROUND: A LOCUS FOR HIGH SCHOOL CREATIVE WRITING PROGRAMS

        In keeping with its promise to include creative writing programs
from
around the country,WDS has created a new site called the Mercersburg
Review
which showcases new writing by high school students at Mercersburg Academy

in Pennsylvania. The Mercersburg site will be the first of several HS
programs to follow and be collected in a greater website called
Pi_R_Round,
http://webdelsol.com/Pi_R_Round. The Mercersburg students and their
teachers, Joel Chace and Aron Solomon, will facilitate the inclusion of
work
from other schools.
        Meanwhile, work continues on the Creative Writing Project begun by
WDS and
Ohio State University over a year ago.  Five universities are currently
part
of the project, with four more waiting in the wings and soon to be added.
Visit the CWP at <http://webdelsol.com/CWP>.


MACARTHUR FOUNDATION AWARDS CAMPBELL MCGRATH

    Poets & Writers reports that the foundation described the author as
"one of
the most creative poets of his generation." Director of the poetry program

at Florida International University, McGrath is the author of Spring Comes

to Chicago (Ecco Press, 1996), American Noise (Ecco Press,1993) and
Capitalism (Wesleyan University Press,1990). Road Atlas, his new book, is
scheduled for July publication.


SALINGER'S DAUGHTER TO PUBLISH MEMOIR

In the fall of 2000, Simon and Schuster will publish Margaret Salinger's
memoir. The author had originally planned to publish with Riverhead, an
imprint of Penguin Putnam; however, not satisfied with the deal, she has
now
signed with S & S's Pocket Books.

From:         david bromige <dcmb@METRO.NET>
Subject:      RADIO STATION KPFA, BERKELEY
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Listfellows : I am posting this message from the poet Trane DeVore because
I agree with him that the closure of KPFA radio would be the final nail in
our coffin. For decades now, increasingly, as corporations swallow up the
media, KPFA has been the only source I know of for information whose
dissemination is anywhere from distressing to deadly for corporate rule of
the world. Believe me, this radio station shows NPR up for the wishy-washy
liberals they unfortunately suppose they have to be. During the recent
illegal war NATO conducted upon "the former Yugoslavia," via KPFA one heard
every evening voices from Belgrade bearing witness to the reality of the
destruction wrought in our names and with our money. It was through KPFA I
first learned that the cluster-bombs our planes jettisoned over the
Adriatic, were killing Italian fishermen---and causing the ports there to
be shut down. First learned that, contrary to U.S. spokespersons, many U.S.
planes had been shot down---I recall the number, then, before the bombing
was stopped, as 37.

Clearly, such a station (which also opposed the illegal war on Iraq) is
uncomfortable to the Clinton regime; and Marion Berry, his appointee to the
body that oversees PBS, is now in charge of the Pacifica Foundation, the
non-profit corp that oversees KPFA and 4 (I think) sibling-=stations. The
current board of Pacifica illegally rewrote the mission statement, in
contempt for KPFA's constituency, to attempt to turn the station into a
middle-of-the-road (maindrain) outfit, unlikely under such a policy to
disturb any thing or one. They may have notions of going even further. A
sign held up at a recent rally here in my home town Sebastopol, claimed to
cite a secret memo from Michael Palmer, the new Treasurer-Elect, to Lynn
Chadwick, a Pacifica functionary, suggesting KPFA could be sold to
corporate buyers for $70 million.

Anyone old enough to remember KQED TV before it went to commercials, will
know the enormous destruction to its intelligence this commercialism
("Nature Is Brought to You By Exxon") has, with all deliberation, wrought.
My god, how many years of "Are You Being Served"? "Are you being screwed"
would be closer to the point.

Lynn Chadwick used to work for Voice of America, a propaganda station
serving corporate interests by presenting an unreal americanism to the
(un)suspecting 3rd world. I doubt she did a 180 on her way to Pacifica.
The infiltration of the Pacifica board couldnt have been smoother if it had
been cooked up in a rightwing thinktank. One notes the timing---Chadwick
fires the KPFA station manager the week before KPFA was to celebrate its
50th birthday; Chadwick locks out the employees of this admittedly leftwing
station and goes to canned music on July 13, as though to pre-empt any
storming of any Bastille. I hear Robert Duncan saying, as more than once he
did to me, "It doesn't have to be a plot, it works like one anyway," when I
discerned the workings of one in the coincidence of more than one rightwing
attack on democratic institutions. Dear gullible Robert.

Elan Fabbri, spokesperson for Pacifica, has declared that employees of KPFA
who discussed the takeover on the air are "mutinous." To all you
language-mechanics and discourse-analysts out there, this word-choice will
surely be revealing. It reveals to me the authoritarian nature of Pacifica
as currently constituted. Here in America we find mutiny very interesting.
This is a nation born of mutiny. We have made "Mutiny on the Bounty" and
"The Caine Mutiny" into perennial favorites. When power becomes aloof,
unsusceptible of appeal,  what recourse have we, but mutiny?

I apologize for the length of this introduction to Trane's letter. Please
read that, and, if you feel so moved, please spread the word. The more
people who know of this, the more difficult it will be for Pacifica to
continue its illegal rewriting of its historical mission, the more
difficult it will be to sell KPFA down the river. We need to get people all
over the world stirred up, we need the protest to reach proportions where
even the bought media can't ignore it. KPFA is a strong expression of the
conscience of America, and America with a silenced conscience will bring
ruin throughout the globe. Further ruin, I should have written.

>As many of you probably know by now, the Pacifica Foundation has

>fifty years, is under assault by a parent organization that is
>decidedly undemocratic and is seeking to change, against the wishes of
>a broad and diverse listenership, the shape of programming at the

>firing was that she was "not a good fit."  The paid and unpaid staff at
>KPFA began to voice thier dissent on air and were told that they could
>not.  The imposition of an internal gag rule, an crime against free
>speech at KPFA, led to the termination of two prominent
>broadcasters--Larry Bensky and Robbie Osman.  Pacifica tried to censor
>the KPFA evening news, claiming that the crisis at KPFA was "not
>news"--as Eileen Alfenderi (sp.?), co-host of the KPFA evening news,
>pointed out that the evening news had not been asked to hold back on a

>to this); these guards were obviously put in place to intimidate the
>staff.  On Tuesday, Dennis Bernstein broadcast a show about the crisis
>at KPFA and was forcibly removed from the station by the armed guards.
>The KPFA evening news tried to report on this, but was forced from the

>condemning the Pacifica Foundation's acts has been recorded and should
>be available over the web soon.  People protesting this action include
>Alice Walker, June Jordon, Jerry Brown, and Barbara Lee, just to name a
>few.  It is imperative that anyone who supports free speech and
>anti-corporate community run radio to do what they can to help out at
>this critical juncture.  KPFA was founded by pacifists and is one of
>the only radio stations that regularly produces shows on Latin America,
>corporate power, gay and lesbian issues, labor issues, issues that
>concern minorities and people of color, environmental issues, and the
>list goes on.  KPFA is also a vital source for alternative forms of
>music and a voice in the local music scene.  I urge you to contact your
>Representatives, your Congresspeople, and even your local politicians.
>We must not lose KPFA.  For more information, and to put your name on
>the list of contacts for protest actions, please contact

A Reading : Want to let Bay Area residents know of Ken Irby's reading this
coming Sunday, August 1, at the Dickerson home, 1605 Berkeley Way, in
Berkeley, at 3 p.m. Ken is out from Lawrence, Kansas for a couple weeks,
and is currently staying with Bob Grenier, and midweek and thenceforth,
will be at Duncan McNaughton's. If you need to contact Ken, backchannel and
I'll put you in touch.

A Redundancy : My post re KPFA may well have been that for you-all. If so,
=CE apologize. I unsubbed when I went to Vancouver, and it was while I was
there that I learned that the S (Pacifica) had hit the F (KPFA) for real.
In a recent conversation, I learned that sveral posts on this topic were
posted to the List during that week when I was unsubbed, posts by Pierre
Joris (merci pour =E7a, Pierre) and others, to whom, thanks.

A Resource : a listmember recently asked me where he might obtain a copy of
my 1980 book _My Poetry_ , long o.p. Yesterday I discovered it is available
thru Granary Books, at 212-226-5462, or e-mail at sclay@interport.net . I
make this a general post because their list includes many other o.p. books
by a variety of poets of possible interest to this List.

Strings is a playful series of Flash pieces about relationships. It also
raises questions about the presence/absence of the hand in  this medium.
Visual artists often criticise the lack of presence of the hand in
digital art. In Strings, the hand is and is not present, is transformed,
is transforming, is writing, is written, coded, morphed.

The guitar; then the electric guitar. The pen; then the electric pen.

I don't know about the best, but Donald Allen's reissued, "New American
Poetry ..." is welcome on my shelves.  Cole Swensen's "North" is one of my
favorites, but it doesn't qualify for 1999, so I'll choose her "Try," which
I believe did come out in 1999.

I have a feeling "Elegy for the Southern Drawl," by Rodney Jones will not be
a big favorite in these here parts, but I'll mention it anyway.  My tastes
are, I guess, sloppily eclectic, having come from no training and a lot of
reading.

Hope this helps,

David,

Thanks for passing this along to the list. Those in or around the Bay Area
should know that a large-scale rally is being planned for this Saturday,
7/31, assembling at 11am at UC Berkeley's Sproul Plaza and marching to
Martin Luther King Park. Also, lunch-hour leafletting continues outside the
downtown SF offices of the Fineman Group (?), an expensive PR firm hired
illegally hired to do spin control by the Pacifica Foundation (and paid with
the contributions of listeners who overwhelmingly oppose the board's recent
course of action).

News over the SavePacifica e-list this morning is that the Pacifica Board
might well be meeting today for the purposes of putting the Palmer "fire
sale" memo into action. Those concerned should check out the websites at the
end of Trane DeVore's message - each contains addresses, fax numbers, etc.,
for Pacifica board members, California state legislators, legal defense
funds, and other necessaries. It's especially urgent that Californians
convince the legislature to conduct its investigation into the possibility
of revoking Pacifica's nonprofit charter (something they were planning on
doing anyway) on an emergency basis, in order to respond to this immediate
threat. Listees in other states might want to check into actions in their
area: Is there a local radio station that carries Pacifica programming? Has
that station's board passed a resolution yet condemning the illegal power
grab by the Pacifica board of directors? Those with academic affiliations
might also want to write to the powers that be at U Penn, where board chair
(and Clinton shill) Mary Frances Berry is a faculty member, to express their
concern over her obvious failure to understand that university's free speech
policies.

More on this as things develop...

Best,
Taylor

To:     POETICS@LISTSERV.ACSU.BUFFALO.EDU
Subject:        RADIO STATION KPFA, BERKELEY

Listfellows : I am posting this message from the poet Trane DeVore because
I agree with him that the closure of KPFA radio would be the final nail in
our coffin. For decades now, increasingly, as corporations swallow up the
media, KPFA has been the only source I know of for information whose
dissemination is anywhere from distressing to deadly for corporate rule of
the world. Believe me, this radio station shows NPR up for the wishy-washy
liberals they unfortunately suppose they have to be. During the recent
illegal war NATO conducted upon "the former Yugoslavia," via KPFA one heard
every evening voices from Belgrade bearing witness to the reality of the
destruction wrought in our names and with our money. It was through KPFA I
first learned that the cluster-bombs our planes jettisoned over the
Adriatic, were killing Italian fishermen---and causing the ports there to
be shut down. First learned that, contrary to U.S. spokespersons, many U.S.
planes had been shot down---I recall the number, then, before the bombing
was stopped, as 37.

Clearly, such a station (which also opposed the illegal war on Iraq) is
uncomfortable to the Clinton regime; and Marion Berry, his appointee to the
body that oversees PBS, is now in charge of the Pacifica Foundation, the
non-profit corp that oversees KPFA and 4 (I think) sibling-=stations. The
current board of Pacifica illegally rewrote the mission statement, in
contempt for KPFA's constituency, to attempt to turn the station into a
middle-of-the-road (maindrain) outfit, unlikely under such a policy to
disturb any thing or one. They may have notions of going even further. A
sign held up at a recent rally here in my home town Sebastopol, claimed to
cite a secret memo from Michael Palmer, the new Treasurer-Elect, to Lynn
Chadwick, a Pacifica functionary, suggesting KPFA could be sold to
corporate buyers for $70 million.

Anyone old enough to remember KQED TV before it went to commercials, will
know the enormous destruction to its intelligence this commercialism
("Nature Is Brought to You By Exxon") has, with all deliberation, wrought.
My god, how many years of "Are You Being Served"? "Are you being screwed"
would be closer to the point.

Lynn Chadwick used to work for Voice of America, a propaganda station
serving corporate interests by presenting an unreal americanism to the
(un)suspecting 3rd world. I doubt she did a 180 on her way to Pacifica.
The infiltration of the Pacifica board couldnt have been smoother if it had
been cooked up in a rightwing thinktank. One notes the timing---Chadwick
fires the KPFA station manager the week before KPFA was to celebrate its
50th birthday; Chadwick locks out the employees of this admittedly leftwing
station and goes to canned music on July 13, as though to pre-empt any
storming of any Bastille. I hear Robert Duncan saying, as more than once he
did to me, "It doesn't have to be a plot, it works like one anyway," when I
discerned the workings of one in the coincidence of more than one rightwing
attack on democratic institutions. Dear gullible Robert.

Elan Fabbri, spokesperson for Pacifica, has declared that employees of KPFA
who discussed the takeover on the air are "mutinous." To all you
language-mechanics and discourse-analysts out there, this word-choice will
surely be revealing. It reveals to me the authoritarian nature of Pacifica
as currently constituted. Here in America we find mutiny very interesting.
This is a nation born of mutiny. We have made "Mutiny on the Bounty" and
"The Caine Mutiny" into perennial favorites. When power becomes aloof,
unsusceptible of appeal,  what recourse have we, but mutiny?

I apologize for the length of this introduction to Trane's letter. Please
read that, and, if you feel so moved, please spread the word. The more
people who know of this, the more difficult it will be for Pacifica to
continue its illegal rewriting of its historical mission, the more
difficult it will be to sell KPFA down the river. We need to get people all
over the world stirred up, we need the protest to reach proportions where
even the bought media can't ignore it. KPFA is a strong expression of the
conscience of America, and America with a silenced conscience will bring
ruin throughout the globe. Further ruin, I should have written.

Since there is some discussion about WCW's special feelings for
Black women, this comment of his might be considered in piecing
together the bigger picture:

 "Suppose all women were delightful, the ugly, the short, the fat,
the intellectual, the stupid, even the old-- and making a virtue of
their qualities, each for each, made themselves available to men,
some man, any man--without greed. What a world it could be-- for
women!... Take for instance the fat: If she were not too
self-conscious, did not regret that she were not lissome and quick
afoot but gave herself, full-belly to the sport! What a game it would
make! All would then be, in the best sense, beautiful--entertaining
to the mind as to the eye but especially to that part of a man which
we so mistakenly call the intellect... He would be free, freed to the
full completion of his desires."

Re: KPFA

In response to David Bromige's great note and other list members'
contributions, I have sent the following letter to Dr. Mary Frances Berry and
other members of the National Pacific Board. I urge others to write. I have
provided the Board member contact info as well as other important contacts
and events at the end of my letter:

>>Dear Dr. Mary Fances Berry: I am writing to protest what I understand is
your proposal to the National Pacific Board to sell member owned station KPFA.
As a listening member of the San Francisco Bay Area community, I am appalled
by this proposal, your support of the current station's repression, as well
as your continued false statements about the demographics and the leadership
of the station. That you have resorted to the old George Bush 'race card'
tactic (in this case using "white middle aged men") to attempt to undermine
racial and gender inclusive support for the station is more than appalling.
Instead of true, in fact, your actions can only be perceived as a cover for
the kind corporate carpet-bagging that has already compromised much of what
currently constitutes National Public Radio and Television.
The Northern California community raised the funds to build and support this
station. Part of the reason for our support is to protect the station from
deals with "sponsors." I ask that you and the national board respect the
integrity of its foundations and put your energies either into rebuilding our
confidence, or simply resigning from your positions.

Laura and Petrarch: An Intriguing Case of Cyclical Love Dynamics
by Sergio Rinaldi

http://epubs.siam.org/sam-bin/dbq/article/30592

I think this may be very interesting to some on this list (see abstract
below). First to note that it is from the SIAM (Science and Industry
Advance with Mathematics!) Journal on Applied Mathematics [the
exclamation is mine]. Maybe you've already seen it? Maybe it's an Alan
Sokial(?)-like hoax for all I know, I haven't read it yet, but am
curious. Maybe Sergio is on this list? Maybe he should be. Comes in
convenient PDF and many other options.

Abstract: Three ordinary differential equations are proposed to model
the dynamics of love between Petrarch, a celebrated Italian poet of the
14th century, and Laura, a beautiful but married lady. The equations are
nonlinear but can be studied through the singular perturbation approach
if the inspiration of the poet is assumed to have very slow dynamics. In
such a case, explicit conditions are found in the appeals of Laura and
Petrarch and in their behavioral parameters that guarantee the existence
of a globally stable slow-fast limit cycle. These conditions are
consistent with the relatively clear portrait of the two personalities
one gets while reading the poems addressed to Laura. On the basis of the
scarce and only qualitative information available, the calibration of
the parameters is also performed; the result is that the calibrated
model shows that the poet's emotions followed for about 20 years a quite
regular cyclical pattern ranging from the extremes of ecstasy to
despair. All these findings agree with the recent results of Frederic
Jones, who, through a detailed stylistic and linguistic analysis of the
poems inspired by Laura, has discovered Petrarch's emotional cycle in a
fully independent way.

Dear Listmates:

For a study of the reception of the US poet William Carlos Williams in Australia and New
Zealand, I would appreciate references, evidence, impressions, especially from those on the scene.

How has Williams's work come to be known?  Has it been particularly noticeable at certain dates?
In what ways has its reception been part of larger developments, e.g, a turning away from British
models, an opening to modernist or post-modernist aesthetics?  Has the presence of Williams been
felt in other arts besides literature?  In addition to such general issues,  cases of local
transformations of Williams's much quoted poem "The Red Wheelbarrow" are of particular
interest.

To prime the pump, here are some sources I am already familiar with (as it happens, they
represent New Zealand more than Australia):

1) Williams's 1947 "Letter to an Australian Editor," written for Flexmore Hudson at POETRY:
THE AUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL QUARTERLY OF VERSE.  (Background on this
editor or journal would be welcome.)

2) Elizabeth Smither's YOU'RE VERY SEDUCTIVE, WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS
(1978).  (I know of this as a title but have not seen the text itself),

3) C. K. Stead's 1979 essay "From Wystan to Carlos  Modern and Modernism in Recent New
Zealand Poetry"

4) Allen Curnow's 1982 essay "Olson as Oracle: 'Projective Verse' Thirty Years On"

5) the 1984 short experimental film THE RED WHEELBARROW by NZ artist Bridget
Sutherland

6) an article by Harriet Margolis on the Sutherland film, published in a 1996 issue of NEW
ZEALAND STUDIES

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!  Apologies for cross-posting.  Please backchannel response
to tdiggory@skidmore.edu or post to list, as seems appropriate.

SOMARTS gallery  -  934 brannan & 9th
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        san francisco is a lot like the zurich of 1916 that produced the
original DADA movement: fiercely cosmopolitan, artistically charged, and
vibrating with absurd energy. the DADA movement started in zurich with a
series of amazing cabarets, too, full of weird performances strange
music odd little films and grotesque happenings. we're hoping to tap and
generate some of that anarchistic, iconoclastic spirit in our two-night
homage to DADA at SOMARTs gallery. we have san francisco's own amazing
dancing Devil-ettes designing something special for the show. plus:
Naked DADAheads, that yuppie-eradifier Kevin Keating (the artist
formerly known as "nestor makhno"), the amazing Frank Moore, the
venerable Bay Area
Dadaists (with erstwhile mailart maestro Bill Gaglione) with a tribute
to the FLUXUS movement of the '60s, Hank Hyena with a strange slide
show, a weird group called "vainglorious" doing their impression of
Franz Kafka, Mikl-em, King Ham and a host of others...as well as
nudists, oreo cookies, a Velcro symphony, seeing eye dogs, mud people, a
full-on DADA invocation and a Hugo Ball Memorial Photo booth.
        Friday and Saturday nights, July 30th and 31st, at 730pm:
SOMARTS gallery is going to be jumping. tickets are $7-10 donation (no
one turned away for lack of funds).

WRITER'S CRAFT
NCCA 250e - 3 credits - Bill Scheffel

Course Description
"Poetry is not an expression of the party line. It's that time of night,
lying in bed, thinking what you really think, making the private world
public; that's what the poet does". Allen Ginsberg

Although this is a writing workshop in creative non-fiction, Allen
Ginsberg's
statement expresses the heart of the class. Our goal is polished and
exciting
prose that also reveals the gifts, nuances and idiosyncrasies  of each
participant's life. Student will develop the craft of writing and the
courage
to tell their own stories. We will offer feedback to each other in a
community spirit of trust and encouragement. Many ideas and methods will =
be
given to spark the creative process. Reading from a sourcebook of essays =
and

stories (and even some poetry) by writers such as Annie Dillard, Edward
Abbey, James Baldwin, Margueritte Duras and many others will be an =
integral
part of class. Natalie Goldberg's Writing Down the Bones will be a =
required
text. Open to writers of any level of experience.


About the Instructor
 Bill Scheffel has an MFA in Writing and Poetics from the Naropa Institute =

THE EXPOSITORY ESSAY
WRI 534e- 3 credits - Lee Christopher
Course Description
In French essay means an attempt, a test, or a trial. In this course,
students will experiment with their own thoughts within the structure of =
the

essay's various forms. They will explore many of the possibilities =
creative
nonfiction affords them.  For models, students will read essays by
Montaigne,
Virginia Woolf, Lu Hsun, Carlos Fuentes, Jorge Luis Borges, Ezra Pound,
Henry
Thoreau, James Baldwin, Andrienne Rich, Annie Dillard, Alice Walker, =
George
Orwell, William Carlos Williams, E.B. White, Andrei Codrescu, and Ralph
Waldo
Emerson. To further broaden their perspective, students will use as model
essayists the "Beats" such as Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William
Burroughs. The most common grammar and punctuation problems will be
addressed. In addition, each student will learn to recognize and correct =
his

or her own error patterns. As part of the writing process, time will be
spent
in reflection upon the ways in which problems were addressed and solved in =

our essays.

LITERATURE SEMINAR: THE FEELING TONE
WRI 530e- 3 credits - Bobbie Louise Hawkins

Course Description
In this Reading and Writing seminar we will address the work of four =
writers

as writers: namely, how do they achieve their unique tone and diction; and =

what can we use of their mode in our own work. This is not primarily a
writing class, it is a Literature class, but I teach writing to beginning
writers and I have found this approach to be useful for non-writers as =
well.

The writers and books will be (in this order):Evan Connell (Mrs. Bridge),
Fay
Weldon (Life and Loves of a She-Devil) Michael Ondaatje (Coming Through
Slaughter) Colette (Earthly Paradise).

nugget of actuality". The New York Times wrote: "A superb impressionist, =
as
well as a salty prose writer." She has performed her work at the Joseph =
Papp

Public Theater, Bottom Line, and Folk City in NYC, at The Great American

Society in England where she worked with Apples and Snakes.  In 1988 she =
was

invited by Anne Waldman to oversee the Prose Track in the MFA Writing
Program.

WRI 541e - 3 credits - T. Burke, Jr.

Course Description
For prose writers who want to achieve familiarity with dramatic structure. =

For dramatists looking to infuse more lyricism into their work. The course =

will explore the singular demands of narrative and dramatic
writing.... Determining the form in which a story can be most effectively
presented. Revealing character through action and the dynamics of =
dialogue.
Adapting classic and original prose into dramatic action. Plus, what
constitutes a scene. How classic dramatic structure can be applied to a
narrative. Self-editing as a creative skill.... At the end of the course,
each writer will have a vivid picture of what form best suits his/her =
style,

approach and sensibility and will possess a much stronger command of their =

craft.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I tend to think we're revolving around the old issue of the "Politics of
Poetic Form" here since, in someone like Bernstein's reading of the Pisan
Cantos, the form of the poem actually undermines what would be the non- or
supra-poetical work of the "man."  That is, it seems the essays by the man,
which we take to be a literary product of Pound as the "man of action"
don't find their fulfillment or their natural corollary in his poems, which
one would consider the works of the "man of thinking."  So talk of the
"man" is split here since we know this person two ways, via an activity
which we normally associate with biography -- what the guy did when he
wasn't writing poetry -- and the activity we normally associate with the
"work," that seemingly isolated ("art-for-art's sake"), timeless artifact.
If we are to take Bernstein's reading of Pound in "Pounding Fascism"
seriously, we wouldn't have any "man" left over to hold against the prize
or the literature -- the split would be too profound.

If you want to imagine a gross exaggeration of what this paradigm suggests
(though who's more exaggerated than Pound), imagine Robert Mapplethorpe
leading a double life as a Washington lobbyist, or some Xtian rightist,
pushing for something like strict policing of the internet, mandatory short
haircuts for men under the age of twenty, prayer before every meal, or well
just imagine him being some sort of obsessed (sexually repressed) outsider
politico pushing for centralized, conservative values (and symbols) that
run up against his art work.  Then, when it is time to offer him a prize,
you would be in the position of asking whether the "work" is the same thing
as the "man".  It's not unimaginable that even a Mapplethorpe could be
split this way, since there are all sorts of breaks like this in twentieth
century art, it seems, such as:

Why wasn't Robert Smithson an environmentalist?  (I know because I read his
writings, but it's surprising.)

Why does Clarence Major prefer the poetry of John Berryman over the "New
American" poets? (cf. Mackey on Major in Discrepant Engagement).

What are Ian Hamilton Finlay's political views?  (I.e. why is he, who in
many ways seems so much milder in temperament than a Bruce Andrews, more
clearly agrarian-rightist-revolutionary and someone like BA a leftist?)
Who, then, becomes the more "elitist" artist, the rural aristocratic Finlay
or the urban cosmopolitan Andrews?  And why do the poetics of a Marxist
like Hugh MacDiarmid seem invariably more conservative than Finlay's?

A recent one I came across: apparently the German painter Gerhardt Richter
was the prophet of pop art back in the day, introducing or at least
championing Warhol and those folk, but now he seems to clearly on the
monumental side -- large-scale abstract paintings, with a near classical
sense of balance, or perhaps romantic sense of sturm and drang -- with
someone like Kiefer in opposition to the "democratic" vision of someone
like Polke.  How does that happen?

Why are poets like Drew Milne and Jeremy Prynne, the former of whom is a
recognized Marxist scholar, more or less perceived, by the Americans aware
of their work, as somewhat reclusive, decidedly "highbrow" poets (I think
in the tradition of Thomas Gray)?  (My question is also whether Milne
recognizes any sort of camaraderie among the American language poets since
his introduction to the anthology of Marxist literary criticism he edited
with Terry Eagleton seemed to suggest a parallel series of ideas, despite
the very different temperament.)

(Sorry to present an exclusively male list here, but nobody comes to mind
right now as presenting this sort of dilemma, though I guess Moriko Mori,
who's a bit young to be well known, walks a pretty interesting line between
conservative "Buddhism" and her techno-narcissistic-adoration.)

Actually, more women do come to mind: why is Barbara Kruger using
techniques explored by proto-fascist artists, including some of their color
schemes, to present purportedly progressive feminist progaganda?  Is this
art or social work?

Well, not exactly. I agree that:

The work is not the man.
The prize is not the man.
Therefore, the man is neither the prize nor the work.

However:
The prize is the both work and the man.
There has to be work to be a prize; and, by implication, there has to be a
man (or woman) to be work. The ratio of man to prize increases in relation
to how "political" the selection criteria are.

In general, I feel that ethical considerations of the writer's life should
be entirely separate from considerations of the work--not that ethical
concerns shouldn't be considered, discussed, dissected, etc., just that
they
shouldn't be seen as germane to the work. At all. A close-up of anyone's
life reveals multiple layers, "selves" and contradictions--the study of
personality is an interesting one. However, in the case of a writer, their
biography is merely another footnote, and maybe a totally misleading
footnote at that. A critique of the work, on the other hand, is much closer
to the writer's "self."

That quote from Williams is new to me, and certainly
disturbing.  And I agree that it's the sort of statment we don't want to
forget about, but need to try to understand.  For me, though, that
understanding involves asking how someone with a view of culture as
interesting, complex and "open" as Williams's lapses into this sort of
thing.   It *still* seems to me ridiculous to put him in the same category
as Pound as an anti-Semite, unless you want to make the category
meaningless.  Pound's race-hatred is rabid, and his calls for fascist
"antisepsis," i.e. genocide, are clear.  I can't imagine Williams making
those Italian radio broadcasts any more than I can imagine Pound writing
"At the Ballgame."   Another pretty instructive exercise is to compare,
say,  *Jefferson and/or Mussolini* with *In the American*.

My point, again, is not to heroize Williams, but to look at what he
actually said
(yes, *including* comments like the one we're talking about here) and did,
and then to weigh the whole record.   We might even find, as I tried to
show in the piece I posted earlier, that there's some interesting (social)
thinking going on...stuff we might miss if we aren't careful.

Alright, that's probably enough from me on this subject, and I have to go
back to packing boxes for a move in the 96 degree swelter...  Steve

Hi Dodie,

You're probably right about this, I was just being picky with words in a
way.  There are many levels of impersonation that you can point to, a
virtual rainbow coalition.  For instance glammy-camp personas are hardly
personae on the level of, say, Al Gore being coached into the presidential
persona.  The persona you write about, the cocktail party one, reminds me
of the movie "Safe."  There are varieties of transvetitism which I think
would be interesting terms of poetry; my own explorations into this involve
a brief stint as Arthur Rimbaud in a "love" poem called "Verl" (a prose
piece inspired by the letters, which I guess kind of ties into Acker's
personas), poems as a fake English poet (partly inspired by a certain fake
Japanese poet), and the various times I've done my own pip-squeaky
imitations of Pound, etc.  I'd like it if more poets were transvestites;
most of us are rather boring in normal life so why not, and if fiction's
becoming so passe next to film and "new sentence" poetry then there aren't
many venues for identity performance left for a writer.  And since personae
become, in their ways, symbols, they surface above the semiotic as social
constructs that people can understand without having to become subject to
them, since the falseness is so foregrounded; i.e. there would be more meat
on the bones of a deconstructive poetics than say language-style all-over
razzling and hyper-collage aesthetics would seem to permit.  Entire senates
of puppet plastic personalities, but always tinged with the "pathos" of
discipline and responsibility, of a sort that poetry only seems capable of.

But what about when writers adopt certain tones and methods in their
writing -- I think of Jennifer Moxley here, she's probably the only one
right now -- which, in their stateliness of pace and foregrounded
anachronism (i.e writing as if certain 18th century value systems, such as
the emphasis on "sensibility", were still the ascendant, and countering
other values such as those centered around the "cult of speed" and
information, from Marinetti to O'Hara, for one), go up against any easy
romantic notion of "sincerity" and yet are actually using these styles as a
way to break back into the "lyric," i.e. the pure soul as speaking,
"suffering" thing.  Is this a sort of transvetitism (without the overtones
of freakishness, but with the cross-gendered aspect)?

Brian,

I'm intrigued by this idea of feigning a persona as opposed to
adopting one.  Adopting one sounds like putting it on proudly, even
buying into it.  Feigning one reminds me of those endless social
occasions when I've known what kind of persona was required but I
couldn't buy into it, didn't have the heart to fully embrace it, or
was lacking in the social skills to pull it off.  In those instances,
I'd say that feigning a persona would be much more appropriate a
category.  An awkward ineffectiveness.  Cocktail parties come to mind
as a dangerous site.  Also much of the humor on TV sitcoms, not that
I watch them enough to be an authority.

In writing, too, I think this comes up.  Kathy Acker's personas, for
instance, their delightfulness is in the sense of feigning rather
than adopting.  Pathos unbalancing power.

When I hit reply to all in Eudora, the speech function kicked in for
some reason and my computer started reading your message outloud to
me in this mechanical reverb voice.  Creepy, but appropriate somehow.

Pacifica Foundation's executive committee is to vote on sale
of KPFA this evening or tomorrow a.m.

If you haven't already, please consider contacting the names
below with statements of protest.

Poet Jack Folie has (had) a poetry show on KPFA Wednesdays.
Can his silence and invisibility during the struggle be taken
as pro-Pacifica? Or he may know much more about the dispute
and recent history of disputes than the average listener and so
have opinions or insights that preclude membership in the
movement; if anyone is familiar with him, please beseach him
to elucidate publicly.



______________________________________

Despite weeks of denial from Mary Frances Berry, Lynn Chadwick,
and their various public relations spokespeople, PACIFICA RADIO
IS PREPARING TO AUTHORIZE THE SALE OF THE NATION'S FIRST
FREE SPEECH, COMMUNITY CONTROLLED RADIO STATION.

The vote could come as early as today (Wednesday 7/28) in a
telephone meeting of the Pacifica executive committee.

Pacifica national board sources say a telephone discussion
yesterday about the Pacifica crisis was dominated, as usual,
by Dr. Berry, who insisted that KPFA be sold.  She said it had
become "unmanageable." (KPFA WAS, OF COURSE, "MANAGEABLE"
FOR FIFTY YEARS BEFORE BERRY INSTALLED CHADWICK AND HER
WRECKING CREW OF ARMED GUARDS, LAWYERS, PERSONNEL
TERMINATION SPECIALISTS  AND PUBLIC RELATIONS FLACKS.)

KPFA, located on the commercial FM band, may be worth as much as
$75 million to Pacifica.

There were also indications in yesterday's board meeting that
Berry and Chadwick's actions may be bankrupting Pacifica, and that the
executive committee may seek a large (perhaps as much as $5 million)
loan to pay for their enormous "security," legal, personnel, and
public relations expenses.  THIS LOAN WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY
DEFAULT, GIVING PACIFICA ONE MORE EXCUSE TO SELL KPFA.

From the introduction:
     "This issue of _Open Letter_ calls attention to the sometimes
graceless aspects of theory in an attempt to shatter its image as urbane
discourse. Theory is indeed a pulp genre, and a well-known emblem of
intellectual thuggery in universities. Its sensational and often poor
quality writing, full of arch gestures and bungled paybacks, offers all
who seek solace in it a measure of joyful tedium. And yet, outside the
academy, theory becomes something entirely different. It's picked up by
artists who literalize and actualize its precepts, wiping out the
distinction between theory and practice...."
     "We asked a number of contributors--some of whom have been publishing
since the 1970s--to write about the importance of theory to their work.
Unlike the academic industrialization of theory, in which researchers use
a canonical series of texts as tools to read other texts, we wanted to
question theory's importance to formally innovative writing. While some of
the writers in this issue now work in the university context, we offered
them and others a site for a return to the socially critical role occupied
by theory prior to its current accomodation by the university. So a
possible title for this untitled issue could have been _The Dis-
Accomodation of Theory_ because it shows a discomfort with the present
moment...."

(my $0.02: readers of recent _Philly Talks_ and of Jeff Derksen's _Disgust
and Overdetermination_ issue of _Open Letter_ will find a lot of cross-
dialogue contained herein.)

Hello,

I will be subletting my Brooklyn apartment for the last two weeks of August.  I live on a beautiful
street in the great neighborhood of Greenpoint, home to many poets.  Manhattan is easily accessible
by G or L train, and Williamsburg is a quick walk away.  My one speed bike is included and I'll even
fix the brakes.  My apartment is well lit, quiet, clean and overlooks my neighbors well tended
gardens (you can look out the window and watch them tending it).  There's a computer, plants, and
lots of books.  Cost is $350 + telephone calls and deposit.

If you  are interested, please email me at nonoam@mindspring.com.

Best,

Noam Scheindlin

I just recently read the anthology Fascism, edited by Roger Griffin for
Oxford Univerisity Press, and then went back to looking at Pound's writing
from Selected Essays and was struck by how the tone of EP's writings there,
not to mention the content, is not so far off from the Italian section of
this anthology, which isn't surprising but might be to those who abide by
the "Pound wasn't a fascist, he was a clown" mentality which is
occasionally put forth.  EP was in fact much more anti-Semitic than the
Italian fascists were at that time (at least officially), it seems to me at
least.

If I may, a brief plug for PATZCUARO, a new, elegantly produced chapbook by
Joanne Kyger. 30 pages. I don't have the price. Published by Blue Millennium
Press, Box 958, Bolinas, CA 94924. A spacious, incredibly attentive, elegant
eye; not afraid of the smart turn, situated within a baroque tension of
ancient and contemporary, the poems provide a focused mix of pleasure and
terror. I won't say ignore Joanne at peril. But "The Beautiful Adjectives and
Magnificent Metaphors of Pablo Neruda," achieved thru appropriation of quotes
of ten of his contemporaries, is well worth the price of admission. (Price &
book can probably be gotten thru SPD?). End dee plug.

Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

Brian,

I'm not familiar with all of your references, but you raise some interesting
points.

--"work" as I've used it, IS the "seemingly isolated ("art-for-art's sake"),
timeless artifact" as you put it. But you are positing another idea of work;
i.e., that of an activity connected to the historical and individual context
of the writer, and therefore an expression of the "man." That would be
non-fiction (in your example, the essays of Pound as opposed to the poetry).
Without getting into the distinctions between these two forms--fiction
(including poetry) and non-fiction (another interesting topic--e.g. memoir,
or new journalism, or "confessional" poetry), I'll just say that my
definiton of "work" is concerned only with the work of the imagination; or
fiction/poetry.

--Re: "imagine Robert Mapplethorpe leading a double life as a Washington
lobbyist, or some Xtian rightist, pushing for something like strict policing
of the internet, mandatory short haircuts for men under the age of twenty,
prayer before every meal, or well
just imagine him being some sort of obsessed (sexually repressed) outsider
politico pushing for centralized, conservative values (and symbols) that run
up against his art work."

I'd have no problem imagining this--if Mapplethorpe was never able to live
as an artist all of that would be entirely possible. In many ways, this is a
standard model of the conflict between the creative, usually
hidden-from-society, self and the public personna. It's a "double life" only
in the sense that the inner self is never reconciled/expressed as the outer
self. Instead, the outer self lays claim to the territory necessary for its
survival as a social being, develops the necessary masks and "personas" and
keeps the imagination hidden--unless it finds expression in art, writing,
etc. The more creative "exposure," the more chance to match up the inner and
outer selves. Mapplethorpe's artistic life was also his lived life, so it's
hard to see him violating that artisitc life, but don't MOST people lead a
so-called double life? How do you not do this? Attempting to live a life
focused entirely on truth of expression for example, or totally honest
interactions--is a pretty radical--and psychologically dangerous--way to
live. Without getting into all the psychological implications (and
biological and genetic), you could look at Sylvia Plath as an example of
someone striving to live "honestly." Her work was a nearly seamless
outgrowth of her emotional life. But this is generally not a survivable
condition in the "real world." Maybe in the world of saints and such.

Then, when it is time to offer him a prize, you would be in the position of
asking whether the "work" is the same thing
>as the "man".

See above. I don't agree that one would be in that postion, unless we're
discussing non-fiction.

Best,
Joan

What's the mystery? The essence of creativity is change.

Perception of the art is a decidedly distinct topic from expression of it.
This introduces an entirely new train of thought, not germane to the topic
of "work" vs. "man" I don't think, but more of an offshoot.

I don't know her work but it sounds like a great and lively
concept--re-using the techniques of the "enemy" in the service of one's own
propaganda. I don't know how such a thing would be classified--some
propaganda is indeed art ("Triumph of the Will"), some is merely banal
commentary. But "social work"? If this isn't tongue-in-cheek, then I don't
know what you mean here.

I can't reallly speak for Jack, but:

Jack Foley is not invisible! I live at Telegraph and Dwight in
Berkeley. A couple of days ago I looked out my window to see Jack and
another poet, Ivan Arguelles, taking part in an inpromptu KPFA rally.
Yes, I did go downstairs and join the rally, but I missed Jack, who
was playing pied -piper at the front of the march.

"close listening" edited by charles bernstein would have to be the best
collection of essays on performance poetry i have ever read.
i have been a professional performance poet since 1985 and i've always been
made to feel inferior to the print poets of australia - because people who
prefer print poetry were critiquing my work and the work of performance poets.
we are not included in the anthologies, the canons, we are not winning any
literary prizes, and our self publications are not even being archived in
libraries.
we will go unnoticed in the documentation of literary history.
yet we perform our writings to school students,  people in pubs, coffee
lounges, the streets and generally to a very good response from our often
unsuspecting audiences.
i have never had anyone come up to me at a poetry reading and say that they
would have prefered to have read these poems from a book.
whilst some may say that performance poetry by the poet ties down a poem to
one meaning, one interpretation of the poem, let me say that each time i
read a poem to a new audience the poem becomes new, the audience and the
ambiance of that particular reading rewites the poem.
"close listening" has changed the way i see my artform, one which i had
confidence and faith in, but one that was being continually put down by a
language that was designed to comment on print poetry and print publication.
bernstein's book has made me realize that, in fact, the audience for print
poetry has been steadily decreasing since WW2, in australia last year
oxford university press, penguin and university of queensland press dropped
their australian poetry lists, and even when they were publishing
australian poets, the print runs were 500-750 books, an incredibly small
number even by australian standards.
on the other hand, since WW2 we have seen a considerable increase in
interest for performance poetry and the development of career performance
poets like myself who actually make a living from performing their work
around the country.
black mountain and the beats, yefteshenko, dylan thomas, and the mersey
beat poets from the uk had their affect in australia as well.
at the moment we have about 15 performance poets, maybe more,  who earn
their living by speaking their poetry and another hundred or so who are
semi-professional.
in each capital city there is an active performance poetry scene.
if anything, the print poets, like  john tranter, les murray, bruce dawes,
who have been popular in this country, have adopted some of the techniques
of the performance poets, and more readily express their poetry in public.

"close listening" does not make an argument for performance poetry over
published poetry but rather recognizes that both are different artforms,
each with its own audience, each with its own critical language.

I came back from Berkeley where I had just finished hosting a two hour show
OUTSIDE the KPFA studios (at "Camp KPFA") to find this:

"Poet Jack Folie has (had) a poetry show on KPFA Wednesdays.
Can his silence and invisibility during the struggle be taken
as pro-Pacifica? Or he may know much more about the dispute
and recent history of disputes than the average listener and so
have opinions or insights that preclude membership in the
movement; if anyone is familiar with him, please beseach him
to elucidate publicly."

Where is this person getting his information?--not to mention the spelling of
my name. I have hardly been "silent and invisible." I have consistently
supported the protests at KPFA on the air, at rallies (where I have
occasionally spoken), and in many conversations. Like everyone else on the
staff, I am currently locked out of the station. I will participate in the
mass rally and march on Saturday and do whatever I can to think about and
resolve the crisis. I am featuring Nicole Sawaya (the ousted General Manager)
at a PEN Oakland event. I do not support Pacifica.

Sincerely,

Jack Foley

Below is the current subscribership of the Poetics List, arranged by
country.
Apologies for omissions due to the U.S.-imperialist bias secreted in the
Listserv
program, which in generating this data quietly assumes that addresses
without
a country code [such as .au for Australia] are U.S. addresses. Ach, hardly
any surprise in this you may be saying.

I'm trying to find a poem or some verse on the good things about turning 80,
or old age, ...

Any suggestions about where best to look, or some verse itself would be much
appreciated.

Heather, there's a famous poem by Sophocles about being very happy he had
turned 90, because he didn't have to worry about sex anymore -- "and all its
entangling confusions" if I remember correctly . . .

I'm not sure if Ezra Pound had it in mind when he wrote that hilarious
letter to WCW that Kent quoted yesterday, but maybe he should have!
