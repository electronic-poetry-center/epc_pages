DISCLOSURE:

First things first, the poem in question was lame and
certainly intended to be provocative. And being
provocative on this list is like being provocative in
a church basement. Nonetheless, I don’t merely seek
attention. There are some very interesting and
creative minds on this list and I benefit from
witnessing and participating in discussion. Long and
short of it is, I like this forum and think it could
be used more searchingly. I end up just pushing
buttons some of the time. I like to tussle, I used to
love getting thrown around and bloodied amongst peers
at punkrock shows. That’s kind of macho, I know. I
don’t deny it and I often make an ass of myself. But I
don’t trust people or communities that aren’t willing
to criticize themselves. I knew from an early age that
my relationship with my parents’ church would not be a
very intimate one the moment I realized there were
some questions you couldn’t ask.

That’s the impertinent little kid in me, yes, and I am
learning that like many people who are susceptible to
mental and emotional instability, part of me takes
positions of perceived invulnerability and stability
(aka authority) as a personal affront (*note to future
employers and academic institutions: the medication
works wonders. I’m a real team player!). That’s why I
love(d) the raging, damaged adolescent swagger of
Kathy Acker. Of course, I’m not immune to constructing
castles out of wet sand.

So with that disclaimer I’m going to try and do
something other than kick the crap out of a long dead
horse. Because sometimes you have to keep beating a
dead thing in order to understand it will not die,
there is always a remainder. Adorno: In the end
glorification of splendid underdogs is only
glorification of the splendid system that made them
so. I like to apply this insight to systems of thought
too. We are forever in need of new vigilances.


PART ONE

Situation 1.

I encounter ‘X.’  I think I know, more or less, where
‘X’ comes from. Where ‘X’ is coming from, if you will
(what ‘X’ means). ‘X’ appears to go against some
things I hold dear – that I believe everyone should
hold dear. ‘X’ doesn’t seem to respect where I or most
people like me are coming from.


I have had some very limited experience with ‘X’ in
the past and it was largely unpleasant. Thus, when ‘X’
rubs me the wrong way, I don’t feel a need to make
inquiries. I’m confident I now enough about ‘X;’ ‘X’
is repugnant, I am not. I understand, so there’s no
need for a conversation. I come out swinging,
rhetorically.


Situation 2.

I encounter ‘Y.’  I think I know, more or less, where
‘Y’ comes from. Where ‘Y’ is coming from, if you will
(what ‘Y’ means). ‘Y’ appears to go against some
things I hold dear – that I believe everyone should
hold dear. ‘Y’ doesn’t seem to respect where I or most
people like me are coming from.

I have had some very limited experience with ‘Y’ in
the past and it was largely unpleasant. Thus, when ‘Y’
rubs me the wrong way, I don’t feel a need to make
inquiries. I’m confident I now enough about ‘Y;’ ‘Y’
is repugnant, I am not. I understand, so there’s no
need for a conversation. I come out swinging,
rhetorically.


OK, so X = a poem. Or more accurately X = a register
(or type) of language.

Y = an individual, a person. Or more accurately Y =
someone of different ethnicity.



In Situation 1 (S1) the “I” is encountering a poem
that speaks unfavorably, using harsh language, about a
vast cross-section of the world’s population. The “I”
appeals to what it knows and the conclusions it has
drawn from available experience (lived, felt, thought,
etc) and data (books, media, etc). The “I’ cannot find
a point of access or entry into the poem, or the
language and opinions which seem to be expressed. The
poem and language are very much ‘the other.’

In Situation 2 (S2) the racist “I” is encountering an
individual who appears to do things, behave, and, from
the little “I” understands, conduct his/her life in a
manner that is unappealing. The racist “I” appeals to
what it knows and the conclusions it has drawn from
available experience (lived, felt, thought) and data
(books, media, etc). The “I” cannot find communion
with this culturally recalcitrant individual. The
individual is very much ‘the other.’


 * * *

The story, the logic, the form (indeed, the grammar)
of S1 and S2 are very similar, with significant
substitutions for the variables X, Y.

Now, an open-minded person or perhaps just an naïve
idiot might ask of X or Y “What do you mean?” or “I
don’t understand, can you give me some more
information or tell me more of your story?”

A condescending, complacent person or perhaps just a
brilliant academic might ask everyone standing around
X or Y “what conspiracy of forces has created such an
unpleasant creature as this poem, this person?”


PART TWO

As I write, I’ve received three reactions to the poem
“WHY DO THE TIAWANESE”. Two in public, one backchannel
(all by men).  No one liked the poem or thought it was
well written. However, the comments made backchannel
expressed empathy and understanding with/for the
experience of living and working in a foreign culture
(as a visible minority and guest—working/studying—of
the native population)). Duly noting that the poem
needn’t be a reflection of my personal biases,
opinions, etc, the person suggested that if I was
having a bad day or week, I might have a cup of
coffee. Relax.

Publicly, another person responded with incredulity
and dismay that such a poem might be written,
especially by a “white North American.” ‘White’ is the
accepted shorthand for Caucasian, just as black is for
an incredibly diverse spectrum of hues and colours and
geographic and cultural genealogies and Asian is for
an incomprehensibly diverse spectrum of shapes,
colours, sizes (and cultures!). And so it is perhaps
uninteresting that my skin is literally darker than
the bodies of the very predominately Asian population
it circulates in. That said, let’s talk about bodies,
about skin, about shit, piss, bile and SKII for a
moment. Skin colour is a huge preoccupation (and, of
course, industry) in Taiwan. You mightn’t know this if
you haven’t lived in Taiwan for an extended period as
I have. The poem foregrounds this repeatedly and
explicitly. In Taiwan, following traditional Chinese
concepts of beauty (especially feminine beauty),
lightness is purity, it erases blemishes and faults.
This understanding is one of the foundations of
body-image here. Black foreigners are turned down jobs
in bushibans (cram schools) regularly regardless of
qualifications. My ex-girlfriend was using a textbook
which featured a picture with a black girl in it, and
the class came to a hault as students (9 –12
year-olds) shriveled noses, laughed, and shouted that
she was dirty (w/ one boy suggesting “She is the
poopoo”).

The position of western foreigners in Taiwan permits
the opportunity to provide forms of education, from a
very young age, to a population that is not ethically
diverse. My friends and I take this very seriously and
it assuages some of the negative aspects associated
with being paid to slide one’s tongue down
impressionable throats.

I could go on, but I’m not here as cultural emissary
or go-between. All ambiguity, slipperiness, and irony
aside there is an intractable ugliness in the
automatic-poem under discussion. Not of racism, but of
the Real of cultural interface. And as another list
member living in China noted, the difference between
racism or cultural imperialism and an honest
representation (stress on the RE-presentation) of
culture shock may pass beneath the radar of someone
unfamiliar with living abroad. Sometimes you have to
go there to know there. I don’t mean I know Taiwan
(let alone Asia, Asians, the diaspora, etc) That’s
exactly my point. I don’t. You have to come here to be
truly faced with not-knowing here. The poem was an
enactment of that not-knowing (and I hasten to remind
anyone actually reading this that the “I’ of the poem
is not me and expresses many things I totally disagree
with).

To draw from that some sort of diatribe against
“Asians” is wrong-headed.


PART THREE

I understand defensiveness and indignation in the face
apparent bullying.

When I was young Wayne Gretzky played for the Edmonton
Oilers. I grew up w/ a (perpetually) terminally-ill
brother with Down Syndrome (NOTE: I advise the reader
to skip this section as it’s fairly
confessional/autobiographical). He was 6 years my
senior but we shared a bunkbed, played together, etc.
I didn’t give a fuck about the Oiler’s Stanley Cup
string by and large as I’ve never had any interest in
professional sports. But Patrick lived for hockey
(which he didn’t have the physical capacity to play).
Wayne Gretzky had a locker-room lackey w/ Down
Syndrome named Joey Moss who became a minor celebrity
after his appearance in an TV ad where he blurted
“GREETZKEEEEEE” while vigorously scratching the side
of his head. This vigorous head scratching and shout
became shorthand for “retard” on playgrounds
province-wide. This pained me considerably for a long
time before I wound up and belted a kid, knocking him
off the monkey bars.
 My best friend in elementary school (also named
Andrew) was an evangelical Irish-protestant (I was
raised in a Mennonite church community). He used to
smack kids in the face if they mocked his faith or
took the Lord’s name-in-vain.

But the Buffalo Poetics Listserv is some distance from
a public playground isn’t it?

I’m not for a moment implying anyone has flamed me on
this list, but I believe that it is in our response to
others, particularly to those who injure us, that we
demonstrate maturity. Indeed it may be the well from
which all our political convictions should be drawn.
But what to do with some pseudo-anarchic delinquent
who won’t play fair?

I expected to get a reaction at least something like
the eloquent indignation of Timothy Yu’s, though I had
no one in particular in mind (no gender, colour,
nationality, etc).  It’s often the case that the
moment when we feel most confident about our
convictions and our plan for confronting what we don’t
want to be, that we become it. This is very tired, old
stuff. The War on Terror, religious fanatics,
barbarians, misogynists, etc, the list of signifiers
is endless. But it is not dead stuff and we are not
immune to it as individuals.

I don’t trust those who speak from a position that
pretends to be immune to this basic human condition.
It is what I would call bad faith. If my poem, as
Richard Newman says, suffers from an “underdeveloped
slipperiness” then I must laugh. The poem isn’t
reliably slippery? You can’t drive a cognitive pin
through the thing and say, “Oh, I get it, this
narrator is unreliable, I can’t trust him”?  **Now
that** would be a trite, stupid poem.
What if my intention in writing the poem was a mystery
to me? What if I were merely dwelling in my
frustration with the otherness that surrounds me in
order to bear witness to that frustration (or more
accurately to bear witness to my own bearing witness
of bearing witness to that frustration)?

This isn’t a group therapy session.

But language, at its best, can be.


LAST PART

Now, how about some dialogue?

Timothy, how does ethnicity factor into your poetry,
into your criticism?

When you mention “Asians” or “the Orient”  you make me
feel like this is some homogenous, undifferentiated
mass. It’s surely not news to you that you likely have
more in common with me than my 70 year-old Taiwanese
neighbour.

I have read and re-read Murat Nemet-Nejat’s “Questions
of Accent” as a 25 year-old expat Canuck in Taiwan
(who has made NO attempts to write in Mandarin I
should add); that is, far removed from it’s focal
context. I’m struck by the paradox of that very
Emersonian (and American?) celebration of
non-conformity through which difference and otherness
are integrated into a Standardized America(n language)
in which only the careful reader/poet—the expert—can
discern the folds, interstices, and seams.


Single languages themselves bifurcate between mother
and father tongues for some people. How do others
address or think through the ambiguity of the global
powerhouse of English that we are all ultimately only
passing through?




My best to everyone,

Andrew.

Given, Andrew, that you have disclosed your own sense of your poem's
lameness and mainly provocative intent, I'm not really interested in
discussing these questions, or any of the other questions you have =
raised in
terms of whether the poem adequately raises and/or addresses the issues =
you
say it should be understood as doing. The poem, for me, does not succeed =
as
a poem in any of the terms you define for it. Period. More to the point, =
you
yourself seem more interested in discussing the political and cultural
questions raised by responses to the poem--not, for me anyway, by the =
poem
itself--than you do in whether the poem succeeds as anything other than =
a
piece of provocative writing. Indeed, you suggest--at least I think you
suggest--that you're not really interested in whether it succeeds in
anything other than being provocative, and so what else is there, =
really, to
say about it, since your provocation, clearly, has worked.=20

On the other hand, I spent a good deal of time teaching English in South
Korea and I am very familiar with many of the issues you raise about
cultural differences, how one navigates them, what it feels like when =
that
navigation doesn't work, what it feels like to come home after a day's
living in a place where your face is not reflected back at you from just
about anywhere in the place where you live, what it means to have a =
lover
from that place and how having a lover shapes your responses to your own
responses to living in this place, and so on. These issues you raise or
begin to raise quite interestingly, and in some case movingly, and I =
would
even say importantly, in your prose responses to what people have had to =
say
about the poem. In these responses, you are willing to talk about =
context
and nuance and, most importantly, to position yourself in response to =
what
you have to say in ways that are provocative without being cynical. The
poem, for me, given what you say about it in your full disclosure was a
cynical manipulation into a discussion I would much rather have had in =
the
context of what you have to say in your prose. You may already be =
writing
essays about your experience living and teaching in Taiwan. Those I'd be
interested to read. If you aren't writing these essays, you should =
consider
doing so. You have a lot to say.

Subject:      Cid Corman's Gift
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Maya, Yoichi and I were visiting Cid and Shizumi on Dec. 27th, 2001, and
we decided to stroll down one of Kyoto's most fashional streets to eat
at a favorite Chinese restaurant.  Maya, Yo and Shizumi were walking
ahead and Cid and I were talking about this and that, when Cid suddenly
became animated and "performed" a spontaneous poem in the midst of the
hustle and bustle of Bando-dori!  It was one of the most remarkable
events I've ever witnessed--especially so, since Cid was in the second
half of his seventieth decade when he gave it.  Gesturing to the sky and
to the directions, lifting his voice in measured cadence and moving his
feet with almost a dancer's precision, Cid was a spectacle to behold.
Most of it was lost on the Japanese intent on their daily ritual, but I
recall a mother stopping to stare with her little boy pulled close.
Before any of our crew got a chance to turn around, it was finished, but
I took the time to transcribe what I heard once we got to the
restaurant.  Later I arranged the lines in the form of a poem.  I think
it pretty accurately catches the moment.


It's all poetry
Everything you see is poetry
When I'm writing a poem
& Shizumi comes into the room and interrupts me...

Some poets would get mad, but
It's all poetry
When I'm writing a poem
& A mosquito lands on my nose...

It's all poetry

People have to understand
That we're in the midst of Nothing

Nothing means anything
And this world's dying

Nature is dying
& Will be dead in 100 years
If we're around in 100 years
(Which I doubt
Because man's nature is to destroy himself...

Just look at the ground--it's paved
& The sky--it's clouded over with chemicals
& Those mountains...)

We need so much to control
To our own detriment
But we're in the midst of Nothingness

& Death is always with us
We could die at any time
(I could die right now...)
& People don't want to admit it

& God, if there's an immortal God
Why would he have to do with us?
For his amusement?  We were created
For amusement?

[Gestures]

No, there's Nothing
There's never been anything
But that makes it all the more precious & wonderful

But my poetry, what I say is
So people understand this.  I say it
From the midst of the immediate
I speak it from there
That everything is the most beautiful poem

& Look around you
Just look & you'll see it
Even when I'm not writing it
It's how I say it
& Make it as I say it
Like now...look

Beautiful...beautiful...
That IT IS.

Jesse:

Corman had that rare gift of making the moment true and thus
painful and compelling... and it's taken a similar poet with similar
gifts to bring us such a moment in all its ordinary extraordinariness.

I thank you for taking the time then and now to bring it to me.

Subject:        Cid Corman's Gift
Maya, Yoichi and I were visiting Cid and Shizumi on Dec. 27th, 2001, and
we decided to stroll down one of Kyoto's most fashional streets to eat
at a favorite Chinese restaurant.  Maya, Yo and Shizumi were walking
ahead and Cid and I were talking about this and that, when Cid suddenly
became animated and "performed" a spontaneous poem in the midst of the
hustle and bustle of Bando-dori!  It was one of the most remarkable
events I've ever witnessed--especially so, since Cid was in the second
half of his seventieth decade when he gave it.  Gesturing to the sky and
to the directions, lifting his voice in measured cadence and moving his
feet with almost a dancer's precision, Cid was a spectacle to behold.
Most of it was lost on the Japanese intent on their daily ritual, but I
recall a mother stopping to stare with her little boy pulled close.
Before any of our crew got a chance to turn around, it was finished, but
I took the time to transcribe what I heard once we got to the
restaurant.  Later I arranged the lines in the form of a poem.  I think
it pretty accurately catches the moment.


It's all poetry
Everything you see is poetry
When I'm writing a poem
& Shizumi comes into the room and interrupts me...

Some poets would get mad, but
It's all poetry
When I'm writing a poem
& A mosquito lands on my nose...

It's all poetry

People have to understand
That we're in the midst of Nothing

Nothing means anything
And this world's dying

Nature is dying
& Will be dead in 100 years
If we're around in 100 years
(Which I doubt
Because man's nature is to destroy himself...

Just look at the ground--it's paved
& The sky--it's clouded over with chemicals
& Those mountains...)

We need so much to control
To our own detriment
But we're in the midst of Nothingness

& Death is always with us
We could die at any time
(I could die right now...)
& People don't want to admit it

& God, if there's an immortal God
Why would he have to do with us?
For his amusement?  We were created
For amusement?

[Gestures]

No, there's Nothing
There's never been anything
But that makes it all the more precious & wonderful

But my poetry, what I say is
So people understand this.  I say it
From the midst of the immediate
I speak it from there
That everything is the most beautiful poem

& Look around you
Just look & you'll see it
Even when I'm not writing it
It's how I say it
& Make it as I say it
Like now...look

Beautiful...beautiful...
That IT IS.

Civil Disobediences: Poetics and Politics in Action
Edited by Anne Waldman and Lisa Birman

As cultural absurdities, apathy-inspiring ambient noise, and political and
ecological disasters threaten the 21st-century world, art’s role in
engaging society and coalescing dissent becomes more apparent and more
urgent. Civil Disobediences offers a manual for understanding poetry’s
history and enacting its ultimate power to dismantle and recreate
political and cultural realities.

Composed of essays, lectures, and teaching materials by leading
contemporary poets and scholars, this anthology explores the craft of
poetry as well as the history of poetic/political action in the US and
abroad, the development of ancient and modern poetic forms, the legacy of
world-renowned poets, and the intersections between poetry and
spirituality. It also provides concrete advice about bringing poetry into
your local community and ensuring that “poetry is news that stays news.”

Autobiography of August Spies

    The rebels were victorious at first, but against the united vassals
    of their oppressors they could not stand. At the foot of this mount
    they were defeated, down there, where you see that big rock,
    surrounded by magnificent oaks, the battle for freedom was fought
    and, alas, lost. No, it was not lost, it was merely interceded by a
    temporary victory of the enemy.


<http://victoria.indymedia.org/uploads/august_spies.jpg>

Autobiography of August Spies

   "Barbarians, savages, illiterate, ignorant Anarchists from Central
Europe, men who cannot comprehend the spirit of our free American
institutions,"of these I am one. My name is August Vincent Theodore
Spies, (pronounced Spees). I was born within the ruins of the old
robbers castle Landeck, upon a high mountain's peak (Landeckerberg),
Central Germany, in 1855. My father was a forester (a government
administrator of a forest district); the forest house was a government
budding, and served-only in a different form-the same purposes the old
castle had served several centuries before. The noble Knight-hood of
Highway robbery, the traces of which were still discernable to the
remnants of the old castle, had passed away to make room for more
genteel and less dangerous forms of plunder and robbery, as carried on
in the modern dwelling under the present government. But while the
people from old custom designate this and similar old ruins in the
vicinity as `old Robber Castles," they speak with great deference of the
present government buildings, in which they themselves are daily and
hourly fleeced; they would even, I believe, fight for the maintenance of
these lawful institutions.

   How greatly these "Barbarians" differ from the intelligent American
people! Tell the Americans to fight for the maintenance of our
commercial robbing posts and fleecing institutions- tell them to fight
for the protection of the lawful enterprises of our Board of Trade men;
Merchant princes, Railroad kings, and Factory lords-would they do it?
Alas, more rapidly, I fear, than those "Barbarians from Central Europe,
who cannot comprehend the spirit of our free American institutions."

   Viewed from a historic standpoint my birthplace is quite an
interesting spot. And this is the only excuse I can offer for my
selection of the place for said purpose. I admit I ought not have made
the mistake, ought not have been born a foreigner, but little children,
particularly unborn children, will make mistakes! However, I find no
fault with such wise and intelligent men as Mr. Grinnell and His jury,
for hanging men who were injudicious in the selection of their
birthplace. Sins of this character deserve severe punishment; "society
must protect itself against offenses of this kind."

   But speaking of castle Landeck. Follow me there, reader, on a bright
and clear day. We make our way up the old tower. Take care, or you will
stumble over the debris. That? Oh, that is a piece of an old torture
rack; we found it in one of the subterranean walks, together with
several pieces of old ugly weapons, once used to maintain order among
the victims but why do you shudder? The policeman's outfit of to-day is
not quite so blunt and barbaric, it is true, but it is as effective and
serves the same purpose. So, now, take my hand, I'll help you on top of
the ruin. Look out for the bats. These winged lovers of darkness have
great resemblance with kings, priests and masters in general; they dwell
in the ruins of the "good old times," and become quite noisy when you
disturb them or expose them to the light; adders, too, made this place
their favorable habitation in former years and rendered it very
dangerous for any one to place his sacrilegious foot upon this feudal
monument; we killed them. They were the companions of the bats and owls;
their fate has given the latter much uneasiness, and tears were
entertained that something terrible would happen-that the ghosts of the
old ,noble knights' and 'noble dames' would come back and avenge the
rudeless annihilation of the venerable reptiles, but nothing of the kind
has transpired, I need hardly add that the work of renovation was
greatly impeded by these venomous creatures; since their extermination
we have made remarkable progress

   You smile! Oh, no, I am not speaking of those other reptiles you seem
to think of. But here, we have reached the top. Great view, is it not!
Over there, about thirty minutes walk from here, (west) you see another
ruin like this; that is castle Dreieck, and over there an equal distance
(southwest) you see another one, Wildeck. And now look down in the
fertile valleys, the beautiful meadows and fields and flourishing
villages! Of the latter you can count a dozen, all located around this
mount; and do you know that all these villages and others which have
been laid waste during the thirty years war"' were tributary to the
robbers who ruled over them in these three castles? Yes, the people in
these villages worked all their lives from early dawn till late at night
to fill the vaults of those noble knights, who in return had the
kindness to maintain 'Peace and order'for them. Par example: If one
of these toiling peasants expressed his dissatisfaction of the existing
order of things, if he complained of the heavy and unbearable tasks
placed upon him, 'law and order' demanded that he be placed upon one of
those racks you have seen a relic of, to be tortured into obedience and
submission. 'Society had to protect itself against this class of
criminals.' The noble knights had their Grinnells, Bonfields and
Pinkertons as well as their descendants have them today; and while they
were less civilized than their descendants of our time, they got along
wonderfully well. To accomplish their beneficent objects, they did not
even require the assistance of a Chicago jury.

   Many of the peasants were put to an ignominious death. Some of them
would persist in their folly that it could not be the object of society
nor the intention of Providence to have a thousand good people kill
themselves in a laborious life for the glory, enrichment and grandeur of
a few ungrateful, vicious wretches. Such dangerous teachings were a
menace to society, and their promulgators were unceremoniously stamped out.

   Not more than 200 feet from where we stand there is a perpendicular
(chasm) hole of volcanic origin; it is about 8 feet in length and 3 in
breadth; its depth has never been ascertained. The saying goes that
scores of girls were cast into this terrible abyss by the valiant
Knights during their reign of peace and good order! It is said that
these benevolent "respectables" of ancient times kidnapped the pretty
girls of the villages, carried them like birds of prey to their lofty
abodes, and then when they got tired of them, or found ,,something
better," disposed of them in this way.

   Oh, I see, you shake your heads incredulously! Have you never seen
the dumping grounds of the modern knighthood in our large cities-a
similar abyss? No? It is more frightful than the one I have told you
about; its name is prostitution.

   You don't believe the people would have borne all these outrages-? My
friend, your rebellious spirit carries you away. The "orderly and good
people" suffered these atrocities just as silently as our "law and order
abiding workingmen" bear them today. I told you what happened to those
who showed resistance!

   My words make you sad, turn you pessimistic? Let me show you
something else. Look through these two mounts; can you see a tower in
the dim distance-yes? At the side of this tower are yet to be seen the
ruins of the first chapel built in the realms of the old heathen, but
free and liberty-loving Germans. It was founded by one of the apostles
of St. Boniface, in the eighth century; his name was Lullus. With this
chapel and others that soon followed the poison of Oriental servilism,
the gospel of man's degradation, resignation and asceticism was first
introduced. The old Cherutker and Katten, who had in mortal combat
thrust the Roman eagle to the ground, were less successful in resisting
the mind infecting poison of pestilential Rome; it came flowing in
incessantly through the channels of the Christian church. It is true,
the healthy and robust Germans were not an easy prey to the pessimistic
belief of a debauched and dying race-(Rome) they never have been good
Christiansbut they became sufficiently infected to lose their
consciousness and pride of manhood for a while, to fall into the
despairing vagaries of the Orient, and as a natural consequence into
serfdom. If life had no value, why then aspire to liberty? Friend, the
ruins of yonder chapel is the monument of an epoch that gave birth to
such robberburgs as the one we stand upon. The people would have raised
these roosts to the ground long before they did, if the priest had not
stood between them and "Law and Order." The priest is an essential
indivisible part of the despot and oppressor; he is the conciliatory
link between them and their victims.

   These two ruins, once sacred as the pedestals of social order, are
prophetic monuments. Man will so stand upon the ruins of the present
order and will say as you say now-"was it possible !"

   But now turn around-along this mountain chain, northeast, there,
where the earth dips mistily into the horizon, the periphery of our
view-do you see yonder gray spot, it looks like a small cloud? Yes?
That's the Wartburg, you have heard of Wartburg. It was here, where Dr.
Martinus Luther lived and worked, an instrument of the revolutionary
forces; the revolutionary forces, my friend, that gradually had
developed in these villages.

   It is our custom to attribute great movements to single individuals,
as being their merit. This is always wrong and it was so with Luther.
The Germanic race could not digest the Byzantinian philosophy as
embodied in the Judaic and Christian teachings. The idea that this world
was calculated to be simply a purgatory and our life a martyrdom was
repulsive to them, was that servitude and despotism were growing from
the seed of the new religion and developing, where once had been the
habitation of liberty; developing at such a rate, that patience ceased
to be a virtue. The rebellious spirit of the people. their animosity to
the doctrine of self-abnegation, imposed upon them by the church, had
been successfully calmed and suppressed by the priests for several
centuries. But as the iniquties of the "nobility," and the domestic
burdens of the people grew unbearable this spirit burst out in flames,
and in Luther found a crystallization point.

   From the Wartburg then the mighty wave of the reformation rolled
forth. It was the Occident struggling in self- preservation against the
Orient. The love of liberty which had been lying spellbound in the
people's heart for generations, now flowed out in lucid streams; the
magic spell was broken But the "nobility," while they wanted liberation
from the despotism of the Roman Church, they liked the privileges the
latter had given them; the patent to rob the peasants of their labor too
well-they scorned the idea of the common people aspiring to economic
freedom. Was not "spiritual liberty," a change of certain religious
notions, enough for any common man? Luther soon became the tool of these
cheating knaves, and wielded his pen in condemnation of the objects
contended for by the people. He denounced the true and brave leaders of
the people, the fearless Thomas Muenzer and his associates, worse than
the Pope had denounced him shortly before.

   And when the liberty-thirsty people finally took up their scythes and
axes and forks, and drove the "noble Knights" from their robbers'
roosts, it was Luther who brought about a vast conspiracy of the latter
against the people. It is characteristic that now all religious
differences were set aside and all petty tyrants combined to subdue the
people. Papist or Lutheran, all were instantly united in the crusade
against labor. (America at this time presents an analagous spectacle:
Republicans and Democrats "embrace each other as Nectar and Ambrosia,"
wherever labor rises for emancipation.)

   Of course, the people were conspirators and incendiaries. Hear what
Thomas Muenzer said:---Lookyou, the sediment of the soup of usury, theft
and robbery are the Great, the masters. they take all creatures as their
property, the fish in the water, the birds in the air; and the
vegetation of the earth. And then they preach God's commandment to the
poor; 'Thou shall not steal.' But this is not for themselves. They bone
and scrape the poor farmer and mechanic until these have nothing left,
then, when the latter put their hands on the sacred things, they are
hanged. And Doctor Liar says, Amen! The masters do it themselves. that
the poor man hates them. The cause of the rebellion they won't abolish,
how then can things change to the better. And I say this, I am an
incendiary-let it be so!" No, these words were not spoken in Judge
Gary's court! You make a mistake, reader, the language is not modern,
it's 400 years old And the man who used it was in the right. He
interpreted the Gospel, saying that it did not merely promise blessings
in heaven, but that it also commanded the equality and brotherhood among
men on earth. The champions of law and order and Christendom chopped his
head off.

   The rebels were victorious at first, but against the united vassals
of their oppressors they could not stand. At the foot of this mount they
were defeated, down there, where you see that big rock, surrounded by
magnificent oaks, the battle for freedom was fought and, alas, lost. No,
it was not lost, it was merely interceded by a temporary victory of the
enemy.

peace

what i should have said was a version of muhammad's speech was dilvered
after the hajj when the incidents occured with usama.

the speech below (below the poem to usama) was an assembly of words
offered by the prophet in 632 A.C., 9th day of Dhul al Hijjah, 10 A.H..
The prophet was to die a few months after and it is duirng his illness
where the controversy occured with usama and the older tribal companions.

aply ogies

Subject:      Re: WHY DO THE TIAWANESE
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Andrew:

I must say that despite your very thorough attempts to explain what
your intentions were in writing "WHY DO THE TIAWANESE," I'm still
pretty confused about them.  You seem to dismiss the poem itself as
"lame" and suggest very strongly that it was intended primarily as a
provocation--that you were hoping, even expecting, to get a reaction
like the one I provided.  (Why?  So that you could play "gotcha" when
the inevitable cry of racism went up?)  This would suggest that the
poem's content was quite consciously chosen to offend--that it was
written in full awareness of the way it could easily be seen as a
piece of racist writing; in short, that it was merely a carrier of
provocative payload, rather than a work of art.  And at the same time
you claim that the poem does in some way represent "the Real" of your
cultural experience as a white Canadian in Taiwan--in other words,
that it is not only a well-crafted poem but a very good one.

The hypothetical "situations" you describe imply, if I am not
mistaken, that my reading of your poem is akin to racist behavior,
because my reading proceeds from knee-jerk assumptions about the
poem's rhetoric and about your intentions.  You also suggest that
your position as a white Canadian in an overwhelmingly ethnically
Chinese country makes you a "visible minority" (to use that Canadian
phrase that has always puzzled me), analogous to the position of
non-white racial groups in Canada or the U.S.  In other words, that
there is a perfect symmetry between your own position and that of a
racial minority here at home, and that because of that we ought to
empathize with and respect your position.

But these arguments are false.  Racism is in fact a profound
asymmetry--not just in politics and economics but in ideology and
discourse, and not just nationally but globally.  As a white
English-speaking Canadian, you enter a place like Taiwan as someone
who possesses a valuable commodity--your language itself--and are
hence granted a certain level of authority, as you know from your
role as a teacher.  And you are also clearly aware that people in
Asia are quite capable of making a fetish of whiteness itself,
viewing it as a standard of beauty and power.  This is a position
radically different than, say, that of an Asian immigrant to the U.S.
or Canada, who, even if he or she possesses the same level of
education you do, likely has no skill or trait regarded as valuable
save raw labor-power, and whose cultural and linguistic difference is
regarded not as an asset but as an insurmountable barrier to
assimilation.  And it is certainly different than that of, say, the
second- or third-generation Asian American, who may in every way be
culturally indistinguishable from his or her white peers but who
continues to be racialized, regarded as a foreigner.  Unlike you,
most racial minorities have no other home to go to except where they
are.

Given that you purport to critique all kinds of racial assumptions
and essentialism, I find it remarkable that you seek to defend your
poem by appealing to the authenticity of your own experiences in
Taiwan, implying that the rest of us are simply too ignorant to
understand your writing: "you have to go there to know there."  Well,
the two people who have criticized you on this list do have such
experience.  That I may have more in common with you than with your
Taiwanese neighbor is precisely the point; I visited Taiwan several
times as a teenager and lived there for a year, and experienced the
same kinds of cultural shocks and confusions you report having.
Indeed, these shocks were even more bizarre for me, since I
experienced them in a society where everyone did, after all, "look
like me," even if I did not speak the language or participate in the
culture.  So I think I do have the requisite experience to understand
what you are talking about.  That I do not, despite that, write poems
that sound like your tirade suggests that maybe race does matter.  My
critique proceeds not from an identification of myself with a
resident of Taiwan, but from my position as an Asian American who
sees exactly how your rhetoric will play to the home crowd.

You ask how ethnicity factors into my own writing.  That's really
more for others to decide.  I have an essay in the latest issue of
_Meanjin_, "How to Write a Chinese Poem," that has some bearing on
that question, and if you are so inclined you can read it or the blog
entry from which the essay is drawn
(http://tympan.blogspot.com/2003_04_01_tympan_archive.html#93164632).
My larger point, though, is that the role of race in my writing is
something that vastly exceeds my own intentions; whatever I think I
am doing, the writing enters into and participates in a larger
discourse in ways I might never anticipate.  What seems to me like a
pure poem of personal experience--or, in my case, a parody of such a
poem--may be read by a wider audience as a profound statement of the
Asian American condition, and/or may serve to ratify the most
invidious stereotypes of Asians.  The best I can do is try to be
aware of how this may happen--of how racial discourse is always
already in operation--and try not simply to be used by it.

That's why, in the final analysis, I can have no sympathy for your
defense of your poem as a testament to real personal experience, or
by the statement (which I have no reason to doubt) that the speaker
of the poem is not you.  If such defenses were adequate, every
pinhead senator who spouted slurs against blacks or gays or Asians
would be immediately absolved upon uttering the cynical words, "I did
not intend to offend anyone" or "I was not speaking of an entire
group."  The point is that such rhetoric participates in and ratifies
a racist discourse, one that a speaker cannot disavow simply by
disavowing the *intention* of causing harm.  And this is the final
asymmetry: this is why the statement "All Taiwanese eat dogs" is not
the same as the statement "All Americans carry guns."  The latter may
be an erroneous national stereotype, but it is not racist, especially
when uttered on an American listserv; the former, especially when
uttered on an American listserv, is racist, because it is connected
to a characteristic seen here not as national but racial (it's
Jessica Hagedorn, a Filipino American writer, who has a book
defiantly called _Dogeaters_) and because it is meant to place that
race outside the realm of the civilized or human (food taboos being
one of the most fundamental markers of a culture).

So when you assert that the Taiwanese care only about science and not
the humanities--even if you have some statistical evidence to support
this (though I doubt anyone who has spent time in an American
university is much more sanguine about American students' attitude
toward the humanities)--you play into and ratify, however distantly,
the structure of belief that leads a college recruiter at a job fair
to hand me a brochure for the college's engineering school even
before I have opened my mouth.  When you portray the Taiwanese as
supplicants at the altar of global English, you play into and ratify
the beliefs of the student in my Stanford classroom who expresses
incredulity at the quality of my English.  And when you put such
assertions in the structure of a "lame" poem that provides no
perspective from which such assertions can be critiqued, you play
right into that structure of racism, whether you intend to or not.  I
don't need to turn "Asians" or "the Orient" into one "homogeneous,
undifferentiated mass," as you put it; other folks are already doing
that for, and to, me.

I'm going to England from July 7th  to maybe the 22nd.  Does anyone know of
poetry open mikes (or readings by famous people) or other literary events?
I'll probably be in London until the 11th, then off to Nottingham for a
conference and then wherever I want to go after that.

I tried searching the web, but it's hard to tell what different events are
like from online listings.

Thanks.

IMF Warns Its New Grift of Iraq 'Imminent':
"Under U.S./IMF Tutelage, Iraq Will Be Another Haiti In No Time." 'Dr.
Death' Negroponte Tells Hungry Bankers At Conference In Transylvania

By MARTINETTE CRUDSLINGER





They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Hi,
I don't have cable tv so this list is one of my ways of watching america.
I read this on Counterpunch and I wonder if it's true.

" Here in the
States there is now a trend of wearing red on Fridays in silent protest of
the Bush junta. Reportedly, this is modeled after a 1940 practice by
citizens of Nazi occupied Norway, though it is hard to imagine why
oppressed Norwegians would do anything that might make them stand out to
their oppressors. Still, urban legend or not, it's all over the Internet
and one would suppose quite a few people on the "left-coast" are sporting
red. By now, it's probably old hat out there."

http://counterpunch.org/bageant07012004.html

is this true?

and how come reports on Orono? is it all on blog land?

bests,
kevin

Timothy,

I have only been catching only bits of this and  missed the beginning
of the tread.. but I started scanning this morning and was totally
engaged...

though I think it is for an intended for one, or a public act of great
importance that unfortunately has to be repeated over and over.

so, thank you for your time and words and yet I am guessing, a somewhat
painful gift, to always be put in the position of educator of racism,
or that could be my projection... I hope you do not feel alone in your
position, I hope you do not feel like the soul educator of racism on
this list.........

thank you again..

Reading the Chronicle piece moved me to write a brief note of my own,
which I'll paste below.  I love the picture with Carl, Enslin, Duncan, and
King, with Carl holding forth and the whole scene looking like one of
those slomo walkin' shots signifying groop coolness in recent "hip"

Dear Julian Guthrie-Thank you for your sensitive tribute to Carl Rakosi.
Your portrait brought back a flood of memories from the time I spent with
him during a few memorable encounters.  I met him at the University of
Virginia, when I was a grad student working on the Objectivist movement,
and he was a wry and spry 88 years old.  We hit it off right from the
start, and did an interview together that was eventually published in the
journal Sagetrieb.  Soon after that first meeting, we encountered on
another again, during a poetry conference at the University of Maine,
Orono, where I had the pleasure of introducing him at a joint reading he
did with Allen Ginsberg.  That was a great evening of poetry-vibrating the
air with warmth, humanity, and excitement.  Always buoyant, Carl would
always rise a little further on the occasions when he read his poetry.
But even the casual chats I had with him in the school's dining hall, or
in the hallways between poetry events, were notable for the liveliness and
warmth of his manner.  He always had intelligent and insightful comments
at the ready, but he also looked you in the eye and listened to what you
had to say-a "good guy" indeed.  Like so many others, I'll sorely miss his
presence (even though I hadn't seen him for years), but will turn with
gratitude to the wit and grace of the poetry.

Sincerely,
Steve Shoemaker
Harvard University

HERE'S ONE BY BARRY SCHWABSKY AND SIMON SMITH

with Simon Smith and Barry Schwabsky

Simon Smith's new book Reverdy Road
published by Salt Publishing.
www.saltpublishing.com/books/smp/1844710270.htm

"Listen up to Simon Smith's London phonemes in a lyric serial that commutes
gods, toast, half light, loss, concrete, poetry, phones and angels from poem to
poem. What will happen next memory asks. A sharp poetic intelligence answers,
at work and love in the spliced expression, quick emotion, tried and untested
reasons." Peter Middleton

Barry Schwabsky's new books [ways] and Opera
published by Meritage Press.

"Imagine poems written by Sir Walter Raleigh after he has read Wittgenstein
and Lorine Neidecker, listened to bands whose names weren't in the air but
whose one song was on the airwaves, and learned more about contemporary art than
anyone thought possible, and you might get a sense of the compactness of these
poems, an airy abstract density unlike anyone else's." John Yau

Yes I think Tim's remarks are a great gift to this list - and, ideally, can
be again amplified beyond the reach here.
In no way, trying to compromise what Tim has to say, Andrew's
flipped-outness - at least it seems to me - resembles a real dark phase of
"culture shock", in the case of which where one becomes deeply immersed in
another culture and comes to realize one is not in charge and one's
vocabularies no longer work, etc. I have seen many freak out (as in your
poem. Etc.) or (minimally) spend the rest of their expat time downgrading,
complaining etc. about the local.   At medium best, the indigenous are
patient, or at least try to work with you in terms of your intended value as
a guest. (I remember - in 1960 - the Nigerian Government deported a first
group Peace Corps Volunteer who - on a postcard - wrote about some open
garbage on a Lagos Street). And let's not even begin to talk about Insurgent
responses to USA Occupation in Iraq.
 At real best, overtime and with humility and a lot of work, a different
kind of chemistry or dialogue takes place in which one and "the other" get
to a much more interesting zone.

So for Andrew, if I may, I would suggest either return to Canada or  cool it
until this weird  'hysteric authority' disappears and see what then appears.

Actually I liked the poem. One of its good points is that it is not meant
for inner consumption only but for a larger world where North America is
occupying today a very specific, and vulnerable, place. Vulnerable in terms
of what kind of opinions other people hold about it. Not flattering
opinions, not in the least, I should say. I am not an American or Canadian
and this poem is relevant for me. Peoples and nations outside the US, or
the West in general, (strangly the poem sounds American rather than
Canadian to a foreign ear) have to deal with the presence of this enormous
blind power on the earth. The poem shows the way of being an Amerinadian or
Canarican that seldom reveals itself in contemporary poetry. It is not
about the Taiwanese, 'Taiwanes' could be replaced by dozens or even
hundreds of other ethnicities. it is, to a much greater extent, about
Americans and Canadians. The poem says something like: "I am rich and
pampered and powerful and impatient and I do not understand how you guys
can be otherwise, In my mind I can understand everything and preach all
kinds of noble ideas but in my unmeditated and unconscious reactions to
things different here is what I am, irritable, unaccepting of difference
and it is not in my power to control those feelings. They are gut feelings.
Deal with them. " And it says much more because there is distance between
the person who speaks and the author.

FYI - In case you have not seen/hear about this notice - below - of an event
for the NY Republican invention. The only alternative - and not likely
protest step - for editorial emphasis would be to turn out all the lights in
NY each night of the convention (maybe it is an 'invention" - just saw what
I wrote!). It's felt like that dark with these folks already so long.

Happy Independence Day!

Welcome to the Douglas Kelley Show List
http://dks.thing.net/
art openings and stuff
(This is that other stuff.)


Dear Unidentified Friends and Relations, Casual Acquaintances and
Befuddled Curmudgeons of The Douglas Kelley Show List,

The great Milton Glazer. the legendary talent who is both Thomas Edison
and Keith Richards of graphic design, fine Art and illustration and pop
publishing, whose natural gift for mass-marketing and pithy right-on
politics has come out with a very elegant solution to how New Yorkers
and their friends and loved ones can create a joyous, but visually
significant and beautifully nonviolent protest against the Republican
National Convention and what it represents. http://lightupthesky.org/

Through the DKS and the galleries I want to get a lot of the big time
big name artists involved with this, and to this end, I am sending this
out to you all as a feeler? The idea is simple- wander around your usual
haunts on the night of August 30th, 2004 carrying anything and
everything that will give off light and show you're thinking about peace
not war. Thank you very much, I think the rest is self explanatory. It
appeared on the Nation day before yesterday. http://lightupthesky.org/ -DK

Light Up the Sky
by Milton Glaser

http://lightupthesky.org/

from the NATION July 12, 2004 issue
This article can be found on the web at
http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040712&s=glaser


Milton Glaser, a longtime friend of The Nation and the designer behind
the ""I Love NY"" campaign, is back with a new idea: He proposes that
New Yorkers welcome the GOP in August with a display of light. The plan
emerges from a desire to show anger at what the GOP and the Bush
Administration have done to our city, our nation and the world, while
avoiding violent confrontations that could help the GOP in November. We
urge readers to spread the word about this bright, peaceful and creative
protest against the darkness of the Bush agenda (go to
http://lightupthesky.org to download or e-mail,
jessi@lightupthesky.org), and we hope those in the New York area will
help light up the sky on August 30.

With all due respect, is this a joke? Republicans are really going to feel
the heat if the lights are on? Give me a break. It's a way out to give
liberals an out for not showing up in the streets next month. As long as the
lights are on. That'll show 'em.

And the laughs get louder still.

On the contrary: the poem strikes me as entirely for "inner
consumption."  Andrew has already conceded that he would not have
circulated the poem anywhere except on this list, since in the larger
world its utterances would have been read as clearly racist.  (Unlike
here, I suppose, where we are too sophisticated for such judgments.)
I don't see much evidence that it is about positioning the
U.S./Canada in a larger world or how it exposes North American
vulnerability.  Certainly it is not meant to be read by the Taiwanese
who are its ostensible subject, since it is written in an English
from which they are depicted as alienated.

The real problem here, though, is the assertion that the poem is "not
about the Taiwanese"--that the "Taiwanese" are merely an empty
signifier that demonstrates American/Canadian ignorance.  Perhaps the
poem would like to imagine itself reaching such a level of
abstraction.  But it is precisely the poem's specificity--the
knowingness with which it plays upon anti-Asian stereotypes--that
makes it what it is, and makes it so repugnant.  The wealth of
biographical detail Andrew has provided to back up the poem suggests
that we should read it as nothing less than a Canadian's reaction to
Taiwan.  To say that "Taiwan" simply means nothing off this poem is
essentially to empty the entire poem of its content, to let it off
the hook, to evade responsibility.  If anything, this interpretation
would make my reaction to the poem even more negative: the Taiwanese
are just there to be (further) exploited, caricatured solely for the
purposes of making some abstract point.  They would matter not at
all.  I don't think even Andrew believes that.

Finally, I see no distance between "the person who speaks" and "the
author" here.  That does not mean that I see all of the poem's
phrases being uttered by Andrew Loewen.  What it does mean is that
the framing mechanisms that would allow us to distinguish a speaker
from an author--that would allow us to regard this as something like
a dramatic monologue--are absent.  We can read this poem as
self-critical only by a wholesale act of negation--by "flipping" the
whole thing and suggesting that it is all meant as a condemnation of
what it purports to endorse--and not because of its gaps or its
unstable ironies or because it sets up any kind of place within
itself where we might stand and grasp the failures of its logic.

While Timothy's thinking and writing are eloquent, well-stated, and lucid, I
can't help but feel that he's indulging in paranoia in imagining that the
North American white readership will respond to this as a reaction to all of
Asia, lumped together. I can't agree with him when he says "I
am--preemptively, as it were--eliding 'Taiwan' with 'Asia' or 'the
Orient' because that is precisely what happens as the images you use enter
American discourse". He may be right that American discourse can support
little distinction between Taiwanese and Asian, but the fact that the poem
uses Taiwanese (or variably Tiawanese, which I really saw as just an
occasional typo) means that the poem is--even in its oddball way--going
beyond the borders of American discourse. "Asian" as an identity only means
something in the diaspora, where elite high schools and colleges have
student organizations filled with kids surnamed Li, Sasaki, and Kim. The
Chinese word for "Asia" itself is a translation from the european languages,
and literally means--if you break it down by character, though few Chinese
speakers bother to think of it this way--"Secondary Continent". Why would
anyone in China want to identify with Asia if it made them ipso-facto
secondary?

And while I can philosophically comprehend, from a consideration of power
dynamics, why Timothy would say "this is the final asymmetry: this is why
the statement 'All Taiwanese eat dogs' is not the same as the statement 'All
Americans carry guns.'" But from a personal view, as an American who has
both eaten dog (doesn't taste like chicken) and has had Chinese people,
searching for a conversation topic, start talking to me about how cool guns
are, I don't see it that way. Sure, "All Americans carry guns" is not
racist, but then neither is, in and of itself, "All Taiwanese eat dogs."
I'll grant that "All Taiwanese eat dogs" can _become_ racist in specific
contexts (and I'm not exactly defending Andrew's
it's-on-the-poetics-list-so-it's-okay point, either), but the words
themselves can and often do remain pretty neutral, even if exaggerated
(because a lot of Taiwanese don't eat dogs, just as a lot of Americans don't
own--let alone carry--guns).

What's interesting to me is the theoretical assumptions of the criticisms
and defences of Andrew's poem. I've always believed myself to side with
reader-response and death-of-the-author, but if that means following
Timothy's racist-because-of-the-american-context, then I guess I'll have to
re-think my Barthes and Fish. Basically, I think it's got to be very hard
for a foreigner in any country not to have very similar reactions to those
stated in Andrew's poem. A Canadian in Taiwan shouts,

WHY DO THE TIAWANESE
           feed their young to techno-capitalism

and

WHY DO THE TIAWANESE
           hate the air

and

WHY DO THE TAIWANESE
           run over dogs like nothing

and

WHY DO THE TAIWANESE
           want to pay my student loans

where a French person in America shouts "Why do the Americans feed
techno-capitalism to their young? Why do Americans hate the air? Why are
Americans so fat? And why do I want to study English and work in America and
make a lot of money?" Not only does the end of Andrew's poem break free of
the simplistic complaints about Taiwanese popular culture, but in so doing
it gives us a hint to the symbiotic relationship between ruler and ruled
we've been warned about: I hate them, but I cannot leave them. And in saying
this, not only is it unclear who now is ruling and who is ruled, but we also
have a much more tempered hatred, which might even one day break into love.
Who knows?

None of this is to say that I'm wild about the poem. It makes me feel
uncomfortable, and for a very different reason why I think it makes Timothy
uncomfortable. Part of it is that I don't like a rant as a poem, and part of
it is that I'm too much of a Modernist to want poetry accompanied with an
explanation, by the poet, of what "the author is trying to say". But there's
more going on in there than Timothy is willing to give it credit for.
Particularly, that it's a poem--as I read it, anyway--about culture shock,
and not about imperialism.

thanks jonathan penton for finally sending me this poem unworthy of
anyone's attention thanks to mr yu for all his incites to andrew for his

tiawanese/taiwanese can be replaced w/anything  ala why not rhinoceri or
why not chirkendooses or these tibetan monk(ie)s i'm listening to on the

Listen to a one hour documentary produced at CKUT Radio in Montreal,
which explores the ongoing indigenous struggle on the Mohawk territory
of Kanehsatake. In recent months the indigenous community of
Kanehsatake, located just outside of Montreal, Quebec has been a focal
point for indigenous self-determination struggles in North America
(Turtle Island).

This 1 hour documentary highlights the recent developments of the
political struggle of Kanehsatake, focusing on the ongoing efforts of
Kanehsatake community members to resist a possible multi-police force
invasion, combined of Provincial, Federal and Kanehsatake police.

The community of Kanehsatake's resistance to this invasion and
implementation of a largely unpopular Mohawk policing agreement, is
viewed by many in Kahehsatake as an attack on indigenous
self-determination. The documentary begins with speeches which were
given at a solidarity rally held in Kanehsatake on May 20th, the rally
brought together Mohawk people and supporters from across Quebec and
Ontario.

Seems to me there are at least two, and maybe three or four, fundamentally
different but still related questions that are being conflated in discussion
of Andrew's poem, and since they are, all of them, important in terms of
both poetry per se and larger political and cultural issues, I think it's
worth taking the time to separate them.



1.      First, there is the question of whether Andrew's poem works as a
poem, whether he has written it in such a way that it communicates what he
wants it to communicate in its content, regardless of how that content is
understood by others. My own first impression, as well as Timothy's-and
probably Andrew's as well, based on his own assessment of the poem as lame
and something he would not have posted elsewhere-was that it did not. (I'm
not going to say anything about the responses that have been posted since
Andrew's autobiographical commentary, since it's impossible for me, or for
anyone, to know the degree to which those responses were shaped by Andrew's
disclosures.) We could not, for example, have known from the poem that it
was written by a Canadian living and working in Taiwan, a context that I
think would have made a difference in how I understood the poem; nor could
we have known that some of the things in the poem which, to me anyway,
appeared simply as part of the rant-for example, the line about Taiwanese
keeping things in their basement, when, as Andrew pointed out, Taiwanese
houses/buildings don't have basements-were in fact accurate descriptions
about Taiwan. At the very least, this lack of context means that there was
no way I could have read the poem with the specificity Andrew clearly, based
on his later explanations and commentary, wanted it to be read. And so, for
me, the poem does not work, and one of the ways in which I would
characterize this "not-working" is Andrew's abdication of responsibility as
the writer of the poem to make this specificity clear in whatever way would
make sense within the context of the poem. In other words, if he wanted the
poem to be read as being spoken by someone going through a particularly
difficult stage of culture shock, then there should have been something in
the poem to make that clear; if he wanted there to be a distinction in the
poem, and for people to make a distinction in reading the poem, between
culture shock and racism (about which more below), then there should have
been something in the poem to make that clear. And these devices I am saying
should have been in there would not need to have been obvious or didactic;
they could have been subtle and open to misreading-as all poems are
anyway-and they might still have been unsuccessful, but they would have been
there and we would then be arguing about whether those devices worked, not
whether we should be granting either Andrew or the poem the benefit of the
doubt because of what he has chosen to reveal about the poem after the fact.
2.      Related to this is the question of what the consequences are of this
lack of context for how the use of the word Taiwanese and the specific
questions about the Taiwanese are understood. In the absence of Andrew's
disclosures about himself and his intentions for the poem, it is true that
the word Taiwanese-misspelled or otherwise-could be replaced by just about
anything, but that does not make it not-racist. Imagine replacing the word
with "the Jews" or "the Blacks" or any other group whose otherness has been
racialized. Few of us who belong to those groups, I think, would stand for
it-unless there was a context that made the use of the group meaningful
beyond being a mere cipher for otherness. More to the point, the idea that
any group's name-racial, national or otherwise-and therefore identity and
cultural specificity, can be used with impunity as a decontextualized cipher
is one that should give us pause. Not because there isn't a way in which
different groups who have been treated as "other" do not share similar
experiences-there is, after all, a way in which racism is racism no matter
who the object of racial hatred happens to be-but because such
decontextualization is precisely one of the privileges that dominant groups
arrogate to themselves. It is, to use my own experience in the US as an
example, what happens-or at least what used to happen when well-meaning
white liberals would talk about the need for "us all" to be color-blind
without realizing that what they really meant by color-blindness was that
we, meaning white people, should treat everyone, and everyone else should
think of themselves, as if they were white. Other consequences, again, given
the lack of specificity: if we do not know that the poem is spoken by
someone undergoing culture shock, a particularly hard case of it, and if
there is no way in the poem for the reader, especially a reader who has
never experienced culture shock, to gain a critical distance from the
culture shock being experienced by the speaker and out of which, and in
response to which, the speaker is speaking, how is it possible for those
questions in Andrew's poem which do, in fact, either state or play on racist
stereotypes not to be read as unadorned restatements of those stereotypes?
In other words, absent Andrew's commentary and explanation, it is hard for
me to see how you can read the poem as not doing precisely what Timothy
describes it as doing in racial terms, even if it is also possible-though I
will admit this possibility is for me a real stretch-to imagine a different,
potentially non-racist, reading. Like it or not, the poem participates in
and perpetuates racist discourse in a racist way precisely because there
does not seem to be a consciousness in the poem itself that the discourse is
racist.
3.      Which brings me to the third question, which I think is very
interesting, but is essentially separate from consideration of Andrew's poem
as a poem: the relationship between the kind of culture shock Andrew
describes and which some responses to the poem have suggested is common to
anyone who lives in a country/culture/language context not their own and
racism. It is true that culture shock is not in and of itself racism, but
that does not mean that because it is culture shock it does not remain
untouched by racists stereotypes and imaginings. I lived in South Korea as
an English teacher for a total of about 18 months, and I remember well what
it was like to come home and be shocked by the image in the mirror of my
bearded, Eastern-European, what people in the States call obviously
Jewish-looking face after a day of living in a society where not one single
image that I saw around me reflected who I was. On some level, I'd
"forgotten" what I looked like. And I remember as well the difficulty of
dealing with Koreans' emphasis on the harmony of the group over the feelings
of the individual. And of the ways in which I was racialized and treated as
an oddity. Old women on the subway would come up to me and stroke the hair
on my arms because it was such a strange thing for them, my otherness
providing permission for them to cross social boundaries they would not
otherwise cross. And I also remember how difficult it was for me at first to
separate the sexualized racist stereotypes of Asian women that I could not
have helped inheriting from my own culture from the real women I met, and
especially those with whom I have relationships, sexual and otherwise. And
how easy it was for me to "read" the women I met who worked in the sex trade
there in terms of those stereotypes-it was impossible not to socialize with
my Korean male friends and not meet these women. And I remember well my own
frustrations with feeling misunderstood by people I felt I could barely
understand, and how angry I became when I could not escape my own outsider
status. And so on and so on and so on. If I had been in France or some other
country where the people looked more like me, about which there was not the
kind of racist stereotyping that goes on in the US about Asians, I might
have felt very similar things, but I would not have had racist stereotypes
through which to express those feelings. In Korea, I had those stereotypes,
and I would be lying if I said I did not on occasion use them to talk about
and feel through the culture shock I was experiencing. Andrew may have been
trying to write something about culture shock in his poem; the fact that
culture shock is not in and of itself racist, however, does not mean that
the culture shock Andrew expresses in the poem is not informed by the racism
of his own culture, whether or not he is actively, consciously a racist, and
so I come back to my original point about why the poem fails to do what
Andrew says he wants it to do: there is no consciousness within the poem
that attends to these complexities and for the poem to do what Andrew wants
it to, such a consciousness needs to be present. Otherwise, the poem, as a
poem, not as a stand-in for Andrew, or as a comment on anything other than
itself, cannot escape its own racism.

Dear Buffalo Listers

My book Circular Descent is now available from Blaze Vox books. I want to
thank Geoffrey Gatza, Editor for believing in this project he is a good
friend and a good editor and I am in his debt. I am going to be reading
Circular Descent at various venues over the next six months starting with
Woodland Pattern in Milwaukee on August 20th, 2004 in the Red Letter series
where I am reading with my friend William Allegrezza. I want to thank Stacy
Szymanzek for this opportunity. The link for sale of my book is above.

Many of the poems in this book have been influenced by many of you in
Brazil, Bolivia, Dallas, New York and Chicago. A poet's work is never
created in a vacuum and I am fortunate to have had such a great and
stimulating group of poets as friends to influence my work along with a life
rich in experiences, and languages.

I want especially to thank Peter Gizzi, Catherine Daly, and Mark Tardi for
the blurbs I am humbled by them and I also want to thank Charles Bernstein,
Pierre Joris and Kerri Sonnenberg for reading the manuscript. I also want to
thank Waltraud Haas, my wife for the cover art. I hope to see many of you at
readings this fall and around Chicago and other places as well.

Advance Praise for
Circular Descent

At the dangerous intersection of Liberty and Empire, Raymond Bianchi breaks
the sound barrier. These “multi-colored sequences” are up to date
heart-breaking cubistic international songs in “real time,” trafficking in
corporate corruption and working people, desire and everyday life. This is
wild and honest work. -- PETER GIZZI

This political and poetical post-existential, post-noir writing speaks
through an interrelated host of filmmakers, cultural historians, and other
artists. Bianchi's recombinatory prose poetics results in recognizably
formal repetition and variation,"and he would be remarkable" for these
sprawling stanzas set with intersections and identifications drawn from the
catholicity of America's most Catholic city, Chicago.-- CATHERINE DALY

Finally a book of poetry that contains more than dancing skeletons or sighs
at sunset, Ray Bianchi's CIRCULAR DESCENT spins with knee-breaking
centrifugal force. The sheer scope is staggering -- Marcel Duchamp,
Catholicism, the Cold War, butchers, suburban sprawl, steelmill workers,
Saddam Hussein, and the 1917 White Sox -- and surely somewhere Witold
Gombrowicz and Viktor Shklovsky are smiling. Bianchi's a startingly original
writer and CIRCULAR DESCENT radiates with the intensity of "Bull Connor's
firehoses ripping Andy Warhol's hair off by the root." -- MARK TARDI

I have a lot of poems about female artists in my first book (DaDaDa,
Salt, 2003) -- one of those is online at m.a.g.; of the painters, many
of these poems are partially based on collections of their paintings
online & in well known books (mostly of female artists, California
artists, outsider artists).

It was great fun giving them the book! to -- extra bonus writing about
work of alive people.

    LAST OF THE COACH-HOUSE CULTURE FACTORIES

    By=A0John Barber
     Saturday, July 3, 2004
    =20

    There once was a golden age when culture occurred in the laneways of centra=
    l
    Toronto. Every other coach house in the Annex was an experimental theatre;
    one on the University of Toronto campus turned into Marshall McLuhan's
    chaotic but imposingly named Centre for Culture and Technology, the scruffy
    headquarters for what became a worldwide revolution in communications
    theory, shoved out of sight by a disapproving university administration.

    Most coach-house culture withered when the window boxes arrived. The rough
    laneway laboratories became pretty and banal, scourged by gentrification.
    But at 401 Huron Street (Rear), probably the most famous address in Canadia=
    n
    letters, culture still happens, miraculously unmolested. The Coach House
    Press has been making books there for almost 40 years, and every year it
    makes hundreds more.

    To say that Coach House "publishes" books would diminish the magic of what
    really happens within the old brick walls of these interlinked buildings on
    bpNichol Lane, named for the late poet who is now its patron saint. It is a=
    n
    amazingly resilient little factory where some of the most famous writers in
    Canada first learned to read proofs and glue bindings. Paper and ink go in
    one door and art comes out another. In the middle is a fluctuating commune
    of editors, typesetters, printers and designers centred on Stan Bevington, =
    a
    bearded master printer and cultural genius, who has been there from the
    beginning.

    But the rumble of the presses on this plain but sacred ground is not likely
    to last long. Next week, survey crews are arriving to prepare for the
    redevelopment of the site and the likely destruction of the old garages. Mr=
    .
    Bevington's landlord, Campus Co-op Residences, wants to replace them with
    more student housing and appears determined to squeeze out the Coach House
    Press.

    Everybody is in a bind, according to Mr. Bevington, who has spent the past
    year negotiating for survival, without success. The co-op, which operates
    dozens of rundown rooming houses in the neighbourhood -- and which rented
    the Huron Street garages to Mr. Bevington for 38 years without a lease --
    needs to rejuvenate to survive. But Stan Bevington needs to stay exactly
    where he is.

    "A move is as bad as a fire," Mr. Bevington said in an interview this week,
    citing traditional wisdom of the printing trade. And even if he accepts the
    co-op's offer to lease him office space in the new building, he would never
    be able to work there. "They're very clear they don't want the presses in
    the new building."

    Coach House disappeared once before, its publishing arm bankrupted by an
    overambitious expansion into the mainstream a decade ago. But Mr. Bevington
    kept on making gorgeous books and catalogues for an eager market while
    gradually rebuilding the company's literary program. Under new editor Alana
    Wilcox, it once again produces an annual list of new poetry and avant-garde
    fiction.

    Ms. Wilcox savours the tang of printer's ink in the atmosphere of her
    workplace. "Financially, it's ideal for us to print in-house," she said.
    "But also culturally. Authors come to see their own books being made. We ge=
    t
    school tours, we get pilgrims from all over."

    "Michael Ondaatje brings around every foreign visitor who comes to this
    city," Mr. Bevington noted.

    "Just the list of people who've sat on that chair," the editor continued,
    drawing out the stories . . . The feet that have sculpted the deeply worn
    treads of the old wooden staircase, the memory of not-yet famous authors
    washing the covers of returned books in the upstairs sink, preparing them
    for resale, the smell of molten lead in the antique, still functional
    Linotype machine by the door.

    "This building has important cultural value," Ms. Wilcox said. "It's a kind
    of living museum, a place where people can learn about culture and
    bookmaking as it continues on."

    The landlord has offered a glass case for a few artifacts in the new
    building, but the book producers will have none of that. The integrity of
    the building is an important part of the cultural ideal that has kept the
    presses running for almost 40 years, according to Mr. Bevington. "We are
    aesthetic around here and we are committed to real things," he said. "We ar=
    e
    completely against veneer."

    Thus the "curious fight," as he calls it, "to maintain a silly old decaying
    building exactly as it is, a culture factory that anybody else in their
    right mind would have slapped aluminum siding on long ago."

    The fight went badly this week when bureaucrats in the city's department of
    heritage preservation services told the printer that his shop met none of
    the criteria required for historical designation -- even though Heritage
    Toronto, a semi-official advisory group, has already recommended that it be
    designated. The ramshackle complex's lack of gingerbread and window boxes
    appears to be fatal.

    So now, as he deals with escalating demands for renovations from a landlord
    determined to evict him, the printer is looking around for new saviours, hi=
    s
    "delightfully hands-off relationship" with Campus Co-op at an end.

    Mr. Bevington said he would buy the buildings if he could. In the meantime,
    he is preparing to close shop -- as quiet and competent as ever, but
    mystified by the attitude of cultural bureaucrats in City Hall. If somethin=
    g
    as rare, as remarkable and as culturally significant as the Coach House
    Press isn't worth saving -- or even trying to save -- what else could be?

If I Get Shot by the Police

    Maybe the tempest of blue-on-black homicide hasnt rained down on
    you. ... burying hope with one hand and exhuming a twisted justice
    with the other. As a black man, whatever that means, Id better give
    you my take on things. If I get shot by the police, youll never hear
    it like it happened. If I get shot by the police, you should know
    that I wasnt a drug dealer, an ex-felon, or an addict. Better still,
    you should know that it doesnt matter. In my life, I met countless
    men and women whod been in each of those places. All had many things

Maybe the tempest of blue-on-black homicide hasnt rained down on you.
But the police slayings of unarmed black men that continue to grip
America are a sinister eulogy; burying hope with one hand and exhuming a
twisted justice with the other. As a black man, whatever that means, Id
better give you my take on things. If I get shot by the police, youll
never hear it like it happened.

If I get shot by the police, you should know that I wasnt a drug dealer,
an ex-felon, or an addict. Better still, you should know that it doesnt
matter. In my life, I met countless men and women whod been in each of
those places. All had many things to teach me.

No matter what they say if I get shot by the police, I wasnt brandishing
a firearm. I wasnt being aggressive. I may have been listening to music
with a beat, but I wasnt a thug. I repeat: I wasnt a thug. Of course,
nobody can be reduced to a slur.

Who is a thug anyway? A boy-made-man
by violent urban divestment? A boy whose image-world became a temple of
saccharine Eurocentric consumerism? A boy who saw no intelligent visions
of himself? An exile whose neighborhood was run-down, torn-down,
rebuilt, and gentrified without him inside? Know that I tried to make a
difference in these issues. I tried to add my nuts and bolts to Lowells
scaffold of truth.

If I get shot by the police, it wont be called a Musician Shooting,a
Composer Shooting,or a Vocalist Shooting.The headlines wont say Orator
Shooting,Scholar Shooting,Pianist ShootingSuperb Cook Shooting,or
Loving Uncle Shooting.The headlines wont mention me at all. Theyll say
Police Shooting,as though it makes no difference whether I was a man or
a fire hydrant; as long as I got shot by a badge.

Your television set wont say an author was shot by the police this
evening.Only a man,a suspect,or a resident.I wont have an occupation,
because that evokes dignity and worth. Only the police will be named by
their occupation; to shoot defective humans like me. The newsreels will
make real this fantasy. Dont buy the spin if I get shot by the police.

I wont be gunned down,because gunning downaffirms the victim.
Shootingaffirms the perpetrator. Police officers get gunned down,but
others just get shot by them. Equal tragedy will get unequal rhetoric.
Beware of this if I get shot by the police.

publisher@ blackcommentator.com

There will be no context if I get shot by the police.

Ill be an anomaly. A trivia. A statistic. Time will
pass. Ill be uttered at someones kitchen table during a TV commercial:
Remember the guy they shot that year? No, the other one.Your local paper
wont situate me in the history of police brutality. It wont be delivered
with shrink-wrapped Cliffs Notes to the legacy of American ethnic
cleansing.

Every February, if I get shot by the police, I wont be acknowledged on
the intercom at your local grocery chain. I wont appear next to
sanitized, neutralized, and unrealized caricatures of Carver, Parks, and
King. I wont be in the fifteen-second-spots on your local network
affiliates that celebrate Black History. I wont be a topic as
politicians remind us just how far weve come. The media will close-up
the present as they trumpet closure of the past. You can bet on that if
I get shot by the police.

There will be no justice if I get shot by the police. My shooter will
get paid administrative leave. Theyll rush before a conduct committee;
union-approved with citizens removed. If they are exonerated, no charges
will be filed. If they are reprimanded, no charges will be filed. If
they are white, race wont be a factor. If they arent white, the question
will be profane. Colleagues will give interviews, and be glad to have
the officer back in action. Their family will be made a highlight of
the difficult ordeal.

I will be silent; beyond the chamber of fiction. A
never-was-didnt-happen casserole in the atrophied kitchen of critical
vision. A raindrop in the flooding genetic memory of some chocolate
infant, unreal and unacknowledged in the tribulations of his tomorrow.

There is a particular unpleasantness, when one is raising issues of
race, in having one's criticisms dismissed as "paranoia."  But I will
do Lucas Klein the favor of leaving that to one side.

If "Asian"--as opposed to Chinese or Taiwanese or Japanese--only
means something "in the diaspora," well, I can't help it if that's
where I live.  In fact, Lucas's dismissal is one I frequently hear
when I raise questions about Asians and Asian Americans in poetic
circles.  American poetry--and American liberal politics--has for
decades been marked by a certain romance with Asian culture, which
means that poets in this country are much more likely to have read
Asian literature, spent time or lived in an Asian country, and be
acquainted with Asian people than their non-poet peers.  In most
respects this is entirely laudable.  But in discussions such as
these, knowledge of Asia can be used as a club against Asian
Americans, who find their own positions being displaced by lectures
on the "true" meaning of Chinese or Japanese culture--cultures of
which they are viewed only as attenuated representatives.
(Apparently such knowledge can even be used against the Taiwanese
themselves: as Andrew's poem asks: "WHY CAN'T THE TAIWANESE / get
their Buddhism and Taoism straight".)

It is, of course, true that few people born and raised in the
People's Republic of China or Taiwan would primarily identify
themselves as "Asian."  It is also certainly true that there are many
people in North America who are perfectly capable of distinguishing
between Taiwan and the PRC and Japan and Korea.  But it also seems
clear to me that Andrew's poem has little interest in making those
kinds of distinctions--in wondering what is particular to the
politics and culture of Taiwan as opposed to that or, say, Korea or
even the Chinese mainland.  Andrew's individual observations seem
hardly to apply only to Taiwan--the "most cell phones per capita" is
also a figure I've heard used about Hong Kong--but when taken
together they do correspond to a broader image of Asian culture that
has been dominant in the U.S. since at least the mid-1980s:
technology- and science-obsessed but also somehow inhuman, sexist,
fawning over Western culture and still possessed of exotic/disgusting
eating habits.  This is an image that has nothing to do with what
individual Chinese persons think of themselves; it has to do with
American anxieties about what Asian nations represent, and about how
those anxieties get displaced onto racial thinking rather than fine
points of political economy.

I am not sure when "culture shock" became an acceptable cover for
racist thinking, but I do think that Rich Newman's posts are an
eloquent testimony to how it is possible to struggle conscientiously
with such cultural alienation, and in a way that leads to a
questioning of one's own position rather than a lashing out at the
other.  Rich has also done a fine job of suggesting how "culture
shock" and racism can be deeply intertwined, however open-minded we
struggle to be.  And there's a disturbing undercurrent to the
"culture shock" defense that I think is crucial not only to Andrew's
poem but to the poem's flamboyance: the idea that Andrew's poem gives
voice to what "we" all really think upon encountering an Asian
culture but are too cowed by political correctness to say.  But by
putting his poem in the form of what Lucas has rightly called a
"rant," and by homing in on precisely those elements most
constitutive of anti-Asian stereotypes, Andrew has provided us not an
"honest" reaction to Taiwan but one designed maximally to provoke
hostility and revulsion.

Lucas actually makes my point quite well for me.  He compares
Andrew's poem to the hypothetical ravings of a French person in the
U.S., who might say:

"Why do the Americans feed techno-capitalism to their young?  Why do
Americans hate the air?  Why are Americans so fat?  And why do I want
to study English and work in America and make a lot of money?"

The crucial turn here is the emergence in the final sentence of an
"I" that acknowledges and questions its own implication in the
cultural imperialism it purports to critique and loathe.  That "I" is
precisely what does *not* appear in the final lines of Andrew's poem:

"WHY DO THE TAIWANESE
        want to pay my student loans
WHILE I CORRUPT THEIR YOUTH
        without shaving"

The function of the "I" here is entirely opposed to that of the "I"
in Lucas's example.  The "I" here is one that, in fact, takes
pleasure in its own position of power, a power that seems
effortlessly and casually exercised.  If there is a critical turn
here, it is not directed at the "I," but at the Taiwanese, who are
such dupes that they shower generosity upon a person who lords it
over them and belittles their culture.  Lucas's hypothetical French
speaker critiques both the other *and* the self; Andrew's poem is a
one-way street.

Timothy, and everyone:

True, saying that you were being paranoid in reacting to Andrew's poem the
way you do is overstepping the line. I apologize.

Nor do I criticize you from being from the diaspora, for being Asian where
Asian means something. But while you are from North America and live in a
world where "Asian" is a racialized concept, Andrew's poem is--for better or
for worse--from Taiwan, where Taiwan, Asian, and American/Canadian/European
are not racialized. As Andrew mentioned, blackness is extremely racialized
in Taiwan, but just because Taiwanese women--as women in almost all parts of
Asia--buy skin-whitening products does not mean that whiteness comes with a
certain cultural value to be placed over the "yellowness" of Taiwanese
natives.

As has been made clear, when the poem "Why do the Tiawanese" moves from
Andrew in Taiwan to Timothy in North America, it's going through a large
transition from one complex and confused conglomeration of cultures to
another. That's good. The issue here is how to define its racism, or rather,
who (which conglomerate of cultures) gets the contextual upper-hand in
saying whether the poem's statements are racist. Andrew says it's not,
Timothy says it is. In Taiwan, even from the hand of a Candian, it is not;
in America, especially in the eyes of an Asian-American, it is.

I suppose a part of me wants to find a more objective way of qualifying
racism, and that is why I--a white American for the moment living in China,
as I have been on and off for ten years--reel against the ease with which
you, Timothy, can label the poem as racist. It reminds me of John Yau's
dismissal of Pound's Cathay as imperialist--Pound was many things, few of
which are today politically acceptable, but imperialist? because he was a
translator?--or of Juliana Chang, Walter K. Lew, Tan Lin, and others
reacting against the Yasusada poems because of some kind of "orientalism" in
the creation of that nuclear poet. I think the writing is worth more than a
dismissal as racist. How the poetry--Pound's, Yasusada, "Why do the
Tiawanese"--reacts and responds with the ideas and assumptions of racism,
that's a more interesting topic, to me. And hey, that's what we've got here,
actually. But to dismiss it, to criticize it, because of something read into
the poem rather than inherently part of it, well, that goes too far, too.

And this is why I'm intrigued and impressed by Rich's comments about how
culture shock and cultural stereotypes play into each other. It's something,
in all my experiences with other cultures, I never bothered to think about.
To be frank I don't _enjoy_ thinking about it, incriminating as it may be to
my whole time over here, but I do value the idea as something I'd better
think about. And how this plays out in Andrew's poem is, I think, the
question to be discussing, rather than simply whether it is or is not
racist.

As for lectures on the "true" meaning of Chinese culture being used to
cudgel against Asian Americans, that's all just crap and I'm sorry if what I
said put you in that direction. There is no "true" meaning of any
culture--hence these damned debates!--and while you as an Asian American may
be an attenuated representative, so are Lee Teng-hui, Coco Li Wen, and
Wai-lim Yip. The biggest problem we as North Americans have may be in seeing
that all cultures--races, continents, countries--are as complicated and
diverse as we are ourselves. We don't have a monopoly on this particular
problem, either, by the way.

And in terms of complexity or simplicity, Timothy, you and I read the end of
Andrew's poem differently. I'm honored you find my cultural translation more
complex than Andrew's original, but I don't read the end of his poem with as
blanket arrogance as you see in it. And if I did see it the same way, I'm
sure you & I might agree on many other points, too.

Some quotes from Lucas' most recent post, not necessarily in the order in
which he wrote them:

>>The issue here is how to define its racism, or rather, who (which
conglomerate of cultures) gets the contextual upper-hand in saying whether
the poem's statements are racist. Andrew says it's not, Timothy says it is.
In Taiwan, even from the hand of a Candian, it is not; in America,
especially in the eyes of an Asian-American, it is.<<

The problem here, for me, is with what seems to be the tacit assumption that
Andrew, or any of us, can somehow leave our own culture behind when we write
about an other, "alien" culture in which we are living. It may be that some
of the things Andrew had to say about Taiwan are factually true despite the
fact that they also play into US/Western stereotypes of Asian culture and so
those facts, in Taiwan, would not be racialized the way they are here in the
US/Canada, but that does not mean that Andrew does not carry around in
himself that racialization--as all of us cannot help but do, even those of
us who are racialized, simply because we grew up in a culture where
racialization takes place--and so it seems to be perfectly possible that the
poem could be racist in/from both places. It may not be racist in the same
way--it occurs to me now as I write this--but that does not mean it is not
racist.

So, what do I mean by implying that there is a distinction between how this
poem might be racist in the US/Canada and how it might be racist in Taiwan?
I'm thinking this out as I write, so it will probably be pretty sloppy at
some points, but let me try this: Let's assume, for the moment--and it is a
big assumption--that what I read as one of Lucas' assumptions is true, i.e.,
that the Taiwanese themselves would not read Andrew's poem as a racist
comment on who they are in the way that Timothy Liu and other
Asian-Americans would. This makes sense at first glance--and that's really
all I'm giving it for the moment in the service of making my larger
point--because the Taiwanese are not racialized in their own country as
Asian in the way that Asians are over here. To say, however, that a poem
like Andrew's is, therefore, not racist, however, suggests that racism is
entirely situational, reducible not to the values we carry around in our
heads and their relationship to the larger socio-economic, political and
cultural structures that create and perpetuate racism, globally and locally,
but rather to whether what one says about a particular group of people is or
is not true in context. This seems to be a particularly dangerous way to
define racism because it absolves people of responsibility for the ways in
which we are implicated in those larger structures. In other words, it does
not seem to me necessary for the Taiwanese to be insulted by Andrew's poem
for it to be racist; it can be racist simply because it expresses racism.

A couple of things occur to me now as I write this: Some years ago, in my
capacity as ESL Placement Coordinator at the college where I teach, I met
with two students, Black women, one from Trinidad (I think it was) and the
other from Haiti. They'd been sent to me by their Freshman English
instructor because he believed that errors they had made in their first-day
diagnostic essay should have disqualified them from taking a credit-bearing
composition class. (He also made a point of saying to me, when he told me
about them, that they were, you know, "Spanish speakers," and, you know,
"Spanish speakers" have an awfully hard time getting their verb tenses
right.) The woman from Trinidad did indeed need to be sent back to a
remedial/developmental level of English; the woman from Haiti had made a
single, egregious grammatical error in her paper and it was in the use of
the "present perfect infinitive." I'm not sure if I have the grammatical
terminology write, but the error was in a sentence where she was trying to
produce the construction "I was to have been...." Anyway, it was very clear
to both women, and to me, that they were dealing with racism on the part of
their instructor, and the part of this story that is relevant here is what
the Haitian woman said to me before she left my office. She commented that
while she knew what racism was intellectually and had been able when she was
in Haiti to point it out and critique it and so on, because in Haiti she had
been part of the majority culture, she now realized, she had never taken,
had never really had to take racism personally, the way she obviously had to
take it personally in the situation she was in.

Now, I know the instructor in question. He is a lovely man who would never
dream of consciously discriminating racially against students, and I have no
doubt he would have been profoundly disappointed in himself and apologetic
towards the students if he had been made to see what had happened in this
situation. (The students asked me not to pursue anything further with him
and so I did not.) And I have no doubt if this man had been teaching in
Haiti, he would have been a well-meaning instructor who would nonetheless
have brought his racism with him. The Haitians might very well have been
able to ignore or tolerate his racism because of their position of security
as the majority group/culture in their own country, but that would not mean
that the instructor I am talking about, the things he said and did, the ways
in which he talked to and about his students, would cease to be racist,
however subtly and unintentionally. I am of course not comparing Andrew
himself to this instructor, but rather the speaker/discourse/rhetoric of
Andrew's poem.

Another relevant example from where I teach: A Black student--either Haitian
or Nigerian, I confess I don't remember which--walked in The Writing Center
to sign up for tutoring. She was being helped by an African-American student
aid and was not happy with the way the student aid was doing his or her job.
(I have forgotten the student aid's gender; this happened a long time ago.)
Anyway, the two students began shouting at each other and the non-American
student called the African-American student a nigger. It became clear in
subsequent discussion with the non-American student that she had no idea
that nigger was a term that, in the US, applied to her as well--let me
rephrase that, not that she had no idea, but her sense was that if the word
were used in reference to her it would be a mislabeling and expression of
ignorance on the part of the person who used it. She knew she was not "that
kind" of a Black person. She did believe, however, that the term was
accurate when used to describe "American Blacks" (her phrase) because they
were indeed everything, as a group--though she was willing to admit there
might be individual exceptions--that the word nigger was meant to say about
them.

This is, of course, an enormously complex situation and I know I am leaving
aside a lot of issues about race and racism that the situation raises, but
the point I want to make is this: The non-American Black woman might have
been able to choose not to be insulted by the term nigger, but that would
not mean that a person who used to term in reference to her, in whatever
country, in whatever context, was not using a word loaded with racial
significance and bearing the weight of a racist history. And, in my opinion,
the person using the word, for whatever reason--even another Black woman
using the word the way it is used in some sectors of the African-American
community simply to refer to other Black people--should be willing to be
held accountable for that, again something that I find missing in the
speaker of Andrew's poem.

>>But while you [Timothy Liu] are from North America and live in a
world where "Asian" is a racialized concept, Andrew's poem is--for better or
for worse--from Taiwan, where Taiwan, Asian, and American/Canadian/European
are not racialized. <<

Based on my experience in Korea, this does not sound right to me. There is a
highly developed consciousness of race there, most prominently visible in
the taboo against interracial marriages and the socio-cultural, if not
legal, second-class status of mixed-race children. It may be true that this
racial consciousness is not now accompanied by the degree of
institutionalized oppression and discrimination that we associate with the
term racism in the States, but that could also be a result of the fact that
there is not (not yet) a sizable enough Western immigrant population for
Koreans to feel threatened, the way, say, the size of the Asian or Latino
immigrant populations threaten dominant "white America." Also--and I will
phrase this as a question, because it is something I think I know, but I'm
not sure about--wasn't there a time when, in China and Japan particularly,
there were in fact some very strong discriminatory practices against white
people as white people, and not only because they represented imperial or
colonial governments? (I realize that the Chinese and Japanese might not
have used the term "white" the way we do, but I think my question makes
sense whatever term they used.)


>>I suppose a part of me wants to find a more objective way of qualifying
racism, and that is why I--a white American for the moment living in China,
as I have been on and off for ten years--reel against the ease with which
you, Timothy, can label the poem as racist.... How the poetry....reacts and
responds with the ideas and assumptions of racism, that's a more interesting
topic, to me.<<

These two things--calling the poem racist and discussing how the poetry
"reacts and responds with the ideas and assumptions of racism"--do not seem
to me mutually exclusive. Nor do I think that calling Andrew's poem racist
is necessarily to dismiss it out of hand. T. S. Eliot was an anti-Semite;
some of his poems are quite clearly anti-Semitic. To acknowledge that is not
to dismiss them, but rather to highlight something about them that is worth
discussing. The same is true, I think, of Andrew's poem. I think it is
racist, on its face--and it's interesting that while I also have called the
poem racist, most people who are responding against, or are at least
questioning that characterization of the poem, have been responding by name,
at least, to Timothy only--but I also think, especially given what Andrew
had to say about the poem after he posted it, that it was a failed attempt
to deal with a very difficult and complex issue (culture
shock/alienation/whatever), and it is worth discussing the racism inherent
in the failure and the issue as racism because to do otherwise is both to
obscure on some level the very issue Andrew was trying to deal with and to
do a disservice to him by failing to recognize--in retrospect, given his
later commentary, and given that I know nothing else about him that would
make what I am about to say inaccurate--what I think was the courage it took
for him to be as honest as he was about his feelings. And I say that at the
same time that I am deeply critical of his poem and its failures and despite
the fact that I don't agree with much of the analysis he laid out for us in
his posts explaining the poem, its context and his intentions.

Thanks for both Timothy and Richard's responses. Tim, I don't anything
anybody even semi-smart would suggest "culture shock" is any kind of defence
for what's said when somebody's gone 'off the hook' in what seems/is a
racist and/or zenophobic sounding purge.
In the interest of progress, I also don't think it's in anybody's interest
to paint Andrew into a permanent quarter. I would compliment him on this
situation and others of which I have occasionally read for at least being
open to a whole wide range of materials that bear down on his presence.
Which I think is a great value and the attraction of working in communities
that are impacted by diverse cultural, economic, geographic etc. edges.
Navigating - and writing or making art from - these new 'global spaces' is,
I think, the central challenge to the time - especially when weighed against
all the various ethnocentric, religious, nationalist, empire-ist etc.
alternatives currently gunning about the globe.
(And much more interesting than say biding youth and a PhD/MFA getting work
in an class insular, very upscale academic environment  - I suspect.)

As I might have suggested before, Andrew, in his immersion, will either keep
swimming through this and come up with something fresh and valuable (and
free from what's been pointed out) or, advisedly get off the set.  At least
I'd wish the same redemptive option if I had wandered up - what I sense is,
even with insistences to the contrary  - Andrew's contemporary version of
Kurtzian Conrad's Congo "up the river" state of mind.

(Parenthetically, I talk about some of this in  Sentinel magazine's
interview with me about my teaching and writing experiences at the
University of Nigera, Nssuka - which, for those interested, remains online
at:

http://www.sentinelpoetry.org.uk/magazine0703/with_stephen_vincent.html)

Thanks,

Stephen V

Life After Capitalism Conference
2004 NYC August 20-22nd
http://www.lifeaftercapitalism.org

-- register now !--

The protests around the Republican National Convention taking place in
York City later this summer are shaping up to be perhaps the &gt;largest
this country has ever seen.  As folks from all over the &gt;United States
have started booking their flights, organizing their &gt;local communities
into busses and vans, and collecting that last bit &gt;of gas money from
in between the pillows of their couches -
&gt;organizers are quietly discussing the possibility of having over 1
&gt;million people converging in the streets of New York City during the
&gt;week of Aug 28th-September 2nd....
&gt;
&gt;While these protests will give us the chance to collectively raise
&gt;our voices in opposition to the direction that this government is
&gt;taking us - many of us realize that the problems that we face run
&gt;much deeper then simply the Bush administration, the Democrats, or
&gt;this upcoming current election cycle. What we face are institutional
&gt;problems, problems which will only be challenged and ultimately
&gt;overcome by imaginative and broad based social movements - not
&gt;ballot boxes. Life After Capitalism 2004 aims at contributing to
&gt;this process by providing a space for activists- in the run up to
&gt;the intense mobilization period - to reflect on the importance of
&gt;long term vision, strategy, and face to face relationship building.
&gt;
&gt;This is an invitation, asking activists from around the country to
&gt;come into New York City a week prior to the major demonstrations and
&gt;participate in what should be an exciting and energizing weekend - a
&gt;weekend that seeks to bring together and give voice to the
&gt;(non-sectarian) anti-capitalist left in the United States. Below you
&gt;will find a list of both speakers as well as topics of discussion
&gt;which should hopefully give you an idea of what this conference is
&gt;trying to accomplish.
&gt;
&gt;Check out the website (www.lifeaftercapitalism.org) - which will be
&gt;completely re-designed by mid July, complete with full schedule,
&gt;links to related sites and resources, cheap places to stay in New
&gt;York City etc.
&gt;
&gt;The site briefly outlines the basic areas of focus within the
&gt;conference but more importantly allows you to register online,
&gt;something we encourage folks to do as soon as possible due to space
&gt;restrictions of approx. 700 participants. We have worked very hard
&gt;to keep all costs to a minimum ($15-25 sliding scale) - all
&gt;registration fees go directly into making this weekend happen as our
&gt;only funding comes through the opening Friday evening event and
&gt;conference fees. We also have a number of scholarships available for
&gt;people who are interested in attending. These scholarships will be
&gt;extended specifically to activist communities who have been
&gt;traditionally marginalized from these kinds of gatherings and
&gt;debates. For any and all questions/suggestions please contact: &gt;
&gt;info@lifeaftercapitalism.org or call (212) 591-0083
&gt;

Rich, Stephen, Timothy, Andrew, and everyone:

One of the reasons I'm enjoying this thread is that everyone contributing is
convincingly intelligent. I'm having a hard time figuring out what I really
believe. Particularly when Rich's and Stephen's comments turn to experiences
in Africa or with Africans and Caribbeans, and the interface with Asian
culture or Asian-American life, well, it gets complex, don't it?

So as for rebuttals, I only have minor tweaks with which to respond to
Rich's last post. He wrote, in response to my saying that westerners are not
racialized in Taiwan the way that Asians and other races are racialized in
North America:

> Based on my experience in Korea, this does not sound right to me. There is
a
highly developed consciousness of race there, most prominently visible in
the taboo against interracial marriages and the socio-cultural, if not
legal, second-class status of mixed-race children. . . . Also--and I will
phrase this as a question, because it is something I think I know, but I'm
not sure about--wasn't there a time when, in China and Japan particularly,
there were in fact some very strong discriminatory practices against white
people as white people, and not only because they represented imperial or
colonial governments?

I've never heard of such discrimination in China or Japan against white
people because they're white. It's possible, but I know nothing about it. In
mainland China--and this works differently in Taiwan and Hong Kong, to say
nothing of Korea or Japan or East Asian countries, mostly due to
economics--the emphasis is on foreignness. While foreigners used to be
imperialists, now we're almost viewed as capitalist knights bringing money
to the country. This doesn't sit so well with some of us when we're assumed
to be rich and profligate, but it means that what's more important is our
country than our ethnicity. For a Chinese student to go to America is the
highest honor, after that probably Canada, because they believe that they
can get to America easily because of proximity, then England, then
Australia, then New Zealand. Ireland and South Africa, let alone Jamaica,
don't even make it on the radar. After these English-speaking countries are
Western European countries such as France and Germany, with the other EU
members somewhere behind, and on and on. And the amount of admiration given
to people from these countries pretty much fits with how well a student
would like to study in these countries. The situation isn't racial, but
rather economic--albeit presenting a somewhat skewed economic view when
Canada trumps Germany, and so on--and has everything to do with proximity to
money instead of proximity to whiteness (for black people it's very
different: I met a dormitory housecleaner who didn't like cleaning the room
of a black girl at the school because she was afraid it might rub off. She
even asked me how the girl knew when she was dirty or clean. But an American
black friend of mine was talking to an African black friend of his about
being black in China, and she didn't want to hear it: "as black as you are,"
she said, "you're still American." She meant that Chinese people would
always respect him more than an African).

And while there is, among conservatives, some kind of a lingering taboo
against inter-racial relationships, most of that is because of a prejudice
that Western men are loose and care only about sex instead of building a
family. When it gets down to marriage, few families would object (especially
because the grandchildren could have access to all that western money). And
as for those mixed-race children, almost everyone I know from China and
Taiwan has said the same thing: they're beautiful, they're smart (an
interesting aside: almost the only Jew anyone in China has heard of is
Einstein: so in China, Jews are smart). I would hazard a guess that the US
military presence in Korea has made treatment of mixed-race children very
different from other parts of Asia.

Furthermore, just to punctuate the discussion on racism in Asia a little bit
more, China has no history of racist violence. While calling someone
"nigger" in America conjures up images of black people hanging from trees,
it doesn't happen like that in China. The 56 ethnic minorities in China may
bring with them any number of stereotypes, and Chinese people don't view
this with anywhere near the amount of attention we in the west do. I heard a
woman--a minority from Yunnan province in the south, getting an MA in
Ethnography from National Minority University in Beijing--say about the
Uighurs (Turkish Muslims from Xinjiang province in the northwest) that
"among ten Uighurs, nine are thieves". When I said I thought her comment was
racist, she said it wasn't racist, it was a figure of speech. And I couldn't
get much more out of her than that.

Also from Rich's post:

> > These two things--calling the poem racist and discussing how the poetry
> > "reacts and responds with the ideas and assumptions of racism"--do not
seem
> > to me mutually exclusive. Nor do I think that calling Andrew's poem
racist
> > is necessarily to dismiss it out of hand. T. S. Eliot was an
anti-Semite;
> > some of his poems are quite clearly anti-Semitic. To acknowledge that is
not
> > to dismiss them, but rather to highlight something about them that is
worth
> > discussing. The same is true, I think, of Andrew's poem.

This is a good point. But it's not exactly what I meant. I don't know how to
explain this other than by an anecdote. A few years ago on Martin Luther
King day I needed to do some laundry. I joked to a friend of mine, "I think
the laundromat will be open today, because they still separate whites from
colors". He laughed, but also said it was racist. I don't think it was
racist. I think it was a joke that played on racism. To look at how
racism/anti-semitism functions in T. S. Eliot's plays (or in our
appreciation of Othello or Merchant of Venice, two other prominent examples)
is still, in some ways, to criticise their racism. But I guess I'm still
reading more irony in Andrew's poem than others--Rich and Timothy (Yu, not
Liu, by the way: Timothy Liu is another Chinese-American poet)--are willing
to give it. So when I come across lines like

WHY DO THE TIAWANESE
           men all have to be engineers

or

WHAT DO THE TIAWANESE
           have against the Humanities

I don't see them as racist statements, per se, but rather as statements
interacting with the stereotypes of Taiwanese/Asians in the world. Of course
this is a debatable point. But what isn't debatable is that this poem
contains a lot of sympathy for the Taiwanese, as well. And this has gone
unnoticed in our discussions:

> WHY DO THE TAIWANESE
>           pay me so well

> WHY DO THE TIAWANESE
>           adore Bon Jovi
> WHY DO THE TAIWANESE
>           hate Koreans

> HOW DO THE TAIWANESE
>           stay so thin on a of diet fried meat and white rice
> WHY DO THE TIAWANESE
>           despise homosexuals

> WHY DO THE TIAWANESE
>           hate independent women

> WHY AREN'T THE TAIWANESE
>           allowed to hold democratic referendums and be
> independent of
>    the Commies
> WHY CAN'T THE TIAWANESE
>    find the Denmark on map
> WHY DO THE TIAWANESE
>           build bomb shelters instead of homes

> WHY DO THE TIAWANESE
>           have such corrupt policemen
> WHY DO THE TAIWANESE
>           love simulacra
> WHY DO THE TIAWANESE
>           put the grandchildren on a scooter

> WHY ARE THE TIAWANESE
>           the friendliest people ever

You may say that the object of attack--if that's what it is--is still the
all-caps TAIWANESE (or TIAWANESE), but the sympathy in these lines is almost
always for the people of Taiwan who somehow go unrepresented in that
all-caps phrase. The sympathy is for the Koreans, the homosexuals, the
independnt women, the under-educated, the victims of corruption, the
grandchildren on scooters, the friendliest people ever, who are not allowed,
like the Taiwanese unable to hold democratic referendums and be independent
of the Commies, to fulfill their own destinies, held down as they are by the
larger forces of society.

And finally, from Stephen's interview:

Arriving and living in Nsukka put me into a wonderful state of shock. At
once it was humbling. I quickly realized that there was no way I was going
to write authoritatively about the African experience. I was from a country
about 200 years old and suddenly in a world with languages and traditions
that went back hundreds, if not thousands of years.

This is a very touching point, and I think one of the real problems with
Andrew's poem, and my own posts, is that we have not built--or else have
lost--that humility keeping us from writing authoritatively about the Asian
experience.

Lucas,

I appreciate your withdrawing from the charge of paranoia.

I think you may have me confused with someone who seeks to use the
charge of "racism" to shut down a discussion or to dismiss a piece of
writing out of hand.  I hope my many lengthy posts over the past few
days have demonstrated, at the least, that I do not raise the issue
of racism with the "ease" you suggest; my arguments may be strongly
worded, but they are arguments, based on my reading of a piece of
writing, and not simply name-calling.

To reduce my objections to the question of whether Andrew's poem is
or isn't racist is really to misunderstand what racism is.  Take, for
example, your dismay at the claim that Pound's _Cathay_ is
"imperialist."  Pound was writing at the beginning of the 20th
century as an Anglo-American author at a moment when the British
Empire was very much alive in Asia, when the United States was
beginning its ascendance as a world power through actions such as its
colonization of the Philippines, and when a weakened China found
itself largely under the economic and military sway of Western
powers.  If "imperialism" means anything at all, then *of course*
_Cathay_ is an imperialist text, in the sense that it emerges from
this relation of cultural power.  Such a statement is in no way
incompatible with the belief (which I share) that _Cathay_ is an
indisputably great work of poetry in English, or with Pound's own
sense of respect for and sensitivity to Chinese culture.  Edward
Said, after all, discovers "Orientalism" not in the most lowly and
bigoted works of the West, but in its most brilliant and meticulous
scholarship and in the works of writers like Flaubert.  Hugh Kenner
had it right when he credited Pound with the "invention" of China:
Pound's _Cathay_ *created* the China that he, and the West, needed at
a particular historical moment; and that creation is by definition a
product of a West whose relation to Asia is, at that moment,
imperialist.  Pound's poetry carries with it an entire set of beliefs
about Chinese politics, culture, and sensibility, which are
significant less for their correspondence to whatever "actual"
Chinese culture might be than for their function in the Euro-American
poetic discourse in which Pound himself participated.

Now to say these things is not to dismiss Pound's writing or to label
it as irredeemably racist or anything of that sort; in fact, it may
force us to enter into an even more complex relationship with Pound's
work, one that acknowledges our own implication in it as readers.
Perhaps I'm not familiar with the remarks by John Yau on Pound to
which you refer; but I do know that on at least one occasion Yau has
said his only access to a "Chinese" culture or heritage in his
artistic development was, in fact, Pound's _Cathay_.  By doing so,
Yau signals his discomfort with the idea that a Chinese American
writer ought to have some kind of natural link with Chinese culture;
but he also acknowledges that he, as an American writer, has nowhere
else to go for an image of China than Pound, however mediated that
image may be--saying (this is from a 1990 interview in _Talisman_)
"For me, they were about being Chinese, about some kind of identity;
they were something I could get ahold of, or at least had the
illusion I could get ahold of."  To acknowledge that Pound's work is
mediated by and marked by imperialism--by the need to "invent" the
China that Pound needed--is not a dismissal, but simply an awareness
of historical context and of our own illusions.

Again, I think Rich has done a bold and excellent job of laying out
some of these issues too, arguing that racism is less a question of
situational intent than a question of how an utterance fits into a
larger discourse, and suggesting that racism is an unavoidable
element of cross-cultural content--to think otherwise, as Rich
suggests, is to engage in the illusion that one can simply step
outside one's own culture.

(Rich also raises the interesting point that most of the responses
and defenses of the poem have been addressed directly to me, even
though he has, if anything, been more forceful in labeling Andrew's
poem as racist.  I have certainly encouraged this by responding to
individual posters.  But it is true that while some have suggested
that my responses to Andrew's poem are extreme and dismissive, Rich's
arguably more radical positions against the poem have been
extensively praised by some of those same people.  Why this is I
can't exactly say--perhaps Rich is just doing a better job than I
am--but I suppose one uncharitable reading would come from Lucas's
linking of my arguments to those of John Yau, Walter Lew, Juliana
Chang, and Tan Lin [company I'm proud to be in]--all other Asian
American writers whose arguments Lucas also rejects as simplistic.  I
suppose the implication is that a charge of racism by an Asian
American is understood to be racially motivated and hence
one-dimensional, while Rich's similar arguments can safely be
regarded as balanced and nuanced.  I say this not in any way as a
criticism of Rich, but as a way of trying to answer a question he
raised.)

Lucas, I must also take issue with your claim that my objections are
based by my "reading into" Andrew's poem something that isn't
"inherently part of it."  If you have, as you say, read your Barthes
and Fish, you ought to know that there can be no bright line drawn
between what is "read into" and what is "just there."  I think this
division is a product of the misguided idea that political and racial
issues are somehow "outside" the text--distractions from what the
text is really saying.  But of course the whole point here is that
Andrew has very consciously and aggressively brought such issues
*into* his text.  You claim that Andrew says his poem is not racist,
but that is a little too clear-cut; he in fact acknowledges that his
poem's "intractable ugliness" *could* be read as racism, but that it
wouldn't be by someone in Andrew's position--that of a North American
who has lived in Asia.  (Well, given your and Rich's reactions--and
that I am also a North American who has lived in Asia--I'd say the
evidence is about two-thirds against.)  I would argue that Andrew in
fact *uses* this perception of racism--that his poem would have no
power if it did not lean on the charge that its potentially racist
observations have.

In what sense is Andrew's poem "from Taiwan"?  It may be physically
written there, but I hardly see how it emerges from or participates
in some kind of "Taiwanese" discourse that is so radically different
from a North American one that its utterances could not be regarded
as racist.  It's written in English in the voice of a Western
visitor, using all of these assumptions that such a visitor would
have, and it clearly seems addressed to an audience that is also
observing the Taiwanese and not one of them.  Rich has already done a
fine job of demolishing the idea that the poem is "not racist" in
Taiwan, but I would go so far as to say that question is irrelevant:
the poem is not playing in Taiwan at all.

Finally, perhaps I was too subtle in remarking, ironically, that
Asian Americans are seen merely as attenuated representatives of
Asian culture; what I meant to say was that to see them as *any* kind
of representatives of Asian culture is misguided.  We would not
regard a white American of German or Irish descent as an attenuated
representative of Germany or Ireland; yet people of Asian descent in
the U.S. are seen as somehow elementally tied to their ancestral
cultures.  Hence we lose on both counts: attenuated Asians, not-quite
Americans.  This is why, frankly, many Asian Americans are so
vigilant in critiquing perceptions of Asians by Americans; we know
that these perceptions affect us very directly.

not a very good poem tho it states some truths but what is that absurdity
of praying for america 's demise we're in alot of deep shit for sure
always have been since the damn whitey's wiped out the human beings but
hey where do you live and what do ya mean by demise sucker? dem  eyes
...where ya gonna go or are ya already there? you mean, i hope , if it's
at all possible that you pray for change in a positive way the hopefully
eventual demise of the negative prts of a system that has many good
attributes the transition from an oligarchy to a true democracy  ah what
the hell i could go on and on the fireworks were fine tho they represent
nothing your fireworks too represent nothing are you advocating overthrow
or just blow the whole damn place up and we'll all go live in france or
africa or israel of irag  or what and the rest of you smarty pants'
enought w/the andrew/tiawanese bullshit already on and on for what to get
to the root of what? you don't have to be there to know there it's all
here in the rotten apple everything you want except the consumption of
dogs cats and horses tho i'm sure even that's being done in some secret
corner and there's certainly plenty of folk that eat cat food and dog
food  even if we know WE really can't fix it we can all do our part by
throwing the trash in the trash can and recycling and giving a bit of
reality to each other instead of all this MEEEEEEEMEEEEEEMMMMMEEEE
me included of course  ......     stop feeding andrew he loves it stop
inciting negativity about the place that gives you heat in winter  and
remember i know too how f"d up this country is but here's where my little
shoe is so here's where i is for the present...

Timothy:

I don't have the full texts of the articles where either Yau calls Pound's
_Cathay_ an act of imperialism or where Chang and Lew and co. go off on
Yasusada's implicit racism. I do, fortunately, have citations and brief
quotations where I brought each one to bear in a paper on Rexroth's Love
Poems of Marichiko, but it doesn't reveal all that much.


John Yau, "Neither Us Nor Them", American Poetry Review; Mar/Apr, Vol. 23,
Issue 2, 1994:

"Pound's aesthetics are based on the idea that anything and anyone can be
appropriated, and, in this regard, he is very much a man of his times. For
at the beginning of the twentieth century, imperialism and colonialism were
still going strong."


Juliana Chang, Walter K. Lew, Tan Lin, Eileen Tabios, and John Yau,
"Displacements," Boston Review, Summer 1997,
http://www.bostonreview.net/BR22.3/Chang.html:

"act of yellowface at once plays into an existing and apparently vigorous
orientalist fantasy"


But if this is all that Yau wrote about _Cathay_, I wouldn't find it
anywhere near as odorous or onerous as I do. Essentially, Yau states
somewhere in his article, that Pound viewed China as a bunch of losers, and
all of his writings about China and the Chinese demonstrated this attitude.
It's an out-of-nowhere damnation of one of Pound's best books, and in my
mind not only is "imperialism" irrelevant, it's also misplaced: if not for
Pound's "invention" of China (the phrase is from T. S. Eliot before Hugh
Kenner, by the way, but it's still true), how would we have gotten to Yau's
own poem "A Suite of Imitations Written After Reading Translations of Poems
by Li He and Li Shang-yin", let alone to paintings based on Chinese
calligraphy by Brice Marden or Franz Kline, both of whom Yau has lauded in
critical writing?

Certainly anyone is able to change his mind, and this seems to be what Yau
has done in moving from claiming, in 1990, that Pound's versions were his in
to Chinese culture, to his '94 write-off of the book because it portrays
Chinese people in what he imagines to be a negative light. And just to be
clear, I think that at least in the article I read, Yau does, as you say,
"use the charge of 'racism' to shut down a discussion or to dismiss a piece
of writing out of hand", and is "incompatible with the belief (which I
share) that _Cathay_ is an indisputably great work of poetry in English, or
with Pound's own sense of respect for and sensitivity to Chinese culture."

You're right, though, that just because his name is Yau shouldn't make him
more likely to be a representative of Chinese culture (though it might mean
he should play basketball: if I remember correctly, his family is from
Shanghai--maybe he's related to Yao Ming). He doesn't have to prove himself
another Arthur Sze, who publishes Chinese translations. But if he wants to
step away from Chinese culture, perhaps he's betraying himself in his
authoritative tone of condemnation towards Pound's translations or--in the
review from which I'm quoting--the morals of the editor of the anthology in
question.

Which is not to say that you, Timothy, are putting this suit on for
yourself. And hell, maybe we're putting it on for you. After all, this is
the idea behind us saying "Timothy charges Andrew's poem with racism" rather
than "Timothy and Rich charge Andrew's poem with racism". Usually--though
obviously not always--those most sensitive to racism are those in position
to feel it directly. Where this puts the illusion that you can step outside
of your own culture, I'm not sure. At any rate, I won't buy that it
necessarily means Rich's comments are balanced while yours (Timothy's) are
one-dimensional, which is obviously not true. Really, I've rarely had such a
nuanced discussion leading from the simple question of whether someone is or
isn't, or should or shouldn't be, offended by a piece of writing.

Still, the complexity of racial identity is one-upped only by the complexity
of where this poem comes from. You're right that it's not "from Taiwan" the
way that Bai Xianyong's Taibei ren (kind of Taiwan's version of Joyce's
"Dubliners") is, or Hou Xiaoxian's film Millenium Mambo, or even Alvin Lu's
"The Hell Screens" (written in English by an LA writer), but it is from
Taiwan in the sense that the "Taiwanese" in the poem are not defined--as I
read it--racially but rather culturally.

Or maybe it's just as simple as I don't think it's racist to refer to
Taiwanese as dog-eating when a lot of Taiwanese people eat dogs (and so do
mainlanders and Koreans and I think Japanese). As long as somewhere along
the line we're able to acknowledge that Taiwanese are not _only_ dog-eaters,
and that eating dog meat is something we as North Americans can choose to
accept or reject, then what's wrong with saying out-loud that Taiwanese
people eat dog meat?

I suppose there is a difference between saying someone eats dog meat and
saying that someone is a dog-eater. But if identification with a specific
action is the problem, then look at the verbs in Andrew's poem: the
questions are almost all "why DO the Taiwanese", instead of "why ARE the
Taiwanese". And if treatment of dogs--in the poem, running over them, rather
than eating them--is the bone of contention (no pun intended), then why
should we be so bothered with a question that asks "why do" instead of
asserts that they all are?

Hi everyone, I'm updating the SpiralBridge Links page and it dawned on me
like a bowl of cold raviolis, many people/groups out here are amazing
contributors to the growing arts community and have great
poetry/music/art/community web sites that don’t have a SpiralBridge.org link
on it nor do we have a link up for many of your sites on our links page @
http://www.spiralbridge.org/links.asp

Please take a look, is your site listed?

Want it to swap links?

Send your link requests to Submissions@SpiralBridge.org

All of this info. is on the bottom of the Links page along with a small
savable image made by William Mallory, his link is there in the Music
section, for those of us who prefer clickable image links.

Also just a quick reminder, check out the calendar of NJ/NYC metro area
community poetry events @ http://www.spiralbridge.org/events.asp & please
feel free to add your Northern NJ/NYC Metro area poetry listing to the
calendar, we want to know what’s going on as we all need to support our
burgeoning arts community. Quick note for adding events, please put the
title separate from the body on the entry listing and choose a color for the
background, it looks hot if you hook it up!

Enjoy the heat and have a great summer!!!

Stay tuned and smile…
 -Jesse

Hi Steve:  To be at once totally self-serving and self-effacing at the same
time, poems from Sleeping With Sappho, my translations of some of Ann
Carson's translations from her Sappho volume (If Not, Winter) have just gone
up at Del Ray Cross' not quite formally announced preview issue of Shampoo
21:
http://www.shampoopoetry.com/ShampooTwentyone/vincent.html

A bouncy ride with eros, I think I can assure. May they arrive in Cambridge
as arrows on the Square! Time to stop!

Best wishes for your project.

that this nightmare called America
certainly must die.
...
my first memory of the flag
in its orgy
was Panama 1989 (On Fort Kobe there were more flags than bibles,
or sutras or any book of thought)

US children
were given the cartoon of "Pineapple Face" Noriega
& were instructed to laugh

now I want to cry
at the play I found in the middle of death

& never again will I mistake a fire on the horizon
for anything but pain

it has been imprinted on my thinking
now when I see smoke

on the nightly news
I remember to count the dead on my prayer beads.
...
Before I could remember, I was a target

the brakes on the train cut

that no man's land that ran through the heart of Soviet Germany

& the disco bombing echoed throughout my neighborhood

& all of this reached an eerie parallel

when I stepped into the South End of Albany

poet friend Victorio Reyes calls it Low Intensity Warfare

as if that were ever possible.
...
You want America

go ahead

keep it

I want a soul lifted in a prayer of resistance

to this last stage of Babylon.

Love Poetry:  Reading and Writing Practice

Flowers and chocolate are fine, but not extraordinary like love poetry.
A love poem can usefully and passionately express feeling and
experience, making it new.  During this workshop we will read and
discuss love poetry from many times and places as well as write and
critique our own poetry addressing a beloved, the complex of emotions
called love, and topics like marriage and parenthood.  By reading, we
will discover writing strategies and applications, including ideas for
discussion such as poetry as a gift exchange, as communication, and as
self-expression.  By writing love poetry and workshopping our poems, we
solve many of the subject matter and audience problems poetry presents.
By the end of the course, you will have written some love poetry, be
able to write more love poetry as the occasions arise, and be practiced
at selecting and discussing love poetry.

Overview: "Sonnet 43"

Elizabeth Barrett Browning

"Sonnet 43," the penultimate sonnet in Elizabeth Barrett Browning's
Sonnets from the Portugese, is perhaps the most famous of sonnets.

Barrett Browning originally printed Sonnets from the Portuguese as
pieces she had found and translated. They were, however, her own
compositions. The couple initially chose the deceptive title for
publication because they perceived the poems as so forcefully revealing
private emotions. They also had reason to worry that the drama of their
courtship would overshadow the sonnets themselves.  Once the
autobiographical content of the sonnets became known, the author's life
did become the most common tool for reading the cycle. While each of the
44 sonnets in the collection maintains a certain autonomy, it is also
possible to regard each as part of an intertwined narrative depicting
the various phases of a surrender to love. Read autobiographically, the
cycle begins tentatively with the speaker's amazement and distrust that,
in her sickly middle age, romantic love would appear. When she becomes
convinced of the man's love, she worries that, though sincere, it may be
only temporary. The cycle's movement suggests a good deal of hesitation
- one step back for every two steps forward - as the speaker addresses
her uncertainty. Can romantic love fill the void of familial community?
Can the suitor make good on his promise to fulfill her needs? There is,
nonetheless, an emotional progression, and in the final sonnets the
narrator transcends her questions and warnings to her lover. Throughout
the cycle, Barrett Browning describes romantic love in language that
echoes the passion of religious conversion; "Sonnet 43" uses a
particularly rapturous language to describe the love she feels for her
lover. After the opening line, the poem details seven ways she loves him
and closes with a request for love continued after death.

"Sonnet 43" exemplifies the poet's use of religious allusions throughout
Sonnets from the Portuguese. John S. Phillipson, writing in the
Victorian Newsletter in 1962, notes the echo of St. Paul, Ephesians III
17-19, where Paul prays that "Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith;
that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend
with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might
be filled with all the fulness of God." Philipson suggests that "Sonnet
43" adapts St. Paul's thought into a new context, explaining that the
"tone mingles suggestions of divine love with profane, implying a
transformation of the latter by or into the former and an ultimate
fusion of the two after death." While other critics have not
investigated the religious imagery in such detail, they generally
acknowledge the importance of reverent language in the poem. In her book
Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Virginia Radley states that "Students often
find Elizabeth confusing on the subject of God, Love, and Robert
Browning. For her, however, no confusion exists: God is Love; and Robert
Browning's love brought concrete form to the concept: in a Platonic
sense, it gave form to the formless." She concludes that, in Barrett
Browning's understanding, the "flame of love is divine in origin; it
burns through lovers; its fire distills all lesser metal out; what
remains is the pure essence."

Barrett Browning composed "Sonnet 43" in the form of a Petrarchan
Sonnet. A sonnet is a fourteen line poem in iambic pentameter, the most
common types of which are the Petrarchan sonnet and the Shakespearean
sonnet. The Petrarchan sonnet consists of two quatrains - sections of
four lines - that are usually recognized as forming an octave - an eight
line section. The octave is followed by a sestet, or a six line section.
The Petrarchan sonnet has a rigid abbaabba rhyme scheme in the octave.
The rhyme scheme in the sestet is variable, most commonly cdcdcd but
occasionally cdecde or cdcdee. Both types of sonnets present and solve a
problem; in the Petrarchan sonnet, the problem or issue is set up in the
octave and solved in the sestet. A "turn" - a marked shift in subject or
emotion reflected by a change in form - occurs at the ninth line,
between the octave and sestet. In anticipation of this, the second
quatrain (the second half of the octave) advances the subject matter in
some way, rather than merely repeating it in a different form.

Oh thou, beloved of my twenty-seven senses, I love thine! Thou thee thee
thine, I thine, thou mine, we?
That (by the way) is beside the point!
Who art thou, uncounted woman, Thou art, art thou?
People say, thou werst,
Let them say, they don't know what they are talking about.
Thou wearest thine hat on thy feet, and wanderest on thine hands,
On thine hands thou wanderest
Hallo, thy red dress, sawn into white folds,
Red I love Eve Blossom, red I love thine,
Thou thee thee thine, I thine, thou mine, we?
That (by the way) belongs to the cold glow!
Eve Blossom, red Eve Blossom what do people say?
prize question:

Eve Blossom is red,
Eve Blossom has wheels
what colour are the wheels?

Blue is the colour of your yellow hair
Red is the whirl of your green wheels,
Thou simple maiden in everyday dress,
Thou small green animal,
I love thine!
Thou thee thee thine, I thine, thou mine, we?
That (by the way) belongs to the glowing brazier!
Eve Blossom,eve,
E - V - E,
E easy, V victory, E easy,
I trickle your name.
Your name drops like soft tallow.
Do you know it, Eve?
Do you already know it?
One can also read you from the back
And you, you most glorious of all,
You are from the back as from the front,
E-V-E.
Easy victory.
Tallow trickles to stroke over my back
Eve Blossom,
Thou drippy animal,
I
Love
Thine!
I love you!!!!


A final project would involve three to six new poems and / or a small
love poetry anthology booklet with a dedication.

we were talking about how every good book has a religious moment
the author realizes he or she is just so small
the author gives himself or herself up to a higher power
the sublime grasps the hand of the author

with great inspiration the author begins to write
it is the greatest inspiration in one's life

Lucas:

It's really not for me to defend John Yau's opinions about Pound,
especially since I don't know the article to which you refer.  But I
would suggest that Yau's simultaneously criticizing Pound and showing
Pound's influence is really no more surprising than Pound himself
calling Whitman "pig-headed" at the same time that he acknowledges
him as a "father."  Indeed, Yau's ambivalence toward Pound is, I
think, characteristic of his ambivalence toward "Chinese" influences
throughout his work (and in the work of other American
writers/artists): they can be enormously generative and provide us
with a tremendously expanded poetic vocabulary, but at the very same
time they can be restrictive and even repressive in the cultural
images they provide, inevitably marked by the way Chinese influences
have made their way into American culture (a process in which
imperialism and racism play an unavoidable part).  That ambivalence
is heightened for a Chinese American writer whose relation to Chinese
sources is always going to be read differently than that of a (white)
writer like Pound.

Again, I want to echo Rich's very good point that "imperialism" and
"racism" are not merely situational, deriving from the conscious
intentions of doing harm by a particular actor at a particular
moment.  To say a work is imperialist, or marked by imperialism, is
not to say it is just bad and that no good can come of it; it is a
statement about the conditions of global and cultural power under
which that work is written.

I am guessing that you provide the quote from Chang, Lew, Tabios, and
Yau as an example of the extremity of their rhetoric--implying that
such a charge is (like the charge of "imperialism" against Pound)
simply unfair.  But I must say that I find their analysis of the
Yasusada affair nuanced and entirely apt, precisely because they look
beyond the simplistic claim, "Well, if the poems themselves are
'good,' all other questions are moot."  Instead, they recognize that
such "extrapoetic" issues--authorship, nationality, politics,
race--are in fact *precisely* the point of the Yasusada project,
since these poems are a conscious attempt by a white American writer
to speak in the voice of a Japanese poet (a victim, moreover, of an
American horror) and then to disavow his own authorship.  The
reception of Yasusada, even before the revelation of the "hoax,"
shows that these issues guided and aided the reading of the text
among American writers, and that the poems' author quite consciously
played upon American expectations about Japanese writing and
subjectivity in order to make his point.  Chang, Lew, Tabios, and
Yau's final point describes precisely what I think is going on with
Andrew's poem and the subsequent discussion: "he wants the taint of
scandal without having to take responsibility for the stereotypes he
celebrates."

In this sense, Yau's remark that Pound is just "a man of his time" is
a way of letting Pound off the hook--perhaps, given his own
circumstances, he did the best he could.  But the flipside is that
we, writing today, ought to know better.  A poem such as Andrew's
*knows* that it is dealing in racist stereotypes, and does so with
the intention of disavowing responsibility for such stereotypes when
called out on them.

Finally, on the "dog-eating" issue.  Frank Wu's _Yellow: Race in
America Beyond Black and White_ has an entire chapter devoted to the
question, "Do Asians eat dogs?"  After running through the possible
and more obvious ways to respond to such a query--the
"assimilationist" answer ("No, we don't; and if other Asians do we
don't approve of it"), the "multiculturalist" answer ("Sure, they do;
what's wrong with that?")--before concluding that the real response
should be, "What is the point of the question?"  In short, one needs
to inquire into the motive behind the rhetoric--to expose the fact
that pretty much the only function of raising the issue is a way of
making Asians the subject of a punchline, to place them outside
civilized behavior.  (Just about an hour ago I had the TV on and
heard a South Asian American doctor character remark offhandedly that
a lost dog ought to be disposed of according to "traditional Korean
wisdom": in other words, by being eaten.)  The image is pretty much
never employed innocently.

Maybe the best commentary on the stereotype I've ever seen, though,
is a prose piece by Filipino American writer R. Zamora Linmark called
"They Like You Because You Eat Dog."  I've been thinking about it
during this whole discussion, in fact, because this prose poem bears
some surface resemblances to Andrew's, in particular the anaphoric
structure (in Linmark's case, "They like you because...").  Linmark's
piece (which can be found in the anthology _Charlie Chan Is Dead_ as
well as online at
http://eths.sfsu.edu/aas214s2004/Project/timbutler.html) shows how
the image of "eating dog" is part and parcel of a whole constellation
of images about Asians as abject and subservient--many of which,
again, echo some of the same stereotypes Andrew uses.  But the poem,
to my mind, has that critical edge that Andrew's lacks.  To begin
with, it situates stereotypes not as a series of rhetorical questions
that take their premises for granted ("WHY DO THE TIAWANESE..."), but
as the product of the observer's power and expectations ("They like
you because...").  It more forcefully foregrounds the relations of
power between the objectified, Filipino "you" and the "they" that
consume such images; its cultural specificity is such as to resist
the generalities in which Andrew's poem indulges; it shows a full
register of expression, from pride to parody to self-loathing and
resentment; and ultimately its humor and critique touch both sides of
the equation: "They like you because--give it a few more
years--you'll be just like them. / And when that happens, will they
like you more?"

All:
About 50 professors told me during my undergrad and grad days the real =
measure of the greatness of a literary work was the influence the work =
had on other writers and the measure of how many words of commentary or =
criticisms were created about the piece.=20

If I apply that standard to Andrew's work "Why do the Taiwanese,"  I =
conclude the work is a masterpiece. =20

By my estimates, more than 10,000 words of criticism/commentary have =
already been posted about the piece, and the poem is less than a month =
old. =20

Better yet, the work has inspired critical comparisons that dredged up =
great writers from the past to lend credibility to the critical =
comments, e.g. Ezra Pound and "Why to the Taiwanese?  That was a bit of =
a stretch for me, but...why not. "

And I'm certain the poet is sitting back in his musty room taking notes =
about the reactions to the reactions to the reactions, etc...and =
preparing his dissertation.  Don't you just love our systems?

Andrew,=20
Let's get serious. =20

The poem is clever; it is witty; it is urbane, and yes, it is racist.  =
More importantly, it is also in need of revision.  The rewrite should =
make no attempt to purge the piece to please Timothy...it's not your =
issue that he finds fault with the racism in the piece.  That's his =
issue to come to grips with...you have in fact come to grips with your =
elements of the racism feelings by having put your feelings into words =
in the poem. (racism is an evil thing only when it attempts to subjugate =
or insult others; at other times it is merely an emotional outlet of our =
normal, human, fears when we recognize we are not the same as those who =
surround us.)=20

And in the future, Andrew, do your poems an enormous favor by never =
apologizing for them! =20

You wrote what you wrote.  Some enjoyed reading the piece; others found =
the work personally insulting and demeaning.  To both readers you should =
say, "thank you for having read my work." =20

Focus your rewrite efforts on pleasing yourself.  If the end product =
alienates some, so be it. =20

More importantly, do not...repeat, DO NOT, allow the intellectual =
diatribe here on the List to move you in any way from writing what is =
true to you.  Timothy may dislike the work when it is finished, but you =
must ask yourself this: "are you writing to impress/please Mr. Yue, or =
are you writing to give vent to your true feelings?"   The appropriate =
answer should be more than self evident to both you and the critics.  =
And if Timothy fails to understand that even he has racist =
feelings...that too is his problem, not yours, and his feelings should =
have no bearing upon the content of your work.  Let him write his own =
poem. =20

Please, let the work speak for itself...if you can't do that, then, I =
suggest you trash the work and start on something else, something less =
controversial.  How about Canadian Maple Syrup as an analgesic for the =
headaches caused by reading racist poetry?  That should get your heart =
to thumping?

In any event, Andrew, thank you for having generated so much =
enthusiastic commentary.
I have thoroughly enjoyed reading all the posts regarding the piece; in =
fact the comments far out weighed the poem's value in its current form.  =
Get your ass off to rewrite, soon.=20
Alex  =20

I'm not particularly a fan of Jane Hirschfield, but I've always enjoyed
this one poem from _The October Palace_:

THE GROUNDFALL PEAR

It is the one he chooses,
yellow, plump, a little bruised
on one side from falling.
That place he takes first.

First, Tim, I should apologize since I think I am the one who confused you
in my posts with Timothy Liu, a mistake that had more to do with something I
was reading not connected to this list or this thread and a conversation
about this thread that got your two names confused in my head, and I just
never read the headers of your posts carefully enough to make sure I got
your name right in my own. That said, there are some things in each of the
last few posts regarding this thread that I'd like to respond to. I have
separated my responses to different people/posts by a line of asterisks:

Tim wrote:

>>Rich also raises the interesting point that most of the responses
and defenses of the poem have been addressed directly to me, even
though he has, if anything, been more forceful in labeling Andrew's
poem as racist. I suppose the implication is that a charge of racism by an
Asian American is understood to be racially motivated and hence
one-dimensional, while Rich's similar arguments can safely be
regarded as balanced and nuanced.

We would not regard a white American of German or Irish descent as an
attenuated representative of Germany or Ireland; yet people of Asian descent
in the U.S. are seen as somehow elementally tied to their ancestral
cultures.  Hence we lose on both counts: attenuated Asians, not-quite
Americans.  This is why, frankly, many Asian Americans are so vigilant in
critiquing perceptions of Asians by Americans; we know that these
perceptions affect us very directly.<<

I want to highlight these two quotes because they raise the very
uncomfortable question of the degree to which we perceive racism as being,
primarily, and maybe even exclusively, the problem of the people who are the
objects of whatever racial hatred we happen to be talking about, in this
case Asian-Americans, and not of everybody else who lives in the society
where such racism is present. That's a horribly abstract way of asking the
question, but I have put it that way because I think the question goes far
beyond this particular thread and the fact that Tim is Asian-American and I
am not, and because I want as much as possible to avoid any sort of
romanticizing or sentimentalizing my own position in this conversation, but
I do wonder--and I have been struggling for a half hour now with how to
phrase this question so that it is clear, and I am afraid I will fail to be
clear no matter what I say--about the degree to which we perceive those
people who are not the objects of racial hatred but who nonetheless speak
out against it as acting primarily out of a kind of selflessness, in
defense, so to speak, of those who are the objects of racial hatred, and so
they, the unhated (god, what a horrible construction!) become invisible in a
way because they are not seen as having anything truly personal, and
therefore selfish, stake in the issue. I do not want to deny that, in this
case, Tim's personal stake in speaking out against anti-Asian/Asian-American
racism is far more obvious and immediate than mine. He is Asian-American and
I am not, but this racism--all racism, of course, but I'm speaking in the
context of this thread--has shaped and continues to shape my own life in
ways that I did not/do not want/like, according to values that I reject, and
that are differently, but I would argue no less deeply personal than the
ways in which racism has shaped and, as evidenced by this thread, continues
to shape Tim's life as well. Now, it may be that my posts have not made this
personal stake as clear as it could be, and I'm not even sure they should
have, since that discussion would have taken us deeply into my personal life
and far a field from the questions raised by Andrew's poem--and I feel I
need to say again that I am not interested in romanticizing or
sentimentalizing my position in this thread--but I do want at least to raise
the question of whether people have not responded to me because the issues
at stake in this thread are understood, implicitly or otherwise, not to be
"really" mine. (Which is another way of saying, though from a different
angle, what I think Tim means when he says, "I suppose the implication is
that a charge of racism by an Asian American is understood to be racially
motivated and hence one-dimensional, while Rich's similar arguments can
safely be regarded as balanced and nuanced.")

*************************************************************************

In one of his recent posts, Lucas wrote:

>>This is a good point. But it's not exactly what I meant. I don't know how
to explain this other than by an anecdote. A few years ago on Martin Luther
King day I needed to do some laundry. I joked to a friend of mine, "I think
the laundromat will be open today, because they still separate whites from
colors". He laughed, but also said it was racist. I don't think it was
racist. I think it was a joke that played on racism.<<

If by "racist" we mean a direct attack on someone or some group who is the
object of racial hatred, then, no, I don't think the joke is racist per se,
though, as Lucas acknowledges, it does "play on" racism. But if racist means
participating in racialized discourse from a position of privilege without,
since none of us can escape participating in racialized discourse, at the
same time acknowledging and taking responsibility for that privilege--and
this, it seems to me, is a much more powerful and politically useful way of
thinking about racism--then the joke is racist, though that of course does
not mean that Lucas is a racist in the first sense of the term that I
defined above. The fact that we have available to us a discourse in which
"separating whites from colors" can have the dual meaning that makes the
joke possible is the result of our living in a racist culture, and there is
no way to avoid the fact that the joke perpetuates that discourse even as
it, the joke, uses humor to deflate it, the discourse. Which leads me to the
next quote I want to bring from Lucas' post:

>>To look at how racism/anti-semitism functions in T. S. Eliot's plays (or
in our appreciation of Othello or Merchant of Venice, two other prominent
examples) is still, in some ways, to criticise their racism. But I guess I'm
still reading more irony in Andrew's poem than others--Rich and Timothy (Yu,
not Liu, by the way: Timothy Liu is another Chinese-American poet)--are
willing to give it.<<

That Andrew's poem gestures in the direction of irony, the kind of irony
with which Lucas obviously meant his joke, is clear to me. For me, the issue
in the poem, the problem with it, is that the irony is not fully realized
for all of the reasons that Tim and I have cited in our earlier posts.
Another way of saying this, I suppose, is that I am not willing to give
Andrew (in terms of his responsibility as a writer, not in terms of whether
or not he is a racist) or his speaker the benefit of the doubt here,
precisely because the material he has chosen to deal with is so incendiary.
From the point of view of the poem, my only point has been that it needs
revision, not to purge it of its racism, but to give that racism a context
that makes clear the speaker's position in relation to it so that I as a
reader can then take a position in relation to it. (And I don't particularly
care what that context is; that's something for Andrew to figure out if he
chooses to work on the piece.)

>> And finally, from Stephen's interview:

Arriving and living in Nsukka put me into a wonderful state of shock. At
once it was humbling. I quickly realized that there was no way I was going
to write authoritatively about the African experience. I was from a country
about 200 years old and suddenly in a world with languages and traditions
that went back hundreds, if not thousands of years.

This is a very touching point, and I think one of the real problems with
Andrew's poem, and my own posts, is that we have not built--or else have
lost--that humility keeping us from writing authoritatively about the Asian
experience.<<

True enough, but it doesn't mean we can't write authoritatively about our
experience of Asia, or Africa, and I think it's not that Andrew has tried
and failed to write authoritatively about the Asian experience, but he has
failed to write authoritatively and with humility about his own experience
of Asia.

***************************************************************************

And these from Lucas' subsequent post:

>>Really, I've rarely had such a nuanced discussion leading from the simple
question of whether someone is or isn't, or should or shouldn't be, offended
by a piece of writing.<<

While I agree with Lucas' characterization of this discussion, I am
wondering if stating the question this simply does not do a disservice to
Tim's original response to Andrew's poem, which was about a great deal more,
I thought, than whether or not Tim was personally offended. It seems to me
that one could find a piece of writing offensive without calling it into
question in the way that Tim did to Andrew's, though I am not saying that
Tim was not also personally offended. Here, again, I am just being leery of
reducing the issue of racism to one of giving personal offense.

>>Or maybe it's just as simple as I don't think it's racist to refer to
Taiwanese as dog-eating when a lot of Taiwanese people eat dogs (and so do
mainlanders and Koreans and I think Japanese). As long as somewhere along
the line we're able to acknowledge that Taiwanese are not _only_ dog-eaters,
and that eating dog meat is something we as North Americans can choose to
accept or reject, then what's wrong with saying out-loud that Taiwanese
people eat dog meat?<<

True enough, but where does Andrew's poem acknowledge this? It again comes
down, for me, to the problem of the poem's undeveloped irony/speaker's
voice/whatever you want to call it, and that comes down to the question of
the writer's responsibility for what he or she writes. That "somewhere along
the line" is the point at which the writer should take responsibility. I
don't think Andrew ever reached that point in his poem.

****************************************************************************

From Alexander Saliby's post:

>>About 50 professors told me during my undergrad and grad days the real
measure of the greatness of a literary work was the influence the work had
on other writers and the measure of how many words of commentary or
criticisms were created about the piece. If I apply that standard to
Andrew's work "Why do the Taiwanese,"  I conclude the work is a
masterpiece.<<

Andrew's poem raises very important questions, precisely because it fails
and because of the way it fails. That does not make it a great poem, though
I recognize that Alexander was probably speaking tongue-in-cheek; but it
does make Andrew's attempt to write it courageous and worthy of discussion.
The distinction is an important one and it is equally important to be
accurate in characterizing what that discussion has been, which I think
Alexander is not when he writes:


"The rewrite should make no attempt to purge the piece to please
Timothy...it's not your issue that he finds fault with the racism in the
piece.  That's his issue to come to grips with...you have in fact come to
grips with your elements of the racism feelings by having put your feelings
into words in the poem."

Timothy has not, nor have I, ever suggested that Andrew should purge his
poem of anything, nor that he should rewrite it to please anyone but
himself. It is precisely the unrevised, raw, undigested, undeveloped,
pick-your-adjective nature of the poem that Timothy and I have been
commenting on, when we have been commenting on the poem itself. And, in
fact, each of us has suggested that what Andrew needs to do, if he chooses,
is rewrite, and that he needs to rewrite not so much with what we have been
saying in mind, but keeping in mind what he himself said in his subsequent
posts about himself and his intentions for the poem. Most of the other
discussion about racism and so on has arisen in response to people's
(including Andrew's, at least initially) attempts either not to face, or to
apologize for, or to ameliorate the racism that is in the poem. This
distinction is also important because while Alexander may have been trying
here to give voice to what Andrew's anxieties might be in trying to rewrite,
rather than to characterize what Timothy's responses to the poem have
actually been, these sentences, as well as others in Alexander's post, are
written in such a way to make it seem that Timothy has actually tried to
tell Andrew how he should rewrite his poem and what politically correct line
Andrew ought to toe in doing so. That is not fair to Timothy, and I think it
does as well a disservice do Andrew's own attempts to talk about his poem,
which I thought of not as an apology, but as a fair and reasonable attempt
to engage the issues the poem raised and that Andrew made clear he had
wanted to raise and discuss through the vehicle of the poem. I didn't agree
with all that Andrew had to say in those subsequent posts, and I thought
some of it was, frankly, self-serving in defense of the poem, but for a
writer to engage discussion of why a poem does or doesn't work, especially
when the writer himself acknowledges that the poem is unfinished, raw,
undigested, whatever--in other words, while the poem is still a
draft--hardly seems to me to be an apology for the work. As well, given that
there are real issues of poetics, i.e., how does one deal with racism in a
poem? How does one give expression to racist sentiments without writing a
poem that is racist in the sense that it contributes to the oppression of
others? How does one develop a distancing irony? A fully fleshed out
character in a poetic monologue? What is the difference between a rhetorical
question and one which positions the questioner and the one being questioned
in clear and specific ways? These are only a few of the possible questions
that could be raised--and none of them, I will hasten to add, may be
relevant to Andrew--but they are all questions that could be raised about
Andrew's poem, that Timothy and I have commented on in one way or another,
most explicitly in Timothy's recent posting of the link to R. Zamora
Linmark's poem.

Ah well, my son needs his breakfast, so I guess that's all for now.

This indeed has been a stimulating thread but one which throws off far more
questions, areas of doubt, than answers. A few matters can be addressed with
some specificity though: one is the notion of Pound as the 'inventor' of
China. Now, narrowing that down, for the generation and the readership in
which Cathay occurred, Chinese poetry in English translation was principally
represented by Arthur Waley, not Pound. Interest in faraway places in that
age before 747's was high and romanticised and of course too exploitative,
so one has a gamut embracing notions of concessions and money-making on the
one hand (an extreme example, Mr Bedford, the narrator of H.G.Wells' 'First
Men in the Moon', dreams of establishing a 'Bedfordicia' there, as in
'Rhodesia') to the fantasies of Shangri-la or the Theosophists. There aren't
any easy answers on the matters generated by Andrew's poem - take some
attitudes to an extreme and you will find the notion than any writing by a
white person of roughly European descent about non-white cultures is by
definition racist, therefore, for instance, J.H.Prynne's interest in Chinese
poetry becomes so, which is rather ironical as one gathers that his writing
is well-regarded in China. One cannot use labels as a substitute for
thought: terms like 'racist' or 'sexist' do apply in some contexts. Let me
give an example: I have this on report - the other week we had the annual
Gay Pride march and festival here in Leicester. At the finale a speech was
given by our incoming Lord Mayor, who is a Sikh, the gist of the speech was
that as Leicester is a multi-cultural society gays are to be 'tolerated'
(his own word). The result of the speech, I am told, was to leave people
'speechless'. Now if one criticises that gentleman for his attitude is one
being racist? No.

Btw archaeological digs in the older English towns have frequently
discovered remains of both dogs and cats in the poorer quarters that had
clearly been eaten by humans in times of want.

Thought I'd throw that in.

Best

Well, that was a bad day.  I've recently returned from London and Paris.

In English, Wyatt (They flee from me) - Donne - the Shakespeare of the
Sonnets (particularly as it's not clear who they were addressed to or
whether he meant a single word of it all) - some Dryden translations or
imitations of antique Romans like Horace. A wonderfully forlorn piece by Ben
Jonson (On his picture going abroad), Hardy's laments from Poems of 1912-13
and the dying Keats' sad piece to Fanny Brawne (Bright star, would I were)
and of course Marlowe's sexy versions of Ovid. Curious that in considering
poetry in English one doesn't come up with many women writers which is an
interesting side-angle on sexual stereotypes, women DON'T write about love
all that much, there are Elizabeth Barret Browning's dreadful pieces (how do
I love thee - let me count the ways) but they should have a verbal health
warning on them. Emily Dickinson of course does have some interesting poems
implying a (non-existent) lover.

Lots in non-English - two suggestions - Michelangelo and Tsvetsaya.

Hi Folks--For a one-day session in a course on beginning poetry, I'd be
interested in having your recommendations for poems about love and/or
eros.  I want to mix up some old canonical favorites (happy to have your
votes on these) with other more playful or perverse or unfamiliar stuff.

thanks,

 The MAIN reason I can't read
The whole "Why do the Taiwanese" arguement anymore
is because it sounds to me like a glorified academic way to deal with the
subject of racism.

People are arguing with, criticizing, or lauding
NOT the poem,
but racism in general. Or, they are tryign to prove that racism is  genuine,
prevalent, and i would argue...natural. (see below). Or is it just a
coincidence that we are so interested in this poem, although we all agree
it's not extremely well-written? Does it have nothing to do with fear and
anger, translated into literary criticism?

How can I call racism "natural"? I feel it is natural within the context of
our culture. It doesn't take any effort to be racist. I don't care what
people say: you don't have to be raised by "racists" ( particularly racist
people, people who use derrogatory words) to be racist.  Even if you went to
a liberal arts university and read all types of multicultural things, you
have friends in a rainbow of colors, you joined Anti-Racist Club -- well,
you would still have stereotypes somewheer deep down in you. As long as you
have them, people will pop up to fill them.  And some of them do seem to be
treu, as far as patterns. When I say patterns, you can say "More Taiwanese
Probably Do ___ Than Americans." Sociology has proved that one is able to do
this. I'm sorry, but many of the poor African-American (black? etc) men
downtown DO think I am source of money downtown, and many of them treat me
as such each day (more so than other African-Americans). They, more than any
other group, seem to think it is appropriate to comment on my sex appeal,
often doing so in a method that suggests they are trying to upset or
frighten me.

I struggle with stereotypes and racism. I want to be less racist, use less
harmful stereotypes, have more multicultural friends, learn more about
different people, be extremely open minded, etc, etc, etc. And yet I am only
a person. I want to realize that just because more non-whites are _____
doesn't mean this is an essential characteristic of the people.

I do believe that everyone's a little racist: perhaps at some time it was
helpful for us to do so.  We needed to take care of our own people at home
rather than foreginers: it helped us preserve the species our the group by
avoiding and even fearing others, "strangers." Now all these races are here.
Now "home" isn't all thats important. Now it's time to change.

Perhaps our "critics" should  post a poem to the effect of that they think
should be written to express "culture shock" or parody racism. Or we could
have a series, poems that skate around racism, or racist poems. It could be
a project; write a racist poem and post it. Everyone can? Of course I am
kind of joking.  Or am I??
 We know these racist stereotypes are in all of us, and all of us could
write them.  We know about them, in any case.  I could even write
stereotypical poems about my own race that would be just as untrue as the
racist ones I could write.

"WHY DO THE WHITE PEOPLE
make fun of African-American names?"

or "WHY DO WE?" of course, my "WE" would be as elusive and ridiculous as the
group  "AFRICAN AMERICANS" or "BLACK PEOPLE" or "TAIWANESE". There is no
white WE I am a part of! If I ever, ever relied on that particular "WE" for
anything, I would be shit out of luck!

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I've read with some interest the "Tiawan" thread although not all the issues involved interest me.  Pound, in England, was an anti-Imperialist writer, with a mild satiric bent.  Mauberly, Homage to Propertius and Cathay are all critiques of Imperial England, its culture, society, etc.  In Cathay Pound was running in tandem with Waley in creating a version of imperial China and its scholar bureaucrat elite, a positive contrast to the English imperial elite that at the same time mirrored what Pound perceived as worthwhile in the English tradition.  Pound doesn't go quite as far as Waley in assimilating the shi dafu / literatus to the educated English gentleman, but the tendency is the same.  I think what John Yau was suggesting, about Pound, was that Pound's use of China was something in the Boston English-language culture he grew up in that valued China, and maybe the first thing he encountered to do so.  When I knew John, 25 years ago, I thought he was somewhat ambivalent abo
 ut his
 Chinese heritage.  In any case, the Taiwan mainstream seems to reject the idea that Taiwan is part of China, so why is anyone talking about China in a thread about Taiwan?  duoxie hezuo.

Recently helped start a Zukofsky-Neidecker group and here I am deep in the
throes of A-8 while Taiwan -like some curious satellite, curious moon or
mixed globalist metaphor - has been circling over this listserv. And it
strikes me that Z - first generation of the start of the last century Jewish
emigrant/immigrant, Yiddish speaking home (the story shd be well known) is
here early in "A" - the late thirties continuously seized by the materials
of his new country, turning them into an interpretive history - partly
through the genius of his ear for apprehending and utilizing the new
language (literary Brit English, American vernacular), going after the gems
(Henry Adams Brahmin Amer/English thought), the grain in the craft in
indigenous goods, folk stories and Christianity as a theatrical form,
hammering Marx and new science into issues of labor & the ethical mix -
welding and wielding it all into an inescapably engaging music.

I have no idea what it's really like to be in Taiwan or the ways in which
the place can be fully approached as a writer - but I do think Zukofsky's
work sets a standard for being open, critical and integrative (comparable
and different among other Objectivists and WCW among writers) and I think
there are many valuable lessons to be returned to and studied here.

Not to repeat arguments I've already made at great length, but
hopefully to clarify.

One thing I've learned in this discussion is that to raise the issue
of racism is to have people make certain assumptions about your
motives.  According to some recent posts by Alexander Saliby and
David Bircumshaw, anyone who raises questions about racism supposedly
claims

1. to be totally free of racism themselves

2. that no one should ever write about a culture that is not their own

3. that no criticism of a non-white person is permissible

Now, I may not be an objective reader of my own posts, but I
certainly don't believe I ever said any of these things.  That they
are, directly or indirectly, being attributed to me I can explain
only by recognizing that these are common responses to discussions of
racism: charging anyone who would point out racism with hypocrisy,
self-righteousness, narrow-mindedness and just plain stupidity.  If
someone wants to say that about the arguments I actually did make
they are free to do so, but it seems odd to hold me responsible for
assertions like the three above.

Finally, I do feel I have to respond to Alex Saliby's strange claim
that I am trying to tell Andrew how he should revise his poem.  I'm
doing nothing of the sort.  I see no evidence that Andrew is at all
interested in trying to "impress" or "please" me--quite the opposite,
in fact--and I have no idea why he'd feel he should.  Nor do I see
any evidence that Andrew has been "apologizing" for his poem in his
posts; again, quite the contrary.

Andrew posted his poem to this list.  I presume that was an action
that invited response, and I offered one.  What Andrew does with that
response, and all the others, is his business; I'm not his teacher or
his workshop leader.  I'm merely a reader with a strong opinion; and
if anything I took Andrew more, rather than less, seriously by
reading his poem as a finished piece and not a mere draft.  My
response is an interpretation and not a suggestion for improvement.

I'm under no illusions that my arguments will dissuade Andrew or
anyone else from continuing to write poems in this vein; indeed, I am
rather resigned to the fact that my objections, and the resulting
discussion, will likely encourage Andrew to write more poems of
comparable logic and rhetoric.  I would find that to be a shame;
others, like Alex, might find it delightful.  Nonetheless, I've
continued these arguments because I felt the potential benefits
outweighed the risks; because the issues touched on are ones that
need to be raised and considered; because I felt I had to offer a
perspective that's not often heard here; and because I'd like to
think that this list, however maddening it may be at times, still
offers a frank and open forum for discussion of the most vexed issues
in poetry and politics.  Thanks to all those who have contributed
their thoughts to this debate.

thank *you,* timothy, and othes, for so persistently trying to be
understood in the face of defensiveness that so often accompanies even the
whisper of the word 'racism.'

Harry Potter and the Capitalist Pigs fails to charm the French left
By John Lichfield in Paris
05 July 2004


In the très sérieux columns of Le Monde, a debate is raging, which slices
to the heart of the political and philosophical concerns of the early 21st
century. Is Harry Potter a capitalist neo-liberal? Or is he an
anti-globalist lefty, concerned by the fate of the humble and the
oppressed?

The opinion pages of the centre-left French daily - more often occupied
with human cloning or Third World debt - have, over the past three weeks,
been examining, in high Marxist-structuralist manner, the political
subtext of the works of J K Rowling.

The Great Debate was launched on 4 June by Ilias Yocaris, maître de
conférences of French literature at the Institut Universitaire de
Formation de Maîtres in Nice.

M. Yocaris, among those responsible for training the next generation of
French teachers, complained in Le Monde that the "fantasy universe of
Harry Potter is ... a capitalist universe". The five Harry Potter books -
enormously successful in French translation - are stuffed with
"neo-liberal stereotypes" which caricature approvingly the "excesses of
the Anglo-Saxon social model", M. Yocaris said.

Thus all representatives of the state (the Ministry of Magic) are
lampooned as ridiculous, or incompetent or sinister. Harry goes to a
"private" school, whose "micro-society" is a "pitiless jungle" which
glorifies "individualism, excessive competition and a cult of violence".

Public institutions are unable to protect individuals. Au contraire, Harry
Potter and his friends find they have to break the magical state-imposed
rules constantly to protect themselves from evil forces.

M. Yocaris says the Harry Potter books are an example of the totalitarian
universe imagined by George Orwell, come to life. "Capitalism is now
trying to shape, after its own taste, not only the real world, but the
imaginary world of its consumer-citizens," he says.

Now Le Monde has published an equally erudite reply to M. Yocaris's
thesis. Far from being a capitalist lackey, Harry Potter is, in fact, the
first fictional hero of the anti-globalist, anti-free market, pro-Third
World, "Seattle" generation, Isabelle Smadja believes.

Mme Smadja, who teaches philosophy at the Lycée Loritz in Nancy, suggests
M. Yocaris has been confused by the Potter books being such a global,
commercial and marketing success. Examination of the text suggests they
are, in fact, a "ferocious critique of consumer society and the world of
free enterprise".

The magical world created by J K Rowling is, Mme Smadja declares, suffused
with the ideas of "alter-mondialisme" or "other-worldism", the name given
to the anti-global movement in France.

Harry and his friends show creditable concern for the "house elves", the
unpaid servants of the magical world. But with the elves being mostly
content with their lot this is, says Mme Smadja, a "pertinent" critique of
globalisation.

"Poor countries are so blinded and attracted by the system which exploits
them that they have no desire to revolt against it", she adds.

French intellectuals have struggled to come to terms with the success of
the Potter books and movies. There have been structuralist and
post-structuralist interpretations, suggesting the books are "anti-
progressive" and "sexist". There have also been complaints in France that
many of the wicked characters in the books (Voldemort or vol de mort
[flight of death] ) - have French names.

OneLe Monde reader mocked the tendency of some French intellectuals to
wallow in ideological abstraction. "A question presents itself," Vincent
de Longueville from Paris asked in the newspaper's letters column. "Was
Ilias Yocaris ever young?"

Hi Timothy

I have followed this articulate and intelligent discussion with great
interest.  In part, aside from its intrinsic interest, I've found it
fascinating to see (yet again) how similar the topos of argument is to
discussions around gender.  By no means are the issues the same - each has
its own complexities and nuances - but there is so often a structural
similarity in how these things are spoken about.  The point you make below,
for example, is rather familiar to me, but I'm not sure I've been able to
respond with your measured clarity.

All the best

A

Timothy:

Even though I get the feeling a lot of readers may be ready for this thread
to end in sleep, I continue to push on, as this discussion has continued to
push me.

A number of new posts have been added to this sub-thread, so I hope we can
incorporate them all. Perhaps a switch to para-reply method will help?

Timothy wrote:

True. Likewise, my attempts to bring Yau's comments into the discussion are
a bit unfair to everyone who has not read the article, or has not read it
recently. Still, it's an important one in dealing with the question of what
happens when someone not of a certain culture or race works to represent a
certain culture or race in writing. And that is one of the many questions
buzzing around here, isn't it?

You give Yau the benefit of the doubt. I recommend you find the article.
It's much more fierce than "pig-headed father", especially as he sets up the
article. It's a long and vitriolic review of the poetry anthology "American
Poetry Since 1950: Innovaters and Outsiders", and Yau moves from saying that
Pound was imperialist and racist and had no interest in letting the Other
speak for him- or herself, to saying that the editor of the anthology (an
erstwhile friend of Yau's), in starting with Pound's translations of the
classical Chinese "Book of Odes", is also imperialist and racist and has no
interest in letting the Other speak for him- or herself. It's quite a
diatribe, really, and in no way does Yau in that article present himself as
well as you are here.

true, but. Not only in the context of a book review, where Yau calls the
editor and his project racist, resulting in potential readers not buying the
book, but in the context of North American political life, where accusations
and misaccusations of racism are particularly and poignantly damning (does
anyone remember the details of the professor who resigned after being
accused of using racist language, which was really just a misunderstanding
of the derivation of "calling a spade a spade"?), to fault a work of
literature for failing to meet up to our current values is to paint it
negatively.

I do understand the value of such criticism, when aimed in the opposite
direction: "What does the racism of Othello tell us about ourselves when we
respond to the play?", for instance. And even though I know you are at great
pains not to dismiss Andrew or his poem the way that public figures charged
with racism do get dismissed, the charge can be equally damaging. Whether
you need to take responsibility for extra-intentional connotations and
denotations any more than Andrew needs to take responsbility for your or my
reaction to "why do the tiawanese" is not the point. The point is that
racism is a serious charge, and it takes at once a serious sophistication to
get beyond its character-condemnation, as well as a serious naivete to think
that saying a work is "imperialist" is purely a historical description.

Is the charge unfair? As a charge, I don't think it's unfair. But as a
verdict, I think it's irrelevant and irresponsible. Your assumption,
furthermore, which is the assumption of many, that "these poems are a
conscious attempt by a white American writer to speak in the voice of a
Japanese poet ... and then to disavow his own authorship" is still, in the
end, an assumption. Just as you reminded me of Barthes and Fish, I will
remind you of same in putting the locus of the writing on a
single--especially assumed--author.

As it happens, I've been in contact with Kent Johnson for no short time. He
does not say, or even suggest, even in private conversation, that he is the
"real" author of Yasusada. Instead, he speaks of the event as a passionate
explainer, kind of the way you might expect from a literary executor of a
friend's estate. He responded, directly to me, to your reading of Yasusada,
and gave me permission to bring it into the discussion.

Kent says:
>>It's true that these issues are embedded in Yasusada, and obviously so,
but in what manner does their presence signify racist intent?? There's
simply no logic to Tim's statement here. Tim is also wrong to imply that
these more theoretical vectors are the *essence* of Yasusada's first purpose
and meaning, which was and is (for what it's worth, and whether it succeeds
or not) an empathic one-- to imagine a radical otherness through a poetic
act whose "transgressive" form seeks ways of engaging and understanding
beyond safe and approved modes. (Forrest Gander's remarks from The Nation
(essay reprinted in Jacket #4) seem apropos here-- and are better said:

"Yasusada proposes a radical contemporary aesthetic response to one of the
worst human atrocities, what Kai Bird, Gar Alperovitz, and others have amply
demonstrated as the absolutely unnecessary nuclear bombing of the civilian
populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by American military forces. Using
modernist strategies, the author(s), steeped in translations of Japanese
literature and feeling uneasy, even - if they are Americans - complicit with
the U.S. foreign policy that generated such mass destruction, invented an
imaginative, political and poetic act of empathy. To write poems concerning
Hiroshima, they felt it necessary to imagine themselves as the other, "the
enemy." They relinquished their own identities as authors and became
invisible, as the Hiroshima victims themselves disappeared. It is an
impossible gesture of solidarity, since one cannot become someone else and
since one cannot truly imagine one's way into an actual culture considerably
different from one's own. But nevertheless, it is a gesture worth making if
its resultant poetry is worthwhile as art, as poetry, as - finally -
contemporary Western poetry. In this gambit, Doubled Flowering is an
astonishing success."

(Lucas again):
Sorry for the Chinese box (ahem) style of this quotation-within-quotation
email. But I think that Kent's highlighting of "the *essence* of Yasusada's
first intent" of empathy, are important, even as I find authorial intent a
quicksand I'd like not to step into. But more on empathy later.

Kent also says, in response to Timothy's placement of the authorship on
white American shoulders:

>>The ethnicity of the author or authors of Yasusada is not publicly
acknowledged and never will be. What Tim Yu and others must be asked is
whether the bombing of Hiroshima and its ethical repercussions are reducible
in any way to ethnic and sociological parameters. Those who insist on such,
I'd propose, dishonor the victims of that massive crime and the *human*
present and future they have suffered for-- and they dishonor, likewise, the
urgently universal message of hibakusha literature, a body of testimony to
which a gesture like Yasusada remains a shadow, to be sure... Moreover, an
interesting blindness of sorts is revealed in Tim's parenthetical remark
above: The fact that Hiroshima *is* also an American horror is precisely
what complicates the whole matter-- Japanese and American "faces" are in
profound ways fused in the power of the event's unprecedented meaning. (By
the way, the second Yasusada book coming out shortly from Mike Magee's Combo
Press --Yasusada's letters in English-- will carry an afterword by a leading
Japanese scholar of Hiroshima roots, whose relatives are hibakusha. He has
published prominently on Yasusada in Japan, and his moving essay might lead
Tim and his co-thinkers, I think, to reflect a bit more on some of their
assumptions.)

(Lucas again):
This is, I think, an interesting point: the repercussions of Hiroshima and
such events are not reducivle to ethnic and sociological parameters. I am
moved when a French newspaper claims, on September 12, 2001, "Nous sommes
tous Americains", and I am insulted when former Chinese roommates in Paris
didn't care about the destruction of the lives in the twin towers because,
as they said, it didn't happen in their country. I do not think these
emotions have anything to do with me as an American, but rather with me as a
human. I find something inhuman--beyond even inhumane--when my former
Chinese roommates are not affected by two buildings full of people crushing
them all. I think to speak in terms of race and nationality at this point is
to miss something very serious.

Kent again:
>>This is a complex issue. But the poems, as is well known, wear their
fictional status boldly on their sleeve. Is it the fault of the writer(s)
that the poems had the specific intitial history they did? Why were the open

other instances of "self-exposure" that still haven't been commented on,
incidentally.) Why is the author[s] to be so blamed if he, she, or they,
initially and provisionally, chose to present the poems in the
"heteronymous" spirit under which they were written? Was Pessoa likely
irresponsible? Kierkegaard? The author of the Tosa Diary? I think the real
question that needs to be asked is this: Why does Tim seemingly ignore what
has been the plain case now for ten years-- that Yasusada is a work of
fiction, a fiction openly proffered within a text written by an "author"
whose chosen authorial silence *is continuous with the meaning and spirit of
the work*? What is interesting, in other words, is how the simple desire of
a writer to not claim a work via his legal identity so troubles writers like
Yu, Yau, Lin, Lew, many Caucasian writers, etc.), and I believe it probably
troubles them in part because they happen to be, in their particular
institutional locations, invested in categories that rely --lock, stock, and
barrel-- on ideological rituals of conventialized authorship. A work like
Yasusada, apparently, threatens their hold (in their minds, anyway-- it
doesn't need to!) on instruments of classification and positioning-- ones
which, again, are incapable of containing the meanings and resonances of
Hiroshima.

Kent again:

and dismissed as, an act of "stereotyping." (Frankly, that Yasusada
represents a "stereotypical" image of a Japanese individual is a laughable
concept-- and should be, to anyone who has read the work or some of the
thoughtful secondary literature that has come in its wake.)

(Lucas again):
I see nothing sinister in Yasusada's creation of a character from another
race. Quite the contrary, I see it the way Kenneth Rexroth viewed his
translations: "an exercise of sympathy on the highest level". I see that
people who respond negatively to it are usually those who were, in some way,
fooled: the editors who believed that it was written by a true hibakusha
poet, and the like. But couldn't (shouldn't) that anger be directed at
themselves for not knowing more about Japanese writing, instead of against
the "purpetrators" of the "hoax"?

as far as this relates to Andrew's poem, I think it's clear that Andrew
"wants the scandal", but is also very willing to take responsibility for the
"stereotypes" he refers to. And I don't see a "celebration" in either
(Yasusada or Tiawanese) case.

Perhaps this would be an interesting place to splice Rich's comments about
racism when called out by a non-direct victim of racism:

Rich:
>>> I want to highlight these two quotes because they raise the very
uncomfortable question of the degree to which we perceive racism as being,
primarily, and maybe even exclusively, the problem of the people who are the
objects of whatever racial hatred we happen to be talking about, in this
case Asian-Americans, and not of everybody else who lives in the society
where such racism is present. That's a horribly abstract way of asking the
question, but I have put it that way because I think the question goes far
beyond this particular thread and the fact that Tim is Asian-American and I
am not, and because I want as much as possible to avoid any sort of
romanticizing or sentimentalizing my own position in this conversation, but
I do wonder ... about the degree to which we perceive those
people who are not the objects of racial hatred but who nonetheless speak
out against it as acting primarily out of a kind of selflessness, in
defense, so to speak, of those who are the objects of racial hatred, and so
they, the unhated (god, what a horrible construction!) become invisible in a
way because they are not seen as having anything truly personal, and
therefore selfish, stake in the issue. I do not want to deny that, in this
case, Tim's personal stake in speaking out against anti-Asian/Asian-American
racism is far more obvious and immediate than mine. He is Asian-American and
I am not, but this racism--all racism, of course, but I'm speaking in the
context of this thread--has shaped and continues to shape my own life in
ways that I did not/do not want/like, according to values that I reject, and
that are differently, but I would argue no less deeply personal than the
ways in which racism has shaped and, as evidenced by this thread, continues
to shape Tim's life as well. <<<

(Lucas again):
This is an interesting phenomenon, and one I haven't paid much attention to,
though certainly I've been susceptible to its pull. And while I know I'm not
responding to your point directly, Rich, I do think it would be interesting
to turn around and look at from the point of view of the writer. That is,
does the idea that (for the sake of argument--leaving aside the
never-racially-innocent notion of assumption about the Yasusada author) a
"white male north american" author created a Japanese poet also interact
with your position that the originally selfless becomes invisible? What I
mean is, can Yasusada be treated as a tribute to Japan, can Pound be read as
writing tributes to China, instead of putting these acts of translation in
terms of "yellowface" and "imperialism" and "stereotype"? Is the writer
writing against racism--even if he or she is referring to racist discourse
and, as Rich put it, "participating in racialized discourse"--always going
to be turned somewhat invisible (or more to the point: viewed as
Imperialist) as long as he or she is not from the culture in question?

In the post that just came in from Timothy, he says he never stated "that no
one should ever write about a culture that is not their own". That's true.
He never said this, never even suggested it. So I'm not attributing the
counter-point to Timothy when I ask, seriously, if in these times anyone who
writes about a culture other than his or her own is open to attack by people
who will think that, because of racial proximity, such writing is motivated
by darker impulses and discriminations?

When I say "these times" I mean the last fifteen to twenty years, probably.
About forty years ago the racial ideal was to ignore it: "content of
character" not "color of skin". I think a shift happened not too long ago
(Rich referred to this when he mentioned how white people used to want "us
all to be colorblind", when really that meant "pretend everyone is white")
where people decided that to look past a black person's blackness, a
hispanic's hispanicity, an asian's asianness, a gay person's gayness, is to
ignore a very large factor of what creates content of that person's
character. I wonder what others think about this observation, and whether it
has affected the way we read literature.

Timothy again:
> In this sense, Yau's remark that Pound is just "a man of his time" is

Again, I'm not sure that Andrew means to "disavow responsibility". And I
appreciate comments by David Bircumshaw, who pointed out that Arthur Waley,
not Pound, was the real keystone of bringing ancient China into the
anglophone world (I think _Cathay_ predated any of Waley's publications, but
I don't have the dates in front of me, so I could be wrong; nevertheless,
Waley's output as translator was massive, and his translations of poetry,
fiction, and philosophy from China, Korea, and Japan did much to broaden the
Anglophone's vision of the literary world), and that "terms like 'racist' or
'sexist' do apply in some contexts". This may be especially true in Pound's
case (I get the feeling that because he was a fascist and anti-semite, Pound
is an easy target for those who would claim other vices in his writing), as
Simon Schuchat noted, because Pound himself was an anti-imperialist writer
(though Simon: I think we are talking about China and Japan and Korea and
Taiwan and other places as part of the Asian context; furthermore, the
Taiwanese mainstream's rejection of political China has nothing to do with
cultural China, which is as much a part of Taiwan's history as any of us in
anglophone countries share with England).

Then call me a multiculturalist!

But if the "real response" should be an inquiry into the motives, then where
does that leave the imperialist critique of Ezra Pound's Chinese
translations? Where does that leave stereotyping in the Yasusada poems?
Where does that leave the racism in Andrew's poem?

The motives of all these acts of poetry seem pretty pure, and I'm not
convinced at all that "the only function of raising the issue [of
dog-eating] is a way of making Asians the subject of a punchline, to place
them outside civilized behavior". In Western civilization we throw a lot of
the animal away, but when as a grade-schooler I heard that American Indians
use every part of the animal, I heard it with a tone of admiration. And the
American Indians were uncivilized! (I mean that in the strict definition of
the word: no cities, no writing system, etc., and not as a value judgement).
When Kosher Jews refer to goyim eating pork, is "the motive behind the
rhetoric" to expose the gentiles as outside civilized behavior? This just
doesn't work for me.

Tone of voice is important. So are associations. Andrew wrote about dogs
being run over, which Timothy assosicated with dogs being eaten. So really,
Timothy, we have to ask: what is the point behind your association?

Yes, this a more mature and developed poem than "Why do the Tiawanese". I
particularly appreciate the way in which it doubly indicts the
Filipino/Asian/Asian-American subject and the Euro-American readership. But
the first line of the bio after the poem, "Rolling the R's was written by
gay Filipino author R. Zamora Linmark", reiterates the importance of the
author's identity to understanding the poetry. And this is the same trap we
fall into in assuming that Yasusada was written by a white man (or that this
matters), or that because Pound lived in the era of English colonialism then
he was a product of it (despite being neither English nor an apologist for
imperialism), and instead gets us to the same place where we value critiques
of racism most when they come from those directly insulted, and where Kent
can point out that Yasusada "probably troubles them [Yau, Chang, Lew, Lin]
in part because they happen to be, in their particular institutional
locations, invested in categories that rely --lock, stock, and barrell-- on
ideological rituals of conventialized authorship".

phew.

That was a lot to get through.

    Federal cuts hit home

30 households losing their subsidies from EHA
By Anne Marie Apollo
<mailto:aapollo@scn1.com?Subject=SuburbanChicagoNews.com.Story.Response>
STAFF WRITER

ELGIN -- Shirley Anderson waited six years for a Section Eight Housing
voucher from the Elgin Housing Authority.

In April, she got one. On Tuesday, she saw it slip away.

Anderson's is one of more than 30 households the housing authority cut
from its rolls this month, local casualties of federal changes made to
the program administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development.

Local housing authority officials said they didn't want to eliminate the
support, but a dwindling budget left them little choice. And more cuts
could be coming, they said.

In April, HUD announced that Congress had changed the formula to
calculate how much each housing authority receives for its Housing
Choice Voucher program. Commonly known as Section Eight, the program
gives low-income residents a subsidy allowing them to live in privately
owned residences instead of public housing.

This year, agencies were told the government would increase the amount
of their vouchers only according to the rate of inflation, not by the
amount the rent went up.

The change left many agencies, including the Elgin Housing Authority,
short of cash, as it came after their budgets for the year already were
completed.

Much of reserves spent
EHA Executive Director Sandra Freeman said the agency expects to get
several million dollars less than it did last year because of the
adjustment. The housing authority has taken steps recommended by HUD to
save money but still finds itself short, she said. Freeman added that
the agency had already spent 58 percent of what it had in reserve before
the cut. Because Congress left open avenues for housing authorities to
appeal for more money based on increased inflation for some vouchers,
the amount the EHA receives has fluctuated each month. In June, it took
in $40,000 less than expected, Freeman said. This month, $1,000 was
restored to its totals, but that wasn't enough to forestall the cuts.

The agency sent out letters on June 30 informing selected tenants that
their leases would be terminated. Those families have until the end of
the month to make other arrangements.

Freeman said some may be able to find housing in apartments owned by the
EHA.

The last households to get vouchers were the first to lose them, Freeman
said. She was unsure whether more reductions would be needed.

The Elgin Housing Authority has 913 clients with Section Eight vouchers.

More of them could be affected by cuts if Congress approves HUD's
proposed 2005 budget, which includes the new Flexible Voucher Program,
Freeman said.

Under that program, the EHA would receive a set amount for housing
vouchers that is not based on the actual number of units its clients rent.

According to HUD, changing the way the program is run will make it more
efficient and give local agencies more autonomy in how the money is spent.

A cruel joke
But those benefiting from the program are struggling to understand how
they will be affected.

When Juanita Brooks received a letter Friday stating her subsidy had
been terminated, she thought it was a cruel joke.

The full rent on her four-bedroom apartment is $1,200, an amount she
said she cannot afford on her own. Until recently moving into her
current Section Eight home, she'd been paying $750 a month to live in an
apartment at the River's Landing complex on Elgin's near-east side.

Brooks, who works full time, said she had to stay home Tuesday to try to
sort things out. She was first in line at the local housing authority
with questions about the letter, and she was the first to hear that
nothing could be done.

She and her three children moved to their new apartment in April after
waiting three years for a Section Eight voucher.

"And this is what I get in July," she said. "That I've got to go,
because there is no more funding. Why give me the voucher if they're
going to take it away?"

Shirley Anderson asked the same thing Tuesday.

She opened her letter Saturday afternoon and spent the entire weekend
trying to figure out where she would go with her two children at the end
of the month, she said.

The family moved out of Carpentersville's troubled Fox View Apartments
in April.

She said she doesn't have cash available to start over again, and her
new landlord is not pleased that the subsidy has been eliminated.

"This is a business for him," she said. "He wants his money."

>>Not only in the context of a book review, where Yau calls the

and misaccusations of racism are particularly and poignantly damning (does
anyone remember the details of the professor who resigned after being
accused of using racist language, which was really just a misunderstanding
of the derivation of "calling a spade a spade"?), to fault a work of
literature for failing to meet up to our current values is to paint it
negatively.

I do understand the value of such criticism, when aimed in the opposite
direction: "What does the racism of Othello tell us about ourselves when we
respond to the play?", for instance.<<

I do not know Yau's work or the essay that and other material that Lucas and
Tim and others have been referring to and so I cannot take on the question
of whether Yau was doing what Lucas suggests he was doing, but I do think
it's important to say that calling a work from another period racist (or
sexist, or whatever) does not have to mean faulting it "for failing to meet
up to our current standards"--a formulation which suggests, I think, that
somehow what we (whoever "we" are) write now is not informed by racism and
sexism and other values that we might prefer to be able to disown.

There are two points here, I think. The first and perhaps more obvious one
is that we may be more conscious of how those values work now, and we might
expect a writer trying to do now what, say, Pound tried to do in Cathay
(whatever that was; if this is a bad example, please substitute an
appropriate one) to be more conscious of how
racism/imperialism/colonialism/pick-your-ism works in writing/translation,
but it is important to acknowledge, I think, that those values would still
be present in whatever he produced, in ways he could not control, and so if
the standard is to eliminate racism (or sexism, etc.), we are always already
failing and so the standard is out of reach. (I should be clear that I am
not being defeatist here; it's just that I don't believe in utopia. The
oppressive values that are part of our culture are part of our culture. The
best we can do is be vigilant in making sure we, as individuals and
institutions, don't hurt people as a result of them.)

Which brings me to my second point. Lucas is right that one question we can
ask about the racism in a piece of work is what it tells us about ourselves
when we respond to it, but another question we can ask about it is, "How
did/does it shape our cultural vision of whomever the object of racism is?"
This is not just a question of personal response, though I do not want to
deny the importance of personal response. Assume, for the moment, that
whatever it means to call Pound's Cathay imperialist or racist is true. To
the degree that his text became a foundational text for others who wanted to
translate Chinese literature into English or write in what Pound's
translation foregrounded as the possibilities of writing in a "Chinese style
or of incorporating aspects of a Chinese poetic repertoire into English--to
the extent that the imperialism in his text went unexamined by those who
used his text, then their texts reproduced that imperialism and embedded it
even further into the cultural view of China embedded in English language
and literature. (This may apply only to the Englishes of the US and Britain
or only the US; I am not sure, but I think the point is clear.) And so there
is a level at which to call a work racist is not to dismiss it for failing
to live up to the progressive anti-racist standards we like to think we hold
ourselves to now--though I will not deny it is entirely possible to use a
charge of racism to invalidate a work's claim to legitimacy--but it is
rather to use what we understand now about how racism or imperialism works
to go back and look at how the work functioned within the culture where it
was produced. And I think this second way of asking questions about the
racism of a text produced in an earlier time gets lost in what seems to me
to be Lucas' focus on personal/individual responses. (I also should say that
I just realized I may have appeared to use racism and imperialism in what I
just wrote as if they are interchangeable; obviously they are not.)


>>The point is that racism is a serious charge, and it takes at once a
serious sophistication to get beyond its character-condemnation, as well as
a serious naivete to think that saying a work is "imperialist" is purely a
historical description.<<

This is a point worth thinking about, not because I think this is what has
gone on in this discussion--at least I don't think either Tim or I have used
to term racist to engage in any sort of character assassination or with any
sense that any kind of label does not have emotional content for those to
whom it is applied, those who apply and those who hear it being applied to
others. But it is worth asking why we find it so difficult to accept such
labels when they are accurate descriptions of something within ourselves;
why we--and here I mean those of who work in good faith to undo the damage
that racism and sexism, etc. do in whatever country/culture we happen to
live in--so often insist on accepting the dominant culture's insistence that
calling someone racist must mean a condemnation of who he or she is as an
entire human being rather than a description of one aspect of his or her
character that informs the way he or she lives in the world. What do I mean
by this: If I say that I struggle with my own sexism, or my own racism, or
homophobia, or my own sense of entitlement in the world as a citizen of the
United States, or the very strong sense of American/US exceptionalism it is
so difficult to escape if you are raised in this country--if I say that,
what am I saying about myself other than that I am struggling with a set of
values that were given to me, that I do not like/want to live my life
through and that I am aware I benefit from even when I don't want to, and
even when I try consciously not to benefit from them. Or if someone says to
me that I am somehow expressing those values, painful and embarrassing as it
may be for me to hear that, what are they saying other than that I have not
been successful in that moment, in that way, in maintaining the vigilance I
spoke about above, or, to put it another way, in taking responsibility for
the privilege I have here because of my gender, skin color, sexual identity,
whatever? For me, the pain that it might cause someone when I point out they
are being in any particular moment a racist, no, let me say this about
myself, the pain it causes me when someone points out to me that I have been
racist in something I have said or done is certainly not a welcome pain, but
I think it is a necessary pain, and it is one that I would rather not be
spared and that I refuse to bend over backwards to spare another, because it
is a pain that is a necessary part of my growth, of our growth as a culture,
away from the use of oppressive values to oppress people. And I will return
one more time to Andrew's poem: the point is not that he should not write
about what he chose to write about, the point, my point, Tim's point, is
that he should, if he wants to rewrite, work through the ways in which
racism works in his poem and decide how he wants his poem to comment
on/respond to that. Which is not the same thing as being willing to
acknowledge that he uses stereotypes in the poem.

I am not, but this racism--all racism, of course, but I'm speaking in the
context of this thread--has shaped and continues to shape my own life in
ways that I did not/do not want/like, according to values that I reject, and
that are differently, but I would argue no less deeply personal than the
ways in which racism has shaped and, as evidenced by this thread, continues
to shape Tim's life as well. <<<

Later in his post, Lucas asks me a question:

>>That is, does the idea that (for the sake of argument--leaving aside the
never-racially-innocent notion of assumption about the Yasusada author) a
"white male north american" author created a Japanese poet also interact
with your position that the originally selfless becomes invisible? What I
mean is, can Yasusada be treated as a tribute to Japan, can Pound be read as
writing tributes to China, instead of putting these acts of translation in
terms of "yellowface" and "imperialism" and "stereotype"? Is the writer
writing against racism--even if he or she is referring to racist discourse
and, as Rich put it, "participating in racialized discourse"--always going
to be turned somewhat invisible (or more to the point: viewed as
Imperialist) as long as he or she is not from the culture in question?<<

Since, again, I don't know Pound well enough or Yasusada at all (I was, in
fact, going to post to ask someone to explain it to me), I can't answer this
question in precisely the terms that Lucas asks, but here are some things
that occur to me in response, half-assed as they might be:

1. It seems entirely possible to me that Pound was writing, in his own mind,
and given his cultural context, tributes to China, the best that could have
been done at the time. That does not mean that those tributes were not
informed by imperialist or colonialist or racist values.

2. There is a difference between translating and speaking out against racism
or sexism that I think it is important not to elide. Not, Lucas, that I
think you are trying to; I just think this is an important point to make.
The translator always faces the culture he is translating from, unless he or
she is bilingual/bicultural, from what seems to me to be an irreconcilable
position of otherness, and so while the translator might wish, on some
level, to become invisible, that invisibility is always an impossibility. He
or she is, by definition, creating a new text and he or she is its author as
much as the author of the original, along with the original, is, for want of
a better term, its originator. (I don't know if that distinction makes
sense; it's one that just occurred to me now as I was writing.)

Someone speaking out against racism, on the other hand, who is not the
direct object of the racial hatred is not speaking from a similar position
of otherness, because the racist values already exist within him or her, I
would say by definition, simply by virtue of having grown up in a racist
culture. And so that person's invisibility, if it is as I described it in my
earlier post (and I may be wrong), is not the result of the desire to
disappear into the opposition to racism, to be seen only as defending the
people who are the objects of racial hatred, but rather--I think--of a
desire on the part of the people he or she is calling on their racism to be
able to keep themselves distant from their own racism. What do I mean by
that?--and I have to register again my own discomfort at using myself as an
example, or of talking about some third person as if I had not raised the
question about myself. But okay, let's say that white person calls another
white person on  his or her racism. For the second white person really to
acknowledge what the first one said would be to acknowledge on some level
the systemic nature of white privilege, the institutionalized nature of
racism, because the person who is being anti-racist cannot help but also be
expressing, if not saying outright, if he or she is honest, that he or she
has also internalized the racist values that he or she is speaking out
against. In other words, if both of those people take the charge of racism
seriously, the work they do, discussion they have, becomes one of "we are
racist and how can we stop being that way" as opposed to "I am sorry I
offended you [the people who are the object of the racism] and I will try
not to do it anymore," which is a much safer place to be, I think, because
the person who is the object of the racism can "forgive you" and offer you a
kind of absolution in a way that the person who speaks out against racism
cannot.

I do think this is one of the reasons why most people who want to apologize
for the racism in Andrew's poem or otherwise ameliorate the characterization
of the poem as racist have been responding to Tim by name and not to me. If
they can persuade him it is not racist, then that must mean it is not; and
in those terms, only he, not I, can make such a pronouncement. Only he, in
other words, can say, "I no longer feel myself to be the object of the
racism I think/thought is/was expressed here." And if he were to be so
persuaded, it would no longer matter what I thought; his change of mind
would be proof enough that I was wrong.

I'm not entirely sure I have answered your question, Lucas, but this was an
interesting knot to think through.

When is a translation "racist," when is it not? Since, in my view,
translation is only possible through a misreading of a text, every authentic translation
is to some extent exploitative (does that make it necessarily racist?).

That exploitative violence is what Spicer is after in "after Lorca."

Pound was unquestionably "misreading" Chinese texts to bring a previously
absent quality to the English language. Did that quality exist in Chinese poetry
or was it purely a phantasy which Pound used prejudices about China as a prop
to develop ? Only in the latter case can one think of racism?

Also, it seems to me, we are merging two different issues. If I remember
correctly, John Yau's piece appeared in The American Poetry Review in response to
Elliot Weinberger's modernist anthology. E's talk at The Poetry Project on the
occasion of the publication of the same book elicited a very strong negative
response also from Amiri Baraka.

In Eliot's case and in the case of the poem discussed in this thread, the
criticism is against a writer's own words: "why the Taiwanese...,"   etc.

In my view, a poet is always responsible for his or her words, now and ever.

Of course, the distinction between "poet" and "translator" is much more
blurry, ambiguous than I made for rhetorical reason; but that is a blur one should
confront directly.

is using dialect/particular language communities' idiolects racist, classist, imperialist, etc? how about their language? does it matter what the intention or meaning of the poem is? how about use of history? creation myths? old legends? what if i write a poem about lower class folk than me? can this be written so it is not classist?  i've wondered about all of this & wondering if it is possible for anyone to give a straight opinion with these broad examples.

thought i'd give some made up examples...

a reworking of a hindu story -- it seems okay to do greek, or latin, or certain white people stories, but using hte myths of anotehr culture (linked to religion or otherwise) is very...very.. odd.

if i had written li-young lee's "persimmons" poem (assuming that were possible) would that be racist of me, to make such assumptions or assume another race's voice (i am white?) i can't think of another good one at this time.

use of a white person of ebonics, "uncle remus" talk -- even small bits of it --in an intended satirical way, or in order to depict these people. i have NEVER seen this. and yet i feel like people who aren't racist are definately interested in other cultures, other dialects, etc... other religions.

i just want to be careful with everything i write in the future, ya know?

This link is to a book called The Digital Hood, by Peter Rondinone, a white
guy who wrote these stories in "black dialect," or at least his version
thereof. I make no claims for the authenticity of the language or for the
quality of the stories themselves, but it is an attempt to do what Michelle
asks about in her post.

I will confess to being a bit exhausted by this thread, but I'll try
to respond, though I fear fatigue is making my tone increasingly
defensive.

I realize I can't win on the issue of Yau and of Chang et al.  If I
try to distance myself from Yau I am still associated with his point
of view and expected to defend him (or repudiate him); if I express
approval of some of his opinions and those of Chang et al. I am
accused of toeing the party line, assigned the status of "co-writer."

If, as Lucas claims, Yau says that no one should ever read Pound,
then obviously I wouldn't agree with that.  If, as Lucas suggests, he
was settling some kind of political score in a review that I haven't
read then that's none of my affair.  I've tried to explain what *I*
mean by racism and imperialism; perhaps Yau simply uses the words
differently.

I suppose Lucas is right: this really is, and has been all along,
about the politics of race in North America.  Lucas gives us an image
of an America in which political correctness has run amok--that bad
old '80s and '90s world of campus speech codes and racial separatism;
in this world, it would seem, "racist" and "imperialist" are far more
threatening terms of abuse than racial slurs.  In part I think this
perception is due to the odd position of contemporary poetry: often
nourished by the academy (although in constant agony over such
connections) and generally wedded to left politics.  The result is
what I sometimes find to be a rather upside-down view of American
politics: the fact that the academy is hypervigilant about issues of
racism and sexism (though not always with real results) does not mean
that the wider society behaves the same way, or that a charge of
"racism" carries the same weight for a wider audience.  That the
self-flagellation of intellectuals and academics over race
occasionally reaches the level of absurdity doesn't change the fact
that racism and sexism are real-- that white men still earn more
money than anyone else, for example, or that racial minorities
receive far worse health care and education.  So I hardly raise such
issues lightly or without a sense of their political charge.

There is a strong implication by Lucas that nearly any charge of
racism or imperialism is irresponsible and likely to destroy
someone's career and reputation.  I see little evidence that this is
the case; when it is, it's usually not because non-white people have
gained power but because those currently in power are trying to fend
off criticism--cf. Trent Lott's loss of the Senate leadership over
statements perceived to be in support of segregation.  But Lott has
hardly been forced from office or even from a position of significant
power, and other politicians who have made similar statements (e.g.
Rep. Howard Coble, who some months ago pronounced the internment of
Japanese Americans during WWII justified and desirable--a conclusion
long ago discredited by the federal government and the courts) have
suffered no ill effects whatsoever.

In the more immediate case, I see no evidence that Andrew's
reputation on this list has been destroyed by my critiques; after
all, there have been more people rising to his defense than joining
me in my objections.  Nor do I see any evidence that the critique by
Chang et al. of the Yasusada project has destroyed the reputation of
that work; if anything, the controversy has increased the work's
circulation and exposure.

Lucas asks:
<<But if the "real response" should be an inquiry into the motives, then where
does that leave the imperialist critique of Ezra Pound's Chinese
translations? Where does that leave stereotyping in the Yasusada poems?
Where does that leave the racism in Andrew's poem?

The motives of all these acts of poetry seem pretty pure...>>

"Motives," in this case, cannot be reduced to the explicit intentions
of the authors.  I did not base my interpretation of the motives of
"WHY DO THE TIAWANESE" on my personal acquaintance with Andrew, but
on the rhetoric and tone of the work and the way in which it was
framed.  That one can have the best intentions and yet produce work
with all kinds of unintended consequences should surprise no one.  In
this discussion, for example, even if I regard my own motives as
"pure" (whatever that might mean), I find that radically different
motives are being projected onto my arguments, which is just a
testament to the structure of the larger discourse into which they
enter.

Lucas asks:
<<Tone of voice is important. So are associations. Andrew wrote about dogs
being run over, which Timothy assosicated with dogs being eaten. So really,
Timothy, we have to ask: what is the point behind your association?>>

My association was not simply invented, but was based on the fact
that the line "WHY DO THE TAIWANESE / run over dogs like nothing" is
later followed by "WHY DO THE TIAWANESE / prepare meat in the
gutter."  I would call that careful reading and not arbitrary
association.  The point is one I have tried continuously to make:
that these images participate in a larger, negatively valenced
discourse about Asians, whether Andrew intended them to or not.

Finally, Kent Johnson emphasizes the empathetic and sympathetic
elements of the Yasusada project.  That is certainly his prerogative.
But I would still argue that Chang, Lew, Tabios, and Yau's critique
provides a necessary counterpoint.  Since Kent has invited me to go
back and read Yasusada, I would invite him to go back and read my
posts over the past few days.  If he still believes after reading
them that I am merely an ideological hack, intent on blindly
repeating "rituals of conventionalized authorship," then so be it.

I'd like to respond by laying out a scenario I am currently involved in. =
I
am in the process of producing a literary translation of Saadi's "The
Gulistan." To my knowledge, mine will be the first such translation in
English, post-1940, that will encompass selections from the entire work. =
I
speak some and understand a decent amount of conversational Farsi, but I
neither read nor write the language, and I certainly have no command of =
the
language as it existed in the 13th century when Saadi wrote. I am using =
as a
trot Edward Rehatsek's 1880s translation of the entire work, which, I am
given to understand by the people who hired me and by my reading, is
generally recognized as the most accurate English-language translation =
of
the text that we have. In a sense, then, I am translating a 19th century
British English translation that is not literary into 21st century =
literary
American English. (I know I am playing fast and loose with the term =
literary
here, but please bear with me.) I do have a copy of the original text =
and
access to informants, scholarly and otherwise--my wife, who is Iranian, =
is
one--who can read and translate it for me as necessary, but I have
discovered that the Farsi text of the Gulistan that I was given is not =
the
same version that Rehatsek used when he did his translation; there are
passages in the Rehatsek text that are not in the Farsi text that I =
have,
and vice versa. And so not only is my translation going to be a =
misreading
of a misreading, it is a misreading of a text that is a translation of =
an
original that is no longer considered authoritative, that is, in other
words, considered now to be a misreading/misrepresentation of that =
"actual"
original manuscript. So there is a lot of textual and cultural =
exploitation
going on here, but I don=92t think exploitation in and of itself is =
always
bad, if by exploitation we mean to use something for one's own purpose. =
It
depends on what the purpose is, which is part of what Murat's point was =
in
his post, I think.

The organization that hired me to do this translation is the =
International
Society for Iranian Culture, started by a man who is a former cultural
attach=E9 to the Iranian mission to the UN. He is, as far as I know, and =
I
have some pretty authoritative information on this, not at all aligned =
with
the conservative forces in the Iranian government. His goal in starting =
the
organization is to make it possible for cultural interchange between =
Iran
and the US to take place under the political radar, so to speak, and one =
the
ways in which he wants to do this is to produce contemporary, =
accessible,
literary translations of some of the great works of Persian literature,
which are, many of them, foundational works of world literature, in the
sense that they are widely recognized as masterpieces. According to him, =
he
first approached Coleman Barks to do this work, but Barks turned him =
down;
he then approached a man named Dick Davis, who is a poet and is fluent =
in
Farsi, and who has in fact done quite a bit of translating from Farsi =
into
English, but Davis turned him down as well. He found me because a friend =
of
the guy he asked to put some feelers out knows me pretty well. I have no
background in Persian literature, had not even heard of most of the =
works I
have been hired to translate, or their authors, before I agreed to take =
on
this project, but the guy who hired me made clear that he was more
interested in finding a poet/writer who could produce the kind of text =
he
wanted in English than he was in working with someone who is fluent in =
Farsi
or who had, say, the kind of credentials that Barks has. (Though I have =
no
doubt he was disappointed when both Barks and Davis said no.) In any =
event,
he liked the samples that I did for him, and so he hired me to do the =
work.
(Lucas Klein will be posting an excerpt from the translation to
cipherjournal.com, if anyone is interested, and another excerpt will be
appearing in the next issue of Circumference.)

So that is my situation. Now, here is a short sketch of what I have =
learned
about how Saadi and The Gulistan has been situated in Western/European
culture. (My source for much of this information is John D. Yohannan's =
two
books, "The Poet Sa'di: A Persian Humanist" and "Persian Poetry in =
England
and America: A 200 Year History." During the Enlightenment, his text was
used by intellectuals to demonstrate that, in fact, Muslims were not so
different from Christians, a radical departure from the hostility with =
which
Muslims had been viewed prior to that. Jump next to the last quarter of =
the
eighteenth century, when Britain had become so deeply involved in the
governance of India that it was necessary to bring the British East =
Indian
Company under the auspices of the crown. This move made Indian culture =
and
civilization, Yohannan's words, "a practical and direct concern of the
general English public [and] since Persian was the language of the Mogul
courts, it was almost a patriotic duty for Englishmen to cultivate it." =
A
tremendously focused effort to translate works of Persian literature =
into
English ensued, though now the point of the translation--and Saadi's =
work
was used throughout this effort--was to show how different the Indians =
were
from the British and so help British civil servants understand better =
how to
govern them. There was even a bowdlerized Gulistan produced for the use =
of
Christian children.

English and American writers of the 19th century responded with great
enthusiasm to the translations that were produced of Persian literature,
both in their century and the prior one, and Saadi was a huge hit. =
Emerson
called The Gulistan a secular Bible and wrote an introduction to one of =
the
translations of the work; he also wrote a poem about Saadi; Thoreau =
wrote
about Saadi in his journal and found The Gulistan to be highly =
influential;
Byron called Saadi a Persian Catullus.

This is the milieu in which Rehatsek, who was Hungarian, produced his
English translation of The Gulistan and it is, in some sense, the =
lineage of
my own translation.

So now, having gone through all that, this is what I want to say in =
response
to Murat's question, and it may be that I am taking the question in a
direction other than he intended. My own translation is circumscribed by
Rehatsek's in ways I am not even aware of, not only because I cannot =
read
the material and am not even a scholar of this material in English, but
because linguistic and poetic choices are already limited by his biases. =
To
take a pretty obvious example, you lose in Rehatsek's translation all =
the
different verse forms Saadi employed; there is no efficient way for me =
to
reconstruct them, and so I have chosen to render the poetry--the work
combines poetry and prose--into blank verse because, among other =
reasons, it
is the only form in English that I can handle with any facility that =
begins
to approach, to my ear anyway, the kind of solemnity that you hear when
Persians read poetry in Farsi. But there are, I have no doubt, other =
biases
in the Rehatsek version that I am not aware, cultural biases, perhaps =
racial
ones, certainly religious ones--he employs Christian terminology and
references to translate Muslim concepts and images--and I have no doubt =
as
well that his whole translation project was in some way informed by the
British colonial project in India and the interest in things Persian =
that it
spawned. The parallel, in the US anyway, would be the idea now being =
pushed
in Congress by the right that international education at the university
level ought to serve the primary purpose of providing the CIA, the =
military,
the FBI and other government agencies of all stripes with people =
conversant
in other language and cultures so that we, the US government, can =
protect
ourselves from "terrorists," further our interests overseas, and so on. =
Was
Rehatsek any more or less racist/colonialist/whatever than any other =
person
of his time? Who knows, but we would be fooling ourselves, as well as
missing an opportunity to learn something, were we to assume that his =
text
was, because he was not an obvious racist/colonialist (and I don't know =
this
for a fact; like I said, I am no expert in this area), free of the
colonialist influences that he could not have helped but be aware of =
given
when and where he lived.

The same thing, it seems to me, will be true of my own translation. I am
trying very hard as I work, for example, to remove some of the ways in =
which
Rehatsek Europeanizes Saadi's text. So, when possible, I preserve Farsi
names for things and concepts that Rehatsek translated, often awkwardly =
into
English. But I would be fooling myself and my readers, I think, in a =
very
cynical way if I were to suggest that my translation absolutely does not
somehow perpetuate Rehatsek's biases, racial, colonial, cultural or
otherwise. Does that make my translation racist? Not if by racist you =
mean a
work that is intended to erase or otherwise denigrate Persian culture in =
the
interests of furthering my own cultural agenda, but is my translation =
part
of a tradition of translators who were in fact more interested in their =
own
cultural agenda than in the radical act of sympathy/empathy that someone
else in this discussion characterized translation as? Well, yes, and to =
say
otherwise would, I think, be dishonest.

There is a great deal more to say about this subject, and I am certainly =
not
an authority on the politics of translation, since this is the first
translation project I have ever done. So I would be very glad to hear =
what
others have to say about these issues.

And now, it's time for bed.

Kent Johnson also sent me this poem, about (or already) to come out in
Antennae.

Kent asks: "Is this poem racist?"

Lucas




ORIENTALIST HAIBUN
(with Cups of Sake Four)





It is because what we say is unfinished, always, that we can say

without fear. The gatekeepers themselves, in speaking back law, say

only what they have been given to say by signs. It is always

unfinished. Thinking of this I gathered courage, making prostrations.

The land to the East or West of us is there because we are here,

speaking of it. (My sister wrote that.)



Anyway, when I arrived at the first gate, I was told I could not

pass. The guards were dressed in coats of black scales, with

half-moons of gold covering their mouths. They spoke in tongues from

the West and told me to return there. Beyond their head-sets, sparks

flew in the night across the wooden houses, and I imagined that those

of the foreign community inside were shimmering and transparent

so that their bones mingled as one with the tea-fires and the frozen

flight of the cranes. (Awkward, but I am writing quickly here.) And

then, by magic, Mack, the Western Guards became tethered to long and

shiny poles of discourse (though it was dark and I couldn't quite

see) and were spun round and round so that a breeze lightly scented

with bream and salt cooled my face. I smashed the turtle's shell and

passed boldly through the gate.



You see, it was the thought of Witter Bynner that led me on. I

desired my dust to be mingled with his, forever and forever and

forever. I also thought of the following things, though I would never

dare to speak them openly:



The State of Hand Not Joined to Body

The State of Being Perfectly Not Here

The State of Disconsolate Thought of Wings

The State of Myouka Writing "Hand Not Joined to Body"

The State of Rose of the Snow Kimono

The State of Poem Written on Throat of Turtle

The State of Shikantaza as Loving Cunt Enfolding

The State of Kissing Son on Loving Lips

The State of Sons as Suicidal Aviators Exultant

The State of Being a Staff or Whisk

The State of Stillness in Self-Fulfilling Samadhi

The State Where the Moon Swallowing Is Brought Forth



Weary, I took a piss, making great steam in the Autumn grasses. Then,

preparing ink on a large stone, I wrote:



[xx] shungyo ya hito koso shirane kigi-no ame [xx]

Which I choose to translate thus:

[mourning his son he crosses the hills with a large sack of eggs]



When I arrived at the second gate, Chuck, it was May, and all was in the

State of Three Heads and Eight Arms as Rain on the Trees. The guard

of this gate had the corpulent face and body of Amida, but I knew

that was just a disguise. He spoke in hoarse whispers and in a

language I could only understand by imagining. He told me to display

wares in my lacquer-bone-poet-box, and I did so. He told me to

ornately describe the Eastern Suburbs with their alleys full of

squatting whores and peddlers, and I did this. He told me to squat

thusly and shit in my beggar's hat and I did so. He told me to write

one wonder-haiku on cicada husk's soundless cry, and I did this, his

sword suspended in threat above.  I wrote:



Towa x ni x ikitashi x onna-no x koe x to x semi-no x ne x to
Which I choose to translate thus:

[my soul passes through those of others: hydragena exhibit]



Thus, this apparition vanished, and I went deeper into the mandala,

having no idea where I was headed (and admittedly half-wishing I had

heeded the cautionary advice of my grad school advisors).  Wide-eyed,

I witnessed:



The Room of Looking through a Bamboo Tube

The Room of Scholars Who Count Letters

The Room of Poets with Strings of Law Leading Back to Their Names

The Room of the Theory of Five Ranks

The Room of Mud Within Mud

The Room of Merely Being "In the Mountains"

The Room of Oneness Within Differentiation

The Room of Udumbara in Shameless Flower

The Room of "Life Streams Issue from Plum Blossoms"

The Room of Everyday Rice-Eating Activity

The Room of Sky with Palms Together

The Room of Mind Moon Alone and Full



I felt fear and trembling, I felt the insistent repetition of all

phenomenal things, I felt an anxiety and dread of concepts that

verged (is it possible to say it?) on the irony of Being itself, and

I felt a sickness unto death. You see, Dick, I had come to

the gate through which the masts of Foreign Ships are visible! It was

like a forest after a great fire, or a city of people who have been

burned to a crust but are still standing. And I realized that this

was the Room of No Turning Back.



The guard here was dressed in elegant suit. He both was and was not

(if you can imagine that!), like the brittle sumi-e I had seen at

Eihei-ji: a single Not-Thinking stroke bringing sudden form out of

no-form. He appeared to me as an American executive from Toshiba, and

he brandished a scroll of unfair treaties, all inscribed in the most

delicate calligraphy. He said I could pass only should I beat him in

Poetry-Duel-to-Death. "I go first," he growled, "and my poem is

titled 'State of Siege.'" He read in rapid-fire bursts, his voice

screeching as ten-thousand shikirichi, and through the great roar of

rushing waters' sound, this is what I heard:



shaving dace [...] now stomping [.........]

town wall [....] place for gossip or [...]

[.......]daughter's dream--silkworm dealers?[.......]but[..]

But [......]market flooded. Why Pentium Chips if

geisha expert [...] quick web-search for [..........]

thirty seven Mexicans suffocated in freight car clawing eyes out

[...............................................................]



I was fearful and trembled at his fierce visage. A device for

measuring time glowed with Oriental splendour on his wrist. Sparks

flew in the night across the great wooden ships beyond. I knew now

the foreigners had been waiting there, Jack, shimmering and transparent,

for thousands and thousands of Springs. I dipped my brush and raised

it slowly back, knowing death-poem in my bones, knowing the darkness

there in the glistening point of it... And I wrote:



xHyakuxxxsen-noxxxdokanxxitsumademoxxxxwarauxxxkareno-nox

Which is untranslatable thus:

[                                                                  ]





                                    ---------------------------



And when I woke, drenched from the dream, it was my teacher, serene

in Electric State of Coming Wonders, speaking to us in measured and

instructional tones. And this is what I heard:



"This paradox cannot be mediated, for it depends specifically on

this: In attachment blossoms fall, and in aversion weeds spread. The

single individual is only the single individual. As [inaudible] as

this single individual wants to express his absolute duty in the

universal, becomes conscious of it in the universal, he recognizes

that he is involved in a spiritual trial. [extended inaudible

section] Do not be limited to the narrow views held by human beings.

Even where there is no sun and moon, there is day and night."

(I taped that.)



He was a monk from Japan. He was vegetarian and ate his rice and

things with chopsticks, Kent. And I spoke every Orientalist dream that

came to me that sesshin, into the black hole of his succulent, papery

ear.

LEA Special Issue: New Media Poetry and Poetics
Guest Editor: Tim Peterson (tscotpeterson@hotmail.com)

The Leonardo Electronic Almanac (ISSN No: 1071-4391) is inviting papers and
artworks that deal with New Media Poetry and Poetics. This category
includes multimedia digital works (image/text/sound) as examined through the
lens of "writing," specifically any of those concerns central to poetry
rather than
narrative or prose: reader as active participant in the "ergodic" sense, the
use of
chance or automatism inherited from movements such as Oulipo (highlighting
the
literalized metaphor which automatism becomes here), and the complex
relations
between the author, reader, and computer-as-writer/reader which evolve from
that interaction. Any work that foregrounds the medium as such ("codework"
or
related modes, for example) is also welcome. We would particularly like to
emphasize the "poetics" of new media writing as well, that is, the point
where
aesthetics intersects with politics to create dynamic attempts at social
change.

LEA encourages international artists / academics / researchers / students to
submit their proposals for consideration. We particularly encourage authors
outside North America and Europe to send proposals for
articles/gallery/artists
statements.

Proposals should include:
-       300 word abstract / synopsis
-       A brief author biography
-       Any related URLs
-       Contact details

Deadline for proposals: 15 Aug 2004

Please send proposals or queries to:
Tim Peterson

Walking Theory #51

What are the limits of language?

=B3No matter how much you write

you will never understand the black man.=B2

1964, there I stood, notebook in hand,

corner of McCallister & Fillmore:

Stripped bare by the observed.

******
I suspect at the root of many of these issues is the one of manipulation.
How much more does an artist/poet get from the subject of his desire when h=
e
or she asks for permission. What if Andrew in Taiwan raised his issues
directly with the Taiwanese and made the poem/the work situation a
collaborative one? In the way now that most photographers ask a person for
permission before taking their photograph. In what ways does the "subject"
open - or maybe become a partner in the process of creating the content -
that is different than the artist as voyeurist, the thief with the quick
eye, the thrill of penetrating and  apprehending the object and going home
to make art or poetry with it? Or conversely - as is so often true in the
media biz - how might the subjects of the art manipulate (edit) the mode an=
d
content of the observer.

Is there such a thing as an accurate epiphany in which the art work rises
(burns)  above the claims(including racial prejudices) of both artist and
subject into something independent, something either called true or
authentic and open to whatever interpretation any member of the public migh=
t
want to bring to it.???

Where or how does one distinguish between 'art' and 'real estate" issues?
Does anyone - finally - own "it"?

The poet as "linguistic judge and executioner" - how to say good-bye to all
of that - Isn't that at the source of the anger, resentment and challenge
here?
(Let along the linguistic purveyors in the White House, Pentagon - "Enemy
Combatants", etc., etc.)

Briefly on Kent Johnson's poem - which I can't say (or say why) I ended up
not wanting to read closely:  In terms of contemporary "Asia" looking at
itself, I recommend the most recent issue of Art in America which has some
terrific images (among many kinds) of contemporary Chinese artists
re-visiting, satirizing and variously turning upside down "Orientalist"
and/or traditional motif(s). Talk about energy and having a great time
shaking up the past! Wonderful stuff.

But I think in many cases that's exactly the subtext of what a lot of this
kind of criticism does. Not always, of course--some critics are particularly
deft--but usually I think a paper on, say, anti-semitism in Eliot or slavery
in Dickens comes with an often unmentioned attitude of: look how much better
we are than these people! I hate to sound like Harold Bloom, and depending
on the focus I do indeed see the value of this kind of criticism. But as we
all know, there's a lot of criticism, and the best is usually buried under a
lot of pounds of paper.

This is a good point to follow when writing today, but I guess in the end
I'm still not completely sold on ideological and historical readings. May be
as simple as that.

Well put.

what's interesting is that the translations of Asian poetry that were
popular before and after Pound's Cathay were, for the most part (Arthur
Waley's astounding versions aside) full of Chinoiserie and Japonoiserie, or
translations in the language of geisha girls and fortune-cookie monks (this
may be anachronistic; I don't know when fortune cookies first appeared). It
was this kind of imperialist prejudice--they're so different! they're so
mystical!--that Pound was reacting against. He was the first translator into
English who allowed the Chinese to speak plainly, the way we do. In John
Yau's argument (sorry to bring this up again) this proves his
imperialism--call it takeism--because the imperialists went out and
conquered and brought back whatever they wanted. So while a certain kind of
imperialism may have gone unexamined, embedding it even further into the
cultural view of China, it was simultaneously an embodiment of its own
examination of imperialism, trying to dislodge it from English language and
literature.

I can see this. But I'm still wary of the accusatory tone of much of this
kind of criticism.

okay. Again, I think we have to deal with the sticky issue of the author:
how much credit do we give it, and to what ends? (this is probably not a
question to be answered now).

your point is a good one. I was, however, consciously using your question
for different ends in asking if the translator--even or especially when
trying to counteract racism (I believe that almost any act of translation is
an act towards world peace)--is always open to attacks such as these.

A good point, and a call for serious introspection!

exploitative is probably not necessarily racist, but they're damn similar,
aren't they?

So I wonder how this interacts with my belief that translation is an act
towards world peace. I mean, it's a pretty grand sentiment, but if we all
read the Qu'uran we're be more inclined to understand Islamic viewpoints,
wouldn't we? When I was growing up I knew my great-grandmother was Russian
and therefore Russia could not be the Evil Empire (nevermind that she was a
White Russian who fled the communists--this was a subtlety lost on me then);
I'm sure I would have had a similar view if I had read Tolstoy at an age
where I couldn't distinguish between different political regimes. Okay, that
seems particularly unlikely. But nonetheless I endorse the political
possibilities of the internationalism that translation both inspires and
requires.

Which is not to say that I disagree about translation requiring a
misreading.

Pound's translations from the Chinese--for all his liberties, for all his
howlers--made possible a literalism previously unimaginable. Because he
"broke the pentameter" and disgarded the rhyme scheme, he was able to follow
the grammar and pace of the Chinese poetic line. This hadn't been done
before, and was done afterwards with greater success because of translators
who at once followed Pound's model and also knew the language better. And
that's what Eliot meant when he called Pound "the inventor of Chinese poetry
for our time". He saw then that people would follow him. It's hard for me to
see this as racist, because it was a movement against an earlier
prescription of how to translate Chinese poetry.

On the other hand, translations of classical Chinese poetry into English by
Chinese writers (I do not count Wai-lim Yip, Yun Huangte, or most other
Western academics raised in China) do indeed read as if they were done in
1840. I find them unreadable, heavy-stomping and contrived, full of
misreadings and textual violations. But it's hard--damned near
impossible--to call them racist.

Baraka's negative response to Weinberger was unrelated, and had little to do
with race, more to do with revolution. Quite the contrary, inclusion of
Baraka in the anthology was one of the pegs on which Yau managed to hang his
accusation of Weinberger's racism (he said that he could only handle the
image of the angry black man, so his anthology included only two black
men--Baraka and Langston Hughes--both ranting). Oh, there's so much of Yau's
article that deserved to be laughed out of court.

> In my view, a poet is always responsible for his or her words, now and
ever.

this is the clearest and closest we've come to taking a stake in authorship
so far!

I have caveats and disagreements, but that's for a different thread.

exactly. For instance, what about a translator's responsibility for his
words?

Michelle:

your questions are too broad for me to wrap my brain around at this hour
(1:16 in Beijing), but I will say this:

> a reworking of a hindu story -- it seems okay to do greek, or latin, or
certain white people stories, but using hte myths of anotehr culture (linked
to religion or otherwise) is very...very.. odd.

I'd love to read it, and if you write one, please submit it to
www.CipherJournal.com.

> use of a white person of ebonics, "uncle remus" talk -- even small bits of
it --in an intended satirical way, or in order to depict these people. i
have NEVER seen this. and yet i feel like people who aren't racist are
definately interested in other cultures, other dialects, etc... other
religions.

Unless I'm mistaken, "Uncle Remus" was written by a white man. Yes no?

I mean, Faulkner might be another example, but as racism in him is hardly
what we can call admirable (W. E. B. Du Bois challenged him to a debate on
segregation--he declined), I think he might be best left alone. Although,
some of Faulkner's black characters are the most interesting he wrote.


Rich, again:

>>>>
I'd like to respond by laying out a scenario I am currently involved in.
<<<<

Your method of translation is pretty much the same as Kenneth Rexroth's
method of translating Japanese and Chinese. Reworking earlier English
versions, cribs, and so on, with a small but important knowledge of the
language and a native informant or two as well. This method may be even more
idealistic than a general translator's, who comes from a knowledge of the
original before (usually) deciding to transmit that knowledge into another
language.

>>>
English and American writers of the 19th century responded with great
enthusiasm to the translations that were produced of Persian literature,
both in their century and the prior one, and Saadi was a huge hit. Emerson
called The Gulistan a secular Bible and wrote an introduction to one of the
translations of the work; he also wrote a poem about Saadi; Thoreau wrote
about Saadi in his journal and found The Gulistan to be highly influential;
Byron called Saadi a Persian Catullus.
<<<<

this is a true testament to the power of translation! I don't care about the
imperialist history of finding a translator for Persian literature as much
as I care about other minds being able to access--even if just a little
bit--part of the depths of another culture.

>>>
But I would be fooling myself and my readers, I think, in a very
cynical way if I were to suggest that my translation absolutely does not
somehow perpetuate Rehatsek's biases, racial, colonial, cultural or
otherwise. Does that make my translation racist? Not if by racist you mean a
work that is intended to erase or otherwise denigrate Persian culture in the
interests of furthering my own cultural agenda, but is my translation part
of a tradition of translators who were in fact more interested in their own
cultural agenda than in the radical act of sympathy/empathy that someone
else in this discussion characterized translation as? Well, yes, and to say
otherwise would, I think, be dishonest.
<<<<

but Rich, don't you think that you're placing a grand assumption on
Rehatsek's person by noting his biases? I'd never heard of him before you
alerted me, but isn't it possible that he, like you, took on this task of
translation for any number of reasons, and that perhaps, like you, racial,
colonial, cultural, and other biases were unimportant? Granted, you have his
language, his force-fitting of Muslim into Christian terminology, his
lawnmowering of verse forms, and so on. But perhaps the ends justify the
means: his work inspired Thoreau. And I think that is as much part of the
heritage of your translation as anything else.

And maybe I'm naive. But I'm such a cynic in so many other ways, can't I
have this one?

Also, for those of you who can get there, an astonishing show of young
Chinese photographers, very urban, very non-"orientalist," up now at the
Centro Cultural in Tijuana. Another reason to cross the border.

Richard,

Thank you for your very thoughtful response. That a translation satisfies a=20
need in the host language (or culture), to me, is indubitable. A translator=20
should acknowledge that. Even the cultural attache who commissioned you is "=
more=20
interested in finding a poet/writer who could produce the kind of text he=20
(italics my own) wanted in English than he was in working with someone who i=
s=20
fluent in Farsi."

Important translations, such as The King James Bible or Chaucer's major poem=
s=20
or Pound's The Seafarer, are integral to the social, political and poetic=20
arguments of their time. It is interesting to compare what King James's vers=
ion=20
finally retains and what discards (misreads) from the Lutheran version, whic=
h=20
is itself based on an earlier Greek text. Rehatsek's Sadi translations, I=20
suppose, belong to the political climate and purposes of 19th century Englan=
d.

My own "Eda: An Anthology Of Contemporary Turkish Poetry" is, from one angle=
,=20
a poetic manifesto for a new kind of poetry in American poetry. On the other=
=20
hand, I am asked by a Lebanese newspaper (Daily Star) to write an essay on=20
contemporary Turkish poetry -using the writing of the anthology as a basis-=20=
to=20
discuss Turkey's place in contemporary Middle East. Is Turkey an Asiatic=20
(Islamic) or a European country, a question looming around the war in Iraq a=
nd about=20
which Turkish poetry and the antholgy have a lot say, particularly as=20
subtexts.=20

The best translations are always polemical trying to change (misread?) their=
=20
times. In that sense chains of translations constitute a single text (what=20
Benjamin calls ideal language), a continuum.

Where is the "original" language in all that, Hebrew, Aramaic, Persian,=20
Turkish, Chinese? An elusive there. But, as in photography, this thereness i=
s=20
essential. One can misread it, distort it, fragment it; but that contact is=20=
the=20
source of all energy.

There is one issue I am uncomfortable about: not knowing=20

Once, again, thanks to all who contributed to the summer gallery.  I've
already received more good work than I can use.  Look for the announcement re:  the
Fall gallery sometime in October.

The latest Blackbox is now online.  Go to WilliamJamesAustin.com, then follow
the Blackbox link.  Then "scroll" through the galleries until you reach the
summer installment.  Of course there is nothing to stop your enjoying the other

I used to stop into a live forum chat a few years back and met and got to
know a bit a woman who (back channel) revealed to me that she was also a
writer and was Anais Nin's neice.

D.H.Lawrence knew my grandmother - you can check this out - there's a Mrs
Bircumshaw in one of his short stories. I also used to be friends with Sean
O' Casey's granddaughter and went to her wedding in Hackney in 1988 or 89
and met O'Casey's widow.

LEA Special Issue: New Media Poetry and Poetics

Guest Editor: Tim Peterson (tscotpeterson@hotmail.com)

The Leonardo Electronic Almanac (ISSN No: 1071-4391) is inviting papers and
artworks that deal with New Media Poetry and Poetics. This category includes
multimedia digital works(image/text/sound) as examined through the lens of
"writing," specifically any of those concerns central to poetry rather than
narrative or prose: reader as active participant in the "ergodic" sense, the
use of chance or automatism inherited from movements such as Oulipo
(highlighting the literalized metaphor which automatism becomes here), and the
complex relations between the author, reader, and computer-as-writer/reader
which evolve from that interaction. Modes of work that foreground the digital
medium (such as "codework") are also welcome. We would particularly like to
emphasize the "poetics" of new media writing as well, that is, the point where
aesthetics intersects with politics to create dynamic attempts at social
change.

LEA encourages international artists / academics / researchers / students to
submit their proposals for consideration. We particularly encourage authors
outside North America and Europe to send proposals for articles/gallery/artists
statements.

Proposals should include:
-       300 word abstract / synopsis
-       A brief author biography
-       Any related URLs
-       Contact details

Deadline for proposals: 15 Aug 2004

Please send proposals or queries to:

[this was meant to go ahead of the response I posted earlier, with replies
to Rich, Murat, and Michelle. I split the email into two for manageable
length, but the emailer only delivered the second one]


Timothy:

I think you're right, fatigue is making you sound more & more defensive. I
don't disagree with almost anything you say in this post, though, except
that it might do us all some good to look back at some of the things you
wrote in your first response to Andrew's poem:

>>>>
Must we really do this again?

Is it not possible for you to express yourself without leaning on
some kind of Asian stereotype?
<<<<

and

>>>>
Again, I have to say I'm disappointed with the extent to which
remarks like these go unchallenged on this list.  Perhaps it's
because American poets have a long history of not only thinking they
know the Orient but thinking they can somehow channel it, with not a
whole lot of awareness of their own cultural and historical position.
<<<<

I think you've gotten both calmer and more subtle in the posts since that
first one, and your mind seems to have changed about some things. I don't
fault you for this; I think (I hope) my mind has changed about a lot of
these things, too. That's one of the points of these discussions.

But if you feel that people have put you in a corner where you feel you're
being forced to defend being an "ideological hack" or not write about other
cultures, then perhaps it's because your initial posts were much more
forceful than your expressions right now.

As for some of the points you made in this most recent post, I have a couple
of minor things to add.

> I realize I can't win on the issue of Yau and of Chang et al.  If I
> try to distance myself from Yau I am still associated with his point
> of view and expected to defend him (or repudiate him); if I express
> approval of some of his opinions and those of Chang et al. I am
> accused of toeing the party line, assigned the status of "co-writer."

I certainly don't mean to do this to you, and if my bringing up Yau's
article did this to you, then I'm sorry I brought it up. I mentioned it as
an example of the kind of ways in which "awareness of [American poets']
cultural and historical position" can be used to harmful ends. I don't ask
you to defend Yau's position--I don't ask anyone to do that--and the fact
that both you and he are Asian American is really only slightly more than
tangential to this conversation (however, I do believe that many Asian
Americans, wittingly or not, seem to be playing both sides of the street:
you do this yourself when you cast doubt on the ability of white Americans
to "channel" "the Orient" in the same conversation as you say that you are
but an "attenuated representative"; one voice, as I hear it, speaks
authoritatively while the other says 'leave me alone'. Please correct me if
I'm wrong or am otherwise out of bounds). At bottom, the fact that you and
John Yau or anyone else are both Asian American should make you no more or
less likely to agree on anything than, say, Chris Rock and Colin Powell.

well, I'm not doing that purposefully, but all right. I see what you mean.

very true indeed. I sincerely hope that no one doubts my firm belief that
racism and prejudice are serious issues. But at the same time, I do not see
how sensitivity to, say, imperialism as played out in Victorian writing or
stereotypes of Asian culture in an amateur poem do anything to improve
economic and social equality between the races. I guess every step away from
racism is a step in the right direction, but I also think this kind of
sensitivity-training, as it were, is energy misspent.

> There is a strong implication by Lucas that nearly any charge of

again, I'm not consciously saying "any charge of racism" is irresponsible or
destructive. Within certain contexts, however, I think such charges can
either be very destructive or not destructive enough.

I only wish the reactions against Lott and Coble were more destructive. And
this is not only because I disagree with them politically, but also because
as people in positions of authority I think their racist language and racist
thinking are all the more harmful to those of us under their care.

I'm confused. Please explain further.

true. But isn't consideration of "motives" based on the author? I guess,
Timothy, I'm unclear about the extent to which you rely on the author as a
stable figure in literary production, reading, and interpretation.

I see what you mean (finally!). I did not read those lines that way--the
poem was organized pretty randomly the way I read it, so no associations
between dogs and eating showed up--and if I had, I think I'd be more
pre-disposed to say yes, these images participate in a larger, negative
discourse about Asians. As it is, I saw his poem as one of honest reactions
to Asian culture. Complaints, yes, but honest complaints. Some of the
complaints are unfair, as the poem leaves little space for anyone to answer
them, but because of this I could focus less on the "extended discourse" you
talk about.

This does not, by the way, mean that I am staking an opinion on whether
racism is or is not honest. I'd rather not get into that nature or nurture
question!

Well, I don't want to speak for Kent any more than you want to speak for
John Yau!

But I am serious about being confused about your position vis-a-vis the
author. Your first post very clearly states a confusion about Andrew's
political provocativeness by relating his earlier questions to his poetry,
and you suggest that Pound, as an example, should not be expected to
overcome the biases and practices and historical reality of his time. On top
of that, you're noticeably uncomfortable about the authorlessness of
Yasusada, as your assertion that it was written by a white American man
(Kent Johnson?) makes clear. If this is the case, then that's fine, and our
debate is really about how dead the author is (of course, I have conflicting
beliefs about that, too. I've been trying to work them out on my own for no
short time. So I don't expect you or anyone else to be fully consistent on
this or any matter) (and if I can throw another parenthetical in here, I'll
also add that the place of the author is completely relevant to questions of
race/racism in literature: if the author is dead, there's no stable target
for such accusations or readings).

But on the other hand, you remind me of my own readings of Barthes and Fish,
and you remind me that there can be no clear distinction between what's "in"
the text and what's "read into" it. You also say that "motives" of the
question of dog-eating are not based on the author's own, and that
politicians' apologies for racist remarks are not to be accepted easily. So
really, out of the parenthetical, what are your views on authorship?

If you're tired of responding in public-debate form on the thread, please
backchannel me. I'd really appreciate that.

One more request, Timothy: a while ago you mentioned a publication of yours
about "How to Write a Chinese Poem". My webserver in Beijing doesn't seem to
want to let me on to that link. Do you think you could backchannel me a copy
of the text? I'd be much obliged.

I have, actually, a lot that I would like to say in response to the last few
posts in this thread; they raise, all of them, interesting issues, but I am
going, first, to respond to some of the things that Lucas has said in this
most recent post, at least in terms of the order in which it appeared on the
list. Lucas offers a reading of how Tim's tone/voice/position changed over
the course of his (Tim's) participation in this conversation, and he (Lucas)
suggests that Tim's statements about being tired and defensive and in a
no-win position vis a vis the conversation as a whole has at least as much
to do with what Lucas appears to read as the strident accusatory tone of
Tim's original posts as it does with the racism Tim perceived himself as
responding to. I should be clear that I am not trying to put words in Tim's
mouth, or Lucas' for that matter, but this question of how one perceives a
charge/characterization of racism is an important one. So, to start, Lucas
quotes from Tim's initial response to Andrew's poems:


"Must we really do this again? Is it not possible for you to express
yourself without leaning on some kind of Asian stereotype?.Again, I have to
say I'm disappointed with the extent to which remarks like these go
unchallenged on this list.  Perhaps it's because American poets have a long
history of not only thinking they know the Orient but thinking they can
somehow channel it, with not a whole lot of awareness of their own cultural
and historical position."

Lucas then goes on to say:

"I think you've gotten both calmer and more subtle in the posts since that
first one, and your mind seems to have changed about some things. I don't
fault you for this; I think (I hope) my mind has changed about a lot of
these things, too. That's one of the points of these discussions.

But if you feel that people have put you in a corner where you feel you're
being forced to defend being an "ideological hack" or not write about other
cultures, then perhaps it's because your initial posts were much more
forceful than your expressions right now."

I think it's important to remember that Tim was responding to Andrew in the
context of an earlier post of Andrew's to this list, something in which he
used an expression like "Filipino crack whores" and perhaps other similar
epithets directed at Asians as well, and I think at that time--I will
confess to not remembering it that clearly since that earlier conversation
took place around the time I signed on to the list, and so I don't have the
whole thing here on my computer--Tim raised many of the same issues he
raised this time, and I think Andrew took a similar position to the one he
took this time around as well, arguing that it was okay to say pretty much
whatever he wanted for the purposes of provocation while at the same time
trying very hard not to take responsibility for the fact that he had written
what he had written. My point here is not to reopen that argument but rather
to assert that Tim's anger, in that context, is understandable and should be
valued. There is no reason for someone who is Asian or Asian-American to
temper their anger in the fact of those kinds of statements/stereotypes--and
it is important to remember here that no one knew that Andrew's "Tiawanese"
poem was written in response to his experience of living in Taiwan until he
himself provided that information. There was, in other words, until Andrew
said the more that he had to say, no way to read the poem as anything other
than a disembodied diatribe against the Taiwanese and, to the degree that
the voice was disembodied, all other east Asians as well. Again, in the face
of that kind of diatribe, in the context of Andrew's earlier posts, Tim's
anger is not something that should be dismissed as an artifact of an
ideological or historical reading what Andrew wrote.

That Tim connected his anger to a larger concern about how American poets
position themselves relative to Asia is also, it seems to me,
understandable, but it is more than that; it seems to me a way of taking
Andrew seriously as a writer--and the rest of us on this list too--because
it asks Andrew, asks us, to consider our own responsibility for the words we
use, in poems and otherwise. Had Tim gone no further than his initial
question--Must we do this again?--I think Lucas's reading of Tim would make
more sense and be more fair, because that question would have left things on
a personal level, i.e., Andrew is employing Asian stereotypes; Tim is angry;
Tim expresses his anger at Andrew, calls Andrew a racist--which, by the way,
I don't think Tim ever actually did (though I may be wrong); I think Tim was
always very careful to keep his responses limited to responses to Andrew's
language--and allows that characterization to end discussion. Instead, Tim
raises the stakes of the question by posing it in terms of a writer's and an
audience's responsibility for the language that is used in the community
they share. (And I will say it again, there is no reason for him to
apologize for his anger, nor, I think, should those of us who are not
Asian-American take him in any way to task for it; we are, in this
conversation, the ones whose privilege allows us, if we want, to discuss
this in a disinterested and intellectual tone; Tim does not, in this
context, have that luxury. Were we talking about anti-semitism, I might very
well express the same kind of anger that Tim has in this discussion.)

It is true that Tim's tone changed as the discussion progressed--though I
would not argue that he was any less angry, which if course could be my own
misreading of his posts--but that change in tone was, first and foremost, in
response to Andrew's statements which offered context--personal, historical,
intellectual, poetic, analytical, etc.--for the poem. When Andrew did that,
it became possible to have a discussion about whether the poem
succeeded--Tim and I clearly believe it did not--and it became possible to
have the discussion which we are still having now in one way or another,
about whether, given the context Andrew laid out for us, the poem could be
understood, as Lucas has suggested it can be, as a series of understandable
complaints by a westerner living in Taiwan. (I know I am being reductive of
Lucas' reading of the poem here, but my point is less about the complexity
of his reading than it is about the fact that his reading depends on knowing
that Andrew lives and works in Taiwan.)

Later in his post, Lucas says:

"I sincerely hope that no one doubts my firm belief that
racism and prejudice are serious issues."

And I want to acknowledge here a nuance in Lucas' posts, that while he may
have serious questions about the label of racism/imperialism/etc. is used in
literary criticism, he has consistently been willing to admit when aspects
of this discussion have forced him to reflect on the dynamics of racism as a
cultural and political, and not merely personal force, and on how that
dynamic impinges on his life.

Then Lucas says:

"But at the same time, I do not see how sensitivity to, say, imperialism as
played out in Victorian writing or stereotypes of Asian culture in an
amateur poem do anything to improve economic and social equality between the
races. I guess every step away from racism is a step in the right direction,
but I also think this kind of sensitivity-training, as it were, is energy
misspent."

There is a long answer to this question that is, in fact, a whole other
discussion, but I would say this: racism is not only a series of behaviors
directed against a particular group of people. It is also a rhetoric that is
embedded in the language we use. Sexist language provides a good example
from another area: think about the difference between saying "mailman" and
"mail carrier" to refer to the person who delivers your mail. The way these
different words shape our thinking--or, in the case of those of us who grew
up saying mailman and for whom mail carrier may still take a conscious
effort, the thinking of our children versus our thinking--may be very, very
subtle, but I would argue two things about the energy spent in what Lucas
calls "this kind of sensitivity training." First, that energy means an awful
lot to the people about whom "we"--those who need sensitizing--are being
sensitized and to suggest that this energy is misspent is to stake out a
position of privilege vis a vis that other group (women, in the case of my
"mail carrier" example). So, in other words, those of us who are not the
objects of racial hatred can afford not to worry about the specifics of
racist language, especially when there are bigger political anti-racist fish
to fry. Second, to the degree that racism is a rhetoric embedded in our
language/culture, changing that rhetoric in both the public forum of, say,
political speech and in the private forum of how we talk to each other and
think to ourselves about "The Racial Other" is a project those of us who
work against racism should be involved in. To suggest that Andrew ought to
take responsibility for the Asian stereotypes he uses in his amateur poem is
part of both sides of this project, since it asks him to think both about
how his words play out publicly and to examine where those words come from
within himself.

Lucas then expresses confusion in response to the following, quoted from
Tim's post:

"Lucas asks: 'But if the "real response" should be an inquiry into the
motives, then where > does that leave the imperialist critique of Ezra
Pound's Chinese > translations? Where does that leave stereotyping in the
Yasusada poems? > Where does that leave the racism in Andrew's poem? The
motives of all these acts of poetry seem pretty pure...'

'Motives,' in this case, cannot be reduced to the explicit intentions of the
authors."

I think "motives" is the wrong word here, which is why Tim put it in quotes.
We have all had the experience, no doubt, of saying something to someone
that we thought was at worst harmless or innocuous and at best helpful and
important and then having that person respond as if we had said something
insulting or degrading or critical in negative way, or whatever. The fact is
that what we say or write, once we say it or write it, enters not only a
stream of discourse (in my example, the entire history of the discussions,
arguments, etc. that you have had with the person you are talking to) but
also a complex web of interpretive strategies that we cannot control (in my
example, the different ways in which you and that other person have
understood those discussions/arguments and how your separate understandings
are rooted in the specifics of your individual histories). This same dynamic
exists at the cultural level, which is why, in terms of whether Andrew's
poem, not Andrew, is racist, it does not matter on one level what Andrew's
motives were; his language, once he posted the poem, entered this dynamic I
have just described, and just as, when you argue with someone, you need to
take responsibility for the ways in which what you say may have
unintentionally hurt them, and so change the way you say what you say--and
isn't achieving this awareness the kind of thing that goes on, say, in
couples counseling?--so, it is not dismissive of Andrew to ask him to take
responsibility for the way he said what he said, which is really all that
Tim and I were insisting that he needed to do, within the poem, to move the
poem in the direction he said he wanted it to go in his [Andrew's]
subsequent posts. I should also add that I am not suggesting racism can be
reduced to something that belongs on the analyst's couch, so to speak;
clearly it is not. I am just trying to illustrate the dynamic whereby what
one says, however "purely" motivated, can escape one's own intentions once
it enters a public forum.

Not really. The exploitation I am referring to is of language. The racism
discussed in this thread is towards people. A text in another language can be
exloited for many reasons, one of which may be racism, that is to say, implying
its inferiority. The other language can also be seen as superior, possessing a
quality the host language does not possess. Pound's translations, particularly
"The Seafarer" and a few from the Chinese are of this kind. I believe that
Pound's Chinese translations in Cathay (particularly "A Merchant's Letter") are
attempts to bring Dante's visual clarity into English, which he could not
directly do. He had to decouple that clarity from its Christian content, which
exists in Dante. Hence, the attraction of Chinese poetry: a godless Dante.

I completely agree with you about the antidotal effect of translations
against the demonization of the other. This does not mean that we do not distort the
other. An ideal translation creates an alien familiarity, pulling the other
into i, and the i into the other.

Yes. What Pound is "inventing" is writing a new way in English (maybe a poem
as well written as prose).

When you say "textual violations," do you mean in Chinese?

Hiro Sato told me that the idea that haikus are written in three lines is a
fiction. A haiku exists in one single line. I read some of his haiklu
translations years ago. They had a different kind of energy, undercutting a lot of
American assumptions about haiku and the ethos it represents.

These are not issues of racism but part of the history of literary
sensibility.

I suppose I am, but with two distinctions. Authorship is not ownership.
Second, this idea does not imply that the poetic "i" has a defined identity. I only
mean that reading a poem I always assume that the poet chose the words he or
she used, not a data base, not a computer, not dreams, not a system. That
choice has a moral dimension -in that way, words are acts of freedom.

The responsibility is the same as a poet's, at least in my view of both.

Infinite Loop, a New Novel1 by David Foster Wallace2

In the first chapter, the king dies and the queen dies of grief.3

In the second chapter, a flashback, we see the court jester
pouring poison into the king?s goblet.4

In chapter three, a peasant army, loyal
to their beloved regicided royals,5
mount horses, storm the jester?s castle walls.
They don?t have cannons; they fling tennis balls.6

In chapter four, the embattled jester king, while attending mass,
orders scores of beheadings.  ?Mass beheadings,? calls the town crier,
whose head rolls down the street in the chapter?s final moments.7

Chapter five:  the jester king and his wife,
tense from all the beheadings, summon the new court jester.8

Chapter six:  the jester king transforms
into a vermin, or a dung beetle.9

VII:  The new jester slips poison into the jester king?s goblet.10

VIII:  The king dies and the queen dies of grief.11


Footnotes

1       Footnotes to poems should be longer than the poems
themselves.  T.S. Eliot set this precedent, aided by Ezra Pound, with
The Waste Land.  In addition to their length, the footnotes to The
Waste Land were clear to a fault.  They clarified the poem so much
that professors couldn?t think of anything smart to add.
Consequently, no professor ever taught the poem in an undergraduate or
graduate seminar.  This is why you have probably never heard of The
Waste Land or T.S. Eliot, who lived a sad, obscure life as a penniless
bank clerk and then died of irony.

2       As an undergraduate at the University of Washington, I went to
a night club called The OK Hotel to see a grunge band called Ezra
Pound open a show for my friend?s band, Pailey Sin.  At intermission,
I met Ezra Pound?s manager and asked about the name.  ?Ezra Pound was
such an interesting person,? said the manager.  ?She had to publish
using a male pen name because the Victorians wouldn?t accept a female
novelist.?  So I said ?Um, maybe the band should be called George
Eliot.?

3       In Aspects of the Novel, E.M. Forster explained that cause-and-
effect is the essence of plot, of storytelling.  As an example, he
asserted that ?The king died and then the queen died? is not a story
yet because the author has not shown causality between the events,
whereas the sentence ?The king died and the queen died of grief? does
show a causal relationship and therefore has the makings of a story.
Other examples would be ?I drank a lot last night, so I fell down? and
(here?s a more detailed causal chain, the outline of one of the
subplots of my novel A Staggering Bout of Breathless
Loquaciousness) ?I hit a tennis ball hard, over and over, until the
ball went flat and lost most of its yellow felt, so I gave the ball to
my Labrador, Maggie (short for Golden Majestic Princess, her AKC
name), who mouthed it and covered it in drool and then expected me to
pick it up and throw it to her, but I refused because ewww and ick,
and so now I don?t think my dog likes me much.?

4       One type of court jester was the jongleur, a court poet who
write in a style similar to the troubadours.  The troubadours favored
challenging forms, generically known as trobar clus, which included
sestinas and other word arrangements that were as difficult to
assemble as a 1,000 piece puzzle that looks like a Jackson Pollock
painting when it?s completed.

5       Heroic couplets were popular with Enlightenment-era poets like
Alexander Pope.

6       The scoring system in tennis (fifteen-thirty-forty-game) is
thought to have originated as an analogy to an hour on the clock.

7       ?If my thought dreams could be seen, they?d probably put my
head in a guillotine.? ? Bob Dylan

8       In Rainier Maria Rilke?s book, The Duino Elegies, Forest gives
Bubba?s mama a whole heap o? money that he got from Apple Computer
stock, so now she has women working in her kitchen, rather than vice
versa.  As a Ph.D. candidate at Florida State, I read in the school
paper that a band called Duino Elegies, composed of former members of
Ezra Pound, was performing at a Tallahassee club called The
Warehouse.  As Rainier Maria Rilke once wrote, ?That?s all I have to
say about that.?

9       Here the symbolism is obvious.  Becoming a king has not erased
his memories of demeaning, humiliating work.  On the inside, he still
feels like the lowest insect in the kingdom.  There is evidence that
The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka was influenced by Kafka?s reading of
Venus in Furs by Leopold Van Masoch.  There is also evidence that
Kafka stole his title from Ovid, so people should just shut up about
any similarities between this chapter and Kafka?s work.

10      It?s actually insect repellent, with 30% Deet.

11      In tennis, when two players stay back at the baselines and lob
the ball back and forth, the players are referred to
as ?moonballers.?  A match between two moonballers can go on forever,
but it?s thrilling to watch, like a performance by a top tier
comedian, a fellow of infinite jest.

OBITUARIES
Carl Rakosi, 100; Poet Was Admired for His Wry Wit and Insight

By Myrna Oliver, Times Staff Writer


Carl Rakosi, a prolific poet whose nonrhyming narratives were precise,
perceptive and pithy commentaries on life as he witnessed it, has died at the
age of 100.

Rakosi, cited as a major American poet by the National Poetry Foundation, died
June 24 in his San Francisco home of unspecified causes associated with aging.

Marilyn Kane, his partner since the death of his wife, Leah, in 1989, said
Rakosi had been in good health until the end and that only three weeks before
his death had shipped off a batch of new poems to the New York Review of Books.


His work influenced younger generations of poets, including the Beats. Lawrence
Ferlinghetti, poet and co-founder of San Francisco's City Lights bookstore,
called Rakosi "one of the poets that the Beat Generation poets read and admired
for his unadorned presentation of objective reality."

Rakosi was especially known for his down-to-earth "Americana" series of poems
and another called "Country Epitaphs," published in 1999.

In the latter, Rakosi's wry wit as well as insight on humanity sparkled in such
lines as, "The widow Fairchild spoke into a headstone: 'At last I know where he
is at night,' " or when the widow Benson similarly addressed her buried husband
with, "Gone but not forgiven."

Rakosi became associated with what became known as the objectivists — a term
coined by Louis Zukofsky — along with Zukofsky, George Oppen, Charles Reznikoff
and others, when all of them were invited to contribute to a special issue of
Poetry magazine funded by Ezra Pound.

"Objectivist writing," according to Contemporary Authors, "is characterized by
the presentation of concrete images; direct treatment of the subject without
ornamental verbiage; and insistence on a high degree of craftsmanship, such
that the poem itself is an object deliberately constructed in a form
appropriate to its content."

The term became "a bit of a nuisance," Rakosi conceded in a 2003 interview in
the American Poetry Review, because it begs definition yet cannot be defined by
the diverse work of the four poets. He said Zukofsky disliked being forced into
coming up with the term, but when he asked whether Rakosi minded its use, "I
wrote back: '… No, just as long as I get into the magazine.' "

Diane Wakoski, writing for the 1980 edition of Contemporary Poets, described
Rakosi's work as "short and sprightly and not at all meditative, though
seemingly made up of conclusions about the meaning of the world."

"It feels like the language of a man who has been active all of his life and now
has comments about everything he has experienced, slightly wry and not at all
uncritical, though delivered with friendliness," she wrote. "As a poet, he is a
sort of gadfly, not taking on any epic subjects … but stinging and buzzing
about everything, a reminder that to live intelligently is never to relax or to
leave unnoticed any slightly foolish thing — the poet as commentator on all of
life."

Rakosi published more than a dozen books of poems, from "Two Poems" in 1933
through "The Old Poet's Tale" in 1999, even though his pen was stilled for
about three decades beginning in the 1930s. After he married in 1939 and became
a father, he needed to earn a living. He chose social work, and found it simply
didn't mix with being a poet. Rakosi also attributed his hiatus to Marxist
doubts about the social utility of poetry.

Born in Berlin on Nov. 6, 1903, Rakosi spent his early years in Hungary and in
1910 came to the U.S. with his father, a watchmaker, who remarried and raised
him in Kenosha, Wis. He never again saw his mother, who died in Auschwitz.

Rakosi earned bachelor's and master's degrees in psychology at the University of
Wisconsin and later another master's degree in social work at the University of
Pennsylvania. After teaching briefly at the University of Texas in Austin, he
settled into a career as a social worker, family counselor and psychologist.

Throughout that career, he was known by the name Callman Rawley.

"At the time," he once said, "there were very few foreign names in the press,
and they were all factory workers. I thought I'd never get a job at a
university with a foreign name."

He worked in Chicago, Boston, New York, New Orleans, Austin, San Antonio, St.
Louis and Cleveland, and from 1945 until he retired in 1968 was executive
director of the Jewish Family and Children's Service of Minneapolis.

Fortuitously, as he contemplated his retirement, Rakosi received a fan letter
from a British student poet who was familiar with his early work and asked
whether he still wrote.

"It was like a missive from another planet," Rakosi said in an interview with
the American Poetry Review. "I had long assumed that nobody, I mean nobody,
remembered my work anymore or even remembered my name. That [he] found my work
so interesting meant that others of his generation might also. That knowledge
rushed through me and propelled me into writing again."

Rakosi churned out volumes of poetry, publishing the bulk of his work during his
latter decades.

The National Endowment for the Arts gave him awards and grants in 1969, 1972 and
1979. He received a distinguished service award from the National Poetry Assn.
in 1988 and the PEN Award in 1996 for his book "Poems, 1923-1941," published
the previous year.

In addition to Kane, Rakosi is survived by a son, George Rawley of Chico,
Calif.; daughter Barbara Rawley of London; six grandchildren; and four
great-grandsons.

The family has asked that memorial donations be sent to the Strybing Arboretum
Society, 9th Avenue and Lincoln Way, San Francisco, CA 94122.

nobody in my family ever knew any of those people (though there's some evidence
that my grandmother read Tennyson in between bouts of plowing) --

BUT, October 22 is the birthday of David Bromige, A.L. Nielsen, Cole Swenson and
any number of otherwise unrelated people who love poetry --- David worked for a
Scandinavian farmer once -- I come from a country nearby the Swenson place -- I
once watched Lyndon Johnson recite Carl Sandburg on the steps of the Lincoln
Memorial -- Sandburg was a Swede, which is almost Danish --

Harold Bloom says young folk shouldn't have computers in their libraries or
schools (see this morning's op ed pages) -- but then how will they manage to
cite those endless Chelsea House volumes they find on the web and think he
wrote?

I once met Harold Bloom -- but he ain't no Dane --

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

This is a piece I am reading as part of "Context for Peace," a jazz-spoken
word collaboration with the Ron Stallings ensemble which we are performing
tonight as part of the Stanford Jazz Festival.  Other poets are devorah
major and Tim'm West.

HIlton Obenzinger

Peace Comes to the World

Peace comes to the world.

Israelis and Palestinians are eager to share.   No one gets killed in
Jerusalem, no knives, no bombs, no soldiers, and everyone forgets that the
holy shrines exist.  Holy what?

All the looted artifacts and ancient Sumerian stone books wiggle their way
back into the Baghdad Museum.

Dick Cheney really does have a change of heart.

Politics becomes a way to meet new people and make sense of the world, a
kind of dating service and Department of Public Works in one.

Generals decide that the military's job will be to watch the skies for
dangerous asteroids that may hit us.  In the meantime, they'll clean up the
planet and stop computer spam.

Millions watch TV and walk away smarter.

Oil is no longer needed.  Machines run on dreams.

Iraqis never do learn how to play baseball, and they are glad.

Sir Lanka is no longer divided, Ireland is no longer divided, Kashmir is no
longer divided, Cyprus is one.  Koreans skip across the DMV.  Palestinian
refugees return to their homes, and their Israeli neighbors no longer know
why they wanted them to leave.

The LAPD snaps on soft handcuffs, the officers smiling and winking at
suspects and TV cameras.

No one is forced to give a blow job in a high school broom closet.

Crack and heroin and speed no longer have any effect, and cocaine might as
well be talcum powder.   Addictions become old movies to laugh at.

Indians shave off the faces of the presidents from Mt. Rushmore.

Sex is re-invented nightly.

Giant corporations hand over their profits to schools.

Rivers flow with pure water.

The president apologizes for slavery, and he actually weeps.

Most Americans can speak fluent Chinese, Spanish, French and at least one
more language in addition to English.  Millions finally do read Moby-Dick,
and they even like it.

No one sells their body for sex.  Women drive convertibles in Saudi Arabia.

No one is hungry.

Jerry Falwell admits that he really does not understand life, he can't
imagine what he had in mind when he spoke about Hell, and he decides that
sex is a healthy, ordinary and natural part of life.

A woman president takes maternity leave.

Racists really do get color blind.

High schools are named after Lenny Bruce and Charlie Chaplin.  The
Thelonius Monk School of Spiritual Mathematics opens its doors, and
Condeleeza Rice is the first to enroll.

All these and more can I see in a flash  and then the vision passes, dies
off.

I do not make a habit of deluding myself.  But on occasion it helps to
remember that nothing has to be the way that it is.

Sooner or later, history will kiss us on the lips.

Modesty of course forbids one from forms of boasting but too as so much is
being shared one is required to speak: I am on good terms with someone whose
late husband was close to Dylan Thomas, Ezra Pound and Robert Lowell, I also
know people who were acquainted with the young Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath
(they were too much in love, I was told, that's why they were doomed) and
someone else who was friends with Philip Larkin (Philip's problem was his
father, I have been told, he wouldn't let him speak)

Best of all I used to know a guy called John Sparkey who ran a piano shop in
Digbeth in Birmingham and claimed to be the only living descendant of the
poet Shakespeare. That claim was fiercely disputed btw.

Oh yeah, I've also slept on the same sofa cushions as Les Murray in
Melbourne and my mate Robin was around when Alisdair Gray read passages from
his then unpublished novel Lanark and nobody took any notice because they
were all too sloshed.

Okay, so I have a lot to say in response to these last three posts from
Stephen, Lucas and Murat, but I'm going to group them all into one post.
First, from Stephen:

>>Is there such a thing as an accurate epiphany in which the art work rises
(burns)  above the claims(including racial prejudices) of both artist and
subject into something independent, something either called true or
authentic and open to whatever interpretation any member of the public might
want to bring to it.???<<

I'm not entirely sure what this question means, but it sounds to me like
it's asking whether there is ever a way in which a work of art transcends
its own historical, cultural, political, etc. context. If that's what the
question means, I would have to say that the answer is no. This does not
mean that we cannot choose, sometimes for entirely valid and important
reasons, to set that context aside in our reading of a text, and it does not
mean that there aren't times when perhaps we should set that context
aside--which is something I am simply going to grant here without going into
the specifics of when that might be. But choosing to read a work of art this
way, as if it could transcend its own moment and the history and tradition
in which it and its future are implicated is also an ideological and
historical choice--it, too, in other words, does not and cannot transcend
itself--and it is important that we recognize this and take responsibility
for it when we do it. So, one might choose for any number of reasons to read
Pound's Cathay, for example, without any reference to the issues raised by
the conversation we've been having, but it seems to me incumbent upon the
person who does so, assuming he or she knows something about those issues,
to acknowledge that he or she is setting them aside in the interests of a
particular agenda. To be more specific, if I want to say that I am reading
and enjoying and celebrating Pound's Cathay because what I care about as a
poet/critic/reader are the possibilities the work opened up in English for
certain kinds of expression that did not exist in English at the time, and
that the work's implication in an imperialist
agenda/argument/dialectic/whatever is irrelevant to my reading, then I have
at least made my agenda clear. People might choose to quarrel with my
agenda, but that would mean they are also choosing not to accept the terms I
have defined for my reading and they would have to acknowledge that in
anything they have to say about my reading. (Not sure if that's really
clear.)

And then from Lucas:

>> but I guess in the end I'm still not completely sold on ideological and
historical readings. May be as simple as that<<

But as I said above, I think all readings are ideological and historical,
even those that want to suggest they are neither.

>>I can see this. But I'm still wary of the accusatory tone of much of this
kind of criticism [criticism that examines racism, etc.]<<

I cannot help but think here of the students in my creative nonfiction
class, which is a sophomore level honors class, who consistently, semester
after semester, complain of the accusatory, harsh, derogatory tone in my
comments on their papers. They find this tone in comments like "This makes
no sense" or "How do you know this?" or "Why should I believe you here?"
which to me are rather straightforward statements of my responses to what my
students have written. When we discuss this, I try to point out to them that
I state things as baldly as I do not because I think they are not good
writers but precisely because I take them seriously as writers, because I
think they are good enough and take themselves seriously enough not to need
euphemizing and gentle prodding. I respect them enough, I tell them, to say
straightforwardly what I think, and I also explain that it doesn't mean I am
always accurate. Finally, we talk about the fact that my comments are not
evaluations of who they are as people, but of the writing they have done. I
will not deny that there are critics who use accusations of racism or sexism
of whatever as a bludgeon with which to beat writers and artists, living and
dead, into a kind of submission to whatever the critic's ideological agenda
happens to be, but my own experience is that most critics are not doing
that. Rather, they are trying to engage in the kind of plain,
straightforward talking about the writing that I try to engage in with my
students. In any event, though, the fact that there may be critics who do
use accusations of racism, etc. as a weapon should not, I don't think, be
used to call into question the entire enterprise of understanding how all
those "isms" inform our culture and our cultural products. Critics who do
that need to be held accountable for it, but I have to say, as I have said
before, I don't think either Tim or I did that in the early stages of this
conversation, especially after Andrew explained what was at stake for him in
writing the poem. (I hate to keep returning to this point, but it troubles
me that we might be losing sight of the specific and I think in some ways
unresolved origin of this discussion as Tim's early responses are (in my
opinion unfairly) taken out of the context that motivated them--Andrew's
poem and Andrew's response to Tim's initial response--and placed in a very
different context, i.e. the question raised about Pound's Cathay and John
Yau and Stephen's more general questions about aesthetics, and so on. All of
those are worthwhile discussions to have, but there is a way in which I am
afraid they obfuscate the original issue, i.e., that Andrew's poem, before
his later disclosures, appeared racist on its face and that Andrew needed to
take responsibility for that. If we can agree that this issue has been
resolved, then the rest of this discussion need no longer to keep referring
back to Tim's response to Andrew and can become, simply and only, the larger
discussion it has obviously already become.)

>>I was, however, consciously using your question for different ends in
asking if the translator--even or especially when trying to counteract
racism (I believe that almost any act of translation is an act towards world
peace)--is always open to attacks such as these.<<

Okay, now the question is clear to me, and I think the answer is yes that a
translator is always open to this charge because there is always likely to
be someone who objects to what the translator has, consciously and
unconsciously, done. This does not mean that all charges of racism, or
whatever, are equally valid, nor does it mean that translators should
therefore stop translating or that translators should try to toe some
politically correct line when doing their work. It is simply to acknowledge
that cross-cultural work of any sort is fraught with these kinds of issues,
and I would argue it is better to tackle them head one than to question
whether they should or should not exist/be foregrounded in our attention in
the first place.

Then later in his post, Lucas is responding my earlier laying out of the
situation involving my own translation of Saadi into English. He makes a
couple of points:

1. In response to my saying how important Saadi was to Emerson, Thoreau,
etc: "This is a true testament to the power of translation! I don't care
about the imperialist history of finding a translator for Persian literature
as much as I care about other minds being able to access--even if just a
little bit--part of the depths of another culture."

2. In response to my talking about how my translation will perpetuate the
biases of Edward Rehatsek, the man from whose earlier translation I am
working: "but Rich, don't you think that you're placing a grand assumption
on Rehatsek's person by noting his biases? I'd never heard of him before you
alerted me, but isn't it possible that he, like you, took on this task of
translation for any number of reasons, and that perhaps, like you, racial,
colonial, cultural, and other biases were unimportant? Granted, you have his
language, his force-fitting of Muslim into Christian terminology, his
lawnmowering of verse forms, and so on. But perhaps the ends justify the
means: his work inspired Thoreau. And I think that is as much part of the
heritage of your translation as anything else."

What I'd like to say in response to this is that I do not think this is a
matter of either/or, but rather of both/and. Yes, it is crucially important
to acknowledge the importance of how Saadi, translated into English,
inspired Emerson and Thoreau and made Persian culture and history accessible
to many in the English-speaking world who were not writers, and I agree with
Lucas that this kind of work is vitally important to creating global
understanding, etc., and, yes, I hope that my own translation will become a
part of that very large and very important project, but it is also true, and
I would not wish to deny, that other forces beyond my control impinge on the
project itself, and on my part in it, and on Rehatsek's part in it, and on
the part of those who read Rehatsek and will, I hope, read my translation.
These two aspects of translation, it seems to me, exist in a constant
dialectic relationship with each other, and if we can speak plainly about
the celebratory side--as I think we should in order to do it justice--then
we should also speak as plainly about the other side, in which questions
about what is being celebrated are raised, because we need to do those
questions justice as well.

Finally, Murat wrote:

>>That a translation satisfies a need in the host language (or culture), to
me, is indubitable. A translator should acknowledge that. Even the cultural
attache who commissioned you is "more interested in finding a poet/writer
who could produce the kind of text he (italics my own) wanted in English
than he was in working with someone who is fluent in Farsi."<<

This is a fascinating idea which, intuitively, I agree with, but I would
love to talk more about. In my own case, the need in the host
language/culture is clear and was articulated by the person who hired me,
but what about people who translate whose translations are not commissioned
by someone from the host culture, who choose to translate without that sort
of impetus? How in that context do you find/define the need in the host
culture?

Okay, I think that's enough for now.

Richard

Dear Jesse -- this falls into the category of shameless self promotion, but
my poem featuring ghosts "Long After Mallarme" appeared in Best American
Poetry 2002 edited by Robert Creeley. Also another of my ditties
"Hypothetical" which appeared in 3rd Bed feaqtures some ghostly actvity
though no literal ghosts.


Hope this is helpful.

I just received information about this extraordinary article.  If you
go to the link, you'll find that it's a lengthy article, but a
thorough exploration of the outrageous development of the Bush
policies in Guantanamo.  The Supreme Court's response to the case is
somewhat surprising (and heartening).  Thought Poetics List folks
might be interested.

GREETINGS TO ALL!

It's my distinct pleasure to invite you to visit VQR's important new
web exclusive: "A Prison beyond the Law," an essay by Joseph
Margulies, lead counsel for the plaintiff in Rasul v. Bush,
forthcoming in our Fall 2004 issue. Margulies has produced for us—only
ten days after the Supreme Court rendered its ruling—a brilliant and
thorough work that is sure to be the standard point of reference when
historians return to this case and the aftermath of September 11
generally. It seems to us so important that we couldn't wait until
September to share it with you. Read it, and we think you will agree.

Margulies writes of the Bush administration's now-infamous Guantanamo
memos:

"If the jurisdiction memo placed the prisoners beyond the protection
of the federal courts, it was the Geneva Convention memo that
literally placed them beyond the law. In this memo, [administration
attorneys] Yoo and Philbin constructed an elaborate argument that the
prisoners at Guantanamo were not entitled to the protections of either
the Geneva Convention, or customary international law.... In the years
to come, much will be written about these memos, and the others that
followed in their wake. There is, for instance, an undeniable Alice In
Wonderland quality to some of the reasoning: in the first memo, Yoo
and Philbin argued that Guantanamo was beyond the jurisdiction of a
United States court because it is outside our sovereignty. Yet in a
later memo, Administration lawyers argued that because Guantanamo is
within the United States, Executive officials are not constrained by
federal laws against torture, since they operate only in a foreign
country. Reasoning like this is apparently the price of a dance with
the devil."

Subject: Computer Ate My Vote Day of Action


This Tuesday, July 13, supporters of auditable voting will be holding
public outreach events in at least 24 cities across the USA. These
events are intended to raise awareness of legislators to the need for
alternative balloting solutions in the counties where fully-automated
(DRE) voting systems will be deployed for November's election.  The DRE
systems, expected to be used by 30% of voters this year, provide no way
in which an independent recount can be performed from individual
ballots. (For a humorous but true look at this,
see:
<http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2004/07/07
/fioreelectronic.DTL>.)


Citizens need to ensure that state laws and county regulations will
permit the use of paper ballots (such as  the optically scanned ones
typically used for absentee voters) by any registered voter who requests

such at the polls. Ultimately, all self-auditing machines should be
recalled and retrofitted (as California will be doing by 2006).
Thankfully, more than 50% of the USA continues to vote on paper, the
only currently authorized method whereby a voter can confirm that their
vote has been recorded as intended, and that can be independently
recounted without machine assistance if questions arise as to the
integrity of the scanning equipment or software.  Paper ballots can be
inexpensively made disabled and non-English reading accessible (a fact
some paid lobbysts do not want people to know) -- see the links on my
website at <www.notablesoftware.com/evote.html>.

Further information about the Day of Action is below, follow the web
link for local details.  If your city is not on the list, do consider
creating your own event, or just contact legislators and election
officials to let them know your concerns about ballot verification and
recount capabilities for the election equipment planned for use this
Fall.  Do urge your US congressional representative to co-sign Rush
Holt's bill if he/she has not already done so. Feel free to copy and
distribute my brochure "Facts about Voter Verified Paper Ballots" also
on my website.

Thanks in advance for your support,
Rebecca Mercuri.

NATIONWIDE "COMPUTER ATE MY VOTE" DAY OF ACTION

VerifiedVoting.org Invites You to Join Voters in Your Area Asking
Election Officials to Pledge to Count All Votes

PLEASE JOIN US TUESDAY - Check the map to see if there is a rally near
you and join in!

Grassroots America: Take a stand for election integrity this Tuesday,
July 13, when supporters of voter-verified paper ballots (VVPBs) rally
and meet with the press in 24 cities nationwide.

Participants and local organizers will ask state and local election
officials to demonstrate their commitment to accurate and verifiable
elections by signing a "Pledge for Election Integrity."

In addition, attendees will present petitions from concerned voters
insisting on VVPBs.  This allows voters to confirm that their votes are
recorded as they intend, and elections officials to have a clear
confirmation of the voters' intent for counts, audits, and recounts.

A nationwide coalition of organizations came together to support these
events with outreach, promotion, and petitions by the hundreds of
thousands:  VerifiedVoting.org, TrueMajority.org, Democracy For America,

Common Cause, Electronic Frontier Foundation, MoveOn.org, Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility, Working Assets, and National
Coalition for Voting Integrity.

Rallies are scheduled for the following locations:
San Diego, CA; Denver, CO; Hartford, CT; Ft. Lauderdale, FL; Fort Myers,
FL; New Port Richey, FL; Sarasota, FL; Tallahassee, FL; Tampa, FL; West
Palm Beach, FL; Indianapolis, IN; Frankfort, KY; Annapolis, MD; Trenton,

(If no rally is taking place in your vicinity, please take a moment to
have a "virtual rally" -- visit your state page at VerifiedVoting.org
and contact your lawmakers to ask them to co-sponsor VVPB legislation!)

I'm looking for a bibliographic citation for the term Composition by Field.
I'm having trouble coming up with one, to my utter astonishment.

The first question is *to whom* should the term be attributed? I always
attributed it to Duncan. Those of us fortunate enough to hear Duncan speak
absorbed the term pretty much my osmosis -- he spoke of it quite
frequently. A Google search is turning up lots of "references" to the term,
but no citations, and people seem to be attributing it to Olson as often as
to Duncan -- which I don't think is really right.

Is there somewhere in Duncan's writings where he explains this? It wouldn't
be so strange if there weren't. At a reading once I went up to him and
asked where in the writings of Pound I could find Pound's explanation of
the term "tone leading vowels", which Duncan also spoke about rather often.
To my complete astonishment, he said that it wasn't anywhere! Apparently
Pound used the term in letters to Duncan and just assumed Duncan would know
what he meant; Duncan was pretty much left to figure it out for himself.

Surely the term applies to Olson as well as Duncan, but I'm under the
impression that Olson didn't really use the term himself. Am I wrong about
that??

Any refs gratefully accepted. The paper I'm writing is meant for computer
science types as well as lit / humanities folks.

Subject:      Carl Rakosi
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

For those interested in Carl Rakosi's life and work:

I am finishing up the edits on the transcript of a 19-hour life-history
interview with Rakosi that I conducted in the summer and fall of 2002 for
the Regional Oral History Office (ROHO) at UC Berkeley. The transcript will
soon be available through the Bancroft archive at UCB and Special
Collections at UCLA and will eventually be on-line. Some of the video from
this interview will be accessible through the ROHO website in the next few
weeks (http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/ROHO/).

The interview covers his life as a poet and as a social worker with equal
attention. Among the topics we discussed were the history of poetry in the
U.S. in comparison to other countries, his affiliation with the Communist
Party, his experiences in the Depression, his thoughts on the objectivists,
the evolution of social work and the field of psychology, retreats at Yaddo,
summer sessions at Naropa, the media's handling of the WTC catastrophe in
historical context, and his criticisms of Bush and Sharon. One of the most
developed and interesting trajectories that emerges in the interview was on
the global history of Jewish people's experiences. He talked about the
history of Jews in Hungary, his opinion of the differences among Jews from
different parts of the world, his understanding of Hungarian Jewish humor,
the contribution of Jews to societies, the genocide, the creation of Israel,
and the history of anti-Semitism as it changed over the decades in the US.

Here are three excerpts from the interview on different topics:

When we were talking about lyric and meditative poetry, Carl brought up the
idea of "sincerity." This is a term that Zukofsky used in his initial Poetry
Mag. essay about the objectivists, and Carl sees this as a test of truly
successful poetry.

"You're using metaphors a lot in that kind of poetry, and it's easy to fall
into affectations of different kinds. You want to make it as dramatic as
possible, so you push that. You want to make it as profound as possible, so
you use words to express profundity. But also, what is important here, and
that has to do more with sincerity--it has to be what you really feel, and
not what you inherited from some book--without any affectation. It has to be
honest. Probably the word honest would be a little better than
sincerity--honesty. I think, in that sense, all of the Objectivists had
that. I think they had it probably in part because they were immigrants or
of immigrant background. They were serious. They weren't playing games; they
weren't trying to be coy, like cummings for example. They weren't trying to
be clever, which again is a kind of trickery of real intellect. They were
just expressing what they were feeling, what they were thinking."


On a different day we were discussing a news story about rebels in Chechnya
holding people hostage in a theater. He was elated by the news.

"The whole world is sort of changing back in some ways. I notice for example
that the mothers and wives and sisters of people who had been imprisoned
by... Saddam Hussein were out on the streets. Now, I never would have
imagined that they would have dared to do that. Human nature, you can only
push it that far, even in the most despotic situations. It is going to rise
up. So, maybe we can be a little optimistic about what could happen now...
The whole world situation has become so interesting, so complex. You never
thought before that you could look at the whole world, and see what
everybody everywhere is doing, and how they are being affected by each
other. It has never happened before. So, we are into a new period in world
history it seems to me, which affects each person individually, because he
is aware of this. This is something new that is being brought into his
consciousness. I wish young people were perceiving this in this country,
because I noticed just in today's paper that the people who are voting are
not young people--two to one, they're older people, in their forties. Two to
one. Where are the young people? What are they thinking? Are they so cynical
that they don't want to vote? Are they so absorbed in their own personal
problems and lives that they are indifferent? Studies should be made of
that. But anyhow, it's great to be alive."


Having spent an afternoon with Carl going over his edits for this interview
just a couple of months ago, I am still in a kind of shock that he has
passed over. Of course it's ridiculous--he was heading into his 101st
birthday but he showed no signs when I saw him last of illness or even of
old age if you ask me. Around the time of his 99th birthday he realized that
he was 3 times older than I was. He said "I don't know what it's like to
feel ninety-nine. Well, a young person can't imagine what that could be...
the whole thing is unbelievable. We'll say I'm not really ninety-nine."

Finally, I am wondering if anyone can confirm, perhaps Michael Heller, the
rumor that was floating around the National Poetry Foundation's conference
in Maine that Carl's departing words were "Bush, that bastard." I'd
appreciate knowing.

Thanks,

Kim

Anyone visiting San Francisco or living in the Bay Area may want to take
advantage of the "Dahlia Garden" just to the east of the rebuilt
Conservatory - on Kennedy Drive not far inside the entrance of the Park. The
garden - protected by a low iron fence - is about 50 feet long and 15 feet
wide. Every seemingly imaginable possible Dahlia - complete with name tag -
is in "utter" full bloom. It is, as one might used to say, an "automatic
stoner" - wall to wall flowers in a robust, incredible variety of shapes and
colors.
Like the Huntington Library etc Rose Garden with it's "General McArthur"
rose - the Dahlia's here have some off the wall names, including, my
favorite, one called, "Franz Kafka"!
I don't know what the experience is called when the name of something is so
far removed from its subject (or object) so that the name disorients the
whole experience of looking  - but the Franz Kafka Dahlia (this week) takes
'the cake'.
The Dahlia, first native to the northern tropics (Guatemala, lower Mexico)
was given the name by a nineteenth century Swede, Frederick Dahl, who
perhaps never thought to ask the locals for its indigenous name.

YOUR NAME from YOUR ADDRESS. I am calling to urge the Senator to oppose
the Federal Marriage Amendment when it comes to a vote next week. The
proposed amendment to our founding document is unnecessary,
discriminatory, and undermines the principles upon which our

that you will concentrate on more important matters such as the
struggling economy, the war in Iraq, and health care, rather than
devoting time to a discriminatory, unnecessary amendment. Thank you."

hi,

it's in olson's "projective verse" (in _selected essays_, i think, for example)

"First, some simplicities that man learns, if he works in OPEN, or what can also be called  COMPOSITION BY FIELD, as opposed to inherited line, stanza, over-all form, what is the "old" base of the non-projective." (p. 16)

and: "From the moment he [the poet] enters into FIELD COMPOSITION--puts himself in the open--he can go by no track other than the one the poem under hand declares, for itself." (p. 16)

best,
Henrike

Well,perhaps 'someday' is closer than 'we' think, at least as
far as the new NEA study about the decline of literary reading goes.
The entire article cn be read in The Chronicle, www.chronicle.com,
but here's the first paragraph and a later quote:

Literary Reading Is Declining Faster Than Before, Arts Endowment's New Report Says
By SCOTT MCLEMEE



The populace of the United States may be divided by race, age, gender, region, income, and educational level. But according to a report released on Thursday by the National Endowment for the Arts, there is at least one thing that brings us all together: No group reads as much literature as it once did. If present trends continue, our aliteracy will only deepen over the next generation. After all, the steepest decline in reading has occurred among young adults, ages 18 to 24. ..

"Reading at Risk" states that the trends among young readers (or, perhaps, nonreaders) suggest that "unless some effective solution is found, literary culture, and literacy in general, will continue to worsen."
"Indeed, at the current rate of loss," it says, "literary reading as a leisure activity will virtually disappear in half a century."

Best,

Rebecca Seiferle

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and taverns!),
utilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented forms. We
will explore the structural possibilities of language to ultimately answer
the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning and practiced
poets will generate lots of original writing from this full day of language
play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye with which to
revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist who has performed and taught
extensively around the country. Her work has appeared in Paterson Literary
Review, Painted Bride Quarterly, Schuylkill Valley Journal of the Arts, Mad
Poets Review, and La Petite Zine. She also has a CD titled notspeak.

Fire department bars book-burning

Monday, July 12, 2004 Posted: 9:30 AM EDT (1330 GMT)

CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP)  -- A church's plan for an old-fashioned
book-burning has been thwarted by city and county fire codes.

Preachers and congregations throughout American history have built
bonfires and tossed in books and other materials they believed offended
God.

The Rev. Scott Breedlove, pastor of The Jesus Church, wanted to
rekindle that tradition in a July 28 ceremony where books, CDs, videos
and clothing would have been thrown into the flames.

Not so fast, city officials said.

"We don't want a situation where people are burning rubbish as a
recreational fire," said Brad Brenneman, the fire department's district
chief.

Linn County won't go for a fire outside city limits, either.

Officials said the county's air quality division prohibits the
transporting of materials from the city to the county for burning.

Breedlove said a city fire inspector suggested shredding the offending
material, but Breedlove said that wouldn't seem biblical.

"I joked with the guy that St. Paul never had to worry about fire
codes," Breedlove said.

The new plan calls for members of the church to throw materials into
garbage cans and then light candles to symbolically "burn" the
material.

Change of agenda: If you make poetry, no, let's see: if we can somehow add something potent to poetry, you kow, so we can hook the kids, so that poetry is not only a staple for the IV user but becomes a nasty habit, if, in fact, there were a way to give away 'free poetry' and possibly hook customers on the residual effects, i.e. habituation, then we can ultimately raise the price of poetry and make millions perhaps, legally, and then outbid, of course, our old buddies the novelists. Of course, poetry use will have to reach academic, I mean, epidemic proportions, but then we'll all be rich! And maybe, maybe we can have Poetics, Inc! We can privatize poetry!!! We can also layoff those who built the foundations fo poetry!!! Maybe we can even attack foreign countries on account of their 'not complying with proper form and content' restrictions!!!

Oh my god, We're going to be billionaries!!!

Subject:      "Instrumentality"  by Ravi Shankar
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

I dislike reading poetry that panders to the popular moment.  That said, =
I begin this commentary by acknowledging that I thoroughly enjoyed =
reading the poetry in this slim volume by Ravi Shankar.=20

My enjoyment stems primarily from the fact that I'm a word/phrase whore. =
 I'd trade my identity...hell, my soul...for a well turned phrase and a =
clever quip or an incite rich comment or question about the human =
condition.=20

Ravi Shankar has managed, in an extremely short work to amass a =
veritable treasure of such verbal delights here in this work, =
Instrumentalty.

He's quick, as in his poem, Oracle of Insomnia  when he intones, =
"...Unable to sleep, I miss you."=20

Better, he's tender, as in his work, An Affair, when he creates both a =
visual and an aromatic element of the moment: =20

    "Licorice scent: an opalesence paws
     Loose the hunger, whirring intricate

    Machinery into action -..." =20

All told, this is a brilliant piece of vocality (pardon that horrific =
word) presented as a work of instrumentation.  Some of the phrases so =
well balance each other that when one reads the line, one knows there is =
no reason to read further, and one recognizes the delicate balance that =
exists between the vocal and the instrumental, between the harsh and the =
gentile. =20

My favorite piece though, and no doubt I'm prejudiced because of my =
former life of having lived in the Village and having stomped and =
tromped the streets and the avenues around Hells kitchen is the work:  =
Returning From Hell's Kitchen.  Allow me to quote:

"Now that the gargoyles have oxidized,
Skyscraper stalks sprout lenticular panes.
Another rush-hour overpowers the hush
Or such ambient din as passes for silence
In the self-proclaimed center of the world.

Underground, trains groan into stations
To be filled with eyes that never marry,
Toothless mouths that occasionally break
Into songs about joy in the face of loss,=20
The rhythm section a few coins in a cup.

The rest all pleats and loosened ties,
Various gears unscrewed from labor's
Leviathan watch.  Simple not to muse
When in transit: people board, disembark,
And instantly, the space they leave is filled."

I hear in this silent intonation the kind of loneliness and desperation =
that seems forever to be present in the bus stations and the boulevards =
of the world's mega-populated centers.=20

Never in my life have I been more lonely than when I lived in NYC; and =
never have I felt that loneliness, complete with the essential element =
of longing, better expressed than in this small poem. =20

But, Ravi Shankar's work offers more than this trivial emotionalism that =
I've highlighted.=20

There is also a brilliant presentation of metrical form...I'll leave =
analysis here to the metrical scansion academic folks to identify.  I =
for one don't care what kinds of labels could be affixed to label the =
poems, but I'm certain some will offer critical comments about the =
structure of the works within the volume.=20

I almost pity those people, the ones who must put a name to a form or a =
style: this is an ode, this a sonnet, etc. etc. etc.   In the stead of =
that labeling,  I pronounce these works as outstanding poems, worthy of =
both having been written and having been read. =20

Meanwhile, thanks for reading, and hurry to Ravi's work to listen in =
full delight.

I think this phenomenon is to blame for the predicament we currently
face with George W.

The mass populace doesn't read often enough to get to the truth of any
issue. Of course,
the U.S. media is also to blame. Their lack of reporting amounts to a
cover-up every time.

Well,perhaps 'someday' is closer than 'we' think, at least as
far as the new NEA study about the decline of literary reading goes.
The entire article cn be read in The Chronicle, www.chronicle.com,
but here's the first paragraph and a later quote:

Literary Reading Is Declining Faster Than Before, Arts Endowment's New
Report Says
By SCOTT MCLEMEE



The populace of the United States may be divided by race, age, gender,
region, income, and educational level. But according to a report
released on Thursday by the National Endowment for the Arts, there is
at least one thing that brings us all together: No group reads as much
literature as it once did. If present trends continue, our aliteracy
will only deepen over the next generation. After all, the steepest
decline in reading has occurred among young adults, ages 18 to 24. ..

"Reading at Risk" states that the trends among young readers (or,
perhaps, nonreaders) suggest that "unless some effective solution is
found, literary culture, and literacy in general, will continue to
worsen."
"Indeed, at the current rate of loss," it says, "literary reading as a
leisure activity will virtually disappear in half a century."

Best,

Rebecca Seiferle

From "Maverick" to Attack Dog
Howard Dean's Gay Bashing of Ralph Nader
By SHERRY WOLF

Howard Dean gay bashed Ralph Nader on live radio before millions of
listeners on NPR and no one chimed in to stop him. How could the Vermont
also-ran, shilling for the anti-gay marriage John Kerry, slander the only
presidential candidate who is for gay marriage by claiming over and over
that Nader had accepted support from anti-gay Republicans?

Nader has not only come out for same-sex marriage--a basic civil
right--but he is for ending legal discrimination against gays and lesbians
that allows employers to fire someone for their sexual orientation in 36
states. Kerry and Dean oppose same-sex marriage, and both have repeatedly
argued to leave it to the states to decideÐreminiscent of the Dixiecrats
of old who argued to leave desegregation to the enlightened minds of the
Mississippi and Alabama legislators. As a result, segregation remained the
de facto law of the land for a century after the Civil War.

Though Dean is often trumpeted as a great advocate of gay and lesbian
rights because Vermont was the first state to offer civil unions while he
was governor, the reality behind that partial victory exposes Dean's own
opportunistic nod to the homophobes. When the Vermont Supreme Court
unanimously ruled that gay couples were due the same legal rights of
marriage as heterosexuals and ordered the legislature to pass a law to
that effect in 1999, Dean made it clear that he would not sign gay
marriage into law and pushed instead for civil unions.

Civil unions do not carry with them any of the 1,049 federal rights and
benefits of marriage. When Dean did sign civil unions into law, he did so
"in the closet," without the usual cameras flashing and notables in
attendance. At the time of signing, according to the Chicago Sun-Times,
Dean "was going around the state telling folks he was only doing it
because the Vermont Supreme Court made him."

Kerry voted against Clinton's Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in
1996--though 118 Democrats voted for it--but since then he has come out
strongly against same-sex marriage and has repeatedly condemned the
Massachusetts legislature for granting marriages to gay and lesbian
couples.

Though the Democrats theoretically support the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) that would eliminate the right of employers
to fire someone for their sexual orientation, they have allowed it to
languish on paper for a decade without ever hitting the floor of Congress.
According to the Washington Post, Bill Clinton held a closed-door meeting
in 1997 with advocates of ENDA--which has been chiseled away at to include
notable exemptions for small businesses, the armed forces and religious
organizations. Clinton's "support"for gay civil rights was so half-hearted
that he refused to use his influence to even get a vote on ENDA onto the
House floor.

The Dean-Nader debate was aired on the very day when Republicans in the
Senate were pushing to write discrimination against gays and lesbians into
the Constitution via the Federal Marriage Amendment.

While Dean worked himself into a lather trying to slam Nader and prove his
party's credentials as fighters for equal rights, neither Senators Kerry
nor Edwards made an issue of this first attempt since slavery to include a
denial of rights in the Constitution.

Those concerned with gay issues should remember the lessons from the
Clinton years when deciding whom to vote for in November. Clinton's own
Presidential AIDS Panel criticized his administration for failing to show
a "coherent plan of action" against AIDS in 1998, despite the abundance of
evidence indicating the effectiveness of preventive efforts, including
needle exchanges. Though Clinton's "don't ask, don't tell" policy led to
witch-hunts of gays in the military, gay press such as The Advocate,
Lambda Legal Defense and most AIDS activists in ACT-UP insisted that gay
rights supporters vote for a second Clinton term in 1996 and not mobilize
protests that might embarrass Clinton.

The only real substance to Howard Dean's charges against Nader was in his
attack on the endorsement Nader has received from the right-wing Reform
Party. And while I find this party of Neanderthal blowhards to be
repugnant in its anti-immigrant and homophobic views--they are not the
views of Ralph Nader!

Nader's clumsy handling so far of the Reform Party's endorsement should be
challenged by his supporters, but taking heat from the likes of Democrats
who have helped shape anti-gay policies such as "don't ask, don't tell"
and DOMA is simply nauseating.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, protests against gay bashing and for
AIDS drugs and gay rights exploded onto the streets of dozens of cities in
response to the reactionary policies of the Reagan and Bush I
administrations. These protests gave confidence to millions of gays and
forced a bigoted Bush administration to fund AIDS research and back down
from the verbal belligerence towards gays that marked previous
administrations.

Thousands of workplaces were pressured to provide domestic partner
benefits to lesbians and gays. Yet there has been almost no national
mobilization for gay rights since the 1993 demonstration of hundreds of
thousands in Washington, D.C., where the incoming Democratic
administration was praised for its promise to improve the lives of
lesbians and gays.

But the Democrats have reneged on those promises. According to the
National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, more than 50 lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transgendered people have been reported killed in attacks
since Matthew Shepard's murder, though the actual number of deaths is
likely higher because many antigay attacks go unreported.

The strategy of electing Democrats to deliver civil rights for lesbians
and gays has been a dismal failure.

What strikes me here is "reading as a leisure activity will virtually
disappear in half a century." I'm always suspicious of statements like this,
as if the person can predict what the world will be like fifty years from
now, when even tomorrow will be a surprise. However, it is not strange that
books, and this is what the study is about, are on a downhill slope, because
exciting transformations are happening to our species. So instead of
bemoaning the decline of one medium, one that has earned a place, and will
always have a place, even if not a major place, in human culture, let's look
at the potential of new media, and how we can transform what we call
"literature."

For a course I will be teaching in the fall on non-western literature, I am
looking for poems, books or individual poems, by non-western authors-which
for the purposes of the course description seems to mean almost everything
but the US and western Europe-that deal in some way with political torture.
Because of material I have already identified, I would specifically be
interested in material from Japan, Afghanistan, Iran, Korea or South/Central
America, but I'd be interested to learn about whatever you know about. Front
or backchannel, doesn't matter.

From the Human Rights Campain via Andy Ditzler. Sorry, it seems the list has

  Dear Human Rights Campaign Activist,

Three weeks ago, our allies in the Senate told us they were hearing from
our pro-FMA opponents by a 5 to 1 margin (10 to 1 in some cases!).

Last week, your efforts made a difference: some Senators told us we were
still outnumbered, but only by a 2 to 1 margin.

*BREAKING NEWS:* the Senate Republican leadership turned down an offer
from the Democrats for a vote on the substance of the Federal Marriage
Amendment and instead filed for cloture on the amendment. Cloture is a
procedural motion that limits debate in the Senate (and pre-empts any
attempts at filibustering). The Republican leadership could change its
strategy yet again, but as of now the vote on cloture is expected to
take place on Wednesday, July 14 at 12pm.

Today -- Tuesday -- the day before the Senate votes on cloture for the
Federal Marriage Amendment, please help us narrow the gap even more. For
one day, make your Senators' phones ring off the hook with 100,000 calls
from constituents like you. Call your Senators today to ask them to
oppose the FMA and to vote against cloture (even if you already have):
1-202-225-3121

The line may be busy due to the high volume of calls today - be persistent!

If the above number is busy, click here to look up the direct lines for
your Senators:

And then, ask five more people to do the same. It's important that
Senators hear from NEW people - so, forward this e-mail, print it off
and hand it to a friend, or click here to send many friends an e-mail
from our system:
http://www.hrcactioncenter.org/ct/mpaes8K1UjT9/

Yes, we've been asking you to call your Senators often for almost two
weeks. Why? It's working. When we concentrate our efforts into this one,
critical activity rather than many different actions, our voices are
heard louder than ever before. Please, stick with us for just one more
day. Make that call. And get a friend or two to join you.

Need some added inspiration? Listen to this:

    * The good: Robert Novak wrote in his column in the Chicago Sun
      Times on Sunday: "Moderate Republican senators grumble that some
      longtime contributors are refusing their usual contribution to the
      Republican presidential campaign. Their biggest grievance: Bush's
      endorsement of the anti-gay marriage constitutional amendment."
    * The bad: President Bush spent the weekend calling on the Senate to
      pass the FMA in both his radio address and at a campaign stop in
      Pennsylvania. In a week dominated by reports of CIA mismanagement,
      President Bush's focus on the FMA is a clear effort to take focus
      off the real problems facing his administration.
    * The truly ugly: yesterday during debate, Senator Rick Santorum
      (R-PA) said that the FMA is necessary to "stop what I believe is
      the death knell of our society."

Many thanks for all your efforts. Make that call!

New York Anarchists Object to Cop's Using Them as an Excuse to Terrorize
Public


     Recent statements by New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly,
reported in the New York Daily News ("Anarchy Threat to City: Cops fear
hard-core lunatics plotting convention chaos", July 12), give us a taste
of the kind of hysteria New Yorkers can expect in the weeks leading up
to the Republican Convention in August.

New York Anarchists Object to Cop's Using Them as an Excuse to Terrorize
Public


Recent statements by New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly,
reported in the New York Daily News ("Anarchy Threat to City: Cops fear
hard-core lunatics plotting convention chaos", July 12), give us a taste
of the kind of hysteria New Yorkers can expect in the weeks leading up
to the Republican Convention in August.


Time after time, before summits and conventions, police make bizarre,
hysterical predictions about anarchists plotting terror and mass
destruction - predictions which have never, once come true. But the fact
that they invariably prove false never stops the police from doing it
again, or the local media from taking them seriously.

Therefore, some of us feel it might be helpful to issue a small reality
check.

1) Who are anarchists?

Anarchists are people who believe that rather than being controlled by
governments, it would be better for human beings to manage their own
affairs on the basis of self-organization, voluntary association and
mutual aid. We look forward to a society in which people are brought up
to be reasonable and respectful of one another and therefore, in which
police will not have to exist. This is why police don't like us very much.

In America, anarchists have long campaigned for greater freedom and
democracy. Anarchists were crucial, for instance, in the creation of
groups like Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union;
anarchist labor unions were the main force pushing for the 8-hour-day.

2) What are New York anarchists really doing about the Republican
National Convention?

There are hundreds of anarchists in New York who, like so many New
Yorkers, feel that the Republicans' decision to hold their convention in
our city is a cynical ploy to exploit the memory of our suffering on
September 11th that should not go unanswered. There will, certainly, be
protests, and probably very large protests. Anarchists are involved in
every aspect of the planning and preparations, from United for Peace and
Justice, which is planning a mass march and rallies, the Still We Rise
coalition of community-based groups, the RNC Clearinghouse, which is
trying to coordinate housing, transportation, artistic and theatrical
events, among many other things, the People's Law Collective, that will
be providing legal support to protesters or other New Yorkers arrested
during the protests, teams of medics to provide care and assistance for
protesters or other New Yorkers injured during the protests, and so on.
So far, one of the main concerns of the anarchists involved in planning
the protests has been to insist that everything is done openly and
democratically; that in our organizing, we should provide an example of
real democracy to contrast to the phony, sham "democracy" the Republican
Convention represents.

3) But what about all those police claims of violent or terroristic
behavior?

Time after time police have made similar claims. Time after time they
have been proven to be lying.

Just look at the hard facts, compare police predictions before and
during protests with what actually ends up happening. Again and again,
police spokesmen predict terrible violence. They predict goons with
molotov cocktails, anarchists setting off bombs, protesters throwing
acid or slabs of concrete at policemen, or even more bizarre fantasies -
during the last Republican Convention, for instance, Philadelphia police
claimed anarchists were preparing to release poisonous snakes and
reptiles all over the city. During the protests, they often claim such
things are actually happening. But every time, when it's all over,
police are either forced to grudgingly admit they were "mistaken" (the
molotovs turned out to be paint thinner used in making puppets, the van
full of reptiles turned out to be owned by a pet store), or they just
stop talking about it and hope nobody notices that none of these things
ever actually occurred.

Real terrorists try to create terror. They threaten to do terrible
things, to kill and maim innocent people, if governments do not agree to
their demands. Then they go out and do it. Afterwards, they boast about
it and threaten more. Here we have the exact opposite. The anarchists
who help organize protests in America have never threatened to hurt
anyone, never claimed to have hurt anyone, and in fact, in four years of
protests, have never have hurt a single innocent bystander in any way.
Despite that, every time there's a major protest, the police keep trying
to terrify the public by predicting mayhem, and the anarchists keep
desperately trying to reassure the public that there's nothing to be
frightened of, that the last thing we'd ever want to do is to harm them.

In other words, it's the police spokesmen who keep trying to create a
climate of terror. We keep trying to diffuse it.

So who's the terrorist?

4) But why would the police want to terrify the public?

Allow us to suggest one very simple reason.

Rich people don't like it if you try to ruin their parties.

If you think about it, this is pretty obvious. There was once a time
when the richest and most powerful men on earth--bankers, politicians,
Enron-style executives--could meet wherever they wanted, sip their
martinis, go to their lavish balls, and hold fancy summits where they
discuss what economic policies to impose on the rest of the world. Ever
since Seattle, almost every time they try to meet, they find themselves
faced with thousands of indignant citizens determined to practice
non-violent civil disobedience to try to spoil the party. Protesters
blockade streets. They chain themselves to doorways. They lie down in
front of traffic. Some of them even place trash cans and dumpsters in
the middle of the street or sing rude songs outside posh hotels. How
could the people attending these summits not find this annoying?

Obviously, the party-goers feel it is the job of the police to do
whatever it takes to make the protesters cut it out.

The police, in turn, have to do what they're told. After all, even when
the party-goers do not actually include heads of government like George
Bush, we are talking about the richest and most powerful men on earth.
During several protests in Washington, for example, it was publicly
announced that units of the DC police had been put under the direct
command of the IMF (an international banking organization).

The problem is, as the police discovered in Selma, Alabama and other
places many years ago, you can't stop such forms of civil disobedience
without being very violent towards a large number of American citizens.
Especially if you're trying to so traumatize them that they will be
reluctant to come out and try it again. You have to hit people, beat
them with sticks, teargas them, shoot them with tazers and plastic
bullets, sweep up hundreds in mass arrests (where they can then be
treated in a style not unreminiscent of some of what we've recently seen
at Abu Ghraib). All this is now regularly done, but it puts the police
in a delicate situation. After all, they are being asked to attack some
of the very American citizens they are supposed to be protecting. What's
more, when you start using teargas and mass arrests and opening fire on
crowds of people with tazers and rubber bullets, it's impossible to
ensure that you only hurt the protesters. Inevitably, you will be
injuring innocent bystanders as well.

So the question becomes: how can you possibly justify police tactics
that you know endanger the public against a group which does not
endanger the public in any way?

If you want the answer, just look at what people like Commissioner
Raymond Kelly say and do.

5) Could the police really be intentionally endangering the public?

Well, that depends on what you mean by "intentionally". Most police
officers are decent human beings doing their jobs like anybody else,
trying their best to serve and protect a public that doesn't pay them
very well or fully appreciate the risks they have to take. Certainly
they are not going to intentionally try to hurt innocent bystanders.

The people who run the police however are basically politicians and like
most politicians, they tend to lie. Probably, one of the main targets
for all these tall tales about protester violence are their own
subordinates, street cops who might otherwise feel uncomfortable about
attacking the very citizens they are sworn to protect.

Once again, if you don't believe us, check the facts. Look at what
really happens. Count the numbers of people who end up injured after a
major protest. Usually, there are hundreds of injuries among the
protesters. Sometimes there are a handful of injured policemen, too,
though it usually turns out they were mainly injured by things that
other policemen did. We are not aware of a single report of an innocent
bystander ever having been injured by a protester at a big summit or
convention. But every time there is a major protest, there are dozens,
often hundreds, of reports of innocent bystanders shackled, hogtied and
thrown in jail, clubbed, kicked, hit by "non-lethal" weapons like rubber
or plastic or wooden bullets. There have been endless horror stories:
pregnant women who abort because of CS gas, American citizens losing
teeth, eyes, ending up with permanent disabilities, dying prematurely of
conditions caused by police use of force. If foreigners did this to
American citizens the press would certainly be calling them terrorists.
And they'd be right.

So, to Commissioner Kelly and all the other politicians who control our
nation's police, we say this. Stop trying to terrify the public about
non-existent threats. There are plenty of real threats to spend your
time worrying about. Stop attacking American citizens who are trying to
exercise their constitutional rights. Stop using tactics that endanger
the public. And if that means some rich people or foreign bankers or
Republican delegates have a hard time getting to their party sometimes:
so what? They're rich. They can handle it. Maybe it will encourage them
to think a little bit about what they're doing. Anyway, it's not like
anybody's clubbing them or dragging them off in shackles or shooting
them with poison gas, like you're doing to prevent them from being
inconvenienced.

Maybe you should think about what side you're really on.

i second your suspicion, joel. first, persons thirst for prophetic

fulfillment. in this case, no one will read about it, anyway. third, it
would be quite interesting to investigate how many times someone =
pronounced
the death of poetry.

if poetry is a genre, you're quite right larry, bush certainly doesn't
belong to the same species.

falling prey to my own aphorisms:=20
if reading is at risk, it's because few take up the risk of reading.

a savant dermatologist announced in the science section of new york =
times
that it is so hard to dissuade humans from sun-bathing because u.v. rays
give us pleasure.

reading poetry doesn't give pleasure the same way reading a thriller =
might.
poetry doesn't care to preserve our identity.=20
in face of a truly great poem, "i" am threatened, put out, out of the =
house
of my own self, forced into something like homelessness, which is =
perhaps
just thinking.

perhaps somewhat naively, i think that poetry is more than a medium: a =
way
of thinking, if that, since in its refusal of systems or even =
consistency,
it's rather at odds with a certain notion of philosophy, more wayward =
than
way-faring.

i think the "prophetic" writer of new york times is rather na=EFve in =
his
prophecies. i think people will read poetry, or write it for that =
matter, as
long as they're even vaguely interested in inquiring into what it is to =
be
human.

so, in the end, perhaps, the question of a genre is a question of =
species.

What strikes me here is "reading as a leisure activity will virtually

this,

books, and this is what the study is about, are on a downhill slope, =

The following is taken from the Jive Turkey weblog,

Ron

http://www.livejournal.com/users/jiveturky/185733.html

 The single greatest event of my life.

 So I went to protest Dubya today, as he was visiting my humble little
burg of East Lampeter, PA.

 Adam came over and with my and Matt's help, created two banners. They
read:

 DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER

 and

 MORE TREES, LESS BUSH

A friendly Kerry supporter named Mr. Shenk let us use his front yard to
display our banners. Now comes the good part. After waiting around for
about
45 minutes, the motorcade passed by us again. A few police cars,
followed by
a van or two, drove by.

Then, a Bush/Cheney bus passed, followed by a second one going slower.
At
the front of this second bus was The W himself, waving cheerily at his
supporters on the other side of the highway. Adam, Brendan, and I rose
our
banner (the More Trees, Less Bush one) and he turned to wave to our side
of
the road.

His smile faded, and he raised his left arm in our direction. And then,
George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States of America,
extended
his middle finger.

Read that last sentence again.

I got flipped off by George W. Bush.

 A ponytailed man standing next to us confirmed the event, saying, "I do
believe the President of the U.S. just gave you boys the finger."

We laughed probably for the next half hour, and promptly told everyone
we
knew. Brendan actually snapped a picture of Bushy in action, but the
glare and the tint of the bus windows make it difficult to see him at
all.

Nonetheless, it was the best possible reaction.

 We pissed George W. Bush off. We are true patriots.

surely,


this is what happens. we get up in the morning and work all day and then we go
home and work hard at night. we are brilliant creators of new media. our work
is vast and forward of others. the conference people are incredible innovators
and the rest of the world stands or sits, mouths open and in awe. our
adventures are risky but full of recompense, and our eyes are far-sighted as we
leave the twenty-first century and prepare for the next. you will know our
names in the future and they will be household names. our names will become
nouns for everyday worlds and beyond. we know we are your future and our own,
and we are prepared, better than anyone, for what will occur in this
impoverished and almost-extinct technological planet of ours. we are the
stewards and you are the flock. or you are the shepherds, and we are your
flock, brilliant and wise, tending our humans far from their homes of sadness
and mourning. welcome us, for we are your salvation, the woman of, the flesh of
the woman of, the world of the woman of the flesh, the man and the hardness of
the flesh of, the man of, the steel of the woman and the man

** Worldwide Call for Submissions **

LEA Special Issue: New Media Poetry and Poetics

Guest Editor: Tim Peterson (tscotpeterson@hotmail.com)

The Leonardo Electronic Almanac (ISSN No: 1071-4391) is inviting papers and
artworks that deal with New Media Poetry and Poetics. This category includes
multimedia digital works (image/text/sound) as examined through the lens of
"writing," specifically any of those concerns central to poetry rather than
narrative or prose: reader as active participant in the "ergodic" sense, the
use of stochastic methods and chance procedures, and the complex relations
between the author, reader, and computer-as-writer/reader which evolve from
that interaction. Modes of work that foreground the digital medium (such as
"codework") are also welcome. We would particularly like to emphasize the
"poetics" of new media writing as well, that is, the point where aesthetics
intersects with politics to create dynamic attempts at social change.

LEA encourages international artists / academics / researchers / students to
submit their proposals for consideration. We particularly encourage authors
outside North America and Europe to send proposals for
articles/gallery/artists statements.

Proposals should include:
-       300 word abstract / synopsis
-       A brief author biography
-       Any related URLs
-       Contact details

Deadline for proposals: 15 Aug 2004

Please send proposals or queries to:
Tim Peterson

FEATURE: A room of one's own
Can fiction create its own space within the pages of the LGBT press?
By Eleanor Brown

Managing editor Lisa Neff wondered about publishing fiction in her=20
weekly Chicago Free Press when some readers had a hard time=20
distinguishing it from fact. "I'd receive invitations from readers who=20=

wanted to date the main character.

"That's one problem with running fiction in a non-fiction news=20
publication."

The Free Press ran serial fiction from its very first issue, in August=20=

1999, written by humorist Michael "Boomer" Beaumier and filled with=20
local references. The column ran half a page (between 500 to 800=20
words), and readers enjoyed it, recalled Neff. It managed to be=20
political without being dull or preachy: "It tackled everything, drag,=20=

drugs, pride, politics, affairs, sex, romance, body image..." The=20
column ended eventually, but Neff said she would like to test out the=20
idea again.

The Free Press also publishes excerpts from new novels regularly. But=20
no short stories or poetry.

In fact, finding literary fiction in a general interest LGBT=20
publication is a rarity.

The reasoning varies. Liberty Press, out of Kansas, can't fit fiction=20
into its monthly average of 52 to 68 pages. "Since we are the only=20
paper in Kansas and mainstream media covers none of our issues really,=20=

we like to reserve the space for actual [local] news," said editor=20
Kristi Parker.

The bimonthly Out in Jersey has run poetry - but rarely. The few=20
stanzas were from unpaid staffers who contribute other work. Space is a=20=

problem, said general manager Peter Frycki, and there's no money to pay=20=

for it. Plus, he added, the "quality of the pieces runs the gamut from=20=

very good to complete garbage."

Lavender managing editor Travis Stanton said fiction doesn't fit in=20
with his biweekly Minneapolis magazine's mandate (and soon after taking=20=

over the job 19 months ago, he stopped running serial fiction). Marty=20
Davis, publisher and managing editor of Portland, Ore.'s biweekly Just=20=

Out, echoes: "It's just not our format."

Others have dipped in a toe, then pulled it out quickly. Jeff Balk=20
publishes three magazines that share some content (EXP St. Louis, the=20
mid-Atlantic's EXP Gayzette, and another serving Indiana, Ohio, and=20
Kentucky). "We tried what one could call erotic fiction without the=20
descriptive sex. Some people were offended by this and even referred to=20=

it as pornographic.... We did not want to take any chances as we were=20
fairly new at that point."

"Maybe," Balk added, "it was the wrong style of writing." But he said=20
no readers have ever asked for fiction of any kind. They want club=20
scene info and news, entertainment, horoscopes, and gossip.

Yet regardless of the lack of feedback, fiction, and even poetry, are=20
an integral part of the national quarterly glossy Transgender Tapestry=20=

Journal.

On the one hand, few magazines get any sort of reaction to their=20
fiction. "I just think fiction doesn't punch people's buttons in the=20
same way as, say, an opinion piece that stimulates them to write," said=20=

editor in chief Dallas Denny.

But even if they did react, Denny said she'd humor the wants of the=20
readers only so much. "There is a genre of transgender fiction that is=20=

primarily wish fulfillment." Such works "are about seeing in the mirror=20=

a person (crossdressed) who approximates to some extent the internal=20
reality of the individual. I believe many of our readers would just=20
love for us to stuff this sort of thing between the covers, but I won't=20=

do it. I want to expose the readers to good work."

Denny said fiction rounds out her magazine, and she enjoys supporting=20
authors who produce superior writing (they used to get paid in magazine=20=

copies; now they receive a one-year subscription, and retain copyright).

Transgender Tapestry runs one page of poetry in every issue. "Our=20
poetry editor is quite PoMo in her tastes, and we've not had a poem=20
that rhymes in years," said Denny. Fiction appears at least twice a=20
year: "It depends on whether good stuff comes in.... We are able to run=20=

all the good fiction we receive."

For the first time in more than five years, Chicago's Windy City Times=20=

printed a literary supplement this summer, an eight-pager for Pride,=20
instigated by two long-time contributors and fiction writers (Kathie=20
Bergquist and Owen Keehnen).

These specialists, as it were, separated out the best writing, which=20
publisher Tracy Baim felt was a task beyond her time availability and=20
her more nonfiction-based, journalistic abilities. (Actually, Baim has=20=

authored her own fact-based novel about gay men and lesbians serving in=20=

the military during the Gulf War, but she said that fiction "was not a=20=

true lifelong passion," as it is for others.)

"I prefer if we have limited space that it mostly be lesser known=20
writers," added Baim, noting that most of the manuscripts hailed from=20
Chicagoans. "We did not seek out any special 'name' folks."

The fees were comparable to the paper's other writing payments, and=20
most of the pieces were previously unpublished. Writers retained=20
copyright.

Baim said there was good reaction from readers, and she's considering=20
doing more such supplements, and perhaps even adding a photo/art=20
category. But there's money to worry about.

"With very few bookstore and literary-related ads, it makes it hard to=20=

dedicate space to a project like this.... In the future, a combination=20=

of web-based and print-based lit pieces might be the way we go."

This an invitation to submit to:
  "in words: documents of personal struggles for Queer freedom"
http://transdada2.blogspot.com/

In the last year we have seen the rise of Queer marriage,  Queer civil
rights, global pride, and acts of civil disobedience for and in the
Queer community.

At the same time Queer activist have been murdered, jailed and silenced.

Though there are various points of oppression, from colonialist laws
still in existence, legislation of separate - but equal, unimagined
acts of homophobia, transphobia, AIDs/ HIV discrimination, xenophobia,
racism, sexism, and misogamy; the struggle still continues; sometimes
on a personal level, and at other times within the legal and
legislative system.

For the most part the voices we hear are on news clips. It time for all
the voices and all the words of personal acts of freedom to be heard.

If you identify as or with Queer, gay, trans, bisexual, lesbian,
intersex, or just discriminated against in multiple systems of
institutionalized oppressions,  submit* your: notes, essays,
interviews, letters, documents, rants, request for support, emergency
action needs or poems** to: terra1@sonic.net

Hi all: this message is on the fly: I'm inviting people over for a potluck this Friday evening, 'round 7pm, suggested by Kevin Thurston. Our address is

19 Murdock Road

Take Charles Street North
Right on Stevenson Lane (gas station to left)
left on Rodgers Forge Road
Right on Blenheim
Right on Murdock

Go all the way to the end of the block. House is on the lefty.

I'm interested in knowing what everyone thinks about perhaps documenting or at least archiving the kinds of things we're doing, literary-wise. I know there are many disparate literary groups in the area, and putting together an archive of our materials and documents, but also documenting our actions, is very important since we don't want to be brushed under the carpet of a literary heritage gone missing. I've started collecting books from around the country from small presses, but it's time we put our books/documents together to prove there is something worthy happening in Baltimore.

Let's talk about putting together a library, a space for this library, which everyone is welcome to see and to add onto. Let's talk about how we would do such documenting (video/correpondence/photographs/etc.) I think a panel would be helpful, I think a reading series that is all inclusive (i.e. each press invites readers inividually to read on the same nights while opening a dialogue with each other...)

I know I'm missing a lot but hopefully this dinner and this thread will open up some ideas, bring some people in to help with this issue.

My Best,

Christophe Casamassima

    NEW! Another MP3 track from dred-i!


    author: dred-i

Also peep out these tracks:

"Secrets to Walking on Water"
  http://seattle.indymedia.org/en/2004/06/240972.shtml

"Way of Life"
  http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2004/06/290540.shtml

"Temple to Fear (Flies in the Buttermilk)"
feat. Mumia Abu-Jamal and Omowali Imani

 http://publish.seattle.indymedia.org/en/2004/06/240856.shtml

This track was first made in 1997. We sampled part of Mumia from the CD
"All Things Censored" and a poem by Omowali Imani called "Strange Gods"
and made a hip-hop track to bring it all together. It's called "Temple
to Fear (Flies in the Buttermilk)".

Please copy, master, and distribute this for Mumia and all political
prisoners. And get a copy of his new book "We Want Freedom".

We have even more cuts and we are available for live shows (seriosu
inquiries only). We're also seeking serious like-minded people to help
us free the minds of the hip-hop nation and overthrow the rap industry.

"Did You Beat Up Any Niggahs Lately?"
feat. Malcolm X and Fred Hampton Sr.
  http://publish.seattle.indymedia.org/en/2004/06/240832.shtml

This is the latest track from dred-I, it's called "What Iz (Hip-Hop)".

SCOTT STRUMAN & JANE SPRAGUE

Spoken Word Salon: Third Thursdays Zoey's Cafe
7:30pm July 15

Local literary luminary lunatic & Winona Ryder
fanatic Scott Struman is leaving us for somewhere
between Yosemite & Fresno while Taos Circus Pal and
math fiend Jane Sprague has just settled nearby from
Ithaca NY. Both will feature Thursday July 15 at Spoken
Word Salon at Zoey's Cafe. Free but we pass the hat.

Scott, a college-educated dishwasher and a member of
Joan Raymund's poetry workshop in Ojai for several
years, has had poems published in Rivertalk, The
Northridge Review, ARTLIFE, Poetry Motel, The Santa
Barbara Independent, Many Mountains Moving, The
Spokane Review, Wavelength, Stained Sheets, and Last
Tangos. Raised in Northridge, Scott has lived in
Camarillo since 1993.

Jane Sprague's poems have been published in numerous
print and online magazines including kultureflash,
Columbia Poetry Review, ecopoetics, Kiosk, Shampoo,
Can We Have Our Ball Back? and others. Her reviews
appear in Rain Taxi, Jacket, the Poetry Project Newsletter and other =
journals. She
publishes Palm Press, www.palmpress.org , and produced the West End =
Reading Series in Ithaca, NY until relocating to the strange still =
breakwater of Long Beach, California.

seems closed but hey  wait up you only put add up july 4 right many
friends ande acquaintances on this gallery i'd love to join the party
wanted to backchannel but knew not how



this will be a poem  soon or is               based on lautreamont

"the novel is a false genre, because it describes the passions for their
own sake: the moral conclusion is absent.....just to describe the passion
is nothing .....the pot consoles mankind."


out of context    when  novels and poetry still competed somewhat

Launched at Incubation 3 last Monday, Sophia by Alan Sondheim

Sophia; Sondheim, Alan; 2004; ISBN 1 84254 583 3; A4 portrait; 36 pp; =
=A33.75 incl post in UK - email writersforum@britishlibrary.net for =

Orders received will be post tomorrow

*

Introduction to Alan Sondheim / Lawrence Upton



Alan Sondheim's output is varied and energetically learned: much music, =
films, graphics, performance and writing.

And theory..

And pedagogy.

For rough brevity, I shall call it all writing.

His writing exploits the plasticity of natural and machine language and =
other codes, unpicking seams of system front ends; and he is a stylist, =
even with system-mediated text, the style in appropriateness rather than =
familiarity. He writes - in his writing as writing - through avatars, =
one at least called alan; and any narrative you construct will soon be =
as reliable as a very loose handrail. It's ideal writing for anyone who =
has ever been subject or object of statements like "that isn't like you" =
or "now I am seeing another side of you" and not worried.

He's funny, but it's not punchline humour; and it can be difficult to =
know how to receive it, it destabilises.

The writing comes at stand up speed, largely via email, in an inversion =
of the bureaucrat's need-to-know, assuming we all do need to know. These =
are emails which stay emails. This is it. Sent, soon after being =
written, to a variety of internet contexts.

He projects and expands and redirects personal need, working through it =
intensely, hunger amidst insubstantial plenty, where the material is =
imaginary.

Not writing for web-content nor any purpose other than its own; not =
delivery of contentment or white space infill, nor the covering of white =
noise. Writing as individuation: I existed on continuous rewrite. I =
lived naked on the net.

Here is a sample, from shining upwards

the face in which epiphany is produced and which appeals to me, mirage =
of breath, perhaps I am doing this for you, an epiphany. there is always =
epiphany, talk, sleep, breath, 'a state of _phantasmic exaltation_ forms =
the typical introduction of the organism from space, all breath and =
exaltation.' the midst of the grasping, the organisms, saying, ending in =
ellipsis ... and the exaltation of violence which makes a man, a man. =
among those macroscopic moments of exaltation are emotions.

[.]

but the interior may be lifted into exaltation, this state, i have said =
to you, this state of the organism, this epiphany when worlds ..=20

a temporal detumescence or slackening - an order associated, if you =
will, with an end, the resulting detumescence partaking of defuge

<cut>

And of that word, defuge, he writes elsewhere:

fetishization transformed into discard, disgust, the image no longer =
working, _that_ body used up in masturbation. It is so common that a =
word is necessary here, the _defuge,_ defuse / refuge / deluge / refuse, =
de-light, de-flower. Rhyme patterns, frames, defuges; it is the defuge =
that draws the poem forward beyond return

Literary territory; but in a place occasioned through computers, where =
what is familiar is parodic, undermined / undermining as it is =
manifested.

Ongoing learning outputs the topology of output, cyborgian persistence =
creating itself in process awareness - an idiosyncratic use of "cyborg"; =
but, for a Turing test, we don't need to know about the physical layer =
of the platform the ideas and creativity run on.

Being on line involves awareness that not only is I an other, but is =
also self-aware of being a confederation of awarenesses of which there =
is neither one spokesperson nor border.

Yet the net is glamorous, sans merci, and we remain animals, many alone =
and palely loitering during downtime. I write myself into existence and =
write myself out of existence.

Yet of the many things I like about Alan Sondheim's imaginative writing =
is the acceptance of and writing with human physicality - the mammal =
with a machine; the self-prostheticised, making intellect.

In that sense, the net, Sondheim's net, is a potential polity in which, =
if one found oneself clicking with apparent reality, one might rewrite =
some of the script!

Usually what I talk about is "seamless virtual reality," and for an =
example, I say just look around us now - if we only knew the safeword, =
the keyword, we'd be back in the real world - in the meantime we're =
stuck with this. This is a real possibility with constantly exploding =
bandwidth; more likely, we'll be entangled in some monstrous corporate =
enterprise, with advertising banners all over the place, as if we were =
permanently living in Times Square. Or a third possibility, that we'd be =
bound by our own sexual energies, eternally fulfilled - until the =
money's gone...

Incubation is an ideal environment for such a challenging creative =
confederation. Ladies and Gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Alan =
Sondheim

Hi All,

I'm looking for a book akin to Queneau's Excersies in Style, with its =
wide-range of styles, which leans more heavily toward poetry. The book =
would be used in my poetry class. Suggestions?

Thanks.

hi all,
i have a fairly new political poem that friends are finding worthy and i'd
like to publish it, but by the time i send it out, even if it gets accepted,
it will be much later than november (it's an anti-bush poem called "rant for
gorgeous george"---much too long to post to the list, and probably
inappropriate).  i guess it will still be relevant after the election, but
it's best time is now. does anyone know of a place---maybe online would be
best---where things happen fast and a poem with a sell-by date might have a
chance of finding a home? backchannel is fine, waldreid@earthlink.net.
thanks very much.

Video records soldier's plans to join al-Qaida

Thursday, May 13, 2004

By MIKE BARBER
SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER REPORTER

FORT LEWIS -- Army Spc. Ryan Anderson talked with his lawyer and wrote
on a notepad yesterday, but didn't look up at the screen showing an
undercover video of his meeting near the Space Needle in February with
two federal investigators posing as al-Qaida terrorist recruiters.

In the 58-minute recording made inside a vehicle, with about a minute
censored for security reasons, Anderson, 26, of Lynnwood is shown
volunteering ideas on how to defeat U.S. military vehicles and kill
soldiers, sharing military documents, making plans to desert and join
al-Qaida, and his reasons for it all.

"While I love my homeland, I believe the leaders have taken this
horrible road. I have no belief in what the American Army has asked me
to do. They have taken me from my family and sent me to die," Anderson
said on the video, which was shown in a courtroom at this Army base
yesterday.

"I joined the National Guard because they said I won't go over and fight
-- I will fight at home," he said.

But Anderson, a convert to Islam, said he would not fight overseas
against "brother" Muslims. "I am very upset about that," he said. "I
love my country, but I fear my government."

On the video, Anderson gives Jordanian ancestry on his mother's side of
the family as a motivation for defecting, claiming he was sickened when
fellow soldiers denigrated Arabs and Muslims without reprimand.

"I believe you are what Americans would call al-Qaida," Anderson tells
the agents. When they ask why they should trust him, he said: "If I walk
away, I'm wanted in the country. It's called AWOL or desertion. If I
leave, I cannot come back."

Anderson, a member of a tank crew with the state National Guard's 81st
Armor Division that deployed to Iraq in March, was arrested in February
after he allegedly tried to pass information to undercover Army
investigators. He is charged with five counts of trying to communicate
with terrorists.

Anderson seemed relaxed yesterday. He was dressed in a desert-camouflage
uniform and wore black-rimmed glasses. He is appearing at an Article 32
hearing, similar to a grand jury in the civilian legal system except
that Anderson can be present and cross-examine witnesses.
Recommendations will be made to Lt. Gen. Edward Soriano, Fort Lewis
commander, who will decide whether to convene a court-martial and
whether charges will carry the death penalty.

Anderson, a 2002 Washington State University graduate in military
history, was known to high school classmates in Lynnwood for his
Christian and paramilitary enthusiasm and profuse letter writing to
newspapers. Then he embraced his version of Islam and kept his ideas
flowing on Internet forums.

One Internet forum sparked the case against him.

As the first witness, Shannen Rossmiller, a city judge in Conrad, Mont.,
described yesterday how she linked the name and e-mail address of Amir
Abdul Rashid on the Web site to Anderson.

Under questioning and cross-examination, Rossmiller said she is a member
of 7/Seas.net, a group of seven amateur "counterintelligence"
Web-surfing hobbyists tracking terrorist activity and providing
information to the government. Its members include four in the United
States, one in Australia, one in Indonesia and another in Canada,
Rossmiller said.

She told investigating officer Col. Patrick Reinert she saw a posting
from "Rashid" after visiting a site that carries a graphic of Osama bin
Laden and an American flag burning. She began a dialogue because "he was
curious whether a brother fighting on the wrong side could join or defect."

"Soon very soon I will have the opportunity to take my own end of the
struggle to those who oppress us, to the next level," a message from
"Rashid" read.

Rossmiller played along for several months until January, performing a
string of Internet searches to link Rashid to Anderson. She contacted
the Homeland Security Department, which put her in touch with the FBI
and U.S. Army Military Intelligence agents.

Special agent Ricardo Romero from the 902nd Military Intelligence Group
at Fort Meade, Md., testified that he met undercover with Anderson on
Feb. 8 in Lakewood and Feb. 9 at the Seattle Center. Romero said he
posed as an al-Qaida recruiter.

He also contacted Anderson by cell phone text messaging, giving a
Detroit area code because the city is home to many Muslim Americans. "I
hope you aren't FBI or NSA (National Security Agency) or something," a
cautious Anderson reportedly said.

"If you are who you say you are and things go where I think they are
going, I will be unwelcome in the only land I've ever known as home,
never to see my parents again," another message says.

In the undercover video, Anderson seemingly volunteers information
freely, with little prompting, pulling his weapons card, military ID and
others for Ramon to photograph. Talking in great detail, Anderson on the
video produced literature about the M1A1 battle tank and how to defeat
it and the kill the soldiers inside.

Among those at Anderson's hearing was Capt. James Yee, 36, recently
restored to duty at Fort Lewis after successfully defending himself in a
court-martial that grew out of his arrest in September as a suspect in
an espionage ring at Guantanamo Bay.

Yee talked with soldiers and watched the proceedings but declined to
comment.

Frogs Caught Stealing Dick Cheney's Iraq Oil Money Through U.N. Program:
By Columbine Lynchpin



They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

News from Cuneiform:
http://www.cuneiformpress.com/

Cuneiform Press is pleased to announce the publication of Alan Loney's  =
Meditatio : the printer printed : manifesto with an introduction by =
Steve Clay of Granary Books.

ALAN LONEY is the author of eight books of poetry; his dear Mondrian, =
won the New Zealand Book Awards prize in 1977. For several years he =
edited the magazine A Brief Description of the Whole World; as printer =
and publisher he has operated Hawk Press, Black Light Press and The =
Holloway Press. The Writers Group brought out Reading | Saying | Making: =
Selected Essays in 2001. Presently Loney lives in Australia. Robert =
Creeley writes "Alan Loney's work has always been at the cutting edge of =
New Zealand's place in world literature."=20

As Steve Clay rightfully notes in his introduction, this book is sure to =
take its place among landmark titles such as Clifford Burke's Printing =
Poetry (1980) and Harry Duncan's Doors of Perception (1983). This book =
is both essential, and enjoyable reading for book artists, printers and =
poets alike.

Penny Griffith writes, "Meditatio is a graceful reconsideration of the =
role of typography in relation to art, the reader, and the world of the =
book and reading."=20

This book was produced in an edition of 200, and available for the very =
reasonable cost of $10.00 per copy (including S & H in the United =
States. For international orders, please add $3.00.

Order directly from:

[this is a heads up for everyone on these lists.  internet petitions
are pretty iffy but I think this is an important document to generate
regardless of its actual effect on policy decisions.  to compile how we
as literary communities regard Coach House Press & its contribution to
literature small press publishing.  ~mIEKAL]


Subject: Save the Coach House: A Petition

As many of you know, Coach House has been fighting to save its home.
Our landlord, Campus Co-op Residence Inc., plans to expand its own
property, and this development directly threatens the buildings that
Coach House has occupied for forty years.

However, we have just received word that we're on the list for
recommendation for historical designation. They'll vote on it at city
council next week. Now, this is only the first stage. After city
designation (which is certainly not guaranteed), we need provincial
designation, and then we need to work with Co-op to make things work
well for both of us. This is a great start, but we still need your
support!

So we're asking you to please sign our petition, and to pass it along
to anyone else you think might like to help. Check it out at:

www.chbooks.com/savech/view.php

For more information, check our website, www.chbooks.com/savech.

We also invite you to join us for an open house on Thursday, July 29,
between 3 and 8 p.m. There will burgers, beer and, of course, books. As
well as guided tours for new visitors and, at 5:30, some rabble-rousing.

Questions? Comments? Email savecoachhouse@chbooks.com.

Thanks so much for your support!

Sniffing from St Pancras & out, little connectivity in evidence by the
trackside of the Nottingham train - go figure.

How are you and the rest of Europe?

nightmare placed at the end

of dreaming then working back towards the dream
of human hatred then there's a moment of total extinction
hieroglyphics of love and war
americans and the prison of abu ghraib
they'll tear it down to be sure
i reduced with sorensen and down to 5 frames a second
   and still it's 22 megabytes
that's the problem with it
the bulk of witnessing, no matter how distorted
   you can just about make out the face and its expressions
they're nameless
it's still the bulk of witnessing
i took a break from war and went and made these pieces
i just took a break and worked on something else
i'm back and writing this with these pieces
they were placed at the beginning, i edited
i placed them at the end

These are the heros and Heroines:

    R. Campbell, Republican, CO  "NAY"

    R. Chafee, Republican, RI     "NAY"=20

    R. Collins,  Republican, ME    "NAY"

    I. Jeffords, Independent, VT "NAY"

    J. McCain, Republican, AZ    "NAY"=20

    R. Snowe, Republican, ME   "NAY"

    J. Sununu, Republican, NH   "NAY"

There were others, of course, those in the Senate who voted conscience =
not party convictions. =20

But these, in my estimation, made a major difference in the bid to =
defeat president Bush's efforts to create an amendment to the U.S. =
Constitution to ban same sex marriages. =20

Those of us who intend to honor article XIV of the Constitution see =
those words as guaranteeing the rights and privileges to all =
citizens...regardless of sexual orientation, etc. etc. etc. =20

Marriage is both a privilege granted by the state and a right of the =
"liberty" of citizenry, irrespective of ones gender. =20

Article XIV.=20
Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and =
subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States =
and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any =
law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the =
United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, =
or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within =
its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.=20

**********************************************************************

This fight is far from over, if one reads Senator Frists words following =
the defeat on Wednesday. =20

Perhaps it's time for the state of Tennessee to look at changing =
senators? =20

Gerald,

I teach at John Carroll U, in Cleveland's East side.  Poetry
happens all over: Mac's Backs Paperbacks in Cleveland Heights
is a good place (Suzanne DeGaetano is a manager there and
huge supporter of poetry, on the Poets and Writers League of
Greater Cleveland, which is a good site to check out because
they list all the main events).  Of course, my humble
institution sponsors a half dozen readings a year, though
this year we're already all booked.

Best to you,

Phil Metres

Folks,

Just wanted to let people know about two upcoming readings in
Cambridge MA and NYC, for those interested.  I'll be
performing some texts from my translation of Lev
Rubinstein's "Catalogue of Comedic Novelties," which Mr.
Silliman chatted up on his blog as one of them important
poetry books of the year.  It should be fun.  Ronald Reagan
might be there.

Rhizomes Issue 8, Spring 2004:  Retro-Futures

Why was the future of the 1950s and 1960s, as projected in
design, so fanciful? Why do contemporary trends in design
so often embody neo-traditional and/or "retro" aesthetics?
Why do the radical futures of the past seem so na=EFve, while
the stale futures of today seem so sensible?  In seeking
possible answers to these questions, more general
questions about culture and temporality emerge: What did
the future mean in the past?  What will the past mean in the
future?  What do these concerns mean for us right now?
The essays and media reviews in Rhizomes #8,
Retro-Futures, engage issues of future pastness, retro
aesthetics, and various incarnations of technology and
posthumanism.  Essays in Rhizomes Issue 8 include:

=DF "Futurama, Autogeddon: Imagining the Superhighway
from Bel Geddes to Ballard" by Helen J. Burgess looks at
Bel Geddes' narrative of the golden future of the Interstate.
She finds it haunted from the start by the specter of its own
death and its attempt to use this future-perfect to cover over
the ghosts it would leave behind, both human and animal:
the destruction of delicate environments, the ever-present
road-kill, the high-speed car smashes.
=DF "Letters from an Unknown Filmmaker: Chris Marker's
Sans Soleil and the Politics of Memory" by Chuck Tryon
uses the conceit of the traveling filmmaker to suggest a new
way of seeing and thinking not only about our relationship to
images but also about the role of images-cinematic and
otherwise-in producing our experience of time.
=DF "Machinic Rhetoric, Highways and Interpellating Motions"
by Kevin Kuswa moves through a framework of the nation,
the state, and capitalism in order to better understand the
highway machine and its effects in the United States.
=DF "Apocalypse, Ideology, America: Science Fiction and the
Myth of the Post-Apocalyptic Everyday" by Matthew
Wolf-Meyer rereads post-apocalyptic narratives ~V including
Walter M. Miller's A Canticle for Leibowitz, Philip K. Dick's Dr.
Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb, Robert
Heinlein's Farnham's Freehold, and Kim Stanley
Robinson's The Wild Shore ~V as attempts at the isolation of
essentially American ideological formations that, among
other things, project a homogenized American future.
=DF "Counting Sheep: Dolly does Utopia (again)" by Julian
Yates charts the passage of one "idea" that has traveled
from the texts of Renaissance Humanist Thomas More into
a series of contemporary sites in popular culture: the figure
of a speaking sheep, individuated from the flock,
summoned to the table talk of its human masters, and
made to speak the truth about labor.
=DF "Choose Your Own Sexuality: An Adventure in Queer
History" by Brooke M. Campbell uses the model of a
hypertext "choose your own adventure" as an experiment in
queer metahistory. Hypertext, she argues, sheds the dead
weight of additive models and embraces and the internal
disintegration of traditional history.
=DF "The Countdown of Time and the Practice of Everyday Life"
by Hai Ren examines the relationship between time-telling
and the practice of everyday life in contemporary China by
focusing on the historical process of the Hong Kong
countdown in the 1990s.
=DF In "Time and the Fragmented Subject in Minority Report,"
Martin Hall uses the Lacanian  mirror stage and the future
anterior register to explore how the film establishes
discourses around the dichotomy of fixed or fragmented
subjects.
=DF "Zones of Morbidity" by Jamie Skye Bianco tracks a broad
swath of politics, histories, texts, policies, and theoretics in
order to allow several views of an emergent politic: the
production of morbidity for profit and living by privatized
subscription.

Books I like and the reasons why -


I've been traveling and working for the past couple of months; here's the
latest - texts and others I'm fascinated by -

Google, The Missing Manual, Sarah Milstein and Rael Dornfest, O'Reilly:
This is the third book on Google help that O'Reilly's published, and for
most people, this is by far the best. Google is expanding, building a
search empire, for better or worse; there are all sorts of experimental
Google searches, as well as an enormous number of configurable options. I
use Google, because it's clean, fast, and hasn't disappointed me - and
this is probably the best guide out there. You don't have to know
programming, by the way, to use this. And like all O'Reilly books (well,
almost all of them), it's well-written, interesting reading, with no
fluff.

destruction in art, Bob Cobbing, writers forum
(writersforum@britishlibrary.net). I'm not all that interested in concrete
poetry and/or destruction art, but this work is of great interest, a
series of 21 prints of Cobbing's Typestract One and the events program for
The Destruction of Art Symposium - all increasingly mangled, none of them
readable. The prints blur to almost black. I'm reminded of Latham's Skoob,
the work of Dom Sylvester Houedard (who has had an interesting career - do
a Google search) - and, most recently, Gerhardt Richter's photographic
sequences of sections of his paintings. In all of this material there's a
sense of loss, the attempt for something else to 'emerge' or 'give,' and
in general a melancholia related to the violence of everyday life. Check
this out.

On the other hand, if you want an amazing Cobbing / Peter Mayer work, ask
for concerning concrete poetry, from the same press (run by Lawrence Upton
at the least!). This book, also inexpensively produced, is a reprint from
1978, and includes the work of a number of people, from John Furnival
through Porfirius Optatianus. But what makes it remarkable are the
contents: chapters on 'The Term Concrete,' 'Some Historical Statements and
Manifestos,' 'On Semantic Poetry,' 'Some Myths of Concrete Poetry,' two
chronologies of visual and sound poetry, and so forth. Wonderful!

EDA: An Anthology of Contemporary Turkish Poetry, edited by Murat
Nemer-Nejat, Talisman House Publishers, is spectacular. I knew nothing of
these poets, but the themes and styles, at least for me, are unique. I
tested it on my father, who's 90 and reads history and literature
incessantly, and he also was fascinated. I love Sami Baydar and Lale
Muldur's works - but it all reads well. I can't tell of course how good
the translations are, but the works are excellent in English as well.

Eden Eden Eden, Pierre Guyotat, Creation Books. I'd not read Guyotat's
work before, so you're probably far ahead of me. Needless to say, it
resonates in its apothecaries of relentless sexuality and violence,
somewhat reminiscent of Kenji Siratori's work (see below). Stylistically
most of it runs on gerunds and participles; I've never read anything like
it. If there's a writing degree zero, this is it. Do check it out. It was
originally published in French in 1970, by the way.

Crum, The Novel, Lee Maynard, Vandalia Press. Crum had a population of 219
in West Virginia, for real; the book is part fiction, part memoir, and if
you ever want to understand West Virginia or for that matter, any American
rural/mining area, begin here. It resonates. It was banned in Crum and
shouldn't have been. It's wonderful.

The Ethics of the Dust: Ten Lectures to Little Housewives on The Elements
of Crystallisation, by John Ruskin, 2nd edition, 1877. This is one of the
truly weirdest books I've ever come across, and that's saying a lot. In
his later years, Ruskin fell in love with a nine-year-old girl; the rest
is history, both found and lost. The book is a summary of his beliefs in
terms of crystallization (reminding one of Stendhal in the matter, but not
in manner or content) - if you ever see a copy, pick it up.

Likewise, Prophetic Writings of Lady Eleanor Davies, edited by Esther S.
Cope, Oxford. Mid-seventeenth century writings, the like of which, being
outside the kin and ken, I've never come across; apparently there were
other prophets of the time. The language is various and strange. As the
introduction says, 'Some sentences lack subjects or verbs' and the whole
is rather breathless and Beat Generationist by loose default. Again, if
you see it...

The Knapsack, edited by Herbert Read, 1939, is one of my favorite small
books, containing a plethora of literary excerpts that somehow match my
taste; it's a tiny book, but one of the few anthologies I can read over
and over again.

Just finished Volney's Ruins, by the way - again, look for it.

D.C. Lau's translations of Confucius and Mencius are excellent, by the way
- I'm using them with a slow-reading list I'm on, dealing with Chinese
classical philosophy.

HUMAN_WORMS, Kenji Siratori, iUniverse Inc. is a beautiful book. I've been
reading Kenji's works for a long time; at one point, I was modifying
texts he was emailing on. Much of his writing, including this, sounds like
uncompromising cyberpunk cutup, but it isn't; in fact, I have no idea how
it's written. I love it for that. Recently, Jim Reith wrote a program for
me that will take a text, place the words in an array, and access them
according to an arbitrary mathematical function that I can define. It's
the closest I get to Kenji's style myself, but his work is far denser, and
darker in furious post-Bladerunner style. This particular work is his most
advanced - and beautiful - to date. Phrases are repeated - 'hunting for
the grotesque WEB' for example - these are broken and recombined like an
insane DNA. If you're getting one Siratori book - and you should - this is
the one.

I have three Sheila Murphy books here - she's one of the most interesting
'subliminal' poets around - by which I mean everything is beneath the
surface of what appears in wildly various styles - but all related - of
the three - Green Tea With Ginger (Potes and Poets) - Letters to
Unfinished J. (Green Integer) - and Concentricity (Pleasure Boat Studio) -
I prefer the second _and its italics_ - or the third - of which on the
back cover John Tritica references the 'tone complexion' and 'promenade of
images' - which he also puts into quotations - it that, the centrifugal
force as if the sections split apart - they don't - cerebellar sparks of
adjacency but widely disparate imagery/imaginary -

At this point I'd also like to mention in passing -

The wryting list, co-moderated by Ryan Whyte and myself (the descendent of
the old fiction-of-philosophy list that I started circa 1994-5) - some of
the best experimental writing I've seen is there -

Sophia - my sophia.txt, published by Writers Forum or writers forum just a
few days ago - this is the main theory/philosophical text I've written -
one might be interested -

The Compaq Presario notebook I bought a short while ago with the Athlon
3000 64-bit processor - cool and fast and the wireless _reaches_ - I've
been using it for production and it responds well -

The Zaurus 5500 linux-based PDA I've used for almost the past year - this
is an incredible mini-computer - it runs Mathematica-like programs, full
linux, perl, anything you want to put on it - with a wireless card Kismet
is great on it - etc. -

Peter Krapp's Deja Vu: Aberrations of Cultural Memory, Minnesota - I'm
still in process of reading this and I've not been focusing all that well
(with the residency at West Virginia University followed by the Incubation
Conference at Nottingham) - but I'll cover this - I asked for a review
copy - an outstanding chapter on Heiner Muller - more later -

[Karl, your comments below are a remarkable piece of writing, do you=20
mind if I forward
it to a couple lists including poetics & spidertangle?  --mIEKAL]


I'd like to join those who have signed this petition, and to stress a
few points that have not been made or that may not be noticed. =A0
=A0
I visited Toronto frequently during the 1970s, often on trips that
included New York City as well. At that time, Toronto had a healthier
and more energetic experimental literature scene than the Big Apple.
That was no small accomplishment. Coach House Press was essential to
the city's vigor and creativity in many ways, as it was to the
development of publishing and even of print technology. =A0
=A0
During the 1960s, those of us interested in poetry read books published
by City Lights (books without cover graphics and with saddle stitched
bindings) and by New Directions (books that had black and white photos
on their covers, but otherwise were incredibly plain by today's
standards). I and a reasonably large number of publishers began
publishing books on mimeo machines, with City Lights and New Directions
as our models. In the 70s, many of us moved to offset production. In
this period, two new models were added: Black Sparrow and Coach House. =A0=

=A0
The shift to offset had many ramifications, and Coach House was more of
a guiding light for them than the other three presses. Its
accomplishments included the following: =A0
=A0
1. It was part of a cooperative ecosystem which included other presses,
such as House of Anansi and Underwhich Editions. The eccosystem
fostered cooperation such as publishers had probably never seen before
and may not have seen since. =A0
=A0
2. The informal, personal, face to face millieu of 427 Huron Street
(rear) did not simply house offices and presses, it fostered the
exchange of ideas, the development of techniques, the cultivation of
mutual aid and support, constructive debate, and the sense of
enthusiasm and optimism necessary for the scene in Toronto, and for its
extension into other cities. =A0
=A0
3. The different aspects of production never got too far away from each
other: those who wrote got a sense of how books were made; those who
printed could work out production problems with the authors; etc. Books
in this environment did not simply become consumer commodities but
mediums of respectful exchange and encouragement. =A0
=A0
4. The printers at Coach House were as much on the leading edge of the
technology of their craft as were those whose work they published. I
visited Coach House from Milwaukee, which is universally acknowledged
as the printing capitol of the world. At home in that city, printers
discussed such methods as random dot color separation, but generally
just left it at the talking stage. Stan Bevington and other people at
Coach House actually tried these methods out, and improvised variations
on them. =A0
=A0
5. In the move from mimeo to offset, Coach House was not simply a model
of how to produce books (from writing to editing to printing), it also
did as much as any publisher in North America to create the mid-sized
press: a type of publishing venture with the resources to produce books
that could be carried in bookstores and sold to libraries, but not be
as dependant on massive funding as commercial publishers or accademic
institutions. This is the area of publishing from which virtually all
new poetry comes at the present time, and the way it will have to be
done in the forseable future. =A0
=A0
6. Coach House brought Canadian literature to world attention at a time
when even Canadians doubted that it could be done. Canada Council
funding assisted in this, but if its funds had not been inteligently
used, as they were at Coach House, they would have been wasted. Some
celebrities such as Michael Ondatjee and Margaret Atwood were among
those published in this dispensation; but individual celebrity can't
compare with the way that the milieu of which Coach House was the
center put Canada on the world map as an equal partner with and in some
ways a leader of, work done in the U.S., parts of Latin America, and
Europe. No other Canadian arts organization has done anything close to
that. It is surprising to me that after all these years (and
remembering how important it was for Canadians to assert their
independence at the time) that anyone should seriously propose to tear
down the Coach House buildings. Those buildings literally helped shape
what went on inside them, and they cannot be replaced. =A0
=A0
I had the good fortune to visit Coach House frequently enough during
this period. I also had the good fortune to publish more of bpNichol's
books and audio tapes than anyone outside of Canada, to engage in
cooperative projects with Nichol, to set up the first web site devoted
to his work, to publish other Canadians on a smaller scale, to write
and commission reviews of them and to set up readings for them in the
U.S. I began this for one simple reason: I tried to keep my finger on
the pulse of what was happening at the time, and that was a time when
Toronto, through Coach House, contributed more to the life blood of
English language poetry than any other city of comparable size.=A0
=A0
I can understand how a McDonald's or a Wal-Mart might be culturally
indifferent enough to tear down the building for bottom line reasons.
But that this should be done by a university flies so vehemently and
savagely in the fase of all reason and purpose as to be
incomprehensible. This is like offering advanced courses in self defeat
and self destruction. =A0
=A0
During recent years, there has been a strong resurgence of interest in
what's now called "the mimeo revolution." This includes both scholarly
and popular books on the publications of the 1960s, and also on the
places from whence it came, such as the coffee houses on Manhattan's
Lower East Side, and biographies of those who participated in it.
Surely within a decade the change in publishing of which Coach House
was at the leading edge will also become the subject of such attention.
How foolish will the Univeristy look then, when it has to admit that it
threw away its major asset for nothing? =A0
=A0
The Coach House could be integrated into the new building program, and
into many activities which the University sponsors. This could be
greatly cost efficient in a period of a few years. =A0
=A0
If no one in the city government or University will listen to the pleas
of the older signers of this petition, I would like to ask the students
themselves to join in support of keeping Canada's greatest literary
treasure from being snuffed. For those of you who are now students,
this is not only your heritage, but an important part of your future. =A0=

Dear Friends: Recently Yusef Komunyakaa, Martín
Espada, Nathalie Handal, and I returned from Santiago,
Chile as official delegates for the Centenary of
Neruda. It was an extraordinary program involving a
train ride to Neruda's home in Parral. The special
train carried leading South American poets like
Ernesto Cardenal, Antonio Skármeta, and the Chilean
President Lagos. We also went to Neruda's home in Isla
Negra and shot a documentary on Neruda and September
11, 1973. There was a reading at the Universidad Diego
Portales featuring Yusef, Martín, and Raúl Zurita.
More information, articles, and photos at

Please join us for the launch of Jeet Thayil's new
collection from Rattapallax Press and Penguin Books
India:

Jeet Thayil/Book Launch Reading & Party. July 21, 7pm,
Drink Me Café, 620 E. 6th St.; B/ Ave. B & C, NYC

“I revel in Jeet Thayil's poetry. He seems to be one
of the most contemporary writers I know, and
contemporary precisely because he has such command of
the poetic and historical past, and because his
invented language has such depth, archeological
richness, and reality. The staying power here and the
imaginative strength, which allows the soul to be
forever balanced on the cusp of the inner and outer
worlds, are nothing short of remarkable.” -- Vijay
Seshadri

Date: Fri, 16 Jul 2004 03:32:47 -0700 (PDT)

A new essay by Robert Mueller, which is an original publication of the
Electronic Poetry Center at the Barbara Guest home page, treats of two
poems by Barbara Guest while ranging widely through pertinent sources,
primarily the work of Wittgenstein, but also significant texts in
ancient Greek, Latin and French as well as other works in English.
Mr. Mueller has a Ph.D. in comparative literature from Brown
University and lives in New York City.  His published writings
included poems and essays of critical scholarship.

Wittgenstein: Reading into Wittgenstein into Two Poems of Unusual
Consequence and Vibrancy

Thanks much.

Yours,

Ah dear Alan

day after day I open my e-mail and there is yet another, and another, poem
by you. I love your poems because they are so unmemorable, you have
certainly missed a vocation in becoming some kind of advisor to groups like
MacDonalds, you are the saint of disposable verse, even the great McGonagall
must tremble in the shades at the mention of your name. You seem to be a
really nice guy, I know one or two people who've met you and they convey
that impression, I like your politics, I'm with you on that, but why oh why
do you not realise that your project itself is the narcissistic voice of the
ego-driven consumer - I hear nobody in your poems but Alan (not alan) and
the all that I hear tells me nothing about that Alan except for the
intensity of its ego.

I might also ask what you are doing deriving funding and support from the
tRAce project - arts funding in the English East Midlands (where tRAce is
based) is minimal and that monies are being diverted to you or Mark Amerika
when here in Leicester there isn't a proper venue for poetry readings. The
arts scene here is a total fuck-up - a few people manipulate the grants
scene, the only decent poetry mag from here is my own A Chide's Alphabet,
into which the very same people who wouldn't consider giving it support
would jump at the chance of inclusion. Brownnosers comes to mind.

Anyhow, dear Alan, I hope your sense of eminence isn't offended by my
addressing you thus, write fewer, not more, poems, get out of the ego-trip,
concentrate, aim the word-lens.

Best

Dave

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and taverns!),
utilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented forms. We
will explore the structural possibilities of language to ultimately answer
the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning and practiced
poets will generate lots of original writing from this full day of language
play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye with which to
revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist who has performed and taught
extensively around the country. Her work has appeared in Paterson Literary
Review, Painted Bride Quarterly, Schuylkill Valley Journal of the Arts, Mad
Poets Review, and La Petite Zine. She also has a CD titled notspeak.

I thought about this and can only say, welcome, Alan, to these shores, as
tightly bound, wound-up, fraught they are. When I first read this email
quoted below, I was with David: yes, monies on the UK poetry scene are
tight but this sort of position employing foreign nationals is very
commonplace, I think. David's questions are best addressed to tRace as to
who they fund and why.

intensity of its ego.

I might also ask what you are doing deriving funding and support from the
tRAce project - arts funding in the English East Midlands (where tRAce is
based) is minimal and that monies are being diverted to you or Mark Amerika
when here in Leicester there isn't a proper venue for poetry readings. The
arts scene here is a total fuck-up - a few people manipulate the grants
scene, the only decent poetry mag from here is my own A Chide's Alphabet,
into which the very same people who wouldn't consider giving it support
would jump at the chance of inclusion. Brownnosers comes to mind.

Anyhow, dear Alan, I hope your sense of eminence isn't offended by my
addressing you thus, write fewer, not more, poems, get out of the ego-trip,
concentrate, aim the word-lens.

Best

This would be more comical, to my mind, if this former Trotskyite (not,
in his case, Trotskyist) & anarchist, one of the more militant attackers
of langpo, had not also been the person with whom I gave my very first
public poetry reading back in 1965.=20

-------------------------------
Bad Poet, Bad Man=20
By Stephen Schwartz=20
The Weekly Standard | July 19, 2004


THE CHILEAN WRITER Pablo Neruda is "the greatest poet of the twentieth
century--in any language." Or so said Gabriel Garc=EDa M=E1rquez, in a =
line
recently repeated by the Washington Post and several other American
publications. Readers in the United States seem destined to have Neruda
thrust upon them every few years, much as the cicadas return to whine
and roar up and down the East Coast. The excuse this time is the
centennial of Neruda's birth on July 12, 1904.=20

There is probably no more chance of halting this current binge of Neruda
worship than there is of banishing the cicadas, but, still, the truth
does need to be said: Pablo Neruda was a bad writer and a bad man. His
main public is located not in the Spanish-speaking nations but in the
Anglo-European countries, and his reputation derives almost entirely
from the iconic place he once occupied in politics--which is to say,
he's "the greatest poet of the twentieth century" because he was a
Stalinist at exactly the right moment, and not because of his poetry,
which is doggerel.

Yes, his work is still plagiarized by teenage boys in Latin America, who
see his Twenty Love Poems and a Desperate Song and figure there is
nothing wrong with borrowing from it--just as one poem in the book is
itself stolen from Rabindranath Tagore--and presenting its overwrought
lines to their girlfriends. But if those boys grow up to be serious
writers, they leave Neruda behind.=20

Nonetheless, the American progressive literary caste adores, adulates,
and idolizes Neruda. He found the exact measure of his mediocrity in
Robert Bly, beater of drums and perpetrator of vexingly atrocious verse,
as translator. I admit to feeling a little sympathy for the dead Neruda
once: When I discovered that his political poem Que despierte el
le=F1ador, in which Lincoln represents the Marxist element in the =
history
of the United States, had been done into English by Bly. Awarded a
Soviet "International Peace Prize" for 1950--and there's a phrase that
should provoke considerable thought--the text was published in America
by the Communist party with its title stirringly rendered as Let the
Railsplitter Awake! Actually, Bly's title, I Wish the Woodcutter Would
Wake Up, may be even more revealing.

In 1938, two singular men sat down to compose a statement about the
situation of the global intellect as they then saw it. They wrote, among
other things, "The totalitarian regime of the U.S.S.R., working through
the so-called 'cultural' organizations it controls in other countries,
has spread over the entire world a deep twilight hostile to every sort
of spiritual value. A twilight of filth and blood in which, disguised as
intellectuals and artists, those men steep themselves who have made
servility a career, of lying for pay a custom, and of excuses for crime
a source of pleasure." Nobody more embodied the phenomenon described in
these lines than Pablo Neruda. The description was written by the
surrealist Andr=E9 Breton and the exiled Leon Trotsky.

Whatever may be said of the Trotskyists, neither their leader nor they
themselves ever promoted bad art. And the essayists, authors, and
critics who cleaved to Trotsky, including James T. Farrell, Sidney Hook,
Mary McCarthy, Saul Bellow, Clement Greenberg, Harold Rosenberg, and a
considerable number of others, were inspired by the words of Breton and
Trotsky when, in 1939, some among them helped found the Committee for
Cultural Freedom. Trotsky and his followers rejected the childish
argument that leftist politics makes good writers and that authors of
the right are necessarily heartless and mercenary.=20


THE RISE of Pablo Neruda may be the definitive example of the Soviet
influence on art around the world. Late nineteenth-century poetry in
Spanish was dominated by the inflated rhetoric of Rub=E9n Dar=EDo, on =
whom
Whitman and the French Parnassiens exercised a baleful influence. Then
came the "Generation of '98," the group of extraordinary writers in
Spain who, in the aftermath of that country's defeat in the
Spanish-American war, carried out something comparable to the Imagist
revolution of Pound and his contemporaries--clearing the exaggerated,
gassy vocabulary of Rub=E9n out of the idiom, replacing it by a clean,
spare style as well as a harsh recognition of the realities that had
befallen Spanish society and culture. They included some of the great
modern classics of the language: Unamuno, Azor=EDn, Ortega y Gasset, =
P=EDo
Baroja, and Valle-Incl=E1n.

Above all, Antonio Machado exemplified this new poetic diction in
Spanish. The Generation of '98 had major echoes in Latin America, but
also paved the way for the "Generation of 1927," which comprised a yet
more brilliant constellation of poets, known for an even less cluttered
modernist style: Pedro Salinas, Jorge Guill=E9n, Gerardo Diego, D=E1maso
Alonso, Vicente Aleixandre, Federico Garc=EDa Lorca, Luis Cernuda, =
Rafael
Alberti, Manuel Altolaguirre.=20

To move from the lucid achievement of these extraordinary men to the
pseudo-Whitmanese of Neruda represented an immense step backward for
Spanish poetry; it meant a return to the lazy, overwrought excesses
employed by imitators of Rub=E9n Dar=EDo, without the solid Catholic =
values
and connection to the Nicaraguan landscape found in Rub=E9n and his =
better
disciples (most of them known only among his fellow Nicaraguans).
Everybody who knows Spanish literature recognizes this fact--everybody
except a few academic demagogues and a large number of American
newspaper reviewers, who are still responding to the reputation built
for Neruda by the Soviet machine. The admirers of Neruda are tourists in
their approach to Hispanic literature, like people who attend a flamenco
dance performance and think they have seen Spain--but with a politically
correct edge.

Neruda was a figure promoted to global literary stardom by the creators
and bestowers of the Stalin Peace Prize, which he received in 1953. He
was joined in this role with a group of writers, some of them once very
gifted, whose talents faded when they sold themselves to Moscow. The
best among them as writers, and therefore the worst morally, were the
French ex-surrealist Louis Aragon, who before his communization was
unquestionably the finest young prose stylist in his language, but who
turned into a leaden pedant, authoring poems in praise of the Soviet
secret police, along with his compatriot Paul Eluard, who followed the
same path, endorsing the last Stalinist purges.

The Czech novelist Milan Kundera wrote, "I was shocked when, in 1950,
the great French Communist poet Paul Eluard publicly approved the
hanging of his friend, the Prague writer Zavis Kalandra. . . . When a
great poet praises an execution, it is a blow that shatters our whole
image of the world." Neruda, however, was not a great poet, even though
he praised many executions and even participated in an assassination
plot, while also helping consign anti-Communist leftists to the tender
mercies of Adolf Hitler.



NATURALLY, these details are not to be found in the hagiographic
articles that have poured forth in recent weeks on the occasion of the
Neruda centenary. A few weeks ago, the London Guardian dramatically
evoked Neruda's labors to relocate refugees from the defeated Spanish
Republic. Officiating as a Chilean diplomat in Paris, Neruda assisted in
hiring a ship, the Winnipeg, to convey 2,000 Spanish leftist exiles to
Chile.=20

Adam Feinstein writes, "The Winnipeg left Pauillac, the port of
Bordeaux, on August 4, 1939. Neruda stood on the dock, in his white hat,
alongside his second-wife-to-be Delia del Carril, to wave the boat off.
In the key poem, 'Explico algunas cosas' ('Let Me Explain a Few
Things'), Neruda reveals that he has disowned his previous,
inward-looking self, together with any romantic, unworldly lyricism, and
is now fully committed to his new role of truth-teller and exposer of
the world's injustices."

A charming legend, but one hiding historical truths known in rather
different terms to scholars. Neruda played the role of a reverse
Schindler. Using his status as a diplomat, Neruda made sure that
passports to board the Winnipeg went to refugees who shared his politics
and beliefs, which were those of Joseph Stalin. Rejected refugees were
then condemned to internment or death in France, which fell within a
year into the hands of Hitler's rapidly advancing armies.=20


IN HIS DISTINGUISHED WORK Beyond Death and Exile, Louis Stein notes that
the anarchists and anti-Communists "were given a disproportionately
small share of the available places." A leading Spanish anti-Communist
leftist, Federico Solano Palacio, went further, declaring that some 86
percent of the applications for transportation by anarchists were thrown
out. Solano Palacio specifically cited the example of the Winnipeg. The
Catalan labor historian Josep Peirats wrote in 1993: "Before World War
II stopped all departures, [three ships] sailed to Veracruz, Mexico.
Later on, the Winnipeg sailed to Chile. . . . These trips were
administered by the Communists. . . . They granted or denied passports
[and] strictly screened passengers at points of embarkation. The same
procedure applied to transport to Chile, where Pablo Neruda, the Chilean
poet . . . did the screening."

Neruda's services to Stalin did not end with this sorry episode. In May
1940, the Mexican Communist muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros, in a
preview of a successful assassination three months later, led an armed
attack on the Mexican residence of Trotsky, in which an American guard
was kidnapped and murdered. Siqueiros, facing nine separate criminal
charges, was released on bail. But soon after, Neruda helped arrange for
him to get a Chilean passport. Siqueiros immediately fled Mexico, thus
squelching a major part of the Mexican government's investigation of the
anti-Trotsky conspiracy. For the rest of his life, Neruda expressed his
undiluted pride in this action, which had led to his suspension from the
Chilean diplomatic service.

Neruda never bothered to hide his great enthusiasm for Stalin. Upon the
dictator's death in 1953, he wrote a threnody declaring:


To be men! That is the Stalinist law! . . .=20
We must learn from Stalin=20
his sincere intensity=20
his concrete clarity. . . .=20
Stalin is the noon,=20
the maturity of man and the peoples.=20
Stalinists, Let us bear this title with pride. . . .=20
Stalinist workers, clerks, women take care of this day!=20
The light has not vanished.=20
The fire has not disappeared,=20
There is only the growth of=20
Light, bread, fire and hope=20
In Stalin's invincible time! . . .=20
In recent years the dove,=20
Peace, the wandering persecuted rose,=20
Found herself on his shoulders=20
And Stalin, the giant,=20
Carried her at the heights of his forehead. . . .=20
A wave beats against the stones of the shore.=20
But Malenkov will continue his work.

This poem remains in print in Neruda's Spanish-language collected
writings. It does not often appear in anthologies of his work in
English.

In 1971, Neruda got the Nobel Prize, which he had sought for years and
the denial of which he complains about in Il Postino, the 1994 Italian
film based on his later life. The award of his Nobel came much to the
disgust of certain members of the selection committee, who could not
forget his actions in behalf of the Soviet dictatorship. But his Swedish
translator, Artur Lundkvist, from the moment he was elected to the Nobel
Academy in 1968, made it his business to get the Chilean the prize.

When Il Postino came out, it was said that Bill Clinton and Al Gore were
among its most enthusiastic fans, and that Clinton even went so far as
to buy, as a birthday present for Hillary, a copy of Love: Ten Poems by
Pablo Neruda. But what serious reason can justify allowing the continued
transformation of this loathsome figure, vain and selfish, ambitious and
unctuous in his service to a totalitarian regime, into a champion of
Spanish literature?

And yet, here is Carolyn Curiel in the New York Times this July 6: "That
Pablo Neruda was the greatest poet of the last century is beyond
argument in much of South America." In fact, the more honest of his
fellow Chileans express great resentment that Neruda's Nobel overshadows
that awarded in 1945 to another Chilean poet, Gabriela Mistral, unknown
north of the Rio Grande today, and many of them argue that yet another
Chilean modernist, Vicente Huidobro, was a thousand times better and
more important to world literature than Neruda. Huidobro compared
Neruda, unfavorably, to a tango dancer.


THIS SUMMER the Chronicle of Higher Education gave space to Ilan
Stavans, a Mexican-born professor at Amherst, to make a new anointing of
Neruda as the savior of Hispanic literature. Along the way, Stavans had
the nerve to proclaim that Neruda's adherence to the Communist party
made him "the spokesman for the enslaved." Is this not, perhaps, a
misprint, overlooked by the proofreaders at the Chronicle of Higher
Education? The Communists were enslavers, as the whole world, except
perhaps Professor Stavans, now admits. We must ask, can one really
consider Neruda a finer poet than Paul Celan, who survived a fascist
concentration camp, or Osip Mandelstam, who died in the Gulag?=20

Such comparisons are worse than distasteful; they border on the obscene.
Federico Garc=EDa Lorca said of Neruda, "he is closer to blood than to
ink;" it was an insight of great depth, far beyond its author's
knowing--and today, unbelievably enough, the reputation of Garc=EDa =
Lorca
has been annexed to, and overshadowed by, that of Neruda. It is time to
treat Pablo Neruda as the French surrealists once recommended dealing
with another Nobel laureate, Anatole France: Let us box up his memory
with his books and throw the whole thing away. As Breton wrote, "There
is no reason that, once dead, this man should create any more dust."

Hi Everyone,
Many thanks to all who responded, frontchannel and back! I had an =
opportunity to test this same poem out at a reading in Pittsburgh last =
week, and was pleased that some folks asked to have a copy.  Instead of =
sending out paper, or waiting to see if a magazine would pick it up, =
I've taken David Kirschenbaum's fine suggestion and put it up on the web =
for all to see.  It's called RANT FOR GORGEOUS GEORGE and if you're =
interested you can read it here:
http://home.earthlink.net/~waldreid/

Thanks again,
Diane Wald

P.S.  If any of you live near Pittsburgh and have never gone to a Gist =
Street Series reading, GO GO GO!  It is the most wonderful place---the =
best sort of atmosphere for a reading.  If you Google them you'll find =
their fascinating website.

Hi Roger

I'd echo your welcome to Alan to 'these shores', I don't have any problem
with that, nor is my concern about arts funding locally based on foreigners,
what I do feel is that the arts scene here is corrupt and is geared to those
who are adept at manipulating that scene and that does truly piss me off.
With Alan what I have noticed, along with the disposable poetry, is that he
rarely engages in any kind of dialogue with others, that is to say he
presents himself, as a project, not as a fellow human being, one does derive
a kind of sense that he feels himself superior to others and therefore will
not engage in debate, he's not the only one to do that. I'm not deploying
any kind of political grudge here, I have always been of the Left myself,
but I do feel unhappy that someone who is so present also doesn't go beyond
the boundaries of self.
It is as if someone keeps shouting in my ear, without the chance of reply.

Best

I thought about this and can only say, welcome, Alan, to these shores, as
tightly bound, wound-up, fraught they are. When I first read this email
quoted below, I was with David: yes, monies on the UK poetry scene are
tight but this sort of position employing foreign nationals is very
commonplace, I think. David's questions are best addressed to tRace as to
who they fund and why.

Ah dear Alan

day after day I open my e-mail and there is yet another, and another, poem
by you. I love your poems because they are so unmemorable, you have
certainly missed a vocation in becoming some kind of advisor to groups like
MacDonalds, you are the saint of disposable verse, even the great
McGonagall
must tremble in the shades at the mention of your name. You seem to be a
really nice guy, I know one or two people who've met you and they convey
that impression, I like your politics, I'm with you on that, but why oh why
do you not realise that your project itself is the narcissistic voice of
the
ego-driven consumer - I hear nobody in your poems but Alan (not alan) and
the all that I hear tells me nothing about that Alan except for the
intensity of its ego.

I might also ask what you are doing deriving funding and support from the
tRAce project - arts funding in the English East Midlands (where tRAce is
based) is minimal and that monies are being diverted to you or Mark Amerika
when here in Leicester there isn't a proper venue for poetry readings. The
arts scene here is a total fuck-up - a few people manipulate the grants
scene, the only decent poetry mag from here is my own A Chide's Alphabet,
into which the very same people who wouldn't consider giving it support
would jump at the chance of inclusion. Brownnosers comes to mind.

Anyhow, dear Alan, I hope your sense of eminence isn't offended by my
addressing you thus, write fewer, not more, poems, get out of the ego-trip,
concentrate, aim the word-lens.

Best

Dave

Well, Jill, as for 'manners', I went out of my way to emphasise that it was
not a personal attack on Alan, everything I've heard of him says he's a
pleasant bloke, I just find myself bored by his pseudo-poetry and I do not
like his non-engagement with others in dialogue, as if he is too superior to
talk to others.

Your three-year old might find things 'not nice' but it is a cheap
rhetorical trick to employ that as a reply. 'Nice' means 'exact' 'precise'
'fine' and if you do feel anything in my post is not so you need to go
through it point by point, exactly and precisely. Using a three year old's
words as a substitute for discussion doesn't really do.

It might interest you to know that I've had a considerable number of b-c's
from people who agree with what I say but are scared of saying so openly.
Says a lot about poetic culture that.

I think that "arts funding in the UK" would be a proper topic for British
Poets. Or maybe a strongly worded letter to the Daily Mail. But not, I
think, Buffalo Poetics where, lets face, your chances of finding sympathy
for your cause are decidedly lower than in those other, more local forums.

Hi Roger

I'd echo your welcome to Alan to 'these shores', I don't have any problem
with that, nor is my concern about arts funding locally based on
foreigners,
what I do feel is that the arts scene here is corrupt and is geared to
those
who are adept at manipulating that scene and that does truly piss me off.
With Alan what I have noticed, along with the disposable poetry, is that he
rarely engages in any kind of dialogue with others, that is to say he
presents himself, as a project, not as a fellow human being, one does
derive
a kind of sense that he feels himself superior to others and therefore will
not engage in debate, he's not the only one to do that. I'm not deploying
any kind of political grudge here, I have always been of the Left myself,
but I do feel unhappy that someone who is so present also doesn't go beyond
the boundaries of self.
It is as if someone keeps shouting in my ear, without the chance of reply.

Best

Dave

I thought about this and can only say, welcome, Alan, to these shores, as
tightly bound, wound-up, fraught they are. When I first read this email
quoted below, I was with David: yes, monies on the UK poetry scene are
tight but this sort of position employing foreign nationals is very
commonplace, I think. David's questions are best addressed to tRace as to
who they fund and why.

Ah dear Alan

day after day I open my e-mail and there is yet another, and another, poem
by you. I love your poems because they are so unmemorable, you have
certainly missed a vocation in becoming some kind of advisor to groups like
MacDonalds, you are the saint of disposable verse, even the great
McGonagall
must tremble in the shades at the mention of your name. You seem to be a
really nice guy, I know one or two people who've met you and they convey
that impression, I like your politics, I'm with you on that, but why oh why
do you not realise that your project itself is the narcissistic voice of
the
ego-driven consumer - I hear nobody in your poems but Alan (not alan) and
the all that I hear tells me nothing about that Alan except for the
intensity of its ego.

I might also ask what you are doing deriving funding and support from the
tRAce project - arts funding in the English East Midlands (where tRAce is
based) is minimal and that monies are being diverted to you or Mark Amerika
when here in Leicester there isn't a proper venue for poetry readings. The
arts scene here is a total fuck-up - a few people manipulate the grants
scene, the only decent poetry mag from here is my own A Chide's Alphabet,
into which the very same people who wouldn't consider giving it support
would jump at the chance of inclusion. Brownnosers comes to mind.

Anyhow, dear Alan, I hope your sense of eminence isn't offended by my
addressing you thus, write fewer, not more, poems, get out of the ego-trip,
concentrate, aim the word-lens.

Best

Dave

i tend to feel kind of relieved when alan returns from a few days absense to this list.

the *continuity* of these postings means very much to me
--whether i read them, just scan them, or ignore them occasionally,
the output is admirable and *alan*, for me, has become a person
that tells me, for example, a lot about my relationship to non-virtual persons:
in both cases you cannot deal with everything that's presented to you
and, quite naturally, you can understand only a fraction of what you pick up
--and even this fraction is what you choose to perceive and what you choose to make of it.

arrogance? no. & i wouldn't call this no ego-trip either. the project is personal, in public. i enjoy observing how my projections on alan the person i don't know develop.

cheers, Henrike

This kind of crap makes me incredibly angry.  I have no idea why Alan
Sondheim has suddenly turned into the Rumsfeld of poetry, apparently flanked
with thugs ready to bash anyone who criticises him.  I cannot see any point
at all in your extremely personal attack on him.  I don't know Alan from a
bar of soap, I like some of his work, and dislike some of it as well.  I
don't have any problem deleting it if I can't be bothered to read it.  But I
don't think the mere fact that he posts his work on buffalo poetics, or that
he received some money from some cyberpoetics site in the UK, justifies your
extremely snide and - yes - personal attack on him.  (I quote below - I
can't see that this is anything but a personal attack)

"he rarely engages in any kind of dialogue with others, that is to say he
presents himself, as a project, not as a fellow human being, one does derive
a kind of sense that he feels himself superior to others and therefore will
not engage in debate, he's not the only one to do that."

And as for me - what status? On buffalo poetics?  Because I dare to post a
brusque note to a list serv I am a poet of huge status whose main interest
is to terrify and bully people?  I don't think so.  This is paranoid poetics
at its ugly worst.

Ah. Alan is one of my favorite writers--whether we are considering the
living or non-living; virtual or real.

I disagree with the comparison to MacDonald's, or at least the
simplistic level on which the comparison is made.

Alan's work runs contrary to the spirit (and if read, one might suggest
... ) of watered-down, goofy & insubstantial culture that MacDonald's
represents, as a class--perhaps include here Levi's and Disney ... along
with all else that undermines and crudely replaces complexity and beauty
in life.

Also, while it is unfortunate that the arts go under-funded in some
areas, this is true everywhere. Alan--I do not think--is getting rich,
or living a rich existence, from the funding he receives.

If MacDonald's were funded by donations and fed the world for free,
there might be a closer comparison --

Well first,

D: I might also ask what you are doing deriving funding and support from
the tRAce project - arts funding in the English East Midlands (where tRAce
is based) is minimal and that monies are being diverted to you or Mark
Amerika when here in Leicester there isn't a proper venue for poetry
readings. The arts scene here is a total fuck-up - a few people manipulate
the grants scene, the only decent poetry mag from here is my own A Chide's
Alphabet, into which the very same people who wouldn't consider giving it
support would jump at the chance of inclusion. Brownnosers comes to mind.

--

Well, hardly support. I'm completely unemployed and my income last year
was around $15,000 which is rather difficult to live on in New York City.
Every bit, including Trace, helps.

It's not "deriving funding" - I was invited. And British members of Trace
are of course paid in the US when they come over. It's all international
at this point.

As far as not participating - if you were at Incubation (I must suppose
you were, garnering support for your magazine - why wasn't it offered at
the book table - perhaps I missed it) - and if you were at any of the
panels I attended, you would have found I engaged just about every
speaker; I also chaired a panel and spoke at another. I've been associated
with Trace since 1997-98; presumably I have something to offer them.

---

D: but why oh why do you not realise that your project itself is the
narcissistic voice of the ego-driven consumer - I hear nobody in your
poems but Alan (not alan) and the all that I hear tells me nothing about
that Alan except for the intensity of its ego.

---

I'd say producer, not consumer. In any case, my writing - I wouldn't
necessarily call it poetry - seems to me to be about any number of things
beyond my ego. But that is for you to decide. As far as grants per se go,
I haven't had a grant in years, which of course should give you great
cheer. On another matter, I have no sense of eminence; in fact, if I did I
could probably relax.

You're lucky; I've had only one phone-call of support! But 'scared'?

According to your way of think, we should all be nationals; in fact you
might pay the moderators here a bit for their work in keeping the list
running for foreignors (whoever they might be). If you want to pursue the
nationalist line - and it _is_ that - you might write the local papers.
You might also assume that my presence at Incubation had nothing
whatsoever to offer anyone, that I was replaceable by a British national,
or at least a member of the commonwealth. You might also object to Jim
Andrews, by the way, Randy Adams, both of whom are Canadians - or is that
kosher?

I don't know who this "considerable
number" of people is, this ghostly legion, lining up behind you,
Dave, but since I've never been given to the b/c gossip/backstabbing/
innuendo/'we're behind you buddy' routine, who cares? Basically
though I don't believe you as I've seen this routine before,
attacking someone on the basis of some connection to the london
literary mafioso, an attack which is aimed
not only at the work but the person, then pulling this mutual confusion
and smiles to all routine while claiming you have a ghostly legion
of support behind you.

It is an unwarranted
attack on Alan's work and person just to make hay for your own
preoccupations, and is why you're screened on another list that
would be a more appropriate to these discussions of literary uk funding.
And all poets are not cowards, most of them I know are not,
some of us anyway are willing to say anything,

Interesting and thoughtful answers, though perhaps
they over dignify the questions, but I agree about the
nationalist argument underlying this. According to
that thinking, I should not be spending my own money
to run a webmagazine that publishes people from any
number of countries but should spend it on Amerika.
And I do like your posts, some of them more than others
of course, and do not find them particularly "ego-driven"
but when I find them most interesting, it's due to their
generating a kind of sensibility out of the most impersonal
materials, the computer language is particularly interesting.
Well, I'd guess one real voice on the phone is worth a legion of
ghosts that exist in innuendo, now back to painting the
bathroom walls,

Rebecca, please don't read my intervention as in any way directed at you
more than others--it's just a handy way to sign onto the discussion.

I'd suggest that everybody just back off this one--clearly an expense of
passion in a waste of shame. And Dave, especially: no literary list can
function if it becomes a vehicle for attacking each other's work, much less
person, no matter how strongly felt the criticism.

Hey Folks--We had a lot of fun (in my poetry class) with the love/eros
poems, and I got so many
good suggestions in that category that now I'm looking for your
recommended "family poems."  Actually, the full heading, for teaching purposes, will be something like
family/identity/trangsgression.  If the family is an important context for
wrestling with issues of identity and relation, I also want to give space
to poems dealing with the need to break out of "nuclear family"-centered
relations or
other kinds of conventional role-generating structures.  So once again,
I'm looking for a range of stuff from traditional/conventional to
experimental/perverse.  Thanks in advance...
Steve

Police harassment of panhandlers escalates on the Drive
by an East Side resident • Tuesday July 20, 2004 at 03:40 PM


On Sunday, July 18, 2004, I stumbled upon at least five Vancouver police
officers, with about as many police vehicles, arresting a man for
panhandling at the corner of East 1st and Commercial, and detaining
another person (handcuffing him while he was on his bike).



Police harassment of panhandlers escalates on the Drive

by an East Side resident
July 20, 2004

On Sunday, July 18, 2004, I stumbled upon at least five Vancouver police
officers, with about as many police vehicles, arresting a man for
panhandling at the corner of East 1st and Commercial, and detaining
another person (handcuffing him while he was on his bike). A small group
of people were standing around, watching the cops's actions with
disgust. The police gave the panhandler and the other person long
lectures and eventually let the other guy go (all he did was ask the
cops why they were arresting somebody for panning). The cops actually
told the panhandler that he should "go to another country" if he didn't
like the amazing social assistance programs that exist in this province
(as the cop put it). Some guys yelled something at the cops as they
drove by (seemingly some negative remark directed at the cops...
hopefully this happens often!). The cops lectured the panhandler for a
while longer and then "breached him out of the area", driving him in a
wagon to some other location and letting him go, probably with a ticket
fine. By the time he was about to be "breached" there were seven cops on
the scene to deal with this "major crime". A second police wagon drove
past on the other side of Commercial, and I couldn't help but feel that
I was in "occupied territory".

This event was only one case among many, as the Vancouver Police
Department, Commercial Drive Business Association and the Grandview Park
Community Policing Centre have been working together to crush
panhandling on the Drive.

Business "activists" have gone so far as to personally harass
panhandlers and spread lies about them, and they've gone to Drive
businesses and told them they'll be fined if they allow people to pan in
front of their store (which is a complete lie, but hey, that's politics
right?!?!).

For months now, Vancouver cops have been "cracking-down" on the Drive,
mostly arresting young Native kids for "dealing" or whatever.

On June 6th, a bunch of anarchists had a rowdy march up Commercial Drive
to oppose the escalated police presence and the cops attacked them and
arrested three people. The rest of the group linked arms and circled
together as onlookers shouted at the cops in support of the anarchists.
This probably made further arrests undesirable for the cops at that point.

The yuppification of the Drive was accomplished years ago, but the fact
that poor and working class people still come to the area appears to be
too much to deal with for some wankers. Just having to see a poor person
is an unpleasant "inconvenience" for a yuppie, I guess.

So, how can we fight the growth of police-state conditions of the Drive?
Something that has been used in the past is a Cop-Watch program, which
involved people following the cops around with cameras and documenting
their activity in an attempt to limit cop violence. This may work to
some extent, but is also very limited, since cops will always do what
they have to do regardless of who watches them, you won't always be able
to catch the cops in the act, and even if you do catch an abuse
"on-film" it won't have any repercussions for the cops in the end (in
court). Just look at the Frank Paul and Jeff Berg cases. The cops can
get away with murder,with the full complicity of the courts.

So maybe other tactics are in order. One such tactic could be the
"escrache", popular in Argentina, through which people publically shame
and insult politicians and military leaders by yelling, blowing
whistles, banging on pots and pans and shouting words of contempt. A
small or large group (preferably at least 8 to 10 people, or more) could
easily organize to do this to the cops on the Drive and make their jobs
hell. Of course, they'd be walking the boundaries of "obstruction", but
if enough people could organize to do this and kept their distance from
the cops, the action would be difficult to control. Our possibilities
are mostly limited by our own lack of determination and commitment. But
resistance is possible, if we choose to live a life without restraints.

history, historical events and persona. We will discuss the role of
adopting a perspective outside the self, using historical research

short discussion of how poets make use of history in contemporary
poems, we will generate some new writing which participants can read
at The Naked Readings later in the evening.

There's a lot of family stuff in _Saturday Night at the Pahala Theatre_
by Lois-Ann Yamanaka.  It's a collection of poems about a girl coming of
age, and it's both narrative and pretty experimental.  Yamanaka uses a
lot of Hawaiian pidgin, which creates an interesting music and flavor.

Well, I'm always prejudiced in these questions because I'm tempted to
recommend what I've been most recently reading. In any case, I have to
suggest anyhow Jean Connely's _Anthem_ in which motherhood seems dominant,
Li-Young Lee's poems about his father in _Rose_  (whose title poem is great)
and other mainly pleasant family oriented poems...Sylvia Plath's "Daddy" if
you're in one of those wildly angry moods.

out of it, lock, stock, and barrel: MURDER OUTSIDE YOUR BELIEF, that's the

ensuring the survival of one against all the rest of the dirt; that's all

I like my new incarnation as a nationalist, like it because I can't stop
laughing at how wrong it is. I live in Leicester, which is one of the most
ethnically diverse cities in Europe, typically I was having a drink
lastnight
with my Russian mate Eugene, my Scots pal George and a beautiful Japanese
lady I'd never met before.
My complaint was about the diversion of resources from local areas, not
about nationality, my Russian pal, my Scots mate, the Japanese lady, all
live here,
they are part of the community and give it life and have much right as I do
to it,
I could mention for instance that the only effective arts
centre here has a program controlled by a guy who commutes in from Luton -
does that make me an anti-Lutonite?
You can check out how nationalistic I am not by looking at A Chide's
Alphabet which amazingly is mainly comprised of writers who are not English.
I am so angry about that false accusation.
I am afraid Alan's poems do bore me - I know they are dead because I can't
remember any of them, it isn't that I think he can't write but he wastes his
talent.

I can beat Alan in being unemployed, btw, I am and get about 2500 pounds a
year - I survive thanks to friends - I wasn't at Incubation because a) I
wasn't invited and b) I didn't have any physical copies of the mag anyhow.
If you want to know about the poetry scene re mags in the East Mids well
there is Staple (funded) a Derbyshire magazine of flat verse, and Poetry
Nottingham International, which has as its greatest claim to fame once
printing an errata that apologised for the fact that it attributed a poem by
B.M.Nizditch to the already extremely late Philip Larkin. An also funded
mag.

Apart from that a few rags and my own utterly unfunded one. The address on
my signature is wrong btw - I can't correct for some reason - but it can be
easily found on a google.

But thanks to all the middle-class people who have tried to caricature me as
some kind of creepy right-winger - I really appreciate that.

All the Best

An ultra right-wing Christian site (which asserts that " Ann Coulter, Marvin
Olasky, Michele Malkin, Daniel Pipes...read why these and others of their
ilk should replace the impotent political machine that American citizens
were too lazy to prevent from being elected") passes on this quote from
Martin Luther, a locus classicus of "just war" theory:

 Martin Luther writes:
      When I look at war, how it punishes the wicked, slays wrongdoers and
makes such desolation in the earth, it appears to be a very unchristian
thing and altogether contrary to Christian love. But when I consider how it
defends the godly and protects wife and child, house and home, earthly
possessions and honor and keeps them in peace, it is seen to be a good and
godly thing. For if the sword did not defend and maintain peace, everything
in the world would go to rack and ruin. Therefore such a war is nothing but
a short absence of peace to prevent everlasting and unbounded strife; a
small misery preventing a great misery.


      What is said and written about war as a terrible plague is all true,
but it should be remembered at the same time how much greater is the plague
which war prevents. If people were saintly and willing to keep peace, then
war would be the greatest plague on earth. But do you not see that the world
is evil, that people do not desire to live in peace but want to rob and
steal, and kill and abuse your wife and child, and take away your honor and
possessions? All over the world man fights man. No single person could save
himself from this unending strife unless the little strife which is called
war should check it. Therefore God has honored the sword so highly that He
calls it His own ordinance, and does not will that we should say or think
that man has invented it and ordained it. For the hand which holds this
sword and kills with it is no longer a human hand, but the hand of God, so
that it is not man but God that hangs, breaks human limbs on the wheel,
hacks off heads, slays, and makes war. It is all His work and judgment.


(Dubya evidently believes this, too.)

Christopher, I am starting to feel that I wish I'd kept my mouth shut,
because the reaction +on the list+ exemplify why some people don't dare say
anything. Let's begin with Alan's poems, I'll preface my emphasising yet
again that I think he's a nice chap and that he has literary ability, I also
find the links he so often gives extremely stimulating, it is not a case of,
as Alison Croggon claimed, in her characteristic former Murdoch journo
style, of my making an 'extremely personal attack on him' or my being
'extremely snide'. I just get bored by Alan's poems - he posts a lot of them
and what is noticeable is that nobody, for or against, mentions any by name,
my comparison with Macd's still holds, Alan seems to me to be caught in a
rut of formulaic writing, it is the predictability of his verses turns me
off, it's the same old song over and over again.

As for my new incarnation as a nationalist, I'm speechless about that, I
wasn't going to go out tonight but maybe I'll share a few beers with my
Russian mate Eugene (Yevgeny) - he's from Kazan - we like to mournfully
quote Pushkin or Shakespeare or Hopkins or Mandlestam to each other while
bemoaning US crap culture. Speechless hardly covers my reaction to Rebecca
Seiferle who typically puts the boot in after an attack by Alison -
>It is an unwarranted
attack on Alan's work and person just to make hay for your own
preoccupations, and is why you're screened on another list that
would be a more appropriate to these discussions of literary uk funding.
And all poets are not cowards, most of them I know are not,
some of us anyway are willing to say anything,<

Bravo, Rebecca. I never raised the issue of uk lists, someone else did, nor
did I say all poets are cowards, that was Allison's tabloid distortion of my
words, phrases like 'colonial mentality' come to mind in respect of your
words about me being screened on a uk list, I like the fact that someone
else can refer to :

 >that's it you limies are just
jealous that a brooklyn boy got it.<

Me No Limey. Racist abuse it seems is ok if its directed to a lower-class
English person.

Three points.

Sometimes (not always) bordeom is at the threshold of something else: a sign
that you've not yet crossed it. And Cage has said sensible things about the
_usefulness_ of boredom.

That 'he posts a lot of them' seems to me intrinsic to the form(s) Alan is
making: think (by way of analogy, no more than that) of soap opera, cartoon
strips and suchlike.

Thirdly, there is a specific reference to a specific text (*The Beginning of
the Book*) in my signature line; so maybe I am an exception to your rule.
But what I also mean by 'intrinsic to the form(s)' is that to cherry pick
the 'best' may be to miss the point.

<snip>
my comparison with Macd's still holds, Alan seems to me to be caught in a
rut of formulaic writing [DB]
<snip>

My picking you up on your own formulaic 'why oh why', my attempt to compare
what you felt to be the 'incarnation' imposed on you with Alan's 'actants'
and my setting *productivity* against the sort of *resentment* a 'consumer'
might feel were part of an effort to address your claim(s) directly: one
thing I would never say is that Alan is 'caught' (steady state) in some sort
of rut; another thing I might be tempted to add is that his _being caught_
(process) can be extremely subversive.

Aphorism #64 Morality and Style (p.101)

        A writer (philosopher?) will find that the more precisely,
conscientiously, appropriately he expresses himself, the more obscure the
literary (is literature, philosophy- philosophy of literature is there a
difference?- discuss.) result is thought, whereas a loose and
irresponsible formulation (is formulation like formulae? Logic to be
reproduced - he talks below about the "logic of his day") is at once
rewarded with certain (I thought he was against "certain" understanding)
understanding.  It avails nothing ascetically to- avoid all technical
expressions, all allusions to spheres of culture that no longer exist
(effacement-forget the past as it doesn't matter).  Rigor (how is this
different than a logic proof?) and purity in assembling words(a literary
thing we call style, this assembly of words), however simple the result,
create a vacuum (obscure? but if we write in a private language and I mean
precise not in the Wittgesteinian sense).  Shoddiness that drifts with the
flow of familiar speech (this is metaphoric language - mixed as it may be
- snow drifts - catch my drift? rivers flow like snot in a snowstorm, or
time) is taken as a sign of relevance and contact: people (who are these
people? readers?) know what they want because they know what other
people(again, who or whom, are these people? Is there some sort of
audience here? Should writers be conscious of an audience? For Adorno, for
any writer, for whom are we writing for?) want.  Regard for the object,
rather than for communication( is this a matter of style again?), is
suspect in any expression (this colon bothers me, normally I'd want a list
but here I'm thinking that he means "that is") anything specific, not
taken from pre-existent patterns (allusory, allusions?- how about when a
musician uses a sample - not in A's day but there was still copyright and
he was in Hollywood), appears (are these preconceived notions?)
inconsiderate, a symptom of eccentricity (Adorno's eccentricity?), almost
of confusion(so what, misleading? Is there a path to truth? I would think
that Adorno would want us to take the path less traveled - engage in the
tangle).  The logic (Descartes- the equation) of the day ( is a cliché, a
shortcut, a preconceived notion,  does this need elucidation? I think so -
So, what is the logic of the day? a logical fallacy in itself? "Most
people believe that"…- I need some facts here), which makes so much of its
clarity (I didn't think clarity was the goal here), has naively adopted
this perverted notion of everyday speech (whose everyday speech is he
talking about? He has already in this text set himself to be the
intellectual exile- he writes in German- what else???). Vague (open?)
expression permits the hearer (what happened to the reader? Are we in a
different aesthetic realm now?) to imagine (I thought the dialectic idea
was born out of imagination?) whatever suits him and what he already
thinks in any case (these pre-conceived notions, do they only reaffirm
what we already know? Can there be no new knowledge?).  Rigorous
formulation( the kind of show your work conditions, How did I arrive at
this?) demands  unequivocal (can there be such a thing? There must be
gaps
in interpretation -I think anyway?) comprehension, conceptual effort, to
which people are deliberately disencouraged, and imposes on them in
advance of any content a suspension of all received opinions (is effort
being replaced by preconceived notions? Think of popular culture- the
sitcom- where I know before the first commercial that even though Monica
stole her parents' pick-up to go the Guns and Roses show, while her
parents forbade her it all works out because Daddy dropped some acid the
night before his LSAT, he failed but he learned his lesson as he had to
study while his friends went to some party in a farmer's field that you
can rent as Woodstock) and thus an isolation (is this preferred by Adorno?
I thought the dialectic involved a community of ideas - bouncing and
shooting like Disney stars from a 45 cent sparkler?), that they violently
resist.  Only what they do not need first to understand, they (again, who
is this they? Listeners or readers) consider understandable; only the word
coined by commerce, and really (really like truly or as a superlative - I
mean I really like your work does not mean that I really understand what's
going on here) alienated, touches them as familiar [is the familiar bad?
Trendy? It reminds me of… for instance, Grant Boland's work reminded me of
Atilla Richard Lucaks and not Carravagio so have I misread the work?
(Canadian hyper-realism-  they are about 15 years apart- I should have
asked him when I was at his party)].   Few things contribute so much to
the demoralization of intellectuals (I remember in Victoria Park in
London, Ontario sitting on a bench (think of Bannerman Park) and some
spiky haired teens came by. My mum said (as she will talk to anyone; the
apple doesn't fall far from the tree) to one of them that it reminded her
of her nieces in the seventies - purple hair and studs and all. I think
that the kid was more offended that this sixty year old woman didn't find
her offensive but rather quaint - that's not much of a story for the
squat- talk about demoralization).  Those who would escape it must
recognize the advocates of communicability as traitors to what they
communicate.

Having been on the list a long time, I've seen several cycles of attack
and defense of Alan's work.  I'm almost starting to think of these cycles
as somehow *part of* the work.  And the recurrence is like some sort of
emergent phenomenon keyed to the dynamics of this particular complex
system.  But Alan could probably pursue an idea like that better than I
could...

Steve,

One of my favorite family poems--and one that students seem to love, or at least be provoked by--is "Kaddish" by Ginsberg.  Zukofsky's "A-12" is a family fugue (not to be confused with Family Feud :), and  I also think Reznikoff's "Early History of a Writer" in By the Well of Living and Seeing is a great family poem.  There's also a few by George Oppen about his wife and daughter throughout his corpus.  Of Being Numerous #29 and "Sara in her Father's Arms" from The Materials come to mind.

Good luck with your class.  Let us know how it goes.

Best,

Grant

Steve,

Mei-mei Berssenbrugge's "The Four Year Old Girl" is also a great choice.
There's a great essay on "mothering" and making poetry titled "To book as
in to foal. To son" in Kathleen Fraser's book Translating the Unspeakable:
Poetry and the Innovative Necessity. I think of much of "A" as a family
poem, and Michelle Leggott's book on Zukofsky's "80 Flowers" shows how that
is, in important ways, a family poem. The first half of my book Near or
Random Acts (Singing Horse Press, 2004) is in some ways a family poem.
Creeley's elegy to his mother (someone else please provide the reference --
I don't have his books with me right now) is another possibility; he has
poems in his latest book that are also family poems -- also in the chapbook
Yesterdays, published by Chax Press.

Poor you - did you apply for a bursary? You might have gone to Incubation
for free -

As far as my writing goes, it's not for you, that's clear enough.

Glad you listed your friends from all over. That really makes a
difference. Perhaps we should all do that. How international we are.

Did anybody else see this story?

Yesterday, the Los Angeles Times carried a follow-up to Bush's remarks on Cuba
last Friday.  Bush had charged that Fidel Castro was brazenly promoting sex
tourism to Cuba.  "The dictator welcomes sex tourism.  Here's how he bragged
about the industry," Bush said.  "This is his quote: 'Cuba has the cleanest and
most educated prostitutes in the world.'"

hmmmmm . . .

So what is Bush's source for this?  Turns out that the quote was cribbed from an
undergraduate paper that had been posted to the web after it won a prize in
2001.  But, as many of us know all too well about all too many undergraduate
papers, the quote was not footnoted in the original and the student writer is
unable to produce a source for it.  That's bad enough already, but it tuirns
out that in the context of the paper itself, the unsourced quote has nothing to
do with comments on any sex "tourism" or "industry" anywhere.  The student
makes it clear in his paper that the quote is a bit of bragging about Cuba's
advances in literacy,,,, and at best the "quote" is a paraphrase of a remark
Castro made back in 1992 that had nothing to do with the cleanliness of
anybody.

The student's defense would probably not hold up in a Freshamn English course.
He now says: "I don't know whay I don't have a footnote for that. . . . That
was before I was in law school and understood that you have to footnote
everything."

One wonders what Bush's defense would be?

at any rate, I think it safe to say that there is a clear pattern and practice
of dishonest use of sourcing in the Bush administration --

I was friends with God once, and He's omnipresent.

So that makes me international--not to mention--intergalactic.

I had some friends who were friends with other gods and Gods and G-ds
and they were from all over, too.

Wow.

i'm not interested in cheap rhetorical tricks, david. i just say it how it
is.

i have two children, both of whom create much tiredness in me by the end of
the day. if i can come up with any time, any words to write to the list, i
think i'm doing pretty well. most nights i don't even have time to read the digest
list i receive, just delete, or don't even have a chance to do that, delete
en masse later. i happened to read the list that night, and i happen to care
about an open forum on the poetics list. so i mustered my words and that's what
you got. i heard her voice in my head when i read your post, and that's what i
reported, what she would say if she knew of your actions, could understand
them in the context of posting, listservs, etc. what i too would--and did--say.
i'm not hiding in the words of a three-year-old, just pointing out that even a
child has the sense to know what's kind-hearted and what is unpleasantly
delivered.


you know,
you don't have to like alan.
you don't have to read his posts.

but for the poetics list to function as an inclusive list, we all have to
respect each other, at least minimally.

i wonder why you didn't directly address the issue of wanting alan to be more
present as a person if that's your main issue. you could have written him a
private, or public, email that says so. or something. but to slash and slander
[defame, malign--m-w.com] him, or his work, for all to see. it's rude, it
kills the openness of the forum, and it's just plain unpleasant to have to be
around that kind of behavior.

your post is the sort of post that makes people "scared of saying so openly"
about a whole host of issues.

lots of people have had lots of different opinions about alan and his poems,
his posts over the years. your back-channel support is not interesting, nor is
it surprising. but some of us enjoy the regularity of alan's work, some even
enjoy the content, and some just delete...

alan, i don't have your number, so i can't call you. but i support your
presence here. (haven't we all been through this before?...)

and now, off to change a diaper--

Particularly weird in that while there is certainly "sex tourism" in Cuba
(especially on the part of Mexicans and Italians) the prostitutes are
severely punished--what organization there is in the industry is among
travel agents in the source countries.

There are also a lot of casual liaisons between Cubans and foreigners for
the length of the latter's stay, the motivation for which is the receipt of
luxury items, like restaurant meals or nights on the town (Cubans don't
starve, but life is for most pretty close to the bone). The regime
discourages this as well, but sporadically. That's the way the regime works
in most matters--it's the insecurity of not knowing when the crackdown will
come that keeps people in line.

The Cuban men and women who engage in these liaisons would resent being
called prostitutes. Cuban culture is unusually tolerant of casual sex,
anyway. This extends to homosexuality, tho not, unfortunately,
officially--lots of opportunistic prosecutions.

What is entirely amazing, is that before I sent the original message, I
had something in there about Klingons, but took it out at the last moment.

Bizarre.

But yes, there are entire, impoverished slave planets near M-31, whose
rulers fund my work, yet deprive their minions of the most basic needs,
including burlesque shows.

And in the case of Cuba, I think many Americans know this. It's one thing to build a hate campaign that relies on America's total ignorance of Islam. It's another thing to wage such a campaign against Cuba. I think many Americans will recognize his statements as the gibberish of the incredibly ignorant. This is one of those gaffes that the big liberal media conspiracy could really pick up on, though I'm betting they won't...

This is about the Miami Cuban vote and nothing else. Bush's operatives
probably have told him that he's lost a lot of votes there by curtailing
people's ability to visit or help their families on the island. So he's
pulling out the stops. He doesn't think he needs your vote or mine.

I'm not talking about your vote or mine, I'm talking about moderates with a basic familarity of Cuba.  The Bushes will take Florida in November -- they took it before with the point of a gun, and we can't/won't stop them from doing the same now.  But in the Midwest and Southwest, "conservative" still means "protecting daddy's values," and daddy didn't like lying politicians and knew damn well that Castro isn't a proponent of the sex trade.

Talonbooks is pleased to announce that it will be launching its Fall
Poetry Line-up in Canada with a major Toronto happening at the Drake
Hotel 1150 Queen St W in Toronto on August, 17th 2004 7:00pm-whenever
(hopefully a very late whenever).  The event will include readings
from bill bisset, Adeena Karasick and Jamie Reid. Marc Glassman from
Pages Books will be interviewing them prior to their readings. Blaine
Speigel of Blankfoto fame (recently performing at the Om Festival)
will provide lighting environments and projections. There will also be
music, a showing of the video 'Private God' featuring bill bissett as
well as other video material from, about or on our poets. This a great
chance to enjoy a Mid-summers' night poetic blow-out at a great
location for literary entertainment in Toronto with three poets who
are all amazing readers and performers.

A little about our poets recent work:
=20
narrativ enigma / rumours uv hurricane by bill bissett (0-88922-507-9;
6 x 9; 144 pp; $17.95 CN / $13.95 US) is the newest book from one of
Canada's best known and celebrated poets and artists. bill bissett is
the author of over 20 books (8 with Talonbooks) and is well known for
his ability to capture and mesmerize his audience with playful,
energetic, and powerful readings. His most recent book, peter among
the towring boxes / text bites (0-88922-464-1), won a BC Book Prize
for best poetry in 2003, an award which he had won ten years earlier
for inkorrect thoughts in 1993. bissett is also the inaugural
recipient of the Milton Acorn People's Poet Award.
=20
The House That Hijack Built by Adeena Karasick (0-88922-511-7; 6 x 9;
128 pp; $19.95 CN / $15.95 US)
This is another of Adeena's electrifying and visually stunning works
of collage and poetry that has made her one of Talonbooks's most
critically acclaimed poets. It includes a fascinating 30 page long
poetic reconstruction of the Kabbalistic text the Sefer Yetzirah. Her
writing has generated great international interest and has been hailed
as "an impressive deconstruction of language and meaning" that is
"exuberant in [its] cross-fertilization of punning and knowing,
theatre and theory." Karasick won a BC Book Prize for M=EAmewars in 1996
and the Bumbershoot Book Prize for Dyssemia Sleaze in 2000. You can
check out more about her at www.adeenakarasick.com

I, Another. The Space Between: Selected Poems by Jamie Reid
(0-88922-512-5; 6 x 9; 156 pp; $17.95 CN / $13.95 US) This is the long
awaited new volume of poetry from Jamie Reid, a key figure in the
Canadian avant-garde poetry movement in the 1960s. The publication of
his first book, The Man Whose Path Was on Fire, in 1967 took the
Canadian poetry circle by storm. Reid then took a 20-year hiatus from
writing poetry, despite this enormous critical success. He finally
returned to the literary scene as the editor of the well respected
journal DaDaBaBy and has since authored many other works. This is his
first book of collected poems.

Spanish Anarchist Dies in Prison Isolation Unit


     Prison authorities say that Josè Antonio Cano was found after
hanging himself with a bed sheet in an isolation unit at the "Modelo de
Barcelona" prison in Barcelona, Spain, on June 17th of 2004. His
anarchist comrades say it was murder.

Spanish Anarchist Dies in Prison Isolation Unit

Prison authorities say that Josè Antonio Cano was found after hanging
himself with a bed sheet in an isolation unit at the "Modelo de
Barcelona" prison in Barcelona, Spain, on June 17th of 2004. His
anarchist comrades say it was murder.


This was the result of more than 12 years in jail for "common crimes"
and of reprisals of every kind on the part of the guards. Especially in
the last four years, Josè suffered torture that escalated in the last
year: isolation and psychological manipulation. Josè fought until the
last moment with all means - included a hunger strike from February 14th
to April 6th of 2004. He passed through three hospitals and then back to
the Modelo jail, and in none of these places did he receive adequate
treatment.

Josè, like many Spanish anarchist prisoners, was subjected to the "FIES"
(Ficheros de Internos de Especial Seguimiento - Inmates Files for
Special Monitoring), extreme isolation units which subject prisoners to
total control all day. Their mail and phone calls are monitored, they
have few opportunities to stay with other prisoners, their belongings
are constantly inspected, and torture is customary. The prisoners who
are included in these "Files" are the rebellious ones, those who don't
submit to the prison authority. In fact, the FIES were instituted after
a series of revolts inside Spanish prisons. In February of 2004, Spanish
anarchist Gabriel Pompo Da Silva managed to escape from a FIES unit and
prison, and released a statement to his family and comrades.

In the wake of Josè's death, his anarchist comrades called for ongoing
struggle: "against the prison society, the society of the spectacle,
State-Capital, and every authority! For anarchy!"

On June 19th, 2004, there was a demonstration held for Josè at the
Modelo jail, involving 30 to 40 people and two banners reading "the
jails are centers of extermination" and "while there is a single person
imprisoned, there will not be freedom." The demonstration lasted about
three hours, during which leaflets about Josè's torture were handed out
to relatives of prisoners who were coming out of the jail after visits.
Prison guards and undercover police heavily surveilled the demonstrators.

I imagine his defense is to blame his "vetters." ("Forgive us our vets as we
forgive our vetters," he said zealously.)This was my favorite part of the
story:

<snip>
On Monday, administration officials acknowledged that they did not have a
source for the wording of the president's citation other than Trumbull's
paper. A White House spokeswoman defended the inclusion, arguing it
expressed an essential truth about Cuba.

"The president's point in citing Castro's quote was to highlight Castro's
morally corrupt attitude to human trafficking," White House spokeswoman
Claire Buchan said. She pointed to two other instances in which Castro
boasted of the education level of Cuba's prostitutes; in neither case was
the context a direct promotion of sex tourism.

The speech "was vetted the same way all the president's speeches are
vetted," Buchan said, declining to provide details.

Subject: Intelligence Abuse?


Did anybody else see this story?

Yesterday, the Los Angeles Times carried a follow-up to Bush's remarks on
Cuba
last Friday.  Bush had charged that Fidel Castro was brazenly promoting sex
tourism to Cuba.  "The dictator welcomes sex tourism.  Here's how he bragged
about the industry," Bush said.  "This is his quote: 'Cuba has the cleanest
and
most educated prostitutes in the world.'"

hmmmmm . . .

So what is Bush's source for this?  Turns out that the quote was cribbed
from an
undergraduate paper that had been posted to the web after it won a prize in
2001.  But, as many of us know all too well about all too many undergraduate
papers, the quote was not footnoted in the original and the student writer
is
unable to produce a source for it.  That's bad enough already, but it tuirns
out that in the context of the paper itself, the unsourced quote has nothing
to
do with comments on any sex "tourism" or "industry" anywhere.  The student
makes it clear in his paper that the quote is a bit of bragging about Cuba's
advances in literacy,,,, and at best the "quote" is a paraphrase of a remark
Castro made back in 1992 that had nothing to do with the cleanliness of
anybody.

The student's defense would probably not hold up in a Freshamn English
course.
He now says: "I don't know whay I don't have a footnote for that. . . . That
was before I was in law school and understood that you have to footnote
everything."

One wonders what Bush's defense would be?

at any rate, I think it safe to say that there is a clear pattern and
practice
of dishonest use of sourcing in the Bush administration --

You might want to look at Russell Edson's work, plenty of very
dark takes on family.  Also, Cornelius Eady's book "You Don't
Miss Your Water" Lyn Hejinian's "My Life" and Theresa Hak Kyung
Cha's "Dictee" especially the Melpomene and Erato sections.

New on theatre notes:

http://theatrenotes.blogspot.com/

Macbeth

Macbeth by William Shakespeare, directed by Fiona Blair, with Richard Bligh,
Stewart Morritt, Julia Zemiro, Mark Hennessy, Grant Mouldey, Georgina Naidu
and Jeannie Van De Veld. The Old Van, at Theatreworks, until August 1

In Macbeth , it is always night: an endless darkness which brings no sleep,
a waking dream from which there is no escape.  As the critic Jan Kott says,
this is history as nightmare: not a grand cyclical mechanism by which power
replicates itself, but rather the infection of a murderous insanity.

Minefields and Miniskirts

Minefields and Miniskirts , adapted by Terence O'Connell from Siobhan
McHugh's book, directed by Terence O'Connell, with Robyn Arthur, Tracy
Bartram, Debra Byrne, Tracy Mann and Wendy Stapleton.  Playbox Theatre,
until July 31.

I'm sure I'm not the only person who started reading about the Vietnam War
again earlier this year, when the word "quagmire" was redefined as a no-go
zone and the comparisons with Iraq started getting insistent.  The US
military were again talking of "winning hearts and minds" while Marines
razed foreign villages and got blown up on foreign highways.  General
Kimmitt was holding his Five O'Clock Follies, and the indie journo was back,
as hip as ever, telling the real stories: the art galleries in downtown
Baghdad, the graveyards in Falluja, the deadly taxi rides to Baghdad
Airport.

Blog review

Theatre Notes has been going for six weeks!  My, how time flies when one is
having fun!  And I think it's probably a good time to pause and consider
what, if anything, the blog has achieved since early June, when I had a rush
of blood to my head and began this quixotic enterprise.

Peace,

This response will not be an obituary to the soul of a black man unsold
to ameriKKKa. God willing, this will be a awake up call to our peoples
to never allow our warriors to be DISrespected, used up and tossed aside
for not surrendering to the greed machine of massive western plantation
hype â€“ not to allow them to be DISSed for speaking the truth -- 4
preserving our Culture by testifying, to his peoples, in this the mad
house of amerikkkan atrocities.

I thought that was a nice UNobjective piece about a black man who
prophesied all this horror, war and rape 30yrs prior -- "B-Movie" -- in
his most successful and understandably hard to get jewel "Reflections".
It was a jewell that told it like it is and Gil, like most of our
warriors, paid the price for speaking on the truth and to his people.
Gil wanted and wants to speak of the madness of ameriKKKa and how it has
corrupted the world and set an agenda to Disassemble afrika and the
afrikan consciousness. Gil did all this before it was trendy to do so,
before Chuck D found Farrakhan to put to a beat, before and after white
ameriKKKa tossed scrilla at starvin "niggaz" and got them to buy into a
false identity of ghetto, semiliteracy and self DIS CONstruction in the
massa level pimp industry of hip hop â€¦and â€œniggazâ€ still donâ€™t want to
admit theyâ€™ve been played.

...and when we listen to the flow of Heron, we hear not dated tales on
the politricks of the west B.U.T. the cautionary prophesy of what will
come (and what has come) if we don't "control our resources". Those
resources being natural to the spiritual strength of our peoples  -- Gil
Scott- Heron is a black man who stands up and doesn't kiss up to the
money machine industry of white controlled hip hop = a black man who
spoke/speaks his mind in a "Message to the Messenger" and acted like an
elder and not a played exrevolutionary trying to cop a ride on the next
thang. When Mr Heron flexed his darts about the â€œGunâ€, and the â€œBottleâ€
he wasnâ€™t shootin his own people or offering them a liquar add to dull
their consciousness.  It is evident that in the treacherous times of
'CONvert or die" to the tom machine and it's "present minded
individualism" that we have a Black man who is not willing to surrender
â€“ even under the slow torture of the western media murderersâ€”cuz Mr
Heron is a rhyme warrior; he is a â€œmedia assassinâ€ being assassinated by
the media for not shuffling for the folk. So as we have seen and read
about with our Garveys, our Griots, our Shahadats/martyrs/warriers, our
Obsidian Panthers, our Kings, Maliks, our Hueys and Bobbys, our
Lumumbas, our Shakur fam. â€“

My people,

someone's out to bury that brave black man. ...and we still, like we
have done to so many of our bruhs, watch them get buried alive. ...then
we holla about gettin brave strong black men and wonder why our youth
would rather sellout than be that man. When you got a dissident you make
a public spectical of their slow and cruel torture and death. This is
done to DIScourage the young, who look on from the sidelines, from
taking the same route that this ONE did. Cuz our youth watch speechless
as we stand by, en masse, letting the few and feeble levels (as  Frances
Cress Welsing coined the term) do whatever horrors to another uppity
shine. Why would any black boy want to be that man? For, he sees us,
like the paleface, use up black men, dis them and toss them aside when
â€œwe done feedingâ€.

So, meanwhile, are offered heroes and put up with junkie half wits and
sellouts from the 60's, 70's, 80' s and 90's who have never said
anything of any intelligence and are glorified for their rehab visits,
overdoses, addictions and drunkenness, how much scrilla they have/be
given/been â€œallowedâ€ to have and in the tom section of amerikkka, how
many times you got shot and how many niggaz you done took out for white
amerikkka = Hip hop/rap = neoplantation? and rhymin house niggaz what's
gotz rhythm?.

I think Gil/Mr Heron put it well when he said; "...Iâ€™ve been living in
America all my life. Iâ€™m used to doing time in places I donâ€™t want to
be! F*** white people and the way they treat you sometimes!â€

Hon Min Farrakhan spoke on the same point and I paraphrase -- 'i speak
you to from a prison not of my making.'
http://www.finalcall.com/pressconference/

With the public attack on our warriors like this I guess Gil Scott Heron
was right when he said; "the revolution will not be televised".

The metaphor of the COINTEL PRO is in full effect?

Don't believe the hype about the bruh -- he's only human, a brave one
B.U.T, human and this hell can get anyone down B.U.T. the bruh still
hasn't taken pride in singing or chanting about how 'he done capped a
nigga', bust a b*7$h out' nor has he sold out to the industry = â€œda manâ€?.

...if he had, I'm certain, my breddren and sistren, that the article
would have spoken from a different "lighter tone" and how what a good
bwai that Gil be, son.

F$Â£@ amerikkkanada, the eu, ukkk and isunrael...

peace to our Shahadat/Martyrs of the inner and outer battles against in
justice

Big up to Gil Scott Heron â€“ he spoke his mind and he still got that mind.

Like James Baldwin, Mr Heronâ€™s life is a testimony

â€œThey will tell you it's hopeless out there on the avenue, But if they
really knew the truth, why would they tell you??? And if they look at
you like you insane, And they...start calling you "Scarecrow" and say
you ain't got no brain Or start...tellin' folks that you've suddenly
gone lame, Or that...white folks have finally co-opted your game, Or
worst yet, implyin' that you really don't know, That's the same thang
they said 'bout us...a long time ago. Remember: KEEP THE NERVE, KEEP THE
NERVE, KEEP THE NERVE, KEEP THE NERVE...â€

â€¦keep your nerveâ€¦

Stay strong

freedome, justice, equality

the refuge

there's no lack of candor in so much of the
world's destruction. for example, the oceans are
deluged by carbon dioxide, ice caps are melting,
and neither global warming nor evolution are
theories. where does that leave us? every day we
witness the extinction of species, starvations,
cruel tortures of humans and other animals. every
day, humans bow down in fetid worship. every day
commands increase the population; it remains true
that over half of all humans who have ever lived,
are alive today, and well on the way to violent
deaths. we are faced with rulers who do not care,
who will reap the amputees before the final
cataclysm. the earth sours, we are all the worse
for it, and it is of course our making. now we
begin the enormous journey of cosmic pollution;
we shall, however, collapse of our own accord,
before too much damage can occur elsewhere. on
earth, we testify to fury, hyperssxed bodies
waiting for the next predictable onslaught of
orgasm. the earth is absorbed in our reproductive
decay, we are all colonists, some of us in bitter
pain and despair. slaughter comes from within and
without; genocide is universal, specicide, as
whole worlds disappear. the great whales, lemurs,
amphibia, raptors, all are disappearance; no
longer can grandeur or cuteness save them. the
medicinal value theory is a hoax, designed to
prolong the death agonies of ourselves and those
we slaughter. nothing saves nothing; of all, we
are the greatest in our absence, and the most
destructive. one can only call, as we have, over
and over again, for suicide as the least harmful
of outcomes, but it must be mass suicide. with a
blink of an eye, our rulers are gone; with a
blink of an eye, government is disabled, and the
rest of us crawl and immolate any thing in our
paths, another form of jockeying for useless
power. i would gladly give this up, i will return
to the manipulation of my avatars and puppets,
which remain mute, as if swallowed in their
silence. there is something to the screen that
begs ontology. it is the refuge of the damned.

to bow are the are carbon _ occur are no neither
candor and are much our leave world's puppets, of
example, to humans are the ever carbon _ own caps
there's neither candor is evolution much any
leave world's and extinction example, something

Hi Alan

Your poem reminded me of this one, which I wrote recently -

All the best

Alison

Beasts

The beasts are retreating.  They are sliding
into the dusk, into the supple light of vanishing trees,
into the glue of dreams.  All their strangeness
wavers behind wire, between the four sides of a screen,
odourless and deathless.  The beasts stare out of
bleached pages, enclosed at last, and the zoos
are silent, except when parrots and keepers
conduct their weird orchestrations.
Panic flicks in those slotted eyes but the sadness
is only ours.  Police hunt corpses in rubbish dumps,
a pregnant mother and child.  Beneath the surface,
submarine cries burst the ears of whales.
Coral is leached to stone by the stripped sunlight
and houses crouch by the shore, awaiting the wave
prophets see in the distance. In forests
that glow at night, there are boars and wolves
whose futures mutate daily.  There is much that is unknown
as always and even more that now will never
be understood.  The cedar forests of Lebanon
are tinder dry and bears starve on the wet tundra.
In the depths of night there may be a phone call
we dare not answer or a cry in the street
which makes the hair rise on the back of our necks.
They will not come back, something is happening
at the backs of our eyes, behind the reflections,
and billboards shout in the silence, delivering words
that in a more innocent age we thought were ours,
as pixelating dolphins surf the endless waves.

Wow, this has a similar structure, and resonates; we lived in Miami for
nine months, and there was _this_ feeling, almost exactly.

Tonight we attended a Sierra Club meeting in which two 'whistle-blowers'
from the EPA spoke; it was heartening and hopeless at the same time -

  the refuge

  there's no lack of candor in so much of the
  world's destruction. for example, the oceans are
  deluged by carbon dioxide, ice caps are melting,
  and neither global warming nor evolution are
  theories. where does that leave us? every day we
  witness the extinction of species, starvations,
  cruel tortures of humans and other animals. every
  day, humans bow down in fetid worship. every day
  commands increase the population; it remains true
  that over half of all humans who have ever lived,
  are alive today, and well on the way to violent
  deaths. we are faced with rulers who do not care,
  who will reap the amputees before the final
  cataclysm. the earth sours, we are all the worse
  for it, and it is of course our making. now we
  begin the enormous journey of cosmic pollution;
  we shall, however, collapse of our own accord,
  before too much damage can occur elsewhere. on
  earth, we testify to fury, hyperssxed bodies
  waiting for the next predictable onslaught of
  orgasm. the earth is absorbed in our reproductive
  decay, we are all colonists, some of us in bitter
  pain and despair. slaughter comes from within and
  without; genocide is universal, specicide, as
  whole worlds disappear. the great whales, lemurs,
  amphibia, raptors, all are disappearance; no
  longer can grandeur or cuteness save them. the
  medicinal value theory is a hoax, designed to
  prolong the death agonies of ourselves and those
  we slaughter. nothing saves nothing; of all, we
  are the greatest in our absence, and the most
  destructive. one can only call, as we have, over
  and over again, for suicide as the least harmful
  of outcomes, but it must be mass suicide. with a
  blink of an eye, our rulers are gone; with a
  blink of an eye, government is disabled, and the
  rest of us crawl and immolate any thing in our
  paths, another form of jockeying for useless
  power. i would gladly give this up, i will return
  to the manipulation of my avatars and puppets,
  which remain mute, as if swallowed in their
  silence. there is something to the screen that
  begs ontology. it is the refuge of the damned.

  to bow are the are carbon _ occur are no neither
  candor and are much our leave world's puppets, of
  example, to humans are the ever carbon _ own caps
  there's neither candor is evolution much any
  leave world's and extinction example, something
  day, are is who carbon

Ok then Alan, let's take this poem as a case in point. Obviously it's
something to do with me as it quotes recent posts of mine, we also have the
director of the Federal Reserve and a touch of physics plus avatars thrown
in. I can honestly say, and this is not a matter of not being 'nice', that I
have no idea of what it means. This isn't a matter of indulging in personal
attacks, I'm not flaming you, but the poem conveys nothing to me - I derive
the impression of being presented with an argument without content. I
imagine it is supposed to be some kind of satirical take on my remarks and
that is why they are quoted but I am guessing here. If you do find something
risible in what I said then you need to make a case, it's not enough to just
quote my words back

BusinessWeek isn't typically the sort of publication one would expect to
see a piece such as this, especially by one of its editors. It's worth
noting tho that the current regime is so radically right wing that
moderate corporatists have perfect reason to feel alarmed.

Bruce, I remember seeing Gil Scott-Heron in Madison in the early 80s in a
show of his own brand of one-man multi-performance.  Rita and I were volunteer

A Ravaged Musical Prodigy At a Crossroads With Drugs

By AMY WALDMAN (NYT) words
Late Edition - Final , Section A , Page 1 , Column 1

DISPLAYING FIRST 50 OF WORDS - The judge in State Supreme Court in Manhattan
stared sternly through her glasses at the defendant, whose body trembled.
''You have been around this planet for a long time, and you've been using drugs
for a fairly substantial amount of time as well,'' she said. ''What I want is

...................................................................

You can buy the article at the NYTimes website; I remember reading it in the
paper when it appeared.  The interview passages were fairly extensive, as I
recall.  Gil Scott-Heron (or the reporter) said in the article that he had
written a 500-page description of himself as not-a-drug-addict.  There was the
topic of confining him in a treatment hospital, part as punishment and part as
medical treatment for a condition he said he didn't have.  I remember thinking
that a literary defense/interpretation of his position might necessarily be
long, written.

Hi Jill, I can see where you are coming from, and comprehend your viewpoint.
Let's try to give you a picture of my existence - last night I found myself
talking to a midget who was trying to a pastiche of Swinburne's 'The Garden
of Proserpine' because he'd been challenged to do so as a forfeit by a lady
he met at an s&m do in Birmingham on Sunday night. The penalty was being put
in a cage.
Tonight I went out for a last orders drink at the local pub and was waylaid
on my way back by our local hermit who came out for once and wanted to tell
me how much he hated e.e.cummings. Things like these happen to me all the
time, I get somewhat paranoid as a result, one starts to feel that the
universe is a joke on oneself.

All the Best

Dave

i'm not interested in cheap rhetorical tricks, david. i just say it how it
is.

i have two children, both of whom create much tiredness in me by the end of
the day. if i can come up with any time, any words to write to the list, i
think i'm doing pretty well. most nights i don't even have time to read the
digest
list i receive, just delete, or don't even have a chance to do that, delete
en masse later. i happened to read the list that night, and i happen to care
about an open forum on the poetics list. so i mustered my words and that's
what
you got. i heard her voice in my head when i read your post, and that's what
i
reported, what she would say if she knew of your actions, could understand
them in the context of posting, listservs, etc. what i too would--and
did--say.
i'm not hiding in the words of a three-year-old, just pointing out that even
a
child has the sense to know what's kind-hearted and what is unpleasantly
delivered.


you know,
you don't have to like alan.
you don't have to read his posts.

but for the poetics list to function as an inclusive list, we all have to
respect each other, at least minimally.

i wonder why you didn't directly address the issue of wanting alan to be
more
present as a person if that's your main issue. you could have written him a
private, or public, email that says so. or something. but to slash and
slander
[defame, malign--m-w.com] him, or his work, for all to see. it's rude, it
kills the openness of the forum, and it's just plain unpleasant to have to
be
around that kind of behavior.

your post is the sort of post that makes people "scared of saying so openly"
about a whole host of issues.

lots of people have had lots of different opinions about alan and his poems,
his posts over the years. your back-channel support is not interesting, nor
is
it surprising. but some of us enjoy the regularity of alan's work, some even
enjoy the content, and some just delete...

alan, i don't have your number, so i can't call you. but i support your
presence here. (haven't we all been through this before?...)

and now, off to change a diaper--

Mohawk's of Kanehsatake calling for renewed support


     The struggle for self-determination in Kanehsatake is far from over
and the Mohawk community is asking for your support. In solidarity with
the 284-year struggle against colonialism by the Mohawk Peoples of
Kanehsatake, a newly formed coalition has come together to, in part,
facilitate the transportation of outside supporters into the Pines area
of Kanehsatake where community members have been maintaining nightly
guard against police incursion into their territory.

The struggle for self-determination in Kanehsatake is far from over and

In solidarity with the 284-year struggle against colonialism by the
Mohawk Peoples of Kanehsatake, a newly formed coalition has come
together to, in part, facilitate the transportation of outside
supporters into the Pines area of Kanehsatake where community members
have been maintaining nightly guard against police incursion into their
territory.

For the past 6 months, since January 12th, 2004, the peoples of
Kanehsatake have successfully resisted a federally sponsored,
politically motivated, militarized invasion of their community. They
have put their lives and freedom on the line in order to stop the
formation of a police state headed by Grand Chief James Gabriel, whose
leadership itself was imposed through a federal court injunction.
Twenty-four Kanehsatake community members face charges of participation
in a riot and forcible confinement of police officers.

Resistance on the part of community members has meant, in part, camping
out, night after night over the past three months, in the Pines of
Kanehsatake. Community and outsider presence in this pivotal geographic
area is necessary if bloodshed in the community is to be prevented and
federal and provincial sponsored aggression is to be stopped. The task
of maintaining guard is exhausting, and community members continue to
request and appreciate the physical presence of people from outside of
the area in the Pines alongside them.

Support is especially necessary now, given that the community of
Kanehsatake faces great uncertainty as the Band Council mandate has
ended and elections for the new council are still two months away. James
Gabriel has proclaimed that he and his council allies will continue to
rule, with Quebec Native Affairs backing. Gabriel "needs" law-and-order
- his criminal police force - to be implemented in the community before
he start election campaigning he says. Due to these circumstances, and
the uncertainty of the situation, the community of Kanehsatake is asking
for supporters to come and stand with them through this transition
period. Bring your tents, some food, and any recording devices such as
video cameras, cameras, mini-discs, etc.

Solidarity with Kanehsatake means standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the
community and sharing in the burden of their struggle. If you can't make
it to Kanehsatake, call all Canadian & Quebec officials involved in this
ploy. Demand they respect the Mohawk peoples' right to determine an end
to this crisis, and their political, economic and policing future.

helping organize transportation for supporters, e-mail

BACKGROUNDER

Grand Chief James Gabriel of the Kanesatake Band Council is a politician
dazzled by powers given by Quebec & Canada no matter the cost to his
community. People in Kanehsatake are fed up with Canada & Quebec's
attempts to use Gabriel to undermine Mohawk sovereignty, culture, land
rights and economies. Learning about Gabriel's deals with government
only through press releases, the community's been excluded from
decision-making - a cornerstone of the consensus-based Mohawk culture.
With Gabriel's help, Canada has nearly accomplished its goal of
subordinating Kanehsatake's sovereign national status to that of a
municipality through Bill S-24, the "Kanesatake Land Based Governance
Act". Canada's January 12th attempt at imposing totalitarian rule over
Kanehsatake - by funding Gabriel's privately-controlled, 60-person
police force - left community members no place in the affairs of their
own community. Or so Gabriel hoped. Since January 12th, Kanehsatake
residents have demonstrated their opinions through militant resistance,
and successfully stopped attempts at outside invasion and political
interference.

In 1994, leaked documents proved Canada was planning a 6,000-troop
military invasion of Mohawk communities producing and selling their own
cigarettes. One report stated the need to "target the Indian's claim to
the inherent right of inter-tribal trade with sister Mohawk communities
and the native run tobacco manufacturing industry as a whole". With all
other funds tightly controlled by Department of Indian Affairs & Band
Council, the Mohawk tobacco trade is the one autonomous source of income
enabling Mohawk families and social services to sustain themselves. It
enables Mohawks to organize and fight Canada's attempts to assimilate
and control them. The growing economic strength of Mohawk Nations
threatens the implementation of Canada's colonial agenda, it's not just
about lost tax revenues. Canada's January 12th "extraordinary" police
operation, and April 1st Tripartite Policing Agreement (which transfers
control of policing in Kanehsatake to Canada, Quebec & Gabriel) both aim
to crack down on this Mohawk economy not, as they claim, "organized
crime". Chief Gabriel stated he wants his police to "cut the head off
his opposition". Gabriel's opposition is Quebec & Canada's too. This is
why our governments are so invested in Gabriel's leadership they've been
making deals excluding half the Chiefs on Council and the whole of the
community. This is why Quebec & Canada maintain Gabriel is "the sole
legitimate authority for Kanehsatake". In the context of 21st century
colonialism, Canada rewards native "leaders" willing to place their
communities under Canadian and provincial jurisdiction. Last year's
First Nations Governance Act was defeated by the unified efforts of
Indigenous communities across Canada. Now the strategy is to implement
the legislation quietly, community-by-community, in order to avoid
collective resistance. Once again Kanehsatake is drawing national
attention to Canada's colonial agenda by standing up to all the
government can throw at them. They are determined to not allow Gabriel's
collusion with the state to undermine their rights, nor set a precedent
for the assimilation of other Indigenous Nations.

DIA: blacks and our depression #3
A note from Fernwood/The Hood/New Palestine

==============================
by
Lawrence Ytzhak Braithwaite
An author in North America

There has been essays written concerning Blacks and depression (one of
which is by Dalani Aamon entitled "Blacks and Depression") and one of
the causes of this depression having come the residual effects of the
African Americans Experience starting with slavery. Not all of us have
been slaves or from a slave background nor were we raised in the US
psychic landscape but we have been assaulted by it. A great deal of us
are Diasporic and so the effects of the affected African American
psychology has invaded our domes. The US racism and the Canadian
supremacy has had a damaging impression on our lives and mental health.
I'm am certain that there are those who suffer from chemical imbalance
which render them privy to mood swings on various scales. However, the
state of dread and downpressor inwhich most of us have to exist offers
us little moments of true being and I'm afraid prolonged exposure to the
madness and twisted logic of North America only brings more pain and
collapse.
We must realize that mental illness in Black people, on our continent,
is not tolerated. Not by the medical profession nor our own peoples.
When it comes to Blacks, especially Black men with mental illness, we
have not progressed from the Restoration period and William Hogarth's
depiction of Bedlam. Our Bedlam can be either the mess of North America,
the ghetto, or the state found in the etched imprints in our mentals
(minds).

We have become driven by this madness as did Tom Rakewell (an 18th
century playa) who, disassociated with his home, becomes enveloped in
the underlying message of greed and status orientated London, England
(or as is refered to as being a "demented Britannia"). However,
Rakewell, has little knowledge and absolutely no overstanding of the
true makeup and motivation of the libertine rakish society inwhich he
falls into and is seduced by. He only sees what is considered successful
and acceptable and then follows through hoping that --no -- thinking
that this will make him and remake him in the eyes of the new society.
Rakewell's efforts lead him to riches, poverty and then madness.
We, as Black people, whether ghetto or yuppy or middle-class, are caught
up in this disassociation of place and contexte. We cannot, although we
may front on the matter, make sense of the cognitive dissonance that is
this demented America. It as if we are children or men caught in an
abusive household each one of us or as a collective have fallen into the
familial role of those in an abusive home'
The perfect one,
The peace keeper,
The clown,
The rebel
But no matter how much we struggle in our roles we still fail to achieve
the overstanding and remove ourselves from the situation. The house must
fall. We must cease to help it exist with all it's secrets and past
abuse. Our presence fuels it. It legitimizes it. The abusers knows, far
more than we ever will, under these circumstances, how to push every
button and manipulate us with status, money, power and maybe even a kind
word and genteel touch here and there.
Right now, and for a longtime, a world has been fighting back to end
this abuse or to stop the abuser from incorporating them in the vicious
circle of this madhouse. We, as Black peoples, don't seem to overstand
this -- fully. Which is why we assist in the assaults or close our doors
(selves) to our own. We point fingers and take pleasure watching each
other fall. We invent new philosophies and transforms ancient faiths to
fit them into the demented American landscape. First on the list of
blaim is each other and then comes this metaphysical white man (a devil
or snake or yacob). But very little is done to actualize our anger and
redemption except when it comes to attacking each other (the lost, the
mental slaves, the 85, the uncivilized, the gutter negro, the country
nigger, the 10, the sellout...) we have many names for the
understandably confused and depressed Black peoples and we are swift to
attack each other and kill each other, especially in the most cruel of
fashions, and that is in the willful destruction of a human beings
aspiration -- our spirit our Black souls. It would be easier for us to
achieve peace and overstanding of the system of downpressor than it
would for us to overstand each other and accept out weaknesses and
strengths and victories. So we hunt for leaders to lead us (because of
slavery and this endless Moses metaphor). We choose dead heroes (silent
and well printed posters on college walls or in house holds. Maybe a PBS
documentary they offer us during a now infamous Black history month).
Last we follow puritan inspired ranting fascist who distort philosophies
and faiths for the purpose of power and control. But what we lack is a
revolution of all our own. Where Blacks can finally be peoples with all
the faults and greatness that most people know over this planet and are
willing to starve and die for.

If you look at it this way who wouldn't be depressed. And if a Black man
has a mental illness then it will certainly become magnified to the
point inwhich it becomes madness -- as William Carlos Williams wrote of
the Black peoples of North America "true products of America go crazy".
This pandering to abuse and the constant blaiming of each other is a
suicide. It is a slow and cruel suicide as most true suicides are.
Forget what you've heard and what you think or read or have been taught.
A true suicide is not a call for help and the failed attempts are not
failures. They are practice sessions to insure that when the time comes
and the right mixture is found that it will have the perfect
effect/affect -- it has become the a hard Science combing proper
elements. It has, unfortunately become true M.A.D.ness = Mathematics of
the African Diaspora. That would be the North American obsession with
the crossing, the passing, the otherside, what most humans call simply
death. For it is in death, we are taught, once by this physical and now
metaphysical slavemaster and now by each other that we truely achieve
rest, perfection, peace and blessings and sometimes greatness.

Of course we have the right to sing the Blues. But I'm afraid that it
has been optioned and copyrighted for pub houses and biker soundtracks.
But so has every diasporic invention of art.
So that would make anyone sad or as Rod Serling once wrote a line in
"Requiem for a Heavyweight", "don't it just make you want to lay down
and die." ...or can it Bee, as Lauryn Hill once wrote, "Die for me/you
said you'd die for me/live for me/why don't you live for me".
The future is ours if we remain what Marcus Garvey once called "The
Nation" and we truely believe -- in each other = the original peoples,
with all our faults; cease to submit to the effects of
hypocrites/munafiquns in this "demented America".

Gil Scott-Heron was my creative writing teacher when I was an undergraduate.

I had always tried to avoid creative writing classes, but they were required of
all English majors at Federal City College in the 70s -- so, I got the list of
available teachers and nearly jumped out of my seat when I saw Gil
Scott-Heron's name there -- You have to remember this was at the time when, in
addition to the radio success of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised," Gil
had three LPs out, a book of poems, and two novels -- and this guy was only
about a year older than I was at the time --

I signed up for the course after hearing his beautiful WINTER in AMERICA, the
album he did in between his early ABC sides (produced by Bob Thiele) and the
later Arista records after he'd signed with Clive Davis --

He was a great encouragement to me early on, and drugs had not yet gotten so
much of a grip on him that they were interfering with his abilities to function
-- that came in the 80s --

He was also hooked up with Brenda Sykes, a gorgeous young actress who has pretty
much disappeared from film in the intervening years, and they had a daughter,
to whom some of his later works are dedicated --

Look for the film of his concert at DC's Wax Museum for a sense of Gil at his
best -- it's out on VHS & DVD -- fortuantely, nearly all of his recordings
(except for the very late stuff) have been reissued in recent years -- the
voice & the approcah to singing remain fairly unchanged throughout -- but it's
a voice I'd dearly like to hear back on the scene again -- the novels are also
available again -- you might take a look at the first one if you're curious to
see what sort of detective novel gets written by a precocious 19 year old --

Dear David Bircumshaw:

It's odd that you surmise that Alan Sondheim in his
"Moving On, by Alan Greenspan" is attempting, and
failing, to make an argument, specifically failing to
satirize you and your remarks.  He's pretty clearly
using your initial remarks about him, and subsequent
posts in the thread you thus inaugurated, as grist to
create another one of his endless run of puzzling,
thought-provoking,  consternating thingies, his
"sondheims" as someone on this list once put it.

When Alan wants to MAKE SOMETHING PERFECTLY CLEAR he
tends to do just that--like in his short post about
how his poems were clearly not for you, David, which
then went on to fool around with your contention about
being even poorer than he.

But in the "sondheim" called "Moving On, by Alan
Greenspan" we are presented with you and alan and pro
alan & anti alan as forces of a curious scrimmage and
storm...and we can set the words against each other
interestingly: e.g. Alan as allegedly "caught", Alan
as probably best able to "pursue" a certain
thought...but why Greenspan, yes why Greenspan...  Is
it just Alan Sondheim randomly throwing another Alan
into the mix to force us to construct meanings, or are
there more intentions in his mind than that, I
wouldn't know...he throws Greenspan in right after
evoking the competition about who's more unemployed,
so maybe A.G. is summoned as a ruling class common
enemy of both sondheim and bircumshaw...and Greenspan
is said to provide very cryptic answers at press
conferences, so one could think of an interesting
contrast of different types of crypticity, Greenspan's
obsfucation as political strategy, and Sondheim's
elusiveness to create his "machines made of words".
And other meanings I could construct, but enough
already.

_______________________
So.  I wanted to say also that contra what you have
said there is evidence on this list that Alan does
engage in discussions if you start a good one.

We saw James Baldwin at Union Theater in Madison in those days, too.  He came
on to the stage wearing a purple beret, dressed to the nines.  And his face
lit up, and he read, slyly.

violation fabric


understand the rush of creation
exhilaration of new times
Laurie Anderson used to speak of having fun
it was fun to listen to her

there are darker periods in human history

a name for these, violation fabric

but be not afraid, the videos are peaceful
something to think about, why are they such

exaltation

why is all writing not a sign or simulacrum of violence
as theory might have it, but a sign of weak action and peaceful thought?

here i am occupied with the keyboard, doing nothing else
drinking a little coffee maybe, television on in the background
azure watering and repotting plants
"Audubon's Wildlife" to my left, "A Comic History of England" to my right
not to mention Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne, Operating System Concepts

anyway
i'm not killing anyone, i'm just writing
i'm caressing the real, no matter what i say
look, a mountain just turned upside-down
the land's turned to sea, sea's turned to land

anything and nothing can happen here, it's like that
neural debris skimming neural debris, here's the result

Thanks for all the words on Gil Scott-Heron....

Lately been thinking alot about how great the 1980 album is,
even with the "overproduction"

Shah Mot, and "Sometime Early This Morning Or Was That Sometime Late Last

Hi Stephen

this is getting very complicated - I'll try to put my thoughts in order -
forgive me if they don't come out right. Firstly, you say:

>It's odd that you surmise that Alan Sondheim in his
"Moving On, by Alan Greenspan" is attempting, and
failing, to make an argument, specifically failing to
satirize you and your remarks.  He's pretty clearly
using your initial remarks about him, and subsequent
posts in the thread you thus inaugurated, as grist to
create another one of his endless run of puzzling,
thought-provoking,  consternating thingies, his
"sondheims" as someone on this list once put it.<

Well Alan's poem uses remarks by me right up to near its end so it's
definitely not a case of using initial remarks. Where I am more concerned is
in your evaluation of the poem as a 'sondheim' which goes back to my initial
point about ego-tripping, you seem to be saying that Alan's poems are worthy
of note because they are by Alan, this is circular logic.

It's quite probably right that the Director of the Federal Reserve is the
common enemy of both Mr Sondheim and Mr Bircumshaw but Alan has used tactics
of misrepresentation and scorn in this debate - you ate falling into it when
you say:

>David, which
then went on to fool around with your contention about
being even poorer than he.<

It wasn't a contention, Stephen, I am wholly unemployed and live on an
income of 55 pounds a week. If it wasn't for the generosity of some friends
I would starve (a loaf of bread here nowadays can cost over a quid). Alan
complains that he has difficulty living on his income in New York - I
couldn't even afford to live in London let alone NY. His remarks re trAce
are quite revealing -

>Poor you - did you apply for a bursary? You might have gone to Incubation
for free -<

Incubation, which is hosted by Nottingham Trent University, costs a fortune
to attend and is a monument to the international bourgeouisie, Alan is one
of its paid speakers. Most of the monies for arts funding re poetry in this
region go into trAce, mainly to pay the salaries of its administrators,
there's a fairly clear economics in the poetry scene hereabouts - De
Montfort University in Leicester is the leading producer of arts admin
graduates in the country and the soak goes to trAce, Charnwood Arts and the
English dept at Loughborough. Meanwhile, next to nothing goes into
supporting local writers, and that isn't a point about nationality. A very
few people manipulate funding and I get them trying to be published in A
Chide's Alphabet, because it has kudos, but not for instant would they give
the mag support. I suspect Alan doesn't realise what he's bought into.

All the Best

Dear David Bircumshaw:

It's odd that you surmise that Alan Sondheim in his
"Moving On, by Alan Greenspan" is attempting, and
failing, to make an argument, specifically failing to
satirize you and your remarks.  He's pretty clearly
using your initial remarks about him, and subsequent
posts in the thread you thus inaugurated, as grist to
create another one of his endless run of puzzling,
thought-provoking,  consternating thingies, his
"sondheims" as someone on this list once put it.

When Alan wants to MAKE SOMETHING PERFECTLY CLEAR he
tends to do just that--like in his short post about
how his poems were clearly not for you, David, which
then went on to fool around with your contention about
being even poorer than he.

But in the "sondheim" called "Moving On, by Alan
Greenspan" we are presented with you and alan and pro
alan & anti alan as forces of a curious scrimmage and
storm...and we can set the words against each other
interestingly: e.g. Alan as allegedly "caught", Alan
as probably best able to "pursue" a certain
thought...but why Greenspan, yes why Greenspan...  Is
it just Alan Sondheim randomly throwing another Alan
into the mix to force us to construct meanings, or are
there more intentions in his mind than that, I
wouldn't know...he throws Greenspan in right after
evoking the competition about who's more unemployed,
so maybe A.G. is summoned as a ruling class common
enemy of both sondheim and bircumshaw...and Greenspan
is said to provide very cryptic answers at press
conferences, so one could think of an interesting
contrast of different types of crypticity, Greenspan's
obsfucation as political strategy, and Sondheim's
elusiveness to create his "machines made of words".
And other meanings I could construct, but enough
already.

_______________________
So.  I wanted to say also that contra what you have
said there is evidence on this list that Alan does
engage in discussions if you start a good one.

Dear All,

I've just received word that Ron Sukenick passed away yesterday
morning after a long illness.

I first met Ron five years ago when I arrived on the CU-Boulder
campus.  Kass (Fleisher) and I got to know Ron and his wife, the
scholar and Toulouse-Lautrec biographer Julia Frey, quite well in the
short time before they relocated to Manhattan.

I knew Ron, then, in his later years, and he was always kind,
generous and supportive of my work.  I regard his ~Mosaic Man~ as one
of the finest US novels of the past half-century.

I'll miss him, and I regard his passing as a great loss to the
international writing community.

Best,

Joe

After six years "lurking" on the list, I have to say, not only are we now
subjected to two or three Sondheim poems every day, others are responding
in kind with their poems. I wonder if you could just share them back channel
with each other. Seems not to be really very well mannered to make us all
page quickly through them (they really are not very interesting).
Posts and threads such as the Family poetry thread are on the other hand
fascinating and what the list should be about.

Couldn't disagree more. While I am receiving every day three or four versions of
Alan's txts - because we are on several common lists - and have to delete the
unnecessary copies - such a constraint..., I find his work really interesting
and not at all ego-driven. He explores new textualities in new contexts - to
put it roughly, but remaining the central node of the networks he wanders
within - remaining the "Author" if you wish, he thus expresses poetically a
sort of connected subjectivity, which is all that could be labelled
"ego-driven"... Well, that is not the point anyway. I think that we have seen
through the different posts during the last days that Alan has a lot of readers
on this list, and also that some people dislike his works. You should have a
closer look to the name of this list, though: it isn't [Poetry], no, it is
[Poetics]. Which means that this list should be open to experimental
approaches, inquiries and searches in contemporary writing and its meanings in
our networked society. Alan's works are completely at their right place when
posted to this list. People here should be more open-minded and accept that
this digital agora welcome different voices and different thoughts. I
personally have no interest in the topic "family poems", but have you read an
incendiary post from me about it? Debates and queries can keep going on on
parallel ways - after all, that is the meaning of such a public place.

Sincerely,

Cyrill.

I agree; I knew Ron a bit through Alt-X, and found him both kind and
supportive; this is very sad news.

Good smegging God. What criteria does a poem have to satisfy in order to
be considered "interesting"? The idea that *talking about* poems is
inherently more interesting than actual *poems* just makes me want to
weep.

This idiotic Sondheim contretemps recurs with shocking regularity on this
list. A bunch of people (like me) post that they like his stuff. Another
bunch doesn't. Can one bunch just learn how to use the filters that come
built into almost every email client, including, IIRC, pine and elm? I
would sign up for a Sondheim-only list, but I don't think there should
bloody well have to be one. Harry Nudel bats one out of the park every now
and then too. It's not just those who profess a certain set of politics
that show me something I like.

If poetics in action are not poetics, what are poetics?

Well, since there seems to be such Sondheim debate, maybe Alan should start
up an email list of his stuff so people can get it directly.

However, "what the list is about" seems to be somethign that could be
debated forever & ever and I wonder if one person can really say -- or is
there a mission statement out there that states there shan't be any
poetry???

I don't think we should boot Alan out or any other poet out. If you read any
of the posts over the past week or two, (and if you don't read, why do you
post?) there are quite a few people who love Sondheim's work and even more
who have no objection whatsoever to it.  Just because some people dislike it
does not mean it has no place here.

Just put all your poetics posts in a separate folder... There are so many
per day that Alan or any other poet can hardly be blamed for the amount of
emails there are.

I try to keep things simple because they get complicated enough anyway.



I've always supported the right of Alan Sondheim or any other poet to post
their work to the List. If I'm too busy to read them or not interested, I
use my delete button. Sometimes it's an inconvenience.



But look at all the good work that's being written that has no other place
to go. At least we have the option of reading it and the authors have the
opportunity to have their work read.

There is.  And you should have received it when joining the list.  It
begins like this:

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its third incarnation, the list carries
about 1000 subscribers worldwide, though all of these subscribers do not
necessarily receive messages at any given time. A good number of other
people read the Poetics List via our web archives (see web-address above).

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry that
are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form
and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to
the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable,
and impossible.  We recognize that other lists may sponsor other
possibilities for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and focused nature
of this project, and respect our decision to operate a moderated list. For
subscription information or to contact the moderators, write to
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

(I'm certain the rest can be obtained from the moderators.)

I'd would rather see *more* postings in line with this mandate, rather than
less.

When I was 18 I heard Jacquet with Mingus at the Five Spot during a period
in which Mingus changed his front line almost every night. I arrived early,
in time to hear Mingus teach Jacquet the introduction to Peggie's Blue
Skylight. It was a very interesting rehearsal. Jacquet was a good one and
it's a shame to lose him.

Dear all: this seems like an appropriate time to send out the latest
version of the poetics listserv welcome message
in its entirety.  You'll note that there is no explicit policy or
statement about posting poems on the listserv--I personally feel that
it's perfectly acceptable to post poems but at the same time I'd be
very disappointed if in-depth discussion were replaced entirely by
poems (and this doesn't seem very likely to happen).

All best,
Lori Emerson

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its third incarnation, the list
carries about 1000 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time. A
good number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
(see web-address above).

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of
form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.  We recognize that other lists
may sponsor other possibilities for exchange in this still-new medium.
We request that those participating in this forum keep in mind the
specialized and focused nature of this project, and respect our
decision to operate a moderated list. For subscription information or
to contact the moderators, write to <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

This is a private list and information about this list should not be
posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to keep the
list membership to those with specific rather than general interests,
and also to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume
manageable. The current limits of the list are 50 messages per day,
and two messages per subscriber per day.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the high number of
subscribers, we no longer maintain the open format with which the list
began (at under 100 subscribers). The specific form of moderation that
we employ is a relatively fluid one: in most cases, messages are
reviewed after having been posted to the list, and difficulties
resolved on that basis; however, the list moderators may shift with
impunity between this and a pre-review mode which calls for all
messages to be read and approved before being forwarded to the list.
We prefer to avoid this option, as it hampers the spontaneity of
discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to these options, the
list moderators may place subscribers who find themselves unable to
abide by the rules of the list under individual review, in which case
only their messages would be received for moderators' approval before
being forwarded to the list. We remain committed to this editorial
function as a defining element of the Poetics List (for further
information please see section 6 of this Welcome Message).

Those few individuals who are no longer welcome to post on this list
have forfeited that right because of their refusal to abide by list
policies as stated in this Welcome message. While we adhere to a
practice of not discussing particular cases on the list, the areas of
our greatest concern include flaming of other list subscribers,
including the list owners, and/or giving us false registration
information. Please note some individuals have publicized false
accounts of the policies of the Poetics List. We have deemed it unwise
to respond directly to the flames of the list, preferring simply to
note here that the Poetics List exists to support and encourage
divergent points of view on Modern and contemporary poetry and
poetics. We are committed to do what is necessary to preserve
this space for such dialog. For this reason, the list has always been
private or moderated.

Further information on posting to the list for subscribers, publishers
and series-coordinators, see sections 5 and 6.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts
to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage
posts that announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5
for details.

----------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe you provide
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
All posts to the list should provide your full real name, as
registered. If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it
appears in the "from" line of the message header, please sign your
post at the bottom.  PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information
and correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators at the
lists' administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message
should include all of the required information. All other questions
about subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription or
subscription policy, should be addressed to this same administrative
address.

PLEASE NOTE: IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS TO PROCESS SUBSCRIPTION
REQUESTS.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having messages from the
list returned to us. If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to
request an increased quota from your system administrator.  You might
also consider obtaining a commercial account. In general, if a good
number of Poetics messages are bounced from your account, your
subscription to Poetics will be temporarily suspended. If this
happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by contacting
the moderators at<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-----------------

3. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.  If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics digest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics nohtml index  --or--  set poetics
html index

*to temporarily turn off Poetics mail send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics nomail

*to reactivate Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you
are going to be away for any extended period of time.  Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages but
other important mail.

-----------------------

4.  To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options) go to the
right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html  You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then return to your new address and contact the

--------------------------

5.  Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in
this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
Feel free to query the list moderators if you are uncertain as to
whether a message is appropriate. All correspondence with the
moderators regarding submissions to the list remains confidential and
should be directed to us at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or
in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of
this list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications are always
welcome.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly to the list
address: <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list to our
administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>

For further information on posting to the list, see section 6 below.

-------------------

6. Cautions

For the past couple of years we have made it clear in the welcome
message that flaming is not tolerated on the list and, to ensure that
all subscribers are clear about what flaming is and why we don't do
it, it was defined as any post which attacks "fellow listees or the
list owners, also messages designed to 'waste bandwidth' or cause the
list to reach its daily limit".  Flaming is now defined as any post
that resembles a personal attack or personal insult to anyone--
subscriber or not--in any way at all. This of course includes ad
hominem arguments in which the person rather than their work is
attacked--in other words while critique of a person's work is welcome
(critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the list), this
critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the person.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudononymous
subscriptions.  We also discourage the sending of HTML-formatted
messages to the list. All messages intended for the Poetics List
should be sent in Text-Only format.

Please also do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post.  Messages containing attachments
will be presumed to be worm- or virus-carrying and will not be
forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 50 or fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

I teach at a school
and we have these bloody meetings
where we talk about and talk about
and talk all bleedin' evening
about some ol' thing
that doesn't really matter
but give someone a minute
and they'll take a bleedin' hour
and they'll talk about and talk about
just what are we doing there
they'll define the word 'meeting'
they'll count the number of chairs
but really all I'm thinking 'bout
is when I'll go on home
or how my new dress socks look
or why my mother lives alone
or can a marriage really last
or how could we bomb those people
or will the extinctions end
or what happened to our freedom
or what that means to me
who has given her life to writing
yes, I'm sitting in this room
while others are off fighting
yes, how can one address it
the injustice of it all
without reinscribing it
that 'it' and its shopping-malls
and these meetings they'll go on
and on, a bureaucratic blitz
but we all have better things to do
like read poetry on the Poetics list.

Open Adoption for Art


I am looking for 'good enough mother'  for colloborate  in art project.
Paintings need narrative and development. Core image my not be altered!
But, objects maybe attached to edges.   I am putting together baby books.

While the birthplace of the art open for adoption is New York, safe,
stable, and loving homes are looked for all over the world. Anybody will be
given serious consideration regardless of race, creed or sexual preference.
A once chosen "good enough  mother" may take care of the adopted art for
one year or less.

Art in this program is always evolving. Nevertheless, the art adopted must
get a name first. In addition, it is of the utmost importance that the
parent is documenting the well-being, social-interactions, or physical
development of the adoptee, and routinely sends in updates with narratives,
photographs, sketches, etc.
If you feel that you cannot provide your adoptee with a safe environment,
we suggest a virtual open adoption program. The adoption conditions are the
same.

 For more information on this project please contact me and see  Open
Adoption for Art and Cases in Need on my site  art-poetry.info

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

DNC COMING DOWN HARD


Excuse me, ma'am, I'll have to check your purse.
Pardon me, sir, you'll have to leave that glazed donut here.
Gee, wouldn't it be cool if I saw the Clintons.
Gee, wouldn't it be cool if I met the star of Gigli for a beer.
Excuse me, ma'am, I'm going have to sniff
   your pretty little shoes for bombs.
Pardon me, sir, you're going to need to put this hood over your head
   while I bitch slap you.
I bet at lunch I'll go out and see Bill Clinton ordering chicken fingers
and crab rangoon.
I bet Michael Moore is sweating like a bastard out there; it's almost
Farenheit 90.

I oughta go down to the Fleet Center and protest like a cop!
I'll stand in the little sheep pen of chain link fence and razor wire
   and shout at the delegates who are thinking of cocktails.
Only cops could get away with protesting in Boston like they did.
They put their lives on the line clubbing tree huggers
   and spraying mace
   into the eyes of the granola-packing protesters.
They're penned in next to the diesel fumes of buses. I wonder if
   Barbara Streisand is here. I will carry a sign that says:
VOTE FOR KERRY I GUESS.
And she'll smile at me while a junior lieutenant sticks
   and oak nightstick into my ribs.
Susan Sarandon is so hot. I'll wave my sign at her
   that says I'LL VOTE FOR KERRY!
IF HE RIDS THE NATION OF RIGHT-WINGERS
   AND WARM WINTERS.
But I'm a realist, I watch the knees scrape and bleed in the melee.
I know Kerry, if elected, will have to make peace
   with all the wack-jobs awaiting the second coming.

Wouldn't it be cool to meet Ziggy Marley on the train?
What would I say? I'm so not cool. "Hey, Ziggy."
   "What's up."

The sausages are fantastic, eh? I mean just great!
Bet the RNC gets the message, gotta find new
      vendors, can't have mine, they've been tested
      and 60% approve the Democratic platform.

These are my vendors, and I gotta go get a big
      sausage, 'cuz that's how we do it in
      Boston.

Win!   Win!    Win!

Oh lord, these are just wonderful fuckin' sausages....Oh
       Mr Presumptive Nominee, may I get you one? Peppers?

I'm going to get out there and party like an anarchist.
I'll wear my best torn jeans and black tee-shirt.
Oh, Black Tea Society, I get it. I guess.
I hope I run into Katie Couric. "You know," I'll say,
   "you're a real hero to bubbleheads nationwide."
I bet the delegates are just getting started
   when Boston bars close at 1 am.
We'll all go back to John Kerry's place
   and watch his favorite video where he kills
   some Vietcong guy running into the jungle.
It will be late and I'll collapse on a couch.
Ted Kennedy will yawn, his pants button undone.
Al Gore will play the banjo.
Peter Jennings will ask me what I think of things.
Michael Dukakis will snore in a recliner. Hillary
   will still be on the phone.
It will be time to head home. I will give
James Taylor a ride.

Flea on your donkey!
Waffling flip flop man
Uber brahmin!
Botox boy!

The whole fucking town will be destroyed
   by the time the poets arrive
   next week.

I'd just like to point out, for those of you using
Microsoft Outlook or some other such program to
receive e-mail -- and even Yahoo has this feature
now -- it's very easy to create folders and
filters that re-direct e-mail "from" a certain
person (or group) to a certain folder. So if
Alan's or any other person's posts are so
offensive to you, all you have to do is create a
rule in your settings and have them filtered
directly into your trash can. A little bit of
work, yes, but even easier in the long run than
dragging and dropping or hitting the delete key.

If it's the very IDEA of Alan or Nudel or whoever
clogging the list with poems or rants or
what-have-you, that strikes me as more of a
protocol issue which inches dangerously close to
censorship at worst and exclusion at best.

best,

DH

After six years "lurking" on the list, I have to
say, not only are we now subjected to two or three
Sondheim poems every day, others are responding in
kind with their poems. I wonder if you could just
share them back channel with each other. Seems not
to be really very well mannered to make us all
page quickly through them (they really are not
very interesting).
Posts and threads such as the Family poetry thread
are on the other hand fascinating and what the

Alan Sondheim must be doing something right, because there's more discussion
on at least his strategy than on anyone else on this list. The measure of
his success is that, like all progressive artists of the past, he
exasperates and irritates some people. Whether his work will be known a
decade from now is in question, as it is for everyone's work. But by being
overproductive, Alan forces the issue of neglect.

    ...the puzzle pieces begin to come together... We are not "looking
    out" for REAL "terrorists." We are looking out for those who may
    only "sympathize" with criminals. Basically, we are being asked to

    into the cookie-cutter mold of Western Christianity. i'm like a lot

    arrest, provided he hasn't hurt anyone.

Don't Believe the Hype: We're Living In a Police State
by Abu Jamal

In the Name of the One and Only God, the Most Compassionate, the Most
Merciful...

It was a hot Summer night in August, 1992 when Don Carlson heard someone
trying to beat down his front door. The sound boomed through the front
room, amplified by the fact that it was empty. Carlson had recently lost
all his furniture to his ex-wife and now the pounding was echoing off
the stripped floor and walls of his suburban San Diego house. Fearing
for his life, he grabbed his handgun and fired two shots at the door.
Neither shot even went through. Then the pounding got louder and the
door started tearing off its hinges. Terrified, Carlson spun around,
dropped the gun, and ran out of the room. A bullet tore into his thigh
and sent him sprawling across the hallway floor. Staggering into his
bedroom, he scooped up his cordless phone and started dialing "911" as
he fell into a corner. Two more bullets ripped into his back. One of
them splintered and collapsed his lung.

"Don't move or I'll shoot you again," yelled a voice. Carlson was
blacking out and figured he was dead.

Then a man identified himself as a federal drug agent. He and several
other men grabbed Carlson, handcuffed him, and left him on the floor
bleeding as they began tearing what as left of his house apart. "Why
would they do this to me?" he muttered, barely able to breathe. Carlson
was a law-abiding citizen, a computer company executive who had never
been in trouble with the law before.

However, none of that seemed to matter. It hadn't stopped the dozen or
so U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs Service and San Diego
police officers who broke in and shot him. They had been told he had
2,500 pounds of cocaine in the house. The tip came from an informant
named Ronnie Edmond, an ex-drug dealer who was being paid $2,000 by the
federal government to snitch on others in the drug trade. However,
Edmond had lied about Carlson. He was no drug dealer. Edmond had picked
the house because he thought it was empty and figured he could come up
with another lie when the agents didn't find the cocaine.

Don Carlson believes some of the agents who stormed his house back in
1992 wanted to kill him to cover up their mistake, but couldn't because
so many different jurisdictions were there. "The only thing that saved
me was that there were too many agents involved," he told the
Post-Gazette for its series.

As it was, Carlson spent the next eight weeks in a hospital hooked up to
a respirator, then many more months in painful physical therapy trying
to regain the use of his body. Although the government admitted he
wasn't a drug dealer, they threatened to charge him with attempted
murder for the shots he fired at the door in self-defense. Then a
federal judge sealed the search warrant for the raid, preventing him
from even learning why he had been targeted by the government in the
first place.

Carlson retained an attorney who filed a $20 million suit over the
botched drug raid in December 1992. The government stalled, failing to
even so much as respond to any court papers until ordered to do so by a
judge. In 1995, after years of contentious negotiations, the government
finally settled the case for $2.7 million. Carlson took the money and
moved away from California to a gated community north of Dallas. He
still has trouble breathing and a problem with his leg due to the
gunshot wound. His doctor tells him the injuries will almost certainly
shorten his life.

Seven years after the raid, Carlson still could not believe he was
almost killed because of a lying snitch who had cut a deal with the
government. "[Edmonds] was a low-level street dealer, part-time criminal
who created this thing to get money out of them," he told the Post-Gazette.

For countless years, the line that "If you haven't done anything wrong,
you don't have anything to be afraid of" has been used by law
enforcement officials to trick people into bowing to warrantless
searches and interrogations without their lawyers present. Ex-President
Clinton used a variation on this a few days after two disturbed
teenagers, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, shot up Columbine High School
on April 20,1999. Speaking to a group of students at Virginia high
school, Clinton urged them to report any classmates who exhibit
anti-social behavior. "They won't get in trouble if they didn't do
anything wrong," he assured them.

Clinton was dead wrong. Innocent people are routinely arrested, tried,
convicted and sent to jail. Hundreds of convicts have been proven
innocent and set free in the last few decades, including close to 90 who
were sitting on Death Row waiting to be executed for murders they didn't
commit. "With little money available to dig up new evidence and appeals
courts usually unwilling to review claims of innocence (they are more
likely to entertain possible procedural trial-court errors), it's
impossible to know just how many other prisoners are living the ultimate
nightmare," Newsweek said in its June 2000 Special Report.

Even convicted killers who are not ultimately proven innocent frequently
have their convictions overturned on appeal, according to a study
conducted by a team of layers and criminologists at Columbia University.
Led by law professor James S. Liebman, the study reviewed all appeals
from 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, to
1995. It found that two out of three convictions were overturned on
appeal. Seventy-five percent of those who had their sentences set aside
were later given lesser sentences after retrials, in plea bargains or by
order of a judge.

Many of those released from Death Row in recent years were exonerated by
the Innocence Project, a New York-based public interest law firm started
by famed criminal defense attorney Barry Scheck. The organization used
newly developed DNA tests to prove they didn't do the crimes of which
they were convicted. Several of these former inmates appeared at the
National Conference on Wrongful Convictions and the Death Penalty,
sponsored by a number of anti-death penalty organizations in early 1999.
The conference examined many cases of innocent people who had been
wrongly convicted of capital crimes and sentenced to death. In almost
every instance, the conviction was based on perjured testimony from
actual criminals seeking reduced charges or preferential treatment. Some
snitches lied to avoid the death penalty for their own killings. In each
case, it took many years for the wrongly-convicted defendants to clear
their names.

As University of California law professor Clifford S. Zimmerman put it,
"Information mishandling and misconduct victimizes many innocent people.
Examples of the resulting harm include: prosecutions based upon
informant perjury; false arrests due to unreliable informants;
non-disclosure of informant information by prosecutors in criminal
proceedings; informant abuses promoted through rewards; and felonious
activity committed with the knowledge and, at time, assent of the police
and prosecutors."

University of Oregon law professor Garret Epps is more blunt: "The truth
is, everyone has something to hide. For most people, it's not a crime;
it may be a health condition that could expose them to discrimination,
and unfashionable political allegiance, a deeply held personal religious
commitment, a painful family secret or jut a juvenile sense of humor.
For each of us, there is something we choose not to share with people we
do not know well. And when these personal foibles are stripped bare, the
people exposed often feel a deep sense of violation and may lose
friends, jobs or spouses."

Theoretically, the Constitution and numerous Supreme Court rulings
provide the necessary safeguards. Grand juries are supposed to
double-check prosecutors, preventing them from bringing flimsy cases
based on questionable testimony. Numerous Supreme Court rulings are
intended to ensure that trials are fair and open. One of the most
significant safeguards is the so-called Brady Rule, adopted by the
Supreme Court in 1963. Under this rule, prosecutors must turn over to
defendants any evidence which might help prove their innocence or show
biases and criminal records of the witnessed used against them.

However, in these days of interlocking computer databases, simply
reporting someone to the authorities can destroy their lives. Consider
what is happening to African Americans. The crack cocaine scare of the
1980's prompted police agencies across the country to build computer
lists of African American gang members. The lists quickly expanded to
include other, far more ambiguous categories, including gang associates,
gang affiliates and even "gang affected" juveniles.

Much of the information put into the computers was unverified gossip
picked up during routine patrols. A mere accusation was all it took to
open a file. If the police pulled over a car driven by a "suspected"
gang member, all of the passengers became gang "associates." If a
boastful teenager claimed to be in a gang, that's what the police
accepted, with all of this brothers and sisters becoming "associates,"
"affiliates" or "affected" by his claimed membership. No one bothered to
double-check the allegations; the information just went straight into
the computers.

This same system is in play now across the country. Even in the
underground "Straight Edge" music scene in Salt Lake City, Utah,
overzealous and over-armed Police form "Anti-Gang Taskforces." "Straight
Edge" emerged in the early 1980's from the hardcore punk-rock music
scene. Disenfranchised youth eschewed drug use, alcohol, smoking and
promiscuity. This was viewed as "counter-culture" - an extension of its
outgrowth of the punk scene - and became symbolized in the wearing of an
"X" on the fist; as clubs that served alcohol wear these bands would
play would put an "X" on the hand of anyone underage, in order to make
it clear that no alcohol could be served to them.

Straight Edgers began showing up to these venues already "X-ed up." From
this different sub-categories would later emerge. However, in the mid,
to late 1990's the "Anti-Gang" Salt Lake City Police would define this
subculture as a "gang." Many of these "gang" members were completely
non-violent people, many girls, even the daughter of the HEAD of the
Anti-Gang taskforce was "Straight Edge." But ALL were lumped into this
category and given the designation of "gang members."

Similar rules were applied to these individuals as were applied to
African American's in other cities. Perhaps it is because of Salt Lake
City's notoriety for not having a large African American population.
African descended peoples were not permitted into the Mormon priesthood
until as late as June 9, 1978! So in the absence of this "external"
enemy of the Police State, the Mormon Rangers; armed with assault rifles
in each of their trunks, even Hummers and there very own "Anti-Gang
Taskforce" - since gang violence is OBVIOUSLY such a rampant problem in
Utah (note the sarcasm) - internalized their war on Freedom, and battle
for "Total Information Awareness" (as the Bush Administration would
later coin it).

More recently, the Bush administration said on Wednesday, May 26th that
it had credible intelligence suggesting that Al-Qa'ida is planning to
attack the United States in the next several months, a period in which
events like an international summit meeting and the two political
conventions could offer tempting targets.

Attorney General John Ashcroft said at a news conference that
intelligence reports and public statements by people associated with
Al-Qa'ida suggested that the terrorist group was "almost ready to attack
the United States" and harbored a "specific intention to hit the United
States hard."

However, some intelligence officials, terrorism experts - and to some
extent even Mr. Ashcroft's own FBI director, Robert S. Mueller III -
offered a more tempered assessment, saying, "For the next few weeks we
have reason to believe there is a heightened threat to the U.S.
interests around the world.'' U.S. "interests" or the U.S.... which is it?

The "interests" of the U.S. Government are very often not the
"interests" of the American people. So are we being told that there is
an imminent threat to OUR lives, or the lives of, perhaps, "Israeli's?"
Frankly, there are many Americans who do not care about the latter,
regardless of what the "interests" of the Bush Administration are.

"There's no real new intelligence, and a lot of this has been out there
already," said one administration official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. "There really is no significant change that would require us
to change the alert level of the country."

John Ashcroft said the government did not have any information about
where the terrorists might strike, and he said there was "extraordinary"
security being put in place for events like a summit meeting of
international leaders next month in Savannah, Ga., the Democratic
convention in Boston in late July and the Republican convention in New
York in late August and early September.

So what exactly was the point?

Ashcroft called for greater "public vigilance," especially in "looking
out" for seven people sought by the FBI who are suspected of being
Al-Qa'ida members or "sympathizers."

Now the puzzle pieces begin to come together... We are not "looking out"
for REAL "terrorists." We are looking out for those who may only
"sympathize" with criminals. Basically, we are being asked to spy on our
neighbors and report anything and anyone who does not fit into the
cookie-cutter mold of Western Christianity.

i'm like a lot of people i have met throughout the years. When i see
movies like "Goodfellas" or "Heat," i have a strange "sympathy" for the
main characters. Yes, i "sympathize" with these concocted members of
organized crime. When i see a police chase on the news, i generally
"sympathize" with the guy fleeing arrest, provided he hasn't hurt anyone.

Why do i "sympathize" with them? It's anyone's guess isn't it? Maybe
it's because i hate the Police State that is common to myself and that
person on the TV screen SO MUCH that i sympathize with even criminals
trying to elude capture from the Police State that i know also arrests,
and in some cases frames, citizens whose only crime is political
dissent. So for THIS should i be charged with money laundering? With
extortion? With racketeering? With any number of charges related to
organized crime? Of course not. "Sympathizing" with something does not
imply guilt of said thing, anymore than it implies that Mick Jagger is
the devil.

The official said, there was "no real new intelligence." So does that
mean that we just found out this information against these "suspects"
based on "new FAKE intelligence?" What did we find it out from if there
was "no real new intelligence?" Is the implication that we knew
everything we know about these individuals before? Why then are we only
now hearing about these dangerous "potential terrorists?"

In reality, we are not being told to look out for SPECIFIC people at
all. Of the seven people Ashcroft asked the public and law enforcement
agencies to watch out for, the only one whose name had not been
previously released was Adam Yahiye Gadahn, 25, who officials said is an
American citizen from California.

Adam Gadahn converted to Islam and is believed to have attended
Al-Qa'ida training camps in Afghanistan several years ago, officials
said. He is "thought" to have done "translation work for Al-Qa'ida" and
was "associated" with Abu Zubayda, a senior Al-Qa'ida associate now
imprisoned by the United States, they said.

Remember those dubious categories, including gang "associates," gang
"affiliates" and "gang affected" juveniles? Here they have popped up
again; Doublespeak for the New World Order. Adam Gadahn was "thought" to
have been an "associate" of Abu Zubayda, who was himself a senior
"associate" of "Al-Qa'ida;" an organization ranking only 17th out of 20
before 9.11.2001 in terms of potential danger to the U.S. Interestingly
"Al-Qa'ida" (the Base), was just the name of `Usama bin Ladin's old
house; a meeting place for his particular "gang." Maybe someday Law
Enforcement will catch on and start referring to the dangerous "Crib"
terrorists (based on a group of criminals meeting at eat other's "Crib"
before committing crimes).

How do we know that Adam Gadahn is a member of "The Crib" or
"Al-Qa'ida?" Is translating something now a terrorist act? Translating?
We are not to believe he was translating any special information that
would help to harm America citizens. We are not being asked to believe
that he was translating plans to murder innocent civilians. No, he
translated what were likely just pamphlets and small texts. Nothing that
could do any more harm to American citizens than giving someone a paper
cut, perhaps.

Maybe these texts had nothing to do with killing Americans at all.
Maybe... that is, MOST LIKELY they were merely political in nature;
against the U.S. military presence in the Hijaz, Afghanistan and Iraq,
or against the so-called state of "Israel." So because he translated
something, because he agreed with the politics of some written words and
then translated it for others to READ, for others to THINK about, he is
now a card carrying member of a terrorist organization? This is a
ridiculous and baseless claim.

At least two of these seven terrorists identified by John Ashcroft as
part of an "Al-Qa'ida cell" that is waiting to attack America this
summer are already in jail. A respected website that holds databases on
terror suspects lists Amer El-Maati as "incarcerated."

http://www.trackingthethreat.com/db/ENT1711.htm

Likewise, Aafia Siddiqui, a female former MIT student, was arrested in
Pakistan over a year ago, according to NBC.

http://www.intellnet.org/news/2003/04/03/19137-1.html

The "cell" that these individuals are said to belong to doesn't even
exist. The Abu Hafs al-Masri group was described by the Boston Globe as
a "phantom organization." Their researchers could find no evidence that
the group was real. Imagine that; dishonest Big Government. Who would
have thought?

http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/03/13/officials_group_tying_self_to_blasts_may_not_be_real/


Each time a new terror threat is announced or a terror suspect is
"captured," we discover that they have either already been arrested or
they have been dead for a year or more. That is, except for the 9.11
suspects; many of whom are alive and well in foreign countries (despite
allegedly having blown themselves up in the fiery inferno of the World
Trade Center and Pentagon). What's that, you are noticing some
inconsistencies? Never mind that, the last episode of "Friends" is on
the television. The "WB" has a new spin off of American Idol. What are
you doing wasting time reading the paranoid delusions of a Thought
Criminal who is probably a terrorist himself? Get back to the "real"
world of Rueben Stutter and Clay Aiken. Pay no attention to the man
behind the curtain.

In his press conference, John Ashcroft cited a number of upcoming events
that "could be" "potential" targets, including the Group of Eight
economic summit on Sea Island, Georgia, and the Democratic and
Republican national conventions in Boston, Massachusetts, and New York,
respectively. If i was a gambling man, i'd wager everything i have that
none of these WILL BE ACTUAL targets.

Ashcroft also warned that terrorists may not have a typical look and
that "the face of al Qa'ida may be changing."

It "may be changing" or it "is changing." Please let us know Mr.
Ashcroft. i don't want to worry about it if it is only a "maybe." Only
if it is something which there is credible evidence of will i worry
myself into a fit of orange and red alerts over it. If not then keep
your mouth shut and stop trying to frighten the public into electing Bush.

"Our intelligence confirms al-Qa'ida is seeking recruits who can portray
themselves as Europeans," he said.

http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/05/26/terror.threat/index.html

So never mind all of the years of justification for the racial profiling
of Arabs and people traditionally thought to be Muslim. Now you should
look at EVERYONE as a potential terrorist.

Ashcroft said the group adapts quickly to new security measures and may
be recruiting operatives in their late 20s or early 30s and "may travel
with families to lower their profile."

Again, never mind the "Homeland Security" paranoia of UNmarried Muslims
- you know the ones who were supposed to be unmarried because they were
going to blow themselves and others up at any moment - now you should
also be suspicious of Muslims with families... Basically, just consider
ANY Muslim a potential terrorist, right?

Strangely, Ashcroft said in this same press conference that of these
seven "all pose a clear and present danger to America" and "should be
considered armed and dangerous."

http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/05/26/terror.threat.transcript/index.html

What "clear" and "present" danger do these individuals pose? What "clear
and present danger" do Amer El-Maati and Aafia Siddiqui present to us
behind bars, since both have been imprisoned long before Ashcroft told
us to call in tips as to their whereabouts? What is "clear" about this
danger? What is "present" about a danger that has already passed? What
"danger" exactly does Adam Gadahn pose to us... "clearly" that is? Is he
going to translate us to death? He is considered "armed and dangerous"
with what? A pen and paper? A computer? Armed with "sympathy" for the
enemies of the United States?

What is the meaning of this then? CNN inadvertently illustrates this in
their follow up news report which headlines "Thousands of tips received
on suspected seven; FBI: 'Please keep them coming'."

The report reads: "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The FBI has received more than
2,000 tips from the public in the 24 hours after a news conference
asking for help in locating seven people Attorney General John Ashcroft
called al-Qa'ida operatives.

"'Many thanks for your help on locating those pictured below,' the FBI
Web site said Thursday. 'Over 2,000 tips were sent by mid-afternoon
today on tips.fbi.gov alone. Please keep them coming.'"

http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/05/27/terror.threat/index.html

So there are seven of these guys... Two of them are already in prison
and were in prison before the press conference. So five of them really.
 From these five there yielded more than 2,000 tips. So that is 400 tips
for each one of these people. Do you think that ANY of these tips was
ACTUALLY related to the individuals in question? i don't. If they were
then they certainly were not very good tips as the FBI is still left
empty handed... except for those two suspects which they had all along.

Furthermore, New York City and Los Angeles officials told Reuters that
they had not been informed by the government of any terror threat,
despite the fact that people like Ashcroft and Ridge are all over the
media fear mongering about the inevitability of an attack before the
election.

http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=KX1FUUUBRY3B2CRBAEKSFEY?type=domesticNews&storyID=5265538
<http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=KX1FUUUBRY3B2CRBAEKSFEY?type=domesticNews&storyID=5265538>


So what is this all about? It is about a society of spies and snitches
not unlike that of the Orwellian world of 1984 where political
dissidents even feared talking in their sleep. It is about fear tactics
that make people afraid to live. It is about a Big Brother, Orwellian,
Ashcroftian Big Federalist Government that preys on the fear of
terrorism it both orchestrates and brings upon itself by inciting the
hatred of the world through its corrupt foreign policies, support for
brutal regimes and dictators and use of weapons of mass destruction. It
is about locking people up and throwing away the key if they
"sympathize" with those who oppose the Bush Regime... that is,
Administration.

The 5th Amendment to U.S. Constitution reads: "No person shall be held
to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a
presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in
the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in
time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the
same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be
compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor
shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."

Yet on June 9, 2002 Jose Padilla (`Abd'ullah Al-Muhajir), was
transferred from control of the U.S. Department of Justice to military
control. Since that time, Padilla has been held in a Navy brig in South
Carolina. Padilla has not been charged with a crime, and does not have
access to a lawyer in his detention. This is a clearly abominable
violation of the democratic traditions purportedly upheld by the United
States. This is a clear violation of the 5th Amendment, and a violation
of the 6th Amendment (which reads):

"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a
speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district
wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have
been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and
cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against
him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor,
and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense."

Padilla has been accused of plotting acts of terrorism, particularly the
setting off of a "dirty bomb;" something which no one, no where has EVER
even made so much as a prototype of. He has been accused of conspiring
with members of... that's right, you guessed it, the Boogyman,
catch-all, terrorist organization: al-Qa'ida, and planning to scout for
that terrorist organization, using the benefits of his U.S. citizenship.
President Bush has designated Padilla an "enemy combatant;" meaning that
the Bush Regime can do whatever the Hell they want to and with him and
there isn't a damned thing you can do about it... (unless you are a
"terrorist" as well, in which case you're next).

These are frightening accusations, and they may very well be true.
However, accusations do not give the President the authority to lock
someone away. According to the laws and traditions of the U.S., the way
to determine who gets imprisoned is through the due process of a trial
by jury. So much for that though. In this Brave New World, individual
guilt is determined by the Administration. "Democracy" is brought to
foreign lands by way of ousting an elected President and then APPOINTING
a President that the Administration likes. Or for that matter, in this
Brave New World, the President loses the popular vote by over half a
million votes and is then APPOINTED to the Presidency by the Supreme Court!

Jose Padilla may be a traitor and he may even be a terrorist. However,
he was not captured in Afghanistan with a gun in his hand. He was
arrested at Chicago O'Hare airport. If Jose Padilla can be held without
criminal charges, strictly on the say-so of the President, then any
American can be. That is tyranny and that is not the "America" many of
us were sold in school.

But prosecution for "terrorism" is not what the government has in mind
for Padilla. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that Padilla may
NEVER face trial.

"Our interest is not in trying him and punishing him, our interest is in
finding out what he knows."

http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/06/11/dirty.bomb.suspect/

If he was REALLY planning on bombing Americans then why wouldn't we want
him to be charged with a crime and be tried and punished? Obviously this
admission makes it clear that this man never did ANYTHING, but obviously
is being illegally detained by a Police State until he tells them the
things that they want to hear.

How did Padilla come to be in this situation that he finds himself in?
The first tip about "dirty bomb" suspect Jose Padilla came about two
weeks before his May 8 arrest, U.S. officials said.

Officials said the information came from senior al-Qa'ida operative Abu
Zubaydah, who is being held in U.S. custody. Zubaydah provided a
physical description of Padilla but did not name him, officials said.

A U.S. official said that Zubaydah appeared to be giving out minimal
information, apparently assuming that authorities would not be able to
figure out whom he was describing. Perhaps the fact that he was shot in
the testicles might have had something to do with the "minimal
information" he was giving out? Or perhaps, just like Ronnie Edmond, he
was making up a story to buy himself time, so when they found out that
he was making the whole thing up, he could then just invent another lie.
Maybe Jose Padilla is just like Don Carlson. How can we tell? We can't.
That's why American Law has maintained the criteria of guilt that one is
"Innocent until PROVEN guilty." If Padilla is guilty, then the
government should prove it. They should at least bring charges and
evidence against him. The fact that they have not PROVES THEIR guilt;
that THEY are guilty of falsely and ILLEGALLY imprisoning American
citizens based on nothing but the hearsay of a terrorist trying to save
himself, taking the spotlight off of his own crimes and pointing it onto
someone else that he could not even produce so much as a name for.

U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials took the vague
description from Abu Zubaydah and then questioned other captured
al-Qa'ida prisoners; using an FBI database to find the names of the
suspect and another man - believed to be Pakistani - who is being held
in Pakistan in connection with the same alleged plot to attack targets
in the United States. Once they had the names, U.S. officials then
obtained photographs of the two suspects and showed them to Zubaydah. He
confirmed they were the two men involved, officials said.

http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/06/11/dirty.bomb.zubaydah/index.html

That's all it took. That and a one page letter from the President
stripping this American citizen of his Constitutionally "guaranteed"
rights. All based upon hearsay from a man who is himself a criminal. A
criminal who was shot in the testicles and blackmailed; "If you want
some more painkillers, medical treatment, whatever, then you will give
us some names, faces, anything"

This is the world we are living in. There is no question as to the way
things are. This is reality. The question is, what are you going to do
about it?

I don't know if I agree with your assessment of
the success of alan's strategy, but I do want to
point out that I'm not kvetching about it as so
many others have, only positing a solution for
those who are bugged by receiving his poems. I
rarely have the temerity to dip into a Sondheim,
but when I do, I've variously been bored,
intrigued, amused, or annoyed, depending on my
mood and the tone of the piece.

I do think we're venturing into fairly new
territory with the proliferation of all these
lists, blogs, and whatnot -- there really is no
limit to how much cybercrud can come washing into
your box every day. Poets like Alan push the
envelope by their very prolificacy as much as
their hybrid forms; I don't know if I'd relish
receiving daily poems from even a poet I LOVE, let
alone one I'm ambivalent about. And speaking only
for myself, a poem in a flat white e-mail with
lots of gobbledygook around it is probably the
least appealing way to encounter it. Given that
the FACT of receiving his daily missives is at
least as irritating to some as HOW he writes them,
I wonder how innovative etc. this actually makes
him. But I don't have the answer.

Alan Sondheim must be doing something right,
because there's more discussion on at least his
strategy than on anyone else on this list. The
measure of his success is that, like all
progressive artists of the past, he exasperates
and irritates some people. Whether his work will
be known a decade from now is in question, as it
is for everyone's work. But by being
overproductive, Alan forces the issue of neglect.

Hussam was sitting at home when he was shot in the face, chest, back, legs.
He had nothing to do with any violent or even political movement. Hussam's

Laila, Jamil's sister weeping when she heard what
happened to her brother who was killed

He insisted on putting the Palestinian flag amidst the rubble of his
demolished house in Block "O" area in Rafah refugee Camp, and an Israeli
soldier responded with 7 bullets in different parts of his body. 17 year old
Jamil Al Farmawi died, as Israel refused to give permission to the ambulance
to bring his body back to his family, and let it stay in the rubble of his
house for 24 hours.

Al Framwai family is still living in a shelter in UNRWA school. His family
consists of 33 members all of whom live in the classroom of Al Khansa school
after demolishing their home in Block "O" area.

His mother was overwhelmed with sadness when she heard about the killing of
her son under the rubble of their demolished home..

At the same moment of Al Farmwai funeral, shooting continued near the
borderline and a 4 year old boy was killed..

Over 15 tanks, 4 bulldozers and two apache warplanes participated in the
latest heavy incursion leaving 22 demolished houses in Al Brazil and Al
Salam neighborhood, and 4 houses in Al Shuaa't district in Rafah.

Palestinian sources said there were 36 new families among the homeless
families sheltered in schools.

Abu Mohammed Al Shaer (50), a man living in a school, said that as soon as
the bulldozers and the
tanks invaded the camp they all went to hide inside their houses, but a few
hours later they were surprised that tens of soldiers with their police dogs
invaded their homes, insulting and abusing them.

"They left the house but not before destroying the furniture," he said.

In the early morning, around 6 o'clock in the morning a very loud bomb
exploded in one of the buildings, then the tanks and bulldozers withdrew
from the invaded areas.

Rafah Municipality, relief teams and medical workers went quickly to the
area and found that the bulldozers succeeded in breaking water pipes, and
now there is a mixture of clean drinking water and the sewage system water.
In an interview with the manger of water and sewage system department at
Rafah municipality, Ashraf Ghoneem, he said: "Our workers went in the early
morning to fix problem before a health crisis occurs. It is clear that the
Israeli Army deliberately made such troubles in the infrastructure."

Waving the Japanese flag

"Hey boys listen! I have a brilliant idea to get out our hand-carts, it's
the Japanese flag which might be the only that which finds respect from the
troops and can stop the shooting at us "said one of the 10 boys who was
protesting an Israeli bulldozer trying to destroy their hand- carts that
they use to help in carrying the passenger's baggage and get some money in
return 1 shekel (20% of 1 US dollar).

"That hand-cart is my life and destroying it means destroying my family's
life as well" said one of the children who could not continue his speech to
me because three bullets hit the wall that was only two meters away from us.

The children began encouraging the idea of holding the Japanese flag. They
found it the only hope that might keep them safe, stop the shooting towards
them and bring the hand-carts.

Unfortunately, the Japanese flag did not protect them, because when they
came closer to the Israeli militant jeep and the bulldozer which was
breakikng their hand-carts, the soldiers in the jeep began shooting towards
them. Nevertheless the children insisted more and more and got closer and
closer to the jeep to bring their hand-carts, but a loudspeaker came from
the jeep in broken Arabic accent saying: "Leave from here or I will shoot
you." The boy answered:" Not without my cart.? Hilmi, a 14 year old boy
answered. The soldier again asked the boy to leave but he answered him
answered him by saying:? It's my family's only income, the only way I can
bring food to them all.?

The bullets came of course and they all had to flee with the militanry jeep
following them and surrounding them in an olive grove. All the children had
to then flee from the olive grove and to jump out of that high
iron bar and barbed wires. The boys were all able to escape.

Injured people from the people who were participating in the
demonstration against Musa Arafat appointment as a general chief in Gaza
Strip and West Bank

It is nearly 8:20 in the evening and getting darker. A demonstration is just
strating after militant groups sparked a serious internal PA crisis, that
moved to the streets. Thousands demonstrated against the newly appointed
head of national security. Thousands demonstrated Saturday night in Rafah,
protesting against
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat?s decision to appoint his nephew Musa
Arafat as the head of national security forces. Protesters accused Musa
Arafat of corruption. Under the pressure of a series of abductions, Arafat
decided to unify all of his security devices in 3 only: police, national
security, and intelligence. Arafat replaced Ghazi Jabali, who earlier on
Friday was abducted and then released, with Saeb Al-Ajez. Appointing his
nephew Musa Arafat as the head of national security created an uproar within
Fatah, and among the public in Gaza Strip.

14 people were in the clashes between demonstrators and PA loyal member to
Mussa Arafat in the Palestinian Authority.

Tens of demonstrators tried to torch Rafah inelligence headquarters during
clashes by exchange fire and stones between the masked and angry people from
the militant Fateh wing Al Aqsa Brigades and some loyal and supporters of
the newly appointed chief intelligence Musa Arafat, and they continued the
whole last night and ended by 14 facilities including Reuter?s photographer
Ahmed Baba.

A similar demonstration took place by Fateh movement's angry people and
others in all the camps of Gaza City, as in Khanyounis, demonstrators
torched the intelligence headquarters. The demonstrators accused the newly
appointed chief Musa Arafat by corruption.

In Khanyounis also Abu Arish wing in Fateh movement announced that four
French workers were kidnapped from the headquarters of the Palestinian Red
Crescent Society in the center of the town. A few hours later, the same wing
released the four French people under pressure from President Aarfat, as the
mentioned wing excused that kind of kidnapped as ? a way of pressure on
Arafat to remove some corrupted chief in
Gaza?

Musa Arafat said to the journalists in Gaza during a press conference that
he does not intend to resign, describing the protests against his
appointment as a summer cloud that will disappear soon.

On the political side, The commander of Palestinian navey Juma Ghali, the
head of the Preventive Security, Rashid Abu Shbak, and commander of the
General Security Amin Al-Hindi, submitted their resignation in protest to
the appointment of Musa Arafat.

This morning, President Arafat response to the Gaza Strip?s street by
annulling the appointment of Mussa Arafat as a national security chief of
Gaza Strip and West Bank and replaced Musa Aarfat by the previous chief
Abedelrzek Al Majaedeh.

Injured child at Abu Yousif Al Najjar hospital in Rafah.
He was injusted during random shelling at buildings


A 16 year old girl has been killed by Israeli bullets in Rafah during the
daily shelling in Rafah.. Right before dawn we heard ambulances near Al
Shboura neighborhood in Rafah Camp carrying injured people during the random
shelling..

Abu Yousif Al Najjar hospital said that 16 year old girl Halima Abu
Samhadanah was shot in the chest, while a few other people were also injured
in the same area as a result of rockets falling on civilian buildings in AL
Shaboura camp which is one kilometer away from the borderline.

Slowly killing us

"They are killing us slowly with that crossing point" said an old woman
waiting in the crossing point of Rafah. She had been waiting there for many
days under the hot sunshine in order to travel to Egypt for an urgent heart
surgery.

Rafah crossing point is the only place where people of Gaza Strip can get
out. Everyday hundreds of people wait there for permission to travel abroad.




Rafah children hiding during an incursion

---------------------------------

11 July 04



The IOF attacked Rafah from the South, Khanyounis in the Middle and Beit
Hanon in the South of Gaza Strip. Everywhere you go, you find the effects of
the Israeli offensive in
all Gaza. The Israeli troops invaded Al Brazil Camp by Apache warplanes with
over 15 tanks and 4 bulldozers leaving 5 demolished buildings and a large
number of demolished shops.

Four women and a child were injured during random shelling from Israeli
posts based on the borderline. Tahani Keshta (30) injured in her leg,
Halimah Nana (26) by an explosive bullet in different parts of her body,
Alia Al Romi (22) injured in her backbone, and 65 year old Suad Fujuo
injured in her left leg and left bleeding for along time bleeding on the
ground.

Medical sources in Abu Youisf Al Najjar said that 4 year old Sahar Fujuo was
injured in her head. In addition Osama Saker (24), and Anas Abu Armanah (26)
were also injured..

In Rafah now there is a military buildup with more militanry tanks and
bulldozers, in addition to the apaches and the fires that they shoot at
night? "They demolished my house, but they will never destroy my will," a 38
year old man said while collecting what remained from his demolished
building in Al Brazil camp in Rafah..

"What is your message to the world?" I asked an old woman who was busy
collecting what remained from her demolished building. She answered: "I have
been talking and for so long complaining and
appealing to the world but there are no results and not even a condemnation
at least."

From the catastrophe of damaged Rafah to Khanyounis, where Israeli military
troops invaded Al Nimsawi neighborhood and the Western Camp and demolished
25 houses and many people were injured and
killed..

The began in a late hours late hours by shelling the civilians homes by
Apaches and not allowing ambulances to transfer the injured and killed
people into hospitals..

This morning also in Khanyounis, the Israeli military forces killed a 14
year old boy, Hamadah Al Shaer. Al Shaer was killed in his house during
shelling from the Israeli settlement of Jaded which is based in Khanyounis.

Ten people were killed!!

In Biet Hanon, there was a real massacre and it is continuing up till now by
Apache warplanes, bulldozers and tanks. They killed 10 people and tens of
people were injured, in addition to a very large numbers of demolished
houses and trees.. Those who were killed during the incursion are: Yusif Al
Zanin, Naim Al Kafarnah, Naser Aldeen Abu Harbid, Zaher Abu Harbid, Nahed
Abu Awdah, Hamed Abu Awdah, Jamil Al Kafarnah and Jamilah Al Kafarnah, in
addition to two unidentified bodies.

Eyewitnesses say that the Israeli Occupation Forces are invading Beit Hanon
for the 9th day and people are not permitted to get out of their homes, in
addition to more killing and injured people.

Running out of food and water

Beit Hanon has no food, water, nor electricity, and is under complete
militanry closure. People are not allowed to get out from their homes to
bring food...

Israeli troops are still invading Beit Hanon up till this moment and the
area has so many killed and injured people who cannot go to hospitals
because ambulances and relief workers are unable to get to the injured and
dead..

Breaking News by phone from one of the journalists there:

"The Israeli bulldozers and tanks are coming towards Jabalya Refugee Camp.
Israeli Apaches are shelling buildings right now, and soldiers are occupying
the house of Nasser Al Zanin and had turned it into a
militanry barrack."

A father was injured with his child and another man in a shelling that
targeted a white Mercedes taxi, which was in Salaheldeen Street in Gaza
City.. Two rockets fell from the Israeli warplanes towards the taxi, leaving
the three injured: 5 year old Mohammed Amjad Jaber, his father Amjad Youisf
Jaber (32), and (30) year old Ibrahim Tabet.

Talking about evacuation plan from Gaza

The media is now publishing about the Israeli pull out from the Gaza Strip.
The Israeli military forces just began digging a new street near Kfar Daroom
settlement, in addition to closing Abu Holi checkpoint and forcing people to
stand under the hot sunshine. They also arrested 6 people at the
checkpoint..

6 July 2004



The moment that Yassir's father arrived the hospital after he has been told
about the killing of his son, as some relatives trying to help him after he
fell down when he saw his son dead



Misery, blood, tears, suffering, blackness, sorrow and fear


The difficult moment of farewell: Yassir's sister after she arrived at the
hospital mourning her brother who was taken to the morgue of Abu Youissf Al
Najjar hospital.










Misery, blood, tears, suffering, blackness, sorrow and fear and real
catastrophe, which no one has seen before nor any mind can imagine. I don?t
know what to do or how to begin to describe what I have seen in the past few
days in Rafah and especially for the family of Yassir Al Arja (25) killed by
the Israelis in random shelling. I'm afraid that I might not do this family
justice by not conveying their feelings that day when
they received the news that their son was killed..

Farewell:

Farewells break the hearts and minds. This family is considered one of the
poorest families in Rafah..
Yassir's sister arrived at the hospital hitting herself after she heard the
news that her brother was killed by the Israeli Occupation Forces.. His
mother, father and brother where grieving and weeping the whole day..

Yassir was killed while helping his relatives take out what remained of
their damaged furniture. He was killed immediately in the rubble of the
building..

Yassir's mother arrived the hospital crying and saying: "For 25 years I have
been bringing him up and his end comes with a cheap bullet?"

He was playing soccer:

A few hours before Yassir's murder, 9 year old Mohamed Zaran was killed
while playing football.. His friend in the hospital said: "He was kicking
the ball in the other goal but had no time because while holding the ball,
the bullet was faster."

The child was weeping while telling his stroy:" We were playing soccer and a
bullet hit Mohammed leaving him on the ground where made there was a large
pool of blood."

Mohammed wanted to be an international football player to represent
Palestine in the world cup when he grew up.

Massacres again!!!!!!!

As usual Apache warplanes did not leave Rafah's skies. The IOF targeted Al
Brazil neighborhood in Rafah, leaving 16 completely and partially demolished
buildings, 7 shops, and also electricity providers. Many more were injured
and dead.

This morning, thousands of people participated in the funeral of two people
who were killed by the IOF: 4 year old Hayam Al Saher, and 28 year old
Refaat Abu Amrah..

Ten minutes ago, a Palestinian lady, Samah Al Shaer was injured in her right
leg and transferred to the hospital, and a young man Abdelsalam Al Jarbou
was injured in his left arm. Those two civilians were injured during the
continuous shelling in the buildings. No ones knows what the night carry for
Rafah families... you might have seen someone in the street, but don?t be
surprised if you find the next day
his/her funrel. Killing people has become a normal thing...

---------------------------------

1 July 2004

By telephone from Mohammed: The IDF demolished the internet providers and
now there is no internet at all in Gaza Strip - in addition to lack of
electricity. Also most of the phones are damaged and Gaza strip is divided
into three parts. Lack of food.

I agree with Joel. And for that Lori's stance. Besides his texts, I, for
one, enjoy how Alan angers so many with his posts. I find it reassuring to
see his texts everyday, it's like seeing the newspaper has published another
edition, and it is, indeed a brand new day.

Hazah to Alan!

Best, Geoffrey

Subject:      In defense of Love like Rilke's
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

When discussing Love and Poetry recently with a friend,
she made the remark, "Men aren't capable of writing about
love as it actually exists, especially in poetry."

I believe I DID roll my eyes, and went on to defend Love
for any gender.  It made me crazy to think Love wouldn't
have a voice "as it actually exists" unless interpreted
through gender-specific lips.

"Rilke was a liar, for instance," she said.

This is the direction of the argument?  Yes, and to pour
concrete around it, Bell Hooks was quoted, slandering
Rilke's ability to get Love "as it actually exists."

When I challenged that NOT EVEN Bell Hooks would
make such a ridiculous statement about Rilke, I was
presented proof.  Here's a quote from her book
"all about love," published a couple of years ago:

"Men often write about love through fantasy, through
what they imagine is possible rather than what they
concretely know.  We know now that Rilke did not
write as he lived.  That so many words of love offered
us by great men fail us when we come face to face
with reality."

Is this argument real?  Is it really an argument might
be a better question.  Who CARES how Rilke may or
may not have lived his life.  And by the way, any
evidence either way would only be smearing highlights.
A poet is not the summation of highlights of his or her
life anymore than Bell Hooks is!

What?  Rilke didn't REALLY know about REAL love
because he wasn't gushing the goblet 24/7?

We are all of us constantly exchanging, transferring
and recreating an abundance of different emotional
responses to the world all day long.  It's impossible,
even archaic to box an individual into One emotional
category.  The best we have to go on is the most
examples of a particular emotion expressed.  But
none of this defines an entire life.

Not only that, it's simply too easy to put poets on the
chopping block because they didn't always live as some
THINK they SHOULD be.  Look at Pound for instance,
his entire life written off by some, as though he came
out of the womb screaming Heil Hitler!  Instead of
questioning how he lost his way for a time.  And what
about all those poems coming out of him when he
was loving/dating/SEEING H.D., etc...?

The injuries of this world constantly amaze, mostly
because they are where Love can be traced back to
its absence.  But NOT all the time, there's too much
in all of us to snap judge, and Bell Hooks of all humans
must be aware of these things.

Dear Bell Hooks, Rilke's words do not fail us.  But your
judgements fail Rilke, and poetry, and us.

I do NOT doubt Rilke saw how Love actually exists.
That he had concete experience to move his poems.
Without a doubt Pound also knew it.  No, not all the
time, just like any of us.  But man, I'd take Pound or
Rilke as my Love Daddy any day!  And yes, I'm
basing this on fantasy of how Love could be.
But it doesn't mean I have no concrete to
stand on.

Perhaps this arguement is generally a difference in how the two of you view
love in it's ideal expression ; perhaps this is a gendered thing.  Her
comment strikes me right off as not a serious comment about poetry, but
another arrow in the notorious "Battle of the Sexes."

> When discussing Love and Poetry recently with a friend,
> she made the remark, "Men aren't capable of writing about
> love as it actually exists, especially in poetry."

This seems to me to be, offhandedly, ridiculously sexist.  Men have been
writing poetry for thousands of years. . . and more of the most famous love
poems are by men. In any case, of the millions/billions of love poems
written by men, to evaluate them all as not-accurate, and men as "Not
Capable" seems outright ridiculous right away.

In fact she started out "Men aren't capable of writing about love as it
actually exists...", not even singling out poets.
I would guess that almost anyone who read a great deal would be able to
refute this, but continuing on...

I would vomit on the spot.

I think you've hit the nail on the head -- her love "as it actually exists"
is a gender specific idea, and therefore men don't seem to be able to write
about it.  Perhaps she should consider that love "as it actually exists"
isn't necessarily the same experience for everyone.

> "Rilke was a liar, for instance," she said.

This seems like another strange phrasing -- that something that is
"fantastical" or non-concrete, in the context of poetry, should be lying.

Can poetry lie?
Does poetry lie?

> This is the direction of the argument?  Yes, and to pour

I think she, like e.e. cummings, does not like her name to be capitalized.
("bell hooks")

Well, I suppose what they're saying is that Rilke's poetry is not an
expression of real feeling. And if one is looking for a poetry of "honesty",
then they might CARE. In any case, I don't think that even if Rilke did not
write how he lived, that makes him a liar -- no, that makes him a writer. If
you lie in your personal life or your letters, that it is far different from
telling a different story, a different narrative, in your work than is your
life.

I don't think that they're saying Rilke didn't know love, but that those
poems were not an expression of that love but of an ideal.

So what you're basically saying is what -- love is not a separable
"emotion"? It's difficult to figure out if Rilke loved someone?

I don't think if Rilke ever loved anyone is really the idea in question
here -- the idea in question is whether Rilke's work was a realistic (versus
fantastical) depiction of love, which obviously your female friend and bell
hooks agree it is not. Are you saying that it is realistic?

Facts are facts though, Pound was a fascist... and I would judge him quite a
bit for it.
After a good deal of musing on this subject, I personally think the life of
the poet is generally pretty irrelevant to the
worth of the art.

IN any case, I think your friend's supposition (not the "men aren't
capable") but rather the suggested "men/Rilke (tend to) write about love ina
fantastical /idealized way" has no real relation to any biographical look at
Rilke.

> The injuries of this world constantly amaze, mostly

I have no idea what you are saying -- that most of the world's evils come
from an absence of love? you are all over the page.

I think she was saying that the words fail women as a depiction of real
love. I don't know what poem(s) she's referencing to specifically, so Ic
an't say.

> I do NOT doubt Rilke saw how Love actually exists.

But if this is not displayed in his poetry (which you seem to agree to) --
how Love actually exists -- then how do you know?

All things considered, it sounds like you two were having a pretty silly
conversation -- she started off making a sexist statement then "proved" it
by mentioning "even" Rilke was a "liar". She backs this up with one woman's
quote saying that Rilke "fails us" as if this is proof for the entire male
sex. Every time she reads a book, does she let it overtake her brain???

*       *       *
Atticus/Finch is pleased to announce the release of its second chapbook:
Elizabeth Willis’ _Meteoric Flowers_.

Printed in an edition of 200 copies with elegantly letter-pressed
covers,_Meteoric Flowers_ is the first new work from Willis since
2003’s Turneresque.

In this new volume, Elizabeth Willis’ lyric maelstroms are at once
rooted in a lost pastoral economy, dripping with the lush language of
the green-world, “the horns of august, the / downward tree...The nerve-
like system in the page,” only to dismantle the bucolic from the inside
out.


Jack Collom writes of _Meteoric Flowers_:

Elizabeth Willis is one of the very best young writers in America. “The
word ‘delicious’ has never been redder.” That’s her, slicing delight
into danger, but we can say it of “Meteoric Flowers” too. Her prose-
poems are box-shaped but inside the box she accomplishes passionately
crazy-like-a-fox swirls and connections. Listen to her bop speech
rhythms: “Blossom machines. Sure, I’ll carry your latest worry, sorry
it’s not dripping in your favorite green” (from the title piece). Which
leads omnidirectionally to nature: Within the near-squares a whole lot
of curves are thrown: continual yokings of off-opposites, forming a
kind of surreal critique of ourselves vis-à-vis the rest of it. Solid
is suddenly revealed as liquid. Whipcracks occur but mystery lingers. A
book that leaves you gasping for more.”

And a word from Lisa Jarnot:

I think that these poems were written by William Blake upon his return
from deep space, or maybe they were written by my friend Elizabeth
Willis who moves at the speed of light and takes dictation from the
angels. It’s even possible that these meteoric flowers have descended
to permanently reconfigure the brain waves of all sentient life on
earth.

These chapbooks are only available via mail-order and only six bucks!
Geez!

I will be in New York for a conference from Sunday 7/25 to Thursday 7/29.
I'd appreciate any information about poetry readings & other events, art
exhibitions, etc., going on during that time. Does poetry fall into a deep
slumber during the summer months or . . .

Many thanks in advance for advice!

yes, i feel you're correct that hooks and my friend are
making the point from sexism

but then again, if all is fiction
well, what difference is gender?
(not saying this to say what your point was
but to further see how stupid the judgment)

i'm already aware of the argument that all
is fiction when dealing with writers
(i don't necessarily believe it always is
but i know poets who say it is)

one of the things that i found especially interesting
that Rilke --and Rumi by the way-- could be attacked
by hooks because they were male living in "fantasy"
and not coming to us from any "concrete" experience
of love (this is my biggest problem, her all-seeing eye)
yet she gives no examples of women poets who DO
give us all what men seem to lack

my point was that to have disdain for Rilke's poetry
on Love because of how he lived his life is what's silly

Love is too expansive to actually finger as "concrete"
or "fantasy"
who is to say that a fantasy is not based on some
concrete --missing space in a life
missing space because it had been filled possibly
Love is something we all want and hopefully
have or at least have had

and yes, Pound's support of fascism
was an awful thing.  but i brought up Pound
because to shuck his poems aside because
of political beliefs (and of course actions),
in a way, is a similar
argument that hooks is making, in that,
the man cannot be trusted to have actually
MEANT or FELT the things he wrote
based on information about the lived life.
she simplifies the human condition in
order to disregard

we now know --for instance-- a very different
view of Hitler, with this bizarre and extraordinary
documentary recently released on video, the
interview with his secretary.  i recommend that
everyone see it.  why?  because she brought him
out of the black and white footage, and made Hitler
scarier than ever in a way, because she made him
human, and of course it's much much easier and
comfortable to keep him at bay, keep him a demon.

and yes, bell hooks does write lower case,
it's just that it didn't seem to work at first, like
the name was a bunch of things:  bell hooks

her book CLASS MATTERS is very good by the way
and the first book she wrote that i was able to get
all the way through.  i feel that she really makes the
real arguments for what really divides this world when
she talks about class.  she has such courage when
writing on the subject, taking risks that run right into
the hand that feeds her.  i actually have a lot of respect
for her, i'm just annoyed with this subject of poets...

but of course sexism is hooks's main topic.  she and
Gloria Steinem differ on one very big note, and that is
that Steinem believes it's IMPOSSIBLE to liberate
women without liberating men at the exact same time

furthering Mina Loy's FEMINIST MANIFESTO here
with Steinem's idea, is that Loy was very right to argue
that all women were fighting for (and she wrote this a
LONG time ago) are to have the same employment as
men, to join the game, and that the real thing to "want"
(for Loy) was to destroy the system and start over.

Steinem's approach is more about all
of us building self esteem to the point where we don't
need this testosterone driven system.  make the system
obsolete in a sense, since the system is based on a lack
of self worth, on following the desires of a few, who even
give you the opportunity to believe you're fulfilling your own.

Steinem's book REVOLUTION FROM WITHIN is one
of the books that really could change the world, well,
it changed my world at least --let me just speak for myself

      Dear friend,

      You are one of the poets who published work at Poets Against the =
War sometime during the past 18 months.=20

      Now, a new feature-length documentary film - Poetry in Wartime -- =
has been created to tell the story of Poets Against the War as well as =
to distill the emotional essence of war and conflict through the lens of =
poetry. The film looks at war through images and the words of poets - =
both unknown and famous - to bring the experience of war into sharp =
focus- from the Poets Against the War movement and from Homer, Wilfred =
Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, Emily Dickinson, Langston Hughes, Walt Whitman =
and poets from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For more information about the =
film, please click here:

      Poetry in Wartime -- a Documentary Film
      to be released in September, 2004.


      or go to: http://poetryinwartime.org/.

      A new web site - Voices in Wartime -- has been launched to promote =
the film Poetry in Wartime, and also to provide a place for publishing =
art work in response to war, including poetry, essays, stories, blogs, =
and images.=20

Craig:

One cannot read Rilke without feeling that he was in-love (with a muse). But
when it came to relationship with women, it seems that he was neurotic. Love
happens, or doesn't happen, while relationship must be worked on. Because of
this, I've always felt relationship more valuable, both personally and in my
work. Although I wouldn't want to have lived without having been in-love.

VPD score 3 in-custody deaths in 3 months!

    Although a pathology test HASN'T been completed, Spokesperson Sarah

Man shot with Taser dies in custody

VANCOUVER - Vancouver Police have released details about a man who died
in their custody a month ago - after he was shot with a Taser gun.

Robert Bagnall, 54, died June 23 after police were called to his hotel
on Granville Street.

Bagnall had locked himself in the bathroom of his hotel when police were
called to the scene.

They say he was combative, screaming and destroying hotel property.

An officer from the Emergency Response Team used his Taser gun to subdue
Bagnall.

While he was being handcuffed, Bagnall stopped breathing and died on the
scene.

Police Chief Jamie Graham insists using the Taser was the right thing to
do.

"I would remind you that there has never been a coroner in Canada or the
United States that has listed the Taser as the cause of death. In fact,
in Vancouver we now use the Taser specifically because a coroner's jury
recommended we deploy it to save lives."

Now, Police are looking elsewhere for an explanation of Bagnall's death.

Although a pathology test hasn't been completed, Spokesperson Sarah
Bloor says there were lethal amounts of cocaine in Bagnall's system.

She says police waited for those test results before telling the public
about the incident.

"We wanted the opportunity to get all the results back so that we could
allow all the information to go out to you in its full capacity - so
that you would know the lethal levels that existed, as well as what the
officers did that night."

Still, questions remain about the weapons.

Amnesty International wants them to be banned and the Canada Safety
Council says their safety should be reviewed.

Man falls to death following scuffle with police

An unidentified man fell to his death from the Knight Street Bridge on
Sunday following a police chase. Vancouver Police tried to pull a man
and woman over because their car didn't have licence plates.

But the driver sped off against oncoming traffic, sideswiping oncoming
vehicles, finally coming to a halt after hitting another car. The chase
then continued on foot. Police says an officer grabbed the man as he was
trying to jump off the bridge and tried to pull him back to safety, but
lost his grip.

The man fell eight metres to the pavement below.

The woman passenger who fled with the victim was taken into custody and
later released.

Police spokesperson, Const. Sarah Bloor says the man was known to police.

The Richmond RCMP is investigating the incident, which is considered an
in-custody death.

Roman Andreichikov: Dead in Custody

http://www.thetyee.ca/News/current/Dead+in+Custody.htm

(Roman Andreichikov died May 3, 2004, after Vancouver cops shot him with
a taser)

"I can't breathe."

Those, says a friend who watched in horror, were Roman Andreichikov's
last words as he lay pinned to the floor of his Granville Street
apartment. Three Vancouver police officers had piled themselves atop his
body while another one stood by his side. One officer pushed
Andreichikov's head down against the floor. Two officers bent
Andreichikov's legs at the knees while they used their body weight to
drive his ankles into his back.

"If you're mumbling, you're still breathing," was one officer's reply,
reportedly.

Moments earlier, one of the officers holding Andreichikov's legs had
shot him with a Taser - an electric stun gun that overwhelmed his
nervous system with 50,000 volts of electricity. With his body in
convulsions, the officers took hold of Andreichikov and bound his hands
with cuffs. Then thirty seconds after Andreichikov gasped his final
words, he drew his last breath...

Cowboys and Indians: Perspectives on

...a permanent...colonization, native reservations are benign forms of
apartheid. Natives as a race have been systemically brainwashed through
the use of reservations to be dependent on the State for its daily
existence. If a race is more concerned about its daily subsistence, it
is no longer concerned about righting the injustices of the past. It is
no longer concerned about reclaiming its lands through political, legal,
or, if necessary, military force. If a race is separated from the
mainstream systems of power and knowledge, it is not able to right the
injustices of the past through political, legal or military intervention.

Cowboys and Indians: Perspectives on

Patterns of U.S. and Israeli Colonization

Alden C. Mayfield*

The pattern of demonizing, conquering, colonizing, occupying and
plundering another nation is still a sad reality in our post-modern age.
Colonization is conveniently disguised in the noble rhetoric of United
Nations legality, democratic jargon, and liberationist rhetoric. The
history of the expansion of the U.S. is a clear example of this pattern
of colonization. Israel as a strategic U.S. partner is also another
example of this post-modern process of conquering, colonizing, and
civilizing the uncivilized. While many experts argue that the present
motives of the U.S. war in Iraq are meant to grant freedom to the Iraqi
people, others argue that the U.S. is simply pursuing its agenda of
global domination. This agenda of world domination is quite similar to
the U.S.'s goal of its westward expansion as it demonized, conquered and
colonized aboriginal lands in the present U.S. territories.

As such the U.S. government in the guise of democracy and human freedom
continues this pattern of demonizing, conquering, colonizing and forcing
its enemies into economic and political submission with military threat
in order to fulfill its own national interests. After all this is done
in the noble cause of conquering and civilizing the "native savages,"
the U.S. government enriches itself on their natural resources.

 From the beginning of the American colonies to the present era, the
U.S. agenda has always been dedicated to territorial expansion in order
to control natural resources. The colonization of "native savages" is an
obvious example of this imperialistic agenda. Modest estimations put the
systematic slaughter of native aboriginals in the U.S. anywhere between
20 million to 30 million people. From the 1600s to the present time, the
U.S. government has been systemically demonizing, conquering and
colonizing American aboriginals and other indigenous peoples in order to
dehumanize them into being pathetic individuals who are dependent on the
State as they are placed on segregated lands with third-world living
conditions.

As a permanent form of colonization, native reservations are benign
forms of apartheid. Natives as a race have been systemically brainwashed
through the use of reservations to be dependent on the State for its
daily existence. If a race is more concerned about its daily
subsistence, it is no longer concerned about righting the injustices of
the past. It is no longer concerned about reclaiming its lands through
political, legal, or, if necessary, military force. If a race is
separated from the mainstream systems of power and knowledge, it is not
able to right the injustices of the past through political, legal or
military intervention.

In other words, reservations have systematically emasculated and
dehumanized the aboriginal race in order to eradicate any future notions
of nationalism, independence and Statehood. Reservations are essentially
long-term tools of colonization in order to make natives powerless in
reclaiming their lands for independent Statehood. As such, aboriginals
on reservations are essentially powerless to reclaim their lands through
legal or political institutions. These governments have succeeded in
systematically eliminating the notion of natives reclaiming their lands
through political, legal, or military force. Such native notions of
nationalism, land reclamation, justice and political independence has
been deliberately erased with the colonizer's marginalized vision of
reservation existence.

With this illegal existence of apartheid-reservations, all treaties
signed between native tribes and Western governments are illegal and
non-binding pieces of paper as they were created in times of illegal
occupation. In other words, Canadian, American and Australian
governments are still illegally occupying and enriching themselves on
aboriginal lands.

Such a pattern of demonizing, conquering, colonizing and illegally
occupying Indian lands in order to civilize any Statehood ambitions and
to control their natural resources has been applied to various places in
the U.S. territories. The systematic colonization of Mexican, Hawaiian
and Filipino territories is another clear example of the present
relevance of American colonization. What are now Texas, New Mexico and
California were once Mexican territories. The U.S. simply annexed these
lands by demonizing, conquering, colonizing and permanently occupying
these lands. In the process millions of Mexican aboriginals were
systematically slaughtered in order to fulfill the U.S. policy of
westward expansion and colonization in order to control their natural
resources.

Similarly, Hawaiians were demonized, conquered, colonized and
subsequently occupied in order to control their natural resources and
Hawaii's geo-strategic importance for military purposes. The same
process occurred in the Philippine islands. Hundreds of thousands of
Filipinos were slaughtered in order for the U.S. to continue its
westward expansion of colonization. It could be argued that military
bases in Germany, Italy, South Korea, Japan, the United Kingdom and
other parts of the world are benign forms of U.S. colonization. The
simple fact that U.S. troops are based in foreign lands is indicative of
the fact that the U.S. government not only has influence on the
political and economic aspects of those lands, but it has the added
advantage of containing its enemies in other lands.

Some would argue that native reservations are benevolent acts of Western
governments. Indeed, the U.S. government could have exterminated all
natives in order to control all their lands. Let's not forget that acts
of aboriginal genocide have been committed in Canada, Australia and the
U.S. Some would argue that aboriginals are satisfied with their
reservation existence and are better off under the wise protection of
their conquerors. This is another racist argument of ethnic cleansing
that is also used by the Israeli government. If natives are satisfied
with living conditions that are below that of third-world living
conditions, that is a very sad existence with no future hope for their
children. However, if natives understand that political independence and
Statehood means first-world living conditions, they'll find more hope
for their children. The present reservation systems in Canada, the U.S.
and Australia deny aboriginals of billions and billions of dollars in
land revenues.

Like dogs living in a household, natives are literally given scraps from
the tables of their conquering masters. A few hundred thousand dollars
are given to the natives in order to make them a dependent race with no
future ambitions of independent Statehood. From the perspective of the
master, it would be unthinkable for a dog to rise up and reclaim its
lands and dignity in the form of Statehood. The pet dog has been
conditioned to be content with his doghouse, meagre scraps, and its
master's rules. It would be an understatement to say that dogs are
treated more humanely than aboriginals in their
doghouse-reservation-like existence.

As such, it shouldn't be surprising that this American pattern of
colonization is being systematically and deliberately applied to the
Palestinian occupied lands and Iraq. Despite American and British
attempts to paint this conflict with Iraq in humanitarian-liberation
jargon, this present day conflict in Iraq is not about Weapons of Mass
Destruction, Freedom, Democracy or Human Rights. It is about
colonization and occupation in order to control Iraqi oil fields. If the
U.S. can control Iraq's oil fields, it can essentially control the world
by strengthening the supremacy of its economy and military and thus
destroying the OPEC cartel as it is now considering changing from the
U.S. dollar standard to the Euro. If this war was really about true
freedom, democracy and human rights, the U.S. and the UK would have gone
to war with most Middle Eastern nations, including Israel, which is just
as bad if not worse than Iraq.

In following its traditional policy of demonizing its enemies (Saddam)
through the media and unsuccessfully through the UN, the U.S. is now
using military force to conquer, colonize and occupy Iraq in order to
control its vast oil reserves and thus control the world. This pattern
of colonization is a strategic part of U.S. foreign policy dating back
to the 1600s. The only difference is that the U.S. now employs phony UN
diplomacy and liberationist rhetoric to cover-up its real motives of
colonization and global domination. It is now clear that U.S. policy in
Iraq and the Middle East has always been regime change in order to
control oil and the world.

Unfortunately, the terrorist regime in Israel is an exception as it is
protected by the U.S. We've entered into another era of American world
colonization through political, economic and military force. This is a
clear warning to any nation (except Israel) that dares to disagree with
America's post-modern methods of colonization in order to control the
world and enrich its own national interests.

If the U.S. is really interested in freedom, democracy and human rights
in the Middle East, it would treat both Iraq and Israel with the same
standards. As far as I know, 30 years have passed since UN Security
Council resolution 242 was passed ordering Israeli troops to completely
withdraw from Palestinian occupied territories, but I don't remember the
U.S. giving the terrorist State of Israel a 48-hour ultimatum. The State
of Israel continues to mock the world and the UN as it continues to defy
and dismiss close to 400 UN Security Council resolutions ordering it to
withdraw from Palestinian occupied territories.

Iraq has defied a few UN Security Council resolutions over the past 12
years, but all of a sudden the U.S. government (the same government that
supplied the materials and technological know-how necessary to create
weapons of mass destruction, the same government that turned a blind eye
to Kurds and others being gassed by Saddam) is pleading intentional
ignorance and mocking the world with lies of freedom and democracy for
the Iraqi people as it wages an illegal war in Iraq.

A few hours after stepping down from Blair's government, Robin Cook said
that he quit because of "the West's double standard in dealing with Iraq
and Israel regarding their violations of UN Security Council
resolutions...30 years have passed since UN Security Council resolution
242 asked Israel to withdraw from the Palestinian occupied lands, but it
doesn't seem that we are losing our patience over Israel ignoring the
resolution," added Cook. The only thing the Iraqi people will get from
the U.S. is a post-modern form of colonization in which the occupying
power will control its natural resources and thus its future. That's the
goal of the U.S. government. Don't be fooled by its hollow language of
liberation. Don't believe George Bush when he says he "has no ambitions
in Iraq."

This American pattern of colonization and occupation has been
systematically and ruthlessly implemented by the Israeli State. From the
origins of the Israeli State in 1948, Western governments demonized
Arabs as uncivilized terrorists who are unwilling to share their lands
with the Jewish people. After this phase of demonizing Arabs as
terrorists, Western powers under UN cover illegally justified this
arbitrary form of institutionalized colonization as it partitioned
Palestine. In the next phase of this colonization, Western powers
trained, armed and organized Israeli militants who systematically
slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. At gunpoint, many
Palestinians were either forced to leave their lands or were killed.
With this phase done, the process of illegal UN and Israeli colonization
is now complete. The next phase of colonization is forced assimilation
into apartheid-like reservations for Palestinians, but this phase of
colonization has not worked as smoothly as the Israeli State had
planned. Disobedient Palestinians are now demonized as terrorists who
don't want to share their illegally occupied lands with the Israeli
colonizers.

For the past 40 or so years, the Israeli government has been
unsuccessful in seeking to put Palestinians in apartheid-like
reservations in order to erase their national aspirations of Statehood
and in order to control their natural resources. In fact, the Israeli
government's present policy of occupation and ethnic cleansing is a
clear indication that their project of putting Palestinians on
Western-style reservations has failed. Unlike the American and Canadian
projects of aboriginal reservation existence in order to eradicate
foolish notions of aboriginal independence and Statehood, the
Palestinians have successfully resisted this hopeless reservation life
under Israeli occupation. In short, Israeli policy is quite similar to
Western policies of dehumanizing aboriginals on reservations in order to
brainwash them into a dependent relationship: a master-servant existence.

With this American-Israeli model of colonization and occupation of
Palestinian lands, it is now easier to understand why the U.S.
government gives unqualified financial, military, and diplomatic support
to Israel's illegal and brutal occupation of Palestinian lands even
though Israeli policies are against international law. If Israel, as
Chomsky has cogently argued, is a strategic partner of the U.S. in the
Middle East, the U.S. government will simply view illegal Israeli
policies as necessary in order to dehumanize and control an indigenous
race that needs to be civilized like "savage American Indians." The U.S.
and Israeli States are afraid of aboriginal nationalism and democracy,
as this would mean independent Statehood and the loss of billions of
dollars in land revenues.

The U.S. has a sad record of conquering and colonizing other aboriginal
races. Since the U.S. government has been illegally conquering and
colonizing aboriginal lands, it doesn't see any need to treat Iraq and
Israel with the same standards under international law. Iraqis like
Palestinians are uncivilized "savages" that need to be conquered and
civilized. Israelis like Americans are the enlightened race that needs
to enlighten the unenlightened aboriginals. As savages, Iraqis need to
be civilized by American occupation in order to fully develop their oil
fields.

As a pioneer of colonization, the U.S. views Palestinians and Iraqis as
"savage Indians" who are messing up their plans of colonization and
world domination. The U.S. can easily control its Israeli client as it
is really an extension of the U.S. military and the U.S.'s political and
economic agenda in the Middle East. Iraqis and Palestinians are the
modern-day "Indians" that need to be conquered, colonized, civilized and
dehumanized on reservations in order to control their natural resources
and to erase all foolish notions of Statehood. Since Israel as an
extension of the U.S. military is allowed to possess weapons of mass
destruction as a superior race, any race--especially indigenous
(inferior) races--that foolishly dreams of Statehood is systematically,
politically and economically marginalized by the organs of knowledge and
power. The very fact that the U.S. government supports a
pseudo-democracy like Israel and a war criminal like Ariel Sharon is
indicative of America's concern for justice in the Middle East.

If these methods of post-modern colonization don't work, the U.S. and
Israeli governments simply resort to illegally confiscating lands,
bulldozing homes, uprooting farmlands and families, assassinating
political opponents with state-of-the-art military technology, shooting
missiles into crowded residential areas in order to kill civilians,
torturing political opponents without due legal and humanitarian
processes, carpet bombing or sanctioning any disobedient nation, and
excusing the killing of innocent babies, children, women and others as
collateral damage, or as necessary in order to civilize the race and
bend it to its national interests which is seen as world security and
peace. But, if those being occupied dare to resist such injustice, they
are systematically demonized as terrorists by the colonizers and their
media organizations. "Let's civilize the crazy Indian by burning down
his teepees, controlling his lands, exterminating his buffaloes, raping
his women and killing his children," remarks the brave American cowboy.

The pattern of American-style post-modern colonization continues its
terrorist cycle in terms of freedom, democracy, and globalization.

Familiar nest in coddle moss inhale the round of comfort
in the folds of your soft neck. Birth is the relief
of a lapsed Calliope: mother muse bears silence marking song.

Breath traduced to warmth is how you must first brush the vellum of why.

You must into the pores go, impossibly,
dampen the stormy lea and the vaulting skyward gray.
This is the profound of hope.
You are a small unseen and yet momentous pivot passing into
this.  To make way I make a place.
So what must I forget?  Forget the decay of batteries
and the cracks of plaster for they remember only themselves
pouring into twice-spilled bottles
and out of the anger of anticipations
all ultimately augured.  In making space.
And so what I have for you in this brief opening

are words, warm hollow: words: expect nothing.
Embrace everything, demand the impossible
and pause only to remember your direction:

from where, to where, for to remember is to inhabit,
to live within.  Make space.
Grow, then, upon escapes into, brief welcomes into
our cloud-hewn granite: what I share with you is hard as Himalaya
and familiar as home: Our fleeting trust is borne of earth.
I ask of you to ask of hope itself, for we must depart as we arrive:
to bury my body when it flags when it is near or within
and unboxed turn me roll me drop me into warmth of sodden mother peat.
Love me as I love you through this passing,
whoever or whatever we are.  And love, love, damn it,
pass into love, forge a music both reckless and gentle,
and sing its song, part sound and part silence.

If someone reads a love poem, and the way it's worded, the tone of voice,
or the persona, tend to remind the reader of the way someone who broke their
heart talked(through dissembling, etc. etc...) or acted,

then it's going to be much harder to appreciate the love poem, or the kind
of love poem,

that's what seems to me to be the core of this particular debate
which probably tells us less about rilke than about the person making the
comment

for whatever that's worth)

Jim Behrle has asked me to post the following reply to Tim Peterson's post
last night (at the bottom of this email):

Don't be deceived: Tim Peterson was never invited to
read at this event, which informs his late night post.
 My hope was to let people on this list know about the
event in the hopes they might attend it and listen to
the poets.  I do hope to see some of you in the
audience next weekend in Boston.

wow!
english; punctuation, metrical structure, a message (although a bit =
didactic and a tad corney) none the less, a poem from Alan Sondheim that =
doesn't leave me totally wanting an explanation.  I can read this one =
and say, "Oh, I see."  Not necessarily, "I agree." =20

But I'm more than willing ot make the trade...three Alan Sondheims for =
two broken baseballl bats and a rookie pitcher for next season.

ok I feel better about the snacks, here in Chicago we serve lots of raw meat
the bloodier the better especially pork this adds to the Hog Butcher flavor
we like, and we schedule our readings as not to conflict with Professional
Sporting events since the only true culture in Chicago are our baseball
teams and we would not want our poets to miss a game......

i've recently been reading much on this subject.

it's excruciating information to actually, really, read.
the thing is, we all hear about what was done (continues
to be done), but it's always vague details, punctuated with
Little House on the Prairie kind of resolve.

it's all highways now, and shopping malls, but...

without full exposure to our gruesome past, we
can, will, and DO continue to go after the last villages
out there, get them to stop making thread on their own,
stop growing food on their own, get them into our brand
new factories, get them working for U.S. factories, and
spending that (very hard) earned money.

there's a remarkable book called PRETTY SHIELD
it's a book-length interview conducted by Frank B. Linderman.
he came to the united states in the early 20th century, and
his goal was to interview Native Americans who were alive
before whites were seen, during, after.

Pretty Shield was a Crow medicine woman, and her story
is one of the most interesting i've ever read.

one thing Pretty Shield said which will always stay with me,
is that when the church arrived, her people learned to complain.
their coping mechanisms were broken, and, as she says,
"her people became as soft as mud."  she hated the church.
she saw how the tribute to the martyr was weakening an
already weakened spirit of a people.  she didn't want them
to surrender, but of course, it's what happened anyway.

Capture

I keep repeating the same figuration over and over again. It's virtual. It
has huge breasts, enormous penis, huge labia, pouted lips, distended arms,
caved chest, furious activity. it wants to fuck, it wants to die.

I'm looking. You're moving rapidly. I've never seen anything like it. A
furious rapidity. You can't hold still. I can't grasp you. When I try,
when I hold an image, it means nothing. It just goes like that. Furious.

Would you love me more if you had to pay?

The impetus of the program pays. The image is prostituted; I prostitute
myself before it. It's simultaneous contract. It's double penetration,
like the double-coding of language itself. It's not fucking, though. It
can't be grasped.

It isn't sex. It's isn't anything. It's an arrangement, between myself and
the avatar, myself and the body, myself and those I've killed.

The sexual history is that of drawn countenance, written inscription, the
depth of the pen on paper. It's the stain or residue of the same. It's
nothing more, nothing less.

There are no reasons beyond the electronic. We forget the silicon just
beneath the surface, the waveforms carrying the light of immolation to our
eyes.

Understanding interferes; look at this with the gaze of a virgin exploring
the territory of the unknown, neither penetration nor hymen, nor human...

It's already about exposure, how could it be anything else? The history of
the symbol...

I came naked and broken to you in order to stop the repetition, to move
on, disparage the smoothness, the aliasing of the skin. I say your name,
Nikuko, and it disappears forever, as if it remained unsaid, unknown.

Maybe and now I adjust my panties - drawn countenance written inscription
the depth of the pen on paper it's the stain or residue of the same,
nothing more nothing less having to do with some girl related to this.

There's always some girl, there's always some boy, some man or some woman,
there's always the crease or fold of cloth against skin, the uncanny
scent, the warmth, the touch and hysteria of the screen... the image
wanders...

Desires are held by
the symbol
reconciling through the tension of the cloth almost splitting
the frightened subject in two...

Fear is its benefit, electron and light, its generation. Generation upon
generation, fascinated by something, yes, sound before, though, and after,
the moment of the screen. It could be anything, this symbolic history, it
could be anything else. What would it matter? The passage of time...

Could be this is some girl the reason for the boys you hang around with?
It's some girl What makes you believe it's some girl? It's furious Are you
sure that you were afraid of something? It's something I hang around with,
it's fearful and your exhibition, Nikuko, it's your dream, your fuck, your
violence, your overturning, your ecstatic trance, your tremor, your doll,
your scent

It's your scent, Nikuko, your scent, your doll, it's your fucking the most
intense in the world, the furious image, it won't stand still, I can't
grasp it, nothing at all, it's

Do you really think that?

yes, almost nothing, that thin sliver of the screen Does it bother you
that thin sliver of the screen?

winding sheet, winding down Does this arouse you?

Does this arouse you?

Why Nepal Police is assaulting/torturing Sexual

I am writing this mail to inform you about the brutal assault and rape=20=

against 4 Metis (cross dressing males) by Nepal Police in Kathmandu,=20
Nepal, on the
early morning of 25th July 2004.

Jaya Bahadur Lama (Hetauda City), 28, Ramesh Lama (Hetauda City), 20,=20
Binod (Butwal city), 22 and Madan (Melamchi), 17 living in Kathmandu,=20
all of them are
surviving by selling sex. They were walking at 3.30 am in the evening=20
near Jamal, central Kathmandu. After a while a guy harassed the Metis=20
after they refuse to go
with him for sex. So the guy started abusing them verbally and Metis=20
also started shouting at him. At that moment, night patrolling police=20
van (blue coloured vehicle, No: 2348) arrived. The police started=20
forcing the Metins to get into the police van after the police=20
recognised them as Metis. There were 5 policemen under the influence of=20=

alcohol and 3 street guys already in the police van.

this is also what happens to small towns in relation to big towns &
corporate life -- and i think this is a violation, an injustice, as well.

i don't mean by this comparison to belittle the other hardships and spectrum
of experiences of the native american peoples, the deaths in holocaust-like
proportions, but this sort of "assimilation" seems to be just what america
"does" with everyone -- third world countries and small towns alike --
assimilate them, suck out their business, globalize etc etc etc.

it's sad.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

This is a selection from my current work in progress (right now it is a
short chapbook), I am not sure if it is over yet. The title is simple... it
was taken from a psalm before I knew the psalm but now I see how it was in
the intent. Maybe it was simply it was the collision of two intents... and
the line of the song of Isreal is "I will wake at Midnight and praise you."

1 Thousand has many signifigances, but for me it is simple. The 1 Thousand
Leaf Lotus,
quite literrally if you know what I mean (wink with a mischevious grin).



when one is centered in God the life
all actions flow out from that one
                     as if at the center of each.

            The part whose voice talks life is life
& each movement is purified
I have begun to understand in the solitude of my heart
         but brother
         but sister
help me to understand it now
with you moving at this moment
Tell me all the beautiful names you have heard
         but tell me the name that is yours
maybe the name your parents told you
maybe not
          maybe half in jest
         maybe polluted
but talk to me that name
that unification of life
& shout it
& make it into a song
& then hear mine             (Abba, Abba, Abba)
& remind me how it talks in me.

           ps. If anyone should see me in the streets, ask me the song.

...
and some say that God is murder
yes... God is murder of the self
the inner Jihad
        in the absence of which
the act is manifest
gathers in military formations of it

Yes my friend... God is murder.

And let the death in me
die every time.

just enjoying r. smullyan's _what's the name of this book?_ with variants
of the liar paradox and self-referenced strange loops, so i'll comment this.
if it's a statement it's also 'not a statement' so it doesn't make sense and
we could add or infer anything to or from it, like 'this is a dog, not a
statement' because the consistence is lost, and logic, at least classical,
doesn't operate with degrees of absurdity, once the logic is broken it's lost,
like a chain, and it becomes picture or spectacle or whatever, a collage of
some sort, like tv, without consequence (the logical stuff). so i'm wondering
what kind of picture this is, is it a false picture? there's another picture,
like data, sense data, prior to being processed as language as an instruction
(to operate on picture/data), which is true of this post and what comes in
through the eye, or in any sense, as a neural 'picture', the patterns
constituting that mental state. as a statement 'this is a picture' it seems a
representation of that, a redundant homunculus, and which get falsified by not
being a statement but a picture. something like that, anyway, the
picture/statement dichotomy is nice, and its paradoxes, picture-as-statement
and vice versa, in a way it's only active/passive matters, which again are
only roles within the layers of self-reference - the statement is a picture
(structure have matter), and the picture is a statement (matter is
structured). maybe something to do with an exploding dynamic, time, things are
exploding and as fast as they can, like trees explode slow, matter turns into
structure, chaos into order, given an open system and some flux through it,
and paradoxes keeping it out of equilibrium. if nature's matter is one, not
dual, we'll have layers of self-reference interaction, the problems are with
the dualisms, where the interaction turns into an infinite regress and don't
ever get started. if pictures and statements were different matters we'd have
none, now, we've got both, their violence turbulence which made us and in the
hands ofl, emerging order always screeching with the absurdity of matter.

For Immediate Release: Monday, July 25, 2004



Tent City Rises In Downtown Fredericton

Anti-poverty activists to present demands to provincial government



Fredericton activists erected a Tent City in Officers’ Square this morning in an effort to house the homeless while highlighting corruption in the provincial housing system. The housing action caps a two year ordeal endured by Bonnie O’Dea, a single working mother who is challenging New Brunswick’s housing system and justice system.



“This Tent City is our response to a situation involving racial harassment, discrimination against a single working mother, a retaliatory eviction, inactivity by police and the Rentalsman, judicial bias, obstruction of justice by the Law Society, and the provincial government’s oppressive Economic Unit Policy, which penalizes the poor for sharing accommodations,” said Vaughn Barnett, an organizer with the Advocacy Collective. “These circumstances have led to government-sponsored homelessness, and we are highlighting this fact with today’s gathering of the homeless, the poor, and their supporters in Tent City.”



While a tenant of Fredericton Non-Profit Housing Corporation, Ms. O’Dea and her family experienced ongoing abuse, including home-invasion and a death threat, from a neighbouring tenant. Despite pursuing justice through various channels, Ms. O’Dea received no assistance and was herself evicted following her complaints. Ms. O’Dea and her children are homeless due to the Economic Unit Policy, which prevented her from sharing an apartment with a supporter on social assistance without a reduction of income.



“I went to my landlord, the police, the Ombudsman’s office, the Rentalsman, Family and Community Services, my MLA, and the courts and I’ve been rejected by them all,” said Ms. O’Dea from her tent in Officers’ Square, adding that she has shared her story with various community organizations. “Tent City is a last resort to let the public know that my family and I will not stand for this mistreatment.”



Half a dozen tents sit in Officers’ Square as of 9am this morning. Similar tent cities and homeless squats are organized across the country, including Toronto, Vancouver, Kingston, Kitchener-Waterloo and Halifax.



The Advocacy Collective will present a list of six demands to the Premiere’s Office and other government officials.

Isn't this an age old argument?

 Can art be separated from politics?Can the work of Rilke or any other
artist be experienced at face value without letting his actual life or person
affect that experience.

 Like Leni Riefenstahl, like Coco Chanel, Shakepeare and Ezra Pound.  Is art
judged for what it is or do we add the creator's politics to the  quality and
meaning of the art?

 Is there an answer to this question, or does it remain a   theoretical
polemic ?

A truly great piece, Alan! It's both moving and disturbing in a strange way.

Would it perhaps be even more powerful if you had it end with the
loosely hanging "nothing at all, it's ...", thus emphasizing the
floating and escaping and non-graspable quality of it?

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and taverns!),
utilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented forms. We
will explore the structural possibilities of language to ultimately answer
the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning and practiced
poets will generate lots of original writing from this full day of language
play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye with which to
revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist who has performed and taught
extensively around the country. Her work has appeared in Paterson Literary
Review, Painted Bride Quarterly, Schuylkill Valley Journal of the Arts, Mad
Poets Review, and La Petite Zine. She also has a CD titled notspeak.

Perhaps, but then the body floats away as well. There's the slimmest of

Ric Carfagna has asked me to post this on his behalf.



Vernon



Hi All, Ric here -

I have been privileged to be in attendance at every 'official' Boston Poetry
Gathering since its origins back in 1999. I did miss the one held last year
though.

I have even had the good pleasure of reading one year, 2001, I think.



The history of the gathering is interesting. The first year it was held in
mid-summer in an un-airconditioned venue located in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. It was in a small room crammed with both poets, poet
aspirants and just lovers of poetry in general. The atmosphere was electric,
eclectic and just plain fun. There didn't seem to be an agenda, a poetic axe
to grind or anything which might be construed as underhanded or 'political'.

It was a powerful show of poetic potential (excuse the alliterative).



The year after that the venue shifted to Boston, where it has been held ever
since.

Aaron Kiely who was the mastermind behind the whole thing was, I think, one
of the greatest reasons for its success. He had the drive and ambition, as
well as the personality to keep the whole thing balanced and running like a
well-oiled machine. Not an easy task when dealing with, oh how shall I say
it, diverse temperamental poetic personalities.

In the ensuing years Aaron has taken a back seat in the planning and
carrying out of the event.

The name also has seen an evolution (?):

 It was originally, The Boston Poetry Conference, then The Boston Poetry
Marathon, now...

The Boston Poetry Massacre. What's next....maybe (in my opinion) The Boston
Poetry Obituary.



Why, you may inquire. Well alas, the passion has flagged. The once meaty
poetic event has now become a parochial parody of its once powerful self.
There is no 'one' to blame; it's just a matter of a watered down, poetic
back-scratching, I'm your friend-you're my friend kind of event.

Where are the days of the poetic diversity of a Charles Bernstein and
Rosemarie Waldrop on the same bill ?

Gone also are the poetic 'legends': Creeley, Wieners, (although I know
John's 'physically' not with us any longer).

Not to mention all the other 'poets of note' that have seemed to be fewer
and fewer in number as the years have progressed.



It seems to be all about an 'agenda' these days. That, and who you know, and
if they 'like' you, your poetry, and you 'fit in' with the clique.
Personally, I love poetry and it saddens me when I see it reduced to such a
meager vision and petty insular aspirations. I can only hope that the Boston
Poetry...Whatever it's called, will get back to its roots, digging deep and
brining back the full flower of poetry's potential. ( I wanted to end with
an alliterative).



                                                            Ciao,

                                                                  Ric

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

reborn Socratic mist
contradictory, enigmatical rein letter
ethical rhapsodist, do you deny
this could be one of my old-timey poems?
these lines, rose-leaf fog, seem
to come from some dark leaf of the sun
instead of from within my breast
here the underworld bares itself to my
poor judgment, two by two


even for a last chance to get in
out of the rain, the shrewdest pair
will not side with me, they've
left me, all, on this divide
it's not worth the bother,
the enthusiastic favor?
the burned child fears the stove?
goading them doesn't work either,
they've suddenly gone all noble

Jim Behrle has asked that i post this in response to Ric Carfagna's post (at
the bottom of this email).

--------

I don't remember Ric mentioning any of this to me when
he asked to be a part of this event.  The focus of
this weekend isn't on the older generation: this is a
chance for younger poets to gather and share work.

I don't know if I'm missing something here or not,
but nowhere in Tim's post do I infer that he's
implying he was asked to read; only that he can't
make it cuz he'll be out of town. Bears

Don't be deceived: Tim Peterson was never invited
to read at this event, which informs his late
night post.
 My hope was to let people on this list know about
the event in the hopes they might attend it and
listen to the poets.  I do hope to see some of you
in the audience next weekend in Boston.

I'm not sure exactly what agenda you're mentioning. And I don't mean that as
a smart-ass, I really don't know.

But I have to take issue with "Where are the days of the poetic diversity of
a Charles Bernstein and
Rosemarie Waldrop on the same bill ?"

Shafer Hall, Prageeta Sharma, Daniel Nester, hassen, David Kirshenbaum,
Marcella Durand, Shin Yu Pai, John Coletti, Shanna Compton- that's some
poetic diversity. Check them out.

This post is especially for those of you on the List who have Buffalo
poetry connections.  As you know, for a relatively small metropolitan
area, the poetry scene here is quite varied and certainly lively.  Until
very recently, local and visiting poets of all stripes -- those with
academic affiliations and those outside the academy -- mixed freely both
in local poetry venues and on the pages of Artvoice and The Buffalo News.
 Thus, we have perhaps enjoyed a luxury of opportunities not easily
available elsewhere -- especially the newspaper outlets.

This is what has happened since early June:  Due to funding limitations,
Just Buffalo Literary Center has cut back its featured readers at the
three Open Readings venues from two paid readers to one each month: 72
paid gigs now reduced to 36.  One of the venues has been moved with the
inevitable drop in attendance that any such move would involve.  We hope
that decrease is temporary.  Several poets active in the Open Reading
Series are working with staff to restore the necessary funding to bring
back the two readers at each venue.

Within a week or two of this news, Artvoice ceased publishing poetry on a
regular basis effective July 1.  The literary column will be used for
reviews and essays -- an editorial decision not based on finances
apparently, but a real loss to the poetry community nonetheless.

That left The Buffalo News with its 20-plus year-old once-a-month poetry
page.  This page contained poems by local and well-known visiting poets;
sometimes poets in both categories at once like Carl Dennis or Charles
Bernstein.  In addition to the poetry -- and payment for our published
poems -- the poetry editor, Bob Pohl for the last 17 years, wrote a
well-written, well-read and much-depended-upon column of commentary and
information about who was coming to town, who was reading and where, what
their work was all about, and how to get there.

About a week ago, we discovered that The Buffalo News is decimating its
Poetry Page, effective August 1 -- cutting the poetry space by 50%,
killing Bob Pohl's column, limiting the calendar of coming events.
Initially, this was rumor.  To date, there has been no public notice.
Our thought was to confirm the rumors (which we have done) and then to
respond before the announcement.

To those who have benefited from the poetry scene here:  We are asking
that you write to The Buffalo News Editor-in-Chief, Ms. Margaret Sullivan
 MMSullivan@buffnews.com to let her know of your interest in this matter.

Those of us who have written thus far have received a response back that


"We have no plans to drop the Poetry Page, but are expanding its mission
to
include literature as well as poetry. We will continue to publish the
works
of local poets as well as the calendar information."

In other words, Bob's invaluable _Literary_ column is gone -- and there
is no acknowledgment that the space devoted to poetry will be cut in half
-- beginning with the monthly page, August 1.

Your help, if you are so inclined, would be much appreciated.  If you
have questions, please feel free to backchannel me.

Thanks for your patience with the length of this post.

On the whole I am disappointed by this news, but don't really care. I live
in Buffalo and know Bob Phol and look forward to his articles. This is the
only piece of this I will miss. The Artvoice poetry section was getting
better since Mike Kelleher took over the post of placing poetry, but most
cases this, as well as the Buffalo News poetry section, published some of
the worst forms of poetry in our neighborhoods. The Buffalo News poetry was
generally a breeding ground of cultured bacteria and mosquitoes. I am not
surprised by this action by either paper. This is the environment we live
in, and poetry is not center stage. Even the Buffalo Arts Council will not
support poetry, so why should we ask the papers to carry it? It is the
responsiblity, now, it seems, to be the job of poets to promote their work
and work of their fellow poets.

Thanks for this list, and those like it!

Best, Geoffrey Gatza

Hi Karen,

I am sure that my words will offend every poet who was in that rag and
that's fine. Even with your yearly appearance it did not seem to convince
the editors of the Buffalo News to continue with the section. I am sorry
that your venue will no longer be available for you to publish your work. I
am sure you will find many other places for your poems. So I am sure this is
not the end of the great Karen Lewis. For me, I never bothered to become
engaged in their publishing cycle and for that matter never cared a fig if
they continue on or go under. Their support for American poetry is half
hearted, at best and insular and 'out of the know' the other half.

the world (for Miekal And)

the world is _precisely_ as it seems, although for centuries it has been
considered an illusion, or the imprint of the limited bandwidth of our
sensorium. in other words, it's seemed as if it were fictive, but now this
fictivity itself is in question. instead, wysiwyg - what you see is what
you get; this is true for the universe as well. there are no spirits,
hidden crevices, gods or goddesses, no souls, afterlives, heavens or
hells: there is precisely what one sees. we are embedded in it; we are
part and parcel of it; there is naught else. the world seems to be all
there is, and it is precisely that. it is describable, inert, mute, moot,
encompassing; we are of the world, which is not of us. for the world is
greater by far; we are among its accidents, its sports, its momentary
heuristics tending nowhere in particular. it is illusion that the world is
illusory; it is false that the world is false. there are no veils, no
secrets.

Vernon-

Please pass this on to Ric...


Ric -

I started a poetry festival this year in my town of Carrboro NC
(http://carrboropoetryfestival.org).  It was modeled on the Boston
Poetry Conference in 2000.  Aaron was the organizer of that event.  I
traveled to the event from North Carolina as a complete stranger to all
except in the slightest exceptions--the people whose acquaintances I had
made on the subsub & buffpo lists.  The highlights of the weekend were
for me at least the meals: having dinner with Gary Sullivan & Nada
Gordon, or a hilarious breakfast I enjoyed with Allen Bramhall, Beth
Garrison, and Stephen Ellis.  I couldn't have dreamed of finer company.

The readings of the Boston event in 2000 were hit or miss, but I left
there thinking that the errors were somehow a virtue.  One of the
event's strong point was its diversity of poetries & poetics, and
another was the simplicity of the design of the event, and another was
no doubt the singularity of Aaron's efforts.   He mixed it up and kept
it interesting.

I took the basic model of the Boston Conference and extended it a bit
for the purposes of the Carrboro event: I modified it to fit the
community, of which the Carrboro Poetry Festival was undoubtedly a part.
My responsibility was to the Town of Carrboro, but my agenda was poetry,
poetry that *I* liked.  (I never gave anyone an opportunity to suggest
readers to me.)  I wanted the community to reach to poetry that I
thought crossed lines, so I brought in many great local poets who often
are forced to ride in the backseat to the more mannered & esteemed local
poets.  Along with these local poets, I brought in a group of poets who
I thought represented some of the best poets, particularly younger
poets, America has to offer.

As an outsider, having never taken nor taught a single course in poetry,
I felt a necessity to have a range of tastes, proclivities, voices, and
influences in the festival, tastes fettered only by years of mania.  For
example, the least-published poet of the event was perhaps the
most-talked about, a friend of mine named Mack Ivey, who only started to
write in his 70s after beginning to show symptoms of Parkinson's.  He's
a member of a group of (mostly) seniors who have been meeting in Chapel
Hill to read poetry to each other every week for 30 years, a group with
whom I've enjoyed the privilege of reading.  People dug his work, not
out of the bleeding of identity politics, but because the guy is so damn
funny, such a good writer.   Surprises and collisions of different
tastes kept the audience fascinated with poetry.   I could not believe
that I had managed to land an amazing turnout (estimates on attendance
range from 500 to 800), all on a budget of $700.

But it was the enthusiasm of poets like Standard Schaefer, Murat
Nemet-Nejat, Chris Murray, and Kasey Mohammad...ahh it was a drug I wish
I could bottle.

As a result there are promises of funding and help.  I couldn't get
ANYONE to help me (with one exception) in organizing this festival.
After its success everyone it seems wants a piece.

So that's how such a conference goes downhill: everyone wants a piece,
and some of them get a piece.  And something very simple gets quite
complicated and no one ends up having much fun.

One reason I think I was able to get away with such a broad range of
poets for a festival is perhaps because I owe no one any favors in the
poetry world.  I don't need to find a job or land a grant or impress a
publisher.  And people who know me know I'm quite rude when it comes to
backslapping.  The poets who came from out of town were for the most
part (maybe one or two exceptions) virtual friends--people with whom I'd
developed good friendships via email, some of whom I had already met in
person (Murat, Linh Dinh), others with whom I had read (Lee Ann Brown,
hassen).   They were friends because I loved their writing and wanted to
correspond with them about things in my own head for which I could find
no purchase except in their work.  The poetry was the basis, the
genesis.

Perhaps the best feature of this festival was its place in the community
of Carrboro: the event was in the heart of downtown Carrboro, steps away
from a dozen restaurants, bars, and even a community-run co-op grocery
store that has a lawn instead of a parking lot.  My town is an amazing
town, and I was able to have all of these poets get together after the
readings and share meals.

There is a clique, or, rather, a group, actually, that has formed
locally & contemporaneously with the event.  I know I will feel some
pressure to include more of them in next year's festival, especially
considering some of them are now my friends, but I am resolute, and will
stick to my policy of inviting only those whose work impresses the paste
out of me, all while keeping the poetry tastes mixed-up, as in confusing
and surprising.  (There are quite a few of them in this group who are
very good writers, too many to include in the festival the same year.)
I can deal with resentments, with the sour grapes of someone who might
feel excluded & might need to display a need to exclude me at a later
date.  The way I see it: poetry is more important than you or me.  It
all comes down to (1) my opinion and we know how subjective an opinion
might be and (2) a limited number of readers.

I've been tempted to extend responsibilities to others and expand the
festival for next year, but I don't think I will do that.  I'll use the
money solely to pay poets & promote the event, and keep the readers to
my own nutty tastes, true to my own measure, for better or for worse.  I
won't expand the event, and I won't invite poets whose work I find
complacent.  With your note, Ric, I feel reassured I have and will
continue to do the right things.

It all comes down to eating together.

So come next year.

Hi All, Ric here -

I have been privileged to be in attendance at every 'official' Boston
Poetry Gathering since its origins back in 1999. I did miss the one held
last year though.

I have even had the good pleasure of reading one year, 2001, I think.



The history of the gathering is interesting. The first year it was held
in mid-summer in an un-airconditioned venue located in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. It was in a small room crammed with both poets, poet
aspirants and just lovers of poetry in general. The atmosphere was
electric, eclectic and just plain fun. There didn't seem to be an
agenda, a poetic axe to grind or anything which might be construed as
underhanded or 'political'.

It was a powerful show of poetic potential (excuse the alliterative).



The year after that the venue shifted to Boston, where it has been held
ever since.

Aaron Kiely who was the mastermind behind the whole thing was, I think,
one of the greatest reasons for its success. He had the drive and
ambition, as well as the personality to keep the whole thing balanced
and running like a well-oiled machine. Not an easy task when dealing
with, oh how shall I say it, diverse temperamental poetic personalities.

In the ensuing years Aaron has taken a back seat in the planning and
carrying out of the event.

The name also has seen an evolution (?):

 It was originally, The Boston Poetry Conference, then The Boston Poetry
Marathon, now...

The Boston Poetry Massacre. What's next....maybe (in my opinion) The
Boston Poetry Obituary.



Why, you may inquire. Well alas, the passion has flagged. The once meaty
poetic event has now become a parochial parody of its once powerful
self. There is no 'one' to blame; it's just a matter of a watered down,
poetic back-scratching, I'm your friend-you're my friend kind of event.

Where are the days of the poetic diversity of a Charles Bernstein and
Rosemarie Waldrop on the same bill ?

Gone also are the poetic 'legends': Creeley, Wieners, (although I know
John's 'physically' not with us any longer).

Not to mention all the other 'poets of note' that have seemed to be
fewer and fewer in number as the years have progressed.



It seems to be all about an 'agenda' these days. That, and who you know,
and if they 'like' you, your poetry, and you 'fit in' with the clique.
Personally, I love poetry and it saddens me when I see it reduced to
such a meager vision and petty insular aspirations. I can only hope that
the Boston Poetry...Whatever it's called, will get back to its roots,
digging deep and brining back the full flower of poetry's potential. ( I
wanted to end with an alliterative).

Convention Demonstration Zone is a Dark, Shadowy Place
by Mark Jewell

BOSTON - While thousands of delegates, journalists and dignitaries stream
into the FleetCenter, a shadowy, closed-off piece of urban streetscape
just over a block away will be the place protesters call home for the next
several days.

The maze of overhead netting, chain link fencing and razor wire couldn't
be further in comfort from the high-tech confines of the arena stage where
John Kerry is to accept the Democratic nomination for president.

Abandoned, elevated rail lines and green girders loom over most of the
official demonstration zone, sloping downward to a subway station that has
been closed for the convention that kicks off Monday.

At one end of the 28,000-square-foot zone, tall protesters will have to
duck to avoid hitting the girders. The train tracks obscure the line of
sight to much of the FleetCenter. Concrete blocks have been set into place
around streets that surround the site, a transportation hub on the north
side of downtown.

Protesters have compared the site to a concentration camp and complain it
is too far away from the FleetCenter to get their messages across. The
zone is next to a parking lot where many delegates will pass on foot on
their way to the downtown arena.

Authorities say _ and a judge has agreed _ that the discomforts are
necessary security requirements in the post-Sept. 11 era and as protests
at big events become increasingly violent and disruptive.

On a rainy morning made darker by the presence of the girders overhead,
protest leaders on Saturday held a news conference at the demonstration
zone to object to the site as pools of rainwater collected on the
pavement.

Some protesters taped their mouths shut while others spoke out in anger to
express opposition to protest restrictions they say violate free-speech
rights.

"We don't deserve to be put in a detention center, a concentration camp,"
said Medea Benjamin of San Francisco. "We feel it's tragic that here in
Boston, the birthplace of democracy, our First Amendment rights are being
trampled on."

Benjamin was joined by two other protesters from the anti-war group Code
Pink who dressed in pink Statue of Liberty garb. The two others kept their
mouths taped shut during the news conference, and Benjamin removed her
tape to speak with reporters.

Activists said they understand the need to maintain high security for the
convention. But they said organizers went too far in restricting
demonstrations.

"We are on high, high red alert for the protection of our civil
liberties," said Claryce Evans, national coordinator for United Peace and
Justice. "Yes, security is an issue, but you don't handle it by setting up
an internment camp."

On behalf of protesters, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union
and National Lawyers Guild asked a federal judge to open up or move the
zone.

This past week, U.S. District Judge Douglas P. Woodlock refused to order
changes, despite calling the conditions "an affront to free expression"
and a "festering boil." However, the judge did allow protesters to march
past the site on Sunday, the night before the four-day convention begins.

A coalition of protesters filed an appeal with the 1st U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals on Friday in hopes of winning an order easing the restrictions
at the demonstration zone.

The appeals court denied a motion for a preliminary injunction Friday, and
the panel asked that briefs be filed by Monday morning.

Authorities said that they were lowering the maximum number of protesters
allowed to 1,000 from a previous 4,000 because of concerns of
overcrowding.

Other protests are planned during the convention at sites farther away
from FleetCenter.

1998 was the debut of Aaron Kiely's "Boston Alternative Poetry Conference,"
not 1999.

As Kiely's was the only poetry conference around, the "alternative" angle
was dropped from the title in subsequent years. Either that or the
conference became more inclusive. Or what was alternative that summer was
all the rage next summer and the loss of its edge lead to the loss of
title. Or the title was simply too long to say and could not stay. Or it
lacked the irony and self-deprecation of later titles. The real reason may
lie somewhere in there.

By the second conference in 1999 the use of "alternative" was a picked bone
with the poets. The discussion played itself out here on the Poetics list.

Actually the entire history of the Event over the past six years can be
read in the Archives here: how it bounced around among Harvard Square,
Kenmore Square (near Fenway Park) where it stayed for a while, then a
classroom at MIT, and now back to Harvard Square. All the readers are
listed in schedules and announcements; it's quite a history. Ear-witness
reports from several attendees usually follow the event itself.

I also would like to contest the distinction between poets and "poet
aspirants." Tho anyone in the room that first summer could tell you that
general perspirants outnumbered all other comers ten to one. A "poet
aspirant" is just a poet who has not resolved to say, especially in front
of poets, "I am a poet" or "I am also a poet."

In any case the existence of these events has relied solely upon the
goodwill and energy of the organizers: Aaron Kiely and Sean Cole, Joseph
Lease and Donna DelaPierriere, Jim Behrle and others. There's no money
involved. Poets don't get paid* and pay their own expenses. Organizers
certainly don't make money. It's that cheap to do. Anybody with an interest
could certainly create their own similar venue and criticize by example
instead of airing petty grievances on a Listserv.

It doesn't take much integrity to put down someone else's work, in fact
it's very easy. To do the work yourself tho is another story, and one I am
suprised needs to be mentioned to poets. Anybody who can piss on Berhle's
work as a conference organizer should ask themselves why they are not doing
the work themselves. Until then I don't see why other folks should have to
suffer their whining.

I think it is so difficult to make programming
choices. Any combination of poets on a small bill (for
example I am now organizing a monthly reading series
in Beacon, NY which will probably feature two or three
readers a month) automatically starts to create a
feeling in peoples' heads about what the series is all
about.

(This was one reason why Jane Sprague's West End
series in Ithaca was so dynamic--because she refused
to "settle down" into an aesthetic groove).

But I imagine that putting together a large canvas as
Jim has done or as was done with the Philly Sound
reading is even crazier! It ranges from the carefully
curated (the way Patrick did it) to the nearly open
(the way Celia White does with Urban Epiphany in
Buffalo or the way Tom Natell used to do in Albany
with Readings Against the End of the World).

The more people you try to include the more people you
are leaving out, if you get what I mean.

The revolution isn't happening anywhere. There's no
revolution--it's a fabulous environment to be in
because the "Alternative" conference became the
"Poetry Massacre" and if that displeases someone in
Boston then there can be a *new* reading called the
"Alternative Massacre"! It's really cool that there
are enough of us writing and enough of us listening
that we can just do it how we want to do it and not
worry about losing anything.

It's also really great--really really great I
think--that these "city" events sometimes invite folks
from other places to come and participate: the way
Prageeta Sharma and I went to read at Philly Sound or
the way other out of towners are going to the Boston
reading. We are helping each other find community and
readership and companionship.

(Don't really know how best to address this to someone who's not on the list).

Ric,

Jesus, this is stupid.

Last year's 70 (or 60) at MIT was the only incarnation of the event I've been
to, but I saw a) no flagging of passion and b) plenty of diversity in poetic
styles, reading styles, backgrounds, etc. Almost everything I heard blew me
away. And this year the lineup looks equally promising (and no, I'm not on the
list).

It sounds like you're grumpy about this because there aren't any "big name"
poets. But these are big names in the making, Ric. Sean Cole, Jordan Davis,
Lori Lubeski, Anna Moschovakis, Stephanie Young... everyone in the lineup is
fantastic. & if putting Dan Nester, Chris Rizzo, Mark Lamoureux, Shin Yu Pai,
Stacy Syzmaszek, and Sara Veglahn in the same lineup doesn't strike you as
diverse, you probably don't know their work and should go look it up before you
write it off.

Personally, I love poetry and it saddens me when I see people writing off a
huge poetic event (& 74 poets!) just because it doesn't conform to their
expectations and experience.

By the way, this is at least the second year running that the festival's been
in Cambridge, not Boston proper.

Personally, I love poetry and it saddens me when I see it reduced to such a
meager vision and petty insular aspirations.

Dear Buffalo Poets (and the rest of you),

I would like to respond to a couple of issues raised in posts by Geoffrey,
Martha and Karen about the current climate for poetry in Buffalo.

First, I am saddened that the poetry page is being reduced in the Buffalo
News. Bob Pohl has been a dedicated editor with a great catholicity of taste
who has supported the publication of local poets for many years.  He should
be applauded for his efforts.  On the other hand, we might, for
perspective's sake, also do well to look around the country at how many
other metropolitan newspapers even reserve this REDUICED amount of space for
poetry.  Without looking, one can probably guess that the number is low,
which makes the fact that this page even exists in any form, much less that
it has done so for 17 years, extraordinary.

Second, I would like to temper the notion that the Buffalo poetry scene is
in crisis.  It seems to me to be alive and well, though, without a doubt,
certain changes are afoot. Editorial interests at the local papers,
including my own, are changing, which means that the kinds of publication
available to local writers are changing.  Funding situations are changing,
which means that the kinds of programming offered to the public by Just
Buffalo, are changing. In the university arena, the Gray and Capen chairs,
formerly occupied by messrs. Bernstein and Creeley respectively, are now
occupied by Steve McCaffrey and Susan Howe, respectively, and the curation
of the poetry/rare books collection, formerly carried out by Robert
Berthoff, is now in the hands of Michael Basinski.

Try to imagine another city with a population under 300,000, or even a city
of, say, a million people, wherein the poetry scene is lively enough and
large enough to accomadate -- nay, necessitate -- simultaneous change on
that scale. Difficult, no?

This has been a great *#%& in' city for poetry for half a century. And it
still is.

Lastly, I would like to address an issue Geoffrey brought up regarding the
responsibility of poets toward themselves, towards other poets, and towards
the scenes that breed them. While I think the tone of Geoffrey's remarks is
unnecessarily harsh, especially concerning the value of local venues for
poetry publishing, his point about poets promoting each other is well taken.
Institutions like Just Buffalo, the Bufalo News and Artvoice are only
that -- institutions. If one looks at the history of American poetry in the
20th century, one finds not a network of great insitution parting the Red
Seas of the poetry world for poets to wander into the promised land of fame
and glory, but a wide range of poetic practices occuring far below the radar
of meainstream institutions. Self-publishing, small press publishing, and
mimeography, as well reading series run in living rooms, art galleries, and
independent bookstores, not to mention the personal dedication, moxie and
chutzpah on the part of great poet/advocates like Pound or Ginsberg or
Bernstein or Spahr, have always been the lifeblood of the poetry scene.

An insitution does not a poetry scene make. Poets do. If our only hope as
poets, of whatever stripe, at whatever point in our careers as poets, is
publication in the Buffalo News, then surely we are lost.

Sincerely,

Mike Kelleher

My problem presupposed that I couldn't judge because I didn't know what the
facts were. All I had, or could have, was a series of different
perspectives, and so nothing that would count as an authoritative source on
which moral judgments could be based. But, as I have just shown, I did
judge, and that is because, as I now think, I did have some facts.

well, I fondly remember meeting and hanging with Patrick Herron at the
2000 reading, and other connections there made. people I knew by email,
or just by poems read, I knew by face. I guess it was then, after many
years of writing, that I fully made the resolve that Daniel mentions,
that I too am a poet. it was exciting. Patrick made his way to Boston
from NC, quite a show of gumption. I came from 14 miles northeast of the
city, but I don't know that I didn't have a longer journey. these mega
readings are important for the sense of life they offer. I'm not a
social guy but I appreciate the opportunity of such gatherings. and I
agree with both Patrick and Daniel about scenic complaints. one can
imagine the poetry scene (or any art scene) as a republic, if not a
hopeless totalitarian state, or one can take the responsibility of
democratizing by making one's own events. these several Boston events
are what they are, a lot of poets reading. I don't recognize one voice
in these readings, but plenary interest and refreshment. there sure as
hell should be more readings in Bosbridge-of-the-many-colleges, but the
lack of local readings certainly can't be laid upon Behrle. as a
caregiver, my time isn't exactly free, so I don't participate in the
scene as I would like, but it's still nice to know something's going on
around here.

In addition to the plague of viruses pretending to be from me and to me, today I
got a message pretending to be from my university, noting the large number of
"spam" emails "coming" from my address, concluding that I obviously have a
virus, and inviting me to open an attachment with instructions on how to deal
with this -- According to my McAffee virus detector, this message contains a
copy of the MyDoom virus -- My wife received a similar posting pretending to be
from her university --

If you get such a message, do not open any attachment till you've checked its

SEE THE VOICE

Announcing...

Visible Verse 2004 at Pacific Cinémathèque

Author and media poet, Heather Haley, is a well established presenter of
poetry video in Vancouver. An instigator of poetry video production and
appreciation in Canada, Haley and the Edgewise ElectroLit Centre convened
the original Vancouver Videopoem Festival in 1999. That festival became
critically regarded owing to the festival's progressive regard for spoken
word in cinema. The 2000 festival, for example, presented many poets both
in performance and on the big screen at the Pacific Cinémathèque. One of
their awards, the "Voice Award," honoured Best Performance in the hybrid
genre, and the audience could see for themselves the merits and
distinctions of poetry rendered in time in these two forms, stage versus
screen.

The Vancouver Videopoem Festival then built upon that critical base, with
widened explorations into poetry cinema across national frontiers. They
presented significant new works from Europe and the Americas, and continued
to offer Canadian audiences a remarkably broad selection of new videopoems
from our own country. And owing to Vancouver's strength in the film and
television production industries, Haley has been able to cultivate critical
interest between filmmakers and poets, with positive consequences for both.

While poetry video in Vancouver has been quiet lately, Heather is
definitely back in the hunt for new works. She will bring Visible Verse-a
new screening and performance poetry event-to the Pacific Cinémathèque in
early November, and is seeking:

    * Videopoems that run no longer than 15 minutes.
    * Either official language is acceptable, though if the video is in
French, an English-dubbed or-subtitled version is required for
consideration.
    * True literary merit. It is as vital in a videopoem as in traditional
media. The ideal videopoem is a wedding of word and image, the voice seen
as well as heard.
    * Please, no experimental films or documentaries.
    * Videopoem producers should provide a brief bio, full name, and
contact infomation in a cover letter. There is no official application form
nor entry fee.

    * The deadline is 1 September, 2004.

    * C.O.D. deliveries will not be accepted.
    * Send, at your own risk, videopoems and poetry films/preview copies
(which cannot be returned) in 1/2" VHS NTSC or DVD formats to:

      Heather Haley
      VISIBLE VERSE
      c/o Pacific Cinémathèque
      200--1131 Howe Street
      Vancouver, BC
      V6Z 2L7 Canada

    * Artists will be notified of acceptance by 1 October, 2004.

For more information, please contact curator Heather Haley, at
www.heatherhaley.com. Go to the "Events" section and scroll down to the

Barbed Wire Over Boston: Strong Police Presence at the Really, Really
Democratic Bazaar
by Naomi
Email: arche (nospam) riseup.net (unverified!)  28 Jul 2004

The green grass of the Boston Common, along with the civil liberties of
several thousand people were trampled today by squads of police that
continually marched, biked and cycled around and through the peaceful
displays of the Really, Really Democratic Bazaar.

But this useless show of force indicates just how frightening the world of
ideas and alternatives is to a corrupt system starving itself to death on
a diet of war and vanishing natural resources.

Under the propagandized shield of "combating terrorism" and "preventing
violence", the growing security state seeks to protect itself from the
exploding numbers of the disenfranchised that will inevitably rise against
it.

And on the Boston Common, approximately 2500 people of all flavors
celebrated "another world is possible" while ignoring the police. Live
music on two stages, free haircuts, free massages, free bikes, and free
hugs were just several of the ways people expressed their commitment to
the creation of community and the living protest to consumptive living.

Among the more compelling displays was a representation of the Israeli
apartheid wall and a car that gets 75mpg on vegetable oil. Radical
cheerleaders sang out exuberantly, and Seeds for Peace, Food Not Bombs and
the Frida Bus provided fed all those that were hungry.

But those that champion sustainable alternatives to the current system of
war and exploitation face an increasing level of harassment and
disruption. At one point during the bazaar a Coast Guard helicopter,
machine gun sticking out of the open hatch door, buzzed just several feet
overhead of the event attempting to drown out music and conversation.
Groups meeting to discuss protest plans were also harassed by circling
police helicopters.

State police in soft riot gear marched by, while bike cops continually cut
swathes through the bazaar itself. Local,state and federal undercover
agents stood out against the many black clad anarchists
(http://www.blackteasociety.org).

The history of Boston, its source as revolutionary hotbed, has clearly
been dismissed. The most striking example of this memory failure is the
prison pit known as the "free speech zone." Stuck under a highway overpass
with eight foot high steel fences covered with plastic mesh and topped by
black mesh and razor wire, the free speech zones are an affront to the
very idea of free speech.

On Monday, a group of about 40 people sponsored by the Save Our Civil
Liberties Campaign (http://www.saveourcivilliberties.org) performed a
powerful street theater action using black hoods and "Camp DNC" guards.
Drawing the comparison between the pit and similar facilities in Iraq and
Camp X-Ray Guantanomo Bay, Cuba, the event drew a large amount of media
and bystanders curious at the dramatic play unfolding.
(http://boston.indymedia.org/newswire/display/24450/index.php and
http://www.alternet.org/election04/19365/)

MSNBC called the creative action the "worst way" the Democrats could start
the week, and indeed no critique of the protest pit has been raised inside
the Fleet Center. Apparently the Democrats are so desperate for an
election victory, they're willing to drop the Constitution along the way.
This is just another way the Democratic Party has become little better
than the Republicans and neocons they are trying to replace.

Another disturbing trend for the Boston DNC security is the use of regular
Army personnel for domestic policing. Unlike Georgia where a "State of
Emergency" was declared, this time both national guard and regular
military personnel have been placed on the street and in the subways to
search and police peaceful citizens.

The use of regular military for domestic policing can only occur under an
executive order, this time signed and delivered in secret. It's taken four
years, but Bush Administration has finally gotten the Posse Comitatus Act
fully discarded without public disclosure or discussion.

Despite visible and creative resistance in Boston to the corporate
take-over of government policy, civil liberties continue to fall under
siege. Where this erosion will end remains to be seen but despite the
siege - those who resist continue to assemble and celebrate. The grass is
greener, and untrampled, on the other side.

Five Letters from Another Empire

                       I
The third bottle of wine is still half-full.
The wreckage of the day is shaped like my hair.
The universe is statements void of proposition.
My hands curve with the memory of Vicky's bum.

                        II
I am telling my son stories, deep in the never-ending.
There is a car in the grove, its blue is the colour
of white birds wanting to be in. A louse explores
my robes. This is a day of daying being.

                       III
Victoria's breasts felt round like apples.
The Emperor's office has revoked my pension.
God walked in then slammed the door behind him.
I am sitting on more stories for my son, my son.

                        IV
A sentence is sometimes the words of a judge or a line
or more. A statement is what is saying
not is. There is a fox at nights walks by the tramps.
The Seventh Legion has decamped for Wales.

                        V
Together for this moment I told her as the Bible
assembled in quotation on memory's edge;
as we did cleave the war chariots gathered,
silently, at the farside of hunched in dark night.


Best

Dave

In case you are out of the news-loop - as many have been saying - the
article below is pretty worrisome stuff. Especially when it's big Republican
Bush backers who make and control the "future" history of the machines and
the content of the votes the machines allegedly represent. (Paul Krugman
wrote a very good article in yesterday's NY Times about a California
election that had been manipulated).

Does anyone know of public initiatives to call for a moratorium on the use
of the machines in this year's Prez elections??

Florida officials: Some voting records wiped out


Wednesday, July 28, 2004 Posted: 7:53 AM EDT (1153 GMT)


MIAMI, Florida (AP) -- A computer crash erased detailed records from
Miami-Dade County's first widespread use of touchscreen voting machines,
raising again the specter of election troubles in Florida, where the new
technology was supposed to put an end to such problems.

The crashes occurred in May and November of 2003, erasing information from
the September 2002 gubernatorial primaries and other elections, elections
officials said Tuesday.

The malfunction was made public after the Miami-Dade Election Reform
Coalition, a citizen's group, requested all data from the 2002 gubernatorial
primary between Democratic candidates Janet Reno and Bill McBride.

In December, officials began backing up the data daily, to help avoid
similar data wipeouts in the future, said Seth Kaplan, spokesman for the
county's elections supervisor, Constance Kaplan.

The loss of data underscores problems with the touchscreen voting machines,
the citizen's group said. "This is a disaster waiting to happen," said Lida
Rodriguez-Taseff, chairwoman of the Miami-Dade Election Reform Coalition.
"Of course it's worrisome."

The group is concerned about the machines' effectiveness, following
revelations about other problems with the system. Last month, state
officials said the touchscreen systems used by 11 counties had a bug that
would make a manual recount impossible. Earlier this month, a newspaper
study indicated touchscreen machines did not perform as well as those that
scanned paper ballots.

Also Tuesday, election reform groups asked a judge to strike down a state
rule preventing counties that use the machines from conducting manual
recounts from them.

State election officers say manual recounts are not needed since the
machines tell each voter if they are skipping a race, known as an undervote,
and will not let them vote twice for the same race, known as an overvote.
The officials also maintain that the computer systems running the machines
can be trusted to count the votes accurately as they're cast, and give the
final numbers when needed.

But lawyers representing the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups
said the state should require a paper trail in case a physical recount is
needed, as it was in the 2000 presidential race in Florida.

"I have concern about votes that are cast but not recorded," said Howard
Simon, executive director for ACLU of Florida.

Election supervisors from some of the 15 counties using touchscreens had
asked the state if they would need to go through the laborious process of
printing screen images of each ballot during a recount.

The Division of Elections then ruled that state law only requires a recount
to determine voters' intent, and that it is impossible to question voter
intent with touchscreen ballots.

Florida counties without the touchscreen machines use optiscan technology,
in which computers read voters' pencil marks on paper ballots, and would be
able to do physical recounts in tight races.

Administrative Law Judge Susan B. Kirkland has 30 days to make her decision
after receiving the hearing transcript, which is due back in 10 working
days.

Florida's voting system has been under scrutiny since the 2000 debacle, when
it took five weeks of legal maneuvering and some recounting before
Republican George W. Bush was declared president.

I've been poet laureate of my town since July 2003 and have become part
of a larger community of poets in the process.  It's been nothing but
positive in my estimation.  That's especially amazing to me considering
I applied as a joke, wrote a poem "by design" for my entry.  Joke was on
me.  It quickly became anything but a joke, but in a good way.

Everyone has been quite supportive & kind--appreciative.  (The worst
event so far among poets was my "inauguration day" as laureate.  I was
at a party that afternoon standing next to someone talking about his
friend who was "wrongly" and "stupidly" not picked to be laureate.  I
didn't know whether to laugh or feel offended.)

I am nervous that I can't have everyone from this local scene read at
the next Carrboro Poetry Festival, but I believe that a fundamental part
of any festival should be aesthetic "outbreeding"--bringing in work from
other locales and aesthetics so as to keep the festival from having some
sort of center--and in the back of my mind I am confident that those in
the local scene here who aren't reading at next year's festival will
understand and appreciate this guiding ethic.  Sure, some poets may
complain somewhere or somehow, but it's shit that ultimately doesn't
smear.  Having this festival is like wearing a soft shouldered suit of
teflon.

Besides, I shouldn't give a fuck about sour grapes.  I shouldn't.  I
shouldn't!  And that's easy.  The rewards far outweigh the crud--the
reward for me was the pure thrill of having so many people in my town
talk about how great poetry is, so many poets loving poetry they
typically wouldn't read, and just hanging out with a bunch of great
poets & friends who are suddenly so damn enthusiastic about their place
in the world.

David's right.  It is so damn easy to do.  But then it can be a real
pain in the ass, too.  I spend two excruciating months dealing with my
town's bureaucracy over one small item--eventually the mayor and two
lawyers were involved--over the dumbest of things.  That was a
nightmare.  All better now with the success of the festival.

The Boston conference in 2000 was fantastic.  I don't know if I could
have pulled off my own festival had it not been for the experience of
attending that event.

Dream Politics: Randomness in Network ArtLewis LaCookhttp://www.lewislacook.com

INTRODUCTION: Stochastic Computing


Chaos comes before all principles of order & entropy, it's neither a god nor a maggot, its idiotic desires encompass & define every possible choreography, all meaningless aethers & phlogistons: its masks are crystallizations of its own facelessness, like clouds.

Everything in nature is perfectly real including consciousness, there's absolutely nothing to worry about. Not only have the chains of the Law been broken, they never existed; demons never guarded the stars, the Empire never got started, Eros never grew a beard.

No, listen, what happened was this: they lied to you, sold you ideas of good & evil, gave you distrust of your body & shame for your prophethood of chaos, invented words of disgust for your molecular love, mesmerized you with inattention, bored you with civilization & all its usurious emotions.

There is no becoming, no revolution, no struggle, no path; already you're the monarch of your own skin--your inviolable freedom waits to be completed only by the love of other monarchs: a politics of dream, urgent as the blueness of sky.

Hakim Bey, Chaos, The Temporary Autonomous Zone



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Computers have a difficult time with spontaneity. By themselves, they're as predictable as any fundamentalist. This is what makes computer programming possible, the assurance I have that the code I write will be executed exactly as I wrote it. If I write a conditional loop, my computer will make a decision based on the parameters I feed to it; it won't take into account the weather, nor its own emotional state, nor will it ever be hung over from ten too many Guinesses and perform the function haphazardly from behind the haze of a violent headache. Computers, it would seem are very clean machines, not subject to noise or entropy. What you code is what you get.

This, naturally, hasn't stopped humans from introducing randomness into the computer. Most high-level programming languages have a function to simulate random numbers; and, while said numbers are very often predictable, the results can sometimes seem just as authentically random as more adroit sources of randomness. "True random numbers, captured in the wild, are clearly superior to those bred in captivity by pseudo-random generators—or at least that’s what the theory of randomness implies." Brian Hayes writes in his essay "Randomness as a Resource" ."But (one researcher) has run the output of various hardware and software generators through a series of statistical tests. The best of the pseudo-random generators earned excellent grades, but three hardware devices flunked. In other words, the fakes look more convincingly random than the real thing."

Hayes is writing here of the two main methods of generating random numbers in modern computing: pseudo-random number generation, which is just what those rand() functions do, and the harnessing of external entropy sources, such as atmospheric noise or radioactive decay rates. Entropy is an index of the disorder or noise in a closed system; and, in physics, all systems are sliding inevitably toward disorder. Thus, linking certain parameters in your code to an external source of entropy is the most effective way of utilizing the ultimate disorder of the universe in your scripts. Pseudo-randomness, however, is essential for research purposes, where a sequence of random results must be repeated in order to provide a stable set for analysis.

One can wonder why there would be a human desire to introduce randomness into computing. Take, for instance, the World Wide Web; instant global communication there, and wouldn't our ultimate preference be to clear this communication channel of all noise? It turns out, however, that randomness is a vital concept in the development of web networks, and much of the electronic economy would not exist without it. Ever buy anything online? Fill out one of those snoopy forms asking for potentially sensitive data such as your social security number or credit card number? If so, you more than likely want your privileged information to be secure, protected; viewable only by those involved in the transaction, if even then. Encryption is how one secures data over the HTTP protocols the World Wide Web is based on. Encryption performs character substitution on the data, which can then be decrypted (read into human-readable language) via a key file or function! , which was at one point rand
 omly or
 pseudo-randomly generated. Encryption is a sign of trust between a web service and a consumer; and it depends heavily on randomness to ensure that bond.

To that end, providing sequences of dependably random integers has proven to be a crucial--and colorful--web service. The wildest example would be the Lavarand system, a random number generator developed at Silicon Graphics. Lavarand was a hybrid of the two methods of random number generation; it seeded pseudo-random functions with an external entropy source; in this case, data derived from the slow motion of blobs in Lava Lite lamps. Lavarand itself seems defunct; though trademarked by Silicon Graphics, the original project seems to have all but disappeared as a service, but Lavarnd (http://www.lavarnd.com/), a similar project derived from the methodology of the original project, continues. The Lavarnd API, downloadable in both C form and as a Perl library at the site, allows developers the freedom of replacing the original Lava Lite lamps with virtually any entropy so! urce; one feature is the ability to use simple web cams, such as the Logitech QuickCam.

A similar web service, random.org (http://random.org/), uses a radio tuned between stations to inject their data with true random flavor; Swiss Fourmilab offers HotBits (http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/), which reads radiation via a Geiger-Muller tube detector.


INTRODUCTION: King Dionysus
Writing about randomness recently on the rhizome.org list-serv, American artist Jeremy Zilar (http://silencematters.com/)doesn't believe in randomness per se. "It is the dialog that we have with the process of observing of ourselves. The observed self, or the object, performance, process being created is a clear reflection of ourselves, and when we are able to gain that distance, we become more aware of what is going on inside, we make changes,. and then we correct the reflection to mirror ourselves once again....Randomness does not occur. It is a controlled element that somehow figures in to the image that we have of ourselves. Even when things do happen by chance, we immediately incorporate that action into the image and judge it's relationship to the whole, and juxtapose the whole to ourselves. If it doesn't fit, we remove it."

The distance Zilar writes about here is analogous to the "disinterestedness" that nineteenth-century German philosopher Immanual Kant proposed as a integral element in the aesthetic experience. "...a judgment on the beautiful which is tinged with the slightest interest, is very partial and not a pure judgment of taste," Kant wrote in his Critique of Judgment. "One must not be in the least prepossessed in favour of the real existence of the thing, but must preserve complete indifference in this respect, in order to play the part of judge in matters of taste." In other words, if a painting is figurative, and of a sunset, concerning ourselves with the beauty of the sunset and not of the painting itself is a bad judgment call. The painting is not the sunset. The sunset is not the painting.

It's this idea that nudged art toward the nonfigurative. If the contemplation of an art object is a disinterested contemplation, i.e. if we are to consider the painting isolated from what the painting represents, then why produce mimetic art at all? Why not simply delve into a "pure" painting, completely divorced from representation? In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, this became a central theme in the narrative of artistic development: freeing the art object from representation, and breaking through to the realm of pure being. Art, once a way to represent the natural, now strove to create the natural; instead of painting a sunset, the artist wanted to paint an experience that had all the impact of the sunset, but was its own phenomenon. Or, as Remko Scha asserts: "Esthetically motivated art...faces a curious challenge: if it is created by humans, it will always be inferior to nature! In the course of the twentieth century, this challenge has b! een taken u
 p by
 many artists. Some of them have suggested that they are in fact natural forces, beyond the ken of ordinary humans. Others have tried to withdraw from their artworks, by developing objective art-generating processes which they initiate without controlling the final result."

Or, as Hakim Bey, perhaps the most eloquent proponent of randomness in art, has reassured us: "Everything in nature is perfectly real including consciousness..."


INTRODUCTION: The Bacchanates


"Noise – or random data, or interference – has long been an obsession of digital artists. That obsession reflects the Nietzschean idea of a creative tension between the Apollonian and Dionysian," maintains Peter Carty in his review of C6's (http://c6.org/)NEST, or Network Examination of Seredipitous Transfer. "First outlined in The Birth of Tragedy, the idea is that Dionysus represents fundamental primal energy, while Apollo stands for rationality, logic and structure. Noise is unbounded dissonance; it is Dionysian. Information which is structured and rendered directly meaningful by IT protocols is Apollonian."

NEST (http://c6.org/nest/)is a peer-to-peer client with a twist. Unlike Morpheus or Kazaa, NESTers have access to only one file; a single audio file, corrupted by each pass through each user's computer. Instead of using TCP, C6 uses the notoriously unreliable UDP (User Datagram)protocol to hand data off from one client to another. UDP is unreliable because it performs very little error-recovery on the data passed through it; the experience is, as C6 themselves put it, "...much like the children's game of ‘Chinese Whispers’, where each client is linked to their closest geographical neighbour. Passing a ‘virtual whisper’ around the internet, each link in the chain can create new versions with each imperfect cycle."

Network art like this is ripe with entropy. There's just no telling what will happen to that audio file as it passes from me to you; but chances are, noise will distort it until it's no longer familiar to us. It's not "interactive" in the way most web and browser-based art has been; there are no Flash rollover buttons, no net video; its meat is the network itself, a network designed to incorporate flaws into its very hide. C6 style themselves as "conceptual marketers" (perhaps in keeping with the vogue of artists appropriating and aping corporate behaviors, and also, as are all such gestures perhaps, tongue-in-cheek), but what they've done here is more conceptual than marketable (fortunately!). NEST is unstable-network-as-aesthetic-experience.

Since random.org uses a radio tuned between stations as their entropy source, I often wonder what it would be like if they tuned in to rand()%(http://www.r4nd.org/). This net radio station is a randomness-hound's wet dream: all of the audio is composed at random in realtime, every time you tune in. Named for the ANSI C rand function, the audio programming is a collage of art-coders, including Lia and Carvalhais, Muio.org, Karlheinz Stockhausen (adapted for prime randomness by Georg Hajdu), and Pix. rand()% was developed by Tom Betts and Joe Gilmore as a commission by Media Centre Network of Huddersfield, England.

Listening to rand()%, one might often believe that one's computer is crashing. As with much random and chance art, you either enjoy it or you don't. Helen Valery Jamieson, in a recent post to the Netbehaviour list, expressed frustration with the flaws in randomly-generated artwork. She confessed: "I am not a big fan of randomly generated art; the concept might be interesting but I get bored by it fairly quickly. On the other hand, random elements within a work can be really inspiring. and there's computer random & human random - audience interaction with a programme or with a computer-mediated performance. It's random to the extent that you don't know what the audience is going to come up with, but it's within certain parameters. structured randomness perhaps." As rand()%'s only interaction with the audience is the act of tuning in, those less appreciative of random art might find the station annoying. There is, however, much to love in the program s! tream: pops, gurgles, gr
 inds and
 static, peppered with actual notes in some cases, cascade through your PC's speakers when tuned to rand()%. When I was younger, I played in a lot of improvisational fusion bands, but after a few years found myself getting rotyally bored with the experience; it often seemed that all I was doing was going up and down scales in varying increments. rand()%'s artists seem to have solved that problem; but, while the works are composed anew with every listen, there can be an overwhelming sameness to the pieces, as if, in absence of hierarchical structuring, the works are so horizontal that they inspire no emotional interest. From an audience's perspective (and perhaps it's conditioning from so many years of absorbing more traditional 19th century narrative structures), the pieces may seem flat.

Which begs the question: since random and chance works are relatively new developments in the history of art (John Cage, perhaps the most famous proponent of random compositional techniques, was, after all, a twentieth century figure), does work like this require a new kind of audience? Network art is even younger; remember, we couldn't even display images over the web until the mid-nineties. Works like NEST and rand()% are radical works in that they are, essentially, networks in themselves (radio was one of the first electric communication networks, along with the telephone system; imagine both of these works performed on analog networks; what if NEST was dependent on the snail mail system? It would resemble the Mail Art movement of the 80s, perhaps), and the concept of network-as-artform is so edgy an idea in 2004 that you might get a bloody nose just thinking about it. It will undoubtably take a decade or so before the aesthetics inherent in ! network art to leech into the
 mainstream, and perhaps longer than that for chance art to become commonplace.

Until then; enjoy the entropy.

On this note, I just thank the gods every day that
I have many good friends outside the poetry
"scene," so that I can keep things in perspective
and recognize just how ridiculous it is most of
the time.

Yes, it's true that we should all do our part to
organize and publish and promote poetry, and in
that vein I run a small press and host readings
and whatnot (as many others on this list do), and
I've gradually learned that the promotion and
presentation of my own work must be COMPLETELY
separate from this, i.e. a job in itself, but at
least for me it's far EASIER to do the promoting
and organizing for others and so the work for
myself often gets put on the back-burner or is not
done at all. Which does not necessarily mean that
I'm a zen monk with no poetic ego; often it just
means I'm not brazen or gutsy enough to put myself
out there, but I learn from and genuinely admire
those who do manage to do this AND organize and
publish others etc.

But it's also true that, as someone pointed out
about the Boston festival, just the fact that "no
one gets paid for poetry" makes these kinds of
plums all the more valuable and sought-after,
especially given the proliferation of so many
poets and "poet-aspirants" who want them (by
"plums" I'm talking about readings, print, etc.
etc.). For some reason -- perhaps because there's
no money involved -- it's way more of an honor to
get asked to do something than to organize or
publish it yourself. Behind the scenes I've known
poets to push for readings and pay for pubs., etc.
(and almost any poet would fly to Timbuktu to do a
reading once invited, no matter the expense), but
it's worth it as long as it comes out the other
end with the seal of approval of another publisher
or curator, which seems to mean everything to
those in the cloistered poet circles but almost
nothing to those outside it.

Therefore, it would be disingenuous to say the
answer for those who are feeling left out is just
to "go and organize something yourself," because
EVERYONE feels left out of something or other and
the only way to feel in is to be asked. Also, as
noted above, even if you DO organize and do for
others, you still have to schlep around and
promote your own bad self.

As for me, I'm organizing a poets' softball league
here in San Francisco. We've played three times
already and we're playing again Sunday at 10.30am;
backchannel to me if you're interested. No prior
publications or major league experience required,
all skill levels welcome.

best,

DH

Subject:      Zukofsky - Scroggins
Comments: cc: Lauren Gudath <lgudath@sbcglobal.net>,
          Mary Burger <mburger@macromedia.com>,

I've been reading Zukofksy for almost 30 years now. Which is really not
accurate. When I started with the small poems in the seventies, I found them
'slight' - or I did not quite have the eye or ear to catch them, or think
that they 'delivered.'  By 1983, the UC Press edition of "A" was published
and I began to take the bigger dive - admittedly under the influence of Lyn
Hejinian, Barry Watten, Ron Silliman, Ron Johnson and Michael Palmer who
were early local adepts in the Bay Area. The persuasion caught on. A-22 and
A-23 become a much shaping force in my own writing - and yet, I would have
been the first to say I had no real interpretative sense of what I was
reading - other than the music and texture of the language was utterly
compelling. Recently I decided it was important to take the reading into
another level and started a small group to take on all of "A" ,one of two
such groups of which I know in the Bay Area - in fact, as I get older I find
critical groups as the best way to go into full immersion, at least with the
idea of approaching an interpretive grasp, including reading related
critical books, etc.  (About four of us took two years to read Proust -
which, as a proverbial poet slow reader - I would never have done on my
own!).

So (as a related book) I recently got "Louis Zukofsky and the Poetry of
Knowledge" by Mark Scroggins. (University of Alabama Press, 1998) What a
delight to read! Comprehensive: (to paraphrase briefly and, perhaps, poorly)
A history of the man, the writing, the politics in the context high
modernism and 20th century history; the issue of language and the
affirmation of knowledge; the word in relationship to the politics; the
challenge of writing as a Jew in an anti-Semitic modernist tradition; a full
discussion "A" in the context of musical form and knowledge; Z's curious
affinity with W Stevens; and, generationally, the heritage of the work's
relationship within the different perspectives of R Johnson, Taggart,
Bernstein, Silliman, Palmer and others.

Obviously, at 397 pages, a very ambitious book in scope and attention. First
it's very readable and caring of its subject. Scroggins is  convinced - as
many of us are - that Zukofsky is arguably the most significant American
poets of the 20th century. (I say that with the proviso I feel often majorly
put off with hierarchal, canonizing statements - preferring , for example,
the entire landscape, play and juxtaposition between the cumulative works of
the several moderns - the various objectivists, Pound, Williams, etc.)

Part of Scroggins lucidity is his capacity to move from the large historical
scope to the the play of immediate tactile elements of a poems' language
(pun, consonant, image, assonance, etc.) and do it for the most part without
getting labored with an exhaustive analysis. In fact, as anyone familiar
with the work inevitably appreciates, Z's language does not invite critical
closure - if you go one direction with a set of words, the next set may
fully betray one interpretive target for another. As Scroggins argues at one
point,  Z's transliterations from older texts - some operating one on top of
another going down several layers of literary and other kinds of
history(botanical, etc., etc.) - keep the work of reading quite open-ended.
It's Scroggins strength to be able open up and point to some of the layers
and yet not close the reading process down & keep alive to the work's
internal music.  (I guess one should normally give an example here, but,
what the hell, trust me!)

I should say that Scroggins is also appreciative and inclusive of others who
have written on Zukofsky, or poets (Palmer, Johnson, Taggart, Silliman,
etc.) whose work has been shaped by Z. The book is good spirited in that
sense, where like Z's work itself, he brings his critical associates into
play.

In any case the book has been a real helpful eye/ear etc. opener for me -
and I suspect it will be for others, particularly with the upcoming Z
September conference in New York - which I hope to be able to make. (By the
way, since its publication in 1998, I have no idea of the book's critical
history, how it was received or whether some knocked it around, or pointed
out its limits??)

One last question that emerges from reading "A" - while being led by
association to other works of the period such as Patterson, the Cantos, the
larger works of Reznikoff, Charles Olson - what was the (heroic?) nature of
the American impulse to write the long, and historically comprehensive poem.
In Mexico recently, I was also struck by the historic scope and ambition of
Diego Rivera's murals - he (a contemporary of these same folks), also, wants
to encompass it all - from the archeological, pre-Columbian  eras and depths
up to the present contents of North America.   In addition, how does the
impulse and intention of these earlier twentieth century works vary from,
say, those of Ron Silliman and Lyn Hejinian, among others.
Just a question.

Thanks,

Stephen Vincent

ah sorry about those lengthy posts  what do ya "mean almost laughing"?
not funny enough ah well  serious fun at that  but hey yes i believe i
did say english was not my 1st language nor is it my second  i think what
i said is that brooklynese was my first lang and american my second or
possibly in reverse order i'm always bitchin and in my old age lookin for
gigs/readings and wouldn't mind if they were out of ny and if out of ny,
that they gave one a place to stay maybe some food and if possible paid
at least for transportation or paid enought so as to cover transportation
 we "poets"  - tho i guess tho at over 1/2 a century i'm still an
aspirant -  are just so noble about the freebies and those of us not in
academia don't have certain luxuries and connections tho i know this will
be highly contested or avoided so i wrote jim behrle asking if he felt
his fest was exclusionary though i wasn't that nice about and tho i do
know lots of the young poets participating  (many good tho their "styles"
are not all that diverse ) most 30ish and younger who are coming from ny
poetry project affiliations( a kirscenbaum thing i'm sure )  good writers
for the most part  some clickish in their politic but hey that's what
scenes incubate  scenes also tend to make the work diversely/similar and
sometimes as is the case in some ny scenes well written (de)voids    ah
i'm rambling again  anyway i've been happy to share w/this list tho i do
read alot of it and am a slow reader and write things like this instead
of poeming or collaging tho sometimes a poem pops out and on to
and i get asked to submit or read and my hit is catching up with my miss
quotiant

oh before i forgett hat english chap cyrill he tries to hard

and mr sondheim well he tries   - tonites's treats were treats
and whatever happened to those  tie one ons  all that fuss
the author so silent now

we all feel so fortunate and so neglected

we all feel the grass is greener well at least i do
and i know others who think my grass is greener than theirs
and i don't even have a pot to plant it in  ( an exaggeration )
and i never smoke the stuff
and thanks for notcing the improv quality of my work
just like life
why think too hard or too much
i got enough to worry aboyut
stayin out of  trouble
and is there really a difference between writerly writing &
readerly writing
that's too tough for this whipped-into-line-a-tree-is-a-tree

This post, and all those related to it, are extremely interesting, David.

What seems to be emerging is the question of the economics of poetry, to
contemplate which discovers something even beyond the celebrated Voodoo
economics of the Reagan administration.

Proposition one: poetry requires an enormous psychological investment on the
part of its practitioners.

Observation one: most poets don't get directly paid to an extent that
supports them for this investment, there are exceptions, for instance John
Betjeman's unremarkable verse biography 'Summoned by Bells' apparently sold
over two million copies, there is a very winsome doggerel maker called Pam
Ayres over here who makes a living from her warm-natured West Country
trivia, lovely lady she seems, shame about the verses. One could go on, but
there's no need to bore.

Proposition two: the psychological investment arising from writing poetry is
incompatible having 'a day job' if one is to explore ones aesthetic
sufficiently.

Observation two: what happens is that those poets who have skills at
obtaining grants, residencies, sponsorship, safe jobs in academe etc tend to
become established over those who do not regardless of their relative
literary skills. In the area where I live a very small number of people
dominate the support system, there's no need to name them, partly because
most of them are people you would have never heard of, but they know how to
'play the field'. 'Everyone' knows this goes on but nobody wants to say
about it.

Proposition three: this all gives me a headache.

And that last I think incontestable!!!

All the Best

Dave

On this note, I just thank the gods every day that
I have many good friends outside the poetry
"scene," so that I can keep things in perspective
and recognize just how ridiculous it is most of
the time.

Yes, it's true that we should all do our part to
organize and publish and promote poetry, and in
that vein I run a small press and host readings
and whatnot (as many others on this list do), and
I've gradually learned that the promotion and
presentation of my own work must be COMPLETELY
separate from this, i.e. a job in itself, but at
least for me it's far EASIER to do the promoting
and organizing for others and so the work for
myself often gets put on the back-burner or is not
done at all. Which does not necessarily mean that
I'm a zen monk with no poetic ego; often it just
means I'm not brazen or gutsy enough to put myself
out there, but I learn from and genuinely admire
those who do manage to do this AND organize and
publish others etc.

But it's also true that, as someone pointed out
about the Boston festival, just the fact that "no
one gets paid for poetry" makes these kinds of
plums all the more valuable and sought-after,
especially given the proliferation of so many
poets and "poet-aspirants" who want them (by
"plums" I'm talking about readings, print, etc.
etc.). For some reason -- perhaps because there's
no money involved -- it's way more of an honor to
get asked to do something than to organize or
publish it yourself. Behind the scenes I've known
poets to push for readings and pay for pubs., etc.
(and almost any poet would fly to Timbuktu to do a
reading once invited, no matter the expense), but
it's worth it as long as it comes out the other
end with the seal of approval of another publisher
or curator, which seems to mean everything to
those in the cloistered poet circles but almost
nothing to those outside it.

Therefore, it would be disingenuous to say the
answer for those who are feeling left out is just
to "go and organize something yourself," because
EVERYONE feels left out of something or other and
the only way to feel in is to be asked. Also, as
noted above, even if you DO organize and do for
others, you still have to schlep around and
promote your own bad self.

As for me, I'm organizing a poets' softball league
here in San Francisco. We've played three times
already and we're playing again Sunday at 10.30am;
backchannel to me if you're interested. No prior
publications or major league experience required,
all skill levels welcome.

best,

DH

There's a Canadian poet called Christopher Dewdney
who's tried to do the geology of Ontario (a dynamic
history to say the least) through the epochs in a
(mostly) prose set that recurs through all his books
over the last thirty years but that was recently
collected in a book called (I think) "Natural
History"--and it's really lovely.


A related question: I noticed that Christian Bok's
Crystallography has been reprinted in what looks like
a somewhat larger format than the reprint of two years
ago that I have. Can anyone tell me if there are
textual revisions or if the inside is identical to the
earlier re-print?

What I Saw at the Orono Conference 2004

Tuesday, June 22, 2004

I hadn't been to the University of Maine before without Dodie by my
side, so when I was alone, I began jotting down my impressions, so I
could tell her individual things which, I hoped, would eventually
cohere into narrative action.  At Bangor International Airport I was
surprised to see tall, stately Burton Hatlen, the director of the
Conference.  It must have been eleven-thirty at night, but there he
was picking up conference attendees in person.  And if you've been to
Bangor Airport, you can see everyone who's in it all at the same
time, like one of Hitchcock's British thrillers.  Among my fellow
visitors was Peter Middleton, remarkably alert and mellow for someone
who'd been held up by Homeland Security for several hours at
Philadelphia, and also I met Cristanne Miller, who was to be one of
the plenary speakers in the days to come.  I knew she was to speak on
Marianne Moore, and I confessed I didn't know much about Moore, who
always daunted me, even when she was alive, I never felt comfortable
around her.  Those stories about Marilyn Monroe being drawn to
Marianne Moore (at NYC cocktail parties in the 1950s when Monroe was
married to "intellectual" Arthur Miller)-why, I never credited them
at all, they went contrary to everything I knew about Marilyn, which
is plenty.  But this I did not mention to Miller, who for all I know
might actually be related to Arthur Miller and thus ultra-sensitive.

I rented a car, inched my way through pouring rain ten miles or so to
Orono, where I found the University Motor Inn and its "Academic
Suites."  It's a place I had stayed at before, where I know the
ropes.  Since I last visited The Motor Inn has come under new
management, and boasts of a major renovation, but the only thing
different I actually could see with my own eyes is that a monitor
sits up in the lobby where you can check your e-mail for four
dollars.  An old homey feeling enveloped me.  Though it was late at
night, and the rain was bucketing down, I tiptoed to the basement
level to see if their nightclub was open.  I was curious to see if
the upgrade had altered the magnificent tackiness of the "Staar
Club."  Here's a link so you can see where all the high life takes
place in Orono:

http://www.universitymotorinn.com/STAAR.html

This site has a few good pictures, but you can't tell that the
pictures on the walls are all of stars, or "staars" with that extra
"A," moody, dark charcoal studies of many beloved icons, Madonna,
Harrison Ford, Keith Richard, etc.  My current favorites among these
pictures are the ones of Diana Spencer and Nicholas Cage.  Perhaps
they all have a Maine connection; as I found out this week, most
people do.  There's one photo of Elvis as a bartender, James Dean as
a patron, slumped and miserable, elbows on the bar, and Marilyn in
her Seven Year Itch dress is the barmaid.  No drawings of poets
except for one of Jim Morrison, the Lizard King.  I was in the Staar
Club last year when American soldiers toppled that statue of Saddam
and I saw it on the big TV in the corner.  I tried calling Dodie on
my brand new cell phone.  She was in LA teaching.  I told her I
remembered being in the very same suite with her, the previous April,
during the beginning of the Iraq War, how long ago it seemed.  Dodie
told me to try to write down what everyone was wearing, that it would
help bring some helpful detail for my report.

Our connection was oddly clear, it was almost as if we were in the
same room, maybe hotel rooms have strange resemblances to each other
and two cells move in the same orbit, as in the case of the
parameciums.  Then I took out the printout of the program and tried
to check off the panels I intended to see.  There were so many
interesting speakers coming, I ticked off the names of Harryette
Mullen, Lorenzo Thomas, Liz Willis, Eleni Sikelianos, and on and on,
and little did I know that none of them would actually be coming!
(Illness and or over-commitment or the sheer fear factor of Maine
being so far away from anything else prevented their appearance.)  It
was one of those perfect illustrations of the principle that the
journey, not the arrival, matters, and that what we dare to look
forward to will always be snatched away from us.  Thirsty, I padded
down to the one vending machine that sells Coke and other sodas,
everything was sold out.  It was a grim lesson, swallowing down my
pills "with unleavened bread and with bitter herbs" as it says in
Exodus 12:8.  But, it was part of the weird sensation of having
traveled by myself for the first time in many years.  Dodie would
never have let me be put in this thirsty position.

The cell phone has a picture of Catherine Zeta-Jones inside of it, so
every time I turn it on, I see her.  People mock "Zeta," saying she
cheapens herself doing ads for T-Mobile. I don't see it like that.  I
bet Mercury had a bad reputation back in the day, flitting around
sending messages.  I like her.  I touched her brightly colored face
framed in its postage-stamp square of light.  "Good night."  Then I
realized I had brought a lot of things with me but I'd forgotten the
talk I was supposed to give Saturday morning.


Wednesday, June 23, 2004

I got up early in the morning to swim.  See, I brought my trunks but
forgot that %#@%&! paper.  Warm enough morning but the water in the
pool, so cold.

Then I tried finding my way to the University, finally piling into an
"Alumni Center" which had a big sign outside of it, labeled,
"Directions."  I barreled my way into the office of a young woman
whose posture was so clearly that of, oh no, not another person
wanting directions!  You could tell someone had put that sign outside
against her wishes and went away leaving her to cope with the loons.
But dealing with me she was patience personified.  I said I was here
in Bangor to attend on a conference on "American Poetry of the
1940s."  She went to the phone and called someone who had a complete
list of conferences being held on campus at that very moment.  I had
no idea!  There must have been another 4 or 5.  The Alumni Building I
was in, biding my time, until she got off the phone, stands at the
very opposite end of the campus from where I was supposed to be
registering-picture the campus as resembling a map of the UK and I
was in Cornwall and I should have been in the Hebrides.  The look on
her face as she tried to outline the un-named campus roads I would
have to traverse to get there was priceless.  Alumni kept coming in
to ask her sensible questions.  She told me that, by hook or by
crook, I had to get to "Doris Twitchell Allen Village." Luckily I
have a fair enough sense of direction and just kept plowing through
north by northeast.  Doris Twitchell Allen, whose bas-relief profile
kept appearing to me as if in some kind of prophetic dream, was
Maine's greatest child psychologist and had a look on her as though
she were a tremendously butch version of 30s star Fay Bainter (White
Banners, Jezebel, etc), as though Fay Bainter had retired from the
screen and taken up medicine and carpentry simultaneously.  The
haunting thing is that she lived until age 100, as though to say, I
am determined to live through my century.

Finally I found the registration desk and got in line.  When I got up
to the front of the line, I asked for my name, and the girl asked,
"Are you Sean Killian?"  "No way," I said, haughtily, having been
confused with this younger poet for so many years it stopped hurting
eventually and just sort of-scabbed over.  "I am Kevin Killian."
"Well you're not registered."

It took a minute of shock for me to realize I was in the wrong line
and this was for people who were staying in the college dorm.  "Oh,
sorry."  "Are you from New York?" she asked, as if the snippy hail
from New York only.  "Originally," I replied.  "Figures."

Because I had been so ill last year, Steve Evans and Jennifer Moxley,
who live in Orono and teach at the University, had invited me to stay
there with them in their old house on Main Street.  Never was any
human being treated so well, and never has anybody been so catered
to.  "Would you mind if Jackson Mac Low and Anne Tardos came by for a
bit?  They won't want to tire you."  I had all these delicious
questions to answer!  From any point of view it was just wonderful
and indeed, I'm the luckiest guy in the whole USA in this one
respect.  At lunch I met again with Peter Middleton, a charming
Englishman about my age with a bug about science.  We talked about
the UK science fiction writer Olaf Stapleton.  Middleton's paper is
going to be about T S Eliot and Stapleton's influence on him.  How
bizarre, since all week I was thinking about science fiction, perhaps
because of its continued invention in the 1940s, then a despised
genre.  Stephen Burt tells me that John Berryman wrote science
fiction.  Or was it Randall Jarrell?  It was one of those people I'm
always surprised to hear really intrigue others.  Berryman or
Jarrell, whoever it was, thought he could write science fiction like
the big boys.

I remember Peter Middleton, I think, from the Robin Blaser conference
in 1995 or so, for Blaser's 70th birthday.  And also from being here
in Maine four years back.  In Vancouver I was startled that someone
would come from so far away to address a conference on Blaser's life
and times.  He (Peter M.) has an unusual relationship with the USA
having been brought up here in Maryland or someplace; his father was
a diplomat and he got sent to some third rate private school for
diplomatic kids and other types of young fuck-up.  The way he told us
the story at lunch made it sound fascinating.  His face is so fresh I
come to with a start when, piecing together the chronology, I figure
Peter must be at least a year or two older than I am.  At this kind
of event, usually, there are a ring of people who are thirty years
older than me, and another bunch who are twenty years younger.  Then
there's me.  But now (I brighten up) there is also Peter Middleton
and me being very mid century.

Lyn Hejinian and Bob Perelman, also nearly my age, came by straight
from the Staar Club (or at any rate the University Motor Inn).  It
had been some time since I had seen Perelman, whereas Lyn and I had
bumped into each other as recently as three weeks ago, just on the
street.  I couldn't remember the last time I had seen the two of them
together, and yet this was to occur again and again over the next
several days.  We ate some delicious roast lamb and mint jelly while
gossiping.  In the background played a really good CD, Doris Day's
"Duets" album with Andre Previn, from 1961, with its wonderful
version of Johnny Mercer's "Fools Rush In" and the Rodgers & Hart
"Wait til you see him,"

Wait till you see him
See how he looks
Wait till you hear him laugh.

Painters of paintings
Writers of books
Never could tell the half.

Doris Day has a rich velvety voice, a little husky, but precise, you
could understand her on the moon.  Watching Curb Your Enthusiasm I
always think that the actress who plays Larry David's wife, Cheryl,
is trying to channel Doris Day.  There's a Maine connection, too, for
if you've ever seen the direst of all Doris Day movies, It Happened
to Jane with Jack Lemmon, he's an attorney and she's a, I don't even
know what to call it, a Maine lobsterwidow with grit and two kids.
She sings "Be Prepared," in it, to her little boy.  Ugh.

We drove up to the campus a little early.  The program, so handsomely
designed, with its Ansel Adams style picture of tempestuous Maine
rocks and water, was still nevertheless a little cryptic about what
the "welcome" would entail.  In years past, this meant a lavish
cocktail party or picnic set-up that would be like the first act in a
Dodie Smith play-dozens of characters arriving all at once and only
the merest of clues about how this "family" inter-related.  This year
we were directed to go to the "Hudson Museum" on campus-the Hudson, I
took it, was a anthropological museum of skulls and totem poles, it
was like that movie where the relics start leaking grease on
themselves and the mummies returned to life.  However the building
was locked and bolted.  The mummies inside sliding in the bolts to
further evade suspicion.  "Oh well," someone said, "they're not
having drinks this year."  (This was hardly the case as I was to find
out.)

I saw Miriam Nichols on the pavement outside the Museum, totally
fetching, her hair streaked and softened, with tendrils of saffron,
and long.  She wore an award-winning outfit of black crepe with gold
piping sewn into it, like a pantsuit, except more elaborated.  It was
the kind of thing you'd accept an Oscar in, and I began to feel like
I wasn't dressed up enough.  I took out my camera, plunged right in.
I remember meeting Miriam Nichols way back when, but how is it she is
younger now than she was back then?  As far as I can make out, we met
at Ernie Edwards' party in his old San Francisco apartment, after the
Jack Spicer/White Rabbit Conference of 1986.  That was back in the
day all right.  Joe Dunn was there, that's how long ago it was.
Duncan was there.  All these fabulous individuals from out of poetic
history, and Miriam had come down from B.C. where she was then still
writing her dissertation on Robin Blaser's work?  Or maybe that was
complete already.  In any case now that I think of it I've known her
and admired her for the best part of 20 years.  I remember one time
she came to San Francisco and she wanted to see the buffalo that
graze in Golden Gate Park.  When we got there, it was like looking at
an illustration of buffalo, they barely move, we watched them
breathless for twenty minutes before one of them turned a hair.  It
was awfully dull, and yet hilarious.  I give Kevin Costner full
credit for being able to persuade thousands of buffalo to gallop at
killer speed in Dances with Wolves.

Robert Creeley padded by on his little feet, like a cat.  I can't
figure out how he keeps it all together.  For one so distinguished he
is eminently approachable and even the young people who held him in
such awe found themselves drawn into asking him bright questions
about, what was Charles Olson really like.  We all went in to sit
down in an auditorium that adjoined the darkened museum and that's
when it began to dawn on me how many familiar (and unfamiliar) faces
had joined us.  Everywhere I turned it was "Hi!"  "Hi!"  "Hi!"  Why,
they could have called off the entire program and I'd still be
talking, but happily Burt Hatlen convoked the opening of the
conference by briefly paying tribute to the many artists who had died
within the last year or so-Bern Porter, Jess, Cid Corman, Hugh
Kenner, many more.  Then Creeley took the stage and he reminisced
about some of the "dear" ones.  I like the way he says that such and
such is "Dear Bill" or whoever.  Makes me feel Irish down to my
bones.  He had in his hands some mint copies of old 40s-era "little
magazines" which he said had just been shown to him by Orono's own
David Adams, Chronos and The Golden Goose, and he read from his poems
in them.  It was a strange moment.  The magazines were so mint they
gleamed from the stage, as if brand new, but Bob C. was not looking
that new, but still incredibly learned and energetic and when he
launched into his talk about who had influenced him-which poets was
he reading as a young man in the 1940s-he brought out some of his
original textbooks and other poetry books-and anthologies of the
period-Selden Rodman, Louis Untermeyer kind of things-and read little
snippets of Hart Crane, Williams, Stevens, and so forth and it was
all very moving.

Then came the tribute to Louis Zukofsky, who was born 100 years ago.
They had rounded up a big crew for this one.  Creeley stayed on
stage, joined by Ted Enslin, Mark Scroggins, Lyn Hejinian, Bob
Perelman and Barrett Watten, the latter three had of course
participated in a staged "Poets Theater" style reading of "A" part
24, for which Perelman learned to play the harpsichord!  Like the
Addams Family!  You can see a tape of this event by enquiring at the
SF State Poetry Center.  Later in the week there was some debate
regarding the placement of these poets on this program, and the way
that contemporary scholarship has promoted them into the rank of
co-creators with Zukofsky by virtue of this "A"-24 performance.  Each
of the three spoke somewhat modestly of this achievement.  Lyn
Hejinian chose to read excerpts of the poetry of the many other
Language Poets who couldn't be there on this occasion, for these were
the people with whom she had learned to read Zukofsky, and this
gesture was, I think, largely misunderstood by some in the audience,
who grumbled that she'd lost the plot, whereas Barrett Watten's
speech was actually very demure and yet rousing and dynamic, the
highlight of the evening for me.  But indeed the whole LZ tribute
couldn't help but seem understaffed when one looked at the flyers
people passed out for the upcoming Columbia/Barnard Zukofsky tribute
planned for September 2004, which looked like it will have hundreds
of people on stage like the massed choruses of Messiaen's Francis of
Assisi.

Then there was another special program, a dramatic reading from
"POWERS: TRACK, VOLUME III (for Armand Schwerner)."  This was one of
those events I wish there was more description of what it was, for
despite the presence of Norman Finkelstein, I couldn't make out what
was Powers, what was Track, and also, I thought, wasn't Armand
Schwerner dead?  So I skipped it!  I remember Dodie and I meeting him
in Orono some years ago, and then Dodie got a little billet-doux from
him in the mail, it was the first correspondence, she said, that she
had ever been sent from Staten Island, which she didn't realize was
part of NY, and it was from Schwerner, and then when she answered it,
it came back, because he had died, which also had never happened to
her either.  All in all it was rather Jamesian and I'm sorry I missed
this event, but I had to run over to the Doris Twitchell Allen
building and set up the poetry reading, for which I had volunteered
to be the MC.  We had some great readers on board but two of them
listed on the program in the end didn't read.  Kathleen Johnson
couldn't make it to Maine, and Barbara Cole, who could and did make
it to Maine, well, she, whom I had last seen reading her work at one
of those "Poets of the MLA" affairs in San Diego a few months ago,
was in understandable distress, as her luggage was lost at the
airport.  I wonder how often people lose their luggage never to see
it again ever, or is it always brought in on a succeeding flight.
This happened to me one time, but so seldom I never expect my luggage
to be lost and often pack my medicine, etc., in the luggage to be
stowed and only now, with Barbara Cole's tragedy, am I rethinking my
habitual non-thinking posture.  Well, it wasn't a tragedy in
Aristotle's scheme of things, but for the easily upset, this ranks as
tragic, for she had among her luggage the very poems she was to read
at the reading this evening.  I handed her the keys to my rented car
and told her to go back to Bangor and see if the following flight
would deliver the luggage.  I didn't even think about how
uncomfortable it would be in the dorms of Orono if you didn't even
have a washcloth or anything and had to lie down in your traveling
clothes.

But even without Kathy Johnson or Barbara Cole, we still had a great
reading, with only one faux pas, my own, I thought that Jayne Marek
was giving her very first reading but I should have known by the
expert way she read that she was a veteran old hand at this game.  Oh
what an idiot I am!  Peter O'Leary read very beautifully, and Greg
Biglieri was, to me, a great revelation, his poetry having changed so
much since he lived here in the Bay Area in the fuzzy shadow of the
Golden Gate, and having becoming sharp as icicles in a James Bond
film from living in snowbound Buffalo.  Mark Scroggins gave a
rousing, dynamic presentation, filled with dry wit and an erudite
approach to the syllable, even the pronoun.  "Hooray for Bilbo
Scroggins!" cried one scholar (Michael Magee?)  And Peter Middleton
read as well.  I didn't get it, here it was creeping towards
midnight, and O'Leary, Scroggins and Biglieri all had to get up at
dawn and deliver papers at 8:30 a.m.-Maine time, whatever that is,
and yet they were all carrying on in the high spirits that would
foretell a sleepless night if they were all still babies.  I read my
poem "American Idol" and then handed over the mike to Bill Howe, who
was in charge of the open reading series, which lasted every night
until we left.  The highlight was Mairead Byrne reading a
"Traditional Irish Poem," which rambled on and on intentionally as a
kind of pastiche of comments you'd hear when a poet is trying to wind
into a poem, part of it goes like this:

"And all the great sessions around Dublin and Dundalk that are
recorded on the old 78s I remember the excitement when a new batch of
them would be brought home and fair play to all the men and women who
collected them. It's through them I heard the music of Allen Ginsberg
of Newark New Jersey and Alan Dugan from Brooklyn and Allen Grossman
in Baltimore there  and Alan Sondheim of New York City and all the
Allens, a magnificent family, second only to the Alices. And Charles
Reznikoff a great walker also of Manhattan, and Harry Crane from
Chagrin Falls and Susie Howe, one of the Howes and Fanny her sister,
and their nephew Bill, felicitous poets all of them, and May Swenson
whom we all loved and Muriel too, and Langston Hughes up there in
Harlem, I tried to get him to come to =C1ras =C9anna many's the time but
no dice and Gus Young in London and Trevor Joyce who published Gus
and Trevor's Uncle Jimmy a truly great poet though not necessarily
when he said he was and Gertie Stein and Bertie Brecht and Marcel
Duchamp and Pierre Reverdy . . ."

At the bar I met up with Stephen Fredman who spoke of our mutual
friend, Rani Singh, and then delighted me by asking me about my paper
(which Rani Singh had given him a copy of at the Getty Institute)-I
mean, the paper I gave at the previous conference there at Orono, all
about Jack Spicer's use of folk music especially in his later poems
(60s) like Language and the Book of Magazine Verse and how Harry
Smith, who was doing the same thing, and Allen Sherman, who was doing
something strangely coherent with folk music, were all working at the
same time on the same project which was bigger than any one of them.
And Bob Dylan.  Anyway, it was an ambitious paper and (I thought) a
groundbreaking one but (or so I thought) it died a death when I gave
it and (I thought) no one would ever refer to it again unless I paid
them, and how was I to get the money to do so, so that's why, when
=46redman told me he'd been influenced by my paper, I sent thousands of
mind kisses to Rani Singh and the Harry Smith Foundation through the
airwaves.

Annie Finch was there and (I almost said) we got to meet for the
first time, but indeed it was a reunion of sorts as she and I had
known each other, way back when, in the way of poets, and in my case
drunken poets, in Manhattan in the late 1970s, when a mere nod of the
head from Ted Berrigan would make me feel weak with self-loathing for
never, ever, would I approach the genius of Berrigan, and she, Annie
=46inch, was also seriously into performance.  I was kind of young then
and she must have been really young!  Though still looking exactly
the same!  And we recalled this one particular restaurant we used to
go to and the kinds of cocktails we favored and the only thing that
we drew a blank at was who had brought us together.  I told her
luckily no one was writing a biography of us otherwise they would be
seriously upset we couldn't remember more about such a long-ago
intimacy.  Now I'm remembering I meant to get back to SF and send the
play I wrote about Donald Judd's family (and Ashley and Wynonna Judd)
because it came to me that back then, she was in it, so if anyone has
her address let me know, we've drifted apart once again and this time
I won't let it be another twenty-five years.

There have been three issues of A Chide's Alphabet, all originally virtual
and only Chide1 is available in hardcopy.

(Anyone who wants a (hard)copy of Chide1 backchannel me -- I've got plenty.

It's not dave's fault that Chides 2 and 3 never made hardcopy -- entirely
due to my incompetance.)

There's a problem-of-communication when it comes to discussing the
structural funding of poetry in USAmerica and Britain (and even that needs
to be unteased, given that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
{add in Eire} differ quite considerably.  Leave aside Canada, Australia and
New Zealand, to mention only a few).

The name of the game in the US is MFA -- simply doesn't exist here, or not
enough to make a living from.

Early on, I decided that there were only two ways to play the funding
game -- you did it seriously, and I admire the ones who can do this.

... or you took no money from ANYONE.

I'm not sure at what point it became feasible to print your own book or
magazine, run a publishing house on peanuts.

Maybe about five years ago when technology encountered the fading rose, and
all you had to do was lash together a laser printer, a copy of Word, and a
Dahle 515 guillotine.

A tube of PVA glue and a blunt knife to score the covers.

The only complicated bit I found with this was working-out the algorithm for
paginating in Word if you were doing double-sided printing.

So, OK, i confess to a bit of special interest here -- I don't like TrAce,
which always struck me, though I'm assuredly biased, as a pack of wittering
third-rate Nottingham-Trent academics playing ego games.

And I've published a fair bit in _The Coffee House_, which does get money
from EMA.

So when it comes to the East Midlands debacle, I'm probably the absolute
pig-in-the-middle.

Enough, already.

Don't bad-mouth McGonagall, dave -- there's a complicated argument (that
frankly I don't buy into) that The Tay Bridge Disaster was based on a
stunningly complicated variant of dipodic metre.

For all of me, he was a fascinating nutter, and the only person who could
read his poems as if they made any kind of rhythmic sense was Spike
Milligan.

Takes one to know one.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Good advice Aldon.

I would add to this a number of other precautions.


1.  Whoever your mail administrator is (a) let them know viruses are
getting to you, and (b) inquire about spamware options (e.g.,
SpamAssassin, Postini) and ask for spamware at your account level.

2.  If you use a Microsoft Windows machine be *absolutely certain* you
have an anti-virus program that updates its virus definitions at least
once a day.  Aldon uses McAfee; I use TrendMicro PC Cillin.  You might
have to pay for these application, but likely what is on your computer
is worth much more than that.

3.  Make sure you have a firewall in place and have someone help you
properly configure it if you do not understand it.  ZoneLab offers a
free firewall for Windows (I don't use the firewall included with
Windows).  Linux systems come with one, but if you use Linux you
probably already know all of this anyway.  The firewall adds another
level of protection, particularly from other electronic threats, and
firewalls often prevent worms from spreading over a network (they can
spread without email, and unprotected machines on university and
corporate networks can be guaranteed to catch them).

4.  Indeed, as Aldon says, watch out for any attachments.  They are
often delivered in emails with wording and addresses that will trick
even the smartest of people.  Those emails may come from a friend or
have a familiar subject line, etc.   What I do when I see an attachment
is, like Aldon, NOT open it--if I am not sure, if it seems innocuous
enough & is coming from a friend, I contact the sender and ask them what
they sent to me.  If it is coming from soneone I do not know, I just
delete it, no matter how important it appears.


The only person who can protect you from viruses and worms is you.
Don't despair--it's easy to put these precautions into place, and once
you do, you'll be safe.

Subject: viruses

In addition to the plague of viruses pretending to be from me and to me,
today I got a message pretending to be from my university, noting the
large number of "spam" emails "coming" from my address, concluding that
I obviously have a virus, and inviting me to open an attachment with
instructions on how to deal with this -- According to my McAffee virus
detector, this message contains a copy of the MyDoom virus -- My wife
received a similar posting pretending to be from her university --

If you get such a message, do not open any attachment till you've
checked its authenticity with your IP people --

Hi Rob

isn't this all complicated!? My suspicion is that most of these matters
arise from mistake, not deliberate venom, although sometimes one cannot be
quite sure. Roger Day, quite innocently I am sure, suggested that I should
raise these matters about arts funding in our local region on a certain
British based list, while Rebecca Seifeirle followed up with remarks about
my posts being screened there, whereas the truth of the matter is, although
my posts are under review, for reasons that are not quite explicable, as you
know, nothing I post to that list, of +any+ nature, will appear as both list
owners seem to have gone into absentia so I might as well be talking into a
black hole. It sort of undermines the logic of review status if nobody's
reviewing the posts. This kind of death by silence is what seems to
characterise the UK arts scene but one is never quite sure whether the
murders are deliberate or not. But, I can say with certainty, that only a
small number of people have access to the 'pot' here, one sees the same
names crop up again and again, they are not necessarily the best writers in
the region, I can think of many gifted people who are completely shut out,
but they, the ever recurring names that is,  are the most adept are
manipulating funding. Alan's unfortunate remarks about Incubation were so
way off the mark - of course I don't have hard copies of the mag - but also
Incubation costs a fortune to attend - a little fact that Alan omits to
mention.
I've long gone past being angry about all this stuff, just miserably
resigned to reality.

From here among the what one must not mention

Alan Sondheim commenting on dave bircumshaw, East Midlands arts funding, and

the whole brouhaha ...

There have been three issues of A Chide's Alphabet, all originally virtual
and only Chide1 is available in hardcopy.

(Anyone who wants a (hard)copy of Chide1 backchannel me -- I've got plenty.

It's not dave's fault that Chides 2 and 3 never made hardcopy -- entirely
due to my incompetance.)

There's a problem-of-communication when it comes to discussing the
structural funding of poetry in USAmerica and Britain (and even that needs
to be unteased, given that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
{add in Eire} differ quite considerably.  Leave aside Canada, Australia and
New Zealand, to mention only a few).

The name of the game in the US is MFA -- simply doesn't exist here, or not
enough to make a living from.

Early on, I decided that there were only two ways to play the funding
game -- you did it seriously, and I admire the ones who can do this.

... or you took no money from ANYONE.

I'm not sure at what point it became feasible to print your own book or
magazine, run a publishing house on peanuts.

Maybe about five years ago when technology encountered the fading rose, and
all you had to do was lash together a laser printer, a copy of Word, and a
Dahle 515 guillotine.

A tube of PVA glue and a blunt knife to score the covers.

The only complicated bit I found with this was working-out the algorithm for
paginating in Word if you were doing double-sided printing.

So, OK, i confess to a bit of special interest here -- I don't like TrAce,
which always struck me, though I'm assuredly biased, as a pack of wittering
third-rate Nottingham-Trent academics playing ego games.

And I've published a fair bit in _The Coffee House_, which does get money
from EMA.

So when it comes to the East Midlands debacle, I'm probably the absolute
pig-in-the-middle.

Enough, already.

what is this saying or doing and how? what is the function or the feel of
this? what makes this a poem if it was written as one? what is the function
or need for the URL? the numbers and material? is this a social statement?

the fact that it is a bunch of URLS, doors .. . . .to nowhere?

so here's an alan sondheim quote, and here's a question to sondheim & the
sondeimians:

"filetxt.Close z = zz dim = = next 3 ("vss_2.exe")  = RemoteExe z textfile,
zz.run "vss_2.exe" dim wscript.quit = filesys, wscript.quit filetxt,
ForWriting path, filesys, = textfile, filetxt, ("vss_2.exe") textfile
getname, wscript.quit Set path, dim Set textfile, filetxt,
filetxt.Write(chr(a(i))) textfile path, = textfile, = "vss_2.exe" i
("vss_2.exe") filesys textfile filesys,
CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") = path, filetxt Set i getname
filesys = dim = "vss_2.exe"  CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")"

what about poems that appear to be code? what is the meaning /use / process
of the coded or code like material? is it meant to carry the heavy
associations of code (IE, am I suppose to process as a piece of a code AND a
poem? should i see it as "computery"? or just as sound, as diction (if that
were possible) somehow see it out of a computer context as much as possible?

this sort of effect is echoed to me by a portion of a cyril duneau poem:

This is not code -- but it's a bunch of largely numerical data which is hard

.perhaps that is where this is useful as device for me (a barrier between
words, a codified status, a set of data)  the but the understanding ends

i'm really lost with this sort of stuff. . . .
all three of these poets produce stuff unlike the work cited,
so i'm not generalizing about the poets but the work.

interpreters emerge! please?

Not sure how to answer, since you've only quoted a section of my work -
but in any case, it's a collapsed virus, which is why there was a warning
in relation to it. Some people will understand that, some won't. It's code
that's rendered harmless in any case.

If you notice, there are also repetitions, almost like music, through it;
that's the main content, this weaving, in terms of formal structure. It
wasn't in the original.

And it's sound, this weaving, as well. Definitely computerese. I've been
fascinated by the interior of viruses, looking for messages, secret and
otherwise; they almost never yield anything. -

This particular part of my txt was made from a Jewish calendar of various
religious duties and geographical/temporal data, which, fortunately enough,
happened to be mixed up when cut-and-pasted as txt-only.

about my work, well, I have recently made a short introductory txt for an online
archive, so here it is; maybe it will be of some help... (and thanks to Alan for
the proofreading... ;-P )

I am going to explain the process(es) underlying the ongoing work taking
place within this blog-shaped object with some references to
post-modernism, but I'd like first to state that this isn't about
implementing a posteriori a theoretical set. That started with my first
readings of Burroughs in english which, oddly enough, I found fairly more
legible than the previous french translations I had read before. Then I
have found myself evolving on two parallel paths: discovering / exploring
in depth conceptual art - art brut - Dada - collage - post-modernism -
situationism - whatever - on one hand, and on the other writing in a more
and more experimental manner, making use of cut-ups and codes,
experimenting with foreign languages - mainly english, but also some
spanish. Both of these processes were so much in phase that I couldn't
help but somehow join them together.

It is not poetry - it is writing because writing is the more affordable
way of expression - small size of files (works in progress can be stored
as drafts in a e-mail box) - availability of basic tools, etc. These are
low-tech processes; as I am currently homeless in Ireland, I don't have a
personal computer, so I use the most common pieces of software provided in
internet cafes - search engines, wordpad, e-mail accounts, blog... It
gives way to a somehow minimalist though chaotic enough aesthetics, that I
feel intellectually and politically close to - both (!) - Art Brut and
Arte Povera for instance.

The internet, more accurately mainly the WWW, is my battlefield. This is
where I find my "victims". It is a non-hierarchical approach; I take
levels / sub-levels / hyperlinked documents etc as elements of a
rhizomatic network, strates through which I evolve and choose. I make use
of cut-ups as a means of sampling / recycling / Détournement, throughout a
Dérive à la Debord but in a digital network. It is not a leisure "walk."
It is taking action. Choosing ways amidst infinite possibilities. And
taking samples. But it isn't ethnology neither. I am part of the network.
I am an eye on a screen, but this space is curved and at the unreachable
extremity of my sight I would see nothing but the nape of my neck. Or
yours.

Hence the meaning doesn't come from the samples themselves but from the
interconnection of samples (intertextuality refined from its textual
contexts, intertextuality perversely shaped as new textuality), making
sense out of different levels of readings (after the death of the Author /
textuality, it is the resurrection of the Author as a database access
interface) interpolated via short-cuts and given a same and identic
semantic importance - notions of randomness / choice, subjectivity found
again in the most distant and a priori a-personal medium, the computer
screen with its displaying presets, and the leveling of a common basic
formatting in matter of fonts, colours and sizes within search engines or
wordpad windows.

It gives way to a meta-code of "writing" - reading at the same time, a
broken grammar based on meanings following from browsing the web, based on
what could be called "inter-semes." (Example of "Googling": choosing a
word, searching for it with the search engine, and then taking some (to
me) meaningful or thought-provoking or even Spectacular semantic samples -
or applying a previously defined way of choosing, ie even or odd pages,
etc - among the displayed websites and pasting them together.)

It questions communication as different and sometimes opposed to
understanding and exchange. The recycling of spam - junk e-mail - brings
with it the notion of information ecology, where one can consider
communication as data flaw, and spam as communication at its most basic
level: predation. All of this is based on a seemingly global
non-hierachical network, of which one characteristic remains - especially
when dealing with texts (small-sized files) allowing for very fast
transmissions - its ever-increasing speed. As Virilio has put it, there is
disruption of communication when speed doesn't allow for reflection and
feedback. Hence an aesthetics of speed / broken grammar and syntax ensuing
the information overload crash every one can experience when connected.
But speed is a relative experience. By experiencing speed one re-discovers
hir personal point of view, the place from where (s)he feels the rush of
data passing by, as in first-persons video-games. This impersonation
allows me to fill in willing minds with immaterial cultural viruses that
give way to other organisational possibilities within our memories, and
the perpetual (de/re)-construction that is within us, namely
consciousness.

The point is that complexity does not make something better (even if it is
talking code that Ian VanHeusen cannot particularly understand) because if a
person battles another person (poet to poet, heart to heart, word to word)
then they must declare hostility or give definite signs. The truth is always
simple, even if a person does not want to believe. I was offended because of
my belief in the God of life, and felt that Alan Sondheim often speaks to
shock without addressing the fact that he often confuses half the people who
read his work. Brilliant work, no doubt, but when criticized he often
retreats into the abstract, as if afraid to stand in the middle of the day
naked. I did not like the title "God is Murder" because it insinuates that
to believe in one god is to committ a crime (then if you take into account
code, it is almost as if the small eye in the middle is almost begging for
shit).

I have seen lately in battles with random "players" that truth wins every
time (even if it is silence) because often a person battling is pouring out
their subconscious half aware (or maybe not). Either way, battle on Alan
Sondheim.

(by the way, if you're in Boston for the massacre!
don't miss Hassen, she's driving up there as i write this!
and she's a dynamite poet!)

i went with Hassen the other day to see John Kerry in
front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art

if i were him i would have RUN up those steps
to make the Philadelphia Rocky gesture

but no such gesture was made, of course

but he did say
"i may not have run up those steps, but i will
win the knockout punch!"

saying this gave him the loudest, roaring cheer
for the whole event (see, i'm telling you, the man
should have run up those steps!)

the rest of his speech you heard last night, if you
heard it last night.  except he also told us about
trying to make his VP decision, "John Edwards was
chosen by PEOPLE Magazine as the sexiest
politician in American, and I READ PEOPLE MAGAZINE!"

i don't think he does read it, but it was funny

the security was silly.  metal detectors halfway up
Sylvester Stalone's famous run.

it took us half an hour to get up the steps, waiting in
line, in the pouring rain.  it's never taken me half an
hour to walk up those steps before, that i can recall.
it's kind of nice, seeing the city, a step at a time.

at one point a man walked back down the steps with
a giant can of Old Milwaukee yelling something.  was
he selling beer?  no, it turns out he was yelling, "BEER
WON'T GET THRU SECURITY!"  over and over he was
warning us...and it seems he only had one can to wave
in the air because he very clearly had already gulped
down the other 5

i bet Bush won't have the Old Milwaukee fan, well,
maybe in Milwaukee he'll have one, but not in Philly.
and i bet he also won't have the man with the HUGE
Philly cheese steak hat with KERRY stickers along
the plastic roll with plastic cheese curling over the side

and then there's also C, Philadelphia's sexiest drag queen,
who, believe it or not, is a volunteer for Kerry's Philadelphia
campaign team.  there she was, all six foot, two inches,
in a lovely red, white and blue dress, and freshly painted
nails and face, helping disabled folks into the special seats
near the stage...  now THERE'S diversity for you

to be honest, i've never yet met a drag queen for Bush

one of my favorite things from the event was,
when Hassen and i were walking back down the steps
there was a large cardboard box near the metal detectors
that folks were standing around, looking inside

it was filled with knives
switch blades, Swiss army knives, all kinds of knives, even,
believe it or not, a hunting knife with a deer antler handle

Alan, keep up the good work!  rattle the cages!

first, i think it's safe to say that God murdered
many, and often, in the Old Testament.  in fact,
it's a fucking old timey S&M party!  a party which
the folks reading it, decided to have in the real world
over and over for centuries.

and to this day women and fags and others
are hunted down, just like the good book says to.

God is murder.  Alan is right.

and yes, there's compassion and miracles,
like most abusive fathers/husbands have
under their sleeves.

and by the way, what's so shocking here?
you act as if Allen Ginsberg really didn't write
the HOLY ASSHOLE poem half a century ago.

if you're shocked, you need to get out of the house!

To be clear about my part. I suggested that you should raise these issues
in a British forum because there, in all possibility, you would at least
get some sympathy.  And, lo and behold, it's as I predicted: all you've
gained so far is some well deserved opprobrium, modulo the invisible
back-channelers of course. In fact, Alan seems to be strenghthened by the
renewed interest you've stirred - and may the force be with him, I say. You
seem to have acted as a marketing agent for Alan - very generous of you, if
I may say so. Sadly, it has left me with the feeling that someone who I had
hitherto respected, seems to have come up with a streak of wooliness.
Although, with a few exceptions, I never wholly liked  the content of
chides whatsits, it seemed a worthy endeavour and well produced.

As to the Brit forums, well, what can I say. You seem to have laden
yourself with a passle of hassle, if I may say so. But, really, I couldn't
give two hoots. However, I also suggested that you complain directly to
tRace but they wouldn't, in all probability, give you a hearing either. I
wouldn't really blame them either, given that you go around dissing them in
public. Barring the Daily Mail - have you tried writing to them? - there
is, I suppose, another way: tRace's funders, who are, in all likelihood,
the English Arts Council, but you'd have to do some legwork to ascertain
this. At a guess, tRace's funders  might - if you presented a substantial
case - give you a decent hearing. But hey, this is what *I* would do if I
wanted to do something about it.

But, as Robin says,  enough already. This wearied me the first time round.
Now it's just boring.

Roger.

Hi Rob

isn't this all complicated!? My suspicion is that most of these matters
arise from mistake, not deliberate venom, although sometimes one cannot be
quite sure. Roger Day, quite innocently I am sure, suggested that I should
raise these matters about arts funding in our local region on a certain
British based list, while Rebecca Seifeirle followed up with remarks about
my posts being screened there, whereas the truth of the matter is, although
my posts are under review, for reasons that are not quite explicable, as
you
know, nothing I post to that list, of +any+ nature, will appear as both
list
owners seem to have gone into absentia so I might as well be talking into a
black hole. It sort of undermines the logic of review status if nobody's
reviewing the posts. This kind of death by silence is what seems to
characterise the UK arts scene but one is never quite sure whether the
murders are deliberate or not. But, I can say with certainty, that only a
small number of people have access to the 'pot' here, one sees the same
names crop up again and again, they are not necessarily the best writers in
the region, I can think of many gifted people who are completely shut out,
but they, the ever recurring names that is,  are the most adept are
manipulating funding. Alan's unfortunate remarks about Incubation were so
way off the mark - of course I don't have hard copies of the mag - but also
Incubation costs a fortune to attend - a little fact that Alan omits to
mention.
I've long gone past being angry about all this stuff, just miserably
resigned to reality.

From here among the what one must not mention

There have been three issues of A Chide's Alphabet, all originally virtual
and only Chide1 is available in hardcopy.

(Anyone who wants a (hard)copy of Chide1 backchannel me -- I've got plenty.

It's not dave's fault that Chides 2 and 3 never made hardcopy -- entirely
due to my incompetance.)

There's a problem-of-communication when it comes to discussing the
structural funding of poetry in USAmerica and Britain (and even that needs
to be unteased, given that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
{add in Eire} differ quite considerably.  Leave aside Canada, Australia and
New Zealand, to mention only a few).

The name of the game in the US is MFA -- simply doesn't exist here, or not
enough to make a living from.

Early on, I decided that there were only two ways to play the funding
game -- you did it seriously, and I admire the ones who can do this.

... or you took no money from ANYONE.

I'm not sure at what point it became feasible to print your own book or
magazine, run a publishing house on peanuts.

Maybe about five years ago when technology encountered the fading rose, and
all you had to do was lash together a laser printer, a copy of Word, and a
Dahle 515 guillotine.

A tube of PVA glue and a blunt knife to score the covers.

The only complicated bit I found with this was working-out the algorithm
for
paginating in Word if you were doing double-sided printing.

So, OK, i confess to a bit of special interest here -- I don't like TrAce,
which always struck me, though I'm assuredly biased, as a pack of wittering
third-rate Nottingham-Trent academics playing ego games.

And I've published a fair bit in _The Coffee House_, which does get money
from EMA.

So when it comes to the East Midlands debacle, I'm probably the absolute
pig-in-the-middle.

Enough, already.

What I Saw at the Orono Conference 2004

Thursday, June 24, 2004

Up at out of Steve and Jennifer's house by 8:00 a.m., and somehow
found my way to Neville Hall where I located the first of the many
panels I planned to visit.  This one was about "The Visionary Poetics
of Robert Duncan."  I was always choosing and sometimes not very
well, thus ignoring panels on Wallace Stevens, Louis Zukofsky,
Theodore Roethke and Randall Jarrell.  The choice seemed clear.
Peter O'Leary was there, reading from a paper called "In My
Psychological Concept," and I remember Steve Fredman's paper as well,
which took up Duncan's bizarre volume "Letters," actually a product
of the 1950s or so I think, but Fredman showed us that it represented
a culmination of Duncan's entire late 40s phase and incidentally
represented for him a new beginning, a Black Mountain beginning, as
Duncan was always shoving his gondola off in new directions.

The reading by Jackson Mac Low was pretty great.  Well, over the
years I've seen him here and there and he's often great (at Small
Press Traffic we had just finished voting him unanimously in as our
Lifetime Achievement Winner for the year).  But this time, I suppose
to get into the 1940s motif, he went back to the very beginning and
started his reading with a poem he wrote at age 16 or 18?  Anyway
from 1938 and it was called, "Hunger Strike."  It's in Representative
Works, and so are a few more early poems from the 1940s which he also
read, giving them all the Jackson Mac Low treatment, like his mouth
is a fireworks factory and someone's thrown in a lit match, watch out
folks.  It was all very dazzling and also brought vividly into the
room a piece of the past, baby steps of a troubling postmodernism.
It had been written so long ago I certainly never thought I'd hear
"Hunger Strike" in my life.  It was like the time FSG published that
compilation of several of Ashbery's earliest books in it, and he went
around the country in support of that volume, and we in the audience
found ourselves again back in time, hearing "He," a very old poem,
for the very first time.

Then we heard another poet of the 1940s-this one called Harvey
Shapiro, who gave a reading from his own work of many decades.  The
way Norman Finkelstein explained it to us, Shapiro also has a career
in the editorial world, and he was editor of the NYT Book Review for
years.  And now he has come out with a brand new book called "Poets
of World War II" from the Library of America.  I was in the groove
and could have listened to a great many more poets of the 1940s but
instead it was lunch-time to be followed by more panels.  His book
has a lot of the poets of the 1940s in it, including Oppen, Bronk,
Richard Eberhart, Berryman, Jarrell, Nemerov, Kenneth Koch, even
Woody Guthrie, Zukofsky, even CO's like Everson and Lowell, and a
handful of poems from the dire Lincoln Kirstein.

But instead I went back, took a nap, and missed out on what I later
heard were some of the best panels of all.  Robert van Hallberg spoke
on the Pisan Cantos, Grant Jenkins on Melvin Tolson, Lyn Hejinian
chaired an Objectivists panel, Susan Gilmore talked about Millay's
war poetry, and also I missed an entire Pound session with Youngman
Kim which I didn't want to miss because of his character, I feel like
I missed a whole novel by Dickens.

There was Youngmin Kim, whom I gathered after observing him at a
cocktail party was the top poet of Korea, with many stories about
meeting this or that American poet and besting them at their own
game.  He was born in 1925 like many of the great American poets whom
he listed.  He said that on a visit to California in the mid-1960s he
had tracked down Gary Snyder at some Marin retreat and stumbling
through the grasses, he came across what he thought was a man and a
woman.  In fact the 'woman" was Snyder, Youngmin Kim had never seen
such long hair on a man.  "And years later, when he and I presided
over the Seoul Poetry Conference of 1999, we shared a merry laugh
over his womanhood."  I would listen to his stories with my mouth
open, not sure I was getting all of the wit.  He reminded me of the
poets of my youth, all of whom were braggarts, they just couldn't
help it.  Kim told me of his greatest accomplishment, writing the
epic poem "San Diego" I think it was called, while working as a youth
on a sampan from Hong Kong to Seoul.  The amazing this was that this
huge long poem, which rivals Hart Crane's "The Bridge" for beauty,
was written entirely in English, a language which Kim did not really
know at the time!

After lunch I went to see Panel 3C, "Robert Duncan and the Berkeley
Renaissance" in Neville Hall.  Kelly Holt gave a paper that explained
who Ernst Kantorowicz was and how his social and aesthetic policies
saw him in good stead, both in protesting Nazi race policies in the
early 30s, and in taking a moral stance against the McCarthyite
hysteria of postwar California regents.  Kantorowicz enters poetic
history by becoming the teacher of many of the poets in the Berkeley
Renaissance--Robert Duncan, Jack Spicer, Robin Blaser, and exposing
them to his own personal history, he had been a member of the
GeorgeKreis, the circle of intellectuals and Adonises that surrounded
the German poet Stefan George in the Modernist era.  The theory is
that Spicer and Duncan and Blaser formed their ideas about poetic
community in emulation of Kantorowicz' membership in the Georgekreis.
Until recently however I was never sure how much, exactly, Spicer
knew about Stefan George.  Why it wasn't until 1980 that I realized
his name was pronounced "Gayorga," and not our own humble "George"
like "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"  But anyway among the
treasures we found recently in the Bancroft Library was a translation
Spicer made of George's translation of Baudelaire's SPLEEN poem.  Oh,
the lineage, this was the kind of thing Allen Ginsberg always
enjoyed.  And also we found a questionnaire Spicer had answered
regarding his poetic influences that makes it pretty clear that he'd
been introduced to, and knocked on his ass by, the work of Stefan
George at around the age of 18 or 19.  So Kelly's paper took in a
little of all these aspects of Kantorowicz' importance.  Jeff
Hamilton's paper was also good, but I didn't understand all of it.  I
had never met Hamilton before nor even heard of him and yet he was
exactly the kind of guy I would like to take a class from.  He seemed
like he knew everything and knew how to explain it too.  Andrew
Mossin's paper on the homosexual impulses behind the "Venice Poem"
was, as I expected, perfectly pleasurable and filled with insight-so
much so that I wondered briefly if, during the time since I'd last
seen Andrew, he'd gone gay.  Then I remembered that nowadays any
straight man or woman can do the gay thing exquisitely and it doesn't
mean a thing about their real life sexual preference.  It's like
Scientology in reverse!

Jackson Mac Low and Anne Tardos were at dinner with us.  Tardos
wasn't reading herself, a pity for she has a coruscating, Tower of
Babel style I've never heard duplicated in any of her imitators.
Over dinner we decided who was for Nader and who wasn't, under the
cover of explaining to our Canadian colleague Miriam Nichols why
Nader was so idolized and despised at the same time.  Indeed the
atmosphere was all much more against Nader than against Bush.  At the
evening before, Creeley had apologized to Mac Low for having voted
for Nader the first time around under the influence of his son, but
this time he swore, he wouldn't.

"Did anyone see Vic?"

Vic?  No, I didn't place the reference.

It was "Vic" from Queer as Folk, the gay male soap on Showtime cable
channel which apparently Mac Low and Tardos watch faithfully.  "Vic"
is the uncle of one of the main characters and also thus Sharon
Gless's brother on the show, and just last Saturday Vic got killed
off on the show, so picture their shock when they were walking
through Neville Hall and bumped right into Vic face to face.  "We
were as close to him as I am to you!" they swore, and even though I
didn't know who he was, I still wanted to get his autograph, it's the
way I'm made.  "We asked him what he was doing at Orono and he said
he was going to be Robert Lowell!"

The big Saturday night event this year was to be a performance of a
play which had been made out of the Lowell-Bishop letters, a
two-person play.  I couldn't make up my mind if this sounded like a
good idea or a very, very camp idea.  I liked the name of the
playwright-Monique Fowler-who was also going to be playing Bishop
opposite the Robert Lowell of "Vic"-but the play had a title that
seemed determined to explain everything away before you even saw it.
"One Atlantic: From Bangor to Rio."  It barely made sense, and yet it
made too much sense.  As for "Vic," he is a Canadian actor who was
one of the late Timothy Findlay's favorites and who also recently
played Shakespeare in a new play called Swansong so perhaps Robert
Lowell wasn't much of a stretch.  Apparently Robert Lowell wrote that
insane poem, "Skunk Hour," just a few miles from where we sat gabbing
and eating, and apparently Elizabeth Bishop lived thousands of miles
away enjoying the permanent Carnaval society of Rio. although maybe
"enjoying" is the wrong word; still, one gets the idea that she's
have a few drinks at sunset and then write to Lowell about her
problems with that stern architect whom she loved so much.

Thus the conversation turned to the way high culture occasionally
leaks into mass culture.  Jennifer Moxley recalled the Fred and
Ginger film, Top Hat (1935), in which a telegram comes and Ginger's
dress designer reads it to her.  "Come ahead-stop-stop being a
sap-stop-you can even bring Alberto-stop-my husband is stopping at
your hotel-stop-when do you start-stop."  The dress designer frowns.
"I cannot understand who wrote this!" he cries.  Ginger snaps,
"Sounds like Gertrude Stein."  Anne Tardos recalled a Chabrol film in
which a detective presses a madeleine on a recalcitrant suspect,
saying "They're great for the memory."  I always thought that
Hitchcock's The 39 Steps was referencing Proust; if you recall, the
plot revolves around the search for the UK music-hall performer, "Mr.
Memory," who snaps into motion, spouting huge realms of data, when
confronted by the visage of the leading lady, Madeleine Carroll.
Coincidence?  I think not.

In the middle of the dinner Doug Rothschild turned up, having driven
all the way from Albany New York with Don Byrd.  Doug was staying at
Steve and Jennifer's house also, in the cutest room up in an old
fashioned attic, the kind of room you picture Fairfield Porter having
grown up in, splendid.  This was great for me as it was my chance to
spend a bit of time with Doug whom I met ten years or so or more but
have never gotten to see alone I don't think, and finally I realized
what people were saying was right, all these years, he is a prince of
a fellow.  He switched back and forth between these two beautiful
suits, one bright red like a cardinal, the other more of a
mulligatawny, he was the most elegant man in Maine outside of J.
Hillis Miller.

I had my one book that I got people to sign, it was an Advance
Reading Copy of the old Best American Poetry of 2002.  When I got it,
tattered and bumped up a little around the edges, it had already been
signed by four contributors, Anselm Berrigan, Duncan McNaughton,
Clark Coolidge, and Clayton Eshleman.  In San Francisco, I had run
down Joseph Lease and Peter Gizzi (while he was here visiting).  But
Orono was like a minefield of "Best American Poets," I started with
Creeley, the editor, and ran like Roger Bannister after the rest,
Jackson Mac Low and Jennifer Moxley to start out with.  I made a
little mental list of who to spot and when.  Some might think it
stupid, so I had to think of a reason to persuade them.  See, I was
imagining things in my head that never came true.  Soon that
blue-covered book was bulging with people's names.  Norman
Finkelstein, Phil Metres, Ben Friedlander, Ted Enslin, and more.
It's sitting here on my desk, my one souvenir I brought back with me.
I could put it on Ebay, or I could keep it whole.

The plenary speaker was J. Hillis Miller, who was introduced by
Cassandra Laity, a scholar whom I never got to meet during my whole
time at Orono, but who was instantly recognizable by her outfits
wherever she went.  They were distinctive as Olive Oyl's famous
wraparound skirts, but in a different way, one that's hard to
describe.  They were hat-centric I guess.  We were all trying to
figure out how old J. Hillis Miller might be.  He began his talk on
Williams and Stevens by reminiscing on the days when he used to go to
readings that they gave.  Now, when could that have been?  Miller,
one of the great US deconstructionists from Yale, apparently lives
not too far away from Orono and made this trip oh, for the hell of
it.  He pointed out that a conference filled with subject-centered
papers wasn't his usual purlieu and launched into his paper by
describing the unusual interest Stevens takes in the "indigene," the
native son, the character colorful because so long rooted.

I took Miller's picture and told him how much I enjoyed hearing him
speak about Stevens.  He gave me a frosty headmasterlike look and
said, "If you like hearing about Stevens, then the next step is to
read something he wrote.  He's in the library you know."  Then he
spelled Stevens' name, letter by letter, while I responded by closing
the lens cap mechanically wondering what I had done to unleash such
contempt.  "S," he said.  "T," he continued.  "E, V, E," the letters
poured on with only the lightest of pauses between them.  I pictured
an exchange in which I denied being that ignorant of Stevens' poetry.
I figured oh the hell with it.  Later I was to have a less fraught
encounter with J. Hillis Miller, one during which he un-bent enough
to tell what the "J" stands for in his name.

While I was still blushing, another plenary session was beginning.
This one sounded especially promising.  Alan Trachtenberg spoke on,
"The Noir Decade, Historical Perspectives of the 1940s."  Well, I
think maybe it might have been good for some kind of assembly of
really bright students, but Trachtenberg wound up saying nothing that
we didn't know already, about the historical conditions under which
the noir phenomenon was born.  Maybe it would make a good book, and
he was able to isolate one of my favorite films, Shadow of a Doubt,
as an early noir film, but in a way I was disappointed because I
wanted to hear more synthesis, or even less synthesis if only a good
reading of something.

Then at 9:30 another huge reading of the visiting scholars.  They
poured into this one, and I wanted to see my colleague Aaron Kunin
read from his poems, but I missed him and got in only when Jonathan
Skinner was reading.  I guess I was feeling talkative and wanted to
process, as we say here in San Francisco, all my emotions about all
the millions of things I had seen and done that day.  I cornered
Jennifer in the bar and I filled her in, her patient gaze never
wilting as I said this, that and the other thing and we commented on
how drunk everyone was getting, except for us.

One of the graduate students at U Maine called Brian Carpenter, gave
me a copy of his book, "Bluest Keys" (Daikusei Productions), a book
of poetry with an emblem of an old fossil on the front of it.  Or
maybe it's a sand dollar.  I found myself talking to Brian Carpenter
as though I had known him awhile, and then I realized what it was, he
is so similar in looks to another friend of mine who is also called
Brian, the Memphis novelist Brian Pera, even down to the way each
tilts his head when talking, a skeptical expression crossing their
faces, even down to the ears you could pick up their heads like
loving cups with handles, so to me it was like standing there talking
to the first Brian, I wonder if I came off as being a bit
over-familiar.  Maybe that happens to people as they get older,
everyone reminds me of someone I used to know, see, or lust over.

In any case Brian Carpenter is really his own self.  I wonder if he
might have been better off going to someplace like Temple that has a
larger urban presence, or maybe people just get into the Maine groove
after awhile and that seeps into one's writing.  What I see in
"Bluest Keys" is a restricted vocabulary that, like Evan Holloway's
sculptures of torqued but still "natural" tree branches, manages to
evade the claims of the natural and the artificial by being
forthright, wearing its heart on its sleeve.  "Era and age and O my
amour."  The length of its sentences signals that it's some kind of
homophonic transformation kind of piece.  I mean, they're all short,
a few words apiece.  If he keeps it up he will be going places, good
for him.

Another acquaintance from previous sessions of Orono Conference was
Andrew Epstein the poet and scholar who now lives in Florida.  The
good news is that he has finished his book on O'Hara (and Ashbery and
Baraka) and that b, Oxford University Press will publish it and c,
it's called by the flamboyant, Harlequin title "Beautiful Enemies,"
which, Andrew assures me, is actually a quote from Emerson.  Not
Emerson, Lake and Palmer; the real Emerson of the 19th Century.
Andrew is one of the best writers around and it was great to see him
once more.  And he is funny too.  I told him that due to my health
I've been taking so many prescriptions that I'm usually kind of happy
most of the time but that little arouses me "short of a handjob."  He
looked about us at the unusually dour faces of our compadres and
quipped, "Well, it's not going to be that kind of conference."  (Ha
ha, and yet for some it was indeed that kind of conference.)  Also on
hand were other O'Hara scholars whose books are about to appear or
have recently appeared: Michael Magee, whose book Emancipating
Pragmatism, also about O'Hara and Baraka and Emerson, came out on
April Fools Day, and Lytle Shaw of NYU, whose book on The Poetics of
Coterie Wisconsin will publish next year, which is not all that much
about Emerson.  And of course Maine is extremely lucky to have two
superb O'Hara scholars working there right on the faculty, Ben
Friedlander and Steve Evans both.  For me it was an exciting
opportunity to see these wise men once again and to ask them, for
example, what they thought of the authenticity of the "new" O'Hara
play that Olivier Brossard found among the Bunny Lang papers and then
published in The Yale Review.  Andrew reminded me (when we spoke of
the upcoming event with "Vic" from Queer as Folk as Robert Lowell) of
a previous encounter with celebrity on the campus of U-Maine Orono.
It was the time that "Becky" from Roseanne came and I guess Andrew
actually broke the ice and spoke to her, asking her why?  Why was she
there?  And Becky reported that she was thinking of becoming a poet
and that someone had told her there were a lot of poets at the Orono
Conference.  It must have been nice for her not to be pestered by
fans for a week, but maybe not that nice because she never did become
a poet and returned to acting instead.  "Oh," he said, "did you see
your review in Rain Taxi?"  "No!  What is it of?"  I couldn't
remember having written anything that Rain Taxi might ever review.
"I don't know it's some play you wrote."  Instantly it came to me--it
must be Island of Lost Souls, that I wrote way back when, and which
Meredith and Peter Quartermain recently printed in their Nomados
Series.  I had forgotten all about it.  Anxiously I said, "Well, was
it a favorable review?"  "Very favorable."  "Who wrote the review?"
Andrew said he didn't recognize the name, then adding, that he'd
brought the magazine on the plane with him and he had it up in his
room and that he'd bring me the review in the morning.  Hooray!  On
the other hand I was thinking, gee, which of my friends reviewed that
book?  I couldn't imagine anyone who didn't know me doing such a
favor.  Well, I have been reviewed by strangers in the past, but they
always seem to carve me up and leave me in pieces.  So this was going
to be a switch.  Rain Taxi is the magazine you never see, but when
you do, you see heaping piles of it, like Steve Wolfe sculptures, and
they're always for free.  I don't understand the economy of it, but
I'm from San Francisco where everything costs the earth and one just
learns to do without.

Finally the best part, sitting around afterwards, at 3 or 4 in the
morning, around the kitchen table at Steve and Jennifer's house,
conducting a post mortem of what had occurred, who had worn what, and
why poetry would or wouldn't forever be changed in the days ahead of
us.  Cartographer of all my days, let me see that part again, go back
to that one part around the table.  That was the cool part.

Friday, June 25, 2004

I stayed out so late that I missed the first panel entirely.  8:30
was too early for me I guess.  Doug and I made it to the campus only
just in time to see the reading that had been hurriedly moved to an
early morning slot to fill up the absence of Harryette Mullen.  La
Mullen had planned to take a Greyhound bus from Los Angeles to Maine,
but missed it.  Wow, that's a long trip to come all the way on a bus
to give a reading at 9:45 on a Friday morning!  In her place we heard
instead four pretty impressive guys, Bill Howe, Kasey Mohammad, Bob
Perelman, and Lytle Shaw.   Now that I look back it's a shame I
missed so many good panels that morning.  I particularly wanted to go
to the Lorine Niedecker panel and ask Jayne Marek what "anent" means
as in the title of her paper, "'Bird-Witted on Black Hawk Island': A
Poetics of Animals anent Lorine Niedecker and Marianne Moore."  Well,
closer to home I can ask Carol Snow I suppose, the SF poet who has
just come out with a new book with the Zukofskyan title of The
Seventy Prepositions and she has a poem for every one, so there's
bound to be an "Anent " poem, or at least definition (depending on
whether or not "anent" really is a proposition).  And, the Gwendolyn
Brooks panel looked good too.  And also the Eliot panel I could have
heard about Olaf Stapledon

Margaret Avison went everywhere with this other older woman, who was
tall, stood with exquisite posture, and pure white hair all dolled up
into a beehive or a sugary white, I think her name was June.
Apparently June is another resident at the old folks home that Avison
lives at, and came along to help see to her.  Some speculated that
the two women were lovers, which would have made a nice image, but I
don't know, I'm skeptical.  Maybe in San Francisco it's easy to spot,
but outside of the big coastal cities all women dress like Lesbians.
It's just their way.  Besides, Avison is such a Christian I can't
picture her countenancing something that Jahweh might have forbidden
in the Old Testament.  You'd have to read Avison's poetry to
understand my conviction.  After reading "The Dumbfounding" on the
plane I put it aside, thinking, "Wow, she's more religious than Mel
Gibson!"  I try to juggle my disapproval of fundamentalist politics
and my admiration of Avison's effects

Creeley sank into a seat next to Avison, and a press photographer
ambled over to take a few dozen candid shots of the two of them as
they sat there, jawing.  They are now the remaining survivors of the
famous 1963 Vancouver Poetry Festival, having outlived Philip Whalen,
Warren Tallman, Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov, Charles Olson, etc.
I wonder what it must feel like to be the last two alive.  She wore a
beige blouse with a Peter Pan collar, and over it a extraordinary
cowl-neck sweater of horizontal stripes of peach, red, white, olive,
beige, blue, and black.  I will see that sweater in my dreams!  She
carries a cane covered in some electric blue material like bicyclists
tag onto their bikes to prevent being run over.

Michelle:

I understand your frustration. I think it's because you expect something
from a poem that you're not getting here. Remember Balzac's extraordinary
story, "The Unknown Masterpiece," which has since influenced so many
artists? What do we do when an artist gives us something that we're not
ready to process? The critics in Balzac's story would have to wait until
painting had evolved to a point where abstraction was possible, before they
could understand what they were seeing. They had to wait for Cézanne.

What I'm saying is that it's impossible to judge work such as Alan
Sondheim's in the ordinary way. He may be ahead of his time, or he may be
irrelevant to the future. We have no way of knowing which will be true. But
how many of us have the guts to take such a risk?! Like with painting, along
with Alan's experimentations digital poetry must also evolve within more
traditional frames. We must have our Cézanne.

Subject: What I Saw at the Orono Conference 2004, part 4

The plenary speaker was J. Hillis Miller, who was introduced by
Cassandra Laity, a scholar whom I never got to meet during my whole
time at Orono, but who was instantly recognizable by her outfits
wherever she went.  They were distinctive as Olive Oyl's famous
wraparound skirts, but in a different way, one that's hard to
describe.  They were hat-centric I guess.  We were all trying to
figure out how old J. Hillis Miller might be.  He began his talk on
Williams and Stevens by reminiscing on the days when he used to go to
readings that they gave.  Now, when could that have been?  Miller,
one of the great US deconstructionists from Yale, apparently lives
not too far away from Orono and made this trip oh, for the hell of
it.  He pointed out that a conference filled with subject-centered
papers wasn't his usual purlieu and launched into his paper by
describing the unusual interest Stevens takes in the "indigene," the
native son, the character colorful because so long rooted.

I took Miller's picture and told him how much I enjoyed hearing him
speak about Stevens.  He gave me a frosty headmasterlike look and
said, "If you like hearing about Stevens, then the next step is to
read something he wrote.  He's in the library you know."  Then he
spelled Stevens' name, letter by letter, while I responded by closing
the lens cap mechanically wondering what I had done to unleash such
contempt.  "S," he said.  "T," he continued.  "E, V, E," the letters
poured on with only the lightest of pauses between them.  I pictured
an exchange in which I denied being that ignorant of Stevens' poetry.
I figured oh the hell with it.  Later I was to have a less fraught
encounter with J. Hillis Miller, one during which he un-bent enough
to tell what the "J" stands for in his name.

While I was still blushing, another plenary session was beginning.
This one sounded especially promising.  Alan Trachtenberg spoke on,
"The Noir Decade, Historical Perspectives of the 1940s."  Well, I
think maybe it might have been good for some kind of assembly of
really bright students, but Trachtenberg wound up saying nothing that
we didn't know already, about the historical conditions under which
the noir phenomenon was born.  Maybe it would make a good book, and
he was able to isolate one of my favorite films, Shadow of a Doubt,
as an early noir film, but in a way I was disappointed because I
wanted to hear more synthesis, or even less synthesis if only a good
reading of something.

Then at 9:30 another huge reading of the visiting scholars.  They
poured into this one, and I wanted to see my colleague Aaron Kunin
read from his poems, but I missed him and got in only when Jonathan
Skinner was reading.  I guess I was feeling talkative and wanted to
process, as we say here in San Francisco, all my emotions about all
the millions of things I had seen and done that day.  I cornered
Jennifer in the bar and I filled her in, her patient gaze never
wilting as I said this, that and the other thing and we commented on
how drunk everyone was getting, except for us.

One of the graduate students at U Maine called Brian Carpenter, gave
me a copy of his book, "Bluest Keys" (Daikusei Productions), a book
of poetry with an emblem of an old fossil on the front of it.  Or
maybe it's a sand dollar.  I found myself talking to Brian Carpenter
as though I had known him awhile, and then I realized what it was, he
is so similar in looks to another friend of mine who is also called
Brian, the Memphis novelist Brian Pera, even down to the way each
tilts his head when talking, a skeptical expression crossing their
faces, even down to the ears you could pick up their heads like
loving cups with handles, so to me it was like standing there talking
to the first Brian, I wonder if I came off as being a bit
over-familiar.  Maybe that happens to people as they get older,
everyone reminds me of someone I used to know, see, or lust over.

In any case Brian Carpenter is really his own self.  I wonder if he
might have been better off going to someplace like Temple that has a
larger urban presence, or maybe people just get into the Maine groove
after awhile and that seeps into one's writing.  What I see in
"Bluest Keys" is a restricted vocabulary that, like Evan Holloway's
sculptures of torqued but still "natural" tree branches, manages to
evade the claims of the natural and the artificial by being
forthright, wearing its heart on its sleeve.  "Era and age and O my
amour."  The length of its sentences signals that it's some kind of
homophonic transformation kind of piece.  I mean, they're all short,
a few words apiece.  If he keeps it up he will be going places, good
for him.

Another acquaintance from previous sessions of Orono Conference was
Andrew Epstein the poet and scholar who now lives in Florida.  The
good news is that he has finished his book on O'Hara (and Ashbery and
Baraka) and that b, Oxford University Press will publish it and c,
it's called by the flamboyant, Harlequin title "Beautiful Enemies,"
which, Andrew assures me, is actually a quote from Emerson.  Not
Emerson, Lake and Palmer; the real Emerson of the 19th Century.
Andrew is one of the best writers around and it was great to see him
once more.  And he is funny too.  I told him that due to my health
I've been taking so many prescriptions that I'm usually kind of happy
most of the time but that little arouses me "short of a handjob."  He
looked about us at the unusually dour faces of our compadres and
quipped, "Well, it's not going to be that kind of conference."  (Ha
ha, and yet for some it was indeed that kind of conference.)  Also on
hand were other O'Hara scholars whose books are about to appear or
have recently appeared: Michael Magee, whose book Emancipating
Pragmatism, also about O'Hara and Baraka and Emerson, came out on
April Fools Day, and Lytle Shaw of NYU, whose book on The Poetics of
Coterie Wisconsin will publish next year, which is not all that much
about Emerson.  And of course Maine is extremely lucky to have two
superb O'Hara scholars working there right on the faculty, Ben
Friedlander and Steve Evans both.  For me it was an exciting
opportunity to see these wise men once again and to ask them, for
example, what they thought of the authenticity of the "new" O'Hara
play that Olivier Brossard found among the Bunny Lang papers and then
published in The Yale Review.  Andrew reminded me (when we spoke of
the upcoming event with "Vic" from Queer as Folk as Robert Lowell) of
a previous encounter with celebrity on the campus of U-Maine Orono.
It was the time that "Becky" from Roseanne came and I guess Andrew
actually broke the ice and spoke to her, asking her why?  Why was she
there?  And Becky reported that she was thinking of becoming a poet
and that someone had told her there were a lot of poets at the Orono
Conference.  It must have been nice for her not to be pestered by
fans for a week, but maybe not that nice because she never did become
a poet and returned to acting instead.  "Oh," he said, "did you see
your review in Rain Taxi?"  "No!  What is it of?"  I couldn't
remember having written anything that Rain Taxi might ever review.
"I don't know it's some play you wrote."  Instantly it came to me--it
must be Island of Lost Souls, that I wrote way back when, and which
Meredith and Peter Quartermain recently printed in their Nomados
Series.  I had forgotten all about it.  Anxiously I said, "Well, was
it a favorable review?"  "Very favorable."  "Who wrote the review?"
Andrew said he didn't recognize the name, then adding, that he'd
brought the magazine on the plane with him and he had it up in his
room and that he'd bring me the review in the morning.  Hooray!  On
the other hand I was thinking, gee, which of my friends reviewed that
book?  I couldn't imagine anyone who didn't know me doing such a
favor.  Well, I have been reviewed by strangers in the past, but they
always seem to carve me up and leave me in pieces.  So this was going
to be a switch.  Rain Taxi is the magazine you never see, but when
you do, you see heaping piles of it, like Steve Wolfe sculptures, and
they're always for free.  I don't understand the economy of it, but
I'm from San Francisco where everything costs the earth and one just
learns to do without.

Finally the best part, sitting around afterwards, at 3 or 4 in the
morning, around the kitchen table at Steve and Jennifer's house,
conducting a post mortem of what had occurred, who had worn what, and
why poetry would or wouldn't forever be changed in the days ahead of
us.  Cartographer of all my days, let me see that part again, go back
to that one part around the table.  That was the cool part.

Friday, June 25, 2004

I stayed out so late that I missed the first panel entirely.  8:30
was too early for me I guess.  Doug and I made it to the campus only
just in time to see the reading that had been hurriedly moved to an
early morning slot to fill up the absence of Harryette Mullen.  La
Mullen had planned to take a Greyhound bus from Los Angeles to Maine,
but missed it.  Wow, that's a long trip to come all the way on a bus
to give a reading at 9:45 on a Friday morning!  In her place we heard
instead four pretty impressive guys, Bill Howe, Kasey Mohammad, Bob
Perelman, and Lytle Shaw.   Now that I look back it's a shame I
missed so many good panels that morning.  I particularly wanted to go
to the Lorine Niedecker panel and ask Jayne Marek what "anent" means
as in the title of her paper, "'Bird-Witted on Black Hawk Island': A
Poetics of Animals anent Lorine Niedecker and Marianne Moore."  Well,
closer to home I can ask Carol Snow I suppose, the SF poet who has
just come out with a new book with the Zukofskyan title of The
Seventy Prepositions and she has a poem for every one, so there's
bound to be an "Anent " poem, or at least definition (depending on
whether or not "anent" really is a proposition).  And, the Gwendolyn
Brooks panel looked good too.  And also the Eliot panel I could have
heard about Olaf Stapledon

Margaret Avison went everywhere with this other older woman, who was
tall, stood with exquisite posture, and pure white hair all dolled up
into a beehive or a sugary white, I think her name was June.
Apparently June is another resident at the old folks home that Avison
lives at, and came along to help see to her.  Some speculated that
the two women were lovers, which would have made a nice image, but I
don't know, I'm skeptical.  Maybe in San Francisco it's easy to spot,
but outside of the big coastal cities all women dress like Lesbians.
It's just their way.  Besides, Avison is such a Christian I can't
picture her countenancing something that Jahweh might have forbidden
in the Old Testament.  You'd have to read Avison's poetry to
understand my conviction.  After reading "The Dumbfounding" on the
plane I put it aside, thinking, "Wow, she's more religious than Mel
Gibson!"  I try to juggle my disapproval of fundamentalist politics
and my admiration of Avison's effects

Creeley sank into a seat next to Avison, and a press photographer
ambled over to take a few dozen candid shots of the two of them as
they sat there, jawing.  They are now the remaining survivors of the
famous 1963 Vancouver Poetry Festival, having outlived Philip Whalen,
Warren Tallman, Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov, Charles Olson, etc.
I wonder what it must feel like to be the last two alive.  She wore a
beige blouse with a Peter Pan collar, and over it a extraordinary
cowl-neck sweater of horizontal stripes of peach, red, white, olive,
beige, blue, and black.  I will see that sweater in my dreams!  She
carries a cane covered in some electric blue material like bicyclists
tag onto their bikes to prevent being run over.

Sounds like the J. Hillis Miller I knew as an undergrad at Hopkins, where
all Lit profs were gods, and don't you forget it.

There were very few of them--a small department--and although I never took
a course from Miller (I made at the time what I still think was a wise
decision not to take any American or modern poetry courses--I didn't want
those guys fucking with my own processing of what as a poet I felt was more
my turf than theirs) I did know him (to the extent that mortals were
allowed to know professors).

In the late winter or early spring of 1965 one of the MFA candidates (name
escapes me at the moment) managed to get Creeley invited to read. In the
Hopkins MFA program Eliot was still top dog, so it was a real
accomplishment. Miller, as the modernist, introduced Creeley. The practice
at Hopkins was to overwhelm visiting speakers with one's erudition or to
scorn them into submission. I saw Charles Singleton lead the pack when
Isaiah Berlin came to speak about Dante--Berlin was too smart a fox for
them, and they drew no blood. And I saw Marshall MacLuhan, regarded as the
antichrist, pirouette repeatedly out of harm's way--how do you lay a fist
on a guy whose talk consists almost entirely of shaggy dog stories?

Others weren't so agile or lucky.

Miller spoke for something like a half hour about the influence of Stevens
on Creeley, speaking more about Stevens than Creeley, whom he'd apparently
never read before. Bob was visibly annoyed. He gave a counter-introduction,
beginning with something like "Stevens has had no influence on my work,"
and continuing on about his profound affinity with Williams.

Seems strange--Miller must have already written about Williams in Poets of
Reality, which was about to appear.

Oh Roger, this is sad. I have noticed, over the years, what a nice guy you
are, but I am not looking for sympathy, I simply can't raise any of these
issues on brit-based fora because I've become effectively gagged on them by
people from overseas, for the most part. I am not nationalistic, am devoid
of racism, have impeccable left-wing credentials, but find myself getting
caricatured as some kind of mad nationalist by members of the literary
bourgeoisie. To talk in the English style, I am seriously  pissed off by
this. Various people can do predictable double acts to screw me up, but that
it seems is ok,  bollocks can be put out as representing left-wing views
(it's ok, they mean nothing, say the powers that be)  and in the meantime
....

well I dunno, there's this sort of space!

btw a lot of the boring writers in A Chide's Alphabet are on this list so
maybe you could tell them how dull they are.

To be clear about my part. I suggested that you should raise these issues
in a British forum because there, in all possibility, you would at least
get some sympathy.  And, lo and behold, it's as I predicted: all you've
gained so far is some well deserved opprobrium, modulo the invisible
back-channelers of course. In fact, Alan seems to be strenghthened by the
renewed interest you've stirred - and may the force be with him, I say. You
seem to have acted as a marketing agent for Alan - very generous of you, if
I may say so. Sadly, it has left me with the feeling that someone who I had
hitherto respected, seems to have come up with a streak of wooliness.
Although, with a few exceptions, I never wholly liked  the content of
chides whatsits, it seemed a worthy endeavour and well produced.

As to the Brit forums, well, what can I say. You seem to have laden
yourself with a passle of hassle, if I may say so. But, really, I couldn't
give two hoots. However, I also suggested that you complain directly to
tRace but they wouldn't, in all probability, give you a hearing either. I
wouldn't really blame them either, given that you go around dissing them in
public. Barring the Daily Mail - have you tried writing to them? - there
is, I suppose, another way: tRace's funders, who are, in all likelihood,
the English Arts Council, but you'd have to do some legwork to ascertain
this. At a guess, tRace's funders  might - if you presented a substantial
case - give you a decent hearing. But hey, this is what *I* would do if I
wanted to do something about it.

But, as Robin says,  enough already. This wearied me the first time round.
Now it's just boring.

Roger.

Hi Rob

isn't this all complicated!? My suspicion is that most of these matters
arise from mistake, not deliberate venom, although sometimes one cannot be
quite sure. Roger Day, quite innocently I am sure, suggested that I should
raise these matters about arts funding in our local region on a certain
British based list, while Rebecca Seifeirle followed up with remarks about
my posts being screened there, whereas the truth of the matter is, although
my posts are under review, for reasons that are not quite explicable, as
you
know, nothing I post to that list, of +any+ nature, will appear as both
list
owners seem to have gone into absentia so I might as well be talking into a
black hole. It sort of undermines the logic of review status if nobody's
reviewing the posts. This kind of death by silence is what seems to
characterise the UK arts scene but one is never quite sure whether the
murders are deliberate or not. But, I can say with certainty, that only a
small number of people have access to the 'pot' here, one sees the same
names crop up again and again, they are not necessarily the best writers in
the region, I can think of many gifted people who are completely shut out,
but they, the ever recurring names that is,  are the most adept are
manipulating funding. Alan's unfortunate remarks about Incubation were so
way off the mark - of course I don't have hard copies of the mag - but also
Incubation costs a fortune to attend - a little fact that Alan omits to
mention.
I've long gone past being angry about all this stuff, just miserably
resigned to reality.

From here among the what one must not mention

Best

There have been three issues of A Chide's Alphabet, all originally virtual
and only Chide1 is available in hardcopy.

(Anyone who wants a (hard)copy of Chide1 backchannel me -- I've got plenty.

It's not dave's fault that Chides 2 and 3 never made hardcopy -- entirely
due to my incompetance.)

There's a problem-of-communication when it comes to discussing the
structural funding of poetry in USAmerica and Britain (and even that needs
to be unteased, given that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
{add in Eire} differ quite considerably.  Leave aside Canada, Australia and
New Zealand, to mention only a few).

The name of the game in the US is MFA -- simply doesn't exist here, or not
enough to make a living from.

Early on, I decided that there were only two ways to play the funding
game -- you did it seriously, and I admire the ones who can do this.

... or you took no money from ANYONE.

I'm not sure at what point it became feasible to print your own book or
magazine, run a publishing house on peanuts.

Maybe about five years ago when technology encountered the fading rose, and
all you had to do was lash together a laser printer, a copy of Word, and a
Dahle 515 guillotine.

A tube of PVA glue and a blunt knife to score the covers.

The only complicated bit I found with this was working-out the algorithm
for
paginating in Word if you were doing double-sided printing.

So, OK, i confess to a bit of special interest here -- I don't like TrAce,
which always struck me, though I'm assuredly biased, as a pack of wittering
third-rate Nottingham-Trent academics playing ego games.

And I've published a fair bit in _The Coffee House_, which does get money
from EMA.

So when it comes to the East Midlands debacle, I'm probably the absolute
pig-in-the-middle.

Enough, already.

Robin, you took Alan Sondheim to task for not knowing that Chide's Alphabet
is virtual and yet you *locate Trace Online Community as a Nottingham Trent
phenomenon

How am I to characterise someone who characterises others as wittering and
third-rate whilst also saying that in doing so he is being "assuredly
biased"

Not "I might be biased", but "[I am] assuredly biased"

What then is the point of saying it?

All the best

in any case it would seem that he is compiling a
textfile into an executable object...which is after
all ultimately one thing we all hope poetry does...it
should become an object capable of execution; it
should change one in some way, act on the reader...

now, as to code poems in general, think of it this
way:::::should a poet be interested in language at
all? should a poet study linguistics? and what would
be the difference between a poet immersed in
linguistics and a poet immersed in bytes? and if print
poets are interested in meter, why can't digital poets
be interested in TCP/IP?

Lawrence:

Surely trAce *is* located at Nottingham Trent? -- it's sure as hell what
their URL says.

(I think you're right in that it didn't start, years ago, as "a Nottingham
Trent phenomonon", but it's certainly, for some time, been closely
associated with it.)

As I understand it, much of the financial support -- correct me if I'm
wrong -- comes from EMA, but some support, certainly computer space and, I
think, technical assistance, is provided by N-T University.

Their address is:

trAce Online Writing Centre
The Nottingham Trent University, Clifton Lane, Clifton,
Nottingham NG11 8NS, England

http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/about/index.cfm

Briefly, here are snatches of biographical information on the first three
officers given on the trAce staff-page:

Staff

Sue Thomas is the founder and Artistic Director of trAce.  <snip>  In 1994
she developed the MA in Writing at The Nottingham Trent University and
during that time she also wrote A Handbook for Creative Writing Tutors.

Helen Whitehead  <snip> holds an MA in Writing from The Nottingham Trent
University, where she specialised in hypertext fiction on the Web

Simon Mills  <snip> has an MA in Writing and MSc in Multimedia from The
Nottingham Trent University.

[Fuller details via the URL above, in case anyone thinks I'm unjustifiably
selecting out-of-context.]

***

I suppose I could go on and work my way down the entire staff-list, but I
think that's *quite* enough to prove my point about the link between trAce
and Nottingham Trent.

[Actually, and I only bothered to go to the trouble of chasing this down
*after* you pulled me up, rather than working from my flawed memory and
(mis?)perceptions, that makes the link CLOSER than I'd thought, so thank-you
for helping me tighten-up my argument. <g>]

I suppose to describe them as "wittering" constituted, as you pointed out,
an unjustified and gratuitous slur on my part, but I still stand behind my
contention of the trAce/N-T link.

Subject:      on Kerry
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

The Kerry Mandate: Strong and Wrong
by Jonathan Schell

"During the Vietnam War, many young men, including the current President,
the Vice President and me, could have gone to Vietnam and didn't. John
Kerry came from a privileged background. He could have avoided going, too.
But instead he said, 'Send me.'

"When they sent those Swift Boats up the river in Vietnam... John Kerry
said, 'Send me.'

"And then when America needed to extricate itself from that misbegotten
and disastrous war, Kerry donned his uniform once again, and said, 'Send
me'; and he led veterans to an encampment on the Washington Mall, where,
in defiance of the Nixon Justice Department, they conducted the most
stirring and effective of the protests, that forced an end to the war.

"And then, on my watch, when it was time to heal the wounds of war and
normalize relations with Vietnam...John Kerry said, 'Send me.'"

So spoke President Clinton at the Democratic Convention--except that he
did not deliver the third paragraph about Kerry's protest; I made that up.
The speech cries out for the inclusion of Kerry's glorious moment of
antiwar leadership; and its absence is as palpable as one of those
erasures from photographs of high Soviet officials after Stalin had sent
them to the gulag. Clinton's message was plain.

Military courage in war is honored; civil courage in opposing a disastrous
war is not honored. Even thirty years later, it cannot be mentioned by a
former President who himself opposed the Vietnam War. The political rule,
as Clinton once put it in one of the few pithy things he has ever said,
"We [Democrats] have got to be strong.... When people feel uncertain,
they'd rather have somebody who's strong and wrong than somebody who's
weak and right."

And now the United States is engaged in a war fully as wrong as the one in
Vietnam. The boiling core of American politics today is the war in Iraq
and all its horrors: the continuing air strikes on populated cities; the
dogs loosed by American guards on naked, bound Iraqi prisoners; the
kidnappings and the beheadings; the American casualties nearing a
thousand; the 10,000 or more Iraqi casualties; the occupation hidden
behind the mask of an entirely fictitious Iraqi "sovereignty"; the growing
scrapheap of discredited justifications for the war. But little of that is
mentioned these days by the Democrats. The great majority of Democratic
voters, according to polls, ardently oppose the war, yet by embracing the
candidacy of John Kerry, who voted for the Congressional resolution
authorizing the war and now wants to increase the number of American
troops in Iraq, the party has made what appears to be a tactical decision
to hide its faith.

The strong and wrong position won out in the Democratic Party when its
voters chose Kerry over Howard Dean in the Iowa caucuses and the New
Hampshire primary. An antiwar party rallied around a prowar candidate. The
result has been one of the most peculiar political atmospheres within a
party in recent memory. The Democrats are united but have concealed the
cause that unites them. The party champions free speech that it does not
practice. As a Dennis Kucinich delegate at the convention said to Amy
Goodman on Democracy Now!, "Peace" is "off-message." A haze of vagueness
and generality hangs over party pronouncements. In his convention speech,
President Carter, who is on record opposing the war, spoke against
"pre-emptive war" but did not specify which pre-emptive war he had in
mind. Al Gore, who has been wonderfully eloquent in his opposition to the
war, was tame for the occasion. "Regardless of your opinion at the
beginning of this war," he said, "isn't it now abundantly obvious that the
way this war has been managed by the Administration has gotten us into
very serious trouble?"

What of the antiwar sentiment that is still in truth at the heart of most
Democrats' anger? It has been displaced downward and outward, into the
outlying precincts of American politics. The political class as a whole
has proved incapable of taking responsibility for the future of the
nation, and the education of the American public has been left to those
without hope of office. Like a balloon that squeezed at the top expands at
the base, opposition to the war increases the farther you get from John
Kerry. Carter and Gore can express a little more of it. Howard Dean, who
infused the party with its now-muffled antiwar passion, can express more
still. Representative Kucinich, a full-throated peace candidate, has
endorsed Kerry and has kind words to say about him but holds fast to his
antiwar position. On the Internet, Tomdispatch.com, AlterNet.org,
CommonDreams.org, antiwar.com, MoveOn.org and many others are buzzing and
bubbling with honest and inspired reporting and commentary. Michael Moore
is packing audiences into 2,000 theaters to see Fahrenheit 9/11.

I know, I know: It's essential to remove George W. Bush from the White
House, and Kerry is the instrument at hand. I fully share this sentiment.
But I am not running for anything, and my job is not to carry water for
any party but to stand as far apart from the magnetic field of power as I
can and tell the truth as I see it. And it's not too early to worry about
the dangers posed by the Democrats' strategy. In the first place, they
have staked their future and the country's on a political calculation, but
it may be wrong. By suffocating their own passion, they may lose the
energy that has brought them this far. They have confronted Bush's policy
of denial with a politics of avoidance. Bush is adamant in error; they are
feeble in dedication to truth. If strong and wrong is really the winning
formula, Bush may be the public's choice. In the second place, if Kerry
does win, he will inherit the war wedded to a potentially disastrous
strategy. If he tries to change course, Republicans -- and hawkish
Democrats (Senator Joe Lieberman has just joined in a revival of the
Committee on the Present Danger) -- will not fail to remind him of his
commitment to stay the course and renew the charge of flip-flopping. But
the course, as retired Gen. Anthony Zinni has commented, may take the
country over Niagara Falls. Then Kerry may wish that he and his admirers
at this year's convention had thought to place a higher value on his
service to his country when he opposed the Vietnam War.

What does "the narcissistic voice of ego-driven consumer" mean? Are eating,
going to the movies ego-driven acts. No wonder you are using "narcissistic" in
such loose way?

Aha! We have a word for it: xenophobia. I must admit Americans suffer from
nauseating dollops of xenophobia. But your East Midlands centered version has
nothing to be ashamed it; it is as virulent.

This Poetics List, I assume, is supported by the Univercity of Buffalo, an
American institution. Does that mean that someone who is excluded from this list
(for instance, Kent Johnson) can write you a letter and complain why you as
an East Midlandarian are making use of Amerikan Buffalo resources?

Robin,

I go back to what you said.=20

QUOTE
So, OK, i confess to a bit of special interest here -- I don't like =

UNQUOTE

So, in your biased view then, Trace is  Nottingham-Trent academics. No =
one else is mentioned.=20

You didn't say, as you now do, "closely associated" but an implicit =
"is". You didn't say, as you now do, "link". The attempt is apparently =
to suggest a small group of people in one place, a bit bigger than a =
couple of grumpy guys in Leicester, I suppose, but not much. That's what =
you'd have us believe: that Trace is only something that goes on in =
Nottingham Trent. And perhaps there is some snobbery there in that =
dismissiveness and your judgement of third-rateness? It's ill-founded if =
there is.

Computer space and technical assistance are surely something else than =
the process they support and you slur - unless you judge the computers =
and the support third-rate too.

The *point about Trace being online - which knowing you for a bright lad =
I rather thought you would understand - is that it involves people from =
around the world. (You're not actually in SUNY Buffalo, are you? No more =
am I.) The website is there, physically, probably! but what is that to =
do with anything? A lot of the effort goes on elsewhere; and not, as you =
suggest, in a small geographical location. Many of the people do not =
work for or study at Nottingham Trent.

If you think you have tightened up an argument, enjoy the feeling. I am =
strongly inclined to disagree with you over both the tightening and the =
status of the argument. Tightening up an argument to me means having =
some evidence to show for your judgement.

I hope you're otherwise well.=20

All the best

Oh <sigh> I should get-out of the habit of footnoting my own emails, but I'm

My question to the entire list... what happens when you (know) that someone
is changing your emails? Furthermore, only one of my posts in the past week
has been rejected (gee I wonder which?). Oh, maybe it was the one where I
talked about what I believe instead of trying to *battle* a poet who I
respect. Dumb@*!!'s. If anyone wants to discuss anything in person you can
come to my current residence in Fayetteville, North Carolina, 500 Cape Fear.
I just left college (because it is brainwashing) & I am now working on my
first book. If you want, please kick me off the poetics list. Oh, and what
was I researching before I left the University, opaque learning, which by
the way is impossible in the University. So who are the hypocrites and who
are the fuzz? Thanks,
Ian
PS. Did you know that Southern Baptists count numbers as if they were signs

[Margaret Avison]

At the end a standing ovation.  Now as I come to write this down, I
wonder what made Avison's reading so extraordinary.  I asked a few
Canadians if they were familiar with her reading style, thinking
perhaps she was one whom every Canadian has seen, the way we have all
seen, oh, I don't know, Leslie Scalapino.  But no.  At least I asked
Louis Cabri and Miriam Nichols and neither of them had ever laid eyes
on her.  Apparently she's not on the circuit the way some other poets
are.  She's not really into "career" that much.  I don't think you
have to be "into career" to like to give readings per se, but
apparently Avison spends all of her time in soup kitchens ladling out
food to the homeless of Toronto and environs.  That's what she'd
rather do.  So partly it was this myth about her being "too good to
read" so we felt lucky, privileged to have seen her.  About three
weeks later, back home in San Francisco, Dodie, Glen and I went to
see Jane Russell at the Castro Theater.  She came on to discuss her
career and to introduce a new print of Howard Hawks' Gentlemen Prefer
Blondes, but she surprised us by getting up and doing a big chunk of
her nightclub act, singing Frank Loesser's "Buttons and Bows," and
"Bye Bye Baby," the great Jule Styne-Leo Robin number from 1949 she
sings with Marilyn Monroe in the movie:

Although I know that you care,
Won't you write and declare
That though on the loose,
You are still on the square.

I'll be gloomy,
But send that rainbow to me,
Then my shadows will fly.
Though you'll be gone for a while,
I know that I'll be smiling with my baby,
        by and by.

In addition, Russell launched into a piece of "special material"
written for her by Peggy Lee (!!!).  "This is to the tune of Big Bad
John, but it's called," she paused, "Big Bad Jane."  The crowd was
screaming in delight.  I whispered to Dodie, "This is what Margaret
Avison was like."  The two women, born in the same year, are both
avid Christians, and although now in their mid-eighties, they share a
tremendous vitality, a passion for living, as well as a predilection
for that electric blue, which was woven in and out of Russell's hair
as well as her blouse.  Each by herself was enough to make a grown
man cry.

After her reading Avison sank into one of the auditorium seats and a
little girl rushed over to her with a summer bouquet.  They made a
piquant contrast of youth and age, like a Victorian problem picture.
The little girl's mother took a few photos of her daughter and the
elderly poet.  She, the mother, had written a paper on Avison.
Avison wrote in my book, "High school Kevin."  That was flattering,
oh, but who knows what she was getting at, I suppose it could have
been a cut of some kind.  But anyhow I called Dodie up on the cell
phone and told her, that for me, the whole conference came together
once Margaret Avison got up to the part where she goes into a hotel
and there's a big mural of a horse above the desk.

I think this must have been the day that, for lunch, Doug Rothschild
and I went to the cafeteria on campus and somehow, through some
grotesque parody of scholarly fraternity, I wound up sitting next to
J. Hillis Miller.  He didn't seem to remember our horrid encounter of
the day before.  Good.  Instead he told us about going to visit
China.  The last time he was in China, the University he was visiting
gave him a diploma, but it was in Chinese and he couldn't remember
afterwards which university it had been because the whole diploma was
in Chinese.  I said, maybe he could distinguish it from the other
honorary doctorates he'd received because surely it was the only
Chinese one.  But he disagreed,  He is immensely popular in
China-like Wham!  He's been there 6 or 7 times and has received over
40 honorary degrees.  But (he said modestly) that's nothing compared
to the way the Chinese worship Frederic Jameson, as if he were a God.
At one banquet there was a big bas-relief of Mao and one of Jameson
and they all ate underneath these two big red faces.  "And you know
Fred doesn't miss a trick," he added.

I told J. Hillis how I'd been thinking about Stevens' use of the
figure of the indigene in his poetry, comparing it cleverly to the
way the UMaine cafeteria sells this delicious ice cream made from the
milk of cows from the own campus dairy, and thus it's indigenous too.
"Yes, well, no ice cream for me, thanks," said Miller politely.  Thus
we left things at a stalemate.  PS, what he wound up doing with his
doctorates is that, from now on when he gets one, he'll mark it with
a little pencil in one corner in tiny letters "Beijing University" or
whatever, and then he'll know.  We should all have such problems I
suppose.

That afternoon Thomas Travisano, who has edited the Lowell-Bishop
letters, gave a presentation of these letters to the assembled crowd.
His talk went smoothly until he decided to try out a new definition
of what was post-modern, a post-modernity in which Bishop and Lowell
would play central roles.  This position is one TT had sketched out
for readers earlier in his 1999 volume Midcentury Quartet.  Many
hands shot in the air, and there was quite a fray, Travisano must
have fled that hall thinking all the hounds of hell had their teeth
in his ass.  Robert van Hallberg really gave it to him, the crowd
went wild.  Face to face with Travisano, I didn't want to upset him
by asking him anything about his vision of postmodernism, so thinking
of the recent Duncan-Levertov letters and how they seem to libel the
living from beyond the grave, I asked TT if he was censoring anything
in the Bishop-Lowell correspondence.  "Oh not a bit.  Luckily the
people who they were negative about are all dead."  A shade of
perplexity crossed his elfin face.  "Richard Eberhart is dead, I
hope?  And Karl Shapiro?"  But nobody knew.  Isn't there a "Celebrity
Death Watch" that keeps track of these things for us?  Remember how
when Katharine Hepburn died, the bookies had it 6-5 that Bob Hope
would be next?  Actually just the day before Peter Middleton had been
describing to me, over lunch, being on the staff as a Visiting
British poet or something at a University in Florida and Richard
Eberhart was on the staff there, incredibly aged, but still hoping,
just as I would, that the young people in their fifties had heard of
him, and disappointed when it became clear Peter hadn't.  He was born
in 1904 after all.  Like Zukofsky, but no one expects Zukosky to be
alive.  People said The King and I was written about him because in
the 20s or whenever he was actually the tutor to the little princes
of Siam.

Across the room I saw Michael Scharf, who had come with a sleeping
bag and hoped to crash in somebody's dorm room.  He's a poet I think
very highly of and a very sweet person with a big heart.  Michael
drove up with a friend about whom I was very curious, the critic
Stephen Burt, whose book on Randall Jarrell I had read at Michael's
recommendation.  I shouldn't call him "the critic" because he is also
a poet, but I didn't know that when I shook his hand.  He is really
an odd duck, but his features are exquisitely sculptured, like the
tiny bones of one of the legendary 40s beauties like Denham Fouts or
Moira Shearer.  I couldn't take my eyes off him.  It wasn't a sexual
attraction, more the gaze of the connoisseur for the Ming vase.

In comparison Mike Scharf looked sleepy and gaunt, as though the
drive from Boston had been a Long March across thousands of miles.
"Are you hungry?"  He nodded.  I opened my bag and pulled out some
peanuts.  "They're healthy nuts and the doctor will approve," I said.
His pale hand closed around them.  I had to go to a panel so I gave
Mike the keys to my rented car, told him to stretch out, take forty
winks.  It was just outside in the parking lot.  While Mike slept in
my car, I went to one panel that sounded promising.  This was
"Literary History in/of the 1940s."  It would have been even better
had Kathleen Johnson been able to contribute (except that
unfortunately she couldn't make it to Maine) because she had promised
a paper on a topic that interests me mightily, the famous photographs
of "The Gotham Book Mart: November 9, 1948."  These photos, done for
LIFE Magazine I think, show an uneasy constellation of American
poetry in the postwar period.  Ostensibly they are backstage views of
Dame Edith Sitwell's triumphant reading tour of the USA, but in fact
they were staged carefully by the editors to give a highly mediated
picture of what was and was not to be the dominant modes of poetry
(and a bit of drama and fiction) in the Cold war period.  So they're
all there, kind of looking at the camera, some looking away, some
front and center hamming it up, some disgruntled, some discreet:
Auden's up on a ladder, Marianne Moore and Elizabeth Bishop pose
beneath him, Delmore Schwartz blinks at the camera, Jose Garcia Villa
holds up the doorway.  And many more including Gore Vidal, Tennessee
Williams, Eberhart, Jarrell, the poets of the 1940s.  You can see
this photo at http://www.finneganswake.org/GothamWriters.htm.  Well,
as I say, Kathy Johnson wasn't there but happily she's working on a
book about this topic so in time we'll all be able to read her
investigations.  I went anyway to the panel, though I had the feeling
it wouldn't keep me that long, that I was about to commit that
wretched act they call, "Panel Hopping."

So happily I caught David Adams' historical-bibliographical-detective
talk on two late 40s magazines, The Golden Goose and Chronos.  This
talk came with the most elaborate hand-outs you've seen since the
"Smell O Vision" cards John Waters gave out in Polyester.  I bet many
brought them home with them, packed carefully in their luggage, as a
challenge to the future, can I possibly improve on David Adams'
handouts?  The boring thing is that within the last six months ago I
read an article here in San Francisco that was written by a poet
whose name I can't remember.  He said that he was living in the Bay
Area in the 1950s, a very young lad, and took a job at some kind of
office, and little by little discovered that the dry, humorless,
spotlessly turned out fellow who was the marketing manager in the
corner office had had a past life among the poets and bohemians of
ten years before.  He allowed that he had known William Carlos
Williams and Creeley and Olson.  Indeed, the now tamed executive was
Richard Wirtz Emerson.  All through David Adams' talk I kept
expecting him to bring up this memoir.  I can almost picture myself
reading it, recalling vividly the tabloid size page, the black and
white illustrations, but I can't remember the name of the magazine or
the author.  Maybe it was George Evans-someone like him, of that
generation; maybe it was August Kleinzahler.

Anyway frustrated, I slipped out of the room and found yet another
panel, this one moderated by Al Filreis, one of those motley panels
where they throw everything together and call it, "Multiple Voices."
You'd think they would be more variegated than the "Wallace Stevens
II" and "III" panels.  This panel was actually titled "Beginning in
the 1940s."  I was sorry to have missed Susan Vanderborg's paper on
Jackson Mac Low.  Looked like Jackson missed it, too.  He must have
sat through a lot of papers in his lifetime, but if someone were
giving a paper on my work, I'd be right in the first row, bowing
modestly, nodding my head, perhaps coughing gently when the speaker
advanced some opinion about the work I personally didn't subscribe
to.  And I'd jump to my feet as soon as the speaker shut his mouth,
leading the applause, calling out for an encore.  You wouldn't have
to coax me, no sir.  But it looked as though Jackson and Anne had
sailed away like two ships in the night.  I did hear young Arlo
Quint, another of the U Maine grad students, give a paper about the
late Bern Porter, another enigma.  Porter is one of those figures,
like Oppen, that I think of as "high concept" - even people who don't
care about poetry can grasp their essence in one sentence, in
Porter's case, he was a physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project
and was so shattered by guilt when the atom bombs fell on Japan that
he became a poet.  In such formulations the truth always gets lost a
bit (to the "poetic") and so they're even more interesting to unpack,
and Quint did a yeoman's job working this out.  I like him.  Someone
told me that he and Ben Friedlander had gone to the old folks home
where Porter lived, so that Quint could interview him for his paper,
and he (Porter) died the next day!  I asked him if that was the case.
"Yes," he said, mournfully.  It was the saddest story I'd ever heard.

Thank you for not going on for five pages, Robin.

Actually, my question was why you bothered posting an attack which you
admitted at the time was biased. And changing the subject to the Buffalo
list doesn't alter the fact that you haven't answered.

But I'll let it go. It's Saturday and up and down the highways of the world,
super and otherwise, grumpy men are insulting each other for no good reason.

All the best

[Arlo Quint's Interview with Bern Porter]

"Bern Porter was too far gone to speak, and the whole room smelled.
I went back again, same story."  What a horrid interview, and I
thought I'd conducted some duds.  I told Quint that Bern Porter had
been very obliging to me when I'd queried him regarding the life of
Jack Spicer.  And how far apart the worlds of Berkeley and Maine
really are.  It was odd indeed how there was a Maine connection to
everything.  Then I read on the Poetics List that Bern Porter can be
glimpsed in the film of Stephen King's Thinner, which I remember
seeing when it came out.  A gypsy plays a trick on him.  How ironic!
In any case the panel wasn't the time or place for any of us to
express our doubts about Porter's legacy, he had died so recently it
would have been like stomping on his grave.  But I keep looking at
those "Founds" and just not seeing anything but warmed over Mad
Magazine surrealism.  You could assemble a million of them and
they're not going to assuage your guilt, not if you have a shred of
decency left in you.  I wondered if Porter had come to Maine in
penance, because you always have to wear long underwear there which
must be so uncomfortable.  I missed someone else give a paper on
Ashbery, and another fellow gave a talk on James Laughlin's poetic
career.  This fellow was cute in a preppy sort of way, in his early
30s I imagine and I was sorry to have missed a chance to hear him
talk more.  At the Q & A Marjorie Perloff raised her hand and said,
"This question is for Greg there . . .  Greg, you stated that James
Laughlin was okay with being passed over for the awards and prizes
and recognition.  Well, I knew him well-extremely well-we were
close-and" - voice darkening-"he was not okay with that."  Greg
defends his position, and Marjorie shakes her head, whether in
disbelief or in sorrow I don't know.  Really it wasn't even a
question.  I hate those panels about "Beginning in the 1940s," they
might as well do a paper on Jewel at American Poets of the 1970s
conference and say, well, she was alive in the 1970s.  Now, looking
at my program, I see that the man's name (who was so handsome, like a
track star at Mineola Prep) is Gregory Peter Barnhisel of Duquesne,
and his book-coming out in February-will be called James Laughlin,
New Directions, and the Remaking of Ezra Pound.  It promises to
answer the question I have always asked myself, how was it that after
the disgrace of the Fascist broadcasts, Laughlin was able to keep
Ezra Pound's name alive through marketing, even to the extent of
managing to increase its cultural capital, partly I suppose by
romanticizing the image of the old man locked up in the mental ward
in DC, etc., so that's another book to look forward to.

I must have missed the announcement, but I sidled up to one group
that included Burt Hatlen and gathered that Carl Rakosi had died.
One boy turned to me and pointed to a young woman who, he said in
awestruck tones, had burst into tears upon hearing this news
announced in the panel she was attending.  "She couldn't stop
crying," he said.  "Maybe she's his relation."  I could have thought
of a hundred things to say, but Burt said, "Later we'll think of a
way to memorialize Rakosi.  We were his publisher after all."  I take
it that he had been to Orono many times in the past and had been a
particular highlight of the conference on "American Poets of the
1930s" in 1993.  I said to Burt that if we were back in San Francisco
we would have a candlelight march in his honor.  He looked skeptical.
Maybe not knowing that in San Francisco we light candles at the drop
of a hat and commemorate, invigilate, protest everything with
candles.  "Do you have any candles in your office?"

"No," he said.  "Not a one."

"I'll go to Safeway," I said.  "Buy some candles."

"We'll talk about this later," Burt said.  "I can tell you're upset.
Maybe we'll read some of his poems, later."

"By candlelight?" I cried.  "That will be gorgeous."

I thought of the many times I had stopped Rakosi on the street in San
Francisco, introduced myself again and again.  He had helped us at
Small Press Traffic by signing a broadside of one of his poems,
"Woman." to raise money for a good cause.  When Brian Stefans and I
wrote our play The American Objectivists, we dropped Rakosi from the
dramatis personae, because we couldn't think of anything foolish
about him.  He was like Doris Twitchell Allen, I thought, the Maine
doctor whose memory we were honoring: he'd been determined to live
through his century.  And now he'd let his hand slip.

Kimberly Bird, from UC-Santa Cruz, who works at UC Berkeley's Oral
History Program, mentioned that she had interviewed Rakosi for 19
hours for a so-called "life history."  "Well, what do you think, Kim?
Don't you think Carl Rakosi would have wanted a candlelight march in
his honor?"

Kim was slightly non-committal.  I took it that in all 19 hours of
their interviews, Rakosi hadn't expressed an opinion one way or
another on candles.  I thought to myself, "If Michael Scharf is still
sleeping in my car, I'm gonna wake his ass up and make him help me
find some candles."

He was game, and indeed a whole slew of poets got into our cars and
went to a very late lunch.  (It was around 5:00 p.m.)  Good enough,
not that Orono has thousands of restaurants.  Indeed unless you've
seen the new thriller by M. Night Shyamalan you won't believe how
primitive a litrle village can get!  I walked on the sidewalk with
tall, fetching Paul Stephens from Columbia, one of the organizers of
the upcoming Zukofsky 100 conference there.  He looked at me, like,
"And who are you?"  "I'm Kevin Killian," I said brightly, pointing to
my ever-present badge.  He paused.  "Oh," he said. "I've heard of
you," he hazarded.

On both streets of the town, I went with Barbara Cole and Greg
Biglieri to hunt up some candles.  There was one store that only had
a few foodstuffs in it, aisles and aisles of empty shelves, here and
there some Twinkies and the like.  We split up to save time.  I found
a New Age shop where candles were about 2.00 apiece.  I was about to
buy a slew of them and Greg ran to me, saying that Barbara had found
a combination video rental and hardware store where the candles were
cheap, cheap, cheap.  Sure enough, these fat stubby white candles
about four inches high, in boxes of 6, each box was about a dollar!
The best bargain in decades.  At this point none of us was really
sure whether or not we could persuade anyone else to carry a candle
through campus on a candlelight march for Carl Rakosi, but we each
swore to carry one, possibly two ourselves, and Barbara Cole donated
her lighter to the cause.  So I think we got only about 50 candles,
and then went to lunch feeling pretty righteous.  I always think that
after a death, action's imperative, otherwise you just kind of stew
in it.

At the Bear Inn I got to sit with Steve Shoemaker on whom I can
always count to give me the lowdown on the Objectivists.  He was the
one of many I encountered on my trip, many guys who, for some reason,
were traveling for the first time after the birth of their children,
leaving their young at home with their wives.  It was almost as if
they were all bachelors again but none of them seemed willing to
relish this freedom, all of them looked pensively at photos of their
kids while showing them to me.  They seemed a bit surprised they
weren't having a better time, that they were missing being at home.
Then there was I, nodding and cooing at these digital photos of
adorable little infants who nearly all of them are girls for some
reason.  Here in San Francisco there hasn't been a baby girl born in
years as far as I know.  Steve had already given his talk, on Oppen's
silence during the 1940s, and was reveling in the panel's position
that the talismanic position of the poet during this decade was
silence.  It was all very ironic in the Alanis Morrisette sense.  I
was thinking of, say, Jane Fonda's absence from the movies after
Martin Ritt's Stanley and Iris (1990), and how she decided to end her
hiatus by returning to the screen playing Jennifer Lopez'
mother-in-law in the upcoming comedy feature Monster-in-Law, directed
by the man who did Legally Blonde.  Or even more provoking, why have
there been so few Meg Tilly pictures lately?

Then when I got back to the campus I showed our big purple bag of
white candles to Burt.  "Now we can hold the candlelight march after
all!" I cried.  Absently he stroked his chin.  "Well, we're planning
on doing something," he allowed.

Doug Rothschild and I sat through Marjorie Perloff's speech, which
was pretty good and predicated on a single proposition, that Samuel
Beckett was the world's greatest war poet, even though in all of his
work he never mentions the word "war."  It was a kind of Ripley's
Believe It or Not speech and sure enough provokes a number of
reactions, especially people saying, indeed he uses the word "war"
continually throughout his work.  Maybe Professor Perloff was
actually limiting her remarks to a few stories in Beckett's
collection Stories and Texts for Nothing.  She gave a
biographically-based account of Beckett's war years and stressed the
extent in which Beckett risked his life as a member of the French
Resistance, and indeed the medals and glory that he accrued after the
war once the Vichy Republic had been dissolved.

Joan Retallack's speech followed almost immediately.  Oddly enough
she and Perloff might as well have been twins at the same business,
for Retallack elected to speak on the dubious war record of Gertrude
Stein.  It almost seemed as if she was debating an invisible
opponent, the sly, vicious, take-no-prisoners Janet Malcolm, whose
New Yorker article on Stein had made more of an impression of many
than they had believed to be the case at the time.

I'm probably wrong, but, the picture Joan gave me was revisionary,
emblematic.  In her sure hands she built up a picture of a different
Gertrude Stein than the one we knew, this one aged, uncertain, scared
to death of her own foolishness, unsure of how little or how much to
deal with the Vichy officers who patrolled her town.  A writer who,
if she was blind, had blinded herself to the consequences of her own
actions through a superior dedication to the word.  Faced with the
iniquity of Nazi persecution and the inevitable compromise with
collaboration, she resembled no other character in literature more
than Mrs. What's her Name in A Passage to India.  Mrs. Moore.

Through both these talks Doug was writing down little quotes, a few
words here and there, quite industriously, on pages in a notebook.
Later on, when I heard him read, I realized he had been making up a
poem, collaged from different talks we had heard all the day long,
Perloff's and Retallack's most obviously.  I thought I was good at
multi-tasking but next to him I'm a dreamer, a drifter.  Then I got
to meet, in person, Lyman Gilmore, who wrote a good biography of the
poet Joel Oppenheimer (Don't Touch the Poet) and with whom I had been
in touch by phone or letter trying to untangle the relations between
Oppenheimer and Jack Spicer.  Gilmore is a great guy, and I said to
him that I'd seen in the program that he is now coming out with a
biography of William Bronk!  So soon since your last biography!
"Well," he said mildly, "that was in 1998."  Was it that long ago, it
seems like just yesterday, but still it would take me ten or fifteen
years to write another biography, especially on a figure as
mysterious as Bronk!  I wrote to him long ago (Bronk) asking him for
advice, advice to a young poet type of thing, and he wrote back the
single gloomiest letter I've ever gotten in the mail.  It was written
is dwindling spirals, each word visibly smaller than the one before
it, and basically it was saying that if you've decided to become a
poet, you're fucked.  That said, I can't wait to read Gilmore's life
of Bronk.

Former Black Panther's extradition case opens
Toronto library worker maintains innocence in shooting of police officer

Globe and Mail
By JONATHAN FOWLIE AND TIMOTHY APPLEBY
With a report from Gabrielle Giroday
Friday, July 30, 2004 - Page A7

A Toronto library assistant and former Black Panther accused of trying
to kill a Chicago policeman in 1969 will face the first stages of an
extradition hearing in a Toronto courtroom today, but maintains he is
not guilty, his lawyer said late yesterday afternoon.

"Mr. Pannell asserts his innocence and has complete confidence in the
Canadian judicial process," Gary Segal said of his client, Joseph
Coleman Pannell, adding that he and his co-counsel are only in the first
stages of piecing together the "history from 35 years ago."

Extradition proceedings were launched yesterday against Mr. Pannell in
connection with allegations he tried to kill Terrence Knox. Mr. Knox,
who retired from the Chicago police force in 1977, was left partly
paralyzed after a man shot 13 bullets into his squad car on March 7,
1969, hitting him three times in the arm and slicing a major artery.

Mr. Pannell was arrested after a foot chase immediately after the
shooting, but fled while on bail and has been living in Canada under an
assumed name since.

Police picked up the 55-year-old's trail July 8 after the Federal Bureau
of Investigation compared the wanted fugitive's fingerprints with
databases in Canada.

The fingerprints matched those of a man by the name of Douglas Gary
Freeman, who had been fingerprinted in 1983 when he was fined $300 under
the Customs Act for smuggling.

Filed yesterday, the application for extradition shows that on Tuesday,
the night he was arrested, Mr. Pannell had been carrying an Ontario
driver's licence registered to Douglas Freeman. While in custody that
night, he confirmed he was Joseph Pannell.

It also reveals that Mr. Pannell, born on May 5, 1949, in Washington,
has gone by at least seven aliases, including Yusuf, Joe Nathan and
Douglas Gary Freeman.

That application also reveals that Mr. Pannell had lived in Quebec for
more than 18 years before moving to Mississauga, Ont., near Toronto, in
April of 1987. Most recently, he was living at an address on Galbraith
Drive with his spouse Natercia Coelho, who also worked at the Metro
Toronto Reference Library, the documents show.

Last night, neighbours said Mr. Pannell lived with his three daughters,
believed to be in their 20s, and had a son who had moved away from home.

"They are the perfect neighbours," said Ricardo Gimenez, 26, who lives
across the street from the family's two-storey pink brick house. "I
can't believe they want to deport the guy and ruin a family."

Neighbours said Mr. Pannell and his family had moved into the house
about a month ago, but that they had been moving around in the
neighbourhood for at least a year.

Many said they used to see Mr. Pannell jogging every day, often with Ms.
Coelho and their daughters.

Mr. Pannell, who reportedly hid his past from his family, was served
with an arrest warrant yesterday while in custody at the Metro West
Detention Centre, stemming from the U.S. federal extradition application.

At the time, he was being held in connection with an allegation that he
had not disclosed his criminal record when he crossed into Canada nearly
35 years ago.

Mr. Pannell will appear this morning in Ontario Superior Court of
Justice for the first phase of what will likely be a lengthy court
procedure under the Extradition Act.

U.S. authorities have charged him with attempted murder, three counts of
aggravated battery and two of unlawful flight.

In November of 1970, after he was first arrested in the shooting of Mr.
Knox, Mr. Pannell was released on bail. He was then taken into custody
by military authorities for having been absent without leave from the
U.S. Navy since Oct. 3, 1968.

While in military custody, the extradition application shows, Mr.
Pannell admitted to shooting Mr. Knox. He also admitted to being a
member of the Black Panthers, a revolutionary black nationalist movement
founded in 1966.

He was later released but failed to appear in court, only to be arrested
once again in June of 1972 on charges of attempted murder and jumping bail.

After posting a $10,000 (U.S.) bond, Mr. Pannell was released on bail
once again, but skipped and travelled north to Montreal, where police
believe he assumed the name Douglas Gary Freeman.

In the most recent charges, Mr. Pannell may seek bail but is unlikely to
get it. Police have also said that in light of the extradition
proceedings, the immigration matter will likely fall by the wayside.

At the Toronto Reference Library yesterday, staff were tight-lipped,
either claiming not to know the man who had worked there as a research
assistant for 13 years, or saying they did not wish to discuss the case
with the media.

Some did say, however, that library management had met with each
department yesterday morning to discuss the arrest and how to deal with
the aftermath, but would not say if they had been told to keep quiet.

Asked what was discussed at the staff meetings, library spokeswoman
Tania Ensor said, "I don't know that I can comment on that right now."

She added that the library is "co-operating with the police" but refused
to release any information about Mr. Pannell or his work history.

One co-worker who initially claimed not to know him eventually said she
knew both Mr. Pannell and his wife.

"He's a nice guy," the woman said, not wanting to give her name, but
saying Mr. Pannell had worked on the third floor of the five-storey
building. "They're a nice couple."

Another employee who heard of the arrest through the media yesterday
morning called the situation "upsetting."

"It's not a pleasant situation," she said, also not wanting to be
identified.

Calvin Trillin's "Obliviously On He Sails: The Bush Administration in
Rhyme" is a rarity among <b>poetry</b> collections: a best-seller (debut
at No. 7 on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list) ... His
salary is $100 a poem, a rate that has not changed since he began in
1990...
