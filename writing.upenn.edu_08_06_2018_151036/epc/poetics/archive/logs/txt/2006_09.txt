1) Plenty of great stuff happens in the "indymedia" world. Like anywhere else, it depends on who's controlling (or, in the best cases, doing their best not to control) what gets through. In some places, it's a genuine forum for disparate views in the community, and in fact helps a community into existence. Even where there is a de facto tyranny of shared opinion, it's at least an alternative to the official line one gets from the mainstream media. It continues to amaze me, how much harder people are on flawed attempts to do something different than on the much more powerful institutions to which they were intended as exceptions (note that this sentence is not meant to say that those alternatives shouldn't be criticized for their shortcomings).

2) This recent, repeated equation of rigor, selectivity, and art in general with fascism is really a load of crap. Come on. Ok, to be more articulate: any human activity that involves or produces something new, or pleasurable, or that gives existence some kind of significance involves some setting of boundaries, some restrictions, the drawing of an outline within which "this is the thing that's happening." There are always elements/influences/voices/approaches/whathaveyous that are excluded by the project. And that's fine. Those excluded things can be involved in some other projects, and as long as nobody is trying to prevent them from happening, with the power to do so, talk of totalitarianism is pretty flaccid. And if I write "experimental" poetry, that doesn't mean I'm trying to destroy slam poetry, or conventional nature poetry, or pop songwriting, or... they're just different projects than the ones in which I'm engaged (actually, I'm engaged in songwriting sometimes,
 too--and it's a separate project, one that generally excludes the kinds of language use characteristic of the poems I write).

Art is not politics. That's one reason a discussion about their relation can be so significant for people who want their art to address political matters (or who don't). In either sphere, inflexible hierarchies and repression of possibilities are problems, and temporary/local hierarchies (such as produce the set of concerns central to a given artwork, or a given social project) and actualization of some possibilities at the temporary/local expense of others (or production of new possibilities at the expense of pre-existing ones) are not.

Certain groups or cultures can become invested in bonding together in
collective excitement in order to (1) structure time and (2) avoid
intimate honesty -- by rehearsing what Eric Berne called "scripts."

The one Simon DeDeo recently described on a listserv -- "seeking status
through the promise of a new yet unapproachable revitalization of
poetry" -- is a cultural script for poetry, one played over and over
through the centuries and with particular strength since about 1914
(let's say just after Wyndham Lewis's BLAST). A script, in Eric Berne's
terms, is a transactional game inscribed into a family's behavior
patterns or into a culture's.

Another term for the game described above is "If it Weren't For Them."

The crying for the reformation of poetry is not really about the
reformation of poetry. It's about getting something (self or group
aggrandizement) via crying. Thumping the hand at the woeful state of X
helps create the perception that (a) something is wrong, and (b) we're
the folks, or I'm the guy (usually a guy), to set this right. In other
words, crying about the woeful state of X is a surreptitious boast. A
boast to the effect that either "we/I see what others for years have
not," or "we/I are the only ones, after years of others, who can fix this."

It's often an excuse to play at having an "Uproar." Sometimes, if
challenged, the game player will try to play "Courtroom." "What do you
mean by saying that I was behaving in X manner? That was not my
intention! Explain yourself, please: I'd really love to know! Maybe I
could learn something from you. But let's talk about my behavior, and
whose perceptions about it are accurate, yours or mine, or his, etc --
and how you think I'm not being good. Yes, now about my behavior, which
certainly was reasonable...."

Variants of "Courtroom" are "See What You've Done Now" (eg, you upset my
kid) or "Want Out," in which people begin yelling they want out of a
conversation but don't really leave.

Another variant is "Whiz Kids," which is like "Revolution," except less
violent, harsh and destructive. "Whiz Kids" players in "Poetry" promote
and advertise a new approach, a new style, a new method, as a means of
solving a problem or resolving a dialectic (Flarf, eg). "Maverick" is a
particularly male and heteronormative variant of "Whiz Kids," one played
by an individual and an allied group; eg, Joel Oppenheimer (_Don't Touch
the Poet_) or Charles Bernstein (_My Way_), Charles Bukowski, et al, and
its self-destructive variant "Drunkard," played by Jack Kerouac, John
Berryman, et al., in which it's made known that "the reason I'm drunk is
I'm successful; my boorish transgressions will be forgiven if you have
any taste."

A variant of this in younger members is "Young Turk," in which a
combative young man is, often through the imprimatur of a "Maverick,"
encouraged to play the part of a new transgressor. Some encourage their
own sons to adopt this painful role, which those sons willingly do if in
doing so they can briefly draw their father's attention away from his
own self-fascination.

Needless to say, social permission is needed for all these games. Such
permission is typically handed out to X, Y, or Z depending upon their
traits and credibility. "Drunkard," for instance, is often only allowed
in well established successful members. If it's displayed too early (by
non-credentialed members) it won't work. It can also be played by some
who aren't very well know but who nevertheless adopt the role of
drunkard/transgressor and use self-righteous anger to deepen the role in
the hopes that drunkenness and transgression alone will be seen as a
marker of current or future success.

  Liquid dimples  Webster's defines "Privation" as:
  What Mary must be missing is the time of smooth silence and sinuous glass;  light quelled for Autumn, Summer's riot brought to its knees and sighing,  sighing, sighing to be released. I'd sign anything she put in front of me, as  long as I could use your signature. Liquid dimples pepper spice, lying before us  indolently and secure; from somewhere else a light breeze coiled its hair.  Remember to shower, it says. Don't forget to re-attach the arms and legs of your  favorite action figures. What Mary needs to understand about the Kingbury Run  murders is that memory lets you pick stuff up, like cellphone convos or LMFAO at  RTFM. Just how much fun is Slinky, tumbling down Brady Bunch stairs  like the musculature of the serpent, just before Atari 2600 rats us out to  Homeland Security? I don't feel so secure, I'll tell you what. I'll tell you  what Mary needs, or I'll start needing it too.
 Me, I'm missing the smooth cilia along the throat where laughter pushes that  stalwart wind.



 08/31/06  Electric Boogaloo!  Webster's defines "Doubt" as:
  Teach me electric boogaloo, Don Juan! To Obiwan this string-dark dope, this  painful escape, this singing singed but blasted from tapping, and to hell with  Bing Crosby! Bio-Dome is from an auteur! Bound head to ass, dead AIDS  genomes, deepening with fiscal siphoning, or I must have gone home with children  unbeknownst of time, empire. You get 'em together and they make cameras to watch  one another around each others' things. Waist-deep asleep, Mary, smooth brown  soothing white, the Oracle ovoid with a round emptiness dangling from her mouth  as she snores, oh boy! I wanted to get away from music for a change. Did you  feel this shift into a major key? Gosh! Victory becomes civil when mornings roam  unimpeded through Volvo graves. Polite but impregnable, I'm lactating from pure  tattoos of the essence of objects; naturally, to pry Idea from Form. I'm a human  beatbox in the cave but I swerve between evolving and fumes! I'm a human beatbox  in the cave but I'm a virgin,
 too, when it comes to getting through  this.
 Wave your hands in the air. Swing them like you just don't care.

Andy: It continues to amaze me, how much harder people are
on flawed attempts to do something different than on the
much more powerful institutions to which they were intended
as exceptions.


Eric: If people indeed are more critical of Indymedia (not
sure this is so), it may be because we all know what the
"powerful institutions" are. Everyone knows what Fox News
is, how the Washington Post or the Washington Times will
report a story, and what to expect from National Review or
The Nation.

Media is a fashion statement: "I'm wearing Mother Jones
magazine with The Nation. She's wearing Frontpage Magazine
with her National Review. And--you won't believe this!--she
came to the media party with a see-through Z-Mag over an
al-Jazeera...al-Jazeera is so 2002!"

In my own experience, New York Indymedia was very good when
covering local issues--cops hassling biking groups, news of
protests at the GOP Convention--but it was usually straight
party-line Stalin when covering issues of the larger world.

In these larger issues, Indymedia presents itself as news of
the people, intended to be above all the "fashion
statements," to be truly populist, to be... "indy." Instead
it usually offers just another flavor of party-line radical
left. That's bad faith, no matter what your politics. It's
no better than Fox News calling itself "fair and balanced."

what would you call the primary dimensions of a word?  i've read that an
individual word may have over a hundred dimensions, but let's say we are
limited to just three, for any type of word..

i'm preparing to write a computer program to automate the assignment of
these dimensions based on their dictionary definitions, and then by
discrete input and automated web searches for assignment based on the
proximity to other words in a very broad sample of writing.  it's a very
basic approach, tho i must start with something..

what do you think of this approach? what three dimensions do you note of
a given word, either by itself or w/in a phrase or sentence?  this
note-taking is normally done w/ unconscious mental filters, as it's
irrelevant to the higher functioning of our understanding and perception.

Also, the visual thesaurus leaps to mind as being relevant:

Dan,

the TextArc program appears to be an advanced visual interface.  i will
install it in windows later on and see what it does.  the verbogeometry
page, so far, is similar to what i have in mind.  i only ask about three
dimensions because it is intuitive to the cartesian system, and then two
or more of them can be mapped w/o math beyond elementary discrete math &
calculus, i.e. something realistic for me.  when i have a visual
interface ready, i will send you the program.

Catherine,

this is a great idea.  tho i'm struggling to visualize how to implement
this w/o expert direction, it seems that i could make a database of the
etymological stems, zero them in the representation, and map an
"electron cloud" of present cognates.  this might be the best start,
better than mapping words to pseudo-arbitrary dimensions, tho i'm still
very interested for other suggestions.

thanks!

How about

- appearance
- meaning
- linkability?


Those three overlap to some extent and can be divided into many subgroups.

Linkability is the word's ability to be combined into phrases with
other words, and also its ability to refer to antecedent words.
Linkability might also include the forming of compounds and perhaps
even inflections by suffixes or prefixes. Those could also be part of
appearance.

Appearance would split in two: how the word sounds and how it looks
in writing (possibly also how it feels in braille). Appearance would
thus also include phenomena like rhyming, which in turn is a sort of
link (to another place in the same text). Obsolescence or novelty
could be yet other parts of appearance. Other subgroups could be, for
instance, idiosyncrasies in pronunciation and dialect (sound) or
handwriting (look).

Meaning includes both a word's own meaning and the nuances of various
qualifiers.

that's really interesting. as you're describing it, it sounds like this is an unavoidable aspect of social formation. so therefore: if i am a young poet (28 is still young, right?) then i want to be credentialed. what does one have to do to get credentialed in order to begin using these scripts. also, what's the "revolution" script you mentioned but didn't describe. and where do people like Jorie Graham or Dana Gioia, who very much like to think of themselves as "revitalizers of poetry," but who so obviously are not?

i haven't read the other responses yet, but here is my initial reaction

a map of a word has on it's X axis all of the denotative semantic content of the word. It's Y axis is the conotative semantic content. the Z axis is the words surface grammar, things such as parts of speech, morphology, etc. the t axis (fourth dimension) would have it's depth grammar, or pragmatics, that is, the set of language games in which the word can be used in a sensible way. There is also the Q axis which contains the word's phonological properties, phonetics, stresses, syllable length and weight, etc. If you want a sixth dimension, I would suggest etymology, but that's maybe going too far.

Give Hip Hop Credit for Anti-War songs
by Davey D

The other night ABC News did a special report on the growing popularity
of anti-war protest songs. The report focused on how all these musicians
were now coming out and providing a sound track to the growing
discontent many of us are having with the war in Iraq. It talked about
how people are more accepting of such songs and how major record labels
were loosening up in the aftermath of the Dixie Chicks who got lambasted
and later boycotted for speaking out against George Bush and his
policies in 2003.

The report also brought to light the impact anti-war songs had on
fueling the Anti-war movement against Vietnam in the late 60s and the
question was raised as to what sort of impact todays rash of songs would
have.

I cant remember all the singers they profiled, but I did recall seeing
country singer Merle Haggard, Rock-N-Roll icon Bruce Springstein and pop
sensation Pink. What surprised me was not seeing any mention of Hip Hop
especially with the exception of KRS-One, since it was artists in the
rap community that up to date have released more anti-war songs and were
the first to unabashedly do so right after 9-11.

If we take a short walk down memory lane, folks may recall that the day
after 9-11 Bay Area Hip Hop activists from organizations like Lets Get
Free, The Ella Baker Center and Minds Eye Collective put together a
rally that was held in Snow Park in Oakland. Close to 500 people
attended this event which focused on the loss of human life and
questioned the foreign policy missteps of the Bush administration. It
was at this rally that many of us heard our last poem from the late June
Jordan.

We also heard an incredible song from Michael Franti & Spearhead calling
for healing and peace. A couple of months later, Franti appeared on
Conan OBrian and performed the anti-war song Bomb the World to Pieces
only to find that his sentiments angered producers who threatened to
censor the song when the show aired. Community outrage lead to OBrians
people eventually showing the performance.

Early on we heard anti-war songs from acts like the Beastie Boys (World
Gone Mad), Nas (Rule), Wu-Tang Affiliates Known Associates (World So
Cold), Talib Kweli (the Proud), J-Live (Satisfied) and Mr Lif (home of
the Brave). Of course we also have numerous joints from Immortal
Technique including 'The Povery of Philosophy'. All in all there are
more than 150 anti-war songs that have been recorded by Hip Hop artists.

The song that really made heads turn was by Bay Area artist Paris who
came out of retirement and released a 6 minute missive called What Would
You Do? that went into great detail about The Caryle Group, Bushs
relationship to the Bin Laden family and the hawkish action plans of the
Neo-cons serving in Bushs cabinet. Paris gave the song away for free and
then followed it up with an entire antiwar album called Sonic Jihad
which went on to sell over 200 thousand units.

Another stand out effort came from San Francisco based Freedom Fighter
records who released the first anti-war compilation featuring Bay Area
artists called War Times Report From the Opposition. A year later LA
based Hard Knock Records followed up with a critically acclaimed
anti-war compilation called What About Us.

The most visible anti-war effort to date came from former San Jose
resident Fredwreck who has produced tracks from everyone ranging from
Eminem to Snoop Dogg and Ice Cubeto name a few. Using the name STOP
Movement he gathered up a number of popular artists including Mobb Deep,
WC of the Westside Connection, Daz of the Dogg Pound, RBX, Defari,
Soopafly, Cypress Hill, Mack 10, KRS-One and Dilated Peoples just to
name a few and released two anti-war songs called Down With Us and Dear
Mr. President.

Fredwreck like Paris gave away the songs for free and even held a press
conference only to find local commercial stations would not touch the
record in spite of the big name artists he had assembled. In fact
sources inside one popular station in LA, KKBT, noted that their deejays
were instructed not to play those songs because they were too
controversial. Whats even more ironic was Fred was supposed to be
profiled in the ABC story. He was flown to NY but not shown in the
report that I saw.

The other irony was after ABC aired the report one of the anchors
decided to comment and naively noted that she never heard any of the
songs from the artists they profiled on the radio therefore they must
not be hits. We could do an entire column on what goes on behind the
scenes and what it really takes to get records on the commercial
airwaves, but suffice to say if what happened to Fredwreck is any
indication of how key power brokers at radio get down, then of course we
would not hear any of these songs on radio. However, it does not mean
those songs or those artists are not popular or that people are not
appreciative of their songs.

Thereâ€™s Always Strength in Words:

An Interview w/ Hasan Salaam, Akir and Hicoup

By Davey D

Whoever said Conscious Hip Hop artists canï¿½t get down or that Hip Hop
from the NY (East Coast) is dead simply has not tapped into the
burgeoning cultural inspired rap scene that has everyone from dead prez
to Immortal Technique making noise. Alongside them are artists like
Hasan Salaam, Hicoup and Akir just to name a few. We sat down with them
the other day when they swung through Oakland for the Strength in Words
Tour.

I gotta be honest it was nice building with these cats. In fact we
barely spoke about their projects, which include Hasanï¿½s ï¿½Lost Paradiseï¿½
album, Hicoupâ€™s Ghetto Factory Supremeï¿½ mixtape and Akirï¿½s debut LP
ï¿½Legacyï¿½. Instead we talked in depth about the Middle East including the
conflict in Lebanon. This was critically important especially when you
take into account that Hasan has a song on his album called "Hezbollah".

Hip-hop culture reflects
Youth oppression under capitalism
By Larry Hales
Published Mar 7, 2006 10:22 PM

â€œ...Or does it explode?â€ This ominous question ends Langston Hughesâ€™
poem, â€œHarlem,â€ which begins with, â€œWhat happens to a dream deferred?â€

In the mid-to-late 1970s, there was a musical explosion emanating from
poor Black and Puerto Rican youth in the South Bronx. To understand
hip-hop culture, which encompasses a style of dress, speech, graffiti
art, and a certain political orientation towards the capitalist state,
it is essential to know exactly what was happening in the United States,
especially in the nationally oppressed communities leading up to its
inception.

During the 1970s, the state of the capitalist economy and the effect it
would have on workers was becoming evident. The Vietnamese had emerged
victorious from a devastating war in 1975. Thousands of drafted and
enlisted U.S. soldiers and marines, many of them people of color in
disproportionate numbers, lost their lives. Many thousands more were
physically and/or emotionally maimed for life.

The U.S. imperialist ruling classâ€™s brutal war against the Vietnamese
people had drawn billions of dollars away from the social needs of
people in the United States. The soldiers who were forced to fight the
war returned home with no safety net. Many had become addicted to drugs
and alcohol and wound up homeless.

The country was in an economic recession. Major industrial manufacturers
were already closing plants around the country especially in the
Northeast, which later became known as the Rust Belt. Whites had already
begun to move from urban to suburban areas, resulting â€˜white flightâ€™.
Development in the inner cities virtually ceased, leaving what social
services that existed and the public school systems in these areas
woefully inadequate. Public hospitals were usurped by privately run
facilities creating a sub-standard health care system for the poor and
oppressed.

The prison system, which housed 200,000 inmates in 1970, had begun its
steady climb towards its current level of over 2.1 million prisoners,
the largest population worldwide. The racist death penalty was
reinstated in 1976. Many Black people who fled the low-paying jobs in
the South found higher paying, unionized jobs in the North following the
Vietnam War.

FREE THE P! PALESTINE TAKES NYC'S EAST VILLAGE BY STORM
Remi Kanazi, The Electronic Intifada, 17 October 2005

As I walk down the darkened staircase into a muggy
basement in this lower eastside dive bar, a scruffily
bearded supporter smiles and waves a four-foot wide
Palestinian flag. The chatter begins as the room fills
with anxious people awaiting the show. The young crowd
came out to support Free the P, the new CD compilation of
"hip-hop and spoken word, dedicated to the youth of
Palestine." The proceeds will go to Slingshot Hip-hop, "a
documentary film that focuses on the daily life of
Palestinian rappers living in Gaza, the West Bank and
inside Israel." Within moments, our hostess, Arab-American
comedienne Maysoon Zayid, takes the ground level,
makeshift stage and gets the crowd going with her dry,
political humor....

Support the STOP Movement! STOP: Stop The Oppressive Politics!

We the people of the United States of America have gathered together to
express our views against the oppression of people across the Earth by
the imperialistic policy makers of our government. They want all the
nations of the world to bow down and abide by rules and laws they impose
behind the curtain of the United Nations, yet when those laws go against
the political agenda of the administration they themselves break the law
and feloniously fabricate propaganda to mislead the world and American
people that Iraq has "Weapons of Mass Destruction", and will use them on
America. Evidence to validate this fantasy still to this day does not
exist, even after the CIA unsuccessfully tried to fabricate documents to
prove so. Next we have the shameful attempt by Governor Bush and his
gang to link the unfortunate events of September 11th and Osama Bin
Laden to the leadership of the Iraqi Government. Proof or evidence of
which also does not exist. Mr. Bush has been left with no other card in
his deck to play, so he created his own, the deck of "Wanted Terrorists"
within a charade of humanitarianism. The only way for him to gain any
popular acceptance is to have a campaign of misleading propaganda to
make us believe that he's on a self-righteous mission to liberate the
Iraqi people, and that this war is a war about freedom and democracy for
the people of Iraq. This is yet another delusion of grandeur by our
so-called fearless leader. He will not hoodwink or deceive us! America's
oppressive foreign policy, which resorts to bribery, corruption, dirty
dealings, and murder assassination, will continue to produce hatred,
mistrust, and animosity. This dangerous environment that our policies
have bred puts us at far greater risk of being blind sided and harmed by
threats unknown. This threat multiplies with each aggression toward the
nations of the world. Aggression sometimes concealed behind diplomacy,
which can be more dangerous than war itself. This hostile behavior must
stop. If we are going to start opening the books and passing judgment on
world leaders lets not hesitate to start with members of our government.
Let's also call out the governments of some our so-called allies. Then
we can all be playing eye-to-eye on an even field. Until then, take a
stand to S.T.O.P. the oppressive politics. Stop the killing of other
nation's children and bring our sons and daughters home.

Peace,

[i added a word to the subject heading]

jason, (1) scripts and transactional games are not inevitable or
unavoidable. it feels really good to be around colleagues and friends
who don't play them.

(2) you ask about what I meant by naming a particular transactional game
“revolution."

a transactional game is basically an act of subterfuge: a person or
group says or displays one set of behaviors, while being interested in a
hidden payoff. those playing “revolution” as a transactional game aren’t
really interested in radical change.

their interests stem from, rise from, ressentiment: they *want* what the
purport to eradicate.

so, if in an area of cultural production you’ve got someone talking
about a revolution in the area of a certain artistic genre, but who
basically uses this rhetoric to place himself/herself, or their faction,
in a position of cultural power, a position that fundamentally
strengthens the institutions they’d sd they would destroy, that is a
transactional game.

for instance, if an author or small group say they are interested in
heteronymic writing and make a show of using the rhetoric of heteronymic
writing and its concomitant modes of cultural production to destroy the
author function, but really wind up entrenching himself or themselves as
“author” – this is a transactional game.

generally those playing “revolution” do the following. they (defying
Olson’s “What does not change / is the will to change”)

-	cast change as rare
-	cast the will to change as rare
-	cast the will to change as belonging only to themselves, their party,
their faction
-	conflate “rebellion” with revolution; inflating their small and
imbalanced flarings of disgust, aversion, hatred, ill will from a
rebellion to a revolution
-	are generally mean and violent
-	wind up entrenching what they purported to destroy
-       get paranoid, for good reason

most political revolutions are just rebellions forced down the throats
of the people. the scientific revolution or the “quiet revolution” of
the Quebecois are examples of true revolution: a whole culture or modus
tipping over.

Interesting! What's the term for the game in which the
poet types and judges every other poet's behavior from
a position of moral superiority with
pseudo-sociological trappings? The "H.L. Mencken,"
maybe?The "Ambrose Bierce"?

I mean, on the level of humor I actually quite like
some of these sneering satirical descriptions below,
but this sort of response to the often troubling
behavior of other poets is a common feature of poet
behavior as well, and related to the concept of the
"Maverick" in ways too obvious to need much stating.

Turns out you can't describe this particular game
without already being one of the players, eh?

And since I must be playing too, what's the term for
the game in which the poet suggests that typing the
behavior of other poets in a dismissive manner is good
fun but bad criticism?

Certain groups or cultures can become invested in
bonding together in
collective excitement in order to (1) structure time
and (2) avoid
intimate honesty -- by rehearsing what Eric Berne
called "scripts."

The one Simon DeDeo recently described on a listserv
-- "seeking status
through the promise of a new yet unapproachable
revitalization of
poetry" -- is a cultural script for poetry, one played
over and over
through the centuries and with particular strength
since about 1914
(let's say just after Wyndham Lewis's BLAST). A
script, in Eric Berne's
terms, is a transactional game inscribed into a
family's behavior
patterns or into a culture's.

Another term for the game described above is "If it
Weren't For Them."

The crying for the reformation of poetry is not really
about the
reformation of poetry. It's about getting something
(self or group
aggrandizement) via crying. Thumping the hand at the
woeful state of X
helps create the perception that (a) something is
wrong, and (b) we're
the folks, or I'm the guy (usually a guy), to set this
right. In other
words, crying about the woeful state of X is a
surreptitious boast. A
boast to the effect that either "we/I see what others
for years have
not," or "we/I are the only ones, after years of
others, who can fix
this."

It's often an excuse to play at having an "Uproar."
Sometimes, if
challenged, the game player will try to play
"Courtroom." "What do you
mean by saying that I was behaving in X manner? That
was not my
intention! Explain yourself, please: I'd really love
to know! Maybe I
could learn something from you. But let's talk about
my behavior, and
whose perceptions about it are accurate, yours or
mine, or his, etc --
and how you think I'm not being good. Yes, now about
my behavior, which
certainly was reasonable...."

Variants of "Courtroom" are "See What You've Done Now"
(eg, you upset
my
kid) or "Want Out," in which people begin yelling they
want out of a
conversation but don't really leave.

Another variant is "Whiz Kids," which is like
"Revolution," except less
violent, harsh and destructive. "Whiz Kids" players in
"Poetry" promote
and advertise a new approach, a new style, a new
method, as a means of
solving a problem or resolving a dialectic (Flarf,
eg). "Maverick" is a
particularly male and heteronormative variant of "Whiz
Kids," one
played
by an individual and an allied group; eg, Joel
Oppenheimer (_Don't
Touch
the Poet_) or Charles Bernstein (_My Way_), Charles
Bukowski, et al,
and
its self-destructive variant "Drunkard," played by
Jack Kerouac, John
Berryman, et al., in which it's made known that "the
reason I'm drunk
is
I'm successful; my boorish transgressions will be
forgiven if you have
any taste."

A variant of this in younger members is "Young Turk,"
in which a
combative young man is, often through the imprimatur
of a "Maverick,"
encouraged to play the part of a new transgressor.
Some encourage their
own sons to adopt this painful role, which those sons
willingly do if
in
doing so they can briefly draw their father's
attention away from his
own self-fascination.

Needless to say, social permission is needed for all
these games. Such
permission is typically handed out to X, Y, or Z
depending upon their
traits and credibility. "Drunkard," for instance, is
often only allowed
in well established successful members. If it's
displayed too early (by
non-credentialed members) it won't work. It can also
be played by some
who aren't very well know but who nevertheless adopt
the role of
drunkard/transgressor and use self-righteous anger to
deepen the role
in
the hopes that drunkenness and transgression alone
will be seen as a
marker of current or future success.

What about the "game of no game"? Or the "game of being
aware of games"?

The difficulty of Eric Berne's work--which is modern
dressing for an old quest--is that it doesn't account for
the constant need to re-examine motives. Nobody is above
that endless game, which constantly rewrites the script.

Consider Erikson's _Gandhi's Truth_, where he presents
Gandhi as someone who wanted to be a father to his father.
The best way for Gandhi to play his game, fathering his
father, was to be a superpious superleader. Yet Gandhi too
was divorced from his own motives; which may explain, in
part, how that particular man of peace was such a lousy
father to his own children.

Motives, motives, motives--and our resistance to
understanding our own protean motives once and for all. It's
the stuff of poetry.

Best,
Eric

"Summer's gone, but a lot goes on
forever"--Leonard Cohen


Cy Gist Press is happy to announce the release of
3 new chapbooks as we bid summer farewell and
stumble into autumn and everything after.


EXERTIONS
by Scott Glassman
(20 pp. Sewn Binding) $6

Scott Glassman's first chapbook offers
simultaneously alien and quotidian glosses on the
perils of existing alone and with others.
Scott's take on the prose poem operates by way of
arpeggios of contrapuntal phrases threatening to
tear the form apart while giving them surprising
rhythmic balance.  For ordering and a sample poem
go here: http://www.cygistpress.com/epage.htm.


CARACAS NOTEBOOK
by Guillermo Parra
(20 pp. Saddle-Stapled with Linen binding, B&W
photographs) $6

Guillermo Parra's lyric paen to the city and the
dramatically changing face of Venezuela at the
beginning of this century is rife with exile and
nostalgia.  These are poems from between--between
languages, cultures, identities and forms.
Sparse, objectivist-inspired poems are mingled
with direct but enigmatic prose reminiscent, to
my mind, of W.G. Sebald.  Like Sebald, these
poems are homesick for a point of origin which
may or may not have ever existed.  With black and
white photographs of Caracas by Isabel Parra.
For ordering and a sample poem go here:
http://www.cygistpress.com/cnpage.htm.


FACE TIME
(22 pp. Sewn Binding, B&W photographs, mirrored
cover) $6

What do Paris Hilton, Al Pacino, Hilda Doolittle,
Charlize Theron, Marcello Mastroianni and a
quivering, self-eviscerated blob have in common?
Find out in FACE TIME, an anthology of poets
responding to stills from films.  Featuring work
by:

Joe Hall, Craig Perez, Noah Falck, Phil Crippen,
Matina L. Stamatakis, Francois Luong, Brian
Lucas, Nicole Mauro, Jessica Smith, G.L. Ford,
Mark Lamoureux, Christina Strong, Michael Carr,
Sandra Simonds, John Mulrooney, Brenda Iijima and
Christopher Rizzo.

Agreeing to disagree on that point, as the thrust of everything I would say against it has been covered quite nicely by Eric Yost's post; but what
about the rest of the question? What is this credentialing process you're talking about? I'd argue that as soon as one has committed oneself to the
validity of such credentials, which is seems you do, it's necessary for the word colleagues to have a context different from friends, then the playing
of games such as the ones you've described are completely unavoidable and are a part and parcel of the idea that there is an "in" circle and an "out"
circle. More to the point, I'd argue that it's patently obvious that there's an in circle of Socials and an out circle of Greases in every community
group, and the only choice that anyone has as far as their sociological relationship to game playing is whether or not they're going to participate in
what the in crowd is up to. Being in with the in-crowd, as it were, or being a determined Outsider committed to Outsiderness, is the only step
possible. From that point, your scripts, so very loosely defined, take over. Occasionally somebody throws up his hands, says almost everbody, soc and
outsider alike, are wasting everyone's time on nonsense, and goes and gets a job at the post office or something. But those kinds of people are rare.
On the other hand, taking poetry as a less than arbitrary e.g., the fact that there are at least two groups of poets in American lit; that is those
who think there are at least two groups (outsiders, beats, post-avants, moderns, postmoderns, polar bears or whatever you want to call them) and those
who don't think there are two groups (the school of quietude, official verse culture, academic poets as the slam community understands the term
academic (to mean everyone is an academic who doesn't slam, etc. I'd argue that there are therefore at least three groups, the Socs (Jorie Graham,
Billy Collins, Ted Kooser, Sharon Olds, Glyn Maxwell etc), the Greasers(Paul Hoover, Ron Silliman, Charles Bernstein, Rae Armentrout, etc), and the
folks who think that there is a difference between a Soc and a Greaser but who claim to be neither one nor the other(Bill Knott, Dean Young, David
Lehman), but somehow elevated above the rumble. When I was in highschool, kids like that were called Dorks because they didn't have any friends. Or at
least no friends who had the kind of clout that a Soc or a Grease might have.

Or should we take as a model for the sociological interaction of these groups a more complex analogy than The Outsiders? Perhaps what's really going
on is that poetry is like The Breakfast Club. There are Jocks and Princesses, Criminals, Freaks, Brains, Vice Principals and Janitors, and no matter
what you do, you are going to fall into one of these roles, yeah? A Jock is a pretty boy, a golden talent whose accolades and awards far outstrip the
measure of his accomplishments. Maya Angelou might be a Jock.

You can see where I'm going with this I suppose.

My only real point is that if you're given to these sorts of analyses, and seriously, who isn't? then there are "archetypes" or "roles" or "scripts"
for "transactional games" to be found everywhere. The only choice any of us really have is whether or not to participate in the community, and then,
once we do make that decision, what role we're going to take on or shall we strike out on our own and attempt to make a new mold for others to follow?
Which of course brings me back to the salient bit of my first question, which is, what is necessary to become involved in a community in the first
place? That's where i think a critical gaze ought to be turned to figure out why some get the credentials who don't seem to have gotten them for any
reason while others remain uncredentialed and ignored; even by Ally Sheedy and Anthony Michael Hall.

Ever since the mention of this book i have had relentlessly stuck in my head
the Joe South mega-hit song "Games  People Play" from same period as the
book. (The twangy guitar lead and solo esp haunting me--and the chorus
dirving me nuts!)  "Talkin' 'bout/you an' me/and the games people play"
     I've never read the book--at the time i recall reading a lot of Balzac
which is basically an incredible guide to the games people play and provided
fun references when observing these ever since.
     Gabe-as i recall weren't you recently writing of Buddhism?  The
judgementalism of the Bernian approach here seems at odds with the embrace
and acceptance of what i recal of your last letters.  There's got to be a
reason why hundreds of milions folllow Buddha everday and only place i ever
see Dr Berne is in the fly specked shelves of Salvation Army where decades
of psycho-babble fads go to meekly expire in the arms of old romance novels.
      BTW Joe South's other big hit was "Walk a Mile in My Shoes"
      He must not have been taken up on the offer--and walked off alone  in
them shoes--for he also dwelleth among the Salvation Army ranks.
       Actually I was just reading a book on one of the most important
mathematicians of the 20th century--Bourbaki--who in fact did not exist, but
was the published being of a group of mathematicians working together
anonymously.
Trying to get that song out of my head!

As a young poet I found it more comfortable to remain on the outskirts of
what I found to be the most vital poetry community of my era, the New York
School. I felt shy about putting my writing forth anyway, and I found the
atmosphere among these poets somewhat off-putting; yet, after
some years I went the usual route of joining workshops. I had the good
fortune (maybe) to earn the attention of a couple of my favorite
poets at that time,  and after many years of relative reticence, my
work started to gain some notice. I published my first poem in 1965;
my first book in 1988.

My experience as a participant in various poetry communities is not that
different from that of working in social work bureaucracies all my life. In
the long run nearly everyone understands who's who, in the sense of what
kind of person they actually are, whatever their career strategy or
positioning might be or appear to be. You don't really have to advertise or
defend yourself that much. Whatever a few people might do to defame you
won't have much long run impact or make much difference; or, on the other
hand, whatever you do to promote yourself, beyond making your work as
available for others to read, will have about the same result. It is
foolish, of course, to isolate oneself from the debates, and participating
in this list, weblogging, etc, I find generally helpful. Nevertheless, it
hurts to be put down, and poets, especially the males, nearly all
participate in the team sport behavior of getting the most points for
themselves that they can, while trying to sideline the competition. Ted
Berrigan has a funny poem in which he specifies, more or less accurately, it
seems to me, the negative attributes of a lot of poets he knew, and then
invites the reader to make their own list. You need a sense of humor to deal
with this stuff, although I find it is not always immediately at hand,
unfortunately. I've long been fascinated by and drawn to artistic circles,
and have equally long remained more or less ambivalent about them.

As to Simon DeDeo's point about the critique of "official verse culture" put
forth by Charles Bernstein, I was surprised to find, walking to the 42cd
Street Library the other day, an elaborate sidewalk plaque devoted to Robert
Pinsky along with those of, among others, Samuel Beckett, Emily Dickenson
and William Carlos Williams. In my many decades of reading poetry, I had
never heard of Mr. Pinksy before learning that he head been appointed Poet
Laureate some years back.

The recent books I've found the most useful in concerning cultural behavior
are: Libbie Rifkin's *Career Moves* and now, Morris Berman's
*Dark Ages America: The Final Phase of Empire*. Other suggestions?

david-baptiste and nick, thanks for your gentle replies.

david-baptiste, you mention a few things in your post.

first, you note that eric berne's book is found in old stores and stuff.
berne's influence on contemporary american culture, both through
professional psychology and among laypeople, was incredibly influential.
transactional analysis basically supplanted freudian analysis. kurt
vonnegut in the nytimes sd of berne's 1964 book, which is, y're right,
still found everywhere, including university offices and thrift stores,
42 yrs after publication: "This is an important book -- if not to
scientists, then to laypeople in their anguished need for simple clues
as to what is really going on. It also fricassees the canard that a
novelist or playwright, with his magic intuition, can reveal more about
life than any physician could ever know."

second, you mentioned buddhism. i know very little about it, not being a
buddhist myself. but i do read and heed what the buddha actually said
and did. if you go on any long vipassana retreats, or read any of the
suttanta, the suttas, or any of the vinaya pitaka, the code of conduct
for monks and nuns, or for that matter the code of conduct for
laypeople, you notice that the buddha was a tough cookie, socially,
politically, psychologically. and tho he did not propound a political
position or a social philosophy, he was very much about moral conduct
and about increasing one's ability, via the cultivation of insight
through a series of gradually deepening experiences, to discern right
from wrong, lies from truth -- in oneself and others -- so that one's
own actions and the actions of one's community start out moral and
become increasingly filled with lovingkindness. the ultimate purpose of
which is to take an active, very active, engagement in the affairs of
human beings (and in fact all beings). not to shrink back away from them.

he was not, in other words, a "go-along" kind of guy, nor was he a
pacifist, tho those are common misconceptions; he was instead someone
who very much promoted taking a hard stand when necessary in a
nonviolent fashion. anyone who has suffered in the presence of
manipulative behavior knows what a joy it is to be able to identify it,
name it if necessary, and calmly to remove oneself from it. it is a
common misconception about his teaching and practice that one doesn't
have to discern whether oneself and others are mendacious, false, etc.
not sure if that's what you were getting at, so forgive me if i
misgauged my response.

and that song in your head, brother, will eventually stop. :)

nick, paul fleischman's *Cultivating Inner Peace* is (if you don't let
the title trip you up) useful reading. am also looking forward to joe
amato's *Industrial Poetics: Demo Tracks for a Mobile Culture,* having
just read his *Under Virga* (Chax 2006).

warmly,
gabe (found on page 38)

Gabriel, I think you are being a little disingenuous here! Particularly in
part on account of both your large reading and vispassana practice of - I
believe you said - of now about 20 years.
I have not done the reading, but I have done the practice - including the
retreats for the past several years. Yet, I - and the practitioners that
practice with - would never say, "I am a Buddhist." In my experience, the
focus is always on the "practice" (the presence of the process) and the
teacher. Vipassana is one form of Buddist practice. (For some, the attention
of playing basketball might be another, or mountain climbing, or quilting
or, why not, the the attention and process of making a poem - yet, these,
too, are only fractions/manifestations of a much larger space/spaciousness.
Each of which - depending on the concentration of the practitioner - may or
may be informed and guided by the teaching of the teachings of the Buddha -
as you well define in what follows:

>but i do read and heed what the buddha actually said

I suspect what is obnoxious or false about the statement, "I am a Buddhist"
is that it suggests there is a container (Buddha) that one can enter,  find
a home, and worship this figure as a God, instead of a person who was
primarily a teacher (and a very pragmatic one- as you point out -  at that.)

So what does one say? "I am engaged in one of many Buddhist practices (x
kind meditation) the teachings as handed down from a man called Buddha."

Suspect a life of example is more illuminating and persuasive than most
definitions.

Yes, the lives of practitioners (no matter the form of practice) also
abounds with histories of contrary vices.

Shout-out to Ishaq for his last posting; though I've found
the occasional stridency of your posts a little hard on my
ears, I want to thank you for the recent treasure trove of
links for two reasons.  First, you've reminded me to add a
bit on hip hop poetry for my book on WAR RESISTANCE POETRY
shortly forthcoming, and second, for the link that cleared
up the mystery of who killed Ghassan Kanafani (by car
bombing in 1973), the great Palestinian writer.  There was
some question whether he was killed by a Palestinian faction
(he was part of the PFLP) or by Israeli agents.  Turns out
it was the Israelis.  I'm going to go home and re-read "Men
in the Sun," his great novella about the Palestinian
situation.  Incidentally, he also coined the
term "resistance literature," later picked up by Barbara
Harlow in her examination of postcolonial literature of
struggle.

hi stephen,

tho i appreciate your pressing the point about "buddhism" and vipassana,
and whether i am or amn't this or that, i think this is off the thread
topic and possibly not the space to talk about this stuff. but as it's
an important subject, here goes: the buddha sd over and over again that
he only taught "dhamma," which is a word that could be translated as
"reality." so for those who, like me, shy away from religion and
religious concerns, understand that the word "dhamma," acc to the
suttas, neither connotes nor denotes anything religious. nor was the
buddha's teaching a religion. "buddhism" per se was invented later.
the buddha taught a method of emancipation from unhappiness -- and he
made a point of being keenly secular.

he taught dhamma, not buddhism. others later made it into something full
of rites and rituals, romanticizing the practice of meditation into
various "sudden awakening" systems etc.

quite simply, "dhamma" is a secular term which references a moral system
and an experiential training in what could loosely be called an "art of
living," in the ancient tradition of the Ars Vivendi. it's just a
"funny" word to describe something quite powerful in its efficacy. if
practiced.

that was my only point about that.

as regards whether vipassana is like basketball, quilting, etc:
vipassana is a unique and specific practice for purifying the mind and
heart. its effects are unique -- and its practice is distinct from all
other human activities that i'm aware of. certainly people can get
benefit from the activities you mention, but the benefits from vipassana
are exceptional, but that is not to say that people don't discover it on
their own: people do discover the method of vipassana on their own. i
think certain athletes especially (lance armstrong, say) are inclined
"discover" a rigorous method of self-awareness and equanimity akin to
vipassana -- and i think that people who deal with great physical pain
and discomfort are more likely to discover it on their own. the buddha
himself said he "re-discovered" it as a practice.

i've only been practicing it seriously for three years, tho i was first
introduced to it in 1991: i could not keep the base of morality and
moral conduct necessary to practice it until 2002.

warmly,
gabe

Sabotage
by E. POUGET


1. Origin of Sabotage

ORIGIN OF SABOTAGE. ITS EARLY APPEARANCE. BALZAC ON SABOTAGE. THE
ENGLISH "GO CANNY". BAD WAGES, BAD WORK. NEW HORIZONS. PANIC AMONGST THE
BOSSES. AN IMPRESSING DECLARATION. AN EPOCH-MAKING DISCUSSION AT THE
CONGRESS OF THE C.G.T. TRIUMPHANT ENTRANCE OF SABOTAGE IN FRANCE.

UP to fifteen years ago the term SABOTAGE as nothing but a slang word,
not meaning "to make wooden shoes" as it may be imagined but, in a
figurative way. TO WORK CLUMSILY AS IF BY SABOT (1) BLOWS.
Since then the word was transformed into a new form of social warfare
and at the Congress of Toulouse of the General Confederation of Labor in
1897 received at last its syndical baptism. The new term was not at
first accepted by the working class with the warmest enthusiasm - some
even saw it with mistrust, reproaching it not only for its humble origin
but also its - immorality.

Nevertheless, despite all these prejudices which seemed almost
hostilities, SABOTAGE went steadily on its way around the world. It has
now the full sympathy of the workers.

More still, it has secured its rights of citizenship in the Larousse (2)
and there is no doubt that the Academy (unless it is itself "saboted"
before arriving at the letter S of its dictionary) will have to bow to
the word SABOTAGE its most ceremonious curtsey and open to it the pages
of its official sanctum.

However, it would be a mistake to believe that the working class waited
to apply sabotage until this new weapon of economic action had been
consecrated by the confederation congress.

Sabotage as a form of revolt is as old as human exploitation.
Since the day a man had the criminal ability to profit by another man's
labour, since that very same day the exploited toiler has instinctively
tried to give to his master less than was demanded from him. In this
wise the worker was unconsciously doing SABOTAGE, demonstrating in an
indirect way the irrepressible antagonism that arrays Capital and Labor
one against the other.

This unavoidable consequence of the conflict that divides society was
brought to light three quarters of a century ago by Balzac in his
"Maison Nucingen," apropos of the bloody riots of Lyons in 1831. He has
given us a clear and incisive definition of SABOTAGE.

"Much has been said," writes Balzac, "of the Lyons revolt and of the
Republic shot down in the streets but nobody has said the truth. The
Republic had seized the movement just as a rebel seizes a gun. The
commerce of Lyons is a commerce without courageÃ£it does not manufacture
an ounce of silk without its being demanded and promptly paid for. When
the demand is low the worker starves - when he works he has barely
enough to live on. The galley slaves are happier than he is.

"After the July revolution, poverty had reached such a stage that the
workers raised a flag with this motto: Bread or Death - a flag which the
government should have seriously considered. Instead of that, Lyons
wanted to build theatres to become a capital - hence a senseless
squandering of money.

"The republicans smelled through the increasing misery the coming revolt
and organised the spinners who fought a double battle. Lyons had its
three days, then order prevailed again and the beggar went back to his
kennel.

"The spinner who had up to then transformed into threads the silk that
was weighed to him in cocoons, put fairness out of the door and began to
oil his fingers. Of course, he gave back with fastidious scrupulosity
the exact weightÃ£but the silk was all stained with oil and the silk
market was thus infested with defective merchandise which could have
caused the ruin of Lyons and the loss of a goodly share of the French
commerce.

Balzac had been careful to bring out that the spinners' sabotage was
nothing but a reprisal of victims. By putting oil in the spindles the
workers were getting even with the heartless manufacturers who had
promised them bayonets to eat instead of bread and had so lavishly kept
their promise.

Indeed, when isn't an act of sabotage the equivalent and consequence of
a suffered wrong?

Isn't perhaps in the origin and causes of each act of sabotage revealed
the capitalist exploitation which often reaches to cruelty?
And this reaction against exploitation, in whatever condition it
manifests itself, isn't it even too an attitude or action of revoltÃ£
whatever form it may take? And here we are brought back to our
affirmation that sabotage is as old as human exploitation.

Neither must it be believed that sabotage is a product with a Parisian
trade mark. It is, indeed, if anything, a theory of English importation
and it has been practiced across the Channel for a long time under the
name of "Go Cannie" - a Scotch expression which means literally "Go slow."

An example of the persuasive efficiency of the "Go Cannie" is given by
the periodical, "The Social Museum":

"In 1889 the Glasgow dockers went on strike asking an increase of two
cents an hour.

"The contractors and stevedores flatly refused and imported at great
expense a considerable number of farm hands to take the place of the
strikers, with the conclusion that the dockers had to give up the fight
and return to work on the same conditions.

"Just before resuming work their general secretary gathered them once
again and said: 'Boys, you must go back today on the same scale of wages
prevailing before.

"The contractors have expressed and repeated all their satisfaction for
the work done by the farmers who have scabbed on us during these last
weeks. We have seen them at work and know full well what kind of
satisfactory work was theirs Ã£ we saw indeed that they could not even
keep their balance on the bridges and saw how they dropped in the sea
half the cargo they loaded and unloaded. In one word, we have seen that
two of them could not do as much work as one of us. Nevertheless, the
bosses said they were satisfied with their labour, therefore, we have
one thing left yet; let us give them the same kind of labour. Work then
just like the farm hands did Ã£ they often pushed their incapacity to the
point of falling overboard, but it is not necessary for you to do this,
of course."

These instructions were scrupulously followed, and the dockers applied
the "Go Cannie" theory to the point. After a few days the contractors
called the general secretary of the longshoremen and begged him to
induce the dockers to work the same as before, declaring themselves
ready to grant the two cents increase.

Passing from a practical to a theoretical example. It is interesting to
quote a few pages from an English pamphlet published in 1895 for the
purpose of popularising the "Go Cannie."

"If you want to buy a hat worth $2.00 you must pay $2.00. If you want to
spend only $1.50 you must be satisfied with an inferior quality. A hat
is a commodity. If you want to buy half a dozen of shirts at fifty cents
each you must pay $3.00. If you want to spend only $2.50 you can only
have five shirts.

"Now the bosses declare that labour and skill are nothing but
commodities, like hats and shirts.
"Very well - we answer - we'll take you at your word. If labour and
skill are commodities, their owners have a right to sell them like the
hatter sells hats and the haberdasher sells shirts. These merchants give
a certain value in exchange for an equivalent value. For the lower price
you will have an article of either a lower quality or a smaller
quantity. Give the worker a fair wage and he will furnish you his best
labour at its highest skill.

"On the other hand, give the worker an insufficient wage and you forfeit
your right to demand the best and the most of his labour, any more than
you can demand a two dollar hat for one dollar."

The "Go Cannie" consists then in systematically applying the formula:
"Bad wages, bad labour." Not only that. From this formula there are
derived, as a logical consequence, various manifestations of the
proletarian will in conflict with the capitalist.

This tactic, which is today widely diffused in England, where it has
been advocated and practiced by the labour organisations, could not
delay long to cross the Channel and establish itself in France - as it
cannot delay to cross the Alps and expand from France to Italy.
Accordingly, shortly after 1889 we find its first manifestation in France.

The National Railwaymen's Union was at the time engaged in a campaign
against the Merlin Trarieux Railway bill which aimed at depriving the
railway workers of their right to unite.

The question of answering with the general strike to the passing of the
bill was being discussed. Guerard, secretary of the Railwaymen's Union,
delivered a categorical and precise speech. He affirmed that the
Railwaymen would not stop at any means to defend their syndical liberty
and made allusion to an ingenious and cheap method of combat.

"With two cents worth of a certain ingredient, utilised in a peculiar
way" - he declared - "it will be easy for the Railwaymen to put the
locomotives in such a condition as to make it impossible to run them."
This clear and blunt affirmation, which was opening new and unforeseen
fields of struggle, raised a great roar and a deep commotion in the
ranks of the employers and the government, which were already
perceiving, not without terror, the consequences of a general strike of
the railway workers.
If, however, with the declaration of Guerard, the question of Sabotage
was openly confronted, it would not be exact to assume that it had been
practiced in France before then.

To prove this it suffices to recall the typical example of a "trick"
which has remained famous in telegraphic centres. Towards 1881, the
operators of the central office, dissatisfied with the wage scale for
night overtime, sent up a petition to the minister of Post and
Telegraphs 70 of that time, M. Cochery, asking for ten francs instead of
five which they were then paid for work ranging from six p. m. to seven
a. m. They vainly waited a few days for an answer from the
administration, and having been informed that it would never come, a
sullen agitation and anger began to circulate amongst them.
A strike being impossible, they resorted to a trick.

One fine morning Paris awoke to find out that all telegraphic
connections were cut off. (Telephones had not yet been installed.) This
continued for four or five days.

The higher personnel of the administration, with engineers and numerous
squads of foremen and mechanics invaded the central office to inspect
minutely every apparatus, battery wire, etc., from the front door to the
cellar, but, strange enough, they could not find the cause of the trouble.

Five days after this memorable and wonderful "accident," a notice from
the administration informed the operators that from that day on the
night service would be paid ten francs instead of five.

They had not asked for more. "The next day all the lines were again
buzzing as by magic. The authors of the miraculous trick were never
found out by the administration which, if it guessed the motive, was
never able to guess the means employed." (3)

The die was now cast.

"Sabotage," which up to that time had been applied unconsciously and
instinctively by the workers, with the popular name which has remained
attached to it begins in 1895 to receive its baptism, its theoretical
consecration and to take its place amongst the other means of social
warfare, recognised, approved, advocated and practiced by the labour
unions.

Canadian Police put the Economic Squeeze on Six Nations Commerce

author: repost by fireweed of article by Kahentinetha Horn


How do you repress a protest? Canadian police try a novel tactic:
cracking down on the tribally owned businesses and people travelling
with locally produced goods. The excuse? Indigenous business and trade
is "the new organized crime". Hey Canadian government- start putting the
handcuffs on yourself! Systematic treaty violation is a bigger
"organized crime" than a few Native tobacco products!
THE "ECONOMIC PYTHON" - CANADA AND ONTARIO CONTINUE TO COIL THEMSELVES
AROUND THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE! WHAT IS THE "OWISTA" DISEASE?



MNN. Aug. 31, 2006. Two young Indigenous men told us a story about their
recent run-ins with the Ontario Provincial police OPP. They are both
from two Indigenous communities in southwestern Ontario. They were both
arrested in an Indigenous community in southeastern Ontario by the
Indian police for carrying Indigenous-made cigarets from one Indigenous
community into another.



Previously our people were charged under the Federal Excise & Customs
acts only. Then about one month ago Canada and Ontario put the "squeeze"
on our people. We are now being charged under both the federal act and
the Ontario Tobacco Tax Act. Canada catches us in the Indigenous
communities, fines us and puts us in jail. Then Ontario gets a civil
judgment under their law and goes after our assets. The province puts a
much higher fine on us. They also can seize our cars and money in our
bank accounts that are outside our communities. This is in blatant
violation of the original promises that claimed that we would be able to
move about on our land as before if we let Europeans settle here.



As far as we know cigarets can be transported from one Indigenous
community to another. These guys were arrested in the Indigenous
community. Several days ago one of them was pulled over in Akwesasne.
Though it was legal, the Akwesasne Police officer said the cigarets were
not allowed in the community. The store this man was delivering to
belongs to the police officer's aunt. She can receive and sell the
cigarets, but the man can't deliver! Does that make sense?



Welcome to freedom and democracy in Canada. This is what colonial Canada
is doing to us because we have backed them into a corner demanding they
obey the law and return our stolen land and resources back to us.



We are being attacked financially. The RCMP, the OPP, the Customs and
the Indigenous police are working together. These authorities are
purporting that funds from cigarets are supporting the Six Nations
reclamation, as if our trade is illegal. When they claim that we are
being financial by "organized crime", they are referring to the cigaret
trade. Fair is fair. They should acknowledge that their mines, clear cut
logging and other industries that have destroyed our environment are
also criminal.



This strategy is meant to choke us economically so we will give up our
struggle for our lands and possessions and to starve us into submission.
As if it was possible for anyone to return to the 19th century
economically! Right now it's the one million acres of the Haldimand
Tract of southern Ontario. Next, the rest of Canada! When these
corporate government entities are finished with us, it will be ordinary
Canadian citizens next.



The anti-Indian hatred being spun by the politicians like Toby Barrett
and others in the corporate media prohibits us from getting jobs in the
dominant communities. All the branding against "Indians" in the
mainstream media by government is meant to make us all look like
terrorists, smugglers, criminals, thieves and good for nothings. In
other words, to them we are not human beings! This demonizing makes
getting a job outside of our communities very difficult. Prospective
employers think, "How can we trust him or her. He/she's an Indian".



A government agent recently informed the Mohawks of Tyendinaga that,
"Your are stealing from us by not collecting taxes for us from your
non-native customers". The reply was, "Who says they're your taxes!
Tobacco is indigenous to Turtle Island just like us". The agent walked
out. Why should we collect taxes for them anyway? They don't collect
taxes for us for the occupation of our land. They have the gall to claim
possession of the land of which we are trustees for future generations.



Indigenous businesses are under pressure to close down. Both federal and
provincial agencies are ganging up on us. They may have gotten rid of
the section of the illegal Indian Act that made it illegal for us to
hire lawyers to defend us. But they haven't stopped trying to deprive us
of the means to pay for them, should we want to use them, or even for
the food we need to survive during our struggles. If they catch the
Indigenous person on or off the rez in a car or a van, they are
arrested. If the cops find any cigarettes that have not been branded
with a yellow band showing their alien taxes have been paid, the
"Indians" are arrested. If convicted they will owe the value of the
taxes, the costs, the legal expenses and maybe even jail time.



The courts put as much as $150,000 in fines on our young people. The
federal government collects as much as it can from these young people in
order to stay out of jail. In 1738 the King of England issued an order
to his governors on Turtle Island that they will deal with the "Indians"
through "economic weaponry". That's when our medicine men coined the
disease of the mind as "owista", where priority of the mind goes from
"we" to "I". Today the word "owista" is used by the Mohawks to mean
"money". The only cure for this disease is the Kaianereh'ko:wa/Great Law
philosophy. Owista in corporate society allows a few elite individuals
to survive without social support. Just think about what kind of society
needs this kind of instrument. It's a society that does not care for its
own. A lot of the world suffers from this disease now.



If our young people don't hand over buckets and buckets of this alien
voodoo owista, they end up in jail according to some bureaucratic
formula, which could be up to 2 years. The young people being terrorized
in this way are often fathers of young children. Imprisoning them and
giving them a record prevents them from fulfilling their duties to the
women, to their families and to their elders. It creates serious
psychological problems and compounds the consequences of the harm that
we have already experienced. The colonial system set this up as a way to
trap us into their policing and welfare system. It's always their hope
that our young people will become druggies, alcoholic, people who have
given up and suicidal. It's the modern methodology of genocide.



The Indigenous people who are trying to run businesses in their
communities are deemed to be in unfair competition with the outsiders.
This is the "turn the settlers against us" strategy. The customers from
outside are pressured and threatened if they buy from us. For example,
at Tyendinaga, a customer buying lumber from an Indigenous hardware
store owner will be visited by inspectors and pressured into paying
taxes. They will pay it because they're scared that their house will be
confiscated or torn down.



The band councils can only hire so many people. The rest of us have to
fend for ourselves. This is the hierarchical/patriarchal system that has
been imposed on us. Those of us who start little cigaret shops or stores
to feed our children are targeted as competing with non-Indian vendors
in the area. The local vendors start pressuring their local Member of
Parliament accusing us of having an unfair advantage. "We have to shut
them down", they scream. Our businesses are constantly being threatened
with closure. We are not sure how to fight this. This is economic
terrorism by the federal and provincial governments.



The worst part is when a young Indigenous person in high school starts
looking towards their future. Colonial society shows us there is no hope
or jobs out there because we're "Indians". Most of our businesses are
harassed. If they want to work in the United States, President Bush and
others don't want any of these "Canadian terrorists" to come in. We're
not Canadian and never will be. We're not terrorists and never will be.
But the colonial administrations are doing their best to terrorize us!



This strategy is meant to strangle the Indigenous people economically.
When we claim our legitimate rights, the federal and provincial
governments go overboard. Any two-bit bureaucrat thinks that "Indians"
are fair game. Is it being engineered by some master mind in some secret
war room in Toronto or Ottawa? Who is the current Duncan Campbell Scott,
the butcher of the Indigenous people of the past? Is there only one or
has he been cloned?



Someone at the top has planned to put the screws around us and tighten
each one by shutting off our finances so we can't make a living. Prime
Minister Stephen Harper has warned band councils, "If you don't play
ball, your finances for education are going to be gradually cut". Hey,
we'll be fine. Just give us the back rent you owe us for Ontario!



The whole idea is to economically deprive the Indigenous people so that
it will weaken our resolve to make Canada live up to the laws that
Canada has already signed both with us and in international venues. They
want us to stop exerting pressure to assert our right to our lands and
resources.



According to Louise Arbour, the Chief Prosecutor of War Crimes before
the International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague. The Prime Minister of
Canada and the Premier of Ontario can be charged and prosecuted for
genocide. What they are doing is certainly not as bloody as Slobodon
Milosovic who mass slaughtered his victims in Kosovo. But does the fact
that the slaughter of Indigenous people is slow and discreet make it any
less reprehensible?



We remind these vicious colonial serpent heads that putting the squeeze
on us will backfire on you. Turtle Island is ours. Every attack on us
will endanger you, Canada.

Reading too quickly, I parsed this as "Pinsky has ended as a *plague*."

Hollywood Supports Israeli Mass Murder
Friday August 18th 2006, 1:45 pm

“Nicole Kidman has made a public stand against terrorism,” reports the
Herald Sun. “The actress, joined by 84 other high-profile Hollywood
stars, directors, studio bosses and media moguls, has taken out a
powerfully-worded full page advertisement in today’s Los Angeles Times
newspaper.”

It specifically targets “terrorist organizations” such as Hezbollah in
Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine.

“We the undersigned are pained and devastated by the civilian casualties
in Israel and Lebanon caused by terrorist actions initiated by terrorist
organizations such as Hezbollah and Hamas,” the ad reads.

“If we do not succeed in stopping terrorism around the world, chaos will
rule and innocent people will continue to die.

“We need to support democratic societies and stop terrorism at all costs.”

In addition to Kidman, Michael Douglas, Dennis Hopper, Sylvester
Stallone, Bruce Willis, Danny De Vito, Don Johnson, James Woods, Kelly
Preston, Patricia Heaton and William Hurt signed the ad, as did
directors Ridley Scott, Tony Scott, Michael Mann, Dick Donner and Sam
Raimi. “Other Hollywood powerplayers supporting the ad included Sumner
Redstone, the chairman and majority owner of Paramount Pictures, and
billionaire mogul, Haim Saban.”

Of course, we cannot expect pampered Hollywood actors, directors, and
studio moguls to know jack about the situation in Lebanon or Palestine,
not anymore than the average American, tuned in to Fox News and CNN,
knows anything about the facts behind Israel’s invasion of Lebanon.

As we know, that is if we pay attention, Israel’s invasion was planned
over a year ago, as the San Francisco Chronicle reported. “More than a
year ago, a senior Israeli army officer began giving PowerPoint
presentations, on an off-the-record basis, to U.S. and other diplomats,
journalists and think tanks, setting out the plan for the current
operation in revealing detail.”

As Seymour Hersh writes in the current issue of the New Yorker, the
“Bush Administration … was closely involved in the planning of Israel’s
retaliatory attacks. President Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney were
convinced, current and former intelligence and diplomatic officials told
me, that a successful Israeli Air Force bombing campaign against
Hezbollah’s heavily fortified underground-missile and
command-and-control complexes in Lebanon could ease Israel’s security
concerns and also serve as a prelude to a potential American preëmptive
attack to destroy Iran’s nuclear installations, some of which are also
buried deep underground.”

In other words, Israel’s brutal invasion was deemed a dry run for a
future attack against Iran, no matter that, in essence, Hezbollah
defeated Israel and, obviously, Iran would resist any such shock and awe
campaign rather successfully and make big trouble for the U.S.
occupation in Iraq.

“The Israelis told us it would be a cheap war with many benefits,” a
U.S. government consultant with close ties to Israel told Hersh. “Why
oppose it? We’ll be able to hunt down and bomb missiles, tunnels, and
bunkers from the air. It would be a demo for Iran.”

Kidman, Willis, Douglas, Hopper, and the rest cannot be expected to
understand the true nature of Hezbollah, a nature diametrically opposed
to the corporate media version of the resistance group. For instance, we
can assume with a great degree of accuracy that Nicole Kidman does not
know that Israel repeatedly crossed the Blue Line—that is to say, it
violated Lebanese sovereignty hundreds, if not more than a thousand
times—as it is obvious, by her signature on this advert, she does not
bother to read beyond corporate media headlines, if that. On the other
hand, she may be an ardent supporter of Zionist crimes against humanity.

“Since its withdrawal of occupation forces from southern Lebanon in May
2000, Israel has violated the United Nations-monitored ‘blue line’ on an
almost daily basis, according to UN reports,” writes Anders Strindberg
for the Christian Science Monitor. “Hizbullah’s military doctrine,
articulated in the early 1990s, states that it will fire Katyusha
rockets into Israel only in response to Israeli attacks on Lebanese
civilians or Hizbullah’s leadership; this indeed has been the pattern.”

In the process of its violations, Israel has terrorized the general
population, destroyed private property, and killed numerous civilians.
This past February, for instance, 15-year-old shepherd Yusuf Rahil was
killed by unprovoked Israeli cross-border fire as he tended his flock in
southern Lebanon. Israel has assassinated its enemies in the streets of
Lebanese cities and continues to occupy Lebanon’s Shebaa Farms area,
while refusing to hand over the maps of mine fields that continue to
kill and cripple civilians in southern Lebanon more than six years after
the war supposedly ended. What peace did Hizbullah shatter?

It is amazing the Christian Science Monitor, usually up there with the
worst of the corporate media, published Strindberg’s article. “Once the
Arabs had rejected the UN’s right to give away their land and to force
them to pay the price for European pogroms and the Holocaust, the
creation of Israel in 1948 was made possible only by ethnic cleansing
and annexation,” he continues. “This is historical fact and has been
documented by Israeli historians, such as Benny Morris. Yet Israel
continues to contend that it had nothing to do with the Palestinian
exodus, and consequently has no moral duty to offer redress.”

But then the pampered elite of Hollywood, far too busy shelling out
mindless pablum for multinational “entertainment” corporations, cannot
be bothered with historical facts. “Western discourse seems unable to
accommodate a serious, as opposed to cosmetic concern for Palestinians’
rights and liberties: The Palestinians are the Indians who refuse to
live on the reservation; the Negroes who refuse to sit in the back of
the bus,” writes Strindberg.

The fundamental obstacle to understanding the Arab-Israeli conflict is
that we have given up on asking what is right and wrong, instead asking
what is “practical” and “realistic.” Yet reality is that Israel is a
profoundly racist state, the existence of which is buttressed by a
seemingly endless succession of punitive measures, assassinations, and
wars against its victims and their allies.

A realistic understanding of the conflict, therefore, is one that
recognizes that the crux is not in this or that incident or policy, but
in Israel’s foundational and persistent refusal to recognize the
humanity of its Palestinian victims. Neither Hizbullah nor Hamas are
driven by a desire to “wipe out Jews,” as is so often claimed, but by a
fundamental sense of injustice that they will not allow to be forgotten.

“If we do not succeed in stopping terrorism around the world, chaos will
rule and innocent people will continue to die. We need to support
democratic societies and stop terrorism at all costs,” aver Kidman,
DeVito, Don Johnson, and 81 others.

Translation: if Israel and the United States do not endeavor mightily to
snuff out resistance to their diabolical plan to turn the Middle East
into a slave plantation and huge open-air prison, where millions of
Arabs and Muslims are reduced to pauperized “hewers of wood and drawers
of water,” innocent people will continue to die by way of depleted
uranium, white phosphorus and cluster bombs, and other illegal weapons.
Obviously, Kidman and crew are full square behind Israel’s ethnic
cleansing and the neocon push to kill thousands, if not millions of
Iranians and Syrians.

If this is not a reason to never again visit a multiplex cinema or rent
a DVD, I don’t know what is.

> Sabotage
> by E. POUGET

I'm not sure how much this is to the point of Ishaq's post, but not to let
it go ...

Ishaq is quoting from Emile Pouget +Sabotage+ (1910), in a translation by
Arturo  Giovannitti in 1913:

       http://www.eclipse.net/~basket42/agsab2.html

My problem (as a Scot brought up in Glasgow) is with this:

      ---  "Go Cannie" - a Scotch expression which means literally "Go
slow." ---

The phrase isn't Scots and it doesn't mean "Go slow".

        The phrase, in +Sabotage+, seems to de describing something between
what would later come to be called either the go-slow or work-to-rule union
strategies.

        "Caw cannie" is the Scots expression which lies behind this.  From
"ca", go, and "cannie", cautious or careful.  Originally it meant "Act
cautiously" (early 19thC), but in the later 19thC it developed a specialised
poitical meaning -- "Ca'canny" -- which Pouget describes.

        I don't think the form "Go cannie" was ever used -- it doesn't make
any linguistic sense, one bit being English and the other Scots, as I'm sure
David Kirkwood, the one authentic docker among the leaders of the ILP in
Glasgow at the time, would have pointed-out.

        I don't know how widespread the political meaning of "ca cannie"
was -- certainly nowhere near as widespread as the original one (I had to
chase it in the OED, and even went to the SLD as I was still surprised by
what I found.), certainly nowhere near as common as the original "go
cautiously", which is still in use.  (I've been known to come out with it
myself, chiding the weans when they did something too risky for thir ain
guid.)

        I wonder, too, how much it ran outside newspaper reports?  And where
the original mistake comes from -- Pouget, or his original American
translator Giovannitti.? The idea of Glasgow dockers solemnly discussing
their pay rates in terms of cents and dollars I found mildly incongruous.

        I originally thought it must be a conflation of "Ca Cannie" and "Go
slow", but the dates don't fit here, as "go slow" as term for an industrial
technique isn't recorded in the OED till 1930.  Might have existed before,
but it's way after the 1890s.

        "Work to rule" (a slightly different spin on the same method) is the
latest to be recorded in the OED, linked back to "ca'canny":

OED2(3)  --  WORK, v

27d. to work to rule: to follow the rules of one's occupational duties
punctiliously in order to reduce efficiency, usu. as a form of protest in an
industrial dispute. So work-to-rule attrib. phr.; also as n. Similarly, in
the professions, work-to-contract.

[1940 Ann. Reg. 1939 310 A â€˜ca' cannyâ€™ movementâ€”called â€˜work to rulesâ€™â€”among
the [railway] employees.]   1950 Ann. Reg. 1949 40 The delegates replied by
ordering a general work-to-rule 44-hour week .. unless claims were settled.

        Interesting that +Sabotage+ is written in 1910, about the time that
the Glasgow workers were coalescing around the ILP (Independent Labour
Party -- marxist but non-communist) and the city gained the nickname "Red
Clyde".

        The leader was John McLean, first soviet consul to the UK (running
the consulate from a Glasgow tenement), and others heavily involved were
James Maxton (schoolteacher, and author of a biography of Lenin), William
Gallagher, and David Kirkwood, head of the Clydeside dockers' union.
(Emmanuel Shinwell was also involved, but that's a name that's generally
avoided in favour of turning the head to one side and spitting.)

        It all ended in tears, of course, with the ILP digested by the
(official) Labour Party in the twenties.  Kirkwood, a good union organiser
and a decent man, crossed over and had a long and successful career as an
Official Labour Party MP, John McLean went mad after a spell in prison,
William Maxton just sort of faded away, and Willie Gallagher formally joined
the Communist Party.  He was one of only two MPs ever elected on the CP
ticket (there were, curiously enough,. more in the Lords) and held his seat
as a communist till the fifties, when he retired.

        Those were the days ...

i guess my only reply is that since i ain't dead yet, i still may have

peace bruh, sis & tovarish,

there was controversy about the "Hezbollah leader calls for â€˜united
front against imperialismâ€™" interview

orginally published here: http://www.emep.org/docs/press/nasral.html

after the workers world released the piece (the workers world later
withdrew the article) b.u.t. the message is so similar to the hez posse
and nasrallah's objectives the confusion was understandable.

"Hezbullah is a social, political, educational, medical and military
organization based primarily among the Shiâ€™a of Lebanon....it has set up
over 50 hospitals; it has set up over 100 schools (secular schools
primarily) and many libraries; it has participated in the governing of
Lebanon in the parliament and in the life of the country; it has driven
the Israelis out of southern Lebanon and kept them outâ€”to this day, it
is the force that stands guard against another Israeli invasion of
Lebanon." --  sam hamod -- "Understanding Hezbullah of Lebanon for What
it Really Is"

i send this correction out because, althtough it does not take from the
objectives of the hezbullah crew and posse's fight against imperialism
and the zionist regeme = racism, nor deminishes the support the
resistance has recieved from around the world, including from hugo
chavez (who dismissed the iraeli consulate see: "Venezuela withdraws
Israel ambassador")

"The Israeli elite repeatedly criticise Hitler's actions against the
Jews, and indeed Hitler's actions must be criticised, not just against
the Jews but against the world. It's also fascism what Israel is doing
to the Palestinian people ... terrorism and fascism."

nor does it take away from the brave stand that toronto liberal mp borys
wrzesnewskyj took by visiting lebanon after the zionist regemes murder
of over a thousand lebonanese citzens (which encluded an entire canadian
family) returned to make make the statement;

"Over 1,200 dead and counting. Over 40,000 apartments and houses
flattened. A country's infrastructure dismembered. You look around
here," said Wrzesnewskyj (Etobicoke Centre). "I believe what's happened
is absolutely criminal." -- "Direct talks with Hezbollah urged MPs tour

it is important, still being in solidarity with a righteous crew of the
hez -- that this correction is submitted -- i/we (as nation of bruhs and
sis/comrads in struggle) would not want to use black ops/zionists
tactricks of achieving an end by "way of deception".


Thursday, August 31, 2006
The matter has been settled. Today, Hizbullah issued an official
statement in which it categorically denied the "Turkish" interview with
Nasrallah that was posted on Counterpunch. The official statement is
printed below. The Anatolian News agency has issued a similar report in
English of the denial (thanks to Assaad and Gabriele).

however, fam, this is authentic;


"Now, as for my words for the resistance fighters, for my dear and
beloved brothers: upon them rest the hopes of every Lebanese, every
Palestinian, every Arab, every Muslim, every free and decent person in
this world, every oppressed, tortured victim of injustice, every lover
of steadfastness, courage, dignity, values, and nobility â€” the
characteristics they embody by their presence on the field of battle and
in their fight with this enemy, the fight of valiant heroes. I say to
them: today, after God the Highest, you are the hope of our Nation. You
are the symbol of our nobility. Our honor is in your hands...." --

and


The racial discrimination towards the blacks is still persisting in
every aspect. Moreover, there is a racial discrimination towards the Red
Indians who are the original inhabitants of the country. ...I tell you
frankly that if it wasn't for the determined willingness, ... and fight
of the Palestinian people, the Americans and their civilization would
have decided to solve that problem of...Palestinians just like they did
with the Indians. This is the picture that lies in the mind of the
American." --Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah

Whoever said Conscious Hip Hop artists canï¿½t get down or that Hip Hop
from the NY (East Coast) is dead simply has not tapped into the
burgeoning cultural inspired rap scene that has everyone from dead prez
to Immortal Technique making noise. Alongside them are artists like
Hasan Salaam, Hicoup and Akir just to name a few. We sat down with them
the other day when they swung through Oakland for the Strength in Words
Tour.

I gotta be honest it was nice building with these cats. In fact we
barely spoke about their projects, which include Hasanï¿½s ï¿½Lost Paradiseï¿½
album, Hicoupâ€™s Ghetto Factory Supremeï¿½ mixtape and Akirï¿½s debut LP
ï¿½Legacyï¿½. Instead we talked in depth about the Middle East including the
conflict in Lebanon. This was critically important especially when you
take into account that Hasan has a song on his album called "Hezbollah".

"In the Middle East, after a month of Israeli bombing, the people of
Lebanon are digging themselves out from the rubble and struggling to
return to their homes. In the United States, a full year after Hurricane
Katrina, the people of New Orleans are still fighting to do the same
thing: return home. It might seem odd to compare the two. After all,
Lebanon is recovering from war, and New Orleans from a natural disaster
and broken levees. But this is only the superficial story. A look at the
New Orleans relief effort and its aftermath shows that poor peopleâ€™s
right to return home has become just as much a battle there as it is in
Lebanon. In the United States, the New Orleans relief effort was
spearheaded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washingtonâ€™s
disaster relief arm. In Lebanon it is being organized by Hezbollah, the
grassroots Lebanese resistance movement that George W. Bush calls
â€œterrorist.â€  -- joyce chediac  -- "Lebanon rebuilds, New Orleans waits"

resistance due to the blatant censorship of the big business media.
Therefore, Workers World is reprinting excerpts from an Aug. 14
interview with Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah that appeared in
its entirety on the Turkish Party of Labor website, www.emep.org. Roza
Cigdem Erdogan and Mutlu Sahin, reporters with the Turkish daily,
Evrensel, conducted the interview in Beirut.
>
> Turkish Daily: Israel had claimed its aim was to destroy Hezbollah in
the first days of the occupation of Lebanon. How ever, it came across a
resistance it did not expect and now it has been falling short of this
aim. Through violent clashes, the occupying army continues to suffer
heavy loses. But this is not covered sufficiently by the media.
>
> Hasan Nasrallah: They are writing that they are bombing the Hezbollah
positions and are deceiving the peoples. As you have witnessed
personally, this is a big lie! They are martyring the innocent
civilians. But, we are routing the Zionists wherever we come across
them. We are acting cautiously, and are not firing rockets on civilians.
By claiming that we are firing rockets on urban settlements, they are
seeking to deceive the peoples of the world. But we are firing rockets
under control on to locations we identified before. They are
deliberately driving the Israeli Arabs to the border. They are
presenting them as a target to us, but we are not playing into
provocation and mischief. Our target is not the civilians; it is the
Zionist military forces. Our fighters are routing extensively the
Zionist forces in the land operation. But they should also know that we
have still not used our important weapons. The Zionists, knowing that
they cannot daunt us with death, are attempting to destroy our
infrastructure, our roads, bridges, our women and children. This is how
they are trying to intimidate us. But, it is all futile, we will not
surrender! Apart from the freedom of our motherland, we will not accept
any other solution. We will resist and we will fight. Imperialism and
its Zionist contractors in the region should know that we are waiting
for the Zionists on every hill, every valley, every street and every
inch of our country. Our resistance necessitates victory. We have no
other way. This war will end with the victory of the oppressed of the
world and of the Muslims.
>
> Is it possible for Lebanon to face once again the threat of a civil war?
>
> Not only in Lebanon, but also in the region as a whole, the Zionist
regime is seeking polarization with the tension between ethnic groups,
sects and beliefs. Their strategy of attacking our country also confirms
this. But, the Hezbollah has spoiled this game. The oppressed peoples of
our country and of the Middle East have come to the defense of Hezbollah
and have provided their support. The socialists and Christians are
included in this.
>
> What is the current state of your relations with the socialist movement?
>
> The socialist movement, which has been away from international
struggle now for a considerable time, at last began to become a moral
support for us once again. The most concrete example of this has been
Hugo ChÃ¡vez, the president of Venezuela. What most of the Muslim states
could not do has been done by ChÃ¡vez by the withdrawal of their
ambassador to Israel. He furthermore com municated to us his support for
our resistance. This has been an immense source of morale for us. We can
observe a similar reaction within the Turkish Revolutionary Movement. We
had socialist brothers from Turkey who went to Palestine in the 1960s to
fight against Israel. And one of them still remains in my memory and my
heartâ€”Deniz Gezmis [founder of the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army of
Turkeyâ€”WW] ...!
>
> It is possible to see the posters of Che, ChÃ¡vez, Ahmadinejad and
Hezbollah side by side in the streets of Beirut. Are these the signs of
a new polarization?
>
> We salute the leaders and the peoples of Latin America. They have
resisted heroically against the American bandits and have been a source
of morale for us. They are guiding the way for the oppressed peoples. Go
and wander around our streets...! You will witness how our people have
embraced ChÃ¡vez and Ernesto Che Gue vara. Nearly in every house, you
will come across posters of Che or ChÃ¡vez. What we are saying to our
socialist friends who want to fight together with us for fraternity and
freedom, do not come at all if you are going to say religion is an
opiate. We do not agree with this analysis. Here is the biggest proof of
this in our streets with the pictures of ChÃ¡vez, Che, Sadr and Hamaney
waving along together. These leaders are saluting our people in unison.
So long as we respect your beliefs, and you respect ours, there is no
imperialist power we cannot defeat!
>
> Western governments are intensifying their pressure on Damascus and
Tehran for which they are proposing a change of regime. Some sources are
of the view that the attack on Lebanon will be directed on Syria. Is a
regional war possible?
>
> The centers of imperialist power want to make collaborators of our
region as a whole. They expect us to kneel before them. Syria, Iran and
we are opposing this. The provocation concerning the former Leba nese
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and the efforts to secure the withdrawal of
the Syrian army from Lebanon and going even further, their wish to
attack callously on to Tehran and Damascus are all due to this reason.
Syria, with Iran and Hezbollah will certainly resist this. The
imperialists of the west are seeking to make a second Kosovo out of
Lebanon and our region. They are seeking to create a clash between
sects. But we have spoiled this trick. In our streets, the whole of
Lebanon, with its Christians, Sunnis and Shias, are flying the flags of
Hezbollah. Again, the unipolar world has already been left back in
history. There is us, there is Iran, there is Syria, there is Vene
zuela, Cuba and North Korea. There are the resisting peoples of
Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan! As long as there is imperialism and
occupations, these people will continue resisting. They can forget about
peace. If they want peace, they should now respect the freedom of
peoples and should eliminate the collaborating gangs. God willing, the
victory will be ours. They are not going to be able to turn our country
and region into a Kosovo. Now our people are aware of everything and
will not play into imperialist tricks. We will absolutely not permit
them to attack Iran or Syria. We are going to fight for our freedom to
the last drop of our blood. Let no one doubt this. They are claiming
that Iran has nuclear wea pons at its disposal. On the contrary, most of
the nuclear weapons are in the hands of the collaborating gang of Israel
and the U.S. Furthermore, nuclear wea pons are nothing but excuses put
forward in order to create collaborating regimes in the region.
>
> There are claims that Hezbollah is being directed by Tehran.
>
> This is a great lie. We are an independent Lebanese organization. We
do not take orders from anyone. But this does not mean that we are not
going to form alli ances. Let me reiterate, we are on a side. We are on
the side of Iran and Syria. They are our brothers. We are going to
oppose any attack directed at Tehran and Dama scus to the last drop of
our blood just as we do in Lebanon. We uphold global resistance against
global imperial terrorism. Peace cannot be unilateral. So long as there
is imperialism in the world, a permanent peace is impossible. This war
will not come to an end as long as there are occupations in Iraq,
Afghanistan and Palestine.

The most concrete example of this has been Hugo ChÃ¡vez, the president of Venezuela. What most of the Muslim states could not do has been done by ChÃ¡vez by the withdrawal of their ambassador to Israel. He furthermore com municated to us his support for our resistance. This has been an immense source of morale for us. We can observe a similar reaction within the Turkish Revolutionary Movement. We had socialist brothers from Turkey who went to Palestine in the 1960s to fight against Israel. And one of them still remains in my memory and my heartâ€”Deniz Gezmis [founder of the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army of Turkeyâ€”WW] ...!

>> It is possible to see the posters of Che, ChÃ¡vez, Ahmadinejad and Hezbollah side by side in the streets of Beirut. Are these the signs of a new polarization?

>> We salute the leaders and the peoples of Latin America. They have resisted heroically against the American bandits and have been a source of morale for us. They are guiding the way for the oppressed peoples. Go and wander around our streets...! You will witness how our people have embraced ChÃ¡vez and Ernesto Che Gue vara. Nearly in every house, you will come across posters of Che or ChÃ¡vez. What we are saying to our socialist friends who want to fight together with us for fraternity and freedom, do not come at all if you are going to say religion is an opiate. We do not agree with this analysis. Here is the biggest proof of this in our streets with the pictures of ChÃ¡vez, Che, Sadr and Hamaney waving along together. These leaders are saluting our people in unison. So long as we respect your beliefs, and you respect ours, there is no imperialist power we cannot defeat!
>>
>> Western governments are intensifying their pressure on Damascus and Tehran for which they are proposing a change of regime. Some sources are of the view that the attack on Lebanon will be directed on Syria. Is a regional war possible?
>>
>> The centers of imperialist power want to make collaborators of our region as a whole. They expect us to kneel before them. Syria, Iran and we are opposing this. The provocation concerning the former Leba nese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and the efforts to secure the withdrawal of the Syrian army from Lebanon and going even further, their wish to attack callously on to Tehran and Damascus are all due to this reason. Syria, with Iran and Hezbollah will certainly resist this. The imperialists of the west are seeking to make a second Kosovo out of Lebanon and our region. They are seeking to create a clash between sects. But we have spoiled this trick. In our streets, the whole of Lebanon, with its Christians, Sunnis and Shias, are flying the flags of Hezbollah. Again, the unipolar world has already been left back in history. There is us, there is Iran, there is Syria, there is Vene zuela, Cuba and North Korea. There are the resisting peoples of Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan!

As long as there is imperialism and occupations, these people will
continue resisting. They can forget about peace. If they want peace,
they should now respect the freedom of peoples and should eliminate the
collaborating gangs. God willing, the victory will be ours. They are not
going to be able to turn our country and region into a Kosovo. Now our
people are aware of everything and will not play into imperialist
tricks. We will absolutely not permit them to attack Iran or Syria. We
are going to fight for our freedom to the last drop of our blood. Let no
one doubt this. They are claiming that Iran has nuclear wea pons at its
disposal. On the contrary, most of the nuclear weapons are in the hands
of the collaborating gang of Israel and the U.S. Furthermore, nuclear
wea pons are nothing but excuses put forward in order to create
collaborating regimes in the region.
>>
>> There are claims that Hezbollah is being directed by Tehran.
>>
>> This is a great lie. We are an independent Lebanese organization. We do not take orders from anyone. But this does not mean that we are not going to form alli ances. Let me reiterate, we are on a side. We are on the side of Iran and Syria. They are our brothers. We are going to oppose any attack directed at Tehran and Dama scus to the last drop of our blood just as we do in Lebanon. We uphold global resistance against global imperial terrorism. Peace cannot be unilateral. So long as there is imperialism in the world, a permanent peace is impossible. This war will not come to an end as long as there are occupations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine.

Hello Nick and others:

I appreciate your nuanced response to this issue of
what it means to describe the behavior of poetic
communities and the various ways that people try to
deal with their participation in those communities.

I think something important to keep in mind is the
ways in which it remains tempting to postulate
ourselves as outsiders to a situation that in fact we
are an intimate part of. I remember Tom Mandel saying
to me at one point that "There's always someone more
outside than you, and always someone more inside," and
I've found that an excellent point to keep in mind;
we're all somewhere in the process, both outside it
and caught up with it.

So when I too feel ambivalent about the behavior of
poetry communities, I feel like it's important to
remember that I myself am part of this ambivalent
process. I'm not simply watching it and commenting
from outside.

It's intriguing to me that attempts to position
oneself as an insider and attempts to position oneself
as an outsider are both parts of the sociological
games that we're all playing--and intriguing too to
consider that poets in poetry communities are doing
much more than simply playing any kind of sociological
game. So not only is there no simple division between
insiders and outsiders, there's no simple division
even in the case of a given individual, who can be
both inside in this way and outside in that one, or
who can shift feelings and stances as the occasion
permits. Sometimes nobody's even thinking about
insiders and outsiders at all. So when someone
comments about a particular group that "look at the
games they're playing," that sort of description is
almost always reductive, and usually in a harmful way.

One of the great troubles of sociology as a field has
been its attempt to describe social behavior from some
kind of outside stance, whether that be the
"objectivity" of the scientist or some variation of
same. Remember the old joke about the anthropologist
who, in studying the behavior of a local tribe, found
that in half an hour he was going to be married?

So my basic point regarding Gabe's use of Berne's
terminologies is that there is no purely outside
position from which one can either offer moral or
satirical critique of the kind implied by Berne. Any
game-playing theory has to acknowledge that it too has
a position in the game.

One last thing occurs to me, though, which is that
positioning oneself as an outsider--whether outraged,
bemused, or gently accepting of the foibles of
others--takes on a particular power in democratic
societies which believe, sometimes to a great extent,
in mythologies of inclusiveness. The stance has
potential for powerful benefits in asserting the
rights of marginalized citizens, but it also has
potential for abuse, since the stance really becomes
available for anyone who wishes to use it. Almost all
successful U.S. Presidential campaigns for
non-incumbents rely on the idea that one is an
outsider coming in to clean up foolishness or
corruption.

All best--

Mark

 >>Hollywood Supports Israeli Mass Murder

I'm relatively new to this List and wonder whether this kind
of blatant propaganda is a form of trolling, or whether it
is fair game to refute it. If the latter is the case, then a
long political thread would evolve on a list devoted to
poetry. It would be necessary to show how the author of the
cited article errs in particular facts and judgments, to
cite countering opinions, etc., and sooner or later everyone
would be annoyed or bored.

My instinct is to delete the post and move on, but that
would leave such errant nonsense unchallenged. On the other
hand if I engage the article as an expression of an opinion
with which the poster agrees, and to which he or she is
soliciting agreement, then a lot of political hot air
follows. {{Insert frowning face here.}}

What to do? I still favor delete-and-move-on. Opinions?


Best,
Eric

Dear Listfolk:

For any of you interested, I have a new blog, Possum Ego, here:

possumego.blogspot.com

Possum Ego will be updated each Monday and focus on whatever passes
across the radar. I'm using it as a way to work out informally
questions and concerns I have re: poetics, rhetoric, "secret publics"
and communication. Comments are welcome. This week's post responds,
in part, to Gabriel Gudding's comments re: "cultural scripts."

Best wishes,
Dale

oh please can we have more on this topic?! Please?! I feel a real void in my life where the heated inane discussions about the middle east that have
happened on this list used to be!

Sorry, Eric, i couldn't resist. I personally have adopted a "don't ask don't tell" approach to Ishaq. I don't believe he/she is completely rational,
and therefore a.) don't believe that rational responses to him/her are going to get anywhere and b.) in any case, if my suspicions about his/her
mental stability were correct, then what he/she really needs is considerate understanding by caring professionals and not having his/her paranoid
delusions confirmed by random attacks on his/her beliefs from strangers on the internet.

at least, that's where i stand on posts like that.

Well, yeah, but occasionally ...

I have to say I found the heads-up on Pouget's +Sabotage+ was useful.  And
not that difficult to backtrack, which I did as I'd missed the URL at the
end of Ishaq's post.

But then a Frenchman writing on 1890s Glasgow left politics in 1910, and
translated by an American, is rather a tasty brew, if only *very
tangentially connected with current political events.

Mind you, there might be mileage in this.  Anyone any thoughts on the mostly
UK but partly US responses to anarchist outbreaks in the 1890s,
aliens-among-us, terrorist bombs and all?

Lots of novels written about it -- Conrad's +The Secret Agent+, Robert Louis
Stevenson's +The Dynamiter+, G.K.Chesterton's +The Man Who Was Thursday+ are
the ones at the top of my head.

A Really Big Thing, and the End of Civilisation As We Know It.  Then
suddenly, about I'd guess 1920 at the latest, partly in the wake of WWI,
suddenly nobody's talking about it any more, and it's like Berne's +Games
People Play+, or Edgar Wallace's Saunders of the River stories, you find it
gathering dust in the back of the local Sally Ann shop and wonder why our
parents were so fussed about it.

I think part of the reason that after world war i no one gave a damn about the anarchists or trade unionists any more was because in the middle of
world war one the bolshevik revolution happened. After Makhno was crushed by the bolsheviks, the red flag eclipsed the black flag in most of the
world, and those inclined towards violence as a mode of political change realized the potency of socialism as an organizing principle rather than the
rather rag-tag anarchism of the nineteenth century. i think it's equally revealing that the anarcho syndicalists of the early twentieth century
adopted red and black flags although their allegiance to communist principles was fairly spotty, and really their system was more of a sophisticated
anarchism. having marched under both banners at various points in my life, I really don't think there's much difference between the foot soldiers of
teh red and the foot soldiers of the black. Neither view offers a cohesive response to market capitalism, and therefore neither view can be successful
in the open international markets of the first world post WWII. But Anarchism died a natural death in the early part of the twentieth century, and
people stopped looking at it as "the end of civilization" when it became clear that the powers that be in europe were much more capable of bringing
about that condition after the great war had raged a few years.

I, personally, just think it's kind of sad to see people still clinging to the leftism of the nineteenth century when the right has moved on so
capably despite the defeat of fascism in the nineteen forties. And particularly given the lovely economic theories that keynes and sraffa have gifted
us with to use in combat against the monetarist policies the right is currently using to break the backs of the poor, it's sort of criminal that
people are still talking about bakunin and his ilk in this age. anarchy is as relevant to sweat shop workers in bangladesh as are frock coats,
dynamite, and gatling guns. it's a dead world.

gentle with them.


"Television personality and environmentalist Steve Irwin has died from a
stingray wound while filming off north Queensland.

Friends believe he may have died instantly when struck by a stingray as
he  filmed a sequence for his eight-year-old daughter Bindi's new TV series.

Irwin's friend of 20 years, Ferre De Deyne said Irwin had been struck by
the stingray while filming. "The stingray just happened to be swimming
around and out of the blue whacked his tail at him," he said.

"It is absolutely tragic. I have dived so many times with stingrays and
they are usually very placid things," he said.

Known worldwide as the Crocodile Hunter,  44-year-old Irwin was famous
for his enthusiasm for wildlife and his catchcry "Crikey!"

Here is a page of links to Argentine net art:
http://www.martagonzalezobras.com.ar/pagweb.htm . The page is put together
by Marta Gonzales. It contains links to work from 1995 to the present. A lot
of compelling work here I have not seen before.

Also, here is a site of visual and other experimental poetry by the late
Argentine poet Edgardo Antonio Vigo (1927 - 1997): http://www.eavigo.com.ar
. There is an essay by the Uruguayan poet Clemente Padin about Vigo at
http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/vigo/vigocp.htm

The eavigo.com.ar site was put together by the people at
http://www.vorticeargentina.com.ar . This is an organization in Argentina
that deals with visual poetry of all types.

I assume that this "reminder" relates to people
flaming Ishaq & questioning his sanity.  But why was
there no reminder when their pronouncements on this
list like???:

I AM SICK AND TIRED OF HAVING TO RESPOND TO
PROPOGANDISTS LIKE ADEEENA
KARASICK. IT IS A TYPICAL TACTIC OF ANY OPPRESSOR TO
USE SOMEONE FROM
THE OPPRESSED COMMUNITY TO LEGITIMIZE THEIR PROJECT

This was of course from Paul Catafago, who as a matter
of fact I wish were still here, thought not posting
invective like the above.  The Darwish prison poems
Paul posted were indeed "gifts" as he kept asking for
people to acknowledge...and I'll say that from
whatever distance from Darwish's politics.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Palm Press is pleased to announce publication of:

THE NINES
by Christian Peet

Begun in response to Words of Mass Deception used to justify the US =
occupation of Iraq, THE NINES are prose poems/essays derived from =
appropriated critical, scientific, and instructional texts (dealing with =
linguistics, Monet, breakdancing, and swine, among other topics). An act =
of resistance against narrative's still-popular stranglehold on =
meaning-making, an indictment of the privileging of the intellect over =
the senses, THE NINES parody the systems that would have us measure =
"knowledge and skills such as comprehension, vocabulary . . . geometry, =
physics, social deconstruction, and the Mayan calendar-only to discover =
the answer is B) Rod McKuen and Mary Oliver."=20

Christian Peet's poetry, prose, and cross-genre work appears or is =
forthcoming in Bird Dog, canwehaveourballback?, Cranky, Drunken Boat, =
elimae, Fence, Octopus, Parakeet, Practice: New Writing + Art, Pom2, =
Shampoo, SleepingFish, Spinning Jenny, Word For/Word, Unpleasant Event =
Schedule, and other independent journals in print and online. His =
manuscript, A Mouthful of Burnt Pig, was a semi-finalist for the 2007 =
Sawtooth Poetry Prize from Ahsahta Press. He is Founder and =
Editor-in-Chief of Tarpaulin Sky Press & Online Journal, which has =
recently moved its offices from Brooklyn, NY, to Saxtons River, VT.


*

This long-awaited debut collection by tireless editor and fantastic =
poet, Christian Peet, has been flying off the shelves at Palm Press. THE =
NINES features original cover art by Derek White (editor & publisher of =
Calamari Press) and continues Palm Press' serial devotion to troubling =
the surfaces of poetry, prose, criticism and cultural work as poetic =
provocation. These poems smartly (often hilariously) probe the sometimes =
shallow depths of America's MFA industry (and the occasionally naughty =
offspring it tends to re/produce), pork and all things piggy, psilocybin =
gone break-neck breakdance jam, the world as we know it by Stephen =
Hawking and the history of modern art through a series of numerically =
fabulist poems hell-bent on exploiting that swingy little digit: love =
potion number 9. Check it out.

THE NINES, by Christian Peet

"Sabotage," which up to that time had been applied unconsciously and
instinctively by the workers, with the popular name which has remained
attached to it begins in 1895 to receive its baptism, its theoretical
consecration and to take its place amongst the other means of social
warfare, recognised, approved, advocated and practiced by the labour
unions. -- e. pouget -- "Sabotage"

Hello Mark,

I appreciate the point you make about the impossibility of
observing/acting from an "outside" vantage when describing cultural
scripts. I expect that at an abstract level you are right that it is at
some level impossible for any cultural actor not to make a
non-complicitous metadiscursive utterance about common powerplays and
cultural scripts attendant to any community.

But once consideration is pulled from that more abstract cultural plane
and into a less abstracted reality, into, that is, the specifics of
certain authorial methods, gender plays, temperaments, and alliances of
felt, grounded, local relations among real people, where manifestations
of kindness, honesty, play, gentle speech, and peaceful intellectual
communion, not to say friendship, might either flourish or, if diluted
by transactional negativities, falter -- then this is no longer a
problem of discerning a delicately defined "outside." It becomes instead
an issue of real ethics -- of, say, watching one's speech, of hearing
the concerns of others, of producing with positivity, of behaving in a
gentle, nurturing manner, of being, in other words, a responsive actor
who is not playing a reactive script like, say, "maverick." All of these
socio-emotional effects are observable by any sensible person as bodily
felt realities.

For instance, it was interesting to me (and maybe not surprising) that
of those people who backchanneled immediately with encouragement and
thanks for broaching the topic on both Buffpo and Lucipo, three-fourths
were women. And one explained that she had tried to broach these issues
herself but felt shouted down and condescended to by the boy's club on
Lucipo, mainly led by one older guy fond of playing "maverick," who
posted nearly a hundred times in the month of August.

So though I grant that my sketches were probably in some way hamfisted,
and though I'm down with the idea there is at a gross and abstract level
no "outside" to these observations, I am hesitant to join you in
inveighing against, well, the field of sociology in general for the
theoretical reasons you sketch, and I can't find a way to deny that
there are real grounded effects here that break down in this case along
lines of gender and power, and just plain bad manners. That said, I
appreciate the spirit of your reply and in particular I appreciate the
difficulties with such sketches that you so clearly and persuasively
describe.

Best to you,
Gabe

I appreciate Ishaq's posts, though they're so frequent and bulky that I don't read more than 10% of them. I've learned some stuff there.

But Eric Yost's question is important.

Eric, I think your post at least raises the problem, and that's, in some situations, the best one can hope for (though it also has the questionable character of criticizing another poster in the third person and asking everybody else for advice on how to deal with that poster; this, I think, can be a pretty nasty power game, whether you mean to do it here or not. But I appreciate your raising the question nonetheless).

In my own experience, the best thing to do is to test out the situation: respond, argue, contradict, and see if the person you think is wrong is willing to have an argument. If not (if they twist what you say, or start insulting you, or if it turns out they were just trying to provoke someone, and you fell into the trap, when they don't actually care as much about the issue as you do, etc.), stop having the conversation after a few posts. Don't be too proud to be the one to back out, if it's a waste of your time and an insult to the significance of the topic. Then the best response is no response.

RECENT REVIEWS AT TARPAULIN SKY
http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Reviews/index.html


James Wagner's _Trilce_, reviewed by Nick Bredie

"Instead of trying to bottle this chaos by translating for 'meaning,' Wagner
proceeds to 'translate' Vallejo homophonically. He picks an English word
close in sound to Vallejo's bastard Spanish and proceeds from there
[skillfully avoiding the possibility of real gibberish]. The results are
often magnificent . . ."
[READ MORE: http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Reviews/Trilce.html ]


Calamari Press & Text/Image, reviewed by Selah Saterstrom

"I am reminded that words might be erased/scraped hollow of utilitarian
impacted meat in order to mean. We scrape, break, and erase. The marks of
our gestures are visible, not separate events from writing, but a form of
writing. So that we might speak the languages of the dead and/or the "over
there" languages of the heart. Or rather: try for them to speak us."
[READ MORE: http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Reviews/Calamari_Press.html ]


Joshua Marie Wilkinson's _Suspension of a Secret in Abandoned Rooms_,
reviewed by Alexis M. Smith

"Genealogy is more than a catalog of influences and obsessions; as Wilkinson
demonstrates throughout these poems, it is about existing in the shared,
haunted spaces in which creative desire is born-what genes are to the family
tree. These are the "rooms" Wilkinson visits and invokes-dark places full of
strange private histories and shameful communal ones-places in which "every
day the war can't fathom itself."
[READ MORE: http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Reviews/Suspension.html ]


Juliana Spahr's _this connection of everyone with lungs_, reviewed by Alexis
M. Smith

"Reading this connection of everyone with lungs, now, in a period
politicians and pundits constantly refer to as "post-war," is both
heartbreaking and, somehow, comforting. Heartbreaking because we are still,
years later, powerless and bereft, grappling with losses half a world away,
trying to make sense of them in a country intent on keeping its distance.
And comforting because Spahr has written a book that will doubtless be read
for as long as humans exist, to understand what the hell happened in the
early part of the twenty-first century."
[READ MORE: http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Reviews/this_connection.html ]


Ethan Paquin's _The Violence_, reviewed by Alexis M. Smith

"[In The Violence,] the natural world and its processes are a mirror for the
vast internal spaces ravaged and rebuilt by human relationships. "Rain/plies
onward in restless sleep, re-gathering over the lakes and all,/and so do we.
And so it goes with all these gone places, now silences/made salient by hard
roads not so interested in us at all." The "gone places" and "silences" mark
the changes, the internal and external losses, and the grief for those
losses. What makes this poem, and all of The Violence, engaging is Paquin's
ability to evoke those gone places."

London bomb sensation (hoffman sub dub the samo samo)

"Sabotage," which up to that time had been applied unconsciously and
instinctively by the workers, with the popular name which has remained
attached to it begins in 1895 to receive its baptism, its theoretical
consecration and to take its place amongst the other means of social

I agree with much of what is said here, although I doubt that sports or other activities can bring one to a similar state of equanimous awareness due to attachment and possibly aversion that accompany any form of competitive activity.  Creativity such as in the arts could come close in that it appears spontaneously.  But the effect of equanimity that comes sometimes from hearing a great piece of music or seeing great art is usually short-lived, at least in my experience.  As for the Buddhist/Buddhism versus Dhamma argument, I agree with what you say essentially, that the dhamma isn't a religion, nevertheless when I'm asked what my religion is, I inevitably say that I'm a Buddhist.  I have little use for the rites and rituals that attached themselves to and eventually, for the most part, supplanted the practice of meditation long after the Buddha's parinibbana.  Is this list the right place to discuss these things?  Why not?  It certainly seems more interesting, at least to
 me, than a lot of the political discussions that don't seem to be about literature, directly, either.

Gabriel Gudding <gmguddi@ILSTU.EDU> wrote:  hi stephen,

tho i appreciate your pressing the point about "buddhism" and vipassana,
and whether i am or amn't this or that, i think this is off the thread
topic and possibly not the space to talk about this stuff. but as it's
an important subject, here goes: the buddha sd over and over again that
he only taught "dhamma," which is a word that could be translated as
"reality." so for those who, like me, shy away from religion and
religious concerns, understand that the word "dhamma," acc to the
suttas, neither connotes nor denotes anything religious. nor was the
buddha's teaching a religion. "buddhism" per se was invented later.
the buddha taught a method of emancipation from unhappiness -- and he
made a point of being keenly secular.

he taught dhamma, not buddhism. others later made it into something full
of rites and rituals, romanticizing the practice of meditation into
various "sudden awakening" systems etc.

quite simply, "dhamma" is a secular term which references a moral system
and an experiential training in what could loosely be called an "art of
living," in the ancient tradition of the Ars Vivendi. it's just a
"funny" word to describe something quite powerful in its efficacy. if
practiced.

that was my only point about that.

as regards whether vipassana is like basketball, quilting, etc:
vipassana is a unique and specific practice for purifying the mind and
heart. its effects are unique -- and its practice is distinct from all
other human activities that i'm aware of. certainly people can get
benefit from the activities you mention, but the benefits from vipassana
are exceptional, but that is not to say that people don't discover it on
their own: people do discover the method of vipassana on their own. i
think certain athletes especially (lance armstrong, say) are inclined
"discover" a rigorous method of self-awareness and equanimity akin to
vipassana -- and i think that people who deal with great physical pain
and discomfort are more likely to discover it on their own. the buddha
himself said he "re-discovered" it as a practice.

i've only been practicing it seriously for three years, tho i was first
introduced to it in 1991: i could not keep the base of morality and
moral conduct necessary to practice it until 2002.

warmly,
gabe

<<

Gabriel, I think you are being a little disingenuous here! Particularly in
part on account of both your large reading and vispassana practice of - I
believe you said - of now about 20 years.
I have not done the reading, but I have done the practice - including the
retreats for the past several years. Yet, I - and the practitioners that
practice with - would never say, "I am a Buddhist." In my experience, the
focus is always on the "practice" (the presence of the process) and the
teacher. Vipassana is one form of Buddist practice. (For some, the attention
of playing basketball might be another, or mountain climbing, or quilting
or, why not, the the attention and process of making a poem - yet, these,
too, are only fractions/manifestations of a much larger space/spaciousness.
Each of which - depending on the concentration of the practitioner - may or
may be informed and guided by the teaching of the teachings of the Buddha -
as you well define in what follows:

>but i do read and heed what the buddha actually said
> and did. if you go on any long vipassana retreats, or read any of the

I suspect what is obnoxious or false about the statement, "I am a Buddhist"
is that it suggests there is a container (Buddha) that one can enter, find
a home, and worship this figure as a God, instead of a person who was
primarily a teacher (and a very pragmatic one- as you point out - at that.)

So what does one say? "I am engaged in one of many Buddhist practices (x
kind meditation) the teachings as handed down from a man called Buddha."

Suspect a life of example is more illuminating and persuasive than most
definitions.

Yes, the lives of practitioners (no matter the form of practice) also
abounds with histories of contrary vices.

As any given word may have several or sometimes even many meanings, I think you're limiting yourself to three could be a problem if you wish to take meaning(s) into account.

Jesse Crockett <jesse@LISTENLIGHT.NET> wrote:  what would you call the primary dimensions of a word? i've read that an
individual word may have over a hundred dimensions, but let's say we are
limited to just three, for any type of word..

i'm preparing to write a computer program to automate the assignment of
these dimensions based on their dictionary definitions, and then by
discrete input and automated web searches for assignment based on the
proximity to other words in a very broad sample of writing. it's a very
basic approach, tho i must start with something..

what do you think of this approach? what three dimensions do you note of
a given word, either by itself or w/in a phrase or sentence? this
note-taking is normally done w/ unconscious mental filters, as it's
irrelevant to the higher functioning of our understanding and perception.

ok –– it has nice ideas in it – but fuck it’s really boring –

  some great lines could have used a lot  (lots and lots) of editing

  frankly this is the kinda of political  poem i really hate – lots of proper nouns that need to or just get explained (it's not a new paper article)

  sorry nothing new here

  like an anti-war hallmark card


  yes war is not good but poems like this are not the answer

Hey Jane--

Did I tell you that after writing that whole 11 page edits sheet and staying
up half that night, I slept till 9 a.m. (!) and looked at your alignment of
the front matter the next morning and really "saw" the design more clearly
and liked it.

Just wanted to let you know--we can talk more about it all later, but wanted
to share the revelation.

your very benign remarks is interesting, and slightly
unfortunate, I think. There's been no flaming here, so
far.
All praise the Delete function.

Andy wrote that my post had: the questionable character of
criticizing another poster in the third person and asking
everybody else for advice on how to deal with that poster;
this, I think, can be a pretty nasty power game, whether you
mean to do it here or not.


Eric: People could just as easily have told me to shut up as
have warned me against starting a political Fool's Errand
thread. Ishaq's post was incidental, and I referred to him
in the third person precisely because his post was
incidental to the larger issue. I'm new to the List, and was
questioning the boundaries of political commentary on it.

To make it plainer, if there were a Nazi on the List and she
were posting Nazi propaganda without additional comment, I
would have posed the same question in more or less the same way.

Anyway, enough self-justification. Back to poetry.

Shearsman Books has published Portraits, an ebook by Carlos
Blackburn, at
http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/ebooks/ebooks_home.html. It's
the record of encounters with three autistic adults. Formally
beautiful and eloquently clear-eyed, and informed with a profound
compassion and admiration for his subjects.

While you're checking it out, there are lots of other goodies at the
Shearsman site, including a wonderful ebook by Geoff Squires and a
catalogue of treasures. The recently-published translations of
Vallejo's Trilce and Complete Later Poems, by Michael Smith &
Valentino Gianuzzi, and Maurice Scully's Tig, are I think essential.

Greetings all,

This fall I will be editing a feature on Chicago-based poet William
Fuller, author most recently of Watchword (Flood 2006), for a
forthcoming issue of Jacket magazine, and I would welcome contact
from any of you who share an interest in Bill's amazing and demanding
work.

I'm seeking poems, prose pieces, critical takes brief or sustained,
interviews, and other modes of response to any and all aspects of
Fuller's practice as a poet. I am happy to consider previously
published works, but it is my hope to have the majority of the
feature consist of new writing done just for this occasion.

Please feel free to pass the word along to others who might be
interested.

Many thanks, and all best,

Steve

Woodstove,
by Bronwen Tate

Where we start, the fourth wall raw without shingles. All
posed sitting on toilets in the front yard. The origin isn't
quiet. Rebuilt hours, just so someone could ask
can I borrow the keys? She shied away from that nearness,
while I watched from the background. Blue tricycle ran a rut,
ran around in between, ran home mad. Dropping
by on the way, like occasions for the kettle. Charmed,
I watched the top half swing open. Chicken coop,
rhododendron shelter, tool shed, wood pile, and
winter, a wind against which we can keep the door shut.

*Boog City is a New York City-based small press now in its 16th year and
East Village community newspaper of the same name. It has also published 35
volumes of poetry and various magazines, featuring work by Allen Ginsberg
and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, and theme issues on baseball,
women=B9s writing, and Louisville, KY. It  hosts and curates two regular
performance series--d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press, where
each month a non-NYC small press and its writers and a musical act of their
choosing is hosted at Chelsea's ACA Galleries; and Classic Albums Live,
where 5-13 local musical acts perform a classic album live at venues
including The Bowery Poetry Club, CBGB's, and The Knitting Factory. Past
albums have included Elvis Costello, My Aim is True; Nirvana, Nevermind; an=
d
Liz Phair, Exile in Guyville.


*Dan Fishback

Raised on a steady diet of showtunes and secular Jewish leftism, Dan
Fishback was destined to be gay and loud. In 2003, he moved to New York
City, where he promptly became a fixture in the legendary Anti-Folk
community. As half of the indie-pop duo Cheese On Bread, Dan saturated the
Lower East Side with his characteristic blend of coy spunk and fierce
progressive ideology. It was his solo work, however, that established him a=
s
more than a bouncy pop singer.

Hailed by Next Magazine as an "anti-folk genius," Dan's songs of frustratio=
n
and fear provided a welcome change to the vacuous vamping found in so much
"queer art." Ironic without being nihilistic, passionate without being
annoying, Dan writes outside of and against consumerist mainstream gay
culture.=20

His debut album, Sweet Chastity, is a frantic, schizophrenic exploration of
virginity in a culture that commodifies the human body. From the twisted
electro-pulse of the title track to the Carpenters-esque croon of "Kiss and
Tell," Sweet Chastity blends at least a dozen musical genres into an
anti-pop mission statement of bitter wit and seething optimism.

His latest play, Please Let Me Love You, a meditation on Michael Jackson,
the war in Iraq, and the nature of evil, has been performed in New York and
Philadelphia, and showcases the style of tragi-comic surrealism that
Fishback developed in early solo performances like Assholes Speak Louder
Than Words and Boi With an i.

Legendary performance art venue P.S. 122 recently mounted a festival of his
diverse projects in No Direction Homo: The Many Identical Personae of Dan
Fishback.=20

Fishback is currently writing a young-adult romance novel about teenagers
discovering postmodernism on the internet, a play about Hellenized Judea an=
d
the Maccabbean uprising, and a comic book about an overweight, bi-racial,
14-year-old homosexual named Clarence. Dan will be the subject of a
documentary piece on PBS' gay newsmagazine, In The Life, in fall 2006.


*Roger Hitts

Roger Hitts is a veteran celebrity, political, and music scribe whose
titillating tales frequently appear on the pages of Star, National Enquirer=
,
and In Touch magazines. A two-time winner of the United Press International
columnist of the year, covering politics and interviewing the likes of
former presidents Reagan and Bush 1.0, he has also been an active reporter
on the rock music scene for more than 25 years, having interviewed scores o=
f
musical legends from The Flaming Lips to Johnny Cash. A native of Flint,
Michigan and a protege of Michael Moore, Hitts has been a frequent
contributor to Boog City.


*HuggaBroomstik

HuggaBroomstik is a musical project that began January 7, 2001. In the past
five years, HuggaBroomstik has evolved from a joke (between founding
members, Neil Kelly and Dashan Coram) to an international underground
phenomenon.=20
 =20
How did this happen? In the beginning, no one wanted anything to do with
Hugga. Neil and Dashan drafted a couple of other friends, with little or no
musical talent to help fill out their sound. HuggaBroomstik had to produce
their own sophmoric recordings, and resorted to trickery in order to book
shows. Progress was slow and difficult at first, but as HuggaBroomstik
continued to play shows around the New York City area, they found that thei=
r
unique sound and vision was not lost on everybody. Little by little, people
began to admit that they actually liked HuggaBroomstik.
 =20
By the end of 2001, HuggaBroomstik stumbled upon The Sidewalk Cafe and the
New York City AntiFolk scene. Once they had weasled their way into this
thriving artistic community, they began to draw inspiration (and street
cred) from such notable acts as the Moldy Peaches, Dufus, Schwervon!, and
Jeffery Lewis. Within a short period, HuggaBroomstik had secured a place fo=
r
themselves in the NY Antifolk scene.
 =20
In 2002, HuggaBroomstik recorded and released what they considered to be
their first real album. Their self-titled debut was released that summer,
and was met with equal amounts of praise and mockery. HuggaBroomstik did no=
t
mind the harsh reviews, noting that they just made the joke funnier.
 =20
HuggaBroomstik, however, did make an effort to improve their craft. In 2002
and 2003, HuggaBroomstik adopted Dibson T. Hoffweiler to play lead guitar
and Chris Maher to play bass. After drummer, Arthur Joseph, quit the band,
HuggaBroomstik picked up Monica Samalot (Just About To Burn), who was later
replaced by Johnny Dydo (The WoWz). The five men make up the core of
HuggaBroomstik, although many other have lent their talents to the project.
 =20
Since their debut album, HuggaBroomstik has released two full-length albums=
,
Enter Tha Broomstik (2003) and Sloppy Kisses and Serious Guitars (2005).
Their latest release is an EP titled The Soundz of Thyme (2005).
 =20
Recently, HuggaBroomstik was part of The April Fools Tour, traveling around
Europe playing shows with The WoWz (NYC) and Horror Me (Berlin). The tour
was a huge success and a true milestone for HuggaBroomstik. The band plans
to continue "living the joke," indefinitely.
 =20

*Prewar Yardsale

We are Prewar Yardsale. We are dina and mike. We play a bucket and a tincan
and a guitar with a fuzzbox and a flute and a tamborine. And we sing songs
that we write in bed at night after our son goes to sleep. We are part of a
really cool collective of artists on a website called olivejuice music. We
play shows in New York and once in awhile in Paris and London. We have two
full albums out on Olive Juice Music, called Lowdown and We are Singing a
Sad Song. and we also have a live cdr called Washington Soundboard
Recording. We also have a 7" single that was put out in England on a-ok
records, with four songs on it. We are thinking about releasing a cd with
our Peel session that we did in 2003 on the John Peel show on BBC 1. We lov=
e
music, and we love to play shows when we can, and we love Olive Juice Music=
.


*Renminbi

Think, Move, Get Your Rocks Off -- we want you to be able to do all three a=
t
our shows. Definitely not for the faint-hearted, we combine stripped-down
punk basics with ass-shaking keyboard grooves and apocalyptic build-ups.
Someone else said it best: "Imagine Polvo fronted by Kim Gordon and you
might have a sense of NYC trio Renminbi's sound. =8A Pitting frenetic
drumbeats against postrock keyboards and angular guitar, Renminbi retain al=
l
the concision without losing an ounce of urgency."


*The Sparrows

Andrew Phillip Tipton met Rachel Talentino in Savannah while working at the
Gap.  A common love for catchy melodies, Carole King, and boys led them to
Brooklyn.  As The Sparrows, Andrew and Rachel make up the cutest anti-folk
duo around! Simple and lovely.


*Max Steele and the Party Ice

Max Steele is new to New York.


*Urban Barnyard

There are a lot of animals in the city. But not a lot of bands brave enough
to write songs about them. Urban Barnyard began as a way for Dibs, Dashan,
Phoebe, Daoud, and Casey to spend time together away from the disapproving
gazes of their peers. Now it has blossomed into a glorious
art-indie-bangy-rock experience for everyone to share.

Some people may say that writing songs only about animals in New York is
limiting. Some people may say that playing instruments you're not familiar
with is a bad idea. Or that reading The New York Post on stage or making up
a tune as you go during a show is unprofessional. But those people are
scared. And probably jerks. We all get scared sometimes. Even Urban Barnyar=
d
gets scared sometimes. The important thing is just to trust that it will al=
l
be okay. More than that, it will probably all be frickin' awesome.

Hello Gabe, my potential friend: where you have seen
me doubt that poetry communities are often troubling,
and that gender and behavior are part of what make
them troubling?

But nothing about my comments was "abstract"--anybody
who is worrying about how a particular poetry
community treats them is on some level part of that
community or at the very least wanting to be part of
it. People are misused by the poetry communities they
are part of--and misuse those communities--in
complicated ways. To suggest that it's simply poetry
communities who misuse people, and not also people who
misuse communities, is only part of that truth.

You discuss my argument in rather painful binaries:
"abstract" vs. "real," "cultural planes" vs "bodies,"
"women" vs. "mavericks." You seem to suggest that were
I to be more invested in what you call "real ethics,"
that I would see, well, what? That people in the world
of poetry are being hurt? That many of these people
are women because poetry communities are part of, and
continue, a variety of sexist cultures? You seem to
suggest that somehow, as a man, these are things I
haven't seen before. But where do you see me saying
that I have not seen them? I'm saying only that your
language for addressing these things isn't really so
great.

I still feel, therefore, that you might consider
changing the basic terms of your rhetoric. That
rhetoric makes use of the concept of "gentle speech"
as a way of grounding a rather transparent, aggressive
moral assault on communities whose activies I'm still
not sure you've tried to understand. And I have to
admit that I don't believe that a solution can be
found in treating all situations in a "gentle,
nurturing manner," and in fact you yourself said
something similar in a previous post. Displacing a
rhetoric of "male hardness" with a rhetoric of
"gentleness" (if you want to say "female gentleness,"
you can, but I'm not going to) is a kind of assertion
of the opposite principle that strikes me as rather
abstract.

I don't know you well, and I have to admit that
there's something about your approach that I don't
understand. On the one hand, you attack poetry
communities aggressively; on the other, you cloak
yourself in a belief in "gentleness" when I and others
respond to that attack. You insist on an absolutist
rhetoric of real vs. fake, and assign to yourself,
unproblematically it seems to me, the role of the Pure
Knight of the Real. Don't you think that's a horse
that very few of us--in the case of poetry communities
especially--should be ascending?

And finally, is it possible not to tout the women who
have backchannled you as evidence of the truth of your
position? That's one of the fascinating things about
complicated men discussing poetics at the moment,
isn't it? That we feel so exposed and uncertain that
we must insist that it's women who have vaidated the
arguments that we're making?

Thanks very much for engaging with me in this
discussion--

Mark

Subject: A Small Catalog of Cultural Scripts

Hello Mark,

I appreciate the point you make about the
impossibility of
observing/acting from an "outside" vantage when
describing cultural
scripts. I expect that at an abstract level you are
right that it is at
some level impossible for any cultural actor not to
make a
non-complicitous metadiscursive utterance about common
powerplays and
cultural scripts attendant to any community.

But once consideration is pulled from that more
abstract cultural plane
and into a less abstracted reality, into, that is, the
specifics of
certain authorial methods, gender plays, temperaments,
and alliances of
felt, grounded, local relations among real people,
where manifestations
of kindness, honesty, play, gentle speech, and
peaceful intellectual
communion, not to say friendship, might either
flourish or, if diluted
by transactional negativities, falter -- then this is
no longer a
problem of discerning a delicately defined "outside."
It becomes
instead
an issue of real ethics -- of, say, watching one's
speech, of hearing
the concerns of others, of producing with positivity,
of behaving in a
gentle, nurturing manner, of being, in other words, a
responsive actor
who is not playing a reactive script like, say,
"maverick." All of
these
socio-emotional effects are observable by any sensible
person as bodily
felt realities.

For instance, it was interesting to me (and maybe not
surprising) that
of those people who backchanneled immediately with
encouragement and
thanks for broaching the topic on both Buffpo and
Lucipo, three-fourths
were women. And one explained that she had tried to
broach these issues
herself but felt shouted down and condescended to by
the boy's club on
Lucipo, mainly led by one older guy fond of playing
"maverick," who
posted nearly a hundred times in the month of August.

So though I grant that my sketches were probably in
some way hamfisted,
and though I'm down with the idea there is at a gross
and abstract
level
no "outside" to these observations, I am hesitant to
join you in

Actually, it's a fairly good poem about a lousy topic giving the =
appearance of a lousy poem...somebody wrote earlier about the need to =
edit lines in the piece, and I'm in total agreement on that point. =20

The difficulty with such works as this one is the timing.  Remember the =
immortal words of Bob Hope: good comedy is all about timing. =20

That same point should be made about good poetry.  Unfortunately, for =
this one, shitty timing.=20

And of course, one needs to underscore the meaning of the word, "good."  =

Digital deeds of the well-versed

by Bernard Lane
The Australian Education Feature

06 September 2006

'TO me, having a memory is impressive, like being able to speak Russian," poet Laurie Duggan once said. It's unusually hard for Duggan, a Victorian who has fetched up in Brisbane, to make sense of his childhood: "Often things I think are memory are the memory of photographs viewed later rather than the actual events." He traces his memory loss back to the age of 16 when he had a stroke and collapsed in a locker room at school.

Australian poetry itself has a bad memory and one cause may be a degenerative process in the organs of publishing. Even fine contemporary work quickly goes out of print, if not out of mind.

Enter John Tranter, the Sydney poet, and the case of the author notes. Penguin's handsome anthology of modern Australian poetry, edited by Tranter and Philip Mead, came out in 1991, but without any biographical sketches of the authors. Tranter recalls: "Penguin said, 'If you want them in, you'll have to take out an equal number of pages of poetry."'

Such were the economics of publishing. Too hard to sacrifice poetry; the author notes had to be left out.

"Over the years, I felt bad about that," Tranter says. But he feels good about the internet: it looks like it can connect poets to a new, benign economics of publishing.

Not so long ago Tranter's first slim volume, Parallax (1970), was given a fresh lease of digital life, thanks to the web servers at the University of Sydney and a small grant from the Australian Research Council.

In hard copy, Parallax also had a home on the shelf at the university's Fisher Library.

"The little borrowing card in the back says it has been borrowed less than a dozen times in 30 years," Tranter says. Digital Parallax gets 1500 visits a month.

If the moral is not yet obvious, look at Jacket, Tranter's online poetry magazine. It's a phenomenon. New poetry, necrologies of once new poets, reviews and interviews, travelogues and translations: all this and more is measured up, marked up and tucked in without Jacket ever losing its elegant shape.

More than 500,000 visitors have tried Jacket on since 1997; there are thousands of pages cleverly concealed in its lining.

"The internet changes everything," Tranter says.

No page limits, no trade-offs between poetry and bio notes. No need for distribution, since readers and search engines do the job themselves. An obvious idea: post the Penguin bio notes to the web.

"Then I thought, why limit myself to just the authors in the book?" Tranter says.

Sydney University's English department told Tranter about the ARC Linkage grants but these called for some kind of industry involvement. As it happened, Tranter knew the Copyright Agency Ltd, an agent for authors, had been doing interesting work on the intersection between the web, copyright and payment.

So CAL will help develop the cutely named APRIL project - Australian Poetry Resources Internet Library - under the leadership of Elizabeth Webby, at the English department, with Tranter as adviser.

The ARC has approved funding of $582,419 over four years. There'll be money for a PhD research scholarship in contemporary poetry. Some money will go to India, where poetry volumes are to be digitised; some will be spread across Australia as research assistants interview poets and record their far-flung readings.

"Just about anybody who's had a book out in Australia we hope to have on the website," Tranter says.

To get an idea what APRIL may be like, you can visit a prototype -

     http://www.austlit.com/a/index.html -

that Tranter has been working on since 2004. You'll find the Penguin bio notes. Many poets' entries offer a bibliography and a selection of poems; there are photos (one poet with cat, another with wine glass), reviews, articles and links to more elsewhere. With a little money from the Australia Council Literature Board, Tranter approached 16 poets for material; $150 a poet was on offer.

Some poets sold a small selection of poems; others, such as Duggan, gave plenty. His diary excerpts, spanning the years from 1968 to 2005, fascinate and amuse. (They contain the immortal entry: "26thAugust. Tinker with dodgy new poem.")

It's clear that not all poets work from the same business plan.

"We expect some poets will make work available for free and some will value their work very highly," says CAL chief executive Michael Fraser. "The essential point for us would be that it be the poet who chooses."

CAL brings to project APRIL a system that will allow poets to put a digital price tag on their work. (Much of the work will be out of print but in copyright.) A browse on screen will remain free of charge, but readers will pay for works they'd like to keep and print.

Ultimately, the system will allow readers to range far beyond APRIL - wherever works carry a tag known as a digital object identifier - and to print on demand a kind of personal anthology. It could put more poets online without them being ripped off.

"Poetry has been especially vulnerable because all the work and effort is distilled into one page, or a small number of pages, which is easily exploited by copying," Fraser says. He hopes the APRIL project - and the conversation it may strike up between poetry and readers - will reinvent the kind of popular oral tradition still alive elsewhere.

"There's a lot of good poetry in Australia and around the world," Fraser says. "I think it's a natural way of speaking and our ways of speaking have become very straitened. Particularly in Australia, poetry is no longer carried in the breath of our people."

APRIL's audience may have something of a scholarly bias. Webby hopes the project will inspire more study of Australian poetry, not just at university but in schools and overseas, where Australian studies has a small but devoted following.

She'd also be happy if would-be poets applied themselves to the lessons to be found in the APRIL archive. "Part of the problem is that a lot of the people who write poetry don't read poetry," she says.

Webby has been judging for the 2006 Broadway Poetry Prize. Too often, the entries show a limited grasp of what the language can do.

The APRIL project could do many things. You might think it could re-create the golden age of poetry publication. In fact, that would be a rather modest ambition.

"Most poetry in this country has been self-published always, even people like Mary Gilmore were probably funding their own publication," Webby says.

The golden age of the 1970s and '80s, coinciding with a new sense of cultural nationalism, was as short-lived as it was atypical.

The APRIL project promises to be something bigger and more interesting than a mere corrective to conventional publishing.

"It points to the future of what poetry can be," Tranter says. "It's a very interesting age to be in."

this is tricky.  is it a translation?  does anyone here know about
traditional hebrew poetry/chant?  having lived in hawaii for years, i know
some native hawaiian poetry has been dismissed as bad or uninteresting
without understanding the tradition it comes from or the cultural
underpinnings of it.  i'm not, definitely not, a relativist.  but i
believe value can't be assigned outside of context.  or if it is, the
judgement is superficial.  all best, g

Hello Gabe, my potential friend: where you have seen
me doubt that poetry communities are often troubling,
and that gender and behavior are part of what make
them troubling?

But nothing about my comments was "abstract"--anybody
who is worrying about how a particular poetry
community treats them is on some level part of that
community or at the very least wanting to be part of
it. People are misused by the poetry communities they
are part of--and misuse those communities--in
complicated ways. To suggest that it's simply poetry
communities who misuse people, and not also people who
misuse communities, is only part of that truth.

You discuss my argument in rather painful binaries:
"abstract" vs. "real," "cultural planes" vs "bodies,"
"women" vs. "mavericks." You seem to suggest that were
I to be more invested in what you call "real ethics,"
that I would see, well, what? That people in the world
of poetry are being hurt? That many of these people
are women because poetry communities are part of, and
continue, a variety of sexist cultures? You seem to
suggest that somehow, as a man, these are things I
haven't seen before. But where do you see me saying
that I have not seen them? I'm saying only that your
language for addressing these things isn't really so
great.

I still feel, therefore, that you might consider
changing the basic terms of your rhetoric. That
rhetoric makes use of the concept of "gentle speech"
as a way of grounding a rather transparent, aggressive
moral assault on communities whose activies I'm still
not sure you've tried to understand. And I have to
admit that I don't believe that a solution can be
found in treating all situations in a "gentle,
nurturing manner," and in fact you yourself said
something similar in a previous post. Displacing a
rhetoric of "male hardness" with a rhetoric of
"gentleness" (if you want to say "female gentleness,"
you can, but I'm not going to) is a kind of assertion
of the opposite principle that strikes me as rather
abstract.

I don't know you well, and I have to admit that
there's something about your approach that I don't
understand. On the one hand, you attack poetry
communities aggressively; on the other, you cloak
yourself in a belief in "gentleness" when I and others
respond to that attack. You insist on an absolutist
rhetoric of real vs. fake, and assign to yourself,
unproblematically it seems to me, the role of the Pure
Knight of the Real. Don't you think that's a horse
that very few of us--in the case of poetry communities
especially--should be ascending?

And finally, is it possible not to tout the women who
have backchannled you as evidence of the truth of your
position? That's one of the fascinating things about
complicated men discussing poetics at the moment,
isn't it? That we feel so exposed and uncertain that
we must insist that it's women who have vaidated the
arguments that we're making?

Thanks very much for engaging with me in this
discussion--

Mark

Subject: A Small Catalog of Cultural Scripts

Hello Mark,

I appreciate the point you make about the
impossibility of
observing/acting from an "outside" vantage when
describing cultural
scripts. I expect that at an abstract level you are
right that it is at
some level impossible for any cultural actor not to
make a
non-complicitous metadiscursive utterance about common
powerplays and
cultural scripts attendant to any community.

But once consideration is pulled from that more
abstract cultural plane
and into a less abstracted reality, into, that is, the
specifics of
certain authorial methods, gender plays, temperaments,
and alliances of
felt, grounded, local relations among real people,
where manifestations
of kindness, honesty, play, gentle speech, and
peaceful intellectual
communion, not to say friendship, might either
flourish or, if diluted
by transactional negativities, falter -- then this is
no longer a
problem of discerning a delicately defined "outside."
It becomes
instead
an issue of real ethics -- of, say, watching one's
speech, of hearing
the concerns of others, of producing with positivity,
of behaving in a
gentle, nurturing manner, of being, in other words, a
responsive actor
who is not playing a reactive script like, say,
"maverick." All of
these
socio-emotional effects are observable by any sensible
person as bodily
felt realities.

For instance, it was interesting to me (and maybe not
surprising) that
of those people who backchanneled immediately with
encouragement and
thanks for broaching the topic on both Buffpo and
Lucipo, three-fourths
were women. And one explained that she had tried to
broach these issues
herself but felt shouted down and condescended to by
the boy's club on
Lucipo, mainly led by one older guy fond of playing
"maverick," who
posted nearly a hundred times in the month of August.

So though I grant that my sketches were probably in
some way hamfisted,
and though I'm down with the idea there is at a gross
and abstract
level
no "outside" to these observations, I am hesitant to
join you in
inveighing against, well, the field of sociology in
general for the
theoretical reasons you sketch, and I can't find a way
to deny that
there are real grounded effects here that break down
in this case along
lines of gender and power, and just plain bad manners.
That said, I
appreciate the spirit of your reply and in particular
I appreciate the
difficulties with such sketches that you so clearly
and persuasively
describe.

Best to you,
Gabe

hi all,

sort of wandering through philosophy books this am, thought this was
interesting, and enter it here --

"The first reaction to the fact that, in Poland, social reality was
"unrepresented", as Kieslowski put it, was, of course, the move toward a
more adequate representation of real life in all its drabness and ambiguity
-- in short, an authentic documentary approach:

'There was a necessity, a need--which was very exciting for us--to describe
the world.  The Communist world had described how it should be and not how
it really was...If something hasn't been described, then it doesn't
officially exist.  So that if we start describing it, we bring it to life.'"

--another of those "philosophical" approaches to the Kantian divide I'll
check out with my resident Kantian after he comes home from campus....


back to work and lurking,

best,

Hi again, Mark.

As you might find my previous short response too short, I provide this.

Your email asks me ten questions whose premises are presumably
based on the contents of my post, but I don't follow how you
arrived at those premises, not to mention the questions. So, you urge
that I've misread you in a few ways, and you in turn seem to be urging a
misreading of my post too. What to do?

I did, yes, come away seeing something abstract in yr post, and I
suppose, yes, that I did use binaries. Never been able to avoid those
pesky things. They're everywhere. Nor have I found a text or writer who
could avoid them, including, I notice, you. :)

And I didn't, no, suggest that it's simply poetry communities that
misuse people (I didn't mention misusing people at all, in fact).

Nor would I think it accurate to say that my two posts containing
sketches of, I think, 5 transactional games common to some male poets on
listserves is me "attacking poetry communities aggressively." Especially
given that I call the sketches a small catalog. I say sketch and
catalog, using textual metaphors, which you then reframe in military terms.

And I did not assert, not knowing you, that you would do well to be
"more invested in real ethics," nor did I assert (as you suggest that I
did) that you haven't seen sexism in poetry before. Nor in fact was I
(as you assert) trying to state my sketches were "truth" by saying
three-fourths who backchanneled encouragements were women. And neither
did I anywhere "insist" on (and I'm using quote marks here not to be
persnickety but just to remind others that these aren't my words) an
"absolute rhetoric of the real" or "assign" myself the "role of Pure
Knight of the Real."

I guess what I'm getting at is I seem to be doing a lot of sweeping here
just to get back to (what I consider) clear ground, and I'm beginning to
wonder if this exchange can remain a conversation.

But if you would like to have a conversation about what I said in my
post, I'd be happy to.

Perhaps it would help if I forwarded a link in another email, which I'll
do if I get time before heading to work.

My very best to you,

Gabe

hi gabe,

i think the simple point that mark wallace makes is that when, in your original post, you claim that  "Thumping the hand at the woeful state of X helps create the perception that (a) something is wrong, and (b) we're the folks, or I'm the guy (usually a guy), to set this right," there is a very real, concrete way in which you, through your post, are assuming the position of "that guy." the objective or distanced, even sociological tone of your post seems to belie this.

bests,

First off, the so-called Subterraneasns in Beijing are
just BS - ie, shit (and so much so I won't even be
willing to squeeze 'em out). And those who support
them, which includes Haas Bianchi, whom I respect
very, very much, are simply being duplicitous,
complitous, in what is 3000 years of autocratic rule -
and I don't need to hate them, because those who have
been either jailed, live in exile, or are dead can do
so of their own volition.

How do I know this, because, sad to say, I know China.
What does that mean: living in near Russian border,
Beijing, and next to Hong Kong, and teaching at
Tsinghua and working for the British Embassy. Knowing
writers who I won't name but who are in exile. And
let's not let Chinese linguists pretend they can
either dictate what is history, philosophy or politics
in what is probably one of the most represive and
rasist cultures in the world. And the thing is, the
Middle Kingdom uses the language of the West as a kind
of tool, but it don't and has no will to change. Fuck
me with your words and I will spit you he said,
relighting that flame which tingles you so -ew.

Second, some real bastards said some real crap and
really attacked a very good man who has a very real
track record of doing good, and that's Paul Catafago.
I reckon life is more than sitting at a PC, but rather
standing in the streets, working in not so fashionable
communities, speaking up when it's least appreciated.
I know this -- as do you, all those good people who
didn't speak up on his behalf because they were, well,
scared. But those poets, and there's this whitebread,
wonderbread, just read his work, let's see what
follows, that I've nicknamed BM are not evil-doers,
but evil-followers.

Just left Sri Lanka, third time in one year doing that
work with people who are special, have no voice, a
culture you all appropriate as if vanilla exlax were
more friendly than, well, a hot fudge sunday- and I
ask myslef, how much are words supposed to mean,
especially when there are lots of folk who've held
themselves so long arms just broke!

There are some great poets on Haas list- but Bm is
neither influence or a very good poet. Make me think
of the Baseball Hall of Fame, this list, and it is so
misleading. He has influenced nobody - his nobodiness
means nada. And my 6 publishing this years mean lots
more. For fuck sake, poetry mean, is, something - just
think about RC, Ginsburg, Duncan, WCM...geez. Oh man.

What would Robert Johnson - and I know evil like RJ -
say?

Hello yourself, Gabe.

It's no doubt very possible that I read your catalogue
as a more aggressive critique than you yourself see it
as, and if so, I guess that's one of those differences
so common in discussion land. What's aggressive and
what's gentle are themselves issues open to some
interpretation, obviously. Even if your words seemed
less kind-hearted to me than you felt them to be, and
if your cultural scripts struck me more as stereotypes
than as accurate observations, I'm still certainly
willing to accept that you intended them in a
different spirit than I initially understood--that is,
that you meant them as a chance to open a dialogue. My
apologies that I failed to see that that's what you
meant to do.

Whether there's much clear ground here between us, I'm
less sure of, and I say this (that is, I'm trying to
say this) with no desire to clash. I think we both
agree that poetry communities are complicated
entities, and that social power is distributed in them
unevenly, frequently along lines of not only gender,
but also race and class. But I think it's the very
idea that there's some unequivocal "clear ground"
regarding these questions that makes me distrustful.
I'd be genuinely interested in hearing which parts of
the ground you think are clear beyond the general
agreement we have that gender, race, and class (and, I
suppose, "manners," although the ground here becomes
less clear again, at least for me) are problems in
contemporary poetry communities and that all parties
should work to minimize those problems. How should
that be done? Do you have practical insights or
suggestions? Because once we move beyond those
conditions and into the behaviorial dynamics of groups
and individuals, I think there are ambiguities,
complexities, confusions, and paradoxes that don't
lend themselves that frequently to the idea of clear
ground.

With sincere good wishes--

Mark





Hi again, Mark.

As you might find my previous short response too
short, I provide this.

Your email asks me ten questions whose premises are
presumably
based on the contents of my post, but I don't follow
how you
arrived at those premises, not to mention the
questions. So, you urge
that I've misread you in a few ways, and you in turn
seem to be urging a
misreading of my post too. What to do?

I did, yes, come away seeing something abstract in yr
post, and I
suppose, yes, that I did use binaries. Never been able
to avoid those
pesky things. They're everywhere. Nor have I found a
text or writer who
could avoid them, including, I notice, you. :)

And I didn't, no, suggest that it's simply poetry
communities that
misuse people (I didn't mention misusing people at
all, in fact).

Nor would I think it accurate to say that my two posts
containing
sketches of, I think, 5 transactional games common to
some male poets on
listserves is me "attacking poetry communities
aggressively." Especially
given that I call the sketches a small catalog. I say
sketch and
catalog, using textual metaphors, which you then
reframe in military terms.

And I did not assert, not knowing you, that you would
do well to be
"more invested in real ethics," nor did I assert (as
you suggest that I
did) that you haven't seen sexism in poetry before.
Nor in fact was I
(as you assert) trying to state my sketches were
"truth" by saying
three-fourths who backchanneled encouragements were
women. And neither
did I anywhere "insist" on (and I'm using quote marks
here not to be
persnickety but just to remind others that these
aren't my words) an
"absolute rhetoric of the real" or "assign" myself the
"role of Pure
Knight of the Real."

I guess what I'm getting at is I seem to be doing a
lot of sweeping here
just to get back to (what I consider) clear ground,
and I'm beginning to
wonder if this exchange can remain a conversation.

But if you would like to have a conversation about
what I said in my
post, I'd be happy to.

Perhaps it would help if I forwarded a link in another
email, which I'll
do if I get time before heading to work.

My very best to you,

Gabe

What is it that's wrong again? I think i missed that part of the discussion.
this whole deal about gentleness and honesty or whatever, it strikes me as a little too meta, when in fact what's being proposed is just an alternative ethic which has to be defended on its own merits. I personally don't see anything particularly appealing in an ethic of gentleness vs an ethic of competitive snarkiness and that case has yet to be made for gabe's "gentleness." in fact, aesthetically, i find it a little too hippie and therefore sort of repugnant. my guess is the gentleness ethic can only be justified by appeals to analagous pursuits that aren't really relevant, and therefore holding it up as a superior mode of being in fact breaks down to personal preference at best and hippie snobbery at worst.

 -- living with someone who interfaces the contradictions between science
and faith, as my husband does, gives me inspiration to tackle the question
of internet communities as related to experience, which i think is similar
to the question of the poem and the lived experience -- that there is a leap
from the one to the other, but the one can help interpret the other, and the
other can help interpret the one -- experience seen through the refraction
of hte published object -- or the published object seen through the
refraction of experience -- so different from a diary of one's dreams? --
from each position the other is rendered changed in the viewer, with an
invitation to correction, to greater freedom:  i.e., to further discussion
and dialogue -- and those points of crucial egregious error can in fact open
up dialogue to greater truth -- it is a question of redemption in a way and
the distortions of the text can lead to redemptions of life -- if for
example Christ never was historically crucified, is that important because
the myth has given us a powerful story of crucifixion and redemption which
is mythically important -- but to that point i owe my husband's greater
intellect than mine -- he who strongly encouraged my career after grad
school so that's not a terribly unfeminist statement -- but i think it
holds, that the distortions of the text are like shovels into ground that
might be plowed, and plowed deeper -- so that internet publishing, or
contexts of poetry, as they become fluid in current times, also hold the
promise of deepening experiences of the very different "real" -- but that in
turn creates pressure that the "real" somewhere must be documented also, as
fact and as image of fact -- so that the internet prompts further dialogue
but so also does the documented real -- a poem written like a diary or such
-- two sides of a tennis court or something -- i myself favor the factual
real -- it is difficult to exist inside words only though at some point
worth trying out

that's my last post for today and i probably won't post until next week,
hope there's something useful here

*Girly Man* is now out from
The University of Chicago Press

read all about it at
http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/books/girly-man/


says Leslie Scalapino:
Charles Bernstein's poems in Girly Man are frequently series of
pairs, jingles of a 'public discourse' that purports to represent us
and by which Bernstein misrepresents us, the pairs being apparently
contrary to each other and from which we are to choose as if without
middle ground: "simultaneous double narrative/the space between's the
other narrative/as if they're opposite." In the space between,
outside representation but in the 'presence' of it, we are provoked
to laugh. Bernstein alters our language to open a double range that's
public and mind at once and inseparable, that is "Poetry is patterned
thought in search of unpatterned mind." Girly Man is doing it.

On a napkin of grass by concrete trees,
five hundred people squat and tumble
so a bunch of titans can grab their skulls
and toss them up the way they like it,
snappy in sunlight, with lawn chairs
as rocket packs or false coffins.

Nobody hears what they’re saying: It’s too beautiful.
Their words can’t hurt the ruling cash register
and so nobody has to be shot or re-educated.

Gabe (and others)--

I came across this short essay today, and it got me
thinking about your comment that Steve Irwin loved the
animals he used on his show (I didn't check your
earlier post--but I seem to recall the word love
there). At the time, I wasn't sure if you were being
ironic--because, to me, his love seemed like a tough
love if it was love at all. Anyway, here's this little
article from MSNBC which I think you'll find
interesting:

Best,
Joseph

Poets Take to the Road This Fall

http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sns-ap-poetry-bus-tour,0,2684650.story

NEW YORK -- Poetry fans, keep an eye out this fall for a Green
Tortoise bus.

Look beyond the bookstore or campus lecture hall. Try a ranch in
Missoula, Mont.; a sushi bar in Spokane, Wash.; or a church in
Providence, R.I. Peak inside this 40-foot coach, if you dare, and
expect to find beds, seating areas, work stations and, at any given
time, a couple of dozen road-tested poets.

The 2006 Poetry Bus Tour, billed as the "most ambitious poetry tour
ever attempted," is a voyage of verse that will cover 50 cities in 50
days, a pace that could wear out the most experienced politician or
rock star. The tour is being organized by Wave Books, a Seattle-based
poetry press.

"When my first book (`Things Are Happening') came out, I went on a 50-
stop tour, just by myself, in my car," says poet Joshua Beckman, an
editor at Wave Books and co-founder of the tour with fellow poet and
Wave Books editor Matthew Zapruder. "It reminded me of the way
musicians would tour, when you put something creative out, you drove
around and showed it to people. And my experience on that first tour
was so interesting, just going to all those places and meeting
people. I kept looking to expand on it, and share it with other people."

The tour, which includes both Wave and non-Wave poets, begins Labor
Day at the Bumbershoot Music Festival in Seattle and wraps up in late
October, back home at Seattle's Space Needle. An evolving cast of
poets, from eminences such as John Ashbery to writers who have yet to
be published, will join and leave along the way.

Some, like the 79-year-old Ashbery and fellow Pulitzer Prize winner
James Tate, will simply participate in readings. Others will stick
around longer, like 31-year-old Cole Heinowitz, who plans to spend
two nights on the bus in October.

"I think that cohabitation is a great way to break through boundaries
that otherwise don't get broken down, especially in the sometimes
professionalistic and distant world of poets. I also love the idea of
lying on my back and looking out the windows while we move at 60
miles per hour," says Heinowitz, whose books include "Daily Chimera"
and the upcoming "The Rubicon."

Readings will take place wherever open spaces are to be found, and,
ideally, food and accommodations provided. The tour will feature
stops at the First Unitarian Church in Providence; the Naval Academy
in Annapolis, Md.; the Butler Creek Ranch in Missoula; and, just
south of Madison, Wis., an organic farm run co-managed by poet Lisa
Fishman, who looks forward to two extended stays on the bus.

"I think it'll be a dream come true," says the 39-year-old Fishman,
whose third book, "The Happiness Experiment," is scheduled to come
out next year. "I think there'll be a lot of energy. I imagine a lot
of singing, because when you're traveling on the road, in an enclosed
space, I have a feeling you revert to that childhood activity of
singing on the bus."

Wave Books expects to burn through more than 1,500 gallons of gas and
more than 150 gallons of coffee. The caravan of poets will include a
filmmaker, two professional astrologers and continuous online updates.

Asked what he expects to happen when you throw together dozens of
poets -- male and female, average age 32 -- in an enclosed
environment for an extended time, Beckman laughs nervously, and a
little wickedly, then suggests two very different outcomes.

"People have different ideas what a poetry bus can be," he says. "A
lot of people think a poetry bus is the most boring thing you could
imagine, like a bus full of people incredibly quietly reading. Others
think about Ken Kesey and think it's going to be crazy, with nobody
wearing any clothes and lots of drugs.

"To be honest, if I really knew what was going to happen I wouldn't
be as excited as I am right now."

I like the part about "professionalistic and distant world of
poets".  Still trying to figure out what he meant by that.  Distant
from what?

Aaron,
Apologies for posting this to the list.
You read a poem of mine on RealPoetik, and sent a
message to the editor expressing a desire to
communicate with me. Did you receive my emails? I'm
concerned they may have ended up in a spam folder
somewhere.
Feel free to backchannel me, alexdickow9@yahoo.com.
Yours,
Alex

Hello again, Mark.

Very happy to see your post yesterday morning. I'd met my 2 post limit,
so had to wait to reply. I see I think quite clearly now what your point
is -- and certainly Tom Orange's brief email yesterday morning helped
articulate it (assuming his reading yesterday morning of my initial post
was consonant with yours).

The issue becomes for me a problem of how to speak in a positive,
affiliated way (problematic labels, to be sure) about concerns (or even
problems) inhering in the community -- without being on the one hand a
goody-goody (a thief of virtue) and on the other a hypocrite. And I can
see how you might be suspicious given that 8 yrs ago I myself played
"young turk" on this list.

What you see as stereotypes, I see as rough descriptions of roles around
which I've observed unfortunate emotional transactions. These for me are
very rough sketches of the way ideas, emotions and opinions -- not to
say reputations, jobs, and book publications -- are "moved" and
instantiated socially.

So, to follow up on Tom's very succinct email yesterday morning, unlike
the sketch of "maverick" or "revolution," I don't think poetry's
in a woeful state, nor was I trying to imply that I'm just the guy to
fix it. I think we as a community do a pretty good job being
who we are, doing what we do. But I do think there is a certain amount
of "game play" that isn't just about being fun and "the way things get
done" (I hope my use of quote marks isn't as annoying as I fear it cd be
considered).

I was -- after I thought about it a bit -- for instance quite heartened
that you thought my initial email was a bid to play "courtroom" and that
you were essentially refusing me the social permission to play that game.

As to whether we can find "clear ground" (in the way you use that
metaphor): in one sense, no, I don't think we can or should. My use of
that metaphor was frankly only a way to (hopefully gently) hint that I
was beginning to suspect that my post and thoughts were being willfully
misinterpreted. I got, in other words, suspicious.

Your excellent responses and our discussion here caused me to dip again
yesterday back into my volume of Wm James's essays on radical
empiricism, and was reading his little squib called "How Two Minds Can
Know One Thing." I thought you might get a kick out of the following as
it speaks to I think some of the difficulties we've faced of talking
about stuff like this in what you aptly call "discussion land":

"Experiences come on an enormous scale, and if we take them all
together, they come in a chaos of incommensurable relations that we can
not straighten out. We have to abstract different groups of them, and
handle these separately if we are to talk of them at all. But how the
experiences ever get themselves made, or why their characters and
relations are just such as they appear, we can not begin to understand.
.... then we have to confess that ... 'a feeling only is as it is felt,'
there is still nothing absurd in the notion of its being felt in two
different ways at once, as yours, namely, and as mine. It is, indeed,
'mine' only as it is felt as mine, and 'yours' only as it is felt as
yours. But it is felt as neither by itself, but only when 'owned' by our
two several remembering experiences, just as one undivided estate is
owned by several heirs." (fr. _The Writings of William James: A
Comprehensive Edition_, page 231,  ed. McDermott)

It's what we do with that basic ontological divide -- (do we assume it's
"clear ground" [a v. problematic thing to do, as you rightly point out
{i meant that metaphor in a limited way}], or do we in good faith assume
that we are dealing with a genuine affiliative being on the other end of
the line? -- it's what we do with that divide that makes us, and makes
our community.

And if the latter (proceed in good faith), how then do we deal with
difficult issues arising from doubt, error, rough speech, or intentional
pushing (whether powerplays, transactional games, ad hominem, willful
misprision, whathaveyou)?

I'll post a link in a subsequent email to maybe offer a description of a
game and a possible way of responding.

Very good wishes to you, Mark.

Gabe

Hello yourself, Gabe.

It's no doubt very possible that I read your catalogue
as a more aggressive critique than you yourself see it
as, and if so, I guess that's one of those differences
so common in discussion land. What's aggressive and
what's gentle are themselves issues open to some
interpretation, obviously. Even if your words seemed
less kind-hearted to me than you felt them to be, and
if your cultural scripts struck me more as stereotypes
than as accurate observations, I'm still certainly
willing to accept that you intended them in a
different spirit than I initially understood--that is,
that you meant them as a chance to open a dialogue. My
apologies that I failed to see that that's what you
meant to do.

Whether there's much clear ground here between us, I'm
less sure of, and I say this (that is, I'm trying to
say this) with no desire to clash. I think we both
agree that poetry communities are complicated
entities, and that social power is distributed in them
unevenly, frequently along lines of not only gender,
but also race and class. But I think it's the very
idea that there's some unequivocal "clear ground"
regarding these questions that makes me distrustful.
I'd be genuinely interested in hearing which parts of
the ground you think are clear beyond the general
agreement we have that gender, race, and class (and, I
suppose, "manners," although the ground here becomes
less clear again, at least for me) are problems in
contemporary poetry communities and that all parties
should work to minimize those problems. How should
that be done? Do you have practical insights or
suggestions? Because once we move beyond those
conditions and into the behaviorial dynamics of groups
and individuals, I think there are ambiguities,
complexities, confusions, and paradoxes that don't
lend themselves that frequently to the idea of clear
ground.

With sincere good wishes--

Mark

Mark and others,

There then above is that link. Basically the issue for me becomes how to
speak to difficult behavior in a way that is peaceful and making of
peace. Various problem-solving communities have for example speech codes
to facilitate this (refer to interlocutor, eg, in 3rd person; or do not
link someone's spoken name with a pejoration, eg, as on this list).
Fundamentally I think, because of the problem of blaming, a great part
of the answer lies in the practice of individuated askesis: if it is
incumbent on anyone to behave peacefully, it is *first* incumbent that
one oneself do so. A hard ideal.

As anyone knows who's read Christian's amazing book, Aristotle called it
"eunoia": beautiful mind, the mind that one must cultivate in order to
be an ideal friend. Plutarch also used the word (eunoia), referring to
as a kind of "mutual kindness." Siddhatta said that such a mind needed
to be cultivated, literally grown, and the word he used in Pali was
"bhavana": from the root "bhaw," to be, to grow, to become, to cultivate
-- which was, interestingly, his word for "meditation." Siddhatta's
answer then is that anyone who wishes to cultivate a peaceful mind must
first behave without harm and second meditate in order to cultivate the
wisdom necessary to act peacefully in a complex and at times violent
world. The part of his code of conduct most relevant I think for poets
in "discussion land" is the bit about "right speech" which he defined as
"Thus does she live as one who binds together those who are divided...a
peacemaker, a lover of peace...a speaker of words that make for peace."
He even gave 5 marks of such words: they are timely, true, gentle,
purposeful, and kindhearted.

All markers that beg definition surely, especially if one is trying to
speak to the harsh or verbally violent behavior of others. His answer is
volition-based: that one should never allow violence to be perpetrated
if it's possible to stop it while still retaining a peaceful mind. But
the link above for me more clearly articulates this "big" ideal with a
real-world (or what I *perceive,*[perhaps erroneously] to be) problem.
I'll post the link below too.

Gabe,

I really have to take issue with you here. First of all, to accept any buddhist thought on violence you have to first of all take for granted the buddha's axiom 1.) that life is suffering and 2.) that the annihilation of the self is the correct answer to that problem. Given my strong disagreement with the first premise and an inability to see how the second premise solves anything, and therefore appeals to buddhist thought rarely do much for me, i thought i'd take a second and consider the other side of what you're talking about in this post. That is, is there something laudable inherent in violent speech acts that your approach is ignoring?

I'll begin by noting that all of the thinkers you've quoted in defense of the ideal of calmness or gentleness or a beautiful mind, were themselves living in societies wherein slavery and classism was commonplace and unquestioned, indeed, was morally justified in some of the same documents wherein these "wise men" praised the beautiful mind ideal. Your link between Aristotle and The Buddha is particularly interesting to me, as I've always thought that the real link between eastern and western thought was present in Aristotle and Confucius. Specifically, the Aristotelian ideal of the Gentleman in response to the Socratic/Platonic "true philosopher," and it's parallels in the Confucian junzi or noble gentleman. I think you do an unfortunate revision of the texts when you take from the context that it is these people who should be cultivating the beautiful mind you speak of, and that such people
can only do so if they ignore the underlying cultural violence that their rigidly stratified societies enforce. When all of these thinkers speak of "eunoia" or whatever, they aren't speaking to everyone, they're speaking to the elite class of rulers who could afford to pay for their services as advisors and teachers, and who were educated enough to be able to read their works. As such, such highminded ideals presented in such morally debauched societies actually make a mockery of everything I think is good and valuable about human society. In fact the ethics of most ancient thinkers are crippled by the fact that their praise of beautiful behavior is in fact a smoke screen for the depravation that the class of thinkers institutes on aliens, women, slaves, and the various other underclasses on which their leisure time to be able to sit around pontificating about beatiful speech and gentleness
relied.

I say, in contrast to these unrealistic and in some cases outright dehumanizing ideas about trying to be gentle and kind in an unjust world wherein one is reaping the benefits of the unjustness of the situation, that maybe taking a dialectically opposite approach to your ideal of gentleness might be the best thing to do in order to arrive at a more humane and just mode of social conduct. To that end, one should not attempt to be gentle and develop a beautiful mind, but should in fact cultivate a psyche as chaotic and roiling as the mass of human culture itself. One should attempt to be spontaneous in the expression of the full range of human emotions rather than subsuming such "negative" emotions as anger, desire, and disdain as secondary and something to be controlled. Certainly there is something to be said about curtailing physical violence, but verbal violence? Verbal violence is a requisite
iconoclasm in an unjust and imperfect society. The rules of such a society being a normative kind of social grammar that can only be attacked grammatically, but moving to a gentle form of speech one hamstrings oneself to be able to effect any sort of social change. It's equivalent to needing to cut down a forest but denying from the outset the use of any tools other than those one might use to clean a house with.

Rather than eunoia, then, the mental ideal should be a form of controlled paranoia, and practice should be made in the making of violent, forceful speech acts, and such acts should be appreciated for the beautifully destructive forces that they are, rather than being criticized as somehow inferior to the sort of politesse that the ruling classes would to enforce on everyone as a means to cement their efete plutocratically ordained lifestyles.

yrs and looking forward to your response,
JFQ

--thanks for posting that link which is very interesting -- to each poetics
member for different reasons --

-- there is a great deal that could be said about these kinds of things --

-- a couple thoughts then back to work

-- one thing that occurs to me is the interpretative act as locus of truth
-- this seems to me to be what we count on for any public dialogue to be
meaningful, but can such a thing be, in the cynical view, there can never be
a reflection of the speaker in the world of representation -- instead the
world fills with anti-speakers, anti-truths, and these phantoms are what
becomes the public world  -- but to dwell on the question of whether such
distortions should be permitted, when they are never entirely avoided --  if
anyone decides what words mean, which i realize is another possibility, of
course not rationally but if a world like that existed, it's an exaggeration
of the joke about poor people that they believe everything they read, and
all people are poor in some sense, the antithesis of which is a cynical
world in which nothing is believable -- even so the utopia where symbolic
violence does not occur is indeed important and this seems the point, the
question is where is that world located -- and i've always thought the
sciences know something the humanists don't on that score, the ability to
spend years or even decades observing ferns, without concern for language
applied to them -- observation -- that world is not a mute world but neither
does it have the same kinds of symbols -- this is the problem of the
nonviolence the people who are nonviolent are not the ones who bear the
responsibility for stopping violence they are the ones who point to a
different utopia where nonviolence makes agression a waste of time -- the
old joke from LBJ

The aide responded, "Jeezus, LB, we can't call the guy a pig-f&%!er!!"

And LBJ quipped, "I don't want to. I just want to make him deny it."

Hi There--

There are still a couple of openings for my fall prose workshop.
Below is my original call for students.

I've decided to revise the class a bit.  We'll begin with assignments
and gradually segue into an open-ended workshop when students feel
like it's time/when people have projects they feel like continuing
working on.

Best,
Dodie

--------------------

Writing Experiments Workshop
Dodie Bellamy

This fall I will be leading a writing experiments workshop, which
will meet 11 Monday evenings, from 7 to 10 p.m.  The dates:
September 25 through December 4.  Cost: $350, with a $100 deposit due
by September 18.

Each week students will be assigned a short take-home writing
experiment which they will share with the class the following week.
Assignments will range from cut ups to exploring bodily sensations.
Each week we will also critique longer pieces by two students.
Students may bring in anything they want (up to 20 pages) for the
longer critiques.  Depending on the length, these longer pieces will
be read aloud in class or handed out a week ahead of time.  Though
this class will have a prose focus, it is cross-genre, and poets are
welcome.  The class is limited to 9 students.  Lots and lots of
personal attention.  It takes place in San Francisco, in my South of
Market apartment, which comes complete with snacks and two cats.

This is a good class for poets wanting to play around with narrative
or prose writers wanting to open up their prose.  It will be the last
workshop I'll be doing for a while.

Pink Steam, my collection of fiction, memoir, and memoiresque essays,
was published in 2004 by San Francisco's Suspect Thoughts Press.  My
vampire novel, The Letters of Mina Harker was reprinted by University
of Wisconsin Press, also in 2004.  Academonia, a book of essays, is
forthcoming from Krupskaya late fall.  I'm the author of 3 other
books and I teach creative writing at SF State and in the MFA program
at Antioch Los Angeles.  I've also taught at CalArts, Naropa summer
session, Mills, USF, UC Santa Cruz, and the SF Art Institute.  I've
received the Bay Guardian Goldie Award for Literature and the
Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Poetry.

If you're interested, please email about work samples, etc.  Or--if
you know anybody who might be interested, please pass this email
along to them.  If you're interested do contact me promptly.
Preference given to those not currently enrolled in a grad writing
program.

Hello Jason and Gabe:

I appreciate many of the issues you raise. I've about
had my say on this topic, but I'd add a few last
points.

Jason, I agree with you that setting standards for
what might be considered proper modes of social speech
isn't a good idea and is immediately ridden with
problems of class and status bias--not to mention
completely impossible in any practical sense. And the
idea that "violent speech" as you define it should go
away is also similarly untenable. That said, verbal
violence and physical violence can't be purely
separated from each other--I'm not sure whether you
were implying that they could. For instance, male
physical violence towards women is often indirectly
encouraged by environments that directly encourage
hostile male speech about women. As you imply, though,
trying to legislate such language out of existence is
a problem the moment you try to imagine who would do
that legislating, and on what grounds (and for what
purposes) they would do it. I stand more with what Al
Nielsen likes to say about these things: the solution
to the problems of free speech is more free speech.

Also, there are differences between the problems
within poetry communities, which I was talking about,
and the problems of living under late capitalism
generally, which you were talking about. Of course,
both are worthy subjects. In any case, as you said in
an earlier post, it's all just a little too meta: on
some level, the best answers about how to talk to
people can only be found case by case, even if one
does choose some basic principles to stand by.

Gabe, I think it's interesting and original that you
use a philsophical/Buddhist framework to talk about
these sort of speech act/behavior games. These kinds
of behavioral questions are more commonly approached
through sociology, psychology, and my still favorite
writing focused on human interaction: fiction. Fiction
continues to provide a rich ground for understanding
the complex ways that people get along or not with
each other in all sorts of communities. How's that for
a wild generality? But I like the fact that you're
coming at these questions from an innovative angle.

I have to admit, though, that in looking at your
"Courtroom" link I still feel like your approach is
caught a little uncomfortably between an attempt at
objective social description and an attempt at
mean-spirited (if often funny) satire. I get the sense
that the center point of these descriptions is the
unreflective, self-asserting male ego, and that you
pin a lot of your analysis on the assertion that those
egos are at the center of the world even of
"alternative" poetries. At least for the moment, I
find the social games as described in, say, the work
of Erving Goffman to be more nuanced and thorough,
less likely to pin all social ills on the idea of the
will-to-dominate male in love with his own image. But
in any case I wish you good luck in continuing your
attempt, and I have no doubt that there are many
reasons for critiquing men of that kind, because they
do a lot of damage.

Keep on keeping on--

Mark

Gabe,

When I first read your initial post which started this line of discussions, I knew immediately the specific person many of your comments were referring to. From what expired on this list and on Lucipo afterwards, it is clear that I was not the only one who had this impression.

Given this situation, I have one question. If the point of your reference was basically so clear,why did you not mention the name but used a third person? Is this not itself a rhetorical device, in your terms, a transactional gesture.

Enlighten me.

Ciao,

Murat

Hi Heidi and Jason and Mark,

About violence and a pacific utopia.

(Mark, I know you're out the door, so will just say thanks for yr
engagement. I enjoyed your conversation.)

I'm not sure that I was clear, or the passage about nonviolence was
clear: nonviolence does not mean pacificism. An ethics of gentleness
isn't an ethics of patsy-ism. Nonviolence means stopping violence. It
does not mean succumbing to it. It's a common misunderstanding, but not
even the Buddha was a pacifist. Sometimes hard action is necessary,
whether hard verbal action or hard physical action. The buddha's only
point was that one must tend one's own mind, to make it gentle, even
when standing up to folks who are, well, thick. Ignorant people (and I
don't mean uneducated, I mean people who don't have control of their
minds) are dangerous. They sometimes have to be opposed vigorously. Like
most people, I've (even recently) found it necessary in my life to stand
up to manipulative intimates -- one of whom was at times physically
violent -- and to get away from them. Vipassana has helped in that
tremendously. Gentleness is not about inaction or inanition.

The Buddha did not advocate for world peace, nor point to a Utopia. I
think what I find compelling about the buddhadhamma is that it
recognizes the array of volitional possibilities, temperaments, life
forces, found in the human community and the wider community of beings,
each particular being having its own capacity for understanding, wisdom
and action. The world, like, is a very complex place. Insight based on
"satipatthana," or the firm establishing of awareness and equanimity
through vipassana meditation, is the only possible way, the Buddha
suggested, to *first* fully recognize the complexity of the misery
around one, and *second* not succumb to it, and third to help others out
of it. Sometimes hard action is necessary to help others not hurt
themselves or others.

I have found no more effective ethic anywhere. And my gratitude for the
simple, laser-like practice of vipassana is pretty well boundless.

Jason, as to whether gentleness is possible only for rich people: it's
the most educated and richest countries that are the most violent.
Gandhi, as with Ambedkar, worked closely with Untouchables training them
to act gently but forcefully. Or for a huge modern day example: Just
take a look at Tihar Prison in India. Over ten thousand very very poor
people have festered in that place for decades. This is the largest
prison in India. Very violent. For over twelve years now two
free-of-charge ten day silent vipassana courses are taught in that
prison each month. Prior to Vipassana courses being taught there, it was
the most violent prison in India. Now its pacific. The people are still
poor. Its rates of murder, theft and rape have plummeted. An award
winning documentary was made about the teaching of vipassana in that
prison, if you're interested: DOING TIME, DOING VIPASSANA (1997,i
think). Many many vipassana courses have been taught in prisons in
Seattle (dropping recidivism rates precipitously), British Columbia, and
a maximum in Alabama. I've started writing programs in three prisons:
the people who benefit most from having a peaceful mind are the
inmates,and the inmates families, not the guards, not the state
apparatus. Truly cultivating one's mind through vipassana brings one to
a life of action, not 'yeah man that's groovy.'

You mentioned slavery, Jason. The example of Epictetus stands out. The
most influential philosopher of his day, some say of the first
millennium, more influential in his day than Plato, someone who
profoundly affected Aurelius, Emerson, Wm James. Born Greek, he lived
much of his life as a slave, was brutally beaten and hobbled by his
Roman master, and lived almost the entirety of his life under privation
and hunger, ending it in exile and poverty, lame and crippled -- because
of the cruelty of an entire society. But he refused to blame, and
refused to relinquish a mindstate of goodwill and self-determination.
His lectures are pretty dang inspiring.

Or Viktor Frankl, who survived not just one extermination camp, but four
-- Theresienstadt, then Auschwitz, then Kaufering and Turkheim, the
latter two being adjuncts of Dachau -- and who said, "We who lived in
concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts
comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have
been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can
be taken from a person but one thing: the last of the human freedoms --
to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose
one's own way."

My point: Cultivating one's mind and living gently is not a luxury
dependent on circumstance. Or if it is, it is one that luxury destroys.
Tolstoy said, and I'm inclined to agree, "unhappiness is the fatal
result, not of our need, but of our abundance."--  fr. _War and Peace_,
as quoted in William James' essay "On a Certain Blindness in Human
Beings," as found in THE WRITINGS OF WILLIAM JAMES: A COMPREHENSIVE
EDITION (McDermott, ed.), page 641.

This has been a v. long-winded post. That LBJ joke rocks.

Much warmth to you both.

Gabe

--thanks for posting that link which is very interesting -- to each poetics
member for different reasons --

-- there is a great deal that could be said about these kinds of things --

-- a couple thoughts then back to work

-- one thing that occurs to me is the interpretative act as locus of truth
-- this seems to me to be what we count on for any public dialogue to be
meaningful, but can such a thing be, in the cynical view, there can never be
a reflection of the speaker in the world of representation -- instead the
world fills with anti-speakers, anti-truths, and these phantoms are what
becomes the public world  -- but to dwell on the question of whether such
distortions should be permitted, when they are never entirely avoided --  if
anyone decides what words mean, which i realize is another possibility, of
course not rationally but if a world like that existed, it's an exaggeration
of the joke about poor people that they believe everything they read, and
all people are poor in some sense, the antithesis of which is a cynical
world in which nothing is believable -- even so the utopia where symbolic
violence does not occur is indeed important and this seems the point, the
question is where is that world located -- and i've always thought the
sciences know something the humanists don't on that score, the ability to
spend years or even decades observing ferns, without concern for language
applied to them -- observation -- that world is not a mute world but neither
does it have the same kinds of symbols -- this is the problem of the
nonviolence the people who are nonviolent are not the ones who bear the
responsibility for stopping violence they are the ones who point to a
different utopia where nonviolence makes agression a waste of time -- the
old joke from LBJ

The aide responded, "Jeezus, LB, we can't call the guy a pig-f&%!er!!"

And LBJ quipped, "I don't want to. I just want to make him deny it."

Hi Murat,
I've talked about this before on Lucipo. 3rd person is common courtesy.
Beyond that: not exclusively about one person; structural focus; not
wishing to fuel an economy of attention or scandal. All while still
talking about structural issue. A rhetorical device is not a
transactional game. Far as I can see anyway.
I wrote brief essay touching on yr question: "Literary Narcissism and
the Manufacture of Scandal." It's on my blog somewhere if you're interested.
Gabe

PARK YOURSELF:
CITYWIDE PARKING SPACE PROJECT

September 8th - September 16th
a free series
of actions & performances
throughout Chicago

Schedule and Map at
http://tallskinny.com/parkyourself/

Performers include:
Beatriz Albuquerque, Mike Benedetto, Jens Brasch, Mary
and Anna Carvlin, Chance of Showers, Anthony Cobb, JB
Daniel, Vesna Grbovic, Nancy Juda, Jennifer Karmin,
Burleigh Kronquist, Javier Lara, Robin Morrissey, Phil
Passen, PEOPLE, Scott Ian Ray, Jenny Roberts, Paul
Lloyd Sargent, Ben Shepard, Subtext Dance Company, The
Space/Movement Project, Marija Topalovic, Sallie Wolf,
Mike Yong

WHY SHOULD CARS BE PRIVILEGED?
Participants, including performance artists, dancers,
musicians, visual artists, activists and non-artists,
will “rent” parking spaces throughout the city by
paying the requisite amount for the time.
Theoretically, this payment authorizes and entitles
them to use the space in any way they choose.

When we temporarily free ourselves from automatic
assumptions about the urban spaces we navigate daily,
we can imagine new uses and invent new ways of
entering those spaces, thus liberating ourselves — and
perhaps those around us.

Quick survey for you all.  What has been your experience with
receiving & sending media mail?  Media mail is dramatically cheaper
than first class, ups ground etc & I've been starting to use it for
sending out Xexoxial orders.  Delivery dates seem fairly
unpredictable, ranging from a few days to weeks, but other than that
it seems to be a good deal.  Has anyone had problems or issues with
Media mail?  Missing, damaged, etc?   How do you feel about having to
wait longer?  Anyone else using it to send out their wares and how is
it working for you?

mIEKAL,

I have always used Media Mail for mailing out each issue of Sentence and
for mailing books in general. I would say about 2 or 3% of each issue
never reaches its destination and has to be reshipped. USPS reserves the
right to open Media Mail to confirm that it meets the rate requirements,
and I suspect that they actually do that, especially when they see a big
shipment. And, yes, delivery times range from a couple days to several
weeks, and distance to delivery doesn't seem necessarily to correlate to
delivery times. It's not terribly reliable, but the savings are worth it.
At least for us.

Brian

Hi mIEKAL

Media Mail works very well for me. Usually, it doesn't take much longer than
first-rate mail and over the long haul it saves me money that I can use for
other things, e.g. paper and toner cartridges and more stamps.

So far, I've had no problems with media mail getting lost. I think it's a
good deal, much better than the Special 4th Class Rate for manuscripts used
to be.

 >>The buddha's only point was that one must tend one's own
mind, to make it gentle, even when standing up to folks who
are, well, thick.


Heinrich Zimmer has a great section about the bitter rivalry
between the followers of Buddha and the followers of
Goshala. Buddha taught that one can be freed from the wheel
of rebirth. His followers started drafting (in)action plans
to get off the wheel of births.

Goshala, on the other hand, taught that everyone has 80,000
incarnations, not one more or one less. If you are suffering
in ignorance, according to Goshala, it is because you have
just started to reincarnate; if you are happy and
enlightened, it is because you have already lived many
lives. There's not a thing you can do about it.

The Buddhists hated the Mandukarin for undermining their
(non-) self-help program. So human and so amusing.

I use media mail. All media goes from your post office to a local processing
center, and this does cause a delay. I have had packages lost, but it is
rare. For shipping in the continental U.S., it's worth the savings, BUT if
you are shipping to Hawaii or Alaska, media mail goes by BOAT (yikes) and
can take over a month to arrive to its destination! In these cases, I use
first class.

best,
Laura

by "how it's done" i was meaning "how do you read this stuff?" Do i just treat it like i do visual art or is there more to it than that? this whole visual poetry thing has me completely baffled.

Hello everybody--
      I've been reading Gabe's epistles with a sense of daily anticipation,
thinking of them as a feuilleton in the battle between good and evil, with
Gabe playing a variety of roles--the White Knight Protector of Damsels in
Distress, the Vigilante Man prowling the wild frontiers of listservs, the
Homeland Security Agent ever vigilant, or quite simply as one of the most
loving beings on the planet.  Some days I can almost feel him levitate and
his canonization draw near, like various Saints in Blaise Cendrars' Sky
Memoirs.  Love pours forth from his words like light from Van Gogh's
Sunflowers. That is, love with one exception--his unswerving intolerance for
the unnamable evil ones with whom he does hard battle in the name of the
rest of the community.
     I keep thinking that these letters belong to a very real genre of
American literature and oral tradition, and of old country and blues songs,
for which I have no name as yet.  I keep hearing Huck Finn's voice in the
back of my mind as I read, as well as the voices of so many speakers I have
heard down through the years, and the comments of myself and friends  on
their talks.  I think of scenes in Mickey Spillane, in which Mike Hammer
suddenly realizes that it is not vengeance he is after, but the work of the
Lord that he is going to  perform.  And there's Jim Thompson's Pop. 1280, in
which the throughly corrupt Sheriff has an epiphany in which he sees that
the tawdry series of killings he has to perform are actually beautiful, for
they are labors in the fields of the Lord.
      What intrigued me from the start is in the very first letters Gabe
wrote with such great vehemence of a person on another listserv, attacking
this person pretty viciously, yet citing only an example or two of sketchy
evidence of the person's crimes.   I gathered in this way, that  the person
one moment could be a person, and the next a type--"maverick" or
"revolutionary" in the  typology Gabe borrows from Eric Berne's Games People
Play.  At the same time, Gabe was writing of the Buddha and loving
kindness--and  I thought, this wil be very interesting, to see how these
opposing strands of emotions are reconciled--great personal dislike, yea
verily unto Ahabian obsessive vengeance--and near universal loving kindness.
         It's a very American theme--I have come to know God/Buddha's true
words, true reality, I see truly the dangers of the world and must protect
the community from them.  Hard words, hard action!  may be used against
undesirable people if one has loving kinddess and peace in one's mind.  As
Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) says in Taxi Driver:  "I'm God's lonely man."
So it is that this hard duty has fallen on Gabe, to protect the community
from the unnamable ones--for even though the unnamable ones are far away, on
some other list serv, there are sure to be others out there also , just
waiting to invade. Which does make you wonder--why is all of this occuring
here in the first place?  Or does Gabe answer that when he remarks a number
of times that he has learned to walk away from situations where there is
violence (he implies violence from the unnamable one)? Has he walked away to
come here and bring his warnings?  To bring protection?  And even perhaps to
begin ferreting out any possible threats concealed within?  Gabe also
introduces the theme of the courtroom at one point and dispenses with
it--the transactional courtroom, however, not the courtroom of law, in which
the accused has the right to face the accuser.  Is that perhaps why the
unnamable one is unnamed?  To keep things out of court?
     At first the epistles sputtered a bit, trying to overcome the tension
between the raging at the unnamed ones and the loving kindness of the
meditation.  This seemd to be resolved when  Gabe revealed that letters of
support to him on the other listserv  ran to three quarters of them being
from women.  Gabe even cites one of these notes.  Buoyed by the revelation
he is the White Knight of Silenced Women (since that great moment have women
been writing much more on that list?)--Gabe begins to breathtakingly reveal
in letter after letter his true goodness, his true understanding of the
teachings of Buddha, his true grasp of his mission.  It's beautiful to see
him spread his wings and take flight.
      I'm not that widely read in spiritual traditions, I do know in Chuang
Tzu, the Gospels and St Augustine, it is taught that a person who
prays/meditates and lives a good life, practices good conduct etc--doesnt
make a public show of this.  One doesnt go around telling the world  how
much one prays/meditates or does it in public, or announces to the world how
good one is, how very good one has become.  True, one hears people say, I am
a better person than I used to be because of the teachings.  That's
different from I am a better person than the unnamed ones because of the
teaching and so am fit to judge them--and hard!  And because I am such a
better person I am fit to judge any others that come along who dont toe the
line.  I am filled with so much loving kindness and discernment that I can
be very hard and take hard action--a good cop bad cop routine in other
words.
     I have been enjoying these so much in a a gallows humor way as they
remind me of various people have heard over the years.  I shared them with
some of my pals--read them aloud and then  would go over them--and we'd
think of who it sounded like.  There's one guy we know who actually has  rap
not unlike Gabe's--it's all about a lot of love--except he has  one rival
dude he always has to bring up and warn against, like dude is satan, snake
in the grass, waiting for you in your moment of weakness.  And this dude,
we'll call him C. C. he KNOWS Jesus, the way Gabe knows Buddha--and Jesus is
a tough cat, too.
      You see what we always listen for is that "giveaway" in the
preaching--all that love and kindness and all--and the preacher, the
speaker, the meditator, just so beautiful  and pure--yet always in all of
them at some point there is a kernal of hate, vengeance, intolerance, that
is the engine driving them--that they can't let go of.  It all sounds so
beautiful and reasonable, music to the ears--until you listen closer and
realize, wait a minute, if dude can exclude one person what's to keep him
from excluding more--and excluding you, yourself, for reasons completely
arbitrary?  And if dude (Gabe)  is talking on this list about some dudes on
another list, how do you know dude isn't talking about you on some other
list somewhere else?  What's to make you think you can trust a word he has
to say?
         And if dude (Gabe) has to come over here to attack some dudes who
are over there--and make himself out a hero here--by attacking a dude who
can't defend himself--what's there to respect in that?  See what I'm saying?
          As much as I've enjoyed in a way reading the amazing series of
sidesteppings and rationalizations and contradictions and denials of these
letters they also really sadden me.  The amount of animosity, rage, venom
and vengeance, let alone scheming that the machinations of these letters
display, al the time and effort that must go into their composing, betrays
everything you write about loving kindenss, Gabe. To have such a poison in
yourself will poison your life--it is now--and also is poisoning those
around you by sending these letters.  It's not bringing loving kindness into
the world, that's for sure.  You can't con a bunch of old cons.  As lowly
and unglamourous as it sounds, maybe you and the other gentleman should meet
and work things out--and maybe with a mediator.  See a counselor if need be
as they say.  My pals and I aren't kidding.  It can be kind of raw but it
works.  All this energy spent on vengeance destruction, negativity and
rationalizations--you could be writing poems! Have a life!  Really meditate
on loving kindness instead of al this nonsense about cultural types which
sounds like profiling for a hit list.
The Buddhas i like to think about are the first 25 who were never known of
publically/historically--to live simply and almost anonymously as a
Buddha--my gosh with listserv at your command already must be abt a thousand
people know about your loving kindness and hard action protecting Damsels in
Distress and the community from the villains you have idenitifed with your
profiling system of  typologies and scripts (to quote the title of a Blue
Cheer reissue collection on Rhino Records, you're "Louder then God"!)--maybe
time to give being Superman a break and be human for a while--
"and enter the splendid cities" (Rimbaud)

WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT
=20
EXPERIMENTAL WRITING WORKSHOP =AD LARRY FAGIN
TUESDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 10TH
=20
=B3Why do we see certain kinds of writing as "experimental?"  What makes this
writing different than conventional writing?  This workshop is open to
writers of poetry and prose, who are willing to examine traditional methods
and styles, and to question the assumptions that make up the concept of
"self-expression."  In what ways do a line, a stanza, a sentence, or a
paragraph perform strangeness or surprise?  What is the crucial difference
between earnestness and sincerity?  We will use two key ideas as tools of
inquiry.  One is sprezzatura, a 14th century Italian term that translates
loosely as "making something look effortless."  The other is
Fingerspitzengefuehl, variously translated as "sensitive touch" or
"intuition." Every writer has habitual strategies, which they tend to
repeat. How can one abandon, if only temporarily, these habits, and explore
other possibilities? What have you got to lose?  Authors referenced include
Whitman, Apollinaire, Cendrars, Stein, Khlebnikoff, Pessoa, Dos Passos, Jan=
e
Bowles, Pound, Williams, Moore, Riding, Olson, Creeley, Spicer, children=B9s
writing and found writing.=B2 Larry Fagin edits Adventures in Poetry books an=
d
Sal Mimeo magazine, teaches at The New School, and writes in the afternoon.
=20
=20
TRANSLATE THIS! =AD MARCELLA DURAND
THURSDAYS at 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 12TH
=20
=B3Translation is a highly charged and highly problematic way to apprehend th=
e
=B3foreign/other.=B2 We translate the emotional, physical and spoken worlds
about us, rendering them into our own realms of the (in)comprehensible.
We=B9ll discuss ethical, political, economic and practical issues of
translating various languages, both inter- and intranational. We=B9ll also
talk about translating natural and unnatural happenings, objects, patterns
and chaos. We=B9ll translate visual and aural experiences. Sometimes we=B9ll
leave things untranslated and utterly mysterious. Readings include Francis
Ponge, Nicole Brossard, Teresa Hak Jyung Cha, Tina Darragh, Paula Claire,
and others.=B2 Marcella Durand is the author of The Anatomy of Oil, Western
Capital Rhapsodies, City of Ports and Lapsus Linguae. She has translated
French writers, including Jean-Michel Espitallier and Mich=E8le M=E9tail, as
well as geological formations, corporate-speak, and construction sites into
pseudo-=B3American=B2 tongues.
=20
=20
SATIRE AS CULTURAL ENGAGEMENT =AD GARY SULLIVAN
FRIDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 13TH
=20
=B3Satire insists on a level of cultural engagement not always required by
other approaches to creative expression. We will read, listen to, and watch
satirical work from around the world and across millennia=8Bfrom ancient
Greece to contemporary Afghanistan and Zimbabwe, with many points in
between. Global examples will be our temporary touchstones as we hone our
own cultural engagement in our poetry. Participants don=B9t need to be funny,
just observant.=B2 Gary Sullivan is the author of How to Proceed in the Arts,
Swoon (with Nada Gordon), and two issues of the comic book series,
Elsewhere.
=20
APPLIED POETICS =AD KRISTIN PREVALLET
SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 14TH
=20
=B3Bringing together the curriculum programs of The Poetry Project and the
Bowery Poetry Club, this workshop in applied poetics will present a
meandering survey of contemporary praxis in both page and stage traditions:
the focus will be on poets who write about their own process and through
this act create the discourse called "poetics." Emphasis will be on reading
(most of it done in class); much of the discussion will take place through
shared writing. This reading/writing continuum will synthesize into your ow=
n
poetic statement and / or performance -- and hopefully will work to
clarifying your writing practice.=B2 Kristin Prevallet is the author of Shado=
w
Evidence Intelligence (Factory School, 2006). She is a co-founder of Study
Abroad on the Bowery: A Certificate Program in Applied Poetics at the Bower=
y

Gabe (in re especially Murat's remarks),
I'm going to speak up now.
I think people have been trying to (more discreetly
than here) suggest to you that your remark toward our
fellow lucipudlian was inappropriate -- but rather
than actually address this directly, you seem content
to fall back on your buddhist discourse. What I find
objectionable for starters is neither the third-person
reference nor the actual reproach, but the fact that
you speak about this on the Buffalo list (I believe
this kindo of crosslist discussion/warfare is
explicitly discouraged). I find that what the French
call "sournois" -- underhanded, a little sneaky.
In addition, although I think it is a shame so few
women speak up on Lucipo, I don't understand precisely
what you and X's beef happens to be, once again, and I
just think the tension between you two is really
annoying. If anything, I'd say we have two "mavericks"
vying for territory.
Prove me wrong, please do. I happen to really enjoy
your work, and I think your posts are mostly very
intelligent and stimulating, so I'm hoping this is
a...misunderstanding.
Yours,
Alex

Dave,
Oh yeah, ditto on some of that.
Have either you or Gabe read Francois Rabelais?
Might be a good idea.

MUSEUM'S NEWSLETTER

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Dear Friends,

Spring starts in Rio in September, so that, during this month we will have a
Poetry Festival hapenning through this newsletter. In fact it was influenced
by the wonderful Padín's idea of comemorating 50 years of Brazilian Concrete
Poetry (see the previous newsletter). During the "I Museum's Newsletter
Poetry Festival" I am intending to show many kinds of Brazilian Poetry to
you. Also it will be interesting if you send me links or texts about the
poetry of your country. I believe that this change of information should be
very rich to all of us.

To start I prepared a surprise to you, a pdf book (
http://arteonline.arq.br/museu/library_pdf/visual_poetry.htm )with two
movements of visual poetry which were born in Rio de Janeiro:

1)- The Neoconcrete

Around the late 1950s, the Rio group carried out an en-masse critical review
of their previous position. They denounced the excessive dogmatism that led
to Concretism, the production of art according to formulas that ended up
submitting it to a system devoid of critical or artistic potential instead
of integrating art into life.

As a result, the NeoConcretist Manifesto was published in the Sunday
Supplement of the Jornal do Brasil newspaper on March 23, 1959. The First
NeoConcrete Art Exhibition showed works by Lygia Clark, Lygia Pape, Amílcar
de Castro, Franz Weissmann, Reynaldo Jardim, Sergio Camargo, Theon Spanudis
and Ferreira Gullar. Other exhibitions followed, in which other artists took
part.

More at: http://arteonline.arq.br/museu/library_pdf/visual_poetry.htm

This essay was based on Lygia Pape deposition to myself, the English version
was done by Sabrina Gledhill)

2)- The Process Poem

This tendency of the Brazilian concrete poetry arises from the Wlademir
Dias-Pino work and it is the basis of the Process Poem, which was Born in
1967 / Rio de Janeiro.

The moviment called Process Poem was an action founded in 1967, which
happened simultaneously in Brazil's several regions: here in Rio de Janeiro,
in Natal, in Recife and in Minas Gerais. The action of the Process Poem
developed from 1967 to 1972 and ended up having about 250 artists taking
part on it.

The Process Poem was based on the concept of process, which would be the
starting point of the creation...


More at: http://arteonline.arq.br/museu/library_pdf/visual_poetry.htm

This essay was based on Neide Sá deposition to myself and on Clemente Padín
essay "La Poesia Experimental Latino Americana (1950 - 2000)"
http://boek861.com/padin/indice.htm (in Spanish),  English Version by Regina
Célia Pinto, tell me the about the very bad mistakes please!)


*************************************************

 Reading about the movement called Process Poem, at the first sight you will
think that they were very radical -  they tore books of discursive poets at
the steplathers of Municipal Theater, Rio de Janeiro. I really do not agree
with this, but perhaps it was only a way to call attention to their
movement. I know, for example, that Álvaro de Sá studied and loved deeply
the Luís de Camões' Poetry.



By the way, I am sending some links of one of the best Brazilian Poets:



CARLOS  DRUMMOND DE ANDRADE

http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/1471.html

http://www.webdelsol.com/Perihelion/drummond.htm



Here a very famous poem by him:


In  The Middle of Road


In the middle of the road there was a stone
there was a stone in the middle of the road
there was a stone
in the middle of the road there was a stone.

Never should I forget this event
in the life of my fatigued retinas.
Never should I forget that in the middle of the road
there was a stone
there was a stone in the middle of the road
in the middle of the road there was a stone.

 -- Carlos Drummond de Andrade (Translate into English by Elizabeth Bishop)

Greetings.

I am writing to ask for your help & submissions to Columbia New
Poetry's new NYC poetry calendar.  We are starting today from slate.
If you are aware of relevant events that will take place in NY in the
coming year, please take a moment to submit event info.  Also, please
notify anyone else who may have dates to add.  Submissions can be
made at http://www.columbia.edu/cu/newpoetry/calendar/cal_submit.html


Why?  This calendar is built to encourage participation in NY
"fringe" poetry communities.  We do not want to replicate the broad
listing at poetz.com.  We do not want to process 100's of weekly open
mic events & TBD's.  Rather, we want to present a succinct list of
the compelling poetry and poetry-related events going on in the city
each week - important happenings, small series, and events that would
otherwise find no wider mention.  This calendar will serve not as
publicity but as community, discourse, & topography.  Links on the
side of the Web site ( http://www.columbia.edu/cu/newpoetry ) will
give a good sense of the online context of the new NYC poetry calendar.

Thank you for your time & help.  I hope you will find the calendar of
use.

Copper Canyon Press is pleased to announce the publication of So What: =
New and Selected Poems 1971-2005  by Palestinian poet and fiction writer =
Taha Muhammad Ali.=20

So What is the first American publication of Muhammad Ali's career, and =
the first Arabic translation ever published by Copper Canyon Press. The =
book, which Publishers Weekly calls "timely and affecting," has the =
Arabic script facing the English translation. =20

"During this time of conflict, the publication of a bilingual Arabic =
book like So What takes on an especially poignant meaning for us," =
explains Copper Canyon's Executive Editor Michael Wiegers. "It's an =
unignorable book. We hope to humanize the news coming from the Middle =
East, and Taha's poetry does that, and more."

In late September Muhammad Ali will fly from Nazareth to New Jersey and, =
accompanied by his translator Peter Cole, embark on reading tour =
throughout the United States. His first stop will be as an international =
headliner at the Dodge Poetry Festival. In addition to headlining at the =
U.S.'s most renowned poetry festival, Muhammad Ali will read at an urban =
church, a poetry center, a university, and for students in a rural town:

Gabe,

The problem with what you are saying ("3rd person is common curtesy") is that your posts were anything but courteous. You basically accused another person of manipulating his own son for his own purposes, without naming names, therefore inhibiting that person from responding directly. Is that a courteous gesture or a hit and run tactic?

I remember those discussion around rap music on the Lucipo List. I did not see anything narcissistic on his part (I did read your essay immediately after your initial post); his comments suggested an openness towards his son and his friends and an attempt to integrate their sensibility into his poetry, to learn from it. Is that narcissistic (unless you are claiming he made up the whole thing, which I do not believe you are)?

Being a dad of two kids, I can only say that if someone had impugned a similar thing about me, I would not have been so patient. I would immediately have pounced on that person's jugular.

What I am trying to say is that, in my view, your assertions about Buddhism and peace do not jive with the tone of your comments the last few weeks. Your third person arguments appear to me basically as a device to tie down your opponent, a classical verbal power play.

I have been a long time admirer of your work and wit though I wish it were a bit less involved with "universals," as it is now. I remember your thoughts on "meneppian satire" on the Lucipo list and elsewhere a few months ago -a satire devoid of bile. It appears that this is not quite possible.

The End

The last crumbling remains of wooden architecture from the Golden Age of
rural life still hold literary & semantic clues for an organic poetry of th=

of flesh and bone.  And like these rural buildings & settlements, words can
be liberated to enable open networks of innovative language and thought.  I=

Hi Gabe,

I've been meaning to respond to this for a few days but just haven't had the time yet. But I really wanted to because I don't think you're quite
grasping the thrust of my point and are falling back on Buddhist platitudes that aren't quite germane to the discussion as a result. I can't quite
make up my mind if it's just that you don't understand me or if it's that you don't think it's worth your time to try to understand. I'm giving you
the benefit of the doubt for now, but i've pretty much talked my way out of that position by the end of this email and wind up feeling insulted again.
Anyhow, i think it's a conversation worth having so let me take this last email of yours point by point:

> I'm not sure that I was clear, or the passage about nonviolence was
> clear: nonviolence does not mean pacificism. An ethics of gentleness
> isn't an ethics of patsy-ism. Nonviolence means stopping violence. It
> does not mean succumbing to it. It's a common misunderstanding, but not
> even the Buddha was a pacifist. Sometimes hard action is necessary,
> whether hard verbal action or hard physical action.

I think you're really twisting in the wind to make this particular semantic distinction, and I don't see why it's necessary other than to be able to
call this particular brand of righteous violence a kind of nonviolence and therefore fit it under the Buddhist/Jainist principle of ahimsa. That
doesn't make any sense to me. I fail to see what hard verbal action or hard physical action are if they aren't a species of violence. And as such, a
position advocating non-violence cannot support such actions, no matter how one tries to twist the semantics of the discussion in the abstract. You
mentioned Gandhi at some point, and I've often thought that he's a perfect example of this sort of rhetorical posturing. Certainly in Gandhi's case it
had a purpose, given that it allowed him to take a morally superior position as viewed by the international community. As far as individuals go, I
don't see any pragmatic end for such positioning except personal aggrandizement, and therefore the posturing looks much more suspect to me in such cases.


>The buddha's only
> point was that one must tend one's own mind, to make it gentle, even
> when standing up to folks who are, well, thick.
And my point is, albeit slightly in a role of devil's advocate, that one is much better equipped to oppose violently (or vigorously as you put it)
dangerous opposition, if one embraces chaos and learns to live in it rather than striving for an unattainable ideal of peacefulness that generally
requires sitting around doing nothing for several hours everyday just to maintain. I often find i have no need to quiet my mind because rather than
taking that as an ideal, and one which, frankly, bores the hell out of me, i've learned to thrive in the chaotic psychic violence of postmodern urban
living. I exercise those muscles in my brain by listening to noisecore or microtonal electronic music, reading several books at a time so as to avoid
complete narrative absorption in any one story, staying up on world politics and trying to maintain relationships with the homeless schizophrenics and
crack addicts and prostitutes around where i live and work. this is the real world as far as I'm concerned and i feel like living in it fully and
learning how to live within it have prepared me and the people i know who live in a similar fashion to violently oppose injustice and at the same time
balance that opposition with having a full and active private life. I'm talking about cultivating a violent mind because one lives in violent
surroundings, since you're fond of eastern thought, as a taoist notion. being gentle and passive in an environment such as is found in modern cities
runs contrary to the natural state of the environment. It is in fact challenging the environment to try to beat you down. Instead, i think one should
let one's mind flow with whatever is happening and aspire to freedom. In a world such as this one, i fail to see how freedom of the mind can be
cultivated in any way other than in allowing it to reflect the chaos, turmoil, and violence of daily life. Perhaps were one to live a pastoral life
far away from the cities of north America and sequestered from news sources, then gentleness would be an option. But again i point out that such a
life is a life of luxury, and not available to everyone. As a luxury it is as suspect as are all things that are only available to those who live
through the exploitation of others necessary in unequal and unjust markets which are regulated to advantage of nation states rather than in order to
provide for the common good.

I don't understand what you're saying here, but it seems circular. People who don't have gentle minds are dangerous, and need to be gotten away from,
and i've realized this through my practice of making my mind gentle which has cause me to to see that such minds are dangerous.

Let me play devil's advocate based on my own experience and some of the conclusions one might draw from such experiences:
And yet the Buddha himself realized that the condition of life was suffering and then went about figuring out how to not succumb to that condition.
and i really disagree with you that Buddhism recognizes all of that variety because metaphysically at it's heart, Buddhism holds that all such
difference is illusory and the cause of our central suffering. The world is not a complex place, it only seems to be, and through following the noble
eightfold path to enlightenment one can be liberated from believing the world to be complex. Which is to say, at it's heart, if you DON'T accept the
Buddhist conception of maya, then the alleged benefits of Buddhist practice become very dubious, and the oft repeated claims that vipassana is a
secular practice dissolve into so much moksha. I say this having meditated regularly following "correct" practice for many years, so please don't come
back at me with a "try it, you'll see" sort of comment. vipassana at it's root, in my experience, is a systematic way of establishing several
pre-ordained metaphysical delusions through working in an altered state. objection: "meditation isn't going into a trance," heard it, don't buy it.
The cultivation of sati is the cultivation of an altered state of consciousness by definition, and no amount of metaphysical word wrangling is going
to get around that.

Now, I don't necessarily believe everything I just wrote. Like I said, i'm playing devil's advocate a bit. At the same time, I do think that the idea
of sati is a luxury that not everyone can afford, and much more interesting as a way of living in the modern world is the daoist principle of wuwei.
wuwei which is in direct conflict with the stated goals of vipassana meditation, but as a principle for behavior is philosophically rich, not
connected in the least to metaphysical arguments, and far more practically cultivated than is the sati at the center of vipassana. moreover, i'd argue
that wuwei, in the world we live in, requires a certain acquaintance and familiarity with violence at the very least, if not outright cultivation of a
  violent mind in order to exist in harmony with a violent world.

of course it was successful in calming prisoners (who opted in, in alabama and BC, I might add, which hardly gives a good sample) it was successful
because Marx was right "religion is the opiate of the masses." Opiates calm people down. I find it more than a little disturbing that India is being
held up as your example for the value of vipassana. India, the home of the Buddha, the land where these ideas were born and where they are pervasive
in the religious life of almost all citizens. India which of all modernizing countries has the most rigidly defined class system, where the dalits in
rural areas are regularly exploited by their political parties much in the way that Tammany hall exploited immigrants in the 19th century except on a
much larger scale. In India, even among the prostitutes in the red light district of Calcutta being a Brahman family brings with it privileges and
social benefits unavailable to lower caste families. I advise you to watch the documentary "Born into Brothels" and see what the high minded ideas of
personal enlightenment three thousand years of Indian Brahman philosophy have wrought for the children of prostitutes in Indian society.

See, now you're talking Greek and Hellenistic Philosophy and that means you're on my turf and in my mind what you've just said has really challenged
the verity of many of your other assertions on which my background is shakier. Epictetus was a fairly well-known philosopher in his day, it's true,
but to say he was the "most influential philosopher of his day" and that he was "more influential in his day than Plato." well, that's just lying.
Epictetus was a stoic, and while in certain circles, the stoics were very popular, consider for a moment who some of Epictetus's rough contemporaries
were. Seneca, Sextus Empiricus, Plotinus, Philo of Alexandria, Paul the Evangelist, etc. As far as influence goes Sextus Empiricus, Plotinus, and St.
Paul outstrip Epictetus by miles. And as far as being more influential in his day than Plato, well, that's just ludicrous. The three main schools of
Hellenism, epicurianism, stoicism, and scepticism, all claimed lineage from Socrates, who was only known through the descriptions of him by Plato and
Xenophon in their dialogs. Which is to say, Plato's influence was so pervasive (the academy and the lyceum were still open in Greece, remember, and
the Academy would remain so for another 500 years after Epictetus's death) that it's only not visible if you take too narrow a view.

To the point of comparing Stoicism as it was envisioned by one (freed) slave to your ethic of "gentleness," well, that's just ridiculous. Epictetus is
the classic example of the slave who says what his master's want to hear in order to curry favor. Moreover, the analogy to Buddhism of stoicism is
just lazy. Stoicism was an ethic of indifference and believed in the good of cultivating a detached apathy, not gentleness. You might as well be
drawing analogies between Buddhist non-violence and the Christian maxim to "turn the other cheek," which is one of the most heavily stoic influenced
doctrines of the early church. While that may be a good solution for a slave with no way out of a terrible situation, it's hardly the sort of thing
that a modern culturally engaged and privileged individual can justify. And similarly, it's a big part of the reason that Nietzche eventually came to
the conclusion that such ideologies are the ideologies of slaves and that freedom requires that such ethical systems be cast off and that new ethical
systems must be built. I think it's interesting that in the century following nietzche modern analytic philosophy, largely following Kant, has managed
to construct several such systems which I think allow for a greater participation in the lives and rights of humanity than anything you're going to
find in antiquity, whether it be the east or the west.

I think that's complete nonsense and is unsupported by the examples you've given. You've only got to look to all the wealthy people who loved
Epictetus in the Hellenic period to see how wrong this statement is. More to the point, I think I've more than made my case that in our era
cultivating one's mind requires embracing the violence of our environment, and if you respond, I'd like to see a response to that rather than just
further Buddhist derived dogma, which frankly i find a little insulting in that you don't i'm worthy of engaging on the merits of my arguments, but
rather am to be instructed as if from on high based on your superior wisdom. If that's your idea of "gentleness" then I think what you mean by
gentleness is "arrogance" and "close mindedness," or possibly "self-delusion that one has all the answers and doesn't need to pay attention to other
ideas."

My poetry book (the transparent dinner) is thisthisthis close to being finished, and I'm
supposed to round up five places to send it for reviews.  Anyone have any ideas?

Also, any suggestions for places to read in NYC?  I already have Ear Inn, I need a couple
more.

Moreover and furthermore, if anyone would like a postcard bearing the likeness of the
cover of my book, with a bit of a poem not found anywhere on the web (or in any book)
printed on the backside, please send your name and address to inktastesbitter@yahoo.com.

Thank you all so kindly.

I started the non-profit organization Combo Arts in part to be able to pay =
readers in the Downcity Poetry Series that Michael Gizzi and I host in Prov=
idence RI (www.downcitypoetry.org).  For what its worth, I think one reason=
 readers don't get paid (well) is because reading venues have shied away fr=
om a fundraising model, for a variety of reasons including a reluctance to =
get involved in the sullied world of asking everyone and anyone in the comm=
unity for money.  But, if you can get around that nervousness (ethically) t=
here is money to be found for your readers out there by tapping into the re=
venue streams (apologies for the corporate lingo) traditionally directed to=
ward the arts.  So, there's state and local arts councils etc, but also all=
 the sources that one would hit up if, say, one were raising money for a mu=
sic festival -- basically anybody who has money and an interest in having a=
 lively arts community in their neighborhood. So, you just need to set up a=
 501c3 which is a pain but not super difficult.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Hi, all!

  The Nonsense Company, an experimental theater and music trio out of Madison, WI,
  is performing in Chicago's Rhinoceros festival. Performances include:

  "The Climb Up Mount Chimborazo," a verse play by Rick Burkhardt.  A strange, poetic, and not-consistently-reverent meditation on the education of Simon Bolivar.  Bolivar's tutor, Simon Robinson, was an odd and never-reverent revolutionary whose approach to education seems radical even today.  In his spirit, the play veers wildly between historical periods:  Robinson's character is combined with other educators who fell foul of political currents (Jocelyn Elders puts in an appearance);  the (perhaps genetically modified) electric eels of Venezuela's Orinoco river foretell the future on a stock market program;  birds and bees of South America emerge from Bolivar's sombrero to conduct a right-wing talk show;  a bizarre lecture mixes military history with Zukofsky, Ginsberg, Whitman, and Kiplin; and the actors argue with themselves about why (and whether) they are playing heterosexual characters AGAIN.

The play is about the difficulty of knowing history, especially revolutionary history, especially a history that has been deliberately buried by its political opponents.  Much of the play (though not all of it) moves slowly and quietly.  The main characters have been dead for over 150 years.  If (like me) you have gaps in your knowledge about South American history, this play will fill some of them, point out others, and raise questions about how big a gap in history can get before the things that fall through are bigger than the things that remain.

Check out the play's webpage:

http://princemyshkins.com/chimborazopage.html

and come see it!  Sundays, 7pm, September 10 through October 22 (no performance October 1) at the Prop Thtr, 3504 N Elston, Chicago.  http://www.rhinofest.com

On September 15th at 7pm, two-thirds of the Company will perform as the political satire/cabaret duo The Prince Myshkins, whose incisive, hilarious songs have garnered praise from a variety of corners. Also performed: Rick Burkhardt's percussion trio "Great Hymn of Thanksgiving."  The Great Hymn takes place around a dinner table, where the sounds of conversation have been replaced by fragments of news reports from Iraq, scraps from the Army prayer manual, invented Arab folk tales, and a recurring State of Emergency pointing everywhere and leading nowhere. (Also, a bit of Rae Armantrout for the discriminating listener). The sounds of the table itself (singing wineglasses, squeaking forks, grinding peppermills) struggle to bring this “conversation” into a confrontation with material reality. Dinner theater it ain't.  For reservations, dial 773-539-7838.  (Then they'll disclose the location and give you directions.)

The Hymn's webpage:
http://princemyshkins.com/noncomgreathymn.html

We're ALSO (because two shows just isn't enough) performing the mysterious and haunting "The Jesus Fields" by our friend Matt Test (who played Constable Smith in our performance of the Threepenny Opera).  Agriculture, theology, and police interrogation movies all rolled into one.  This is also at the Prop Thtr (3504 N. Elston), Mondays at 7pm, September 11 to October 23, on a bill with "What Where," Samuel Beckett's frightening last play.

We look forward to seeing you at some of these shows!  Bring the masses!  (we are required to point out that these aren't "family" shows:  there's adult language and nudity.  Frankly, the kids would probably just find it dull.)

their awesome work and all those who have been readers.

After a summer hiatus, I am going for another posting push for

hi murat,

thanks for your email. i was away for the weekend. you ask me a few
public questions. i'll answer publicly to clarify -- but i've no
interest in defending myself or anything i've said. so to clarify:

again, my comments have not been about anyone in particular. those
sketches were not about, nor meant to be about, anyone in particular. i
gather there seems to be a theory that i'm commenting on someone in
particular. that's erroneous. i thought in yr email, which i got late
and read when tired, was that you were asking why i didn't use names,
not why i wasn't using the name of some particular person. i don't use
names because i don't know any one person who fits those sketches. they
are abstractions, rough sketches about aggregates of behavior. if you
can find one particular person who does all those things in teh five
sketches, wull okay, that's quite a person. (the one name of a living
person i did use, i used hastily -- and wrote a backchannel apology to
him immediately).

my point was and is that these are rough sketches of *social* games.
games that take a number of participants. it's not really a concern to
me if you believe that or not. but as you asked -- twice -- i want my
answer to be clear (because i'm assuming you're genuinely interested in
the answer -- and aren't looking for an excuse to play a game).

finally, not sure about your reference to lucipo: i really wasn't
following any of the discussions on lucipo in the past few months
closely at all, so can't comment on what you say about that. i'm not
sure what discussion about rap you're referencing. i was deleting
heavily. and i'm not really that interested to read the archives. i saw
at one point, because i was alerted to it by some backchannels from a
woman who had tried to comment on lucipo, that, in the midst of some
high traffic from one party, there was some attempt to comment by some
women, but that they were argued with, talked down to, and squelched. my
reference, in i think my last email, to lucipo and discussions on
structural approaches etc was not about recent lucipo traffic but about
discussions last year around a short essay i wrote.

hope this helps. that's all i'll say about this topic unless i am
queried directly by someone with a genuine interest in politely and
fruitfully discussing something bearing upon it.

warmly,
gabe

Hi Jason,

I'd like to discuss some of this with you, but I'm hesitant to do so. I
think some of the questions you raise are really interesting and
insightful, but it would help me if you could reframe your response in a
more polite way.

I'd really appreciate it if you could do that.

It would also help me (just because I won't have a lot of time this
week) if we could take your points a few at a time.

And it might help us both if I just state out front that I'll not
continue discussing anything if we move away from a polite exchange.

Is it okay with you if we proceed in this way?

Best to you, Jason.

Gabe

I'm looking for an event to accompany my students to in New York (or DC) sometime this fall.  We'll be coming from central Pennsylvania, from Penn State.

  In the past I've taken classes to the Nuyorican Friday night slams and, interesting and pleasurable as those are, this time out I'm hoping to find something that's a bit more demanding, something that complicates the categories of artist/ poet, dramatist/ actor and audience.  I'm trying to make everyone as nervous--and challenged--as possible.  (One of our texts this semester is Fiona Templeton's You the City.)

  We're four hours west of New York and it's interesting to me how many Penn State undergrads have never been.  Anyway I'd be grateful for performance suggestions.

  Thanks.

conference and events that will be in Brooklyn and Harlem Oct. 19-21

A question, especially for all you Adjunct Profs out there.  I've recently

The best health insurance in the world is eating whole and natural
foods, getting plenty of exercise & doing everything in your power to
lead a stress-reduced existence.

Don't breathe too much--even clean air wears out the parts. And even
clean things that float in the air can wreak havoc. Avoid all
machinery, also all animals. Hand tools can also be dangerous. Also
computers--think about arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome, and the
probable increase in the danger of cataracts. While exercising, try
not to stress any joints by using them--joints wear out. Avoid
walking under or near anything from which something could fall on
you. Avoid sex at all costs unless you first boil your and your
partner's genitals. Never kiss anything. If you're a woman don't get
pregnant. If you're a man try not to have a prostate.

As to stress, avoid work at all costs, especially with other human
beings (who also often carry diseases). Work that requires a
challenge to the self should also be avoided.

If you follow these rules, choose your ancestors very carefully and
eat soft organic foods nothing bad will ever happen to you, and you
won't need insurance.

hi, Gabe,

i apologize for being away from my mail and not responding to your post
earlier --

 "Nonviolence means stopping violence. It
does not mean succumbing to it. It's a common misunderstanding, but not
even the Buddha was a pacifist. Sometimes hard action is necessary,
whether hard verbal action or hard physical action. The buddha's only
point was that one must tend one's own mind, to make it gentle, even
when standing up to folks who are, well, thick. Ignorant people (and I
don't mean uneducated, I mean people who don't have control of their
minds) are dangerous."

** there is a great deal of interesting thinking here, and i'll try to piece
my way through some responses -- i think i see your point that not having
control of one's mind is dangerous, and i've rephrased your point
deliberately, for the simple reason that the human mind isn't always
controllable, and i question whether it should be, that unbridled thought in
the right context is a fantastic thing -- and i don't think it's only the
crazy people, whoever they are, that this applies to -- the human mind,
which is not scientifically understood on any grounds, i would say, and is
open to spirits of the divine, spirits of nature, spirits, in my case, of
marriage, is a site of reason but also a site of universal energy that
needn't i would say be entirely controlled -- because it is imposibble not
to have an unconscious -- that opening oneself to the unknown mind in the
mystical sense seems to be part of human possibility -- maybe not when
driving the freeway (unless you're driving a cab on the DanRyan) -- maybe
put more concisely i would say that the danger in the human mind is
something that can be made peace with, and i'm not just talking about
definitions of sanity, but of the elasticity inherent in thoughts -- this is
in response to your comment that Buddhism is about cultivating one's own
mind -- which is a much wiser statement than the thoughts jotted here, but i
would respond that the mind needs a wilderness, as well --

** your point that "nonviolence means stopping violence" is something i
would tend to disagree with, i mean even in the words, "stopping violence"
the sounds have a kind of slamming effect -- it is simply impossible to
force violence to stop -- but if violence is faced without a violent
response, with a nonviolent response, the idea would be to bring the
violence to an end, so maybe that is what you meant -- which is to say that
i don't think the US should have attacked Afghanistan, or Iraq, or anywhere
else for that matter -- my point of reference for this, which i'm working
out in an essay, is the writings of the desert fathers, who created a
non-acquisitive society of hermits, and in their period they became a locus
of shamanistic poetry for the neighboring urban centers -- this society of
hermits has interested me since i learned about them in 1997, which is
coincidentally about the time i met my husband, and it has been
conversations with him that have opened up some of the depths in those
writings, and those two threads are something i am working out in the essay
-- though of course the irony is that the essay tries to take an
accomplishment out of the works of those who denied themselves
accomplishment, that kind of spiritual poverty was critical to their work, a
spiritual poverty which is the very soul of love...  i'd just add that if
people waited until they were "good enough" as selves to do peace work, i
would never get in, but that doesn't matter, one doesn't have to wait until
you get that kind of seal of goodness, it's not about how "good" or "bad"
the self is, if you can find a context for working for peace -- the work
itself will change the self, make the self less, would be the hope -- that
the only way to the good is leaving the self behind because the self can't
get there anyway --

Or Viktor Frankl, who survived not just one extermination camp, but four
-- Theresienstadt, then Auschwitz, then Kaufering and Turkheim, the
latter two being adjuncts of Dachau -- and who said, "We who lived in
concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts
comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have
been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can
be taken from a person but one thing: the last of the human freedoms --
to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose
one's own way."

** you might be interested in the writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a
theologian and ethicist -- i am currently rereading his stuff and will post
about them when i have something to write on them

** sometime i would be very interested to hear about your work, Gabe,
teaching writing in prisons --

World Premiere of THE WISHING WELL, a play by Kevin Killian & Larry Rinder

Special benefit event – we suggest you arrive early – all seats $10 – first
come first served.

In present-day San Francisco, not everyone's  slacker, and artist-musician
Buddy Harrison resents the label more than most.  His art career seems like
it's taking off, for he's sold one of his lemonade-based stick figure drawings
for $150, and his acoustic band is polishing his Harry Smith-influenced
neo-folk number, "Mushroom Wind."  And yet one day Buddy wakes up and finds
out that his little web side project, the "Wishing Well" has made him rich
beyond his wildest imaginings, on a par with Craig from Craig's List.  That's
when his problems begin, as from around the globe, the people he helped and
the people he failed to help converge on the city on the bay for another fatal
round of summer wishes, winter dreams.  From Russia fly Natasha Berchofsky and
her French poodle, Bijou, cured of a pet disease once thought certain to kill
him.  From the Andes comes the young medical student and former shepherdess
Purissima, now a gene-splicing technician at the new UCSF Mission Bay genetic
labs.  Buddy's boyfriend, suave real estate broker Michael Morton, has his own
ideas about how to spend all that money.  But what does Buddy want-really
want?  Put a quarter in the wishing well of San Francisco Poets' Theater, and
find out.  Our thirty-fourth full-length production, written by Kevin Killian
and Larry Rinder, features an eclectic cast of poets, painters, musicians,
film and video artists, photographers, writers and curators, including Gerald
Corbin, Craig Goodman, Clifford Hengst, Scott Hewicker, Colter Jacobsen, Karla
Milosevich, Donal Mosher, Rex Ray, Laurie Reid, Leslie Shows, and Wayne Smith.

Hi Gabe,

I'm certainly capable of refraining from sarcasm if you're capable of avoiding the insulting tone of condescension of this email and the previous one that brought about my sarcastic remarks in the first place. Your tone has repercussions; you shouldn't be surprised that when you walk through life talking down to everyone who disagrees with you as if they were children who lacked your level of enlightenment, that some people will take umbrage at that. I certainly do.

If you wish to address me as an equal and take my arguments on their merits, I'll happily do the same and refrain from the sneering tone of my previous post. If you continue to feel the tone of your previous emails and this one are acceptable in open discourse, however, then I will not be kowtowing to your delusion that you are an enlightened guru dispensing wisdom from on high and there will be an end to the discussion.

yrs,
Jason

Dear All,

I hope you enjoy the new issue at http://listenlight.net.  I've retooled
the markup so that it's working almost perfectly in MSIE, which still
has over 50% share of the browser market.

This project, now ten weeks young, is my first go at web design, typing
out every character of the markup, hoping to make it accessible to the
hearing and visually impaired, and aiming to accommodate a future of
handheld devices optimized to xml schematics.

I want to invite submissions of work in audio and visual poetics for an
exclusive issue.  Please forward this message to your favorite audio |
visual poet.  Thank you.

All best,
Jesse Crockett

As someone who to his knowledge has never met any of the persons

could you please take it backchannel?  Those of us with a sociological
interest in such matters can follow the battle in the archives; those

Thanks for the poem Gabriel.  Looking at the vengeance driven faces of
Rumsfeld, Cheney, Bush et al - it remains tough to imagine how Gotama's
verse could ever begin to permeate the character structure of these folks.
George Bush lays a wreath at Ground Zero, while so many of us - concurrently
- want to immediately lay a wreath on his entire Presidency.

Last night - in my classics group - we watched Lars von Trier's  terrific,
painterly, very (albeit Nordic and haunting) beautifully done Medea (1987,
Danish Television). Instead of an inflamed death, we witness Medea - in her
over-the-top embrace by vengeance -  hang both of her young children. The
youngest resists, the older one is complicit.

Five years after the Twin Towers - and thankfully now with some resistance
from the Supreme Court and Congress folks, and public opinion - it is hard
not to look back and see where the Presidency's head long rush to vengeance
has devoured the constitutional vitals (balance, moderation) of this
country, not to let alone the destruction of Iraq and Lebanon. To resist or
be complicit remains the nagging moral question of the day.

This is no way to excuse vengeance bent jihadists that this country's
vengeance seems to so well aid and abet.

Hilarious!  One of the first poems I committed to memory was by my mother. It went something like this:

  Birdy birdy

The best introduction to Tinfish might not be Tinfish proper, but the
newest issue of How2.

I hope you've seen How2's special Pacific Poetries issues, the Tinfish
interview by Jane Sprague, and the many other features in the Spring and
Summer 2006 issue.  If you haven't, please look now:

http://www.asu.edu/pipercwcenter/how2journal/current/index.htm

Also, please take a look at Tinfish's website: http://tinfishpress.com

We have several forthcoming chaps and a book.  Soonest are chaps from
Jacinta Galeia`i and Jozuf Hadley (bradajo).  Later are chaps by Sarith
Peou, a Khmer Rouge survivor and prisoner; Leonard Schwartz, on
Israel/Palestine and a poetics of publishing; Kaia Sand, on secret
Oregon histories; Pam Brown and Maged Zaher, in collaboration.  Then
Hazel Smith's book and cd-rom.  So we're busy.

If you live in or near the Pacific, please feel free to send work to us
for consideration.  If you live anywhere at all, do read (and purchase!)
our books and our journal.

aloha, Susan

editors so that the workload is spread thin. There's also no remuneration.

Please check out the site, register (free), and contact one of the editors
if you're interested. Editors must be published poets and meet the approval
of the other editors. All styles of poetry are welcome at the site.

CALL FOR PAPERS

SHARP 2007 Conference: Open the Book, Open the Mind

The fifteenth annual conference of the Society for the History of
Authorship, Reading, and Publishing (SHARP) will be held in Minneapolis
at the University of Minnesota on July 11-15, 2007. SHARP is the leading
international association for historians of print culture, enlisting
more than 1,200 scholars world-wide; its members study "the creation,
dissemination, and reception of script and print, including newspapers,
periodicals, and ephemera," as well as the history of books. The
forthcoming conference is organized in cooperation with the College of
Liberal Arts, University of Minnesota; University of Minnesota
Libraries; Minneapolis Public Library; Minnesota Historical Society, and
Minnesota Center for Book Arts -- a part of Open Book.

The conference theme, "Open the Book, Open the Mind," will highlight how
books develop and extend minds and cultures, and also how they are
opened to new media and new purposes. However, individual papers or
sessions may address any aspect of book history and print or manuscript
culture.

The conference organizers invite proposals for individual presentations,
and also for complete panels of three presentations on a unifying topic.
As is the SHARP custom, each session of 90 minutes will feature three
papers of up to 20 minutes, providing time for substantive discussion
with members of the audience. Proposals should be submitted via the
online conference website by November 30, 2006: please go to
http://purl.oclc.org/NET/SHARP2007proposals and follow the directions
provided there.

Each individual proposal should contain a title, an abstract of no more
than 300 words, and brief biographical information about the author or
co-authors. Session proposals should explain the theme and goals, as
well as include the three individual abstracts.

Each year SHARP provides funding support for a few partial travel grants
for advanced graduate students and for independent scholars. If you
would like to apply for such support please do so online, as you submit
your proposal.

In keeping with the theme of the conference, a "pre-conference" of
practical workshops and a plenary session devoted to book arts and
artists' books will be held at the Minnesota Center for Book Arts at
Open Book, near the University of Minnesota campus, on Tuesday, July 10,
2007. Details about that pre-conference and about the main conference
program, registration, and housing arrangements will be made available
early in 2007 at the general conference web site,
http://www.cce.umn.edu/conferences/sharp. Much information about SHARP
2007 and its location, including hotel-reservation information, is
already available there.

Funny and better than my advice. Cref looks like it's only got life insurance, not health. Sorry, better stick to pre-chewed organic foods and lots of deep breathing.

Hi, Heidi,

It's always nice to see your posts. I'd be interested in yr thoughts on
Bonhoeffer. As well the desert fathers, esp. as regards their poetry. I
had heard of B., yeah, but know little about him, his ideas, or his
practice. Not googled him yet but I think I recall he was murdered by
Nazis.

I think you're right to question what I wrote here: "Nonviolence means
stopping violence." Your point makes total sense to me, and I agree that
what I wrote wasn't accurate. The verb "stopping" implies force, and
force implies violence. The _Dhammapada_ says this just after it opens:
"Hate is not overcome by hate. It's only appeased by lovingkindness
(Metta). This is an eternal law." It then says, "Some don't know that in
quarreling we essentially die, but those who do realize this calm
themselves." (aphorisms 5-6)

You write (elegantly), "the human mind isn't always controllable, and i
question whether it should be, that unbridled thought in the right
context is a fantastic thing -- and i don't think it's only the crazy
people, whoever they are, that this applies to -- the human mind,which
is not scientifically understood on any grounds"

The Buddha taught control (calming) and purification of the mind -- and
I'll explain what he meant by that (as best I'm able). "Control,"
"purify": I found anger arising in my own mind when I first heard
someone use the words "control" and "purification" -- about MY mind?!,
no thank you! -- sounded suspicious and nazi-like: is it possible, let
alone desirable, to purify the mind? I had an idea that purification was
synonymous with sterilization.

I'm obviously someone taken with what Siddhatta Gotama taught and
practiced. But I am this way not because I'm adhering to some belief
structure, or because I've got faith in "the Buddha." I don't. Gotama
was a secularist and an empiricist and he urged that no one have faith
in him personally as a savior nor in his teaching as an intellectual
harbor; he urged instead that what he said and practiced be approached
skeptically and that what he was teaching be tested against one's own
experience. I think it's fair to say he was a pragmatist and an
experiential scientist (in my estimation) whose principle gift was as an
example and an inspiration. This thing he taught, as you probably know
was called a noble 8 fold path, ariya atthangika magga, which is divided
into 3 sections: morality, control over the mind (calming the mind), and
experiential insight (not intellectual insight). The latter two are
accomplished through samadhi (concentrative meditation) and vipassana
(insight meditation).

So when I was talking about controlling the mind, I meant first: living
morally (not stealing, not taking intoxicants of any kind, not engaging
in sexual misconduct, not lying, and not killing). The reason being that
it's a universal law that anytime one does the opposite (lie, kill,
steal, have a glass of wine, etc), the mind becomes agitated, which
prohibits one from being able to calm it (2nd step) enough to purify it
(3rd step). The second thing I meant: taming the mind's habits of
reaction through first being able to (a) concentrate it, then (b) use it
to purify one's "sankharas" or reactive habit patterns. The ultimate
goal is to rid oneself of reactive habit patterns.

So when there is talk of controlling hte mind, what's meant is simply
calming it enough to go toward the third stage: coming out of reactive
habit patterns. By controlling it, I don't mean restricting it. I
literally mean establishing the groundwork necessary to liberate it:
setting it free as a responsive agent, a responsive "site of universal
energy" (yr apt words). I know that the word "control" is loaded, so
maybe calming is a better word (the Pali word "samadhi," etymologically
is closer to calming anyway).

A mind free from reactive habits has several powerful qualities, one of
which is extreme malleability and creativity (not there yet!). Other
qualities such a mind has: compassion, sympathetic joy, lovingkindness,
equanimity (these are often considered the four most wholesome states
that a mind can achieve); as well as what are often called the ten
perfections of mind: patience, tolerance, renunciation [the ability to
renounce], generosity, energy, truthfulness, lovingkindness, equanimity,
morality, and determination. You'll notice that two of the ten
perfections are also in the four really wholesome states.  I've seen the
arrival, in small ways, of some of these qualities in my own life, but
where I get the most inspiration is from meditators I spend time with
who have taken 30 and 45 day courses and can walk this walk more
effectively than I can -- so primarily my own experience, and
secondarily the experience of those I know and trust, tells me that this
works.

So, the people I sit with, meditate with, are not enamored w/ this
ariyaatthangikamagga b/c they're all uptight and trying to control
themselves or because they've got an idea or a belief that doing so will
save them at some point down the road: they do so because practicing it
is already working. It's a gradual deal, but its effects are immediate.
They are very fun loving people, kind, witty, alive, goofy, and hard
working -- from all walks of life. I laugh more with them than I do with
any other group. I see it working in my own life too, but I also see it
workign strongly in the lives these friends with whom I spend a lot of
time up at the Illinois Vipassana Meditation Center (where I was over
the weekend, and where I often am during the summers and on breaks from
teaching). There are 7 such centers in the US and three in Canada.
Typically, and it's true for me, the practitioners, once they become
established in these practices by taking a ten day course, begin to
observe real and (for me) quite remarkable effects in the mind, the
life, personality, sense of well being, memory, clarity of mind, and the
emotional life. These only deepen with further practice. These friends,
these fellow meditators, are the whole of this life for me: I would not
do this if i didn't have great friends doing it too. So "controlling the
mind" for me is not about sterilizing it by any means, or becoming in
isolative creature devoid of any mental curlicues or emotions; quite the
opposite. The purpose is, as near as I can understand it, to awaken an
entirely NEW set of emotions and sense of affiliations.

Finally, I like what you say that I thought this particularly useful and
well put: "i'd just add that if people waited until they were "good
enough" as selves to do peace work, i would never get in, but that
doesn't matter, one doesn't have to wait until you get that kind of seal
of goodness, it's not about how "good" or "bad" the self is, if you can
find a context for working for peace -- the work itself will change the
self, make the self less, would be the hope -- that the only way to the
good is leaving the self behind because the self can't get there anyway --"

That makes perfect sense to me.

Thanks for your responsiveness, Heidi.

hi there.

back in the spring, i was commissioned to interview a poet who'd recently published a new book. through the process of researching his work and interviewing him, i became a fan of his writing and of him as well. the interview piece turned out well, and i was proud of it; also glad to help this guy get some notice in the press.

well--long story short, the magazine that assigned me the piece has changed the direction of the theme issue this piece was assigned for. so, the piece no longer fits with what they're doing. they're going to pay me a kill fee.

rights to the piece, of course, are back with me, and i'd really like to find a home for it. the poet's work has strong environmentalist/ naturalist components. he's established, gifted, warm, and a great interviewee. i'm not going to mention his name at this point--because i haven't had the heart to tell him yet that the assignment has fallen through. i'd much rather contact him to say, "the piece won't be in x--but it will be in y, instead!" and i'm asking you all for suggestions about what "y" could be. (i have some ideas of my own, but i figure i might as well cast a wide net.) the interview touches on the poet's work, current environmental issues, societal approaches to the environment, and the intersection of these three things.

i wouldn't turn down money--the kill fee i'm getting in no way reflects the time i put into this piece--but publication in the right venue is more important to me than a price tag.

thanks for advice, via list or backchannel. best, pam

Oriole Legend and 1970 AL MVP  JOHN "BOOG" POWELL (and
Brooks' good buddy) is selling his 2004 GMC Yukon. It
is being offered on  Ebay. The winning bidder will not
only receive a fantastic vehicle, they will also take
part in an evening to remember. The winning bidder and
a friend will be invited to have dinner with Boog at
Morton's Steakhouse and then take in a game at Camden
Yards.

Take a look. You can click on the link below or simply
go to Ebay and look for auction #300024745298

Speaking of Brooks, he will be appearing this Saturday
at The Maryland Science Center in conjunction with the
Norman Rockwell Exhibit. He will only be signing
Rockwell prints purchased at the museum.

Brooks' next web signing will take place on November
18th. We will begin accepting mail-in items beginning
October 1st. Stay tuned to the website for more
details.

cross posting alert - as i have already gone on record about on a another list - i i'll do it again - just so there is no mistaking my feelings


  i think Sina Queyras is really fucked up on meth if she think this is canadian strange - it's more like canadian syrup - even the Liz Bachinsky's is very tame stuff for her - sure it runs circles around Robby Mc but it is all kinda sweet and pretty like a Eskimo seal carving in a Niagara Falls gift shop

(Sina when to canada and all we got is crappy boring tame poems)

really not even a good try

Ah, yes, Pierre:

That beaver doth drive sooo much:
appearing on that rug and the coat-of-
arms of the state flag as well!
Perhaps somehow the beaver maketh
of us a theocracy after all, n'est pas?

Thankyou, Gabriel, for posting all this dhamma information.  I've heard it many times before in the more than thirty years I've been involved with vipassana but it's always good to see and hear it again.  To say that "progress" on the Path is "gradual" seems almost like an understatement sometimes.  But there is change (anicca), fortunately as well as sometimes, not.  Regards, Tom Savage

Gabriel Gudding <gmguddi@ILSTU.EDU> wrote:  Hi, Heidi,

It's always nice to see your posts. I'd be interested in yr thoughts on
Bonhoeffer. As well the desert fathers, esp. as regards their poetry. I
had heard of B., yeah, but know little about him, his ideas, or his
practice. Not googled him yet but I think I recall he was murdered by
Nazis.

I think you're right to question what I wrote here: "Nonviolence means
stopping violence." Your point makes total sense to me, and I agree that
what I wrote wasn't accurate. The verb "stopping" implies force, and
force implies violence. The _Dhammapada_ says this just after it opens:
"Hate is not overcome by hate. It's only appeased by lovingkindness
(Metta). This is an eternal law." It then says, "Some don't know that in
quarreling we essentially die, but those who do realize this calm
themselves." (aphorisms 5-6)

You write (elegantly), "the human mind isn't always controllable, and i
question whether it should be, that unbridled thought in the right
context is a fantastic thing -- and i don't think it's only the crazy
people, whoever they are, that this applies to -- the human mind,which
is not scientifically understood on any grounds"

The Buddha taught control (calming) and purification of the mind -- and
I'll explain what he meant by that (as best I'm able). "Control,"
"purify": I found anger arising in my own mind when I first heard
someone use the words "control" and "purification" -- about MY mind?!,
no thank you! -- sounded suspicious and nazi-like: is it possible, let
alone desirable, to purify the mind? I had an idea that purification was
synonymous with sterilization.

I'm obviously someone taken with what Siddhatta Gotama taught and
practiced. But I am this way not because I'm adhering to some belief
structure, or because I've got faith in "the Buddha." I don't. Gotama
was a secularist and an empiricist and he urged that no one have faith
in him personally as a savior nor in his teaching as an intellectual
harbor; he urged instead that what he said and practiced be approached
skeptically and that what he was teaching be tested against one's own
experience. I think it's fair to say he was a pragmatist and an
experiential scientist (in my estimation) whose principle gift was as an
example and an inspiration. This thing he taught, as you probably know
was called a noble 8 fold path, ariya atthangika magga, which is divided
into 3 sections: morality, control over the mind (calming the mind), and
experiential insight (not intellectual insight). The latter two are
accomplished through samadhi (concentrative meditation) and vipassana
(insight meditation).

So when I was talking about controlling the mind, I meant first: living
morally (not stealing, not taking intoxicants of any kind, not engaging
in sexual misconduct, not lying, and not killing). The reason being that
it's a universal law that anytime one does the opposite (lie, kill,
steal, have a glass of wine, etc), the mind becomes agitated, which
prohibits one from being able to calm it (2nd step) enough to purify it
(3rd step). The second thing I meant: taming the mind's habits of
reaction through first being able to (a) concentrate it, then (b) use it
to purify one's "sankharas" or reactive habit patterns. The ultimate
goal is to rid oneself of reactive habit patterns.

So when there is talk of controlling hte mind, what's meant is simply
calming it enough to go toward the third stage: coming out of reactive
habit patterns. By controlling it, I don't mean restricting it. I
literally mean establishing the groundwork necessary to liberate it:
setting it free as a responsive agent, a responsive "site of universal
energy" (yr apt words). I know that the word "control" is loaded, so
maybe calming is a better word (the Pali word "samadhi," etymologically
is closer to calming anyway).

A mind free from reactive habits has several powerful qualities, one of
which is extreme malleability and creativity (not there yet!). Other
qualities such a mind has: compassion, sympathetic joy, lovingkindness,
equanimity (these are often considered the four most wholesome states
that a mind can achieve); as well as what are often called the ten
perfections of mind: patience, tolerance, renunciation [the ability to
renounce], generosity, energy, truthfulness, lovingkindness, equanimity,
morality, and determination. You'll notice that two of the ten
perfections are also in the four really wholesome states. I've seen the
arrival, in small ways, of some of these qualities in my own life, but
where I get the most inspiration is from meditators I spend time with
who have taken 30 and 45 day courses and can walk this walk more
effectively than I can -- so primarily my own experience, and
secondarily the experience of those I know and trust, tells me that this
works.

So, the people I sit with, meditate with, are not enamored w/ this
ariyaatthangikamagga b/c they're all uptight and trying to control
themselves or because they've got an idea or a belief that doing so will
save them at some point down the road: they do so because practicing it
is already working. It's a gradual deal, but its effects are immediate.
They are very fun loving people, kind, witty, alive, goofy, and hard
working -- from all walks of life. I laugh more with them than I do with
any other group. I see it working in my own life too, but I also see it
workign strongly in the lives these friends with whom I spend a lot of
time up at the Illinois Vipassana Meditation Center (where I was over
the weekend, and where I often am during the summers and on breaks from
teaching). There are 7 such centers in the US and three in Canada.
Typically, and it's true for me, the practitioners, once they become
established in these practices by taking a ten day course, begin to
observe real and (for me) quite remarkable effects in the mind, the
life, personality, sense of well being, memory, clarity of mind, and the
emotional life. These only deepen with further practice. These friends,
these fellow meditators, are the whole of this life for me: I would not
do this if i didn't have great friends doing it too. So "controlling the
mind" for me is not about sterilizing it by any means, or becoming in
isolative creature devoid of any mental curlicues or emotions; quite the
opposite. The purpose is, as near as I can understand it, to awaken an
entirely NEW set of emotions and sense of affiliations.

Finally, I like what you say that I thought this particularly useful and
well put: "i'd just add that if people waited until they were "good
enough" as selves to do peace work, i would never get in, but that
doesn't matter, one doesn't have to wait until you get that kind of seal
of goodness, it's not about how "good" or "bad" the self is, if you can
find a context for working for peace -- the work itself will change the
self, make the self less, would be the hope -- that the only way to the
good is leaving the self behind because the self can't get there anyway --"

That makes perfect sense to me.

Thanks for your responsiveness, Heidi.

Gabe

I actually quite like his work.  Exactly what is it about his work that so
offends you?  I'm not sure WHY I like his work so well, and am interested in
knowing why you dislike it so intensely.  I suspect your aversion to it may
say more about you than it does about the work, as is the case with nearly
all critical spews.

At any rate I think it would be informative to have your opinion backed up
with something a little more substantial than "junk."

If you notice, in my original post, I said, "I'm not sure WHY I like his
work."  What part of that didn't you understand?

I think it has something to do with the chaotic nature of it with an
underlying structure that holds a promise of emerging order.  I like the
color and tone and texture of his work too.  Why it strikes a strong chord
with me, I'm not certain.  Then, again, I think there's much too much
emphasis put on certainty.  Perhaps that attitude has a little to do with it
as well.  The reason I posted in the first place was to get more of an
expostion against which to contrast my own opinions so as to better
understand my affinity for the work, Kevin's aversion to it, and perhaps
even the work itself.

Anyway, Kevin replied to me backchannel and I'm including his message,
perhaps to further this discussion.  To wit:

<forwarded message>
i think i'm out of posts for the day. and my follow up apology was based
exactly on what you rightfully pointed out. (perhaps you can forward this to
the list?)

my qualm is this: the work is like an aselm adams photograph meets chain
restaurant environmental graphics. in terms of his ability to use software,
it is sound. but in terms of being either surprised by, or impressed by, the
idea behind it, i think it does neither. what would the compulsion be to
make this?

"I suspect your aversion to it may
say more about you than it does about the work"

i think that is the case with any opinion--it has to be spewed by someone,
and based on their experience, no?

Stepping out of lurk for a moment. I realize it's all a matter of
taste, but I actually love these pieces. It could be that my exposure
to stuff like this has been limited; however here's what I like about them:

At first glance, the image is quite beautiful: the colours are fall
colours, which for me represent melancholy and a joy for life all at
the same time.
When you take a deeper look, I see horror; a cut off hand, scorched
detritus, blood.
They seem fitting for the times and evoked sadness and awe in me. I
didn't just pass them by.
I like the ghostliness of the words too. I can't quite make them out,
except for "torture," which piques my curiosity
I also am curious about how the artist actually did this. Was each
piece created just thru something like Photoshop or was there
something handmade about the process, such as putting together a collage first.

I think the artist could have done this in a much more cliche way. I
probably would have, but he steps out of the cliche box for me with
the way the piece is configured and disguising the words.

It piqued my curiosity and evoked an emotion. I can't really ask for
much more than that. But, I'd be interested in seeing what you like,
Daniel and hearing why you like it.

Delighted to announce the publication of

WORD IS BORN

"thanks to the love / I reft with war" (MK)
Vs
"non-Combat is blasphemy" (RP)

WORD IS BORN from Arehouse Press: a collection from REITHA PATTISON =20
(her first) and MICHAEL KINDELLAN (Charles Baudelaire, Bad Press =20
2005) containing duelling translations of eight lyric poems by the =20
13th century troubadour poet, heterosexual and murderer Bertrand de =20
Born, who co-owned a castle, and died in 1215.

He says about her: "Frank O'Hara in tights". She says about him: =20
"Bucaneer/faux romantik, one more low-grade, low-slung, shiny-=20
epauleted noxious Casanova with a curious pecadillo: a top-hole =20
miasma of a philology". They're not wrong. Buy now & see who wins.

Reitha Pattison lives in Cambridge with her partner and baby son. She =20=

manages the translations list of a local academic publishing
house. Word is Born is her first collection of poetry.

Michael Kindellan is born in Toronto, and lives in London where he is =20=

working as a literary agent.  Also works for Corriere della Sera and =20
the Cabinet Office.  He's published Baudelaire translations through =20
Bad Press, some of which are same again in Quid, and translated =20
Rimbaud's Le Bateau Ivre in Chicago Review, whereat he's contributing =20=

editorially.

Cheques payable to "Arehouse" in the quantity of =A33.50 (inc p&p) =20
gladly received to 72 Sedgwick Street, Cambridge, CB1 3AL. Those =20
overseas can pay by PayPal and should email Ladkin(at)gmail.com to =20
get further instructions.

Chris Goode, he says: "... an absolutely gorgeously made book, nicely =20=

set and elegantly weighted. And the concept, maan, is a serious hoot. =20=

Eight poems by notorious troubadorial schism-sower Bertran[d] de Born =20=

(I go with the authors in favouring 'Bertrand', I think; 'Bertran' =20
sounds too much like a blue-collar programming language), translated =20
independently by Pattison and Kindellan, and the two utterly =20
divergent versions printed cheek-by-jowl, Pattison on the left-hand =20
page of each spread and Kindellan on the right. There are huge =20
swathes where it's impossible to imagine the two translations sharing =20=

a source text at all: and wherever there are more openly apparent =20
momentary connexions, they only serve to recharge, rather than =20
dispel, the tensions between the two sets ... It's a terrific =20
project, full of movement and robust -- promiscuous, I almost said -- =20=

Dear Professor Nielsen,

I hope this message finds you well.

I write to ask your help in our search for a colleague in African
Diaspora/African American literatures. As you know, competition for
excellent scholars in the field is intense. Many of us believe that a
great way to attract the best is to consult established scholars who
know of dynamic colleagues who would contribute much to our program.

I ask, then, that you mention or forward our job advertisement below
(it's now in the _Chronicle of Higher Education_ and the MLA Job
Information List) to anyone you know who might be interested. I'd be
happy to answer any questions you might have.

I hope to see you at CLA and MLA again soon.

Best wishes,

Darryl Dickson-Carr

We seek a tenure-track assistant professor in African Diaspora
literatures of any period and/or African American literature before the
twentieth century. In August 2007 the greatly augmented SMU English
Department (with 3 new endowed chairs) will admit its first class of six
students to its new Ph.D. program; this small, select, exceptionally
well-funded doctoral program will build on the department's newly
revised undergraduate curriculum and existing M.A. degree, with their
recognized strengths in literary studies and creative writing.
Candidates for this position should therefore have a demonstrated
commitment to teaching and excellent potential as a publishing scholar.
The Ph.D. from a literature department or appropriate area studies
program must be completed no later than August 15, 2007. For full
consideration, applicants must send a CV and a letter outlining teaching
and research interests to Ezra Greenspan, Chair of the English
Department, postmarked no later than October 20, 2006, although the
recruitment committee will continue to accept applications until the
position is filled. Send no writing samples at this time. We will be
interviewing at MLA and will notify applicants of our decisions after
the position is filled. SMU will not discriminate on the basis of race,
color, religion, national origin, sex, age, disability, or veteran
status. SMU's commitment to equal opportunity includes nondiscrimination
on the basis of sexual orientation. We invite applications from women
and minorities.

Macedonia

Poet Radovan Pavlovski tailed by communist secret police

Skopje, 13.09.2006 12:57

Academician Radovan Pavlovski, one of the greatest Macedonian
contemporary poets, had been under surveillance of the communist
secret police, as "enemy of the state", and he was placed in a
category of those perpetrating "hostile propaganda".

This information was published in Macedonian literature magazine
Sintezi. In the latest issue, the Sintezi magazine quotes extracts
from police file on poet Pavlovski for the period 1958-1966.

According to paperwork, Pavlovski was tailed throughout the fruitful
poem writing period, including the time when he was on military
service in the Former Yugoslav Army (JNA).

Pavlovski is one of the most famous Macedonian poets and prominent
personality in Macedonian literature. He won a number of literature
prizes and recognitions.

His poetry was translated in some 30 languages. His poems are present
in a number of anthologies of world poetry.

In 2006, Pavlovski became a member of the Macedonian Academy of
Sciences & Arts (MANU). /end/

You may ask, "why don't I start a poetry journal on the web, people love
them!"  Then you look at pricing plans & decide to live within your
means, tho it is yet a good idea...

I, humble editor of listenlight.net, receive a statement each month from
my hosting service the next-to-nil space & bandwidth usage.  I'm secure
until mid June, at which time I will most likely renew the plan, but in
the meantime, talk to me about your idea for a journal, or somewhat
related, or radically different, web publication.  You register the
domain through the existing plan, and I will set up full ftp and/or
shell access to your domain, and plenty of space to work with, at no
other charge until June, when I'll ask a modest gratuity, consider
bartering for cool books & chaps, or boot you off.

All best,

===========================================

Oliver Kamm/5BE Gallery is pleased to announce STREET POETS & VISIONARIES: SELECTIONS
FROM THE UBUWEB COLLECTION, an exhibition of posters and ephemeral writings from the
streets of New York City.

In the tradition of Jim Shaw's "Thrift Shop Paintings," this collection of street
posters, mad scribblings, political screeds, religious rants, and paranoid raves expands
our notion of the Outsider arts to include the written word.

Formally striking, emotionally charged, and bizarre beyond belief, these graphical works
dovetail with the historic traditions of concrete poetry and art brut. Seamlessly melding
text and image, their obsessive quality evokes Adolf Wölfli and Henry Darger's visionary
works.

Featured in the exhibition will be the work of David Daniels, a 73 year-old Bay Area
artist, who has been creating insanely complex visual poems using only Microsoft Word.
Works from two of his epic series, "The Gates of Paradise" and "Years" will be featured.

Coinciding with the exhibition will be three public events. On Saturday, September 23rd
at 2 p.m., author Irwin Chusid will deliver a lecture on Outsider Music called, "Songs in
the Key of Z." On Saturday, September 30th, renowned poets and performers Eileen Myles,
Edwin Torres, Vijay Seshadri, Kenneth Goldsmith and Shelley Hirsch will stage a reading
of Outsider writings. On Saturday, October 7th, a panel, "Outside In" will explore the
transmigration of Outsider aesthetics and practices influencing and entering into the
mainstream. Panelists include Wayne Koestenbaum, Alissa Quart and David Grubbs. All
events are free and open to the public.

UbuWeb (ubu.com) is the Internet's largest resource dedicated to all strains of the
avant-garde, ethnopoetics, and outsider arts, featuring thousands of MP3s, films, books,
scholarly papers, and poems.

Oliver Kamm/5BE Gallery is located at 621 West 27th Street, on the ground floor. Gallery
hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 11-6.

For further information or images, please contact the gallery at 212-255-0979 or visit

*"Around us, everything is writing; that's what we must perceive. Everythin=
g
is writing. It's the unknown in oneself, one's head, one's body. Writing is
not even a reflection, but a kind of faculty one has, that exists to one
side of oneself, parallel to oneself: another person who appears and comes
forward, invisible, gifted with thought and anger, and who sometimes,
through her own actions, risks losing her life. Into the night."* --
Marguerite Duras

We are pleased to announce a new book by Alice Notley, Grave of Light:
New and Selected Poems, 1970-2005.

Considered by many to be among the most outstanding of living American
poets, Alice Notley has amassed a body of work that includes intimate
lyrics, experimental diaries, traditional genres, the postmodern
series, the newly invented epic, political observation and invective,
and the poem as novel. This chronological selection of her most
notable work offers a delineation of her life and creative
development. Formerly associated with the second generation of the New
York School, Notley has become a poet with a completely distinctive
voice. Grave of Light is a progression of changing forms and styles-an
extensive panorama held together explicitly by the shape of the poet's
times. Notley's poems challenge their subjects head-on, suffusing
language with radiant truth.

Call for a poetry of pure touch with text-like elements. This poetry
could be sculptural&#8211;free standing or relief work&#8211;or be flat
$B!H(Bpage$B!I(B poetry, but the tactile elements should take precedence over
the visual&#8211;i.e., this is poetry that does not need to be seen to
be experienced. I can imagine that the temperature of the work could
become an important element, as well as the dryness or wetness of the
surfaces.

I can also imagine $B!H(Bpure$B!I(B tactile poetry practicioners that do not
allow the poem to be seen at all and $B!H(Bsoft$B!I(B practicioners of the art
who allow their creations to be seen as well as touched.

Of course, this is not visual poetry, but the elements of visual poetry
(in all its liminal glory) translated to another sense.

Perhaps there are already haptic poetry groups in operation? If so,

hi all on POETICS; please excuse cross-postings, thanks.

Greetings All,

If you are receiving this call, you have either had work in WORD Issue 1:
Schizotype, submitted to WORD in the past, crossed email addresses with the
WORD list, or produced work which may fit into this upcoming issue. Issue 1
was a successful survey of contemporary/experimental poetry, and can be
viewed here:

http://peekreview.net/word/index_word_frameset.html

Issue 2 will be based around the impossibility of the phrase taken from a
show on the Discovery Channel, "Chimera: I Am My Own Twin." Please consider
submitting "texts" (of any sort, including short essays and visuals) which
address this idea, either intentionally or fortuitously. Although the
content of the text may overtly deal with the theme, you are equally welcom=
e
to submit works which do so through presentation.

Possible beginnings: twins, impossibility/plausibility of the double,
doppelganger, nested/parasitic texts, translation of one text into another,
performance and its translation by documentation, similarity, concurrence,
coincidence, ghosts, coincidence, concurrence, similarity, documentation an=
d
its translation by performance, translation of the other text into its
original form, parasitic/nested texts, doppelganger,
plausibility/impossibility of the double, twins...

You may submit to lauren@peekreview.net, or to lauren.bender@gmail.com.
Please feel free to post widely. We welcome questions and comments, and
thank you in advance for your participation.

Lauren Bender

updated on the soon-to-be totally revamped website. Please scroll down for
the workshop descriptions and the first week=B9s readings.
The latest newsletter is fresh from the press and en route to you now.

WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT
=20
EXPERIMENTAL WRITING WORKSHOP =AD LARRY FAGIN
TUESDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 10TH
=20
=B3Why do we see certain kinds of writing as "experimental?"  What makes this
writing different than conventional writing?  This workshop is open to
writers of poetry and prose, who are willing to examine traditional methods
and styles, and to question the assumptions that make up the concept of
"self-expression."  In what ways do a line, a stanza, a sentence, or a
paragraph perform strangeness or surprise?  What is the crucial difference
between earnestness and sincerity?  We will use two key ideas as tools of
inquiry.  One is sprezzatura, a 14th century Italian term that translates
loosely as "making something look effortless."  The other is
Fingerspitzengefuehl, variously translated as "sensitive touch" or
"intuition." Every writer has habitual strategies, which they tend to
repeat. How can one abandon, if only temporarily, these habits, and explore
other possibilities? What have you got to lose?  Authors referenced include
Whitman, Apollinaire, Cendrars, Stein, Khlebnikoff, Pessoa, Dos Passos, Jan=
e
Bowles, Pound, Williams, Moore, Riding, Olson, Creeley, Spicer, children=B9s
writing and found writing.=B2 Larry Fagin edits Adventures in Poetry books an=
d
Sal Mimeo magazine, teaches at The New School, and writes in the afternoon.
=20
=20
TRANSLATE THIS! =AD MARCELLA DURAND
THURSDAYS at 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 12TH
=20
=B3Translation is a highly charged and highly problematic way to apprehend th=
e
=B3foreign/other.=B2 We translate the emotional, physical and spoken worlds
about us, rendering them into our own realms of the (in)comprehensible.
We=B9ll discuss ethical, political, economic and practical issues of
translating various languages, both inter- and intranational. We=B9ll also
talk about translating natural and unnatural happenings, objects, patterns
and chaos. We=B9ll translate visual and aural experiences. Sometimes we=B9ll
leave things untranslated and utterly mysterious. Readings include Francis
Ponge, Nicole Brossard, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Tina Darragh, Paula Claire,
and others.=B2 Marcella Durand is the author of The Anatomy of Oil, Western
Capital Rhapsodies, City of Ports and Lapsus Linguae. She has translated
French writers, including Jean-Michel Espitallier and Mich=E8le M=E9tail, as
well as geological formations, corporate-speak, and construction sites into
pseudo-=B3American=B2 tongues.
=20
=20
SATIRE AS CULTURAL ENGAGEMENT =AD GARY SULLIVAN
FRIDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 13TH
=20
=B3Satire insists on a level of cultural engagement not always required by
other approaches to creative expression. We will read, listen to, and watch
satirical work from around the world and across millennia=8Bfrom ancient
Greece to contemporary Afghanistan and Zimbabwe, with many points in
between. Global examples will be our temporary touchstones as we hone our
own cultural engagement in our poetry. Participants don=B9t need to be funny,
just observant.=B2 Gary Sullivan is the author of How to Proceed in the Arts,
Swoon (with Nada Gordon), and two issues of the comic book series,
Elsewhere.
=20
APPLIED POETICS =AD KRISTIN PREVALLET
SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 14TH
=20
=B3Bringing together the curriculum programs of The Poetry Project and the
Bowery Poetry Club, this workshop in applied poetics will present a
meandering survey of contemporary praxis in both page and stage traditions:
the focus will be on poets who write about their own process and through
this act create the discourse called "poetics." Emphasis will be on reading
(most of it done in class); much of the discussion will take place through
shared writing. This reading/writing continuum will synthesize into your ow=
n
poetic statement and / or performance -- and hopefully will work to
clarifying your writing practice.=B2 Kristin Prevallet is the author of Shado=

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

Dear Friends: I am excited to announce an innovative
and new creative writing program based in Brazil.

The CREATIVE WRITING PROGRAM at the ACADEMIA
INTERNACIONAL DE CINEMA is the first full time
comprehensive practical program in Brazil. It is
offered in three concentrations: poetry, fiction
(short story, novel, novela) and non-fiction
(biography, reportage, criticism). The students work
in small groups in workshops in their concentration,
creating their own texts with guidance week by week by
well known writers, developing their abilities and
their knowledge of form, style and critical analysis.
Both the workshops and the theory classes are focused
on contemporary writing -- subjects and writers
studied are references for the current Brazilian and
international literature. The themes of the seminaries
and lectures are relevant for writers today, such as
multimedia and multidisciplinary work, literary
market, vanguard and experimentalism, in addition to
more traditional studies of history of literature,
language, translation, methods of research, analysis
of important texts. Currently the one year program is
in Portuguese, but there will be intensive writing
workshops in English.

By the end of each semester, students will participate
on a reading open to the public. At the end of the
program, they will have completed a series of
exercises and finished a good number of pages of work.
As a final project, each student will present a
manuscript, which is than advanced draft of a literary
piece of his or her authorship.

Intensive Writing Workshop
Language: English
An intensive writing workshop taught in English is
scheduled to be offered at the AIC in July 2007. For
more information, please, contact info@aicinema.com.br

Board of Advisors
The AIC is honored to have American poets Yusef
Komunyakaa and Edward Hirsch on their Board of
Advisors. The AIC and Rattapallax magazine are
partners and develop programs to promote American and
Brazilian literature, films and culture.

Program Coordinator: Flávia Rocha is a Brazilian poet,
journalist and translator living in Brazil. In Sao
Paulo, she worked as a staff reporter for magazines
Casa Vogue, Carta Capital, República, Valor Econômico
and Bravo!, and was a contributor for other
publications, including MTV magazine, Vogue and Sabor.
She has an M.F.A program in Writing at Columbia
University and was the co-editor, with Edwin Torres,
of Cities of Chance: an Anthology of New Poetry from
the United States and Brazil. She co-founded Acedemia
Internacional de Cinema in Brazil. Her first
collection of poetry, The Blue House Around Noon was
released by Travessa dos Editores in 2004. She is also
an editor at Rattapallax.

Hi all,

Before i ask, I just wanted to thank everyone who responded to my UK Poetry info request a little while back. You folks are a wealth of information.

Anyhow, I'm going to be in Manila City for the next three weeks for work, and before I went, I wanted to see if anyone knew anything poetry or literature related worth checking out while I'm there.

Thanks in advance for your responses.

Arteroids 3.0
http://vispo.com/arteroids/arteroids311.htm

This is the battle of poetry against itself and the forces of dullness. A
literary shoot-em-up computer game.

Tired of the petty games of art and poetry? Try this petty game instead. Go
on a shooting spree. Paste text from your enemies into Word for Weirdos and
then shoot it up. The perfect game for psychotic poets, be they avant garde
or standard ivy league. Here is your monster poem.

There's a 'game mode' and a 'play mode'. In 'game mode', your scores are
based on speed and accuracy, and are saved to the Net. You try to max out
the meanometer by destroying sufficiently many texts. There are 216 levels
of play. In 'game mode', you progress through the 216 bardoroids (or can go
back and replay levels).

In 'play mode', scores aren't saved, you can skip among levels, change other
parameters, and work in Word for Weirdos.

I published version 1.0 of this piece in 2001. It still isn't finished.
Probably never will be. It may, however, one day be the world's first
addictive poem. The next feature I'll implement is the ability to
upload/download texts in Word for Weirdos. The main new feature in 3.0 is
that game mode scores are saved to the Net. I've also been working quite a
bit on the texts you read when you 'win' or 'die'. There are about 400 of
those, at this point. They muse on the relations of poetry, game, art, and
play.

[Please forward this message to all interested parties. Word of mouth
is, of course, how small presses survive!]

We at Atticus/Finch are going out of our damn minds daydreaming about
our newest book, and we simply couldn’t wait another minute to scream
about it at the top of our fragile, slightly crystallized lungs. We’re
a bit giddy about this one, and while it’s true we’re mostly giddy,
this time it’s justified. Friends, I’m honored to announce the release
of our eighth chapbook: Myung Mi Kim’s River Antes.

Since 2002’s Commons, Atticus/Finch has been hard at work trying to
secure the rights to Myung Mi Kim’s new project, and while this is not
entirely the case, it’s one hundred percent true that we’ve devoured
each and every magazine appearance we could find since then, praying
to whoever-it-is-these-days-who-publishes-fancy-trade-edition-books to
do the damn thing. In the meantime, we took matters in our own hands
and printed the most elegant book we had in us. And boy did we have it
in us…

River Antes begins where Commons left off: square in a highly charged
manifold where the constellated image of culture, language, and
signification stands as the analogue of the subject’s experience of
family, honor, and place. These poems challenge us to interface with
each event of language as the site of historical responsibility—the
instant in which what is said, what is claimed, resonates between what
was, what is to come, and what could have been.

There are only 150 copies of this book in the world, all made by my
two little hands to be held gently in yours. If you’d like a copy,
please order soon (as these books sell out FAST). If you are concerned
about getting a copy, please consider requesting a standing order for
future books.

And don’t forget to swing by our website, www.atticusfinch.org, to
read some sample poems and take a look at the cover (click on the
book’s title for all the details). We’re still working on getting Pay
Pal going on the web, so, until then, all books are mail-order only.

To obtain a copy, send $8 (well-concealed cash, check, or money order
(made payable to Michael Cross)) to:

[[One last word, if you’ve made it this far, about small press
publishing. I’ve received emails here and there wondering why these
books aren’t in bookstores, and why, finally, the print run is so
small. I don’t distribute these books because they sell out before I
can get them on the shelves. And they sell out because I can only,
realistically, print 150-200 by myself. I am absolutely committed to
getting these books into peoples lives, but I refuse to compromise the
quality of the product. I want to sew and fold and cut each book in a
manner that does justice to the labor of the poetry. And, in order to
make more, I’d have to make differently (i.e. mass produce, using
cheaper papers, etc.). My interest in chapbook publishing has always
been to bridge the gap between the poet and her readers. Instead of
waiting two to five to ten years to see a trade-edition in print, I’d
like to get the book quickly into the hands of folks who care, and I’d
like the book to transfer the labor of its production (as language, as
a thing, etc.) in order to do justice to the reader’s labor of
reception. I don’t plan on making these books any differently, but I
DO want to ensure that the folks that NEED get them. And in order to
do this, I need the support of the poetry community to help spread the
word to interested parties before my stock is bone dry. In the
meantime, I hope to make it easier to order off the webpage, and I
also hope to spend this year making free online e-books of all the
chapbooks that have sold out, as well as (and this may be pure
fantasy, but I’m going to do what I can) audio recordings of readings
from each manuscript. Finally (and I’m getting off topic here but I’m
on a roll!), I’m committed to investigating the chapbook as form,
versus chapbook as full-length teaser. This is why I am starting to
commission projects specifically for Atticus/Finch—works that
interrogate the mid-length poem, the short serial, the collaborative,
etc. Hope you’ll stay on board for the ride, and thanks for your
continued support!]]

But, if you do appear, keep your gravity and sedateness, and at the same

post this announcement. Thank you all for reading.)

So there were readings by authors one wanted to avoid in the days of Epictetus?  It seems like very little changes over time.  Of course, there are some one doesn't want to avoid, always including one's own, once in a while.As for the advice of how to appear at such events, I'm not sure that "sedateness" shouldn't read "sedation".  It might sometimes help, however, to be responsive rather than numb.

But, if you do appear, keep your gravity and sedateness, and at the same
time avoid being morose.

I don't know if this is fair, Rachel. Unless you are talking about
novelists!
I love to go to readings, love to give them. I am blessed to live in the Bay
Area where I have heard terrific stuff by young, older and visiting poets -
In venues that have ranged from living rooms to 300 seaters.

My ears like the treat (on the other hand, I have a hell of a resistance to
listening to poets on tape). Me likes it live and upfront! (I can usually
afford the expense of a reading - it has to be a good book before I fork up
the money - otherwise I wd be real broke).

Of course, like anyone else - I suspect - there are some poets I
instinctively won't go to hear. And I suspect there are those that have
similar responses to yours truly.  Without contraries, no grist for the mill
or the poet.

(Apologies for cross-posting)

Last night I saw some stunning political theatre. Full review up on
Theatre Notes -

Honour Bound, conceived, directed and co-designed by Nigel Jamieson.
Malthouse Theatre until October 1.

The correct question regarding the horrors committed in the camps...
is not the question that asks hypocritically how it could have been
possible to commit such atrocious horrors against other human beings;
it would be more honest, and above all more useful, to investigate
carefully how - that is, thanks to what juridical procedures and
political devices - human beings could have been so completely
deprived of their rights and prerogatives to the point that committing
any act toward them would no longer appear as a crime.
What is a Camp?, Giorgio Agamben

Honour Bound, Nigel Jamieson's beautiful and harrowing physical
theatre work about the Australian Guantanamo detainee David Hicks,
begins with a recording of a reading of the 1948 Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. It is almost an exercise in nostalgia to hear this
statement of ideals read with such solemnity and dignity:

"Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and
inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the
foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world; Whereas
disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous
acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of
a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief
and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest
aspiration of the common people..."

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is where legislative
language, in its passion for clarity and unambiguous precision,
attains an intensity of meaning akin to poetry. In 2006, it is hard to
remember the force of the horrified revulsion which in 1948 deemed
that such barbarities as Auschwitz must never happen again. Now such
ideas are considered the province of left wing extremists and
troublemakers. How we have moved on.

With his collaborators, Nigel Jamieson investigates the ways in which
these UN ideals have been dismantled and destroyed through the story
of David Hicks, who was captured fighting with the Taliban in
Afghanistan in 2001. Like many others, Hicks has been imprisoned since
by the US Government in Camp Delta at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba as an
"enemy combatant", a category invented to sidestep the Geneva
Convention's laws on the treatment of prisoners of war, and has
endured treatment which most civilised people would call torture.

In five years of captivity, he has been held without charge and
without a chance of having any allegations against him tested in a
court of law, and he has been allowed only one visit from his family,
during which he was shackled to the floor. One of the shameful
scandals of the Howard Government is how, unlike Britain - which
brought its nationals held in Camp Delta home out of concern that they
would be denied the due process of law - it has abandoned Hicks to his
fate. So much for the rule of law.

But equally, and equally importantly, Honour Bound is a revelation of
human pain: on the one hand, a father's grief at being unable to help
his troubled son, and on the other, the physical pain inflicted on
bodies by the State. Honour Bound demonstrates, in its darkest
manifestations, the power of language to change and remake reality. It
is exemplary political theatre-making of a rare intelligence and
power: neither didactic nor exploitative, appealing neither to
sentiment nor special pleading, it reveals its argument with a
devastating visceral impact which left the first night audience
stunned into silence.

This is pretty short notice - but I wanted to invite
you to the launch party for the new volume of X-tra
magazine!!!!=20
(as you may or may not know, I am an editorial board
member and contributing writer at X-tra)

We're celebrating tomorrow night, Saturday Sept. 16th
at Mandrake from 5 - 7pm (see below for details).

So, this is also my plea for you to subscribe, if you
don't already!!! X-tra is a great publication that is
non-profit, artist run, and reliant upon its
subscription base for many of the operating grants
that it receives. Your vote counts!!! X-tra is a
quarterly magazine dedicated to contemporary art, and
a year subscription is only $20!! We only ever have 4
pages of ads - so we don't fund the magazine that way.
We need YOU!=20

Please come and celebrate another volume, and consider
subscribing - or renewing your susciption!!

Hope to see you!

Sincerely,

Micol

About X-TRA 9.1

FEATURES: Mark Allen, Founder of Machine Projects in
Los Angeles,
discusses art, technology and the socialibility of
interactive
exhibitions with X-TRA editor Ken D. Allan. Michel
Oren observes Lee
Mullican=92s conception of the finished work as a record
of the process
of painting as spiritual quest. Ellen Birrell writes
an appreciation
for her graduate school mentor Robert Heinecken.=20

ARTIST=92S PROJECT: In The Benefits of Things Flawed and
The Repulsive
Attractiveness of Frienemies, Angie Waller=92s diagrams
explore how flaws
and imperfections can increase desirability.

REVIEWS: Elusive residents lurk in the water of a
hi-tech/
eco-friendly installation at Materials & Applications
in Silverlake.
For Chris Bedford, Manfred Pernice=92s opaque exscape
installation at
Regen Projects requires laborious engagement of
viewers to reveal its
conceptual premise. Allan deSouza finds that despite
their restraint,
Jeanne Dunning=92s corporal photographs at the Berkeley
Museum aim to get
under your skin. MoMA=92s installation obscures the raw
vitality of
Edvard Munch=92s painting. Kyungmi Shin observes that a
surprise
intrusion takes a Nam June Paik memorial performance
closer to the
provocative spirit of Paik=92s work.=20

COLUMN: Hurricane Carla, Mapplethorpe=92 s bull whip,
and a cow ramming
inspire three photographers in the latest installment
of Micol Hebron=92s
1 Image 1 Minute, a contemporary recreation of an
eponymous project by
French director Agn=E8s Varda.

Just A Sec For Whiteboys In Afrika (downy dub)


     These young Black artists utilize their own vernacular, the
language they have created, to tell their stories. We scoff when they
tell us they have redefined the ‘N’ word. Many of us were offended by
the use of the term “Ebonics”; we said we wanted our youth to speak
“good English” so that they would get a job. But Black youth not only
created their own language,...Are artists falsely creating negative
images or simply expressing the realities that exist for a segment of
Black America? We will not be able to change the images the Black
experience has created until we are able to change the experiences that
have influenced them.

"The U.S. imperialist ruling class’s brutal war against the Vietnamese
people had drawn billions of dollars away from the social needs of
people in the United States....In 1982, Grandmaster Flash and the
Furious Five released the song, The Message. The hook of the song is,
“…don’t push me, cuz I’m close to the edge/I’m trying not to lose my
head/huh, huh,/it’s like a jungle sometimes/makes me wonder how I keep
from going under.” The song was about the daily, deplorable conditions
that Blacks live under, especially in urban areas with gross
unemployment and underemployment, police brutality, drug epidemics and
much more...." -- Larry Hales -- "Hip-hop culture reflects Youth

and

Inseparable from this assault on the social position of working class
has been the exaltation of individual pursuit of wealth and celebrity,
as well as the marginalization and denigration of the victims of
capitalist restructuring....With the corporate media acting as a chorus,
Bush and his cronies have repeatedly celebrated the wanton destruction
wrought by US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan as “taking out the
enemy”...As for Stephen Harper’s Conservatives, they have made the
Canadian Armed Forces’ participation in the NATO counter-insurgency
operation in southern Afghanistan their government’s defining
initiative. Their aim is to use the Afghan intervention to put paid to
any notion of the CAF as a peacekeeper, rather than a warrior-force for
promoting the interests of the Canadian elite on the world
stage....While Gill considered himself an outsider, the images on his
blog of him striking various warrior poses bear the imprint of movies
like Rambo and of a political environment increasingly infected with
militarism and social reaction.-- Keith Jones -- "Mass shooting in Montreal"

"On September 5, Crown prosecutors exonerated a Royal Canadian Mounted
Police (RCMP) constable for shooting Ian Bush, a 22-year-old sawmill
worker, in the back of the head. Bush was shot 20 minutes after his
arrest on October 29, 2005, for holding an open beer in the parking lot
of a hockey arena in Houston, British Columbia. At the time of his
death, he was in the process of being released by the police agency." --

I'm delighted to announce the publication of the 50th title from Wild Honey
Press: _The Moon Sees the One_ by Candice Ward.

14.5x21 cm, 44 pages, 250 gsm green Strata card cover, black endpapers,
hand-sewn with dark green twist.
Price euro5 / USD 5 / STG 3.50.

"_The Moon Sees the One_ is preoccupied with vision and points of view. Even
those poems that don't directly
address sight or perspective are shaped to be comprehended by the eye. Yet
sound, too, is
emphasized, with the element of song reinforced by epigraphs drawn from
popular music. The collection,
framed by poems concerned with vanishing, is also thematically unified by
the confluence of blindness
and silence. Given its preoccupations, this chapbook may surprise readers
with its often humorous tone,
while its passionate engagement with the relationship between desire and all
five senses is unequivocally
serious."

poems and see the cover image by artist Brendan Campbell.

If the wonders of e-mail has mangled the link, just go to
www.wildhoneypress.com and take it from there.

Since literature is the best currency, I'm happy to swap a copy for poems in
any form.

best

activity, help direct undergraduate and graduate research/creative
activity,  teach undergraduate and graduate courses, advise students, and

reading the hysteria in the new york times about the youtube.com
phenom and latest blair witch, lonelygirl15, i noticed the citation
for the literary term "false document".   The paper says it comes
from Rexroth, even if the genre/technique, etc., is older, growing
perhaps out of the epistolary novel form.

This seems to be a favorite genre of many of our era, and I'm
wondering what Rexroth it comes from...it is not in the one book of
essays of his that I have...

Anyone know this??   thanks--

yeah, Stephen, I got scared away when I saw such an amazing =20
difference between about.com and wikipedia for the most basic =20
information.

i should have known there would be something at bopsecrets.org -- ken =20=

knabb's site has so much of the situ stuff i forgot about his shrine.

and i think there might be another essay that talks about this in =20
"classics revisited"

as the old man says here, writing of Defoe:

"Unless we are romantic adolescents or barbarians, we never think of =20
Ivan Karamazov or Emma Bovary as real people, not anyway when we have =20=

escaped from the delusion of the hypnotism of immediate reading. Most =20=

novels provide their greatest satisfaction when they are finished and =20=

we look back over them, or rather, through them. The novel as a =20
whole, not any character, is an artistic structure that reorganizes =20
experience. The narratives of Crusoe, Moll Flanders, and Roxana are =20
intended to affect us as though we had discovered them in an old =20
trunk in the attic that had come down through the family, a bundle of =20=

papers that cracked as we opened them, written in a long out-of-date =20
hand and tied with ribbons that disintegrated at our touch. We are =20
supposed to be put in direct encounter with persons, a specific man, =20
two specific women. Everything is stripped to the bare, narrative =20
substance, and it is this that reveals the psychology or morality of =20
the individual. The most significant details are purely objective, =20
exterior. The interiority of the characters is revealed by their =20
elaborately presented outside. When they talk about their own =20
motives, their psychology, their morals, their self-analyses and self-=20=

justifications are to be read backwards, as of course is true of most =20=

people, certainly of any bundle of letters we might find in the =20
attic. This is true even of autobiographers who are famous for their =20
sincerity. If we believe everything that Amiel and Marie Bashkirtseff =20=

say about themselves, we are going to start off in life with =20
misleading and sentimental ideas of human nature. It is the =20
na=EF=BF=BDvet=EF=BF=BD of his critics that has led to Defoe=E2=80=99s =
reputation for =20
superficial or nonexistent psychology."

actually Flaubert famously wrote on one occaision at least that he WAS Mme.
Bovary--

a "fictional character" can take on lives of their own and have influences
as powerful as "any persons living or dead"--

the fictional painter Gulley Jimson of Joyce Cary's novel THE HORSE'S MOUTH
has been an immense influence on my life and work and co-dedicatee with Bob
Cobbing of my book "found rubBEings" (2nd ed. now out from xexoxial ed.)

(in conversation with Bob Cobbing and Paul Dutton, i said Bob was Gulley--to
which they said--no, YOU are Gulley Jimson!  So you have an idea how real

Who is Michael Savage?  As far as I know, he's no relative of mine.  Is he a poet or a painter?  Anyway, it's interesting that someone else with my last name has appeared on the scene so I'd like to know.  Regards, Tom Savage

UNFINISHED POEM #8364

Come my friend,
Let=92s play that game again.
This time I=92ll let you win,
For you so love to win,
And I love to play.

I don=92t know why,
It often goes so hard,
Or if we=92re truly bound to fall
Is it fate, or is it fortunate,
Or just some cosmic law?

But here we are,
In the realm of Avalon,
Where the broken go to hide.
Here we are in the circle of now,
The border=92s long, but it is not wide.

          (the forthcoming Chicago Review is a Rexroth issue)

          speaking of fictional Japanese, there is the poetry of Yasusada,
the book of his letters and forthcoming book of essays and criticism on
him/his work etc--let alone years of documentation built up around this
figure--all of which has made a fictional poet one of the better known ones
of our times in many ways--(will there be a film of it someday--fictional or
documentary or hybrid--by real or fictional film makers--with
interviews--further documentations--visits to sites in the
poems--discussions among scholars--etc etc--)--

     some other extraordinary documents--when the painter di Chirico was
getting older and his neo-classical style not selling well at all, he
realized the only way for him to make a good living was to begin to forge as
it were works done in his early famous Scuola Metafisica style--an elaborate
underatking in that he had to recreate/find canvases and paints from the
rather narrow time period in which these had been done, and put his mind
back into the spaces in which it had been to invent the originals--and then
to slowly find ways to leak these "new finds of previously uknown works"
into the world in such a way that he could profit from them without arousing
suspsicion . . . what makes the works so problmatic is that they are
forgeries done by the artist himself, yet the artist at a later stage who
has left behind his earlier beliefs and style, frocing himself to re-enact
his foremer self i order to create in his former stle with something
bordering on a recreation of his former convitions--in short, a bizarre form
of those "re-enactments" done for documentaries--

       another turly incredible example is Bunuel's great documentary--(as
it is listed/described on line) LAS HURDES (1933; Land Without Bread in
English)--which is almost always taken at face value as a real documentary
though done with many of Bunuel's characteristic early touches--the closeups
of insects, etc--often interpreted by esp Leftist critics as an anti-Franco
anti-clerical film, it is actually a brutally realistic fiction-that is
everything photographed is "real"--it is the voice-over narration that
creates the fiction---amazingly the one clue which shd give it away is taken
seriously--that the people in the film live in a part of Spain in which
bread had not been known until very recently--an area so cut off, without
any culture whatsoever, abandoned by the Church, and with a population
reduced to freaks and idicocy and insanity by intermarriage--it is a
Bunuelian vision of Spain so intensely realized that it actually passes as
"reality"--rather than an anarchist/surrealist form of allegory--

the combination of realistic photgrpahy and invented narration--and the
effectiveness of this--is an interesting comment on detournement before
detournement was given a name--
that one can change images by the texts attached to them--
a dangerous game, too--
like the game we'd play as kids--take foto from the paper of a man--just
about any man--or woman--
put underneath it--"the famous poet so and so"
and show it so someone--
oh--the sensitiveness of the features! the delicacy of the mouth!--the
burning insights that lurk in those eyes!
put under the foto the caption "child rapist"
'what a monster!--fires of hell flicker in his eyes!--the sadistic curl of
his lips! the violence of the jawline!"
a woman's foto--
"star actress gives to chidlrens flu shots funds"
"what goodness shines in her features . . . a look of angelic mercy . . the
Florence Nightingale of the footlights . . . "
give her another caption
"U.S. Senator charged with bribery, extortion,corruption, fraud, wire
tapping"--
"her hard jaw set in a clench and eyes squinting  . . . Wll Ice Queen Melt
In Fire of Accusations--"

and how many times doesnt this actually happen?--today's foto of anyone with
a good caption--tomorrow's with a bad--"that's entertainment"--or "regime
chnage"--or "canon formation"--or "changing tastes"--or "making a
comeback"--

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present a reading by

CA Conrad & Magdalena Zurawski
Friday, September 22, 2006 at 7:30 p.m.


Philadelphia legend CA Conrad joins us in celebration of his first book,
Deviant Propulsion (Soft Skull Press). Eileen Myles says “I'm a huge fan of
CAConrad's poems--he's Gay Sunshine anew. Plus George Herbert & Harold Norse,
Creeley and early Judy Grahn. Soupy Sales too! His fairy love poem to George
W. Bush should be read aloud to every high school assembly in the world. Watch
out, I think he has an agenda! CAConrad is boldly recruiting all of us to
commit the/muscle/ to love. Is the opposite of a hate crime a love crime?
Well, this is it.”



Magdalena Zurawski was born in Newark, NJ in 1972 to Polish immigrants. Her
work has been published in American Poet: The Journal of the Academy of
American Poets, The Poetry Project Newsletter, Rattapallax, and other
magazines. Her chapbooks include Bruised Nickelodeon (Hophophop Press). She
lives in San Francisco, blogs as minoramerican, and recently finished writing
her first novel, The Bruise, sections of which were published this summer in
chapbook form by Oakland's new Taxt Press.

Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to current SPT
members and CCA faculty, staff, and students.

Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in Timken Lecture Hall,
California College of the Arts 1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the
intersection of 16th & Wisconsin). Directions & map:

Superbunker (http://www.superbunker.com) has released it's first book in a
series of machinic texts. This 254 page book,"i feel better after i type to
you," is an un-edited reproduction of the search queries of AOL user
23187425 from May 2006. (http://www.lulu.com/content/412471)
This strange server log autobiography was found in the released AOL search
queried by Thomas Claburn (http://tinyurl.com/p3wvc).
The text in this book is pseudo-anonymous autobiography stored as
proprietary corporate data which was de facto released into the public
domain. In the face of such a text, notions of "copyright" seem like quaint
anachronisms from a bygone era. For what it's worth, this edition is
published under a Creative Commons Attribution license (

Half of the profit from each book sold will go to the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (http://www.eff.org/).

Dear Poetics List,

I'd like to send out an open invitation for anyone who might be interested:

I'm seeking a motivated candidate who would like to moderate an online
discussion about New Media Poetry / E-Poetry / Digital Poetry on the
Leonardo Electronic Almanac website. This will coincide with the publication
of the forthcoming issue on the same topic which I recently guest-edited.

We're already considering some candidates for this, but I thought I'd post
the invite here too, just in case. Send me a message backchannel at

tscotpeterson@hotmail.com

Best, Tim

Stephen! I meant no offense and was mostly goofing on the way the Priestley
set off that bit of Epictetus.

Stephen and I gave more than one reading together, thousands of years ago,
as part of a large group. I think I may still have some of the posters. And
certainly I've been to readings that ripped me up in the best ways--Ted
Berrigan at Berkeley Poetry Conference when I was still in my teens, for
instance. There are readings so strong (or aesthetic encounters so
coruscating) that one's whole life becomes unthinkable without them.

But you know that and I say more power to the listeners, to those who, like
you, test-drive their ears. There are people I'd give anything to hear right
now and (with any luck) someday I will be in a room with, say, Linh Dinh or
Jennifer L. Knox or Anne Boyer or Lara Glenum.

I don't think you would deny, though, that occasionally people (not people
like you) go to readings for other reasons--social and/or political
necessity etc. Often there are concrete benefits for doing so. Alliances are
forged and reinforced. People pick friends and enemies. This is reassuring
to others because they know where to slot you. You are perceived as being
part of a "community," and when the anthologies that represent that
community are published, you are in them.

And of course those who didn't turn up over and over, carefully greasing
those wheels and currying favor with their brethren and sistren, are not. *A
Gathering of Amherst Poets*, published in 1880, wouldn't have included Emily
Dickinson (or other mute ingloriosities), but this wouldn't have affected by
one jot the warmth, even the smugness, of its reception. Was Dickinson part
of the literary community of Amherst? Yes, but your ear would have had to be
very close to the ground indeed to know it, and you wouldn't have had any
help from the Mr. Higginsons of the time.

So this is how our craft, our sullen art, stumbles forward. Or doesn't.
Right, Stephen, or anyone who cares to reply? Wrong again, perhaps!

Would have responded much sooner but was waylaid by a horrible late-summer
bug which took me down and then thrashed the resident Finn.

I don't know if this is fair, Rachel. Unless you are talking about
novelists!
I love to go to readings, love to give them. I am blessed to live in the Bay
Area where I have heard terrific stuff by young, older and visiting poets -
In venues that have ranged from living rooms to 300 seaters.

My ears like the treat (on the other hand, I have a hell of a resistance to
listening to poets on tape). Me likes it live and upfront! (I can usually
afford the expense of a reading - it has to be a good book before I fork up
the money - otherwise I wd be real broke).

Of course, like anyone else - I suspect - there are some poets I
instinctively won't go to hear. And I suspect there are those that have
similar responses to yours truly.  Without contraries, no grist for the mill
or the poet.

To say that Dickinson was part of the literary community of Amherst, you
would have to be using an entirely geographical definition of community,
whereas I prefer to use one that is based on interpersonal relationships
and, in the case of a literary community, mutual influence.

I currently live in Brooklyn, but I am certainly not a part of any Brooklyn
or New York literary community and would feel very odd being included in an
anthology of any such community.  I suspect that Dickinson would've felt the
same about being included in an Amherst anthology if not, in fact, more
hostile.

Hi Elizabeth,

Re: "mutual influence," are you saying that in order to be part of a
community one must have been influenced by immediate others and also an
influence on them? Wouldn't this exclude the most original figures in our
midst, or hiding at our margins, and make "community" a very pale,
comfortable, enervated thing indeed?

But yes, Dickinson's hostility goes without saying--my god, sweet
Vesuvius-at-Home with her horror of Publication as "the Auction / Of the
Mind of Man"! And yet she did seek out literary figures and who knows how
much of her hauteur was of a protesting-too-much sort, because, more than
anything, one didn't want to seem to be seeking the limelight.

But my point was really about literary schmoozing and the realm of
possibility, and I just gave those what I think of as the Dickinson test,
and as usual they came up wanting.

Emily D. had her own ideas about Geography, of course, and apparently felt
that volcanoes (and perhaps other powers) would do well to come to her:

Volcanoes be in Sicily
And South America
I judge from my Geography--
Volcanoes nearer here
A Lava step at any time
Am I inclined to climb--
A Crater I may contemplate
Vesuvius at Home.

Last time I checked, community was a comfortable thing.  I have a difficult
time conceptualizing the dynamics of a literary community in which mutual
influence wouldn't play a part.  That's not to say that everyone in a
community would write the same way, but yes, it would exclude certain
writers.  And I'm not sure that's a problem when trying to define
community.

There's a certain slant of light that margin dwellers see.   Some writers,
on the other hand, benefit more from community, and those of us who live
long enough may move from one to the other and back again.

Of course, when one enters into a literary community not for the purposes of
creating better art but rather with the goal of padding one's publication
products, there is something distasteful to it (to me).  But then, I think
there are very few of us who burn are poems as soon as they are written.
And most of us do something to get our work out there.

> Vesuvius at Home.

I think this was Bush at his news conference on Friday on the lawn of his
White House 'home'. I thought the guy was about to go off the hook in his
fury (about not being able to strangle people).

If anybody can be the cause of bringing Vesuvius into this country
(somebody's Hail George Nuke), he would be the one.

Why is one man permitted to depress the hell out of the world?

This last weekend I was privileged to listen and talk to a distinguished gathering of international poets for a “Resilience of the Human Spirit” meeting in Arlo Guthrie’s Conference Center in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. The center is in the old Alice ’s Restaurant, once a church. One of the lines in Guthrie’s song “ Alice ’s Restaurant” is about the possibility of a song changing the world. These poets come from places of genocide, firing squads, chemical warfare, political imprisonment, radiation poisoning, mass burial, and strategic rape. And yet they continue to sing.

  I’m afraid I identified most strongly with Li-Young Lee who said that he was not resilient, and that he did not know anyone who was resilient and with Alexandre Kemenyi who said the Rwandan massacres had left him feeling like a monster who thought that any single death at this point was not important enough to be awakened at 3 AM to find out about.

  But these feelings are probably defensive measures, because when the poetry gets going, the heart opens, and the gasp of aliveness and shared connection occurs.

  Iranian poet Majid Naficy told a story about a Persian king who so loved his horse that he warned that anyone who told him of his horse’s death would be executed. When the beast did die, the courtiers asked for the help of a musician who played for the king a composition of such beauty that when it ended the king remarked, “So, my horse is dead!”

  Let’s hope that we continue to create and to share work of such beauty that our readers and students themselves find understanding.

Wallis, Stephen, Elizabeth, others,

In times like these I find myself rereading "Deor," an Old English =
lament
from about thirteen centuries ago. Literary bitterness, political =
tyranny,
world-weariness, broken community, the exiled poet Deor has seen it all =
and
stubbornly comes back to his refrain, "Thaes ofereode, thisses swa maeg"
(That went by; this may too). It's a good thing to turn to after the =
latest
unbearable shenanigans in Washington, or anytime you need the long view.

Here are the last few stanzas, in Michael Alexander's translation:

We all know that Eormanric
had a wolf's wit. Wide Gothland
lay in the grasp of that grim king,
and through it many sat, by sorrows environed,
foreseeing only sorrow; sighed for the downfall
and thorough overthrow of the thrall-maker.

     That went by; this may too.

When each gladness has gone, gathering sorrow
may cloud the brain; and in his breast a man
can not then see how his sorrows shall end.
But he may think how throughout this world
it is the way of God, who is wise, to deal
to the most part of men much favour
and a flourishing fame; to a few the sorrow-share.

Of myself in this regard I shall say this only:
that in the hall of the Heodenings I held long the makarship,
lived dear to my prince, Deor my name;
many winters I held this happy place
and my lord was kind. Then came Heorrenda,
whose lays were skillful; the lord of fighting-men
settled on him the estate bestowed once on me.

     That went by; this may too.

Hi,

Hoping someone can fill me in on the fate of Freehand.  Hugh Steinberg and
Miles Durrance were the editors.  Was the first issue ever produced?  It's
been a long time since it was due out and the email address I have-
freehandjournal@yahoo.com- is failing so I'm assuming it met a bad end but
hope not.

War on Words : The John Bradley/Tomaz Salamun* Confusement.


Featuring Correspondence and Occasional Outbursts of Poetry
by Tomaz Salamun* and John Bradley
With a Preface by Patti Smith

ISBN: 0975922734
$15

"Wow! It might be Nonsalamuns may not enjoy as much as I did, but for our
tribe--- I went through different stages: shock, amazement, I was pale,
laughter - a lot -, awe, guilt, aphssss!, even my mind wanted to take off
for a moment, but mostly gratitude, I was moved; I am moved."
- Tomaz Salamun


In the first episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus, near the end of the
sketch, "The Funniest Joke in the World" (which chronicles the exploits of
"the killer joke"), Eric Idle soberly announces, "In 1945, Peace broke out.
It was the end of the Joke.  Joke warfare was banned at a special session of
the Geneva Convention."  John Bradley similarly investigates the inside-out
of things in his explosive new book, War on Words, in which the "war" he
wages on conventional language, on our bought and staid habits of mind, is a
discursive demolition that interrogates the contamination of the very root
systems of our words and concepts of "ownership," "voice," and "intellectual
property."  Profoundly Surreal, but never merely clever, Bradley's work
glistens with the ebullience of the 1920's Libertine, sounding him as a
clear inheritor of La Revolution Surrealiste, and his poems are as
remarkable, meaningful, and necessary as anything being written today.  War
on Words is an extraordinary book, seriously playful in the ways
anthropologist Clifford Geertz might describe the significance of "deep
play" among the indigenous cultures of Bali.  I have read Bradley's work
faithfully for more than 25 years, and it is no exaggeration to say he is
one of the two or three most important poets among us.  But for those of you
who distrust enthusiasm, earned and tempered in this case as it most
certainly is, let me simply say, "This is a good book.  I like it a lot."
-George Kalamaras


John Bradley is one of the hidden Greats. And this utterly riveting Poetic
Detective story is the greatest collaboration in American poetry since Jack
Spicer's After Lorca. It will also prove to be, I have no doubt, Tomaz
Salamun's most famous book.
-Kent Johnson


John Bradley received an MA in English from Colorado State University and an
MFA in Creative Writing from Bowling Green State University. His book of
poetry Love-In-Idleness won the Washington Prize. He is the editor of Atomic
Ghost: Poets Respond to the Nuclear Age and Learning to Glow: A Nuclear
Reader. Bradley lives with his wife, Jana, in DeKalb, where he teaches
writing at Northern Illinois University. He is the recipient of a National
Endowment of the Arts Fellowship in poetry.

Thanks for the info -- Do you have a bio for your own self I can use
to promote your reading with Ray Bianchi, Lou Suarez, and Mollie
Chambers here in Gallery 324 on October 21?

And don't forget I ask each poet to read a poem by a poet he or she
admires as a prelude to reading his or her own poetry.

Thanks!

Dear all,

WSQ (formerly Women's Studies Quarterly, published by the Feminist Press) is=

doing an issue on Activisms. I'd be happy to consider submissions of=20

other countries/cultures are very much encouraged.

I'm pasting the general call for submissions below, but please note that it=20
is a call for academic papers on the subject, so all of the criteria are not=

meant to apply to poems. As always, your approach to the theme may be "slant=

Please email submissions to ossipk@aol.com by November 15, 2006. Paste the=20
poems into the body of the email and include all your contact info, includin=

Kathleen Ossip

Does anyone know of venues/theater companies/radio stations/etc. that produce
readings of verse plays? I've written a verse play so I'm looking for places
that are open to submissions or queries. I'm starting from complete ignorance,
so all suggestions are welcome. Front- or backchannel.

hey thanks for the "tip o' the hat" rob, steve, all

i was mostly just checking to see if this old account was still "attached"
(maybe the powers that be (is Lori emerson still here?) could switch me
over to my new account: ross_priddle@yahoo.ca   .... i remember meeting
Lori in the special collections at U. of Vic. in 1999? i was looking at
bpNichol's Milt the Morph and she wanted to take it from me!

which brings me to HAT #124 which includes an order form by jwcurry who is
going to be doing a marathon reading of bpNichol's "Martyrology" at the
end of September/ beginning of October in Toronto (i'm sure rob mclennan
can provide us with more details if they aren't here already)

so, yes, i am calling for "subs." by which i mean submissions (but also
subscriptions) HAT wants to know what you are up to! snail subs to:

#9 Vista Rd. SE
Medicine Hat, Alberta
T1B 4S9
CANADA

e-mail subs to ross_priddle@yahoo.ca (willing to try all file types
including paypal!)

HAT #124 also includes a "found" cover by yours truly
hat #123 has a cartoon cover from Vittore Baroni & a flyer from Mike
Dickau
(hat #122) has a postcard from gustave morin & a text from Jim Hayes
hat #121 has a collage by Emilio Morandi & another collage by Lancillotto
Bellini
#120 has a painting by Allan Revich & a collage by David Dellafiora
119 has two addnpasses by Ray Johnson & everybody

Helmes
#117 has a page by rob read & aem and an ad by Daniel f. Bradley

  To Topos, a journal of international poetry, invites submissions for its tenth volume on the subject of poetry and poverty guest edited by Dr. Karen Holmberg.  Welcoming work from individuals of all cultures, regions, nations, and groups, we call upon poets to replace the abstract with the tangible, to give substance to the voices and faces of those on whom our corporate economy depends and who are often relegated to a state of silence.   We hope to collect a body of work that renders the truth of this most comprehensive form of oppression.  The issue will include a preface by Michael Parenti.  Submissions may be in any language if accompanied by English translation, and must be received by October 1, 2006.

  To submit, click on http://oregonstate.edu/dept/foreign_lang/totopos/index.html

  Karen Holmberg’s first book, The Perseids, won the Vassar Miller Prize in 2001, and her work has appeared in such magazines as The Paris Review, The Nation, Slate, Quarterly West and Southern Poetry Review.  She lives in Corvallis, OR, where she teaches in the MFA program at Oregon State University.

    Michael Parenti is an award winning author and activist who has published numerous books, including Superpatriotism (2004), and The Assassination of Julius Caesar (2003) which won the “Book of the Year Award” (nonfiction) from Online Review of Books. His most recent work is The Culture Struggle  (2006). For further information, visit his website:  www.michaelparenti.org.



  About To Topos
  To Topos is an international poetry journal that features poetry in translation, oftentimes the original appears together with its English translation. The following is excerpted from our Poet's Market entry:

"To Topos is committed to fostering human rights on an environmentally fragile planet. Its focus is altermondialist, recognizing that the causes of poverty and injustice are often related to race, gender, nationality, and the effacement of earth-given resources. Most issues are thematically focused.

  "Previous themes include Incarceration, Peace and the Sea, Forests, and North African Voices.  Winona LaDuke (White Earth Land Recovery Project) and Dr. William F. Schulz (Amnesty International) have prefaced recent issues. The journal is open to both aspiring and recognized poets. The journal particularly invites submissions from refugees and the borderless. The journal is primarily interested in living poets who believe words carry the gift of positive social change.

"The mission of this journal is to reveal the human face of poetry as a statement of urgency in today's world. The journal is open to all aesthetic and stylistic orientations, but submissions should be a seed for social change along humanist principles without indulging in political or nationalist rhetoric."

Just released, an issue dedicated to Contemporary Hungarian Poetry, guest edited by Eniko Bollobas of Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest. A copy of which was presented to the Hungarian Prime Minister, who's leadership is now being questioned.  Is To Topos responsible for this potential coup?   To find out, purchase a copy.

  To purchase copies of this Hungarian issue, or other back issues:
  http://oregonstate.edu/dept/foreign_lang/totopos/index.html

  For our next issue, we are in the process of reading the nearly 400 submissions for our Indigenous Americas: Poetry by Indigenous Peoples of the Western Hemisphere issue, guest edited by Allison Hedge Coke, Northern Michigan University. In May, Ms. Hedge Coke addressed the United Nations regarding the effect of publication impact on Indigenous Human Rights.

  Future themes include Contemporary Turkish Poetry and Contemporary Belgian Poetry.

Our 2004 issue on Forests features an introduction by Winona LaDuke and was given a favorable review in the prominent French poetry journal, Friches. The 2005 issue on North African Voices was featured on www.babelmed.net.

We just received an Oregon Literary Arts Fellowship for Publishers grant earlier this year. Our pages include works by the likes of academics, asylum inmates, Nobel and Pulitzer candidates, scholars, and farmers.

It is autumn, and we're gearing up for the 'Little Mags' section of the next
issue at www.BigBridge.org. We are looking to feature print 'zines and
magazines on the arts. We'll feature magazines of a variety of aesthetics
and production values, offering well-selected literary and/or visual pretty
things. To get an idea of what we'll be doing, please check out
http://www.bigbridge.org/littlemag.htm

If you'd like us to consider featuring your magazine, please send it to:

Jonathan Penton
P.O. Box 281
Guerneville, CA 95446

I'll be reviewing magazines until New Year's, though you might want to drop
me a line if you plan to send one after October, to verify I can still be
reached at that address.

Thanks for your time,

     Hello all.

       I'm trying to find out the location of Stein's "Tender Buttons" mss. Like Eric, I looked in the Yale data base & came up empty. Found several Stein mss in South Carolina, does anyone know where "TB" is?
       Many Thanks,

   Jason,

     I went to their website. You have to choose an option, ie click "Real Estate", "Criminal", and they didn't have a link for "literary", so I kind of got scared away. May try again. Nick Lolordo guided me to the Yale Library, they have the mss, but I need to find out as much about it as I can, how it compares to the Claire Marie 1914 edition, etc. Thanks for your help, I appreciate it.
       Best,
         Adam Fieled                 afieled@yahoo.com

I'm guessing that an estate executor would be involved in Real Estate law? I'm curious about what you're working on that you want to do these comparisons. I've been obsessed with Tender Buttons for a couple of years and have a couple extensively marginalia'd copies of the Green Integer edition. I'm even in the process of writing a to-be self-published response to Tender Buttons titled Household Activities. Would you be so kind as to keep me informed of what results you come up with in your investigations, y'know, paper publication or what not?

You might first look to Pound and his archives, as he helped Wms with this
"experimental" ms.  Pound suggested the title to Wms. who was thrashing for
his own form in the early 1920s.  Kora, lovely in itself, provided Wms with
the three-tiered lyric stanza, as you probably know.   It seems crazy that
the mss. isn't right there with the rest of Wms' mss.  Kora was originally
published in 1920 by The Four Seasons Company, Boston.  In 1957 City Lights
Books reprinted it as a Pocket Poets edition.  I have it in my hand.
Contact Robert Sharrard there.  He will surely be of use.

Regarding question about verse plays:
  New Yorkers are probably quite familiar with Bromley's plays. They're briliant.

I too saw the Warhol documentary at the Film Forum and was mostly pleased with it.  It did seem a bit strange that, of the whole four hours, only the last fifteen minutes were used to cover the period between the attempt on Warhol's life and his eventual death.  Since he lived more than a decade after the attack, this seemed odd.Other than that, the documentary seemed good and informative.

what would an Andy Warhol tribute that didn't go over the top be?

I did appreciate the fairly lengthy part dedicated to his early work
as a commercial artist -- what we usually get is a quick look at that
same shoe, and then a straight jump into pop --

you can scan it and upload it and you can do with it what you will, but
there are no problems with American copyrights, payments, etc.... but you
can't strictly legally scan for re-use editions derived from public domain
materials, even if the only difference is an added intro (i.e., it is a lot
easier to find Vachel Lindsay's film book in its recent republication than
in the pre-1922 version, and even though the body of the book is edited to
the original, or maybe even just a reprint, and you can't reuse that)

Hello,

As pasted below, Peter Baker and I have put out word on a collection of
essays on Ted Berrigan's poetics – and we encourage you all to use this
occasion. But, and more specific to this medium, we want to hear from you
as your views may bear in a less formal/academic way...

Namely, what we have in mind is, opening this thread (or any lines that it
may engender), to take our ad hoc thoughts about, feeling for, and
responses to Ted Berrigan's work (in its largest sense) as they may relate
to his poetics and edit and publish them as a text in and of itself in the
book. What we have in mind is a flash poeticism/criticism on Berrigan
poetics, which might, in its realized state, compass anything from phrases
or sentences to more spun out, considered writings with textual citations,
critical and theoretical references, digital images, etc.

This would seem to do a number of things: Act as a core sample of where
and how Berrigan’s poetics weigh at this point in time (their immediate
influences and uses); use the medium much as Berrigan himself might have
used it, fast and various and furious; and give everybody an opportunity
to be heard (as some may lack the time to write more expansively).

Look forward to hearing and with much thanks,
Sam and Peter

-------------------------------------------------------------

TED BERRIGAN. Papers are solicited for a collection of essays tentatively
titled "'Just like Me!': The Poetics of Ted Berrigan". The collection's
intent is to weigh Berrigan's poetic practice--its mode, pith, and
energy--including (though not limited to) his lineage, his brazen
democratic pelt, his chattiness, his writings' superfluid occasions, and
the immediacy and endlessness of his "heartistic" transmission.

IIn part, the 2005 publication of _The Collected Poems of Ted Berrigan_
makes this critical assessment of his poetics timely, since most of his
production is now readily available. Additionally, this proposed
collection of essays emerges out of a concern that, aside from the role
Berrigan played through his personality and vision's force as
gravitational center for New York poets, direct attention to his method
has been relatively scant. At the same time, the editors acknowledge that
essays addressing Berrigan's participation and influence in an
understanding of a New York (or any other polistic) school are
fundamentally valuable but ask that essays dealing with such a topic use
Berrigan's poetics as a focus.

Send manuscripts (following MLA style, and in Microsoft Word or rich-text
format) and 1-page vitae by 5 February 2007 to both editors, Peter Baker
(Pbaker@towson.edu) and Sam Truitt (samtruitt@yahoo.com). Queries are
encourage, as are abstracts, though final essays will be due in February.

Ted Berrigan and Me:
Ted Berrigan died when I was three.
I think I was three. I don't know what year it was off the top of my head, =
but 1981 sounds right so I'll go with it.

For me. As a writer. Which I hate to say because it sounds so pretentious. =
And that's the thing that's best about Ted Berrigan is that no matter how w=
eird he was being and how caught up he seems to have been in the lives of v=
arious writers who were friends of his. Well whatever. I'm not going to tal=
k about that. Because this is just a response to a thread on a list serv fu=
ll up of people, some of whom I know don't like me and aren't probably goin=
g to read this, so who cares. And

What is that right now it's 12:37am in Manila where I'm sitting looking at =
the clock on this laptop that I haven't adjusted the time on so it's saying=
 it's 9:41am in Seattle. Which means it's 12:41 pm yesterday in New York Ci=
ty. Or maybe 12:38. I suppose it depends on whose watch you look at.

Ted Berrigan is my favorite poet. Of all poets, Ted Berrigan has meant the =
most to me. In fact, I love Ted Berrigan so much that I've written many man=
y pastiches of his poetry and even begged Tim Green  to let me write a revi=
ew of The Collected Berrigan when it came out last year because I couldn't =
afford a big fucking hard cover any more than i can afford the collectors p=
rices you fucking professors have all driven his out of print books to. And=
 he published the review, which was cool, even though there were some typin=
g errors that I made and it sounded a little too soft the way the whole thi=
ng came out, but then that's how that magazine goes.

And now I'm in Manila, and I'm supposed to be writing yet another review fo=
r yet another free book only this one is by some French guy and it's for Ja=
cket, which is like a big deal for me, and yet I haven't even written it ye=
t, and I'm not even sure they want it anymore now that it's so late. And su=
re Michel DeGuy is like the second name dropped poet in this email that I'm=
 writing about Ted Berrigan, neither of whom have I met, because, y'know, o=
ne's French and the other one died when I was five.

I just realized I hadn't actually name dropped Michel DeGuy until just ther=
e, where I said I name dropped him.

I think maybe what drew me to Ted Berrigan.

No. See now any sentence that begins like that is fucking doomed.

Ted Berrigan was a big hairy fat guy. I too am a big hairy fat guy. And tha=
t gives me hope.

What's weird? Right now, because I'm in the Philippines, and it was sort of=
 a last minute trip I'm on, right now my right shoulder is sore. It's sore =
in Manila at 12:55am and would be sore 9:57am yesterday in seattle. It's so=
re because I had my shots. The shots I had to get before coming here. Shots=
 for the virus that killed Ted Berrigan. If I remember right.

I mean I know it was one of the Hepatitis's I'm sore from the innoculation =
against. And I know he died from one of the Hepatitis's. At least, I'm pret=
ty sure. He died before I was born so I really don't.

See that's a lie and an obvious device right there with the changing the ye=
ar thing. For a while I was pretty sure that I was getting away with the wh=
ole Frank O'Hara Ted Berrigan It's such and such a time thing, but probably=
 not. And definitely not this pretending I don't know how old I was when Te=
d Berrigan died. I mean. I DON'T know how old I was. But I know I'd been bo=
rn and I know I wasn't five. Or at least I'm pretty sure. Maybe I was six. =
I was born in 1978. You can google the year Ted Berrigan died and figure th=
at out for yourself.

Oh, and I'm out of cigarettes. Which should be fine because i should be qui=
tting. Except they're like 30 pesos in manila, and at 75 cents a pack it's =
hard to turn them down. Smokers will understand that sentence even if no on=
e else does.

So if this were a real Berrigan pastiche piece which maybe it is, there sho=
uld be line breaks and weird spacing. And I should be name dropping my frie=
nds who only my friends will get the name drops. Or maybe just people on th=
e list. Maybe I can sit around and wait to see if Gabe Gooding and Kent Joh=
nson dis[s?] eachother in their contributions to the thread.

Of course the cynic in me says that the guy who started the thread knows th=
at Ron Silliman and Chuck Bernstein and Jerry Rothenberg are all on this li=
st and this is his cheap ass way of trying to get them to contribute to his=
 anthology so it will sell more copies than if he and the other editor can =
say they're in it. I have this friend, a poet, Sam Cheuk. He's a chinese ca=
nadian. And he lives in New York where he's teaching undergrads how to writ=
e at NYU. And he gets drunk and arrested sometimes with Rachel McKibbens wh=
o's big on the slam scene and I like her a lot because she glued a bunch of=
 plastic jewels to a meat cleaver and mailed it to my girlfriend as a fashi=
on accessory. Even if she didn't get the tattoo on her knuckles that I sugg=
ested. Which was "Chop Chop" if you're interested, and as far as I know is =
still available. I'll even sign your hands if you ever meet me and are into=
 that kind of thing. But i'm keeping my pants on.

I'm sure there are some other famous poets on the list who i didn't mention=
=2E but fuck 'em. And fuck the guys I name dropped for that matter. I don't=
 know the guys. I mean, I like some of Ron Silliman's blog but I'm question=
ing his sanity ever since he decided that Jonathan Lethem deserved that Mac=
Arthur Grant. And Bernstein for all I know is the guy who called me out on =
the list recently for flaming Lord Patch, who's honestly probably one of th=
e better poets on the list truth be told. Excepting for all the batty polit=
ical articles he posts to the list i'd probably think he was super.

Lord Patch is super.

I'm fantastic by the way. By my book when it comes out. Read my weblog. WWW=
=2EWETASPHALT.COM

And I don't have anything against Jerome Rothenberg either. Although I wish=
 Russell Edson was on the list because him I REALLY like. Although maybe he=
's dead. Or maybe he doesn't have email and still sends out mimeographs of =
his handwritten foolscap to the people who put his books out. or maybe he i=
s on the list and just lurks. I like the idea that Russell Edson lurks.

Robin Hamilton is my favorite lister, by the way, off the top of my head, a=
lthough for a long time I thought he was a fifty year old american woman. a=
nd now I think that he's Steve Dalachinsky's age and English and a Man.

That's the internet. It's sometimes hard to tell who's a Man.

I think Ted Berrigan would have liked that about email lists.

And email lists in general.

Because I'm pretty sure he liked mail.

He wrote about it in Today in Ann Arbor.

I hope I live long enough to find out what the second half of that poem is.

George was asking about the actual manuscript, which is what Eric is
trying to find, not an edition. Are you talking about a facsimile edition?

I still don't get it. You mean that whoever owns the manuscript will
allow you to touch it? To put it on a scanner? Who are these people?

no -- it is the four seasons edition; since it was printed before 1923, it

If, as an editor/publishing house, you are going to use the original
manuscript to make an 'authoritative' edition, you will need permission to
the holding library to use their resources to make a scan. The library will
be credited as the source.

Mss. owners come into depending on copyright ownership determination. I
don't think a library can claim copyright on the manuscripts in their
archives if the work has been previously printed and copyright once - even
if ceased - established.
However if the library has that unpublished Shakespeare sonnet - you do pay,
probably big-time, for permission.

Google is trying to interfere with all this - scanning everything(with a
Library's permission) and presuming copyright and publishing control unless
questioned.

Patricia Spears Jones & Dara Wier
=20
Patricia Spears Jones=B9 new collection of poems, Femme du Monde, was
published this past spring by Tia Chucha Press. Jones has been involved in
the downtown poetry and theater scenes in NYC since the mid-1970s, working

University of Massachusetts in Amherst.
=20
=20
WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 27, 8PM
Victor Hern=E1ndez Cruz & Quincy Troupe
=20
Victor Hern=E1ndez Cruz was born in Puerto Rico and grew up in New York City
in the 50's and 60's where he started writing and was part of the Lower Eas=
t
Side=B9s fertile artistic community. He currently makes his home between his
native Puerto Rico and Morocco. His latest book of poems is The Mountain in
the Sea published by Coffee House Press. Quincy Troupe=B9s  eighth book of
poems, The Architecture of Language, will be published by Coffee House Pres=
s
this fall. In addition to chronicling his friendship with Miles Davis in
Miles and Me, Troupe has recently published children=B9s books on Magic
Johnson and Stevie Wonder.


Dara Wier

Camels of the Vieux Carre

I view you as one who should slipslap out of a grease trap
For the sake of turning a hairpin back over our tuning fork
That we stand near when we need to locate you, locating
You is what we do now with ramifications of exquisite
Pleasures such as watching words fly into dead microphones
With our lungs dry and your tongue tipped in our battlefields
Where you left us holding our hats out catching your bullets
Free with no use for not even a threadbare catchy old overcoat
For the freedom of seeing your backbones unlittered for eons
As the case may be we are intrusions in an industry of fishtanks
On the high plains with much interplay among us and firewood
As it waits for its next transformation which will come soon
For the night is chilly and the ghosts know precisely where
To find us as they prepare to serenade us as you once had done.


Patricia Spears Jones

What the First Cities were All About


Cylinder seal/lapis lazuli

Yes, all blue, all the time

beer drinking Mesopotamians

dancing to the music made on the bull-headed lyre

=20

The best in time best in show

best to know that partying is ancient,

Inexorable and A LOT OF FUN

=20

But where is that bull-head liar?

With whom is he flirting?

And what is she wearing, breasts perfumed

Gleaming curls, black eyes encircled by kohl?

=20

And how did the pig become THE NEW BULL?

Or is he THE NEW DOG, canine, Roman,

that other world, not as old, but just as festive--

togas, pendants, wine and moon madness.

=20

Where is Catullus=B9 napkin?

Was it blue?
=20

Quincy Troupe

The Signatures of Time

binding signatures of time are fading footprints
tracking across wind-blown desert floors,

newspapers whipping down cold, empty streets,
split apart, become wings sailing like stingrays
swimming through wash of an emerald sea,

history is moments gleaned from unsorted stacks
holding facts, voices steamed clean as mussels
on a plate, disintegrating on worn tapes,
splintering on spools in old tape recorders,

like photos fading out in yellowing newspapers

The Four Seasons edition is not the manuscript.
The manuscript (manu--hand; script--writing) is the writing by Dr
Williams on the paper
that he originally wrote the poem on.
The Four Season edition was a printed book. The press was a sort of
vanity press
(and to be blessed for publishing Mourning Dove's novel).
When Eric asked for help in locating WCW's manuscript, he was asking
whether
anyone here knows where WCW's original enditing of the book is held.

I am proud to announce the publication of Outspoken - How to Improve
Writing and Speaking Skills Through Poetry Performance. By Sara
Holbrook and Michael Salinger

This book contains writing and performance exercises for use in the
middle, high school and college classrooms ( the exercises and prompts
scaffold well to the abilities of the group) and also contains a DVD
that chronicles our work with the youth slam team at Cleveland's Playhouse
Square.

We just received our author's copies and the book looks great!

http://books.heinemann.com/products/E00965.aspx

Time to get work on the next one now,

Salinger

Seismosis by John Keene + Christopher Stackhouse
with a Foreword by Ed Roberson + an Afterword by Geoffrey Jacques
$19 / ISBN: 0977935108


Featuring line-drawings by Stackhouse & poems-as-essays by Keene=97handed b=
ack
and forth and back again, written and rewritten, drawn and
redrawn=97Seismosispenetrates the common ground between
writing/literature and drawing/visual
art, creating a revisioned landscape where much of the work is abstract, or
abstracted, or both.

The multiform agreements the texts & the drawings make, from a brilliant &
decisive center, are revolutionary, antilinear, and highly responsive. The
result is a sophisticated call-and-response affair. A pioneering event
between two African-American artists, Seismosis is a formal experience.


John Keene is a former member of the Dark Room Writers Collective, a
graduate fellow of Cave Canem, and recipient of many awards and
fellowships=97including a 2003 Poetry Fellowship from the New Jersey State
Council on the Arts and a 2005 Mrs. Giles Whiting Foundation Prize for
fiction. Keene is the author of the acclaimed experimental novel,
Annotations, from New Directions.

Christopher Stackhouse is the author of Slip (Corollary Press), a Cave Cane=
m
graduate fellow, a poetry editor at Fence magazine, and a New York
Foundation for the Arts Fellow in Poetry for 2005. An MFA candidate at Bard
College, Stackhouse is also an exhibiting artist whose canvases and works o=
n
paper have appeared in several New York City galleries.


To schedule an event with John Keene + Christopher Stackhouse, please
contact 1913 Press:

Advance Praises for Seismosis :

It's what happens when writing and drawing give each other a hand, a free
hand, to shake it up, to go the distance from crossing out to crossing over=
,
from ear to here and back again, fast. A little nerve music for the time
being=97sampling seismo for the pleisto scene.
=97David Levi Strauss

... Seismosis is the complete text for the course, replete with
illustrations, examples, graphs, exercises, and tests.
=97from the Foreword by Ed Roberson

This exquisite collaboration goes beyond a linear mutual appreciation: poet
likes artist's work=97artist likes poet's work. In Seismosis, Keene &
Stackhouse present an interwoven, intersecting conversation between one
another and their art forms. We read the poems and see the drawings=97we re=
ad
the drawings and see the poems, as the collaborators make use of space,
line, and textural performance in one multimedia framework. Here, two men's
boyish charms and haunting playfulness create a three-dimensional canvas ou=
t
of thinking inscriptions.
=97Tracie Morris

Wow. Rarely a book makes such an impact. Keene and Stackhouse heat up the
strange place where abstraction becomes as visceral as thoughts or
conversations. Anyone interested in artistic collaborations will rarely fin=
d
one this complete, in the pleasure of ever-forming and dissolving boundarie=
s
between gestures. An immediate delight.

an evening of poetry w/ kathy engel + gale jackson + marc zegans

Kathy Engel has been a full-time
advocate/organizer/consultant/producer/writer engaged in building
social justice, human rights and peace organizations and campaigns. She
has worked extensively as a bridge between organizations and
individuals who may not ordinarily work together or engage in dialogue
with the purpose of building multi-racial/cross-class progressive
institutions and projects, and maximizing the effectiveness and
creativity of progressive efforts. Her work is based on a commitment to
breaking boundaries, and infusing the imagination and thinking of the
artist and the intellectual into the strategic planning for grassroots,
community, national and international media and organizing efforts.

Gale Jackson will be reading from the brand new books MeDea (Glad Day
Press) and Suite for Mozambique (Ikon). She is a poet, writer,
librarian and cultural historian. She is the author of MeDea, Suite for
Mozambique, Bridge Suite: Narrative Poems, A Khoisan Tale of Beginnings
and Ends, and We Stand Our Ground with Kimiko Hahn and Susan Sherman.
She currently serves on the faculty of Goddard College, as poet in
residence at The Secondary School for Journalism and as storyteller in
residence at The Hayground School.

Marc Zegans is a poet, playwright and author. His current work explores
waking dreams and the experience of human fragility in the
post-industrial landscape. He is now completing a book that explores
these themes, entitled, Poems of Danger and Abandon. He is also
developing a spoken work album for Philistine Records. As a non-fiction
writer Marc has written extensively about innovation in the public
sector, and philanthropic practice. He is currently completing a book

  Patti Smith rails against Israel and US
By Louise Jury, Arts Correspondent
Published: 09 September 2006

The singer-songwriter Patti Smith has produced an emotional indictment
of American and Israeli foreign policy in two new protest songs she will
premiere in London next week.

The American singer takes the Israeli bombing of Lebanese civilians and
the US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay and as her subjects in the
songs "Qana" and "Without Chains".

She condemned an Israeli air strike on the Lebanese village of Qana in
July as "an atrocity" for which America was partly to blame. At least 56
people were killed, including 32 children.

Smith said she was further ashamed of America for its detention of young
men in Guantanamo Bay. "I wrote both these songs directly in response to
events that I felt outraged about," she said. "These are injustices
against children and the young men and women who are being incarcerated.
I'm an American, I pay taxes in my name and they are giving millions and
millions of dollars to a country such as Israel and cluster bombs and
defence technology and those bombs were dropped on common citizens in
Qana. It's terrible. It's a human rights violation."

Smith said she was not sufficiently well versed in Middle East politics
to discuss the differences between Israel and Lebanon. "But there was no
righteousness attached to destroying the infrastructure of this country
that had been rebuilding. It's an atrocity not only against the people
but against the land. I find it really unforgivable."

In the second song, "Without Chains", she details the story of Murat
Kurnaz, who was finally released from Guantanamo on 24 August after four
years. Kurnaz, a Turkish citizen who was born and raised in Germany, was
in the process of becoming a German citizen when he was arrested in
Pakistan in late 2001.

Smith said: "He is the same age as my son, Jackson. When I read the
story, I realised how I would feel as a mother if my son had been taken
away at the age of 20, put into chains, without any hope of leaving,
without any direct charge."

She will perform the songs on Monday and Tuesday at the South Bank
Centre where she was the guest director of last year's Meltdown Festival.

As part of that, she was partnered by Kevin Shields, the ex-guitarist of
My Bloody Valentines, on "The Coral Sea", a prose lament to the artist
Robert Mapplethorpe, a former boyfriend, who died of Aids.

Mindlessfullness | Trepan 6 (http://trepan.org)

According to linguistics, language is material. Words are things made of
sound and a poem is a machine made out of words. To write is to knead
language into a shape, much like laying out dough and waiting for it to
rise. These poems, these machines are not necessarily made to spit out idea=
s
and meaning simply because someone's eye is running across a page or a
screen. And would it be so bad to remark after having read something, "This
object was not made by an artist, but by a machine, by a process"?

This is a call to open the cultural database, let everyone use the
technology of textual production to its maximum potential, whether it be th=
e
technology inscribed on silicon or the kind that can be implemented on
paper, or whether the results are intended for the age-old tecnology of the
printed page or for the somehwat newer, screen. Rather than being led by
sequences of signs, instead drift through them. This is the project of
unchaining the codes=97not the subject anymore=97so that something will bur=
st
out, will escape; words beneath words. Another kind of word is born and the
language you are breathing becomes the language you think=85 these are not
mere metaphors but a call for new procedures of writing.

This writing turns in on itself, sacrifices itself, in order to establish a
space of possibility beyond itself, to make as visible as possible the
limits & norms & operations of the machinery, to appropriate the machinery
of discourse in order to put it to other as yet forbidden or unimagined
uses, and in the end hopefully to show the possibilities of sense & meaning
being constructed; to foreground the limits of the possible=97& our possibl=
e
lives; to create impossibility.

After Trepan's last issue, "Monstrous." we turn to investigate the life of
the mind in Trepan 6, "Mindlessfullness." The processes we create, the tool=
s
we use and their products have the ability to express the predilection for
the mind in art, possibly more perfectly than writing that comes straight
from inspiration, straight from the mind to the page. Language itself is
surely a technology insofar as it is a tool made by people; our tools and
technologies are not dumb and lifeless externalities that we pick up at nee=
d
to do a job; instead, they often are truly extensions of ourselves:
extensions of our minds and feelings and imaginations.

Mindlessfullness will exhibit the writer in repose. After creating an
unspeakably complex or diabolically simple process the writer has the
ability to release his/her mind and allow their machine to work like a
trepan burrowing into our brains to see what we have there. Just as this
call for work is itself a machinic work of plaigiarism.

Trepan cultivates mutation in forms and styles of reading and writing,
discarding traditional barriers between genres and forms, seeking out
unexpected openings, and creating them where necessary.

Trepan was founded and edited by the MFA students of the CalArts Writing
Program, who published the first four volumes. Trepan is now produced by
Superbunker (superbunker.com) as an independent journal focusing on
experimental and hybrid arts. Each volume will have a unique theme and
editorial staff, managed by series editor Jason Brown, Trepan 5 and Trepan =
6
guest edited by Mathew Timmons. Send submissions by Jan 1, 2007 to
editors@trepan.edu.

Mark Ford - I believe I got the right name - has what I think is a pretty
good review of Harry Mathew's CIA book, and Ouilipo books and history (the
conflation of the two contexts) in the current NY R of Books. Ford is
obviously simultaneously writing an Intro to Ouilipo - origins, etc.   It
might all seem Mandarin and privileged - where the food is refined as the
composition of vowels -  but it ain't dumb.

Parenthetically, it was kind of odd in the way the Andy Warhol documentary
ended up seeming to be a Horatio Alger morality tale - the dangers of going
off the deep end followed by lucrative redemption and solid recognition
through hard work and good business practices (and keeping the freaks whose
imaginations fed the early work a long way from your studio door.)

Comparatively, I think Ginsberg and Whitman remained socially porous to the
end.

Hi Alan

Thought you might like to know of this--maybe you shd write something abt
math & poetry. Are you still willing to read a chapter of Mom's book on math
as an art form? I'm packing it up bec I'm moving to 18 Lexington Ave,
Cambridge, MA 02138 in a month--haven't sold this house yet but will move
then anyway, as soon as renovation is complete.
Happy new year to all,
Ruth
The Jewish National Fund show of Mom's sculptures raised $70,000 for
Israel--Mom wd have been thrilled.

This week, a review of Artaud's Jet of Blood -

...Artaud envisioned a theatre was, at its core, religious: what he
sought was an experience which, like the "chemical marriage" of the
Alchemists, would resolve his warring dualities into a coherent whole.
Sontag is correct when she points to the extremity of his "moral
rigour", commenting that Oliver Cromwell and Girolamo Savanarola might
well have approved the theatre he proposed.

Certainly, Artaud shares with figures like Osama bin Laden or Pol Pot
a singular and apocalyptic moral vision that seeks purification
through destruction and violence. It is not hard to imagine Artaud
following Stockhausen, who in a widely reviled remark shortly after
the 9/11 attacks, called the destruction of the Twin Towers "the
greatest work of art there has ever been!" "I am not a madman," Artaud
said, late in his life. "I am a fanatic." Like all Artaud's
self-diagnoses, this statement has the cold coruscation of truth.

What, then, to make of competing claims for an "authentic" experience
of Artaud? Outside a lunatic asylum, a war zone or a concentration
camp, I am not sure whether there can be such a thing. It is possible
to think of the theatrics of torture in Abu Ghraib - the posing for
photographs, the obliterating of the human body, the totalising word,
the sexual loathing - as the ultimate Artaudian theatre. Like many
poets, Artaud was lamentably literal.

I can't think of anyone who has taken Artaud's ideas in toto and
realised them in the theatre; and in my heart, I can't imagine why
anyone would want to. He is a catalyst and a provocation, rather than
a model. Grotowski's actor-centred quest for sacred truth or Brook's
aesthetic sensuousness are far too humane to be genuinely Artaudian.
Making Artaud is, in many ways, also an unmaking of Artaud.

creation of a modern underworld beneath London, the city's =20
subterranean labyrinth of sewage, transit, and communications =20
systems. This conference will consider the rich representational =20
history this urban underworld has enjoyed, in literature, music, film =20=

and art, over the past 175 years. Socially conceived underworlds of =20
poverty of crime that proliferate in the wake of the city's rapid =20
expansion and industrialisation will receive special attention. So =20
too will the numerous underground movements, both cultural and =20
intellectual, to emerge in the capital since the death of William =20
Blake in 1827 (most notably in the 1960s, with publications such as =20
'New Departures' and 'International Times'). This conference will =20
attempt to map these spatial, social and cultural undergrounds; to =20
relate London's most richly suggestive mindscape to contemporary =20
theoretical debates on subterranean space, urban studies, and =20
subcultural activity.

We are delighted to announce an evening celebration of the Urban =20
Underworld to follow the conference at the Bateman Auditorium, =20
Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, 8-11pm. This special =20
=91happening=92 will feature poetry by Michael Horovitz and Ian =20
Patterson, live music from improv jazz quartet Barkingside and films =20
by Rod Mengham and Marc Atkins.

Tickets for the Conference cost =A312 / =A310 conc.
Tickets for the Evening Event cost =A36 / =A35 conc.
Tickets for both Conference & Event cost =A315 / =A312 conc.

To purchase advance tickets for either event or both, please send a =20

Dear Steve, I hope you got the poem I wrote for your birthday party and read.  That was what was in the envelope I gave you, not a check, as you suggested.  As if I would ever have the money to give you some!  I don't even have a checking account so I was stunned.  Anyway, I hope you got the poem and liked it.  Regards, Tom Savage

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present a reading by

Jules Boykoff & Judith Goldman

Friday, September 29, 2006 at 7:30 p.m.

Jules Boykoff joins us in honor of his first collection, Once Upon a
Neoliberal Rocket Badge (Edge Books). Tina Darragh says of reading it: “I want
to echo Tom Hayden's comment on the 1999 Seattle anti-WTO demonstrations: ‘I
am glad to have lived long enough to see a new generation of rebels accomplish
something bigger.’ Boykoff's inventive language reminds us that in the futures
market we're all dressed in sheep's clothing. This book re-girds us for the
fight.”


Judith Goldman joins us in honor of her new book, Death Star Rico-chet (O
Books). Rod Smith says: “In this violent and deeply accusatory book the cause
and the effect are the restoration of our historical context as crime. The
crime being murder. Deathstar/Ricohcet: The canceled check of a civilization.
Somehow I don’t think that Pound thought his investment in poetry as ‘news
that stays new’ would be returned for lack of funds. The implications of
Goldman’s work are immense.”

again at b&n 48th street & 5th avenue, manhattan (and
this one has to be somebody's deliberate drollery,
right?):

1 copy of _The Devil's Guide to Hollywood: The
Screenwriter as God_, by "Hollywood bad-boy
screenwriter Joe Esterhaz" in the *religion* section.

(Not far from where I found, as I checked out what I
had previously reported, that there are *still* 3
copies of Charles Bernstein's _The Sophist_ in the
Philosophy section.  Then again, I bet C.B. has never
called up to complain: to be in the Philosophy section
I guess is like being at the ultimate Grown-Up's
Table...far from them Adolescents...)

But speaking of Religion, could David-Baptiste Chirot

Nevermind that the whole is predicated on the highly dubious proposition that we can all choose what we believe, to which, if you believe that, I invite you to believe that you are a bonobo and see how far you get.

Would anyone be so kind as to send along the text of this poem offlist?

I believe it's in the collection Cultural Affairs in Boston (Black
Sparrow, 1988) ... ordered this over a month ago from a 3rd party on
Amazon & it's never shown up.

I think it might also be in The Goliard Press's 1973 Selected Poems.

I need it (asap) for an essay I'm writing and don't want to cite from
memory.

Thanks--any help would be super appreciated.

Robert

ps. Also, I'm looking to buy an old copy of the Goliard book if anyone's
selling!

Sorry to waste another post on this, but I think my earlier info. was a
bit off: Grossman (NYC) did the old Wieners Selected Poems, I think, and
1972, not 73.  Still wouldn't mind picking one of these up, though.

The Typing Explosion: In the summer of 1998, three young =

women boarded Seattle city buses, lugging old electric =

typewriters, slightly uncomfortable in their pantyhose and =

looking like they'd stepped straight out of the typing pool =

in 1965. Rachel Kessler, Sarah Paul Ocampo, and Sierra =

Nelson set up their three typewriters on caf=E9 tables during =

a busy gallery opening, posted Rules of Conduct and Rules =

for Participation, and waited for someone to approach them. =

Within minutes, a line of people trailed down the sidewalk, =

craning their necks to watch the prim-looking secretaries =

type instant poetry like furious robots. Since that day, The =

Typing Explosion has performed countless times up and down =

the West coast of the U.S., as well as New York City, =

receiving both national and international recognition. Part =

performance art and part poetry assembly line, The Typing =

Explosion's poetry-performance type-ins defy categorization. =

Typing Explosion's notoriety reached international =

proportions with feature articles in USA Today, The =

Washington Post, San Jose Mercury, Seattle Times, Seattle P-
I; Jane, S=
pin, BUST, Allure, Sunset, and Resonance =

Magazines; and interviews on Studio 360 New York, KUOW =

American National Public Radio, and Canadian National =

Radio.  On hiatus since 2004, the Typing Explosion reunited =

in the summer of 2006 in anticipation of the Wave Books =

Poetry Bus Tour. =

(Please excuse any cross-posting)


On this already past Monday, September 25, Ron Silliman - at his blogspo  -
has given Beverly Dahlen's works a substantial review, including generous
excerpts from several of her books over the past 35 years.
http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/
The occasion of Ron's review is the Instance Press (Elizabeth Robinson et
al) new publication of,  A Reading 18 -20. (Which only takes "A Reading" up
to 1986!). Among much, #18 has a nice 'head to head' response to Barry
Watten's "The XYZ of Reading: Negativity (& Diane Ward)", was being much
discussed at the time. A Reading 18 -20 is available through Small Book
Distribution (Berkeley, CA).
I won't go further on at this time to make my own reflections on the Beverly
Dahlen's new book, but, for those on this list with interest, as once
publisher of Momo's Press, I still  have some available copies of A Reading
1 - 7. (Published in 1986).

$20 will bring you the book, handling and postage included, no matter where
you are in the world. If interested, please your check out and send  order
to:

Stephen Vincent
3514 21st Street
SF CA  94114

I also have a very few copies of her first book, signed, Out of The Third,
published in 1974. Email me if you have interest.

CHAX Press has also printed a section of A Reading (as well as a series of
her poems on Spicer; (either go to the CHAX website, or SBD for ordering
info); another chunk of A Reading is published by Potes and Poets - though I
do not know if that is print or accessible.

Thanks,

Charles Alexander, also, has a nice extended and different kind of take
Dahlen's A Reading 18 - 20. Interesting C's take on the way shadows play
into and against the work, absence and presence, and where the 'word'
manages to name and/or gets erased.

It would be interesting to see Rachel Blau DuPlessis' take on Beverly's
work. I know the two were in close correspondence for years and critically
important to each other's 'long' works.

Once the last quarter of the century is further and variously crystalized
(in correspondences, etc.), I suspect the letters of Rachel and Beverly will
be seriously engaged in terms of an experimental feminist poetics that was
related to and responsive to Language Poetries (including the various
theoretical influences), but an independent force, thread and configuration
of its own particularities. Course a bunch of that conversation and concern
goes on in A - Reading, including letters and quotes.

Subject: Re R Silliman Review of Works of Beverly Dahlen

(Please excuse any cross-posting)


On this already past Monday, September 25, Ron Silliman - at his blogspo  -
has given Beverly Dahlen's works a substantial review, including generous
excerpts from several of her books over the past 35 years.
http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/
The occasion of Ron's review is the Instance Press (Elizabeth Robinson et
al) new publication of,  A Reading 18 -20. (Which only takes "A Reading" up
to 1986!). Among much, #18 has a nice 'head to head' response to Barry
Watten's "The XYZ of Reading: Negativity (& Diane Ward)", was being much
discussed at the time. A Reading 18 -20 is available through Small Book
Distribution (Berkeley, CA).
I won't go further on at this time to make my own reflections on the Beverly
Dahlen's new book, but, for those on this list with interest, as once
publisher of Momo's Press, I still  have some available copies of A Reading
1 - 7. (Published in 1986).

$20 will bring you the book, handling and postage included, no matter where
you are in the world. If interested, please your check out and send  order
to:

Stephen Vincent
3514 21st Street
SF CA  94114

I also have a very few copies of her first book, signed, Out of The Third,
published in 1974. Email me if you have interest.

CHAX Press has also printed a section of A Reading (as well as a series of
her poems on Spicer; (either go to the CHAX website, or SBD for ordering
info); another chunk of A Reading is published by Potes and Poets - though I
do not know if that is print or accessible.

Thanks,

I think the term heresy could be used in several senses.  In the sense
in which I used it, Church history
contains a wide variety of configurations between heretics and the
main church -- in the cases
I recall, Eckhart, Luther, Hadjewich, the author did not set out to
undermine the church but to create a new
land.  I used the term "heresy" in this sense, to mean specifically
theological heresy, which entails
certain things with regards to the theology of what one is a heretic
from.  The following is a long
letter from Luther to the Pope which refers to numerous arcane
sqabbles of the time, irrelevant now,
but the point is that Luther considered himself in a kind of
membership in the Church when he posted
his heresies on the door at Wittenberg.  If one is going to run off
the reservation, this seems to me
to be a good model.

                        Accompanying the "Resolutions"

                            by Dr. Martin Luther,

        LETTER TO POPE LEO X, ACCOMPANYING
        THE "RESOLUTIONS" TO THE XCV THESES


        1518

        To the


        Most Blessed Father,

        LEO X.

        Martin Luther,

        Augustinian Friar,


        wisheth everlasting welfare.

        I have heard evil reports about myself, most blessed Father,
        by which I know that certain friends have put my name in very
        bad odor with you and yours, saying that I have attempted to


        belittle the power of the keys and of the Supreme Pontiff.
        Therefore I am accused of heresy, apostasy, and perfidy, and
        am called by six hundred other names of ignominy. My ears


        I put my confidence remains unshaken -- my clear and quiet
        conscience. Moreover, what I hear is nothing new. With such

        those same honorable and truthful men,
i.e., by the men whose
        own conscience convicts them of wrongdoing, and who are trying

        their own shame by bringing shame to me. But you will deign,

        blessed Father, to hear the true case from me, though I am but


        It is not long ago that the preaching of the Jubilee
        indulgences was begun in our country, and matters went so far

        that the preachers of indulgences, thinking that the

        protection of your name made anything permissible, ventured
        openly to teach the most impious and heretical doctrines,
        which threatened to make the power of the Church a scandal and

        a laughing-stock, as if the decretals De abusionibus
        quaestorum did not apply to them.

        Not content with spreading this poison of theirs by word of
        mouth, they published tracts and scattered them among the


        people. In these books -- to say nothing of the insatiable and
        unheard of avarice of which almost every letter in them vilely
        smells -- they laid down those same impious and heretical


        were bound by their oath to be faithful and insistent in
        urging them upon the people. I speak the truth, and none of
        them can hide himself from the heat thereof. The tracts are

        extant and they cannot disown them. These teachings were so
        successfully carried on, and the people, with their false
        hopes, were sucked so dry that, as the Prophet says, "they

        meanwhile were fed most pleasantly on the fat of the land.

        There was just one means which they used to quiet opposition,

        to wit, the protection of your name, the threat of burning at

        the stake, and the disgrace of the name "heretic." It is
        incredible how ready they are to threaten, even, at times,

        when they perceive that it is only their own mere silly

        opinions which are contradicted. As though this were to quiet
        opposition, and not rather to arouse schisms and seditions by
        sheer tyranny!


        None the less, however, stories about the avarice of the

        priests were bruited in the taverns, and evil was spoken of
        the power of the keys and of the Supreme Pontiff, and as

        evidence of this, I could cite the common talk of this whole

        as I thought, or with the heat of youth, if you prefer to have

        it so; and yet I saw that it was not in place for me to make

        any decrees or to do anything in these matters. Therefore I
        privately admonished some of the prelates of the Church. By

        ridiculous, to still others something worse; for the terror of

        your name and the threat of Church censures prevailed. At
        last, since I could do nothing else, it seemed good that I

        should offer at least a gentle resistance to them, i.e.,
        question and discuss their teachings. Therefore I published a

        set of theses, inviting only the more learned to dispute with

        adversaries, from the Preface to the Disputation.

        Lo, this is the fire with which they complain that all the

        world is now ablaze! Perhaps it is because they are indignant

        that I, who by your own apostolic authority am a Master of
        Theology, have the right to conduct public disputations,

        whole Church, not only about indulgences, but also about God's

        power and remission and mercy, which are incomparably greater

        envy me the privilege granted me by the power of your
        Holiness, since I am unwillingly compelled to yield to them in

        things of far greater moment, viz., when they mix the dreams

        of Aristotle with theological matters, and conduct nonsensical
        disputations about the majesty of God, beyond and against the

        privilege granted them.

        It is a miracle to me by what fate it has come about that this

        single Disputation of mine should, more than any other, of
        mine or of any of the teachers, have gone out into very nearly

        the whole land. It was made public at our University and for

        our University only, and it was made public in such wise that
        I cannot believe it has become known to all men. For it is a

        according to custom, in an obscure and enigmatic way.

        should have taken care, for my part, that they would be easier

        to understand.

        Now what shall I do? I cannot recant them; and yet I see that

        marvelous enmity is inflamed against me because of their
        dissemination. It is unwillingly that I incur the public and

        perilous and various judgment of men, especially since I am

        in this brilliant age of ours, which by its achievements in

        though he was no base follower of the public light. But
        necessity compels me to be the goose that squawks among the

        swans.


        And so, to soften my enemies and to fulfil the desires of
        many, I herewith send forth these trifling explanations of my
        Disputation; I send them forth in order, too, that I may be


        more safe under the defense of your name and the shadow of
        your protection. In them all may see, who will, how purely and
        simply I have sought after and cherished the power of the


        unjustly and falsely my adversaries have befouled me with so
        many names. For if I had been such a one as they wish to make

        me out, and if I had not, on the contrary, done everything

        Illustrious Prince Frederick, Duke of Saxony, Imperial
        Elector, etc., would never have tolerated such a pest in his
        University, for he most dearly loves the Catholic and


        Apostolic truth, nor could I have been tolerated by the keen
        and learned men of our University. But what has been done, I
        do because those most courteous men do not fear openly to


        disgrace with myself.

        Wherefore, most blessed Father, I cast myself at the feet of
        your Holiness, with all that I have and all that I am.

        Quicken, kill, call, recall, approve, reprove, as you will. In

        your voice I shall recognize the voice of Christ directing you
        and speaking in you. If I have deserved death, I shall not

        refuse to die. For the earth is the Lord's and the fulness


        May He have you too forever in His keeping. Amen.

Hi--

Can anyone help?  I need to find a copy of Philip Levine's poem "A Walk With
Thomas Jefferson" -- at least I think that's the title.  I don't have it,
and sadly, I've been unable to scare this up through Interlibrary Loan.  All
I need is the text of the poem;  in the end, I'll be happy with a citation
for a book that is in print.  The 1984 Selected Poems doesn't have it.

Please write me off list if you can help--

Thanks--

Joel K.

Maya Stendhal Gallery proudly announces the upcoming exhibition
George Maciunas 1953-1978, Charts, Diagrams, Films, Documents, and
Atlases.

The works on view are Atlas of Russian History, Prehistoric Chinese
Art (Shang and Chou Dynasties), European and Siberian Art of
Migration, Biography Chronicling Activity between 1939-1978, and
Diagram of Historical Development of Fluxus (incomplete). Created
between 1953 and 1978, these "cultural timetables" reveal Maciunas'
interest in visually displaying diverse information about historical
periods. Maciunas' charts, diagrams, and atlases make clear his
desire to record artistic and sociopolitical chronological evolution.
With these charts, he introduced the 20th century as the era of "Art
Genealogy"

Born to a Russian mother and Lithuanian father, Maciunas was an
artist, art historian, designer, architect, editor, producer,
genealogist, typographer, mathematician, musicologist, and leader of
the 1960's international Fluxus movement. Influenced by Marcel
Duchamp's use of art beyond painting and John Cage's experimental
music, Fluxus deviated between the boundaries of art and non-art
through Maciunas' vision of artistic collaboration in various
mediums. He combined music, performance, visual arts, and literature
to create one of the most influential philosophies and artistic
movements in modern art of the 20th century.

Maciunas did not spontaneously design his works, but rather preceded
them with eleven years of intensive studies at Cooper Union School of
Art, the Carnegie Institute of Technology and New York University.
His widespread interests and universalistic approach required a
suitable form of knowledge management in order for him to retain an
overview of the enormity of the material. Charts, diagrams, and
atlases allowed him to reduce complexities, define limits, and make
connections between data. Maciunas made some three dozen of these
historical diagrams between 1953 and 1978 which not only made clear
political, economic, poetic, and aesthetic relationships, but also
predetermined the geo-historical framework of Fluxus.

Maciunas believed that the evolution of art could not be understood
without an orientation of a particular subject in context of time and
space. In 1969, he developed his theory of the "Learning Machine"
which called for improvements in methods of transmitting information.
Maciunas criticized the rigid, linear-narratives of books, lectures,
or other traditional forms of learning for their lack of
communication of the layers and connections within history.
Networking thoughts into timesaving and efficient charts and
diagrams, these "Learning Machines" were also artistically and
scientifically interesting.

Space and time, and their dissolution into succession, played an
important role as well. By breaking up the factual scheme, the work
was extended into the third dimension. The linear order of time is
emphasized by Maciunas' attempt to uncover the complexity of dates by
chronologically coding history. He depicts history with mathematical
precision through a theory that time runs in cycles, depicted in his
charts by a formulaic wave curve. His model of time consisted of four
phases; origin, prosperity, maturity, and decline. Within these
phases are both primary and secondary cycles of time consisting of
mathematical rules that systematize factual relationships. In
determining his time frame, Maciunas used dates and their
corresponding events to reduce history to technical means.

With these documents, Maciunas criticized the rigid, linear-
narratives of books, lectures, or other traditional forms of
accessing information. He felt that a linear series of dates did not
allow for the necessary communication of layers within history. He
therefore developed an accurate way to visually obtain knowledge and
quickly perceive themes. The dates, which make up his diagrams and
charts, take on a "Physiognomy", creating a three-dimensional
reconstructed historical space.

Whether literally or symbolically, this idea of dimensions was
communicated while also limiting specialization. In learning,
Maciunas believed it was important to specialize only gradually. A
wider range of understanding and
orientation of time, according to Maciunas, was necessary for
professional success of any specialist.

This show provides a unique opportunity to view a rare body of work
that has never before been published or exhibited. The exhibition
will run from September 28 - October 28, 2006.

Just wanted to pass along news of my new chap:

In a galloping lyric form all its own, *Instants* tells the fragmented story of a crime of passion committed by motion-obsessed Victorian photographer Eadward Muybridge, inventor of the zoopraxiscope, precursor to the filmstrip.

Handmade by members of the Ugly Duckling collective, the cover image of two naked wrestlers, folded in two, echoes Breughel's "Landscape with the Fall of Icarus" and the larger split/subject that the serial poem dramatizes.  Plus, it's a flip-book as well.

Jeff posted a link to A. C. Evans' essay, which closes with
a discussion of "alienated intellectuals." Then Ubu Web
announced, "The Sounds of Madness: Poets and Performers
Interpret Outsider Writings."

It made me wonder about "outsider writings." Is there a
counterpart to "outsider writing"?

Is there such a thing as "insider writing"?

I mean, has anyone recently written a quality poem about how
happy and adjusted they are? Do poets tout their
conventionality and sanity? Even academic poets seem to love
to give voice to unreason and alienation.

So who is "the insider"? There has to be an "insider"
otherwise the term "outsider" wouldn't mean anything.

Flummoxed as usual,
Eric

I read "Outsider Writings" as the literary aspect of "Outsider Art" -- =
the rough-hewn products of untrained, visionary, possibly mentally =
unstable folks. (Or at least folks playing at being mentally unstable... =
not that there's anything wrong with that.*)

Is that what Outsider Writing is? Or is it what people "shut out" of the =
Academy or Establishment write, aka "alienated intellectuals"? Or what =
avantissimi come up with when they make figs at the writers of 'happy & =
adjusted' poetry?=20

Oh dear, I'm buying into pigeon-holing terminology again... time for a =
warm compress.=20

Just as the Corybantes, not being in their senses [ouk emphrones], dance =

verses...

The Enterprise boldly goes gentle
  into that dark night, poly-threaded with
  hot alien babes that use "party" as

  a verb--it makes me kinda nervous
  to say so--vermin photograph ledger pages
  backwards and bending around illbient

  corners--following Reid Avenue
  killing my thighs, hellish tuning across
  blasted streetlight terrain--walking

  cleanly through the night--the notes burn
  their malicious scripts into brick, into
  dust--a million grains chattering--

  boldly lolling atop a pop-art armistice--
  laced up in a gorgeous bold gentilitY

"an outsider" may not at best have an MFA. she may live in a red state,
not register to vote.  he may have a very narrow karmic balance, and
push it. she may have heard "and shit" appended to too many sentences to
write a perfect essay.  he may be a minority, uncaring of proper nods.
she may be here.  he may be there.

is an Outsider writer required to avoid at all cost publication of his

Leonardo Electronic Almanac
New Media Poetry and Poetics Issue
Sept, v o l 14, i s s u e 05
http://www.leoalmanac.org

A cool 10 grand. That's the number of hits that electronically streamed
through  this e-journal during its virgin weekend. This was revealed by an
ecstatic LEA editor-in-chief, Nisar Keshvani, who also shares the accolades
that have been pouring in from readers. He adds, 750 man-hours have gone
into producing the "New Media Poetics and Poetry" Special guest-edited by
Tim Peterson. Of the 70 submissions, nine crisp essays and four artist
statements feature in Vol 14 No 5 – 6.

The peer-reviewed electronic journal introduces downloadable PDFs of its
essays with MLA and APA style citations and launches LEAD: Leonardo
Electronic Almanac Discussion. LEAD will engage readers in an online
moderated discussion list and real-time live chats with New Media Poetics
scholars.

Let's now, leap into yet another bold foray, this time revolving around the
world of new media poetics. Bursting at the cyber-seams, a spiffy collection
of essays by myriad authors await.

"In the new media environment, we deal with an expanded notion of "poem" as
praxis of surface level and sub-textual computer code levels, and an
expanded awareness of the digital poem as process. The reading and reception
of this writing occurs in a networked context, in which the reader becomes
an "ergodic" participant (to use Espen Aarseth's term) and helps shape the
form of the new media poem," defines New Media Poetics and Poetry issue
guest editor Tim Peterson.

*  *  *

Peterson has woven together a marvelous mix featuring

Loss Pequeño Glazier

John Cayley with Dimitri Lemmerman

Lori Emerson

Phillippe Bootz

Manuel Portela

Stephanie Strickland

Yes,

After 8 mnths of seemingly interminable idiocy,
my 7X10", 499 page book entitled "footnotes" is finally out.
"footnotes" is a massive rewrite of, excerpting from, & commentary on
my 1st 9 books:

t he book
t he referent 4 wch consists of
t he non-materialized transparent punch-outs from a letter/whatever
stencil
- 1977

Yet Another Slow-Burning Feast of a Few Months Mischief in the U.K.,
Maybe
(A Partial(ly) Epistolary Account of Non-Non & Non-Participation, Maybe)
- 1988

How to Write A Resume - Volume II: Making a Good First Impression
- 1989/90

Telepathy Receptivity Training
- 1991

Reactionary Muddle America
- 1992

A Mere Outline for One Aspect of a Book on Mystery Catalysts,
Guerrilla Playfare, neoism, booed usic, Mad Scientist Didactions,
Acts of As-Beenism, So-Called Whatevers, Psychopathfinding,
Uncerts, Air Dressing, Practicing Promotextuality, Imp Activism,
CircumSubstantial Playing, etc..

Anonymous Family Reunion

"footnotes" may very well be the most massive book I ever have
published.
Many of you are in it in some form or another (noticed any missing
body parts lately?).
If you'd like to buy a copy it can be ordered by going to this web-page:

Ignore the complete stupidity of the uninformative 'description' of
the book.
I had nothing to do w/ that.

Inclusion in the Outlaw Bible of American Poetry, I think.

Which is why in order to call myself an outsider poet I sometimes introduce myself to strangers as Allen Ginsberg. i want to call myself an outsider poet because it sounds cool.

New York, NY – Arts for Art proudly kicks off its fall 2006 season of the
Vision Club with two nights amazing avantjazz.

On Friday, October 6 we will present a powerhouse duo: saxophonist Peter
Brotzmann and drummer Han Bennink.  The two free music masters
have a long history, first in Brotzmann’s large projects, notably the
1968 “Machine Gun.”  A trio with Belgian pianist Fred Van Hove grew out
of these collaborations.  But in 1976 the two free music masters began
work as a duo releasing a series of recordings, concluding with 1980’s
“Atsugi Concert.”  They weren’t heard from again “on wax” until Brotzmann
booked a series of performances in early 2004 with the explicit intention
of capturing the performances for later release.  The result, “Still
Popular After All Those Years” was issued on vinyl on Brotzmann’s own
resurrected BRO label later that same year.

On Saturday, October 7 we present the premier performance of the unique
collective, featuring an irresistible combination of avantJazz masters:
Marshall Allen (alto sax & E.V.I. - Electronic Valve Instrument), William
Parker (bass, donson ghoni and double reeds), and the
multi-instrumentalist Cooper Moore (percussion).  The second set will be
the same group with the addition of special guest, premier trumpet player
Roy Campbell.   With such a surprising
collective of versatile artists, we can only hope that this will  be the
first of many performances.

Brotzmann / Bennink Press
"Peter Brotzmann has exemplified European improvised music for over 40
years.” - All About Jazz
“What makes Bennink special is his manifest love for the music, a love
that inclines him to tear down the cardboard walls that too often
separate different schools of jazz.”– Drummer World

Allen / Parker / Moore / Campbell Press
“...Marshall Allen is one of the most distinguished altoists of his
generation.” - Clifford Allen, All About Jazz

"(William Parker is) the most consistently brilliant free jazz bassist of
all time." - The Village Voice

"Cooper-Moore is the sort of artist that oozes music. Whether on piano,
drum heads or instruments of his own devise, or even just screaming and
hollering the blues, he is consistently captivating and inventive.” Kurt
Gottschalk

"Roy Campbell, Jr. [is] an inventive trumpeter whose playing has a
stream-of consciousness logic and an unassumingly rich and confident
sound."
Gary Giddins, The Village Voice

*About Palm Press*

Palm Press is an independent press located in Long Beach, California. Our
mission is to make available works which navigate the interstices, the
between spaces, of discourse. We aim to further an interrogation of these
gaps by publishing writers whose work challenges notions of genre and by
focusing on writers who consciously work within and among these spaces in
poetry, essay, cultural studies, narrativity, theory and the increasingly
blurred edge between such categories.


*Performer Bios*

**David Buuck lives in Oakland, California. Recent chapbooks include RUTS
from TaxtPress & RUNTS from Self-punish or parrot, plus an untitled
forthcoming essay from Palm Press (2007).

**Mair=E9ad Byrne immigrated to the United States from Ireland in 1994 for
reasons of poetry. She is the author of An Educated Heart (Palm Press,
2005), Vivas (Wild Honey Press, 2005), and Nelson & The Huruburu Bird (Wild
Honey Press, 2003). She lives with her two daughters in Providence, Rhode
Island, where she teaches poetry at the Rhode Island School of Design.

**Wendy S. Walters is author of Birds of Los Angeles (Palm Press, 2005). Sh=
e
is Assistant Professor of English at the Rhode Island School of Design
(RISD). Recent poems have been published in Seneca Review, The Yalobusha
Review, Sou=B9wester, Spinning Jenny, Nocturnes (Re)view, and Callaloo. Her
work has received support from RISD, the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust=
,
the Smithsonian Institution, the Ford Foundation, and the Aaron Copland
Foundation, and she has participated in residencies at The MacDowell Colony=
,
Cave Canem, and Yaddo.

**Matvei Yankelevich is author of The Present Work (Palm Press, 2006) and a=
n
editor of Ugly Duckling Presse, a non-profit volunteer-run publishing
concern in Brooklyn. He translates Daniil Kharms, Alexander Vvedensky, and
Vladimir Mayakovsky, among other Russian writers. He teaches literature at
Hunter College in New York City while working on a graduate degree in
comparative literature and a house in the country.

**Genan Zilkha, guitar/vocals, was a classically trained pianist until she
found that she had a taste of rock and roll. Since that didn't work out, sh=
e
now spends her time writing folk songs with titles such as "I Think I Might
Be Food Poisoning (But it could also be love)" and "I Know What Will Make
You Not A Dyke." Genan is also known for her unique takes on Britney Spears
songs, in particular her version of Britney's version of the Bobby Brown
song "My Prerogative." She has performed at the Knitting Factory, as well a=
s
at venues throughout Rhode Island and Binghamton, NY.

It seems to me psychic state and/or owning a tv is irrelevant.

In visual arts 'outsider art'refers to self taught artists, which usually,
in that realm results in work that those with formal training would call
'primitive.'

I believe they have the same issue of what happens when an 'outsider' is
lionized by the establishment.  And I don't think there's an answer, nor
is it worth worrying about (unless you're an insider and an insider
institution devoting your days to that sort of thing).

Anyone see the movie 'Pecker'?....it's way better than I had expected and
is relevant to the outsider discussion.

I think you're taking the worst aspects of the use of outsider in the visual

are many fine folks who have written about and worked to further the work of
these "outsiders" such as Jonathan Williams, Roger Manley, Fred Fussell, and
many others. Does the concept "outsider" translate beyond the visual arts to
writing or music or dance? Probably but there are additional issues. Is it
meaningful distinction? Only in certain cases and with great caution.

it truly appears that it is a bunch of arts administrators, and collectors

"The term Outsider Art was coined by art critic Roger Cardinal in 1972 as a=
n English synonym for Art Brut (which literally translates as "Raw Art" or =
"Rough Art"), a label created by French artist Jean Dubuffet to describe ar=
t created outside the boundaries of official culture; Dubuffet focused part=
icularly on art by insane asylum inmates.

"While Dubuffet's term is quite specific, the English term "Outsider Art" i=
s often applied more broadly, to include certain self-taught or Na=EFve art=
 makers who were never institutionalized. Typically, those labeled as Outsi=
der Artists have little or no contact with the institutions of the mainstre=
am art world and they often employ unique materials or fabrication techniqu=
es. Much Outsider Art illustrates extreme mental states, unconventional ide=
as, or elaborate fantasy worlds. Since 2000 the EUWARD, the European Award =
for painting and graphic arts by mentally handicapped artists, is providing=
 this art with an international forum.

"Outsider Art has emerged as a successful art marketing category (an annual=
 Outsider Art Fair has taken place in New York since 1992); thus the term i=
s sometimes misapplied as a catch-all marketing label for art created by pe=
ople outside the "art world" mainstream, regardless of their circumstances =
or the content of their work."

some outsider art environments/sites in the Midwest:

http://www.kohlerfoundation.org/index.htm

http://www.westbendgrotto.com/

http://webpages.charter.net/dnance/concpark/concpark-abt.htm

most of these environments were created by single men, and they fall
into categories of religious, patriotic, secular, or mixed (according to
my own survey)... most often they are rural or built on the fringes of a
town or city. we used to have a grotto in St. Paul, but it was bulldozed
in the late 80s.

are there any (true) parallels in the sphere of poetics? examples?

first thing that comes to mind is those poetry prize volumes where the
poets paid the company for the chance to win a prize, and all they get
is this lousy book with 1,000 pages of mostly lousy writing. what's that
called? it's almost like the written equivalent of paint-by-numbers
clown portraits you find at a garage sale -- tacky, but strangely
compelling.  =20

The folk art-outsider connection has always been foremost in my mind.
Grandma Moses was an outsider.  Jean-Michel Basquiat was not.  Both,
however, were unschooled in art.  Basquiat quit school in his junior year of
high school.  These days, I've been hearing a different term applied to
those whose art is not of the folksy variety, but who are not formally
schooled in Universities or Art Institutes:  Raw Vision.  I'm not sure
whether this is a better or worse term, other than most all labels have
extrememely limited usefulness.  The best use of a label is to mail
something.

it real simple - if kenny g his cronies are any way involved (bust magazine- is like having a quota from Spin  magazine or winning the VH1 Independent Spirit Award ) - it's anti outsider - it's so far up inside that the sun isn't ever going near it


  sure a lot of teachers involved in that thing best to stay far outside that neighbourhood

Only two Republicans managed not to vote against Bush's
attempt to deep-six habeas corpus. For shame.

This from the NYTimes:

Rushing Off a Cliff

NYT Published: September 28, 2006

Here's what happens when this irresponsible Congress railroads a profoundly
important bill to serve the mindless politics of a midterm election: The
Bush administration uses Republicans' fear of losing their majority to push
through ghastly ideas about antiterrorism that will make American troops
less safe and do lasting damage to our 217-year-old nation of laws =97 whil=
e
actually doing nothing to protect the nation from terrorists. Democrats
betray their principles to avoid last-minute attack ads. Our democracy is
the big loser.

Republicans say Congress must act right now to create procedures for
charging and trying terrorists =97 because the men accused of plotting the
9/11 attacks are available for trial. That's pure propaganda. Those men
could have been tried and convicted long ago, but President Bush chose not
to. He held them in illegal detention, had them questioned in ways that wil=
l
make real trials very hard, and invented a transparently illegal system of
kangaroo courts to convict them.

It was only after the Supreme Court issued the inevitable ruling striking
down Mr. Bush's shadow penal system that he adopted his tone of urgency. It
serves a cynical goal: Republican strategists think they can win this fall,
not by passing a good law but by forcing Democrats to vote against a bad on=
e
so they could be made to look soft on terrorism.

Last week, the White House and three Republican senators announced a
terrible deal on this legislation that gave Mr. Bush most of what he wanted=
,
including a blanket waiver for crimes Americans may have committed in the
service of his antiterrorism policies. Then Vice President Dick Cheney and
his willing lawmakers rewrote the rest of the measure so that it would give
Mr. Bush the power to jail pretty much anyone he wants for as long as he
wants without charging them, to unilaterally reinterpret the Geneva
Conventions, to authorize what normal people consider torture, and to deny
justice to hundreds of men captured in error.

These are some of the bill's biggest flaws:

Enemy Combatants: A dangerously broad definition of "illegal enemy
combatant" in the bill could subject legal residents of the United States,
as well as foreign citizens living in their own countries, to summary arres=
t
and indefinite detention with no hope of appeal. The president could give
the power to apply this label to anyone he wanted.

The Geneva Conventions: The bill would repudiate a half-century of
international precedent by allowing Mr. Bush to decide on his own what
abusive interrogation methods he considered permissible. And his decision
could stay secret =97 there's no requirement that this list be published.

Habeas Corpus: Detainees in U.S. military prisons would lose the basic righ=
t
to challenge their imprisonment. These cases do not clog the courts, nor
coddle terrorists. They simply give wrongly imprisoned people a chance to
prove their innocence.

Judicial Review: The courts would have no power to review any aspect of thi=
s
new system, except verdicts by military tribunals. The bill would limit
appeals and bar legal actions based on the Geneva Conventions, directly or
indirectly. All Mr. Bush would have to do to lock anyone up forever is to
declare him an illegal combatant and not have a trial.

Coerced Evidence: Coerced evidence would be permissible if a judge
considered it reliable =97 already a contradiction in terms =97 and relevan=
t.
Coercion is defined in a way that exempts anything done before the passage
of the 2005 Detainee Treatment Act, and anything else Mr. Bush chooses.

Secret Evidence: American standards of justice prohibit evidence and
testimony that is kept secret from the defendant, whether the accused is a
corporate executive or a mass murderer. But the bill as redrafted by Mr.
Cheney seems to weaken protections against such evidence.

Offenses: The definition of torture is unacceptably narrow, a virtual
reprise of the deeply cynical memos the administration produced after 9/11.
Rape and sexual assault are defined in a retrograde way that covers only
forced or coerced activity, and not other forms of nonconsensual sex. The
bill would effectively eliminate the idea of rape as torture.

=95There is not enough time to fix these bills, especially since the few
Republicans who call themselves moderates have been whipped into line, and
the Democratic leadership in the Senate seems to have misplaced its spine.
If there was ever a moment for a filibuster, this was it.

We don't blame the Democrats for being frightened. The Republicans have mad=
e
it clear that they'll use any opportunity to brand anyone who votes against
this bill as a terrorist enabler. But Americans of the future won't remembe=
r
the pragmatic arguments for caving in to the administration.

They'll know that in 2006, Congress passed a tyrannical law that will be
ranked with the low points in American democracy, our generation's version
of the Alien and Sedition Acts.

Hi everyone,

I have two major announcements to make as Director of the non-profit litera=
ry arts organization, Combo Arts.  The first is the publication of Katie De=
gentesh=E2=80=99s much anticipated first collection, The Anger Scale.  If y=
ou haven=E2=80=99t heard, this is the best poetry book of the year, winner =
of the Pulitzer Prize, The National Book Award and the National Book Critic=
s Circle Award the minute George W. Bush realizes the error of his ways.  A=
merican poetry=E2=80=99s most unorthodox daughter is BLOWING UP and you don=
=E2=80=99t even realize it! But don=E2=80=99t take my word for it, take the=
 word of my betters:

The psychiatric industry=E2=80=99s tests are essentially a database of all =
that our society wants to expel under the rubric of mential instability. Ka=
tie Degentesh=E2=80=99s The Anger Scale uses the MMPI as its source and fro=
m that writes a series of poems that take as normal all that the MMPI would=
 like to pathologize.  This is a scary book with a complicated politics. It=
 is an uneasy and thus all the more crucial read.

--Juliana Spahr

Don't be fooled by the bawdy surfaces of THE ANGER SCALE. Katie Degentesh's=
 joyous, meta-ballistic poems will guide any reader daring enough to read t=
hem in a realm where everything is turning out just like the prophets of th=
e Bible said it would. you will be shamed by your elders and peers for not =
possessing this book.

--Anselm Berrigan.

Dengentesh's Google conceptualism results in a comic and provocative=20
scan of the unease of American culture as we now fashion and live it.=20

In this secondsh coming of information Katie Degentesh is a very good
Muslim who wants to give Juan Valdez a serious beating.

In case, like me, this Administration - particularly with the continuing and
worsening horror show in Iraq (let alone the associated issues with the
'terror agenda') is sickening to the core - the surmise of Bob (I will
redeem myself) Woodward's new book in the Washington Post provides the start
of what seems an eye-popping transparent view of the madness that claims to
to guide 'us' here in these sad States (right down to Henry Kissinger as

that would signal repeat of the USA's mistake in Vietnam - of apparently
'not staying the course.')!!
What is that line about history 'repeating itself as farce.'

Heah, I am not trying to excuse Woodward for his Republican arse-licking
sins, nor can anybody suspect that he will use the power of the laptop to
push for consequences to these 'revelations.'
And you are right, no amount of 'truth serum' seems to make one bit of
impact on the 'to hell and no come back' policies (let alone the lackey
Congress)  of this Administration - let alone an active opposition by a
public whose opposition seems  only revealed in what ought to be devastating
poll numbers for these clowns. The streets are very quiet.

Woodward does provide a little refreshment on an otherwise depressing ("go
go torture, bye-bye habeus corpus) mundi day.

Yucks,

when i think of 'outsider' in literary terms i think of colin wilson who
published 'the outsider' in 1956. wikipedia says of it: "In 1956, at the age
of 25, he published The Outsider, which examines the seminal works of
various key literary and cultural figures (notably Hermann Hesse, Fyodor
Dostoyevsky, Vaslav Nijinsky and Vincent Van Gogh) and aspects of alienation
in their works. The book was very successful and was a serious contribution
to the popularization of existentialism in Britain."

NEW  TINFISH CHAPBOOK BY JACINTA GALEA`I, ACHING FOR MANGO FRIENDS

Tinfish Press is proud to announce publication of Aching for Mango
Friends, by Jacinta Galea`i.

Jacinta Galea'i has written a 'novel' that is also a sequence of
'poems', calling her genres into question at every turn. She has written
a book in English and Samoan, one that straddles, with equal courage and
precision, geographic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Aching for
Mango Friends offers up a part of this (as yet unpublished) novel/poem
to readers interested in experimental writing, writing from the Pacific,
and intersections between Samoa and the USA.  Jacinta Galea`i earned her
Ph.D. from the University of Hawai`i-Manoa.


    From Grandma's Corner

    Our airplane is in the air now, leaving Pago Pago International
Airport, flying over the pua tree next to our blue house, where Fale,
John, and Mataio play lakapi Amerika and where my father will preach to
people wearing pajamas inside the Lyndon, B. Johnson Hospital Chapel
next Sunday. The airplane is flying higher now, so I cannot see Pele who
had water in her eyes when I told her I was returning to the place in
America I had left three years earlier when I first met her under the
mango tree.

The appetite for coherence is the main cause of our exorbitant and
unnatural fear of things.

-- Letter to Cristophe Guilmoto, 7 April 1979, Prospectus IV, p. 626


A song hollered by a girl while brushing the stairs moves me more than
any exquisitely tasteful cantata. Each to his own taste. I like what is
minimal, and also embryonice, poorly fashioned, imperfect, mixed. I
prefer uncut diamonds, still in their matrix. And with their flaws.

-- fr. "Notes for the Well-read," Prospectus I, p. 88, as quoted in Jean
Dubuffet (by Laurent Danchin)


It is usually by racing on stilts that you learn to ride a bike, by
sailing on a stormy sea that you become a fine dancer, and by playing
the flute that you learn to paint.

-- Letter to Jacques Berne, 17 March 1947, Prospectus II, p. 248 and
Prospectus IV, p. 110


I have always had a high regard for gags; it's always seemed to me that
there is a relationship between the quintessence of art and those absurd
simplifications which provoke laughter.

-- Cahiers Alexandre Viallatte, no. 3: Preface, 2 November 1975

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi, all:

Announcing the Australian publication and the separate British/USA publication of

     John Tranter: Urban Myths: 210 Poems: New and Selected

The British/USA edition was published in September 2006 by Salt Publishing in Cambridge UK.

     http://www.saltpublishing.com/books/smp/1844712524.htm

        EAN13:  9781844712526
        ISBN-10:  1844712524
        ISBN-13:  9781844712526
        436 pages, paperback

The Australian edition, which is virtually identical, was published in June 2006 by the University of Queensland Press.

     http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/book_details.php?id=0702235571

        322 pages. ISBN-0-7022-3557-1, paperback.

"Tranter has produced a body of work remarkable for its intellectual vitality, formal versatility, and powers of renewal over a long and formidable career."
          -- Peter Pierce, The Melbourne Age, July 15, 2006.
              Peter Pierce is professor of Australian literature
              at James Cook University.

"This new and selected poems reminds us, if we needed reminding, just how powerful John Tranter's cumulated work is. There is a density, an intensity, and a many-sided explorativeness that probably cannot be matched in Australian poetry. Surprisingly, at 210 poems, it is a comparatively small book and has been pretty ruthlessly selected, but there is no doubting the size of its author's achievement."
          -- Martin Duwell, Australian Book Review, August 2006, page 41

The Australian edition of Urban Myths has won the 2006 Victorian Premier's Prize (C.J.Dennis Prize) for poetry. From the judges' report:

"The new and uncollected poems in John Tranter's Urban Myths make a significant addition to his oeuvre. Control and ease are evident in the writing, which displays personages, occasions and moods of the metropolitan modern world. Tranter's latest poems refresh through the exercise of urbane skills: this is a poet suave and playful, but never aloof; linguistically various, assured in style, and never less than fully attentive."

In a rash moment I have provided over a  hundred pages of notes to the poems on my Internet homepage at

     http://johntranter.com/notes/um.shtml

The notes are published only on the Internet, and not in the book. They are provided for whatever interest they may have, and are not meant be necessary for an appreciation of the poems.

Please excuse redundant or superfluous postings of this muted trumpet voluntary.

Best,

We have lately had a number of accomplished Hindoo visitors at
Cambridge, who talked freely of life and philosophy. More than one of
them has confided to me that the sight of our faces, all contracted as
they are with the habitual American over-intensity and anxiety of
expression, and our ungraceful and distorted attitudes when sitting,
made on him a very painful impression. "I do not see," said one, "how it
is possible for you to live as you do, without a single minute in your
day deliberately given to tranquillity and meditation. It is an
invariable part of our Hindoo life to retire for at least half an hour
daily into silence, to relax our muscles, govern our breathing, and
meditate on eternal things. Every Hindoo child is trained to this from a
very early age." The good fruits of such a discipline were obvious in
the physical repose and lack of tension, and the wonderful smoothness
and calmness of facial expression, and imperturbability of manner of
these Orientals. I felt that my countrymen were depriving themselves of
an essential grace of character. How many American children ever hear it
said by parent or teacher, that they should moderate their piercing
voices, that they should relax their unused muscles, and as far as
possible, when sitting, sit quite still? Not one in a thousand, not one
in five thousand! Yet, from its reflex influence on the inner mental
states, this ceaseless over-tension, overmotion, and over-expression are
working on us grievous national harm.

I beg you teachers to think a little seriously of this matter. Perhaps
you can help our rising generation of Americans toward the beginning of
a better set of personal ideals.

For an outsider to be an outsider an insider would have to have first insidered him, even if momentarily, so as to establish his status as outsider in comparison with or through the scope of insiderness. The whole while, of course, promoting the status of the inside.

They did one of the best classic top 40 (top 10) Am singles--uh
garage rock but with trumpets--in 1966...

"I can't wait for ever....even though you want me too..."

a few years later, after the outsiders broke up the lead singer
ended up in Climax--
uh from outsiders not being able to wait too long
to "if i can't find my way back home---it just wouldn't be fair"
(precious and few)....

My book of poetry is finally available for pre-order.  Also, anybody want to review it in
a journal?  Just give me a hollar.

Go here: http://www.etsy.com/view_item.php?listing_id=508626

Christine's poetry has been described as:

"a whirling carnival of family dysfunction, talking animals and deathbed confessions.
These poems are discarded doll's heads littering a dried-out field. They give you the
feeling you've just walked into a situation you weren't supposed to witness but can't
stop watching. They suck you in, spin you around and leave you breathless." (Cheryl B.)

Here's a sample from one of the poems, Animal Husbandry:

"The dog tells me that's he leaving me, that he no longer likes sticking his nose in my
crotch. This last week he has been slipping his leash after I fall asleep and going to
the backroom at Woody's. He tells me about the glory holes in the bathroom of the New
York Public Library. I tell him he's lying, that dogs aren't allowed in the library..."

Creepy, and quite sexy. For more info, go to Christine Hamm's website:
www.christinehamm.org.

Will ship on October 14th.

-- if there are four members of the trinity, instead of three, is that
because the trinity took an outsider, inside, or because the insider "pivot"
of the trinity, went outside, allowing for four points? -- if a triangle
becomes a square which corner moves? -- if the spirit is the vehicle by

Subject:      pascal/art brut ("outsider")
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

i was away from list for some days so just found the note below re pascal's
"Wager"  and catching up on The Outsiders (60s Ohio band, hit was "Time
Won't Let Me"; S E Hinton "young adult" novel made into 1983 film by Coppola
. . .  and a tv series in 1990 . . . see art brut below--)

re Pascal--trying to recall the context/discussion & apologize had a problem
with hotmail and message was sent more than was meant to be--as i recall i
thought of "The Wager" in context of infinity/god which was brought up at
one point--extension without limits--not in the sense stephen baraban brings
up here--

robert smithson was interested in what he called the Pascalian
dialectic--Pascal builds his thoughts often around paradoxes--many times
with a form of gallows humor--i have often wondered if "The Wager" isn't
really a form of cynicism carried into the arena of gallows humor--a good
laugh on pascal's part at all those who bemoaned the loss of one of europe's
finest scientitific and mathematical minds to the narrow theological
confines of jansenism--by means of "The Wager" pascal could show his old
fans that the man had lost  none of his edge at probablility problems and at
the same time harness it to prove to them the wisdom of choosing good rather
than science in the biggest "throw" of all----that he had chosen the right
path--so a form of elaborate joke--
when i thought more about it, the cynicism and gallows humor grows
deeper--as only examples of gambling  that came to mind in my rather small
knowledge of Bible are those of the gambling for Joseph's Coat of Many
Colors, which prefigures that of the Roman soldiers playing for Christ's
clothes--
so gambling is associated with moments of humiliation, pain and mockery of
Joseph and Jesus--
by using this method of mockery turned inside out to prove the existence of
God, pascal in a sense is mocking the mockers, causing them pain and
humiliation--just as he has been toying with those who feel he "lost
everything" in giving up math and science for the church--
as the saying in french has it, "tromper le trompeur c'est double
plaisir"--to trump the one who set the trumps is a double pleasure--
(this interpretation purely speculative and done for amusement--)


because the art market has made terms like "outsider art", "raw vision" etc
etc take on such a cynical cast--what was it about them that had meaning and
energy in the first place?--is worth it to remember--so one cd rethink some
of the issues involved--make use of them in different ways--

in popular music for some decades collecting of garage band obscurities for
example-truly "brut" recordings in every sense---(i used to have several
hundreds of lps, compilations, 45s etc--friends with far more--)--films out
now  of people like daniel johnson and wesley walls etc--"art brut" muicians
so to speak--

must be tons of "art brut" writing out there--as well as already
published--is "art brut"different in writing than in art and music?--it's
not like you find "anthology of writing brut"--i mean "brut" in dubuffet's
sense of it, not the "outsider" sense usually tossed abt like "outlaw bible
of american poetry" etc--but wd writing world have same enthusiasm for brut
writing that brut music and art generate in their worlds?--

art brut/outsider art has its modern beginings mainly in the interests of
artists in expanding sources of inspiration--Japan for the Impressionists,
Tahiti for Gauguin, African suclpture for Picasso etc--and for the Blaue
Reiter group in Germany that included Kandinsky--children's art and
drawings.  the attraction of "primitive" and children's art was to "get
outside" the strictures and confines of training in western art--a way to
begin at the begining in a certain sense--
     also begining in later nineteenth century was interest in spirtualism
and psychic states which generated a huge body of works in writing and
graphic arts--(Victor Hugo produced a very substantial and striking volume
of work in both media--a lot of the extraordinary graphic work on line and
the written in Conversations with Eternity  The Forgotten Masterpiece of
Victor Hugo;  New Paradigm, 1998)--these were forerunners of
psychology--leading to study of works produced by the mentally ill--"Marcel
Reja's" (Paul Meunier) L'Art chez les fous (The Art of the Mad/of Madpeople)
  appeared in 1907.  In 1922 appeared the book which marked huge revolution
in many fields and in  effects of art of the mentally ill on modern
art--Hans Prinzhorn's Bildnerei der Geisteskranken (Artistry of the mentally
Ill)--the previous year had appeared Walter Morgenthaler's first study of an
"outsider"/"art brut" artist--in english known as Madness and Art:  The Life
and Works of Adolf Wolfli.  A breakthrough in the study of work by the
mentally ill occured in these works:  the art of the mentally ill began to
be considered in terms of art, not simply in terms of symptoms,
manifestations of various disorders etc.  During this same time period
"primitve" and "folk art" were also being reevaluated in terms of "art" in
their own right--
it should be noted that a great deal of the works found outside asylums were
found by artists--not collectors, dealers etc as is much more the case later
on--it took artist's eyes to see in much of the outsider art before there
was a term for it the existence of art in it--the exception being with in
the asylums--and this too began to change when Dubuffet began building his
immense collection of "art brut" in the 1940's-- (again, an artist led the
way to perceiving art values not only to be looked at, but to be put to use
by artists--and used also in his battery of "anti-cultural positions"--and
gave them the name "art brut"--)
the connection between the as yet unnamed "art brut" and modern art was
recognnized by the nazis in the infamous 1937-8 traveling exhibtion of
Entartete Kunst (Degenerate Art)--one of the first true blockbuster shows of
the twentieth century, attended by roughly two million people in its journey
through germany into Austria--works by Wolfli and other "outsider"/mentally
ill artists hung alongside works by the greats and lesser lights of
modernism--all of them equally condmened--ironically the Nazis were the
first to stage a kind of exhibition which was to become common in later
decades--the mingling of outsider works with "high art" by
"masters"--"professionals"--hanging alongside the insane, the amateur, the
folk artist, the self taught, etc--

Dubuffet very early on chose not to focus on madness as the basis of art
brut--art brut is work done by people 'WHO ARE STRANGERS TO THE ORDINARY ART
WORLD,  KNOWING LITTLE ABOUT CURRENT WORKS OF ART, OR PERHAPS EVEN
DELIBERATELY DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM ALL THAT."  wORKS OF THE MAD WOULD
NATURALLY BE INCLUDED, BUT NOT SIMPLY AS WORKS BY THE MAD . . .

in the late 1940's andre breton worked closely with dubuffet and shared his
collections of obejcts in art brut shows etc--worked hard in developiong
projects for art brut almanac that didn't materialize until the later series
of publications--and developed close friendship with dubuffet--though the
latter was from the start also a bit wary--in the end thay had a falling out
over the issue of madness--for breton madness and spiritualism played a
central role in the interest of art brut--whereas for dubuffet they do not
not--he didn't care if an artist was mad or not--included works by the sane
and insane in alternating shows to emphasize that these were not soley the
provenance of the mentally ill--(a stereotype which has peristsed all too
often to this day--)--dubuffet considered the works in themselves--not as
manifestations of this or that pathology--he also felt that Breton wanted to
subsume art brut under the umbrella of surrealism, tucked away in a corner
along with other works by the mad or the spiritualists--yet another form of
surrealist bric-a-brac to be added to the collection--the exact opposite of
the kind of impact dubuffet hoped the works would have in breaking
preconceived ideas and heiracrhies of "art"--as traditonally conceived of in
the west--

by Dubuffet in english on his anti-cultural positions a very good book is--
ASPHYXIATING CULTURE

There is a great book on the history of Dubuffet's involvement with Art Brut
and the history of his collection after his death, as well as the years
preceding Dubuffet's development of "art brut" going back to early 19th
century--ART BRUT  The Origins of Outsider Art by Lucienne Peiry  (Paris:
Flammarion, 2001)  illustrated by hundreds of color and b and w
reproductions and fotos, with biographies of the artists, extensive
bibliographies;  Ms Peiry is the Head of the Collection de l'Art Brut in
Lausanne, Switzerland--the collection begun by Dubuffet--

In a handwritten document written in english called "anticultural positions"
given as a lecture at the art club of chicago on thursday 20 december 1951
at 11:30 am dubuffet says, making a point he is repeat in a variety of ways
regarding langauge:

     Art addresses itself to the mind, and not to the eyes.  It has always
been  considered this way by primitive peoples, and they are right.  Art is
a language, instrument of knowledge, insturment of expression.
     I think the enthousiasm aabout the language of the words, which I
mentioned before, has been the reason our culture started to regard painting
as a rough, rudimentary, and even contemptible language, good only for
illiterate people.  From that, culture invented, as a rationalization for
art, this mith (sic) of plastic beauty, which, in my opinion, is an
imposture.
     I just said, and I repeat now, painting is, in my opinion. is a lnguage
much richer than that of words.  So itis quite useless to look for
rationalizations in art.
     Painting is a language much more immediate and at the same time much
mre charged with meaning.  Painting operates through signs which are not
abstract and incorporeal like words.  The signs of painting are much closer
to the objects themselves.  Further painting manipulates materials which are
themselves living substances.  That is why painting allows one to go much
further than words do in apporaching things and conjuring them.
    Painting can also, and it is very remarkable, conjure things more or
less, as wanted, I mean:  with more or less presence;  that is to say:  at
different stages between being and non-being.
     At last painting can conjure things, not isolated, but linked to all
that surrounds them; a great many things simultaaneously.
     On the other hand painting is a way much more immediate and muc more
direct than language of words, much clsoer to the cry, or to the danse; that
is why  painting is a way of expression of our inner voices much more
effective than that of words.
      I just said that painting allows, especially, much better than words,
one to express the various stages of thought, including the deeper levels,
the underground stages of mental processes . . .

(one can see where this wd open one to begin thinkingconversely what might
be a writing brut--in what ways writing might opearte that painting cannot
do as well . . . )
from what dubuffet writes here, one can have an idea what itis he is finding
in art brut--the values of immediacy, directness and a language of the
mind--thought processes of an underground  . . . in the stages of
thought--as well as a way of conjuring stages between being and non-being .
. . etc etc--very much a language, a cry a danse--with the living materials,
substances and signs which are close to objects  . . .

Here's what happens when this irresponsible Congress railroads a profoundly
