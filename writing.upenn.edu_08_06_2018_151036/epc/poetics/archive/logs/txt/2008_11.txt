Tom, Barry, David,

Appropriation is the basic Medieval mode of writing, either, as Barry says,
citation being the prevalent trope of writing or as outright appropriation.
Chaucer is the great appropriator in English literature. Troylus and Cresyda
is for all purposes, with some changes, of Boccaccio's Philostrato, without
Chaucer ackknowledging it as such. This does not mean that he was being
dishonest or propagating a hoax, simply that that was a natural Medieval
writing process. A number of Chaucer's earlier works (the titles escape me
now) start with a dream passage, introducing or framing the narrative which
will follow. This was a common Medieval trope. A number of times, Chaucer
lifts his dream passages from French examples.

To understand the process better, it might be helpful to look at Medieval
Cathedrals, masterpieces with no named architects. The whole construct is
seen as a communal activity, something beyond the individual or authorship.
The same ethos, an ethos of poetics, applies to writing also. Ruskin
understood this. I think it is the source of his modernity. When David, Kent
Johnson, myself and a few others, in various ways, attack the notion of
originality or authorship, elevating the editor, the translator, the
anthologist, the creator of hoaxes, the heteronymous author, the hypertext
to a central position, replacing these tropes for the figure of the "poet,"
they are actually trying to go back to the same Medieval view of authorship
and creation. Recently, Jerome Rothenberg and I had a conversation where we
discussed the concept of the anthology being the ideal form of a sacred
text. That discusion also, I believe, were along the same lines.

Though in the 17th century the idea of the individual author was already
present, one can see in certain authors the earlier prominence of citation
still in full swing. One can cite three works along these lines where
appropriations are integral to the text: Burton's *The Anatomy of Melancholy
*, Browne's "Urn Buryals," Montaigne's *Essays*.

If I remember correctly, Swift's *The Tale of the Tub* parodies the same
style of appropriation in its person; nevertheless, in this parody the
earlier style is still in full force. In English Literature, I think Johnson
and Pope give a "temporarily fatal blow" to the process mocking its
rube-like primitiveness (even Shakespeare could not escape the opprobrium)
and elevating originality to a poetic ideal.

Ciao,

Murat

Dear Barry:

many thanks for this book suggestion--
i've read other texts which desribed through time the incredible amassing of
Talmudic commentaries, and commentaries upon thse and more in turn upon
those--
and as you write, yes, it becomes an endless many authored series of words
reaching back to one intial word pehrps, or very small phrase--

heidegger has his own manner of examining "etymologies" in this way in his
efforts to ask "waht is called thinking?-" and other questions--

and today one finds these very peculair versions of the Taoist, Talmudic,
old Latin Christain commentaries and the great and ongoing ones in Islam and
Buddhism, throughout the world--
which are the ministers one finds on the tv who explain the roots of words
in such as a way that it slants further the already really "new versions" of
the Bible--
which are written in an American english i don't recongize but perhaps that
indicates it is the Word of God, who knows--

in music one finds this very much--in Jazz and soul music, blues for example
there are so many versions and allusions to one song or a few bars of a very
well knwon song--and these build in delta build ups--horizonatally and
vertically--of sound and allusions to previous versions--
sometimes one in particualr, sometimes a number of them--so as one listens
one hards the sounds and voices of a great many others--al of them quoted
and alluded to, hinted at, evoked--
and then given a new feeling, tone, vividness--shiftings in the
emotionswhich make appear whole new configurations of meaning than one had
found in that song before--

and in the theater one finds this also--and some forms of poetry recitals,
where a ceratin pewrson's style is being alluded to or copied, mimiced, as
triobute, homage or satire-or a put down
or simply a gesture of ear whacking contempt!

there is the other sign of the coin so to speak in which apporopriation can
takeon an aspect of the "stealing of souls" as in the fear of havingone's
photo taken--

or an old Mowhak in-law of mine who never spoke on the telphone
becuase--itis not speaking with people who are "present"--
in which case one cannot trust them, these voices--

even though they may sound exaclty like so and so

how doesone know it is them--
or even thatitis aliving voice and notone from thelandof the dead
(which mary baker eddy had an interst in as witness her having aphone you
can try calling her on in her vault in mt auburn cemetery in cambridge, ma)

the question one might ask of appropriation after a ceratin point is how
much of it is sued to simply make the previous users of an image or term or
poem etc simply vanish into a palimpssest become graveyard--

so that quoattion may become a form of erasure--

or turn into simply an ever more distanced set of terms which become
eventually abstractions, without any particualr meaning letin them at
all--and so exist as decorative designs on the walls around a villa--

which no one reads though they actaully "know" them--

in that way what wasonce a visible sign becomes a covert form of
suggestion" perhaps, concealed inside a formal decorative desing--
or simply vecomes so commonplace that it turns into being a stok in trade of
jokes

another way of using appropriated materials of course is to say--they are
not my words which say these things--i simply am using thesematerials as
part of aproject--

so an approproiator--may mmanage to use this method to absolve of
respsoanbality their actions when it comes to something which according to
the emily post school of appropriation it is not appropriate to approprioate

alsothe concepts of how much does one reveal of onself and how much does one
conceal by the use of approrpriation--

do those used actually give or hide any indicationsof who itis that has
chosen them and what may or may not be their motives?

also , another weay to give credence to things that are "faked" for example,
is to begin "quoting them"--so that the quotes get picked up and are quoted
and cited elsehwere andon into a chain of citations establishing as having a
"real, concrete existence" things whih are not at all real but simply those
things like joe the plumber that are "plants"--

in this manner one may play games with those who appriate by laying traps
ahead of time for them!

a kind of ruins in revrse set up in whcih what comes after this opening move
which is a pitfall of destruction--simply falls into the trap, rather than
adding on to the endless seriesof supllements--

i have to stop before getting too dizzy and go catch abus!

I don't know if anyone has mentioned Lautreamont yet; his strategies are
discussed some in this paper by Raphael Rubinstein on Ubuweb:
http://www.ubu.com/papers/rubinstein.html

I seem to recall some passages of Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray being
copied wholesale from furniture and plant catalogs.

History and Forms of Lyric Series
Gabriel Levin: The Tailor=92s Dummy

November 5, 4:30 PM
Cobb 203
5811 S. Ellis Ave

Reception to follow.

This lecture will meditate on the practice of literary translation. =20
Levin will read from a selection of journal entries he made in 2007. =20
At the time, the improvisatory nature of jottings in a journal served =20=

as a catalyst for working through the inherent slipperiness and =20
contradictions of the craft. Entries include reflections on childhood =20=

and the initial impulse to translate his surroundings and move on =20
associatively into the realm of dreams and Greek drama (Alcestis), his =20=

efforts to find metaphorical equivalences for the translation of=97for =20=

the most part=97Hebrew poetry. Some entries bounce off the writings of =20=

others, such as Rosenzweig, Frost, Borges, Middleton, and Paterson, =20
while others deal with poems he happened to be working on at the time. =20=

Levin will provide a handout of translations from the work of two such =20=

Hebrew poets: one modern, Avot Yeshurun (1904-1992), and the other =20
medieval, Yehuda Halevi (circa 1075-1141). In the latter case we will =20=

be looking at two versions of the same poem, returning to a =20
translation he=92d previously abandoned in a renewed attempt to render =20=

the poem into English.

The Poem Present Reading and Lecture Series
Geraldine Monk and Alan Halsey

Reading from their work.
November 6, 4:30 PM
Rosenwald 405
1101 E. 58th St.

Reception to follow.

Poetics Lecture: The Last Wounded Animal in the Wood.
November 7, 1:00 PM
Harper 148
1116 East 59th St.

Reception to follow.

Drawing on their extensive experience with collaboration, the poets =20
will discuss its various forms, how it affects the text and the =20
occasional problems and pitfalls, all with examples and amusing =20
anecdotes.


Geraldine Monk was born in the county of Lancashire, in the northwest =20=

of England in 1952. Since the 1970s her poetry has appeared in =20
numerous anthologies and magazines. Her major volumes of poetry =20
include Interregnum (Creation Books 1995), Noctivagations (2001), and =20=

Escafeld Hangings (2005), both published by West House Books. Her =20
Selected Poems was published by Salt Publishing in 2003. A collection =20=

of essays on her poetry, The Salt Companion to Geraldine Monk, edited =20=

by Scott Thurston, appeared in 2007.

Alan Halsey was born in London in 1949. He ran the Poetry Bookshop in =20=

Hay-on-Wye 1979-96. Since 1997 he has lived in Sheffield, continuing =20
to work as a specialist bookseller and editor of West House Books. His =20=

own books include The Text of Shelley=92s Death (Five Seasons, 1995), =20=

Marginalien, a collection of poems, prose texts & graphics (Five =20
Seasons 2005), and Not Everything Remotely: Selected Poems 1978-2005 =20
(Salt 2006). His several collaborations include Fit to Print with =20
Karen Mac Cormack (Coach House 1998) and Days of =9149 with Gavin =20
Selerie (West House 1999). His text-graphic work Memory Screen was =20
most shown at the Bury Text Festival 2005 and his graphic work =20
includes a collaboration with Steve McCaffery, Paradigm of the =20
Tinctures (Granary 2007).

This may be a minor point, but I feel that there's some serious anachronism
going on in this discussion. Borrowings and stealings (but rarely beggings)
need a name now because the act is deemed to stand apart from our more
common cultural image of the artistic act. We call this appropriation now
because of our concepts of ownership as applied to words and ideas, along
with the assumption that, by default, one does not have permission to take
over that ownership.

Surely we can't call Shakespeare appropriative in this way, let alone
authors closer to the oral tradition.

"the question one might ask of appropriation after a ceratin point is how
much of it is sued to simply make the previous users of an image or term or
poem etc simply vanish into a palimpssest become graveyard--

so that quoattion may become a form of erasure--"

David,

"Palimpsest becoming a graveyard," isn't this one of the basic way poetry,
language as a force continue to exist, in the graveyard? Is this not what
Spicer's *After Lorca* and Kent Johnson's *The Miseries of Poetry* are
saying?

"or turn into simply an ever more distanced set of terms which become
eventually abstractions, without any particualr meaning letin them at
all--and so exist as decorative designs on the walls around a villa--.

which no one reads though they actually "know" them--

in that way what wasonce a visible sign becomes a covert form of
suggestion" perhaps, concealed inside a formal decorative desing--"

Yes. As you say, "hiding in plain sight." I noticed that converto architects
in Spain, after the defeat of the Moors and the onset of The Inquisition,
often place Stars of David, as secret signatures, among the decorations in
the walls or entrances.

"or simply vecomes so commonplace that it turns into being a stok in trade
of
jokes"

Doesn't a lot of Shakespeare in English or Orhan Veli in Turkish live as
integrated pieces of language in everyday conversation? Isn't that one of
the most important ways a poet goes on living?

Ciao,

Murat

Murat, Tom, Barry, David,
                  As we are seeing "appropriation"'s precursors are varied =
and commonplace, to the extent that
the term itself appears reductive--Chaucer's only 'a great appropriator' if=
 his practice is presumed to be informed by a modern idea (and its attentio=
n laws and prohibitions)of authorship. =20
                  I am more interested in the varieties of contemporary 'ap=
propriation' --it seems such a dumbly provocative term, so post-modern fer =
crissakes--which is the way Murat's remarks about  recent 'attacks on autho=
rship and orginality' are pointed.  The value of a geneology of appropriati=
on, or a pre-history of authorship seems to be that it may help generate  a=
 typology of current practices and possibilities in which re-use, refried, =
is understood as  more like the norm than the exception.=20

Subject: Re: appropriative poetics: genealogy/history?

Tom, Barry, David,

Appropriation is the basic Medieval mode of writing, either, as Barry says,
citation being the prevalent trope of writing or as outright appropriation.
Chaucer is the great appropriator in English literature. Troylus and Cresyd=
a
is for all purposes, with some changes, of Boccaccio's Philostrato, without
Chaucer ackknowledging it as such. This does not mean that he was being
dishonest or propagating a hoax, simply that that was a natural Medieval
writing process. A number of Chaucer's earlier works (the titles escape me
now) start with a dream passage, introducing or framing the narrative which
will follow. This was a common Medieval trope. A number of times, Chaucer
lifts his dream passages from French examples.

To understand the process better, it might be helpful to look at Medieval
Cathedrals, masterpieces with no named architects. The whole construct is
seen as a communal activity, something beyond the individual or authorship.
The same ethos, an ethos of poetics, applies to writing also. Ruskin
understood this. I think it is the source of his modernity. When David, Ken=
t
Johnson, myself and a few others, in various ways, attack the notion of
originality or authorship, elevating the editor, the translator, the
anthologist, the creator of hoaxes, the heteronymous author, the hypertext
to a central position, replacing these tropes for the figure of the "poet,"
they are actually trying to go back to the same Medieval view of authorship
and creation. Recently, Jerome Rothenberg and I had a conversation where we
discussed the concept of the anthology being the ideal form of a sacred
text. That discusion also, I believe, were along the same lines.

Though in the 17th century the idea of the individual author was already
present, one can see in certain authors the earlier prominence of citation
still in full swing. One can cite three works along these lines where
appropriations are integral to the text: Burton's *The Anatomy of Melanchol=
y
*, Browne's "Urn Buryals," Montaigne's *Essays*.

If I remember correctly, Swift's *The Tale of the Tub* parodies the same
style of appropriation in its person; nevertheless, in this parody the
earlier style is still in full force. In English Literature, I think Johnso=
n
and Pope give a "temporarily fatal blow" to the process mocking its
rube-like primitiveness (even Shakespeare could not escape the opprobrium)
and elevating originality to a poetic ideal.

Ciao,

Murat

Navel gazing, highly biographical, cathartic lyricism, obnoxious punning,
moot metaphor, unabashed self-consciousness, and run-on sentences of
self-promotion are qualities nary as compelling as in the case of NYC's Liv
Carrow. Her songs are like the little animals that your 4-year-old nieces
and nephews make out of play-doh; lumpy yet distinguishable in form,
rudimentary to the point of psychedelic complexity, dry and crumbly on the
outside but all kinds of squishy on the inside.

The mysterious and oddly lovable bassist from ecstatically weird acts
Huggabroomstik and Griffin and the True Believers takes the scenic back roa=

observations on life, death, love, health food, human reproduction, the
unseen world of cosmic currents, awkward crushes, metaphysics, and,
everyone's favorite, despair.

Her influences run the gauntlet from Patsy Cline to Kate Bush to Michael

Wystan,

For Petrarch, who might be considered the inventor of modernism, I am
paraphrasing, desire for fame is the last infirmity of the poetic mind. What
is fame but an anticipation of the idea of property residing in a single
individual. The implication is that the poet owns his (in Pertrarch's time a
man) poem.

When I am defending the idea of a poem belonging, through appropriations, to
a whole community, I may be critical or provocative within the capitalist
definition of appropriation as ownership; but, simultaneously, I am pointing
that the other meaning of appropriation -which completely negates the
"contemporary" one- has been the practice geographically much more wide and
historically for a much longer period of time.

Ciao,

Murat

In a note regarding the appended glossary at the book's end, William S
Burroughs in his Introduction to Junkie (1953) writes:  "A final glossary,
therefore, may not be made of words whose intentions are fugitive."

One aspect of both translation and appropriation is precisely that what is
done with the original text is NOT to copy, as Murat notes, but indeed to
create meta-narratives of and/or with/for them, and not necessarily paralle=
l
ones, either.

This last point, for me at any rate, is important to keep in mind, for in
examing the questions of translations and appropriations, one needs to
remain aware of the possiblities for these to be used in ways which, while
being "camouflaged" perhaps as "artistic," may instead be directed in more
sinister directions.  As usual, there are a good many more than "two sides
to a story," and it is in fact this very potentiality, these many
possiblities, and the uncertainty principle in regards to which are being
activated--that makes the activity of working with as well as studying such
materials a more complex and subtly varieagted one than may at first be
supposed.

For example, in referring to Walter Benjamin and his "Arcades Project,"
Murat notes Benjamin's envisioning a work made entirely of quotations, whic=
h
would be an aspect of the philosopher's conception of an "ideal language."

To open some of the myraid possiblities in any given moment in the act/work
of apprropriation and/or translation, let's use for a few moments the point
of view of Burroughs' words whose intentions are fugitive.

The figure of "Benjamin's Baudelaire," which has become a more familiar and
preferred "Baudelaire" for many English speaking readers than the actual (s=
o
to speak) Baudelaire and his actual works, is a "living example" of this
form of "ideal language" functioning in the direction of a totalizing
system, in which the "colonization" of the past is carried out in order to
draw from it the indications of the immediate or eventual triumph of the
translator/appropriator's ideology/theology/theory of preference.  That is,
one amasses and arranges the objects and quotations of the past in such a
way as to become the accurate predictors of a future envisioned via rear
projection and reverse engineering.  Thus, perhaps, a new form of astrology
may be created as well as "theses on history."

One might look at this from the point of view of a language "whose
intentions are fugitive" and recognize in this "ideal language" the dream o=
f
an entropic steady state of "security" in all senses of the word, in which
the desire for a homogeneity is realized.

One may examine both translations and appropriations in terms of what frame
the translator/appropriator is working to insert the "original" work into.
That is, the frame of the translator/appropriator's conception of an "ideal
language," whether of poetry, history, ideology, theory etc.  within the
language and society in which they would like their
translation/appropriation to "succeed," to "convince the reader of the valu=
e
of the work beyond its original words and tongue."

In a fitting sense, since this work may involve legal difficulties at some
point, the translator/appropriator may become a from of advocate for the
"case" of the work of so-and-so to be included in the files of the  "ideal
language" and the culture which it is participating in the formation of.  T=
o
"argue the case," so to speak, it may be necessary to withhold some
evidence, and exaggerate perhaps the importance of other bits and pieces of
"evidences."  To alter the meaning of a word here or mute the tone of
another there.  Small shifts spread over the course of a poem, a collection=
,
a body of work, accrue and accumulate and so build from within the un-ideal
original the structure of its "meta-narrative," a new and ideal shining Cit=
y
from out of the shell of the old, to paraphrase the IWW slogan.

At a certain level then, what is sought for via such aspects of translation=
s
and/or appropriations is to produce works which are in conformity with the
standards desired by the society/culture into which they are being
introduced, at least for "the time being," and hopefully "for a long time t=
o
come."

The underlying impetus of this might be thought of as the resistance to the
uncertainty principle, and the desire for a "security" even in what are
called "risky" or "experimental" phases and forms of work.

It is in this sense that an artist like Dubuffet observes the action and
writes of an "asphyxiating culture."  The "Arcades Project" from this
perspective becomes an immense temple-tomb, a colossal assemblage of
bric-a-brac on the order of Citizen Kane's Xanadu, a monument to another
aspect of the Benjaminian cosmology, "The Collector."

"The Collector" aspect of constructing the "ideal language," via
translations, appropriations, is that one becomes a tourist and, if so
capable, a tour-guide, which is what many of Benjamin's works basically
are.  The Situationists, who conceived of themselves as drifters among the
psycho-geographies of the urbanscapes, setting out on the long patrols of
the derive , scoffed at both conventional and "cultured/philosophical"
tourism as "tourism in other people's misery."  From this point of view,
translation/appropriation becomes the collecting and "taking possession" in
all senses of the word, of  photos, images, icons, objects, texts, musics,
dances which paradoxically belong to others who can't have them, or can't
have them in the way that the one "taking possession" of them does.

  The irony is that in the age of "intellectual property," the "death of th=
e
author" should become such an idealized trope, because if anything, the
"author" is more alive than ever.

Again, the spectre of the legal profession arises, the one in which Bartleb=
y
made his decision to "prefer not to" be a copyist anymore, and simply
become, literally, "silent as the Tombs" in which appropriately named penal
institution he perished, he, the former handler of "dead letters."  For
today one witnesses the spectacle of legal entanglements regarding the
appropriation or translation of authors' works, or of their appropriations
of others' appropriations, and a Ron Silliman can threaten to sue an
anthology which attaches his name (owned by him) to a poem not written by
him.  (What would happen if a poem written by him were published as an
anonymous piece, or attributed to some totally unknown, perhaps even
non-existent "name"?)

Until late in the 19th century, there was no copyright to protect American
authors from having their works pirated and distributed to great profit by
publishers aboard, especially in England.  An aspect of the plagiarism that
so obsessed Poe was that an author could steal willy nilly from another, an=
d
so make money off another's labor without having to do the actual work at
all.  The attacks Poe made on plagiarism were  not always so much about
"intellectual property" and "originality" as about the artist being paid fo=
r
their time and labor and sharing in the profits it created for the
publishers.  Poe understood this from his own experience, as he had been
employed at one point on basically plagiarizing an entire book on
conchology, adding just enough "original" touches here and there to make th=
e
pirated edition appear "not the same, but new,"  for the benefit and profit
of the publishers. This form of "authorship" was fairly common at the time,
and one that was a logical progression from the earlier heyday of Travel
Literature (discussed in a previous post.)

In the earlier phases, travel literature ranged wildly from rather crude
cobblings of roughly smacked together bits and pieces of others' works,
with, if the cobbler of the work had some imagination, some "previously
unrecorded" and  especially thrilling and "New! Astonishing! Marvels Never
Before Seen nor Heard Of!" thrown into the mix to add to the sales and also
to the ever more hallucinatory visions of the lands on the other side of th=
e
Atlantic, the Indian or Pacific Oceans.
(I recently came across an advertisement trumpeting the latest edition of a=
n
old classic of the Travel Literature days, one which is made up of a good
bit of plagiarism, some invention and some pure nonsense that the Indians
had fobbed off on the gullible explorers.  The book is still in print as
having yet a value as a guidebook to the areas it concerns! )

Lautreamont and Poe made great use of this tradition of license being
extended in travel literature and works on such subjects as conchology--for
Lautreamont's Chants de Maldoror are constructed with vast swathes of pure
plagiarism, cheerfully mixed in with le Comte's Baroque treatments of the
Gothic tradition from earlier in the same century, and plenty of doses of
scientific jargon culled from various dust collecting texts.

(Witness also the opening of Moby Dick, which consists of the etymologies
and examples of the names of the whale through time and around the globe,
among many many languages and cultures.)

I noted before that there is a relationship--as there is in Moby
Dick--between the uses of appropriation and translations, mimicry and
copying, which make of  writing potentially a form of acting, even of an
acting in a theater constructed by the writer and in which the writer
becomes both the director and the leading character or characters.  It is
possible also for the writer to become the audience as well and in turn the
critics, who provide reviews, commentaries, blurbs, hatchet jobs and fawnin=
g
notes of introduction for some favorite of theirs whom they wish to promote
in the role of a kind of "private agent."  This dispersal of the "writer"
through so many roles in turn begins to generate ever more series of
meta-writers, meta-dramas, meta-commentaries until one has what is basicall=
y
the long glorious history of the productions of Shakespeare's Richard the
Third and their myriad spinoffs, including Johnny Rotten copying Laurence
Olivier's Richard in the film version for his creation of the character and
existence as a performer on stage of--Johnny Rotten, who in his turn is
ranting and attacking the Queen.

This theatricality of a writing which makes use of appropriations and
translations (including invented ones) means that the "author" does not
"die" but instead becomes an actor, in which the presence of other voices
begins to issue through the throat and the writing of "some one else" to
come from the hands.   The actor whom is the role that the writer has
become, speaks lines which are--whose?--The writer's?  the actor's?  the
role's?  And out of these emerges a writing which is a fiction which is at
the same time real, or a reality which is fictional, and al the while is
performing an activity which is a writing, a gestural, visceral, sonic and
visual action writing which may in fact exist "nowhere at all" but as the
non-writings of a non-writer who regards thinking and writing as the same,
just as imagined writing may exist in a sphere in which it has no need of
being "written down," as it enjoys in fact the freedom of it's not existing
on the page, but in the "else wheres.".

When Bartleby says "I would prefer not to" and instead stands staring at th=
e
blank view through his window of a very close pressed wall of the building
opposite--is it into these elsewheres that his writing now is being done?

So it is that a personage like my "El Colonel" and Spicer's Lorca, and
Yasusada's Spicer as well as the Yasusada created by the reader out of the
accoutrements that are provided for the acting out of the role--so it is
that these "non-existent" writers mingle with actual writers who are
actually dead, in a theater in which ghosts are lovers and fictional
non-ghosts consort with ghosts and the action of the writing is THE LIVING
of that being that one is to think of as either "the author" or "the death
of the author author."  For it is not death, but dispersal across, through,
within, and away from writing itself that is the action of the being
formerly known as "the author."

Writing has lives of its own in which the writer may find encounters with
it, that outside which now and then bumps into him or her, and then, after =
a
bit, takes off again.  Or an outside which is found, hidden in plain
site/sight/cite all around one, that writing which is continually alive and
changing, moving, at once fugitive and glimpsed by, as Robert Smithson call=
s
it, "the artist's glance," which can be a work as real as any object, yet
not exist except in the time and the "art of looking" of the artist. For
once it becomes an object, then the artist is "signing over" the time and
art of looking as a possesion in which someone else "owns the art" and in a
subtle or not so subtle way,  also "owns the artist."

The real death of the author may then be the sense that exists at present o=
f
the author, a being tied down by legal contracts to a name, an identity car=
d
number, an address, a telephone, a place and status within such and such
community of other authors.

It is this death which a writer may well choose to "prefer not to" be part
of, and so find in a "fugitive" existence the ever chaning words and lines
of a lexicon which cannot be fixed, nor colonized, nor turned into yet
another copyrighted name plated representation of themselves, all ready to
charge off to court to protect a name attached to a function which they may
at the same time profess to desire the death of.

     President Reagan, the Great Communicator, was in his own way an
interesting example of a collector of quotations with an ear and  eye to
creating his own form of "ideal language," one which has proved to be one o=
f
the most radical in its effects  of modern times.  Reagan loved quotations,
and his bedside reading consisted of a single colossal tome of nothing but
quotations, organized for use on any occasion imaginable and many , one
imagines, not yet imagined, but that one should be prepared for, after all,
as The Great Communicator.

Having been an actor, a president of the Screen Actors Guild, and a long
time pitchman for Westinghouse and GE, as well as a radio announcer and tv
celebrity both as actor and advertiser, Reagan had no problem at all
memorizing hunks of quotations, plagiarized and appropriated lines and bits
of speeches, and "was never at a loss for words,"  a favorite technique
being to tell some ancient joke or story "as though for the first time," so
that it's being a quotation was not even noticed. In this way, he appeared
to be an alert and quick-on-his-feet-thinker though in fact he was just
pulling rabbits out of his well stocked hat.

Reagan's cheerful attitude to taking away the meanings of lines and
replacing them with the same words, only now heard as his own, reached a
moment of triumph in his appropriating the anti-Vietnam War song "Born in
the USA' as his own campaign song in 1984.  Suddenly, the verses disappeare=
d
and all one really heard were those endlessly repeated choruses of "Born in
the USA, Born in the USA" as though that was all that mattered.  And in
cynical way, he was right--after all the song was made for a movie and
appeared long after the actual War, so how it could literally be "an
anti-Vietnam War song?"  Reagan's appropriation in a sense exposed the
song's appropriation of the emotions of another time and another person, an=
d
so the Reagan version had as much "validity" as the original did. And, it
being a song for a movie, who better to make use of it than an old movie
actor, one who had actually appeared in war movies, if not the actual war,
unlike the song's author, who had done neither.

And Reagan even quoted in Russian, with translation--the famous "trust but
verify" "Russian proverb" he had learned from his buddy "Mr. Gorbachev."  A=
t
one point, in a pure unadulterated paroxysm of patriotism, he forgot himsel=
f
and recounted his "war memories"--actually scenes from a war film he had
played in. In a sense, to show the "reality" of his emotions, he was
"quoting from memory" a "real war scene" in which he had acted competently
enough to convince himself that he had actually been in the war.  In this
way, quoting from his roles allowed him  to create a non-existent biography
which al the same was "documented on celluloid,"  that could be edited into
various versions of his official "biopic."

In Poe's brief "sketch" written to accompany an illustrated plate, entitled
"Morning on the Wissahicon," (a forerunner of Reagan's "New Morning in
America" as already a "Mourning on the Wissihicon)--a traveller takes a
jaunt down the Wissihicaon and discovers unexpectedly, so close to the
metropolis of Philadelphia, a wild and savage remnant of an America already
thought to be long past, and but the figments and shards of a former dream.
He sees an Indian in a wild overgrowth of unspoiled natural landscape, and
as he drifts by the dramatic scene, there even appears a a magnificent and
authentic American deer--a sort of proto--"Deer Hunter" moment in which the
marvelling traveler is confirmed in his belief that at last he has found th=
e
old, the real America, of the wilderness and "savages," and the untamed wil=
d
life and untrimmed flora of his "native land."
       Yet, the traveller later learns, all of this has been an elaborate
and beautifully staged simulacra, for a wealthy Englishman has purchased th=
e
former Colonial landscape, and populated it with a servant dressed and made
up as an Indian, let the flora go carelessly to seed, and provide the whole
as a topping to the cake, a domesticated deer who is able to pose as a wild
one for the passersby of a Sunday.  Already a "quotation" of what had been =
a
stock vision of the "old America" in all its "savage splendour" has replace=
d
the original with a copy which "outshines" as it were not only the long
vanished original, but has also made, on is certain, the old real estate
greatly increase in value by looking so like what it had replaced in terms
of what had been thought to be along lost memory with a Brand new and vivid
recreation posing as indeed "the reality of today."

         Poe's Englishman thus has accomplished already the creating of an
"ideal language and landscape" made entirely of quotations, and for Poe, th=
e
"mourning" in this "morning" is that the morning is in a sense not yet over
with and it has already been replaced by a quotation of itself, which will
"outlive" the former and so in a sense give cause, if one recalls it at all=
,
a "mourning" for the "morning on the Wissihicon which now no longer exists
except as indeed an ideal language and landscape "in quotation."

The further "mourning" is that the English, who had been the former and for
a while defeated Colonial Power, have now wrested away what had been known
of as an "American original" and turned it into an English owned and
recolonized landscape preserved as a copy of the vanished original.

At the time that Poe began writing, ruins were all the rage, due in good
part to Gothic and Romantic literature from Europe--the kind of literature
and ruins Benjamin was later to write his now famous unpublished thesis on.
Americans were in a state of anxiety, as their country seemingly had
produced no "real ruins."  Poe--who had attended school five years abroad i=
n
Scotland--had seen "real ruins" and as he replied to one critic who accused
him of writing in the manner of the Germans of the time--"Terror is not of
Germany, but of the soul."  Having witnessed the decomposition and descent
into ruins via disease of his dying mother, dying older brother and then
dying wife, Poe realized that the the lack of "real ruins" are, like
Emerson's Nature--"the blank and ruin we see in Nature is within our
eye"--is not a lack at all but instead the blindness to what is in front of
one--the decomposition and decay at the core of being, no matter how "new."


In his "Philosophy of Composition," Poe constructs an impeccably rational
method by which he has gone about composing his poem "The Raven."  No
"romantic ruins" or frenzy inspired him, no "inspiration," but, instead, a
kind of calculating feat of engineering brought to bear on the decompositio=
n
of the very thing that has constructed the poem--the rational, the logical,
the "constructive" mind.  The use of quotation passes from humans to a
bird--"quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'"  The bird may even be a copy of a
bird, a mechanical bird whose cries are repeated by virtue of a timing
mechanism triggered by the last lines of the verse preceding its next
outburst.  Or they may indeed be those of a "real bird," "quoting"
"nevermore," a phrase which plunges the student in the poem into one of
those ever deepening and decomposing morasses of the soul which Poe depicts
also in the guise of decomposing bodies and languages also,  which devolve
into  black birds' cries (perhaps "quothing the Raven" itself--??!!) as in
The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym.

Poe, with his rationally constructed tales in which decomposition and
irrationality begin to "take over" and Burroughs with his fugitive language=
s
whose words change their meanings frequently not only in time--from week to
week or day to day if need be-- but also vary from place to place along the
trail of the outlaw addict, evidence a yearning for a language which will
elude the colonization process of appropriation and quotation.  For
Dubuffet, the "way out" of this nightmare in the "asphyxiating culture" of
the art world was Art Brut as he originally found it and conceived of
it--that is, Dubuffet recognized its existence there, well having the
honesty himself as an artist to know that he himself might learn from these
"Raw" artists while not being one himself.

That is, not that there will be an "authorial self" who is "original" but
that there may  exist "languages" and realms of" communications" in and
among and through  which  the possibility of a continually "living" yet
"invisible" writing is "on the move," while behind it are the deposits of
its shed skins, its discarded, outdated notations, to be picked up on as
"news" and "clues" so as to distract and confuse those would-be
appropriators and translators of a writing which does not want to be read,
and so creates "fakes" of its non-self in order to provide "cover" for its
ever elusive voyages, fictions to amuse itself as it observes the futile
hunters continually be led round and round in circles, deciphering non-sign=
s
as signs and elaborate scrawls as "lucid notations" of a "lost language" or
of a "new language" which they alone will become the possessors of the
secrets of, the sole appropriators and translators of, the alpha and omega
of a literature which now is thought to "belong to history and civilization=
"
and which instead is simply an empty wooden horse, a decoy duck, while
somewhere, elsewhere, the writing leads lives of its own.

(Note: I just found Wyston Curnow's question re a genealogy of the
appropriation use of today--

the issue of appropriation, as noted, begins to change with the introductio=
n
and spread of copyright laws,  as with the acceleration of the production o=
f
copies in themselves--
Benjamin formulates his questions re "The Work of Art in the Age of
Mechanical Reproduction"  close to a hundred years after Poe has begun doin=
g
so.  Hawthorne, writing in the 1840's roughly, in The House of Seven Gables=
,
already has as a major figure a Daguerreotypist who provides, along with th=
e
narrator, commentaries on the art of the photograph in comparison with that
of painting--that is, in terms of their status as not solely copies of
persons and scenes, but also as methods directed towards revealing what is
otherwise hidden to the eye of an observer.  The "composition" of a
daguerreotype then, becomes a form of decomposition of not only a painted
image, but as well of the "image of the person" themselves--"revealing"
aspects hidden not only to others but also perhaps to themselves.  As a
"reversed mirror image" in a sense, it gives an oddly "corrected" image of
that image which one had previously supposed one was seeing as others do.

The very decomposition of the House itself becomes as it were a method of
"letting in more light" via the cracked and fissured surfaces, which is the
"pencil of light" with which the camera writes into existence a new method
of representing things not only singly, but serially, or, as in the famous
mirror scenes in Citizen Kane and The Lady from Shanghai--an endless series
of mirrorings of the self trapped in the light of the moment which is
turning it into the past as the figure moves before the --and into--the hal=
l
of mirrors.

One might begin with an examination of many of the texts of the "Classic
American Literature" (D.H Lawrence) as the first literature to in a sense
compose via decomposition and in so doing decompose the "future" of its own
literature before it has happened.  (Rather than being a deconstruction
avant la lettre, as Poe's work has furnished examinations for, it is a
decomposition of the work of time on things before they have begun to
exist.)

One finds that already a century and a half ago and more, there already
exist in this Classic Literature the contemporary the issues of copying,
appropriation, translations, quotations, cataloging, "secret messages,"
"messages in code," the examination of handwriting itself as a method of
literary "criticism," the centrality of the role of death, the appearance o=
f
"intelligent machines" and "psychic communications" as a form of scientific
possibility--the ghostly, the after-effects existences, of unknown writings
and languages which haunt the forests and wildernesses, and as well are
still living among them in many vast areas, the complimentary American form=
s
of Gigantism (Walt Whitman, Paul Bunyan, Earthworks) and the Minimalist
(Emily Dickinson)--as well as the use throughout American popular art of th=
e
copy of an object to represent the trade or concept for which the object's
copy is supposed to stand.  (The vast and eccentric systems of signs used i=
n
the US a hundred fifty years ago are basically the creation of a three
dimensional sculptural-visual poetry of incredible variety and ingenuity.
In a sense, it is a writing for persons who may not actually know how to
read--in any language--or simply in English--)

One of the aspects of this writing is that it in ways is more related to Ar=
t
Brut and Burroughs' fugitive languages, than to to the more confining and
constrained of the commonly in use American examples of today, as it sees
and makes use of everything as writing.  This is neither "the world as text=
"
nor "the text as world" or today's rather fundamentalist and curiously
Puritan conception of a "material word" on the page, with the attendant
"sacredness of the book, the text," but something blasphemous (Melville to
Hawthorne,  on completing Moby Dick:  "I have written a wicked book and am
as clean as the Lamb")- --that is, that the world is alive with writings
which are moving and changing at every moment, and themselves exist on
living beings as well as on insentient "materials."  (Melville also writes
to Hawthorne, that the very hand which lifts now the pen that it has just
written with, is not the same hand that just formed the last completed
letter of script, and will not be the same as the one that writes the
next--)

Tattoos, scrimshaw, the Scarlet Letter, the letters of the words of an
unknown language  carved into the black rock of an island, (in Pym; Robert
Smithson wrote of these as "perfect proto Earthwords" for a new art
criticism")--the disappearing inks and concealed treasure maps, the Goldbug
and its revelations--as well as the "readings" of Nature by Thoreau and
Emerson, and the observations as signs in turn of the "Leaves of Grass"
which are the tongues of the sleepers below ground, and, beyond that, "the
untold, the unwritten war" that "Will Never Be Written in the Books" of
Whitman's "Specimen Days, or the insects and flowers in Emily Dickinson
which form the kind of private language which she uses to "but cross the
room and be in the Spice Islands" (the continual voyage theme)--all of thes=
e
are writings which extend writing far beyond the "normaliiizing" convention=
s
of the limits of the page--

This vision of a language which is continually in movement, continually
changing, concealing itself, reappearing, being thrown overboard, or bobbin=
g
about as the carved coffin bearing the absent Queequeg's script and the sol=
e
survivor and author to be of the tale of the late  Pequod--is itself from a
period in which the American language  was in flux, not yet standardized an=
d
fixed into the defined and set stone of Webster's. A chaos in spelling,
punctuation and grammar was perfectly acceptable, as were the wildly varyin=
g
degrees of abilities of readers to decipher the riot of signs and symbols
running amok all around them, and so was a sense of writing as something
alive and and unfixed, nomadic and tending, like Art Brut and the addict's
fugitive Jargons, towards an anarchy and "Civil Disobedience" which have
become increasingly tamed, toned down and timid.

For example, consider that today, a work of appropriation in a conceptual
sense is proffered as that of "unoriginality, copying" and the "author" thu=
s
no longer "exists" except as a functionary, a filer of data, a sorter of
files.  This is precisely the work which Bartleby is assigned to, and which
he one day simply decides that he would "prefer not to" do anymore.

Bartleby's act of Disobedience he pays for by being incarcerated in the
tombs, there to die, refusing all the while to acept anything offered out o=
f
a sense of obligation by the employer who had put him there in the first
place, as a last resort against homelessness.

In a peculiar way, may one not say that Bartleby is a kind of "political
prisoner," (civil disobediance since 9/11 carrying much heavier potential
penalties)  in the sense that he will no longer carry out the contemporary
(today's) idea of what it means to be an author-cum-death-of-the-author?
Instead, he would "prefer not to" be a writer who writes as the death of th=
e
author as it exists in the conceptual formulation of copyist and filer, eve=
n
if rejecting this method of writing-as-the-death-of-the-author means the
loss of his freedom, and following that, of his life.

In short, Bartleby would "prefer not to" BE a "death-of-the-author-author"
but instead simply to die.

here are some examples of a few of the possiblities themselves so myriad an=
d
ever expanding of the little i suggest  in the above

A Time for Prose

Subjectivity and the Present in Experimental Narrative Writing

In =93The Sutured Subject,=94 a new essay from the acclaimed novelist =20=

Gail Scott, we are given a clear sense of the predicament of =20
experimental narrative writing today: =93Virginia Woolf said nearly a =20=

century ago that new sentences were needed to contain new stories,=94 =20=

we are reminded. But at the same time, Scott says, =93so many good =20
stories today seem told in the mode of yesterday=92s news.=94

Playing a key role in Scott=92s essay is Walter Benjamin=92s angel of =20=

history, forever propelled forward while gazing back at the past, and =20=

employed here to illuminate a critical issue for writers of =20
sentences: subjectivity. =93The sentence, like the angel, expresses =20
both a glancing back, a summary, and, if allowed to play, to torque, =20
to break, in shape and in relation, a ride over the dynamic present. =20
Crucial to this operation of expressing jetztzeit in prose is the =20
work of subverting the singular writing subject=97the angel is both =20
subject and object=97allowing in other voices intervening from both the =20=

past and the present.=94
A Time for Prose, a special event sponsored by the CUNY Graduate =20
Center Poetics Group, will address the present of avant-garde prose, =20
along with essential related questions: why experimental prose seems =20
eternally suspended between narrative and language, between affect =20
and the social, between history and the present. Montreal novelist =20
and essayist Gail Scott will present "The Sutured Subject," followed =20
by responses from New York writers Douglas A. Martin and Rachel =20
Levitsky. The conversation will address the influences on =20
contemporary prose of such writers as Victor Shklovsky, Kathy Acker, =20
Ren=E9e Gladman, Taylor Brady, the New Narrative group (Robert Gl=FCck, =20=

Camille Roy, Dodie Bellamy and Kevin Killian), and the Language poets.

David,

Just a quick response to your post before I read it more carefully and
comment on it in greater detail later:
I understand very well your seeing the possibility of exploitation within
the idea of appropriation. There is no question historically that has
happened often enough, erasing the "original" in the process.

I am referring to something quite different. Do not forget that in his
matrix of "translation" and "ideal language" Benjamin sees translation as a
"loose gown" or a collection of shards/fragments. Dissolution, particularly
of a close system, is at the heart of his concept of tramnslation. In *Afte=
r
Lorca* Spicer picks that aspect of Benjamin's thought. (I have an essay
exactly on that relation between Benjamin and Spicer that can be found on
line in Lucas's Cypherjournal website.

On the other hand, I do believe that every translation, in my sense of the
word, starts with a "misreading" which cracks open the original by
fragmenting it. The target language also must "misread" itself cracking
itself open. This way both languages undergo transformations, creating a
synthesis by joining in the space of ideal language,

What translation does is to explore, crack open *latent* possibilities in
both languages which the close system of each suppresses. Translation
becomes a linguistic act of liberation. Here is the translation paradox: a
translation misreads, but must/can never lie about the original. Misreading=
s
will only reveal, liberate what is inherent in them. That is how they becom=
e
the very reverse of exploitation.

"Translation is foreignness in a language bending to contain its weight."

Ciao,

Murat

support the artists.

Poetry and Prints is an ongoing collaboration between Spudnik Press
and House Press. It is a series of approachable, unpretentious, and
progressive poetry readings combined with visual art and live music in
a way that cultivates interesting and meaningful interactions among
artists working in different disciplines, and our community.

Hot Whiskey Press was a contributor in the past, but recently
relocated to Prague.

Poets:
Melissa Severin, Chicago, IL
Roberto Harrison, Milwaukee, WI
Aaron Lowinger, Buffalo, NY

The Scott Tuma and Mike Weis Duo

Prints:
"Not Recent Work", by Angee Lennard, Director of Spudnik Press. Angee
will be going to go out on a limb and showing her own work. She'll be
putting together an installation of older projects as a stepping stone
to creating some new work.

Melissa Severin earned her MFA in Poetry from New England College and
is managing editor for Switchback Books. Her poems are forthcoming or
have appeared in Moonlit, The Cultural Society, Ectoplasmic
Necropolis, and Sawbuck. Brute Fact, her first chapbook, is available

Enemy Rumor reading series. A collection of his journal entries and
drawings, Ineffable Isthmus, was shown at Woodland Pattern in the
winter of 2007/2008.

"All poetics is local," writes Michael Kelleher in response to Aaron
Lowinger's Front Park poems. From Buffalo's Psych Ward Flats he writes
at the ecstasy of despair and the irony of joy. Recent author of
chapbook Open Night Poems, about which Michael Basinski exclaims "The
poet is in love and singing it poetry and finds all the silly and
stupid and mundane things terrific! And finds all the important and
special unique love things terrific! And terrific they are and the
mind wanderings and celebration of imagination terrific and taxi cabs!
And corn! And etc. of the city and as Bard of Buffalo!!"

Dear Murat--

Many thanks for your response.

First--
Spicer's work, like a series i've done--is "After"--which is to say--not a
translation.

I do not know really, but as far as I am aware, the Spicer "After Lorca"
aren't translations at all, nor are my "After Rimbaud's Illuminations"--
nor would be Yasusada's "After Spicer"--

they are works which are inspired by aspects of the originals, with which
one lives intensely for a period of time, whether themselves (originals) as
in fact already translations, or one's own readings in the originals,
without having the desire to translate them, but rather use them as a means
to show one's love, respect, thanks, to the other poet, and at the same
time, launch what one has been inspired by into the trajectories of one's
own work, life, spirit etc--

I agree with you about the form of translation which Benjamin writes of.  M=
y
point is that in thing as complex and myriad faceted--or hydra headed!--as
translation and appropriation, rather than decide on solely one approach at
the expense of investigating several or many as possible of the others, is
to in a sense make too narrow an aperture for, my one so put it,
"Illumination."

Translations can lie as easily as any other form of writing--a translator
knows the correct meaning, and, not liking it, as it does not fit in with
the "message"which the translator wants the text to bear--ignores that and
instead chooses another word, set of words, phrases, etc--and so alters
completely the meaning of the original.

As in the kinds of commentaries and reserachs to which Barry alluded, i've
spent eons digging about in various series of translations, footnotes,
commentaries, old dictionaries and so forth, on the trail of finding out no=
t
so much what actually is or is not the "original" meaning --of a poem, word=
,
sign--but to have better understanding, still all too small a one, of how
through time and across various manipulations, revisions, commentaries,
controversies and theses, a poem, a line, a word may have been treated or
mis- or dis-treated---via translation.

A great deal of the "information" that is transmitted around the world is
made up of deliberately dis-translated texts, speeches, sound bytes--in
order to foment strife, or to promote various forms of insidious illusions
in order to create fear and hate.

The same may easily be done with appropriation--in my first letter i put
forth some of the uncountable reasons that are positive and why i use such
methods myself and study the works of others who do.

A very good way to study appropriation and also various methods of
translation is via collage, forms of montage as serial panels (which in
painting is very ancient method)--and also simply collecting the things one
finds on a walk and making an arrangement of more of these.

Immediately one sees how much may be changed, and so radically, by a few
simple shifts in the order of things, or which elements are contingent to
others, which dropped out, which cropped and so on--

Using not all that many images and torn fotos, words, letters, one may
create a series which is a form of cinema--
or, on a single page, may take the form of a one page movie--a
simultaneously presented series which one "sees" and "reads" not linearly,
but as a series of linked associations, leaps and intuitions.

The reason that being aware of as many ways as one can of how these methods
are used is that they do not apply "simply to art and poetry," but as well
to the way in which the world one lives in is constructed.  The "reality"
one is offered via texts, screens, sound, images, video,film, signs on the
street, is already a series on a gigantic scale of cut-ups, edits, montages=
,
collages, dis and regular translations, faked and real events and texts,
images and runaway hearsay and rumor spread at instant speeds across the
world, involving in next to no time at all millions of people.

At every step of the way one is "hailed," to use Althusser's term--(and
quite literally on our street where step someone is hailing you--with dope
or sex,or a person'd sure could use  a smoke or some change or simply to
tell you about the demons that are possessing them--or the Lord--or
ghosts--or the Blues--

As a writer, "intrepid reporter," painter, collage maker-for me---all these
are elements, materials, and they arrive continually.  Among the aspects
which are endlessly interesting are the ways in which words are used to mak=
e
use of other people--and at the same time have them think that this is not
so.  Of course, in listening and paying attention, one oneself is making us=
e
of whatever comes along!  To me what are ceaselessly amazing are the
paradoxes of events, words, signs, images--how if one looks and listens fro=
m
one vantage, things appear to be one way--and then to shift the head
slightly to the left--and see and hear how things then appear and are heard=
.
And to continue doing so--toh get a smal sense of how much can be chnaged b=
y
just the smallest shifts--

Why is it that there must be one single way to view things?  From each
person one may hear or not a differing reason why they have chosen to
believe in one particular way as opposed to or another.  This happens with
oneself--one begins to find out how many things one had taken as truths
which are and  were not so at all.  And if one sought the reason why at som=
e
point one had taken them to be so--all too often it turned out to be
something far more arbitrary than expected!  A lot of the time one is
basically unlearning a great deal of the nonsense one has in one's head.

Now, if one begins with a certain idea in mind of a doctrine of the methods
one is using--then one may develop a blind spot to those things which do no=
t
fit the pattern, nor "back up" one's point of view, which is to be as
faithful as possible to the methodology which one believes in.

it is mysterious beyond measure how many things that people criticize
fiction readers for--the willing suspension of disbelief--they themselves
accept without question from so and so or such and such, as though coming
from them it must be true.

In a sense, this method of beginning from the point of view of one doctrine
only is a way to predetermine an outcome of the direction in which one is
going with what one is working with.  One arrives where one expected, and s=
o
this proves that if one sets others out on this way they also will.
According to so and so who first perfected the method, of course.

The problem is some people are not that good at following directions and
others could care less and improvise along the way and others still yet
violently oppose so and so who drew up the map.

This is why one finds the endless series of commentaries and footnotes,
disputes and controversies--al those supplemental elements which multiply
the one orginal point of view--via all sorts of mistakes, miscues, missed
turns and out right oppostion.

This is still the approach of a kind of single-subject author.  Why not,
then, begin instead from a non-doctrine or methodology and simply begin to
examine in different modes of writing and in the voices and images of
differeing beings within or that one knows via observation--and so to trave=
l
into this other way--unknown as yet--to see where it may be going?

One may improvise, act the part--use whatever way one likes--

In a way, over the letters i've written here, one may see that several
series of points of view appear--and several voices enter in--in order to
keep the way open, the movement continuing--

If one is not "one author"--but many, and none of them  necessarily stable,
fixed, either, but each one having themselves many within them--

Many things one may never have imagined, nor been able to express as well a=
t
all as this found article one could never have imagined-- these found
things--words, images, articles, clips--which one appropriates--to stand fo=
r
themselves--in this flow of voices, writings--images--
open to things again that are uncanny--perhaps familiar and at the same tim=
e
unknown--or perhaps entirely new, though with stil some odd hint of a
previous non encounter deja vu occurring in the background, like the hummin=
g
of a fly in a room on the other side of a screen with holes torn in it--

At one moment to be a Benjaminian translator, at the next to say one is an
agent of some agency, MEMRI, or the like , which is going to set about
dis-translating the same piece of writing.

After all, mutiny may occur aboard the ship--and the captain be
overthrown--and so another method introduced--piratical--or peaceful--or
simply partying--


Appropriation does not only have to do with the taking of land, of
possessions, of ideas, of a culture--but also of the soul of a
being--"possession" is not only 9 tenths of the law--but a form of
"spiritual possession"--to seize upon the spirit of a being and suck it
out--to take a foto and steal it--or like my Mohawk in-law, to know the if
one heard her voice on the phone, that meant the person who was not there
listening would be a spirit stealing her soul--so never to use the
telephone--or have a foto taken--or sign any documents--

this is the fugitive aspect of words which change continually that Burrough=
s
writes or, or the element of Art Brut so admired by Dubuffet--that Smithson
writes of with "an artist's glance"--being able to make a work which is not
an object to be possessed--

There are elements and aspects of writing, of "art" that do not want to be
known, don't care to be--possessed--do not want to be named--

And yet to exist--

to have lives of their own outside --

so many lives lived in an instant and one is forced into a strait jacket of
words--

to have a freedom of that life's own--
without anyone or anything "liberating " it--

Sometimes it is not that one "misread" something--but that one read it all
too well--

(and perhaps wants or wanted no part of it--)

actaully here ia little parable that is interesting:

i read of a baseball player who early in the season was traded from one tea=
m
to another, "for a player to be named later."

eventually, "later" came, nearing the trading deadline late in the season--
and who would be sent to the other team as the player to be named later--

why, none other than the same player who had been traded away!

the only time in baseball history that a trade indisputably worked out to
being "equal" for the team making the trade-

an interesting event--to be traded for oneself!

as yogi berra, the great hall of fame catcher, 3 time MVP, former yankee
manager and famous American improvisationsalist on the mother tongue  told
the  graduating class of a  college in his native new jersey--

when you come to a fork in the road--take it!

which is what one essays to do in examing these questions--
take care at the fork in the road and the fork in the tongue!
and listen closely and learn--

Spicer's Lorca includes many translations of actual Lorca poems, mixed in w=
ith ones that are not translations at all. Someone who knows Spanish can te=
ll us how free or not the translations are, but when I compared some of the=
m to other "straight" translations that have been published, they seemed pr=
etty similar.=0A=0A=0A=0A________________________________=0AFrom: David Chi=

irst--=0ASpicer's work, like a series i've done--is "After"--which is to sa=
y--not a=0Atranslation.=0A=0AI do not know really, but as far as I am aware=
, the Spicer "After Lorca"=0Aaren't translations at all, nor are my "After =
Rimbaud's Illuminations"--=0Anor would be Yasusada's "After Spicer"--=0A=0A=
they are works which are inspired by aspects of the originals, with which=
=0Aone lives intensely for a period of time, whether themselves (originals)=
 as=0Ain fact already translations, or one's own readings in the originals,=
=0Awithout having the desire to translate them, but rather use them as a me=
ans=0Ato show one's love, respect, thanks, to the other poet, and at the sa=
me=0Atime, launch what one has been inspired by into the trajectories of on=
e's=0Aown work, life, spirit etc--=0A=0AI agree with you about the form of =
translation which Benjamin writes of.  My=0Apoint is that in thing as compl=
ex and myriad faceted--or hydra headed!--as=0Atranslation and appropriation=
, rather than decide on solely one approach at=0Athe expense of investigati=
ng several or many as possible of the others, is=0Ato in a sense make too n=
arrow an aperture for, my one so put it,=0A"Illumination."=0A=0ATranslation=
s can lie as easily as any other form of writing--a translator=0Aknows the =
correct meaning, and, not liking it, as it does not fit in with=0Athe "mess=
age"which the translator wants the text to bear--ignores that and=0Ainstead=
 chooses another word, set of words, phrases, etc--and so alters=0Acomplete=
ly the meaning of the original.=0A=0AAs in the kinds of commentaries and re=
serachs to which Barry alluded, i've=0Aspent eons digging about in various =
series of translations, footnotes,=0Acommentaries, old dictionaries and so =
forth, on the trail of finding out not=0Aso much what actually is or is not=
 the "original" meaning --of a poem, word,=0Asign--but to have better under=
standing, still all too small a one, of how=0Athrough time and across vario=
us manipulations, revisions, commentaries,=0Acontroversies and theses, a po=
em, a line, a word may have been treated or=0Amis- or dis-treated---via tra=
nslation.=0A=0AA great deal of the "information" that is transmitted around=
 the world is=0Amade up of deliberately dis-translated texts, speeches, sou=
nd bytes--in=0Aorder to foment strife, or to promote various forms of insid=
ious illusions=0Ain order to create fear and hate.=0A=0AThe same may easily=
 be done with appropriation--in my first letter i put=0Aforth some of the u=
ncountable reasons that are positive and why i use such=0Amethods myself an=
d study the works of others who do.=0A=0AA very good way to study appropria=
tion and also various methods of=0Atranslation is via collage, forms of mon=
tage as serial panels (which in=0Apainting is very ancient method)--and als=
o simply collecting the things one=0Afinds on a walk and making an arrangem=
ent of more of these.=0A=0AImmediately one sees how much may be changed, an=
d so radically, by a few=0Asimple shifts in the order of things, or which e=
lements are contingent to=0Aothers, which dropped out, which cropped and so=
 on--=0A=0AUsing not all that many images and torn fotos, words, letters, o=
ne may=0Acreate a series which is a form of cinema--=0Aor, on a single page=
, may take the form of a one page movie--a=0Asimultaneously presented serie=
s which one "sees" and "reads" not linearly,=0Abut as a series of linked as=
sociations, leaps and intuitions.=0A=0AThe reason that being aware of as ma=
ny ways as one can of how these methods=0Aare used is that they do not appl=
y "simply to art and poetry," but as well=0Ato the way in which the world o=
ne lives in is constructed.  The "reality"=0Aone is offered via texts, scre=
ens, sound, images, video,film, signs on the=0Astreet, is already a series =
on a gigantic scale of cut-ups, edits, montages,=0Acollages, dis and regula=
r translations, faked and real events and texts,=0Aimages and runaway hears=
ay and rumor spread at instant speeds across the=0Aworld, involving in next=
 to no time at all millions of people.=0A=0AAt every step of the way one is=
 "hailed," to use Althusser's term--(and=0Aquite literally on our street wh=
ere step someone is hailing you--with dope=0Aor sex,or a person'd sure coul=
d use  a smoke or some change or simply to=0Atell you about the demons that=
 are possessing them--or the Lord--or=0Aghosts--or the Blues--=0A=0AAs a wr=
iter, "intrepid reporter," painter, collage maker-for me---all these=0Aare =
elements, materials, and they arrive continually.  Among the aspects=0Awhic=
h are endlessly interesting are the ways in which words are used to make=0A=
use of other people--and at the same time have them think that this is not=
=0Aso.  Of course, in listening and paying attention, one oneself is making=
 use=0Aof whatever comes along!  To me what are ceaselessly amazing are the=
=0Aparadoxes of events, words, signs, images--how if one looks and listens =
from=0Aone vantage, things appear to be one way--and then to shift the head=
=0Aslightly to the left--and see and hear how things then appear and are he=
ard.=0AAnd to continue doing so--toh get a smal sense of how much can be ch=
naged by=0Ajust the smallest shifts--=0A=0AWhy is it that there must be one=
 single way to view things?  From each=0Aperson one may hear or not a diffe=
ring reason why they have chosen to=0Abelieve in one particular way as oppo=
sed to or another.  This happens with=0Aoneself--one begins to find out how=
 many things one had taken as truths=0Awhich are and  were not so at all.  =
And if one sought the reason why at some=0Apoint one had taken them to be s=
o--all too often it turned out to be=0Asomething far more arbitrary than ex=
pected!  A lot of the time one is=0Abasically unlearning a great deal of th=
e nonsense one has in one's head.=0A=0ANow, if one begins with a certain id=
ea in mind of a doctrine of the methods=0Aone is using--then one may develo=
p a blind spot to those things which do not=0Afit the pattern, nor "back up=
" one's point of view, which is to be as=0Afaithful as possible to the meth=
odology which one believes in.=0A=0Ait is mysterious beyond measure how man=
y things that people criticize=0Afiction readers for--the willing suspensio=
n of disbelief--they themselves=0Aaccept without question from so and so or=
 such and such, as though coming=0Afrom them it must be true.=0A=0AIn a sen=
se, this method of beginning from the point of view of one doctrine=0Aonly =
is a way to predetermine an outcome of the direction in which one is=0Agoin=
g with what one is working with.  One arrives where one expected, and so=0A=
this proves that if one sets others out on this way they also will.=0AAccor=
ding to so and so who first perfected the method, of course.=0A=0AThe probl=
em is some people are not that good at following directions and=0Aothers co=
uld care less and improvise along the way and others still yet=0Aviolently =
oppose so and so who drew up the map.=0A=0AThis is why one finds the endles=
s series of commentaries and footnotes,=0Adisputes and controversies--al th=
ose supplemental elements which multiply=0Athe one orginal point of view--v=
ia all sorts of mistakes, miscues, missed=0Aturns and out right oppostion.=
=0A=0AThis is still the approach of a kind of single-subject author.  Why n=
ot,=0Athen, begin instead from a non-doctrine or methodology and simply beg=
in to=0Aexamine in different modes of writing and in the voices and images =
of=0Adiffereing beings within or that one knows via observation--and so to =
travel=0Ainto this other way--unknown as yet--to see where it may be going?=
=0A=0AOne may improvise, act the part--use whatever way one likes--=0A=0AIn=
 a way, over the letters i've written here, one may see that several=0Aseri=
es of points of view appear--and several voices enter in--in order to=0Akee=
p the way open, the movement continuing--=0A=0AIf one is not "one author"--=
but many, and none of them  necessarily stable,=0Afixed, either, but each o=
ne having themselves many within them--=0A=0AMany things one may never have=
 imagined, nor been able to express as well at=0Aall as this found article =
one could never have imagined-- these found=0Athings--words, images, articl=
es, clips--which one appropriates--to stand for=0Athemselves--in this flow =
of voices, writings--images--=0Aopen to things again that are uncanny--perh=
aps familiar and at the same time=0Aunknown--or perhaps entirely new, thoug=
h with stil some odd hint of a=0Aprevious non encounter deja vu occurring i=
n the background, like the humming=0Aof a fly in a room on the other side o=
f a screen with holes torn in it--=0A=0AAt one moment to be a Benjaminian t=
ranslator, at the next to say one is an=0Aagent of some agency, MEMRI, or t=
he like , which is going to set about=0Adis-translating the same piece of w=
riting.=0A=0AAfter all, mutiny may occur aboard the ship--and the captain b=
e=0Aoverthrown--and so another method introduced--piratical--or peaceful--o=
r=0Asimply partying--=0A=0A=0AAppropriation does not only have to do with t=
he taking of land, of=0Apossessions, of ideas, of a culture--but also of th=
e soul of a=0Abeing--"possession" is not only 9 tenths of the law--but a fo=
rm of=0A"spiritual possession"--to seize upon the spirit of a being and suc=
k it=0Aout--to take a foto and steal it--or like my Mohawk in-law, to know =
the if=0Aone heard her voice on the phone, that meant the person who was no=
t there=0Alistening would be a spirit stealing her soul--so never to use th=
e=0Atelephone--or have a foto taken--or sign any documents--=0A=0Athis is t=
he fugitive aspect of words which change continually that Burroughs=0Awrite=
s or, or the element of Art Brut so admired by Dubuffet--that Smithson=0Awr=
ites of with "an artist's glance"--being able to make a work which is not=
=0Aan object to be possessed--=0A=0AThere are elements and aspects of writi=
ng, of "art" that do not want to be=0Aknown, don't care to be--possessed--d=
o not want to be named--=0A=0AAnd yet to exist--=0A=0Ato have lives of thei=

David,

At the bifurcation they part    Y    one sling, yet    in my heart     one
sling shot.

The word "After" in Spicer's poem does not only mean "in imitation of" or
"in homage to." It also means "in pursuit of; it has a predatory
connotation. In fact, Lorca's reactions from the grave to Spicer's
solicitations is one of annoyance." A true translation is always an act of
violence -loving or otherwise, that is the issue- against the autonomy of
the original. It literally must tear it up -fragment it- to open it up to a
future life, the life of the text. This fragmentation does have the element=
s
of collage. Are you familiar with Eliot Weinberger's essay, "Notes On
Translation" [?] of about fifteen years ago about which Kent Johnson wrote
an article which appears in the last issue of ALTA's *The Translation Revie=
w
*?

In your comments, you focus on what a text loses in translation, through
misreading (intentional or not) what gets silenced . My feeling is you are
particularly thinking of the Guantanamo translations. One should also think
of what it gains: what starts as a "complete," closed text opens and become=
s
a potential one, which is its life through time.

A bad translator sees, detects no resistance in the original. If so, as you
state, the "philosophy" of the translator turns the original into a text
totally in the translator's image. That is an act of exploitation, the very
reverse of what I am talking about. An original resits to be translated.
That's why Benjamin says what gives a text translability is distance. The
translator translates, integrates that distance. That is why a translation
has a tangential relationship to the second language, the distance,
expressed as style, existing as an ideal, a template of potentiality for it=
.

Ciao,

Murat

Dear Wystan:

One of the interesting ways to think of appropriation through time is that
it may often function not as a method of "creating of the previous/with the
previous" something "new," but, instead as a participating in many actions
which involve extension, reframing and as well, not making "fake" or
"artificial" but paradoxically a kind of "return to realism."

For example:  Duchamp takes an object and puts it in an art gallery and
calls it a "ready Made."  (Art off the rack," so to speak, with the "label"
being simply that the artist who chose the object said that is "art."

At the same time, to bring art "down from the high horse of abstraction,"
and "return to the reality at hand," the object itself is "a real object,
straight from the hardware store."

A "real object" becomes "an art object" simply by the moving of it from one
environment (hardware store) to another (art gallery).  Yet the object thus
"transformed" remains the same "real object" and hence it becomes  not art
itself as abstract on the canvas or in a three-D object, or in a text, but
an "abstract transaction" in the mind:  trans---action being the key word,
as both a "transaction" in a commercial terms, and an action "beyond" or
"through and out," a transit.

The effect of the transaction (hopefully) is to be that it sets in action
the realization that art happens in the mind, not only in the object, text,
screen, canvas.

Duchamp said he wanted to make art which contradicted the French idiomatic
phrase "Bete comme un peintre."  (Stupid like a painter--the stereotype of
the painter of genius who is one in painting and/or sculpture, but when it
comes to articulating any thoughts, "is at loss for words." and so appears
to be "stupid like a painter."

In arts of appropriation, one is making use of a preexisting object, text,
fragment, and so the work is anchored in a "reality," a "documentary"
aspect, which is to be played off of, or make a commentary on, the
"fictional" and "artificial" and if such is the case, "faked" aspects of the
work.   In this way, the work can question the nature of the construction of
"reality" as already being being "made" of such a process in itself.

In collage art, the artist is simply doing what is already being done around
them--and commenting on it through re-editing, re-juxtaposing, transports
elements from one realm to another there to mingle with elements taken from
others--Schwitter's method in his collages and Merzbau--Rauschenberg and his
"Combines" and transfer works, etc.  Warhol's Factory production of serial
versions of the same image, replicas of Campbell's Soup Cans, and the whole
Pop Art basis in recycling and reproducing "pop" imagery--treats the image
world, already reproductions, mass productions, as in itself a reality, and
so create the Pop reality which simply recycles itself as an endless system
of production.   These works in a sense are at once "artificial" and "real"
as the reality they are reproducing is an artificial one, in treating it as
real, it becomes again artificial (art) or--in treating it as already
artificial (art) and reproducing it, taking elements fro it, it makes of a
popular "artificiality" and "art artificiality" by the shifting of the
frames from the comic book store or super market to the art gallery.

With writing, for thousands of years most likely, persons have gazed at some
landscape, city scene or sudden movement of the wind in tress and had a line
of poetry come to their mind and/or lips as having "presented this to me
previously."  That is--this scene makes me think of a line of Pindar."  In
this way whole landscapes becomes the sites of tourism for those aficionados
who want to see the "real Wuthering Heights," the places where Ulysses takes
place," the New York of Edith Wharton, or the Paris of Baudelaire.  The
description and associations in writing in a sense create the place from
which they are seen as being created into a place which others "want to go
and see in all its reality," though that reality may have existed quite some
time ago or perhaps just six months ago.  "The scene of the crime," as it
were, to be gawked at and commented on further, with fotos taken and
souvenirs purchased.

(Poe's "Morning on the Wissihcon" describes a proto-version this kind of
literary Disney  'world"--)

A writer like Herodotus is a forerunner of al these things, in that his
Histories include everything--stories told that are fabulous, others that
are "documented," speculations, wild eyed tales of wonders, all manner of
things real, imaginary, fictional, hoaxed, are run togetehr as being simply
what the traveling historian has collected.  In this method of appropriation
what is being accomplished "naturally" by Herodotus is today done as an
attempt to "blur," "transgress" boundaries and dividing lines between
categories, classifications, into such separate things as "fables," "Facts,"
and "hoaxes."    The desire of many "post modern" projects and approaches
is, as Olson had propounded fifty years ago and more, found actually in the
pre-Aristotlean world of a writer like Herodotus, when no such
classificatory systems are being applied.  What is written of today as
"transgressions," was all in a day's life and work for a traveling historian
like Herodotus or those "travel writers" of the early periods of Western
colonialist expansions and explorations.

I keep bringing him up, but Poe is the first American writer to consistently
use methods, let alone invent quite a number of his own, for creating
hybrids of facts, fictions, fakes, hoaxes, "newspaper items," and "detective
stories," one of which, "The Mystery of Marie Roget," was written along side
the actual tabloid sensation mystery of the murder and disappearance of the
body of Mary Rogers, "The Cigar Store Girl."  Via his fictional
ratiocinating "Dupin, Poe wanted to demonstrate that this method would more
effectively, efficiently and correctly solve the crime than the tabloid
accounts of the bumbling methods of the then rather haphazard assemblage of
beings and techniques that was the new York Police force.

(Conan Doyle with his Sherlock Holmes makes use of this inspiration of Poe's
in Sherlock Holmes' always using the London Times as vast treasure trove of
textual evidences and clues.)

One of Poe's great dreams is to find the area of suspension between waking
and dreaming, living and death--and in this manner be at the blurring of all
boundaries--an area i which reality and imagination, fictions and fakes, all
are equally vivid and as it were living-dead.  Having observed the death of
his mother, his brother and his young wife, Poe's desire to as much as
possible suspend the last instants of consciousness before its extinction is
a "rational"desire and need for something that others deem "irrational."
Thus the work of Poe becomes ever more of a series of depictions in which
the ratiocination of the writing "detective" and "mathematician" try to hold
at bay the incoming flood tides of the Others--the living dead, the ghosts,
the hearts beating through floorboards, the journey of Arthur Gordon Pym
through a realm all in Black--Black people, birds, soil, letterings carved
into black rock--and then white--the arrival finally at the edges of the
other side of a printed page from the blackness of letters to its white
spaces--a figure of white that arises out of the whiteness of mists and is
as white as the whiteness of snow.  In effect--a "white out"--the
termination of writing as black notations on white pages and the the
confrontation of a "white on white" aspect at the edges of what is NOT an
erasure--as in Malevich's "White Square on a White Square" which had been
preceded by the "Black Square a Black Square."

In this narrative of Pym's, it is also noted that perhaps the reader wil not
notice at which point the narrative written by Pym stops and that written by
the person who is the editor of the published work begins.  The book is
supplied with an Appendix which in turn throws doubts on who actually did
write the text, and if the editor is telling the truth, or if there is some
other aspect involved, and Pym himself has been perhaps the narrator all
along.

The making ambiguous and mysterious of a fictional account of journey that
is fantastic yet described in the most precise "ship shape" manner and
details, is to further emphasize the idea that there can always be as it
were "updates" on the status of a text and its "authorship."  That is, Poe
is demonstrating that even one's own texts can experience such disputes, as
to what Poe really wrote, what was written by someone else whom he
plagiarized or "borrowed generously from."  In effect, the Appendix is
implying--there can continually be "news flash" updates on the status and
authorship of this text, and basically any other, as al texts participate in
this madcap traversal of exchanges and exchange (stock exchange also).

Again, this method gives Poe the chance to "put off" the idea of their being
"an ending"--in effect the "true story" has not yet been told, and so in the
meantime one will be continually finding "news flashes' which bring one the
latest updates on the Poe-Pym voyages and authorships.

In Pym, the authors--both of them or more--are in a sense playing a game of
jack in the box with what are the various scenes of internment in the
book--the whole tale finds Pym being confined in terribly close quarters, or
in a situation of captivity or near extinction.  In fact, we do  not know as
the book begins whether or not Pym actually survived at al to tel this tale,
as Mr Poe claims that he at some point is the author who takes up the pen
from the vanished Pym in order that his tale "might live on" so to speak.

When Pym shows up in the Appendix, live after, --this suddenly recasts the
Narrative as a book which is actually not the book of the authors, either
one--but one which is actually not yet written, but exists as it does "so
far" in this "half man half horse" state of having the two seamless
authors--one of them presumed dead and replaced part way through by a "ghost
writer" who has to face the return of the ghost as not a ghost once the text
has been "completed," and now lies on the floor, a ball of a "Yarn" (story)
being madly unwoven by one of Poe's own "Imps of the Perverse."

Mark Twain is another form of writer in which appropriation is used on a
vast scale, though in a way it may not at first seem so to be.  His books
like Roughing It and Life on the Mississippi, for example, are vast
Herodotus style compendiums of anecdote, facts, fictions, outright lies that
he relishes re-telling, pure unadulterated tall stories, wild characters who
actually are real, and others who are characters "larger than life" because
in fact they do not exist at all except as towering feats of story telling.

In Twain's world, the good telling of lie is a grandiose and magnificent
thing to behold--a great tall story, a superb "yarn," the getting togetehr
of literary and journalist friends "to swap a few lies," being the epitome
of a "good time."  These "lies" are contrasted to the bigger lies which
Twain continually attacks as the lies which society uses in order to create
its structures of distinctions, borders and boundary lines between peoples
and their social status, their possibilities in life, what their dreams are
allowed to consist of.
Magnificent River Boats sail past cities with names like Memphis, Cairo, St
Louis, Nouvelle Orleans--extravagant architectures of mansions, beautifully
tended gardens, al the bric-a-brac of an already "post modern style" which
mixes the native materials in the making of imitations of buildings the
wonders have never seen except in illustrations and associate with being of
an "Ancient Dynasty" or a Roman Republic, or Greece, England, France.  And
in this world are the forerunners of Faulkner's characters running amok in
feuds and violence, ignorance and dissolution.  And al of it built on
slavery and exploitation, in order to build a mansion that can be seen from
the River Boats to make one think one is living in a civilization
"elsewhere," as though in another time completely.

Life on the Mississippi is actually a great anarkeyology of appropriation,
in every aspect of the furniture, the houses' designs, the styles adopted
and created in clothing, the types of books which are in the libraries,
every detail is seen as an appropriation from elsewhere, a vast fantasy
world trying to imitate things that it does not comprehend nor want to other
than what it symbolizes.  And even in the midst of al the grandeur and
posing, there is the vision of the incipient, swift rush of decay,
decomposition, the first signs of the ghosts that will soon enough inhabit
this fantasy world as it slides into the past, as gone as as were the
previous bends in the ever changing course of the river.

All one has to do is study the Twain book and then move on the tomes of
images made through decades of this same world by Clarence john
Laughlin--himself the owner of one of the best private libraries in America,
an immense eccentric assemblage of heaps and crates and shelves put togetehr
by himself--a great admirer of Baudelaire and French poetry and prose--and
there is the after effects" world of Twain's--ghostly, in ruins,
depopulated, haunted and still the repository for this huge collection of
appropriated styles and structures in their journey through time's
decomposing. What Luaghlin writes of in his notes accompanying his works, is
of a world which in reality is already a Surreality--the fotos in which he
constructs strange dreamlike scenes among the already strange "real scenes"
are simply the introduction of figures and tableaux to stages that are
already crying out for actors.  since they already inhabit a "living dream,"
a living-death, the introduction of the "faked" dream scenes seems
"perfectly natural."

(I used a transfer of a Laughlin fotoa door in 1950's Milwaukee as part of a
collage piece for the cover of an issue of Kaurab Poetry Journal--and "After
effect" of the ghostliness in Laughlin's fotos become more ghostly via its
transposition as a transfer of a xeroxed copy of the copy of the photo
included in a book of his work.)

If turning to thes particular models as examples of appropriation at work
seems "old fashioned," don't be fooled, their controversial nature rages
on.  I picked up by chance the other day a new updated edition of Norman
Finkelstein's Beyond Hutzpah--and opened as though by magic to a section
which reproduces pages from Twain's book on his travels to the Middle East
and Europe.  The controversy that rages in these pages detailing the
reproduced pages of Twain's MS is that Finkelstein demonstrates how passages
from twin have been edited, slightly altered, taken a bit out of context,
and used as evidence by Alan Dershowitz, who is also plagiarizing from a
discredited text which he pretends that he is not plagiarizing from, of some
passage in Twain regrading the "non-existence" of Palestinian peoples in
certain areas of contemporary Israel-Palestine. Finkelstein is an excellent
example of a researcher who goes through the long series of twists and turns
of a quotation, a footnote, single word, in order to arrive at an
understanding not only of what "originally or actually happened," but also,
what has happened along the way, in the uses of a quotation or appropriated
text.  Since his argument is with a famous Harvard Law School member and
lawyer, Finkelstein relishes the opportunity to pick apart the arguments
involved, the citations and texts.


On the one hand, the famous lawyer is shown to be plagiarizing from a
discredited text a severely altered mis- or dis-quotation from Twain, and on
the other, is Finkelstein's excavations of the layers of the text's
palimpsests, alterations, transpositions, and is being turned into a "fact"
in order to "prove" that a contemporary situation is based on "solid
evidence."

What is surprising from the point of view of literary--and legal--
appropriation is that a lawyer would use the uncited source of a discredited
work in which a quotation is found from a famous author, which can easily be
checked. What has happened is that a faked version of a documentary account
by a fiction writer is taken as being a "reality" that existed in the past
which proves the validity of the present reality.  By demonstrating the
faked and thus fictionalized use of the documentary account to prove
"reality," Finkelstein undercuts the present "reality" by the restoration of
the original text's actual order of words and phrases and in their correct
contexts.

The Twain who journeys from the Cairos and Memphises of the USA to those of
the "Ancient World," having detailed the appropriations of the New World in
al their faked glories, and hungry to see the "originals," becomes in turn
appropriated as a faked "glory" text himself, who is then "restored" to his
original state in his own words by a commentator in an argument over the
borders and existences of peoples both in the past and in the present which
uses the past to justify itself.

In this example alone, one find some of the aspects in which appropriated
texts become part of arguments over literally appropriated lands, as well as
depictions of appropriated city names and styles of architecture and manners
and reading materials which wind up being part of the future historical
reality of the ancient places that are both  used as models  and their
actualities as sites visited as a tourist by the famous author of a previous
century.   The shuttling back and forth through versions of the text is
accompanied by a shuttling back in forth in time as well as a shuttling back
and forth between versions of land boundaries in the present based on
accounts from the past found in the text and altered only to be restored.
The text itself becomes an extention of a "space of contested possession"
not only as a text, but also in the world and in a conflict between the uses
of the past to justify the present.

Via uncited citation, a hoaxed appropriation of a text enters into an
intense argument over geography and history It is this aspect of
appropriation of texts as actual documents in appropriations of land and
history that provides the kind of destabilizing as well as destabilizing
"after effects" which make more complex  the senses of and uses of "literary
appropriation."  As with Travel Literature, texts become the genesis for
immense debates over the actual legitimacy of ownership of colonized lands
and the rights of peoples who essay to inhabit these lands.

Interestingly, this aspect of the "after effects" of appropriations of
"literary" and "travel" texts tends to be ignored in most considerations of
appropriation of texts,, which tend to regard the literary appropriation as
being limited to that one area, and so the more "formal" qualities of an
appropriation mechanism at work may be examined rather than potentialities
in other areas such as geography, history, the military, legal arguments,
etc.

In effect, to limit the awareness of the effects and "After effects" of
texts in and as appropriation, has the peculiar and subtle effect of a
removal from consideration of the abilities of texts to have these effects
and After effects.  That is, one develops a sense of the use of language
which has no "consequences," nor, in effect, any "complicities."  This
creates a separation in language, in which on one hand "transgressions in
language" are urged, while those outside this realm are not.  And if this is
to be maintained as a structure of belief and method, then the
transgressions of texts across the limits of the text's boundaries, becomes
something to in effect deny.  In this way, the peculiar argument can be
advanced that in changing language via transgressing boundaries within it,
one is changing the world, and at the same time, that this use of language
is not in any responsible for what is happening around it, nor that the
words that it uses are just as contaminated as the ones others use.

This sense of a "purifying of the language of the tribe" as advanced by
Mallarme, is in many ways related to the ways in which propaganda functions,
by limiting the range of effects which are allowed to be considered, so as
to narrow the focus on an ever more centralized configuration and figure or
figures of power. In a sense, it points to an elite grouping of poets or
writers or artists who are as it were the guardians of this language, and so
are deemed the ones to determine the entry or not into the canons or
"acceptable ones" of this or that artist or style, this or that version of
appropriation as opposed to an other. Rtaher than a rhizomatic, horizontal
movement of the energies of appropriation, one finds instead a vertical axis
along which are stacked the categories of hegemonies and hierarchies.

In a sense, this removes the role of the "dead author" and replaces it with
a kind of deity, a philopsher-poet-king-queen in a sense, of an aristocracy
of the word.

Yet as the example of the traveling through times and spaces and altered and
restored versions of Twain's text shows, the appropriation of texts and
objects opens the arenas of action and makes for the dispersal across the
unexpected of the ever uncertain findings and uses of words, and of the
existences of "authors," not at all as fixed identities, but as ever
changing "sources," and "citations" which "crop up in the oddest of places."

Texts and authors in this senses live lives of their own, which are outside
the conventions of what are thought to be the boundaries of texts and
authorship.  That this proliferation and dispersal of texts and authors
among al manner of terrains and times may turn up in situations with which
"literature" so to speak would like to "disconnected from", this is because
of the "troubling" non-possession of words and texts which copy right and
intellectual property laws continually try to keep pace with.  The borders
which literature would like to keep sealed for itself, or art, or any other
form which has created a language it regards as its own and its own
only--these borders appropriation shows not to be as secure as one would
have thought, and so the desire for kind of "homeland security"system to
control this "terrorism of words" against the very Terror in a sense which
would dominate them.  This is the sense in which the areas of language in
literature begin to become a part of the operations of aspects of
propaganda, in that the desire and need to control and maintain power
supersedes the "love of language" and begins to see that the means to in
effect "torture" language are "justified by the ends."

Again, one finds "travel literature" as a form of the contesting of borders,
not only among settlers and already local populations in the New and Old
Worlds, but also the borders among texts as "faked," "documentary
evidences," "depictions of fakes as being a reality," and the use of fakes
to assert a present reality based on an altered one via an altered text.
The ebb and flow of the fake, the real, the fictional, the literary and the
actual landscapes involved in terms of borders and possessions--as well as
"battles for the very soul of the people and land"--al these are bound up
with the uses made of appropriation through a great many levels within just
one small dis-quoted quotation from a text by an author who himself depicted
so much use of appropriation as a manner of constructing the fantasy land
reality he witnessed in its heights and the first signs of its rapid decay
and decomposition.

Even the current dramas of the American-Israeli interrelationships are
depicted in this using of an American text as a "witness" to be argued with
in a "case" for or against a version of history that is contested.

The travel aspect of uses of appropriation is one that begins to change in
the 19th century, with the ability to import ever greater amounts of goods
from every farther distant and more "exotic" arts of the world, as well as
those "exotics" which exist close to hand.  (The Surrealists' Flea market,
Joseph Cornell's garage full of old magazines and found matrials from thrift
stores, etc, Schwitter's use of street found debris--and the one found by
Dubuffet in his concept of Art Brut.)

In Baudelaire, the continual theme of "le Voyage" needs no distant places to
go--it can be a journey through his mistress' hair, or through a grubby
alley--or to a hashish smoking session.  Later, Huysman's character Des
Esseintes in A Rebours Against the Grain is the Engllish title) simply goes
to an English pub as it exits in its exact state for the use of Englishmen
in Paris, rtaher than having to bore himself with the tedium expense and
time of a trip to the actual England.  Travel becomes the voyage of reverie,
dream, released by contact with talismanic objects, odors, colors, sounds
and images, texts which are from the place or about the place to which one
would like to go.

"To shut the eyes is travel" says Emily Dickinson, who wrote of books as
ships with which to travel.

In this sense, to me, the Yasusada works and Yasusada's idea of writing an
"After Spicer" in honor of  Spicer's "After Lorca" functions itself as a
travel literature example, in that using the construction which is made use
of by the hoxed imitations of scholarship of "real texts by real authors,"
in creating a series of fictional and pseudonymous authors, editors,
translators, footnoters, annotators, as well as quotations which are real
and fictional or faked, to  construct both a fictional author and his
fictional works, as well the journey to a distant and exotic land--a Japan
which is not Japan but an "After Japan," not a translation or copy, nor
actual documents, but an imaginary constructed out of the elements of these
. via both actual and fictional Japanese poets, artists, places and events.
After all, what is Spicer's Lorca's Spain?  Or his Spanish language?  Where
are they existing in Spicer's text?  The traveling with Lorca that Spicer
indicates is done in the home of Spicer's, as of two lovers living togetehr
for a season.  It is in a sense of the continuation of the voyage of
Baudelaire through his mistress' hair as a voyage-to-a-text, as well as that
voyage of Poe,s in which the white ghostly spaces left by the vanished ghost
of the lover-- "After" effects, so that work is written both "After" Lorca
literarily and" literally"--after Lorca the lover of the summer in autumn
has departed.  And indeed, the introductory letter opening the text is
written by Lorca--the already dead poet speaking from beyond the grave as
his own ghostly After effects become ghost-written by Spicer as his "After
Lorca."

For Poe, the "Aftereffects' are "mournful and never ending remembrance"
which also tries continually to be reanimated from out of the coffin--into a
state between life and death, dream and waking--in which al things possible
may occur--an open area of uncertainty--where Poe and Pym takes turns
authoring the same text, each one vanishing as the other reappears, back
from the supposedly dead, to assert his rightful place in place of the one
living and writing in his absence.  To battle with the double of oneself--in
this suspended state--the tale of "William Wilson"--Rimbaud and his "I is an
other"--the confrontation with the hoaxy aspects as well as the documentary
and imaginary--of writing and of what is an author--not a who--but a
what--as though the author really matters--when as Poe asserts in the
"Philosophy of Composition" --one begins with determining what the effect is
that one would like to produce.

In other words, an "after effect" which precedes its own creation--just as
the "Philosophy of Composition" is written AFTER the composition of "The
Raven" and so re-tells the "story" of its creation as an "after-thought" as
well as an After-effect----which "reconstructs" an event which actually did
not happen, in order to make an argument for the kind of Composition Poe is
propounding as the one best suited to create the kind of "great effects on
an audience" that the "Raven" had.  By demonstrating that he worked
backwards, deductively and rationally to produce what are the "irrational"
yet also "mechanically engineered" effects of the poem and its Raven
repeatedly & (a robot Raven, an "synthetic intelligence"--?)
mechanically"quothing""Nevermore"--Poe writes "after the fact" the non
history of a poem in order to prove that his "irrationality" as person does
not exist, nor does it in the poem, but al of it, all of it--can be
explained!

In the very act of essaying to be the ultra rational one, Poe begins to
sound not unlike one of his irrational characters in the process of trying
to defend their actions, which came from that other source he depicts so
vividly in a different piece, "The Imp of the Perverse."

As a writer, Poe is experiencing and detailing not the "death of the
author"--but the cracking, corroding, collapsing, dispersal and
disappearance-reappearance dead-alive, living dead,suspended animation state
of an author in which the uncertainty principle is at work. so that the
author is beginning to have trouble distinguishing between himself and his
invented authors, his characters,his texts, his hoaxes and documentations,
his published "marginalia" which appear in Newspapers as "real" and which
are "made up" as he owned no library to annotate, but only about three books
at the time.

And how does Poe exist today?  He stil exists as after effects in America as
the the creation of a poison pen obituary written by Rufus Griswold! The
source for good deal of the myths of Poe is this outright piece of slander.
Poe himself became a part of long running tabloid sensationalism, both
adding to and altering, shifting, his status as a writer hovering ever
suspended among a series of faked images and stories about himself, and his
own such creations.  In this sense Poe has realized in a peculiar way one
aspect of his dream of existing among the living-dead, as he himself
continues to exist as this mixture of urban legend, movie versions,
illustrations, endless repackagings of his works, endless new theories about
them, endless new discoveries not only of original editions themselves but
also of the actual facts which he did make use of and which had been thought
to be his own hoaxes.

In a sense, to understand a genealogy of "post modern" examples of
appropriation, is to find Burroughs' impossible glossary of wrods whose
intention are fugitive--for the moment one were to define, control, st
boundaries and divide into categories, classifications, the very thing one
is observing in order to do this, would continually be breaking it asunder,
decomposing it, rearranging it--and so, the place to "begin" is in actuality
in the daily newspapers or news in any media--as there one finds the
continual dispersal of writings and writers evidenced in the symptoms of
language which are registering the seismographic chartings of voyages which
never cease traveling, never cease their production of effects and After
effects, fall out, radioactive dusts--mutations and permutations--ghosts and
ghost written texts--

The "Purloined Letter(s)" found hidden in plain site/sight/cite all around
one--
the War which was founded on forged texts and paintings of non existent
fotos--the widespread use of "election fraud" as a technique both to count
voting and to frighten off voting--
the uses of torture to produce "confessions" which are false or real or who
knows what--but which are none the less used as "proofs"--even though the
actual confession may never be revealed--
the persons detained without any accusations--
that is, the non-writings of non texts which condemn persons non accused to
be detained indefinitely--
the ways in which a society inoculates itself by the alteration and
vanishing of words from what it does not want to or like to or is not meant
to hear or read--
the uses of appropriation are everywhere one around--
perhaps what is really the purpose is to find the ways in which these are
all interrelated and so constitute the existence of culture as it is
presenting itself to itself through its appropriated and faked and hoaxed
uses of words and images-
rather than a typology in which the separations are made so as to exclude
one domain from another--and so to deny or deliberately or not miss the
effects and After effects of all the various means and meanings of
appropriation--

This particular study of my own i call "The New Extreme Experimental
American Poetry and Arts"--
this interrealtionship of aspects across, among, through and around
appropriation in constructing a language which essays to deny what it is
capble of and is in many instances doing daily, as a matter of routine--
a language which allows persons the appearnces of freedom when in fact
tightening and contsraining ever more tightly and narrowly the ranges of
awareness and questioinng-
and at the same time to find the actions and uses of appropriation which
decompose this massive compostion one is presented with as a reality which
in fact is but a continaully tweaked construction in which language used by
all is participating daily--
to study the composition and to find the decompositions--
as much as possible, though one oneself is pitifully limited--

Dear Murat And Barry:


Barry--many thanks for your having checked on the translations and in
comparison with others as you
 call them, Straight translations"--

though perhaps Spicer may have made use of existing translations to create
his own versions of these translations--
rather than having made the translations directly from the Spanish--
(this method is used in many cases actually as a form of translation, rather
than necessarily "After"--as one may have a translator who knos the language
make the "straight translation" and the poet then make use of this to create
heir own translation using the raw translated words--
--
(i only suggest these as possibilities-among many---)

Murat--I think you misunderstand me--

what i am trying to present is not ONE version of what translation or
appropriation may be, nor to say that there exists one method only as the
most common, nor two nor three--

quite the contrary--what interests me are the ceaseless proliferations
brought about by translations and appropriations--indeed their "After
effects" and further translations and appropriations through time--

i think perhaps that what you have found for yourself is a method and
authority in which your profoundly believe and make use of--

and judged by this manner, none other really has the same level of existence
and authority---

so, in a sense, the single-mindedness of purpose becomes impatient with the
suggestions of other methods and examples however  recognized, actual.
weird, vague, bad or indifferent as well as "authorized" that exist in al
their teeming fecund chaotic rhizomatic voyagings--

(i'm not a descendant  of French-Indian Voyageurs for nothing,after all!--)

what interests me is that from one single word in any language may become
such proliferations of meanings, events, personages, writers, singers,
painters, all the world in fact, soldiers, forgers, bombers, martyrs,
presidents and prostitutes--Bible thumpers, gangbangers, all of them--poets
and pall bearers, carnival clowns and congress persons--

ghosts, ghost writers, Posthumous ghosthumous writers--"After effects" of an
After writing of one's own writings such as Musil's  early 1930's
collection  of his "Posthumous works of a living author"--

so it is that i find what you do with translation very beautiful, and at the
same time i carry in mind many others ways of translating, and ways of
appropriating, whatever their motives and intentions--simply to bear in mind
that there is no fixed limit on what may be sounded within a word's depths--
nor perhaps in the depths of the  minds and hearts which make use of these-

As i noted before, through a series of posts i am hoping to keep alive both
the positive and negative as well as the indifferent and careless or
accidental aspects of appropriations and translations--

and as well their spilling out across boundaries, so that a poetical text
lands somewhere else entirely, part of a land dispute--or a conflict over
the types of flowers which oonce appeared in a region--and who may have been
the ones who planted them--and many other thousands of things besides--
oepn the newspaper, and there one may find daily some example at work of
this proliferation having effects and After effects in all manner of ways
and means--

In one letter, a more negative aspect may seem to be at the fore, and in the
next a more positive--
this is to indicate that sense of language of Burroughs' "no final glossary
may be made of words whose intentions are fugitive"--

actually I hadn't been thinking at all of the Guantanamo Poems about which i
have on line some essays--but rather the daily uses of translation as well
as the poetic ones, for to me what is intersting is how these are
interrelated, rather than separate--

which is one of the bases for my series re "The New Extreme Experimental
Poetry and Arts"--

actually in a very good translation of a poem may exist every bit as much
manipulation for a purpose as there does in what you think of as one with
bad intentions and so done poorly--

precisely the survival of certain texts through time has depended in ways
upon the directions they were shifted by translators who wished to keep them
alive--
or, in order to adjust them to seem to be the precursors of a current
doctrine, whether of poetry or of the state or other institutions--

this is why translations are always being done over again, new ones
appearing to displace the old--in order to give a sense of the works being
"part of and important for our times" as well as for their own--

this is a matter of"poetry politics" often just as much as it may be of
"national politics"--

so it is that a current poet may give one a version which is far more in
tune with the current kinds of poetry considered the most important or
best--

and this new version may not be much like a previous "outdated" one--

and yet considered to be a very good one in part because it does indeed,
make the translated poet much more "available" to the modern reader --

i am not disagreeing with you or Benjamin, at all, but simply saying that
what interests me personally is the proliferations of possibilities of
appropriation and translation, which extend writing into other realms of
endeavor, and create After effects quite unexpected by the original source--

the danger of thinking that there are only certain models of translation in
existence by which to examine translations and to create them with--is that
there will become a creation of forms of conventionalism-conformity---which
in a sense denies the immense variety of possibilities, and in so doing,
actually makes it easier for other more sinister versions to slip themselves
into the mix and not be noticed, or simply waved to the side--as being of
little importance--or quality--when in fact they may be carrying along
something of great significance, for the bad or good--yet which bears being
aware of--

in a sense one might say that i am not driven by a "rationale" so much as by
a sense never ceasing of amazement, of being astounded, by the ways in which
words are used, their incredible paradoxes and paradoxical After and "side
effects," the ways in which they can be used to sell anything from Gods to
garbage bags, Presidents to pills--and as well make poetry that stops the
blood cold--

in turn the sense of amazement has its companion, skepticism--questioning,
awareness of quantum leaps and uncertainty--of camouflages and the beings of
things wccih do not want to be as it were recognized--translated or
appropriated--not because of "resistances"--but something else, an outside--

"The hills know but do not tell"--as Emily Dickinson puts it--
and the Tao which can be named is not the Tao--


in the word "After" in Spicer's title is also another meaning, besides the
predatory one you write of-- which is that this is written as it were "after
the affair is over" in order in a sense to comprehend what Spicer is finding
are its "After effects"--

Spicer indicates this in the "Last letter" and also in the final stanza of
"Radar" the postscript poem dedicated to marianne moore which "ends" the
book and the letter, the final letter to Lorca.

These words of a vanished forever ghost lover are, to me at any rate,
heartbreakingly  beautiful--almost too much to bear to read--

Here is both the "After" the summer affair of love--and also--the "After
effects"--as Spicer depicts them (with on the way, in this last letter, also
a discussion of "Poe's mechanical chess player."--Again, an After effect of
Poe as I have been discussing these--

From the letter's third paragraph:

*"Yet it was there.  ("The intimate communion with the ghost of Garcia
Lorca" which now "is over.")  The poems are there, the memory not of a
vision but a kind of casual friendship with an undramatic ghost who
occasionally looked through my eyes and whispered to me, not really more
important than my other friends, but now achieving a level of reality by
being missing.  Today, alone by myself, it is like having lost a pair of
eyes and a lover.
       "What is real, I suppose will endure.  Poe's mechanical chess player
was not the less a miracle for having a man inside it, and when the man
departed, the games it had played were no less beautiful.  The analogy is
false, of course, but it holds both a promise and a warning for each of us.
      "It is October now.  Summer is over.  Almost every trace of the months
of that produced these poems has been obliterated.  Only explanations are
possible, only regrets.
       "Saying goodbye to a ghost is more final than saying goodbye to a
lover.  Even the dead return, but a ghost, once loved, will never reappear.

Love, Jack

And here is the final stanza of the postscript poem, Radar"
(which, notice, is a palindrome-the same read backwards and forwards--)

"I crawled into bed with sorrow that night
Couldn't touch his fingers.  See the splash
Of the water
The noisy movement of the cloud
The push of the humpbacked mountains
Deep at the sand's edge.'
*


These "After effects" are real for Spicer, as what happened is becoming, now
that it is over, and seen in this "After" existence--ever more real--even as
it as a ghost lover is gone forever--the missing of it becomes a reality
almost too much to bear and yet, as Spicer says--"It will endure."

It is  another aspect of Poe's "mournful and never ending remembrance" of
the lost loved one, now dead-Just as "The Philosophy of Composition" is an
After effect of the poem "The Raven," so this  final letter to Lorca is a
coming to terms with finding a "philosophy of composition" in order to
understand why the now departed ghost lover is becoming more real than it
had been while present, in part because it will never reappear again, and
how it was that the poems were composed, came to be, without at the time
realizing what was happening--not until they had the opportunity to be as
they have become, the generators of a time's memory which has turned into a
missing reality, never again to return.  It is in the After-event,
After-effect that the "philosophy of composition" becomes a reality--and the
poetry which preceded becomes in turn "more real" than previously the poet
had been aware of.


This distance--into which a dead ghost lover is forever departed--never to
return--
is a "real and final" distance, the full force of an intimacy never to be
again--
and so is the distance which has a life of its own--
out side and away from the poet and the poem--
and to be an outside also for the reader--

In a sense, this kind of distance is what i write of as things which do not
want to be appropriated or translated, but to be what they are, distance,
never to reappear--never to be possessed--

i n a sense, writing itself, and also a writer, may wish to keep a privacy
even within the writing, which will never be found, not by anyone, because
the ghost lover it is created with is gone for ever--
or because there are things which ghosts and writers wish to keep to
themselves, just as writing itself may have such things which are never
found that are living with in it--
as though in fact long gone--never to reappear--

and yet one day one finds--hidden in plain sight/site/cite--
which "neither speaks nor conceals but gives signs"
as Heraclitus says of the One Whose Oracle is at Delphi--

Also, if one is adopting so completely the method of Benjamin, in a sense
are you not creating what you see as an opposition to your own work's claims
within it:

"If so, as you
> state, the "philosophy" of the translator turns the original into a text
> totally in the translator's image. That is an act of exploitation, the
very
> reverse of what I am talking about."

That is, if one is so embracing the philosophy of translation of Benjamin,
is not one in effect running the risk of turning the original "totally" not
into the translator's image, but in to the image of the philosophy of
translation which is guiding the translator?

is not one in a sense working then in the service of a particular philosophy
of translation?

This is one of the reasons why i essay to keep alive the sense of the
incredibly teeming and endlessly imaginative and inventive ways in which
translations and appropriations may be created and used, whether for good or
bad, better or worse, in order that one has a sense that there are always
going to be at least two sides to every coin, and once it is being flipped
about--
well--who knows how many different sides may suddenly show up via the
actions of palming and shifting the coin as it is being flipped--

What i hope to convey with readers or listeners if there are any real or
imagainary ones about is that words and phrases poems and prose lead lives
of their own as well as the ones which a writer may or not have
intended--and any given reader have found or put there along the way--and
that even when things seem to be one way, it is  always interesting if not
often quite useful to find other ways in which the words may be
understood--for in them are living beings--with whom to engage--
or who wish to engage themselves with oneself--

The more ways these words are understood as alive--
is not this then to proliferate the lives of what are called writers and
readers--
as realities with real effects and After effects--

one thinks of the resistances of texts--why not also of those of living
beings--
and of the outside--

in the sense in which a Russian artist says that "Language is a fascism, not
becuase it censors, but because it forces one to speak."

a sense of words whose intentions are fugitive, not to be trapped inside a
prison of languages which one is forced to speak--

to continue--on the move--
as though one were indeed a hill set in movement--
yet, seen as a hill--
not expected nor forced to speak--

Subject:      Proposition 8 in California
In-Reply-To:  A<5eb0f8fd0811031157u6bf4fb58g4a4251fae0756caa@mail.gmail.com>

Hello to all from the state of California.

We currently have on the ballot for tomorrow, Proposition 8 an anti-gay =
marriage initiative.  Since many of these types of public initiatives
are tested in California for other states, I am wondering a few things
with interest in hearing from residents of other states in particular.

I am no expert so I am only relying on anecdotal or experiential and =
fragmentary knowledge here.  I am personally totally opposed to 8.

1.)  In the past, this issue was a splinter issue, used for or against
candidates as smearing.  Is this an exception this year?

2.)  I think perhaps Obama and other democrats can see demonstrable
comfort in their own chances at winning or keeping their positions, for =
some such as Feinstein (no big surprise with her San Francisco
base) but others as well are strongly voicing opposition to 8.  My =
thesis
is that gay marriage has broken through the glass ceiling to become
an issue of its own, not just fodder for negative campaigning.
This is the main reason I am posting--have we seen a changed climate for
gay marriage (perhaps a grossly underwhelming thesis here) --and if =
true,
what are the benchmark moments for this important cross over?

3.)  Opponents of 8 apparently include Repub. Governor Mighty Man =
Schwarzenegger.

4.)  Proponents of 8 are trying to induce fear by saying that gay =
marriage
will become a part of public education or, "why would the California =
Teacher's Union be opposed to it."  As a teacher and a parent of two =
children in the k-12 school system, I find it interesting that =
homophobia
and bilingual education have both been vetted through this many times
damning public initiative system we have in California.  That is, =
populism
has the potential to damage education.  Though perhaps "damage" and =
"education" are already one in the same.

5.)  Recently, two Korean-American kids I know were called gay in the =
boy's
locker room at the local middle school in a hateful manner.  The next =
day,
two of the children involved were suspended for punching each other.
I find the combination of race-based hostility and homophobia very
indicative of how race and gender/sexuality are coupled in school yard
hazing.  I hope gay marriage is taught to kids, though I doubt that's =
what's
at stake here. =20

By the way, I am a straight single mother of two boys who I educate in =
gay
marriage by sharing stories of how one must never be hateful to others,
especially to those who are hated by many.

These are my thoughts on Prop 8.

Thanks,

Edith Vasquez

"actually in a very good translation of a poem may exist every bit as much
manipulation for a purpose as there does in what you think of as one with
bad intentions and so done poorly--

precisely the survival of certain texts through time has depended in ways
upon the directions they were shifted by translators who wished to keep them
alive--
or, in order to adjust them to seem to be the precursors of a current
doctrine, whether of poetry or of the state or other institutions--"


David,

I am not sure where we are disagreeing. The "misreading" I am talking about
does bend the original into "a vision of the original." The translator
translates that vision which may create consequences on both sides of the
occasion. That is, for example, what Ezra Pound's "The Seafarer" does. It
(re-)introduces a music of consonants into English poetry, in opposition to
Victorian sonorities.

I think you are reacting to the categorical tone of some of my arguments.
The truth is I do not believe in false modesty, and I do believe there are
good and bad translations. I am trying to explain what I believe transforms
translation into a poetic genre -like the lyric or epic or dramatic- rather
than a method of reproduction. You also suggest, I think, that my view of
translation is abstract, only an application of Benjamin's specific ideas of
translation into a method. The reality is that my ideas of translation are
derived completely empirically, out of my thirty years of practice. Only
when my ideas of translation developed did I begin to see its correspondence
with the ideas expressed in "The Task of the Translator." In effect, when I
first read that essay, I completely misunderstood it, thinking his
references to "intentio" of a language and to "ideal language" more or less
gibberish. Only during the writing of the Turkish anthology, developing my
concept of "eda," did I become aware of the profundity of those aspects of
his essay. In other words, as you say about "The Raven" and "The Philosophy
of Composition," Benjamin's essay become for me a means of framing my idea
of eda, its foreignness, within a half comprehensible Western framework.
Actually, to create "eda," I had to "misread" both Turkish poetry and Walter
Benjamin "to my own purposes." That does not mean that "eda," which embodies
for me the image of translation, does not say something truthful about both
Turkish poetry and Walter Benjamin.

Affectionately,

Murat

I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

http://youtube.com/results?search_query=hallelujah

Listening to music on the Internet. You want a song, you search for it in
eMule. You download five different versions of it for free and listen to
them all. You use google to search for the lyrics, find several versions,
and also find a Wikipedia entry that details the lore of the song. Then you
search youtube for videos of the song and listen to it that way for a while.

Wow. Incredible.

*Pete's Big Poetry Series / The Multifarious Array presents:*

*Tim Peterson, Kate Broad, Adam Tobin, & Dave Carillo*

Hosted by Sommer Browning


Friday, November 7, 2008

7:00pm - 9:00pm

Pete's Candy Store

709 Lorimer St.

Brooklyn, NY



Tim Peterson lives in Brooklyn and writes poetry, all the while seeking out
other complexly gendered individuals for companionship and connection,
hungry for articulations of reading and being read as voiced experiences
hunting you like a bluejay. SINCE I MOVED IN (Gil Ott Award, Chax Press) was
published in 2007. Tim edits EOAGH: A Journal of the Arts.



Adam Tobin owns and operates Unnameable Books, a new and used bookstore in
central Brooklyn. He is author of Ode to Pumpsie Green & Stretch Phillips
(horse less press, 2005) and editor of The Weekly Weakling (forthcoming), a
series of occasional letterpress pamphlets. You may have seen his older work
in EOAGH or Fence or other publications, but he hasn't really written much
since he opened the bookstore. He promises, however, to read at this reading
at least one poem you've never seen before.



David Carillo lives in West Hartford with his wife and dog. He is working on
his MFA in Creative Nonfiction at the University of Pittsburgh and teaches
English at the University of Connecticut at Waterbury. He has poems
forthcoming in Nanomajority.



Kate Broad has lived in India and Brazil and currently resides in Brooklyn,
where she is a doctoral student in English at the City University of New
York Graduate Center. She has poems in Freshwater, The Wellesley Review, and
forthcoming in Karamu, and has won several writing awards, including one
from the Academy of American Poets. Kate is working on her first full-length
manuscript, Hard to Swallow.

Dear Murat:

Oh my goodness, no--
I am not disagreeing with you at all, Murat.

The section you quote here is just me rattling off more of variations of
ways appropriation can be and has been applied through time.
Forgive the sudden outburst of this "flash flood" of words words and more
words!

I think you know one of the great many reasons I admire and respect your
work so much--not only the translations--but also the poetry and the book on
photography and your essays--
is that you have precisely the empirical approach to your thoughts and words
that you note--so that at one point in time, the Benjamin seems
incomprehensible, fantastic, yet through working continually one breaks
through into understanding--"a profane illumination" occurs, and one does
indeed recognize the actions and presences of the "chips of messianic Time"
as they are Illuminated--

Many of Benjamin's works have had a profound effect on myself also.

My  ragged ideas and "works" have a similar approach with yours as they come
through time, and along the way, one jettisons a good number--and finds more
to think on, and in turn these link or not via associations with previous
ones, in turn creating new series of associations--only through practice and
walking around all over and in all sorts of places and hauling them about
and exposing them to the elements --does one arrive at some further depths
as these seep in through the various crackings and crevices, crevasses and
collapses of decompostions, synchronicties, corrosions--
a prolonged series of of seismic shiftings which continually keep things on
the move--
and here and there the quantum leap of the unexpected, the uncanny, a sudden
running directly in to a wall--of graffiti of the eslehweres that tumble out
of the skies
--as ever, in friendship and respect--
david



through the chink in the fence--

a strip of sky & earthen wall--

in what faraway land

among hostile forests--

to sit in someone else's room
among books not mine
& write about the sky


to pen ghosts' writings,
scrawl notations

of phantom songs--

the untold, the unwritten

scenes--
hidden,--

ever-- in plain sight

"from one single word in any
 language
 such proliferations of meanings,                                  events, personages,

 writers, singers,
 painters, all the world in fact,                                 soldiers, forgers,

translation/interpretation: Samuel Beckett wanted to avoid the play in English/ so he wrote in French. & i suspect he worked closely with whom/ever translated his work. Curious, however, that he never allowed much interpretation, or spin, outside the words. He wouldn't allow a director to give endgame or Godot a post nuclear spin.

Think of the long dead, those outside the popular domain (in the legal sense).

Congratulations to the USAmericans on the list. What a proud and beautiful
moment for you as a people. The faces of the people listening to Barack
Obama's acceptance speech in Chicago were filled with wonder, happiness,
hope, and pride. That is the USAmerica the rest of the world loves to see.
May he be as good a president as his acceptance speech. Damn that was good.

I don't know how many of us share my feeling that Obama's victory feels lik=
e we - as a republic (and, perhaps, the globe) - have (finally) been pulled=
 out of an iron-lung, one in which we have been encased for 8 long, paralyt=
ic years.
I am in San Francisco - and earlier this night in Berkeley - but there is m=
usic and dancing in the streets. Astonished all & happy happy happy!=A0=20
I know so much needs to be rebuilt, etc., etc., etc. but what is now feels =
good, good & real good.=20

Whew!=20

Yes true - this is the USAmerica all want to see.
A new country where the word "new" upholds a value rare to be found
elsewhere.

But I also hope your congrats extend to people like me who signed up for,
worked, supported the Obama campaign in every possible way during the last
several  months knowing fully well that I can't even cast my vote as I still
remain a citizen of India.

*Poetic Responses to the 2008 American Elections*

* *

*Call for Submissions*

*Artistic representations, responses, and interrogations of electoral event=
s
are very important expressions of the endless conversation between art and
historical experience. The 2008 American elections stimulated a lot of
artistic responses and there were, in the campaign discourses, some subtle
invocations of the postures of presidential aspirants to literature and
cultural productions generally. What, as a poet (defined broadly), is the
meaning of this whole experience of the 2008 elections? Send us your
previously unpublished works (poems, paintings, manipulated photographs,
etc) about the 2008 US elections for inclusion in an online anthology:While
the He/Art Pants (a title derived from Walt Whitman's poem reproduced
below), to soon appear on the Poet's Corner, Fiera Lingue. Images should be
on Jpeg format. As this promises to be a very interesting project, we
request that you send up to five of the most uncompromising and
stylistically surprising of your works and a short bio. Other works that do
not necessarily focus on the 2008 US elections but are relevant to the
dialogue between art and democratic politics will be considered. *

Stephen,

The same feeling is here in Harlem: Happiness, the "brotherhood of man", the
dancing in the streets, like nothing could ruin this night...now this
morning. Year 1.

As an American, I thank you Jim, I have waited decades to feel like this

Well, as I said a few months ago,
finally, the differences wont be that high.
We will still have a US president.
I dont think he will stop the anti-Cuban blockade.
I dont think he will get the bombers and shooters out of Afghanistan
and Iraq.
I think that before his four years are up he will bomb or invade at
least one small country.
I dont expect universal health care.
The wall along the Mexican border will not come down.
The CIA will still operate Colombia.
etc

It does feel a little nice, though.

Hi Stephen,

I'm In Chicago, and while I didn't make it out to Grant Park last night,
today there is a real feeling of uplift in the air. There's still a lot of
rubble to dig out of, but it now feels as if we might just make it.

aye.  and i hate to be a party pooper, but i gotta wait and see what he
does (obama).  i cannot bring myself to trust politicians, however
beautiful and whatever color.  did you hear nader this morning on democ.
now?  i voted, i even went to the celebration and it felt great, but "show
me," and i'm not even from missouri.  the most amazing thing to me is that
we've managed to elect a man who is not white, never mind that he grew up
in other countries, and had radical mentors.  and his family surely looks
healthy and sweet.  but no quarter for the palestinians, into afghanistan
with us, etc. etc.  sorry but...  gabe

Well, certainly he's not a magician, and to think the president alone
is responsible for reform is wrongheaded. It's the "American
mentality" that needs to change.

"Let's see" always follows the excitement....but without the
excitement, there's no "let's see."

Before we wet ourselves with excitement, let's=20
remember that any democrat who didn't get caught=20
sleeping with household pets would have won this=20
year, and that also in a lot of places black=20
statewide office holders are hardly novel. Obama=20
ran a great campaign, and he was a casting-office=20
perfect candidate, and of course it didn't hurt=20
getting almost 100% of an enlarged black vote,=20
but the states that flipped were very close the=20
last two times and moving steadily towards the=20
democrats, mostly due to demographic changes.=20
Low-hanging fruit. On the other hand, in the deep=20
south almost 80% of white folks voted against=20
Obama. And three states voted against gay=20
marriage and two against affirmative action.

I voted for the man, given what my choices were,=20
but for the life of me I can't figure out why he=20
ran (remember who else was in the democratic=20
field) except "yes I can." He's yet to express=20
any opinion or propose anything that would risk=20
hurting him with his constituents, which is=20
pretty amazing even for so short a time in=20
politics. Here are a few things he could do that=20
would make me wild with enthusiasm--hell, any one=20
of them would make a convert of me--but might=20
cost him votes and affection the next time around.

1.Obama has supported subsidies for corn ethanol=20
and for farming in general, presumably because it=20
pleased his Illinois constituents (it probably=20
didn't hurt him any in Iowa). These have each=20
been disastrous for Latin America (the subsidies=20
made American corn cheaper than the stuff grown=20
at home, and the ethanol boom raised worldwide=20
prices life-threateningly high), which is why so=20
many of them have been risking their lives to=20
cross the border. Then there's the environmental=20
damage. Obama could propose ending the subsidies.=20
As a bonus, it would put him in a position to suggest that the EU do the=
 same.

2. Mexico is descending into chaos as its=20
government acts as our surrogate in fighting the=20
drug lords. Colombia already went through this,=20
for how many years? A change in US drug laws=20
would end the problem in minutes--no prohibition,=20
no value, and a fix costs pennies. A lot of=20
states have moved (slowly) towards reduced=20
penalties, even decriminalization of possession=20
of some drugs. Even so, proposing=20
decriminalization would cost votes. Save a lot of money and lives, tho.

3. Need I mention the Cuban embargo? Obama will=20
probably return travel rules to their Clinton-era=20
status, but he's been pretty clear that Cuba has=20
to democratize to get the rest. He'd lose a lot of votes in Florida.

4. Israel's economy is dependent on 12 billion a=20
year in loan guarantees, without which no one=20
would make the short-term loans that all=20
economies need. That's the muscle that would get=20
them to the bargaining table toot sweet. Of=20
course it would cost most of the Jewish vote, which is why no one's done it.

I could probably come up with a few more. I'm waiting to be convinced.

Not so. In Harlem, last night was a dream. These constituents here were
already witnessing that dream. That's excitement!

I think for the first time in a long time, there's a feeling of HOPE, and
that's not to be taken lightly.  It was amazing to see the 125,000 people of
mixed races and ethnicities standing with each other and crying together at
his acceptance speech.  It was also inspiring to hear the excited talk of
young black men on public transportation yesterday morning as they recounted
what they'd seen on tv the previous night--these are people who didn't
before imagine that they had a voice.  There were 400,000 new voters in the
state of Georgia this year and an awful lot of them voted early, standing in
line for up to nine hours.

I appreciate that Obama appears to understand the difficult and daunting
task(s) ahead for him.  I just hope that people can remember that it took
the American people together to start the process of change, and it will
take the American people together to continue it....

David,

This is a wonderful poem. I assume it is yours, which is an interesting word
within the framework ownership/appropriation we have been discussing. To me
it has a fascinating fusion of German Romanticism and Emily Dickinson.

"Profane illumination" indeed. Though Benjamin's thought is godless, it is
religious, particularly in the Baudelaire/translation and "The art of the
Storyteller" essays and in *The Arcades Projec*t. The illuminations, which
can also be seen as visual annotations to texts, pour out from cracks and
crevices, between quotations, the seemingly wrong headed, meandering
questions he asks. He is able to see industrial industrial constructs, their
flatsom and jetsom, as dreams. I wonder my phrase "godless Sufism" has a
connection to that.

Ciao,

Murat

I have to say I agree with Sarah; there's definitely a sea change at work.
A lot of us have a sense of buried joy - I don't know how to put this - a
kind of disblief that the cold war warriors are on their way out, at least
for a while - no more cheney, bush, rice, and the rest of the cabal. We've
lived under a cloud for years and this is different and beautiful, if only
within the symbolic and possibly more. I _do_ mourn the setbacks to gay
rights and that has to be kept in mind (and as noted that took some of the
euphoria out of the moment) but we have to be able to open ourselves to
joy, something the left (I think myself among them) almost never does. The
right certainly has a sense of bitterness at the moment; it seems a shame
for the left to follow suit. Better to go I think with election parties
(we had one), the happiness and dancing in the streets - that's also part
of life. It's not naive and not giving in and not seeing the world with
blinders. It's being joyful.

I certainly don't think _any_ Democrat would have won; Gore didn't or did
but with hardly a landslide and conditions had been truly evil for a long
time. This was different - at least in NY the grass-roots voting efforts
were something I'd not seen before, not to this excent, not with McGovern
or Kennedy, not with anyone.

Perhaps the world _can_ be changed - I think it so - but not at the rate
that will satisfy a lot of people. And it has changed, and that was
reflected in Jesse Jackson's face for example which was haunting and happy
again in a way I hadn't seen before.

I'm probably one of the more pessimistic people on Poetics, and/but this
may be a time of subtle beauty. The worst thing is to give up hope, to
proceed with business as usual - that just in fact continues business as
usual...

I'm not immune to symbolism. but I was around for the last national
feel-good. It was great, desperate fun, though it didn't change
nearly as much of what needed and needs to be changed as we hoped.

A response "from a poet" seems to imply that those who disagree
aren't. That aside, "it's the job of the poet to love the world"
sounds like "so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son."
Or maybe "its's the job of cheerleaders to sleep with quarterbacks."
Taking part in the game of power is a form of self-seduction and
maybe self-delusion. It's the job of the poet to write poems, and
that comes in many forms. For me the poem is a tool of investigation,
as cold and clear-eyed as I can make it. It's fine by me if others
prefer to write coronation anthems.

Here's a piece of world-loving Obama could practice.

The US government leases vast amounts of land in the mountain west at
nominal rents to ranchers. This land has been overgrazed for
generations. Even so, there's not enough grass or a long enough
season to bring the cattle up to markey weight, so the major roads of
the high prairie are lined with feedlots which poison the air with
the stench of urine and incidentally degrade the aquifers beneath
them, where the cattle are force-fed corn grown in Illinois and Iowa.
The overgrazed land is at the headwaters of our major rivers, into
which increased, in places catastrophic, erosion drains. It also
contributes to flooding. So everybody downstream is affected. The
damage already done to the grazing lands is irreversible.

Even with all the freebies, and ignoring the damage, it's
inordinately expensive to produce beef this way, which is why killer
tariffs have been imposed on free-range Argentine beef, at a cost to
our diplomatic standing.

One can ignore the damage done in a time of impending water
shortages, but not the unlegislated tax levied on every bite of steak.

The leasing of grazing land and the rent charged is largely a matter
of executive branch policy, not legislation. It's not a sustainable
practice. Much of it could be changed with a stroke of the executive
pen. But that would anger voters in corn-growing states and in the
cattle-rearing states of the mountain west, newly-democratic Colorado
among them each of which have voters and two senators, largely funded
by big agribusiness companies and mining and oil-and-gas interests
(that's a whole other topic), whose votes are needed for things that
make life easier for folks who live in areas where the population
exceeds 2 per square mile.

I'd maybe trade my only-begotten son for a sign of courage on that front.

Mark

I just want to add here, what should be an argument in length, following
on the lead of What's the Matter with Kansas (years ago and among other
sources including critical theory), that what's been achieved is something
the Democrats almost never have, symbolic capital. This has been a main-
stay of the Republican party, from religion (the Democrats will take our
Bibles away)  to Gay rights (our children will be corrupted) to gun
control (not over my cold dead hands, they're coming over the hill) etc.
etc. Symbolic capital works better than difficult economics and diplomacy
which are, on the horizon, assumed to be tied to it; of course they're
not. Symbolic capital is tied to fear and paranoia and class (Bourdieu's
Distinction) but not in clear-cut ways. For a long time 'NASCAR dads,'
like 'hockey moms' or for that matter 'Joe the Plumber' have worked to the
Republican's favor - this is in a way a tremendous conflation of poetics
with politics (and of course relates to fascist aesthetics as well,
although that might be an uncomfortable fit). The Democrats haven't been
able to mobilize this way for a long time. But just look even at Google
news at this point for foreign reaction - the word 'elation' was used. And
we should never underestimate symbolic capital; it can be used - again as
evident with proposition 8 - for motivation in all sorts of way - and this
time, in this presidential election - for good. - Alan

I'm all for pulling down the wall. Immigration policy is one-sided, unfair,
and privileged, not to mention indicative/symptomatic of the late-crisis of
the nation-state. Having offered my viewpoint of the wall between the US an=
d
Mexico, I'm curious: what do you all suggest be there in place of the wall
and why should we pull it down?

Volume 9 of the poem-work CAMOUFLAGE by Shigeru Matsui has just been
published by The Photographer's Gallery in Tokyo, Japan.

This volume is composed of 84,000 characters ("/" forward slash 42,000
and "\" back slash 42,000) in total.

According to Matsui, CAMOUFLAGE "is a poetic practice about the
palindrome and the anagram, and the text as criticism.  At the same
time it is visual poem.  This poem work's background is Saussure's
anagram study."  The title is taken from the following sentences of
Nabokov's novel The Gift : "Striped and spotted with words, dressed in
verbal camouflage, the important idea he wished to convey would slip
through ..."

Each issue of the series is published as a 20-paged chapbook,
soft-cover.  Volume 9 is incredibly beautiful.

For more information, see the web-site for The Photographer's Gallery at

Thank you Sharon/David. This historic moment is like a moonrock to me,

Alan,

It is great to see you gushing. The truth is I agree with you. My son and I
were celebrating drinking the beer he had brought from his visit to Maine
watching T.V. I couldn't still believe it when Pennsylvania went to Obama.
We learnt of Obama's projection as the next president while we were watching
Comedy Central (my son's choice). Suddenly John Stewart wrote something on a
board and turned it to the audience. It announced Obama as the winner. Wow!
Then Stewart, Colbert and the whole crew left the staged, went up the stairs
of the building to the roof. It was daylight. The, I think Stewart asked,
"is this way the way the world looks without Bush, then, the scene showed a
deer gamboling in the field... It felt like a miracle, not very different
from the way you (and I) are feeling today.

It was a miracle. Millions and millions of white Americans entered the
privacy of the voting booth and chose a black man for president.

Alan, do you remember the exchange you and I had on the list after Kerrey's
defeat? We agreed that it was foolish to deny or look down upon the
religious feeling among the population in the United States. Are your
comments on the power of symbols about the same thing?

Ciao,

Murat

Replace the wall with a place for migrant workers to get registration and w=

e such places on this side of the border because the corrupt socialist gove=

 country to find work. Also, ending the war on drugs here and there would e=

Actually, I do think that's a good analogy for what the poet does: as poets, we are bringing new worlds into existence, new sons, even. And we so love the world that we give our begotten sons to it. Those who believe in those poems enough to want to reproduce their beauty will gain everlasting life in their own creations.

I'm not immune to symbolism. but I was around for the last national feel-good. It was great, desperate fun, though it didn't change nearly as much of what needed and needs to be changed as we hoped.

A response "from a poet" seems to imply that those who disagree aren't. That aside, "it's the job of the poet to love the world" sounds like "so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son." Or maybe "its's the job of cheerleaders to sleep with quarterbacks." Taking part in the game of power is a form of self-seduction and maybe self-delusion. It's the job of the poet to write poems, and that comes in many forms. For me the poem is a tool of investigation, as cold and clear-eyed as I can make it. It's fine by me if others prefer to write coronation anthems.

Here's a piece of world-loving Obama could practice.

The US government leases vast amounts of land in the mountain west at nominal rents to ranchers. This land has been overgrazed for generations. Even so, there's not enough grass or a long enough season to bring the cattle up to markey weight, so the major roads of the high prairie are lined with feedlots which poison the air with the stench of urine and incidentally degrade the aquifers beneath them, where the cattle are force-fed corn grown in Illinois and Iowa. The overgrazed land is at the headwaters of our major rivers, into which increased, in places catastrophic, erosion drains. It also contributes to flooding. So everybody downstream is affected. The damage already done to the grazing lands is irreversible.

Even with all the freebies, and ignoring the damage, it's inordinately expensive to produce beef this way, which is why killer tariffs have been imposed on free-range Argentine beef, at a cost to our diplomatic standing.

One can ignore the damage done in a time of impending water shortages, but not the unlegislated tax levied on every bite of steak.

The leasing of grazing land and the rent charged is largely a matter of executive branch policy, not legislation. It's not a sustainable practice. Much of it could be changed with a stroke of the executive pen. But that would anger voters in corn-growing states and in the cattle-rearing states of the mountain west, newly-democratic Colorado among them each of which have voters and two senators, largely funded by big agribusiness companies and mining and oil-and-gas interests (that's a whole other topic), whose votes are needed for things that make life easier for folks who live in areas where the population exceeds 2 per square mile.

I'd maybe trade my only-begotten son for a sign of courage on that front.

Mark

Join artists Amy Balkin and David Buuck for a San Francisco Nonsite Event:

Wednesday, November 12
6 - 8 pm
SF Camerawork
657 Mission Street, 2nd Floor
Montgomery BART Station
(around the corner from SFMOMA)
5 - 10 dollars sliding scale
3 dollars, students

San Francisco-based artist Amy Balkin will discuss her recent work and
practices as they intersect with the politics and economics of place.
Balkin's projects consider the social and material landscapes we inhabit.
They include *This is the Public Domain* (2001+), *Public Smog* (2004+),
and the audio tour collaboration *Invisible-5* (2006). Her most recent
work is *Sell Us Your Liberty, or We=E2=80=99ll Subcontract Your Death* (20=
08),
a series of large-format rubbings taken from architectural signage of San
Francisco Bay Area entities engaged in the local production of war.

More on Balkin's projects:
http://www.thisisthepublicdomain.org
http://www.publicsmog.org
http://invisible5.org/

David Buuck will present recent investigations by BARGE - the Bay Area
Research Group in Enviro-aesthetics - with a focus on the recent Buried
Treasure Island project. BARGE has organized several (de)tours around the
Bay Area, investigating regional sites & spaces that are underrepresented
& overlooked in more conventional touristic, commercial, & socio-political
notions of place & public space. BARGE investigates how vernacular
landscapes =E2=80=94 from highways & billboards to waterfronts & public
utilities, from industrial lots & server farms to military bases &
surveillance zones =E2=80=94 are constructed & inhabited, while also explor=
ing
the ways in which engaged psychogeography can provide new modes of
counter-tourism & activism.

Mark, agreed, on most...(poems do seem like interrogations of language, or
spelunking the spuyten duyvil). But this text I've quoted above seems a bit
inclusive -- with seemingly unfair breadth -- aren't you lumping *all of us*
in with this?

Poets for Health Care, A Benefit Reading

There is a growing movement across the U.S. to support a single-payer,
national health care system that would provide health care for all.
Currently, over 47 million Americans are without health insurance and
another 50 million are under-insured. More than 18,000 people die every yea=
r
because they have no medical insurance. Since we know that so many poets
have difficulty finding affordable, quality health care, The Poetry Project

Insurance Must Go Coalition. Featured poets, performers, and speakers

mess.  many blessings for both your words.  gabe

Just a little nitpicking:

>>The percentage of black voters wasn't much bigger than in previous years,
by the way.

Actually, it was: it went up from 11% of total voters in 2004 to 13% of
total voters this year.  That's an increase of almost 20%.

Dear Supporters of Public Education,

Many of you have by now heard the rumor that NYC School Chancellor Joel
Klein is being considered as Obama's pick for Secretary of Education.
(http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/31/obamas-secretary-of-educa_n_13977=
5.html
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/04/AR200811040=
4573.html)

As people committed to public education, this strikes a hard and fast blow
in the euphoria that we have felt since Tuesday.  But it's not too late to
make our voices heard once again.  Let's build on the sense of
representation and democracy we have just experienced to send a clear
message to the Obama Administration to STOP THE DE-KLEIN of PUBLIC
EDUCATION.  Community organizations across the New York City and country
are teaming up with The Nation to write a communal letter and petition to
the Obama Administration on why Klein is a mistake for this position.

This is where we need your help! Please submit to the Nation a bullet
point of a few sentences of why you think Klein's appointment would be a
mistake.  This should be based on your experience in education as a
student, teacher, parent, organizer, etc.  If appropriate, include
relevant data or citations.  Also include your name and affiliation/role.
Here is an example:

-Rather than take the advice of educational experts, Chancellor Klein
repeatedly championed and implemented policies that support corporate
interests and Mayor Bloomberg.  For example, in 2004, Bloomberg and Klein
ignored the input of parents, teachers and educational experts in their
attempt to push through a high stakes third grade testing policy.
Despite testimonials from educational experts and community members
against this plan, Bloomberg fired and replaced members of their advisory
panel that were not going to vote to pass their bill.  "Although Mr. Klein
said they had resigned, the three panel members said in interviews that
they had been tersely dismissed and had intended to vote against the
mayor's plan (New York Times, 2004)=94. Is this how we want federal
education policy handled?- Bree Picower, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, New
York University

Particular themes that you could write about:
-issues of community voice and input
-corporate/private interest vs. public interest
-Issues of instruction and curriculum
-particular issues: high stakes testing, military recruitment, school
safety policies, special ed, ELL...
-union representation/ treatment
-Issues around race, racism, and representation
-Issues of equity
-transparency and public decision making
-etc.

Please send your submissions to The Nation ASAP at habiba@thenation.com
and cc: info@nycore.org Please also post your submission to the Education
Section of Obama's Website at http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/mypolicy.

This article is going online on Monday, so time is of the essence!
Bree, NYCoRE/NYU

Well, as I said a few months ago,
finally, the differences wont be that high.
We will still have a US president.
I dont think he will stop the anti-Cuban blockade.
I dont think he will get the bombers and shooters out of Afghanistan and Iraq.
I think that before his four years are up he will bomb or invade at least one small country.
I dont expect universal health care.
The wall along the Mexican border will not come down.
The CIA will still operate Colombia.
etc

It does feel a little nice, though.

Just to be clear on a few points. My reaction is a bit more copmplex
than joy vs. bitterness. Bush and company are gone, cause enough for
bonfires in the street, and we can assume a government run at least
with consistent attention and a greater efficiency, a whole lot more
secularism, and a degree of liberalism. But I mentioned the gay
rights and affirmative action losses as a reminder that the souls of
Americans may not have changed that much.

Neither Gore nor Kerry were running against eight years of Bush.

"Perhaps the world _can_ be changed - I think it so - but not at the
rate that will satisfy a lot of people." This is the crux. Gradual
change has been what we usually get in the US, at the best of times.
In deep crises--the civil war, the depression--and with a government
that's willing to take chances--the rate has changed. The crisis
creates opportunity for boldness. The only exception I can think of
was Lyndon Johnson's civil rights reforms, which grew out of the
civil rights movement and the turmoil in the south, while the rest of
the country was relatively calm.

The problem now is that much of what faces Obama is scarcely felt on
a day to day basis by most voters but nonetheless is a crisis of
enormous proportions. Gradualism will be catastrophic. Even without
global warming the environment world wide is at a breaking
point--inadequate water supplies, terrible pollution, degradation of
fertility, the emptying of the oceans, plagues, the globalization of
diseases that threaten food production--while population just keeps
growing (as we reassure ourselves that it may stabilize at a mere 50%
higher than it is today). In the context of Americam politics even
the most rational measures look like desperate choices. We need
desperate choices.

Obama thus far has offered some kind of health plan, nothing near
what's needed, but that mostly is local, within the US. And he
proposes green energy, which sounds nice and in the not-so-long-run
is a lot more important. But the question in my mind is what he's
willing to risk to get there--what will be needed is a scrapping, at
enormous cost, of much of the energy infrastructure we have now , an
infrastructure that a lot of people are committed to. A radical
change in the way we produce food and manage land and ocean. And an
exponential increase in international cooperation, which would be
read, accurately, as an erosion of sovereignty. This against the
backdrop of an educational system on the point of collapse, so that
fewer and fewer have the capacity to absorb the information they need
to absorb in order to be swayed to action.

We're really at a tipping-point. Humans appear to have surpassed the
carrying capacity of the planet, at least as currently organized. For
Americans the likely downward trend will be so gradual that it won't
register as a crisis, the kind that can generate major change, until
way late in the game.

Which means that the risks Obama will have to take are all the
greater. I'd be a lot happier if he had Gore's sense of urgency and
willingness to communicate it. He has to create a sense of crisis
approaching panic to accomplish what needs to be done.

I don't see that he has anything like that degree of ambition.

So my joy is somewhat tempered. Better the result we got than the
alternative. And it's nice to have a party. Now let's see what happens.

"Gays and lesbians stood up for civil rights in Montgomery, Selma, in
Albany, Ga. and St. Augustine, Fla., and many other campaigns of the Civil
Rights Movement. Many of these courageous men and women were fighting for my
freedom at a time when they could find few voices for their own, and I
salute their contributions."


THIS is something the voters of California needed to think about.  THIS is
something Obama and Biden need to think about.  The campaign against the
queer community among Democrats will leave a vile taste in my mouth for many
years.  I will NEVER forget Biden's comments at his debate with Palin where
he said that if a queer's partner is dying in the hospital that that good
little queer should be allowed to visit.  THANKS JOE, for ALLOWING us to be
a recognized, an actual group of human beings to be recognized WHEN WE'RE
DYING!  But not before?  I voted for him, but I don't like him!

It is hard for me to imagine people with hope and Love and excitement,
voting for Obama, AS THEY SHOULD HAVE FELT, AS I MYSELF FELT WHEN VOTING FOR
HIM, but then, in that moment where the idea of civil rights struggle came
to bear on the voting machine THEY TURN to repress another group.

It's startling.

It's unforgivable.

People must be told when they have done something unforgivable.  And I DON'T
CARE if Prop 8 is overturned, The People still turned to violence in the
booth, one more time.  It must NOT be forgiven!

GARY METRAS: FOUNDER OF THE ADASTRA PRESS


( a very young Gary Metras)


GARY METRAS: FOUNDER OF THE ADASTRA PRESS

BY DOUG HOLDER



Gary Metras is the editor, publisher, and printer of the Adastra Press wh=
ich
specializes in handcrafted chapbooks of poetry. The American Book Review
said of Adastra: =93As long as fine literary presses continue to handcraf=
t
handsome books like these from Adastra, serious readers can rest assured
that the book is alive and well.=94 Metras has worked with such renowned =
poets
as: Thomas Lux and Ed Ochester, but has published many debut collections =
as
well.

Metras is a well-regarded poet in his own right. Recently the Pudding Hou=
se
Press released his collection =93Greatest Hits: 1980-2006.=94 He has been=
 widely
published in the small press, and is a featured poet in current issue of =
the
literary magazine: =93Ibbetson Street.=94 Metras has read at the Massachu=
setts
College of Liberal Arts, and he teaches writing at Springfield College in=

Springfield, Mass. I talked with him on my Somerville Community Access TV=

show: =93Poet to Poet: Writer to Writer=94



Doug Holder: You specialize in chapbooks. Why chaps as opposed to perfect=

bound books?

Gary Metras: I guess because my first two books were chapbooks done by sm=
all
presses during the Mimeograph Revolution. One of the books was published =
by
the Samizdat Press and the other was self published. The production quali=
ty
was so shoddy; I thought there had to be a better way to do it. I thought=

poetry deserves to look better on the page. But still, I was very happy t=
o
have them out there in print. When the opportunity came about I took a ni=
ght
course at a local vocational school in printing and graphic arts. I wante=
d
to learn letterpress printing.


DH: Define letterpress printing.

GM: It is relief type. The actual type is pressed against the paper to be=

printed=97it leaves the image, as opposed to offset=97the printing plate =
never
touches the paper. The printed plate transfers the image to a rubber roll=
er
and the roller touches the paper. Letterpress goes back to Gutenberg.

DH: And what is a chapbook? Where does the name derive from?

GM: The chapbook comes from the pushcart salesman in old London. That is
where the name of the small press literary award the Pushcart Prize comes=

from. So the pushcart street vendors used to carry these little tracts. T=
hey
were cheaply done on paper with a soft cover. They were all paperback
formats. They were all sewn back then because stapling wasn=92t around an=
d
neither was glue binding. They were cheap books, or chapbooks=97they mean=
 the
same thing.



The length of a chapbook can vary according to the publisher. The standar=
d
length is 24 pages. Most chapbooks don=92t have a spine, they are stapled=
 or
sewn. I do mine with a spine, it looks more elegant. And it is a better
marketing tool in bookstores. The spine makes a huge difference. My
chapbooks look like real books, just slimmer. I know the American Poetry
Society is publishing four poetry chapbooks a year now.

DH: Did you apprentice with any printers?

GM: No. I am self-taught. But I use a couple of other publishers as my
models. I have taken books apart to see how they are put together. I read=

the old texts like Blumenthal=92s =93The Art of Printing.=94

DH: You have a number of poetry collections to your credit. Do you hold y=
our
poetry to the same standards as your publishing?

GM: This is something that I began to realize. I was subconsciously writi=
ng
my own poems, based on the poems I accepted to publish. I found similar
techniques: line breaks, use of metaphor, etc=85 And I was finding, and I=

don=92t mean to be immodest, that I was better than most of the poets I w=
as
publishing, at least during the early years. I have been well published, =
so
I use my own poetry as the standard.

DH: You said in an interview that a manuscript has to present a =93graphi=
c
challenge=94

GM: As a book publisher, as a person who uses metal type, when I am readi=
ng
a manuscript of poems, I have to find something that challenges me to ext=
end
my own skills. This is in terms of designing and laying out the pages in =
a book.
For instance: I want to know if the title interacts with the body of the
poem, or the stanza formats. It took me years to realize that to be
challenged graphically was part of my selection process. Two years ago I =
did
a book from the poet Leonard Cirino from Oregon. He had submitted to me f=
or
10 years in a row. He came close and finally I picked a long poem of his.=

The reason I chose it was that individual lines of his poem presented vis=
ual
images of what they looked like on the page. Since I can only publish one=
 or
two titles a year, I want the books to make a graphic statement as well.

GM: Name some of your favorite small press poets?

DH: Alan Catlin, Michael Casey (from Lowell, Mass.), D.W. Earhart, and
others. They all have a tremendous working class sensibility.

GM: You are a son of a bricklayer. What did your father think of your poe=
try
publishing?

DH: He thought it was wonderful. I worked with him on weekends when I was=

growing up. He admired the sensibilities of working with your hands. We u=
sed
to drive around Western, Mass. and he would point out buildings and proje=
cts
he worked on. That impressed me as a young boy. Partly it was my desire t=
o
do it with books. The writer who wrote my profile in Poets and Writers
magazine was amazed at my bookshelf=97three feet of Adastra Press books,
representing over 29 years.

DH: How big are your press runs?

GM: We average 250 books per press run.

DH: It is a badge of honor to be published by Adastra.

GM: A young woman, a graduate student at Emerson College in Boston, asked=

her professor Bill Knott, about having a book done by Adastra. Knott said=
:
=93If you want to publish a book do it with Adastra.=94 She did. It is ve=
ry
satisfying to help young poets. You know yourself, as writers, we work
really hard in our loneliness to get our poems down.

DH: You were an English teacher for many years. Why the need for a press?=


GM: Teaching is a mental job. I just felt a lack in my life because I was=
n=92t
working with my hands. It was my heritage.

DH: You published Tom Sexton=92s =93Clock with No Hands,=94 It deals with=
 the city
of Lowell, Mass. Lowell has a rich literary heritage. It is the birthplac=
e
of Kerouac; Anne Sexton attended school there, etc=85 Why did this down-a=
t-the
heels- old mill city inspire the literary imagination?

GM: I think the idea of physical sweat when you work for someone else to
make a product, accumulates, and steals from the soul. And because it can=
 be
so draining of the human spirit, those who have the sensibility to write
about it=97write about it.

Springfield, Mass. I talked with him on my Somerville Community Access TV=

show: =93Poet to Poet: Writer to Writer=94



Doug Holder: You specialize in chapbooks. Why chaps as opposed to perfect=

bound books?

Gary Metras: I guess because my first two books were chapbooks done by sm=
all
presses during the Mimeograph Revolution. One of the books was published =
by
the Samizdat Press and the other was self published. The production quali=
ty
was so shoddy; I thought there had to be a better way to do it. I thought=

poetry deserves to look better on the page. But still, I was very happy t=
o
have them out there in print. When the opportunity came about I took a ni=
ght
course at a local vocational school in printing and graphic arts. I wante=
d
to learn letterpress printing.


DH: Define letterpress printing.

GM: It is relief type. The actual type is pressed against the paper to be=

printed=97it leaves the image, as opposed to offset=97the printing plate =
never
touches the paper. The printed plate transfers the image to a rubber roll=
er
and the roller touches the paper. Letterpress goes back to Gutenberg.

DH: And what is a chapbook? Where does the name derive from?

GM: The chapbook comes from the pushcart salesman in old London. That is
where the name of the small press literary award the Pushcart Prize comes=

from. So the pushcart street vendors used to carry these little tracts. T=
hey
were cheaply done on paper with a soft cover. They were all paperback
formats. They were all sewn back then because stapling wasn=92t around an=
d
neither was glue binding. They were cheap books, or chapbooks=97they mean=
 the
same thing.



The length of a chapbook can vary according to the publisher. The standar=
d
length is 24 pages. Most chapbooks don=92t have a spine, they are stapled=
 or
sewn. I do mine with a spine, it looks more elegant. And it is a better
marketing tool in bookstores. The spine makes a huge difference. My
chapbooks look like real books, just slimmer. I know the American Poetry
Society is publishing four poetry chapbooks a year now.

DH: Did you apprentice with any printers?

GM: No. I am self-taught. But I use a couple of other publishers as my
models. I have taken books apart to see how they are put together. I read=

the old texts like Blumenthal=92s =93The Art of Printing.=94

DH: You have a number of poetry collections to your credit. Do you hold y=
our
poetry to the same standards as your publishing?

GM: This is something that I began to realize. I was subconsciously writi=
ng
my own poems, based on the poems I accepted to publish. I found similar
techniques: line breaks, use of metaphor, etc=85 And I was finding, and I=

don=92t mean to be immodest, that I was better than most of the poets I w=
as
publishing, at least during the early years. I have been well published, =
so
I use my own poetry as the standard.

DH: You said in an interview that a manuscript has to present a =93graphi=
c
challenge=94

GM: As a book publisher, as a person who uses metal type, when I am readi=
ng
a manuscript of poems, I have to find something that challenges me to ext=
end
my own skills. This is in terms of designing and laying out the pages in =
a book.
For instance: I want to know if the title interacts with the body of the
poem, or the stanza formats. It took me years to realize that to be
challenged graphically was part of my selection process. Two years ago I =
did
a book from the poet Leonard Cirino from Oregon. He had submitted to me f=
or
10 years in a row. He came close and finally I picked a long poem of his.=

The reason I chose it was that individual lines of his poem presented vis=
ual
images of what they looked like on the page. Since I can only publish one=
 or
two titles a year, I want the books to make a graphic statement as well.

GM: Name some of your favorite small press poets?

DH: Alan Catlin, Michael Casey (from Lowell, Mass.), D.W. Earhart, and
others. They all have a tremendous working class sensibility.

GM: You are a son of a bricklayer. What did your father think of your poe=
try
publishing?

DH: He thought it was wonderful. I worked with him on weekends when I was=

growing up. He admired the sensibilities of working with your hands. We u=
sed
to drive around Western, Mass. and he would point out buildings and proje=
cts
he worked on. That impressed me as a young boy. Partly it was my desire t=
o
do it with books. The writer who wrote my profile in Poets and Writers
magazine was amazed at my bookshelf=97three feet of Adastra Press books,
representing over 29 years.

DH: How big are your press runs?

GM: We average 250 books per press run.

DH: It is a badge of honor to be published by Adastra.

GM: A young woman, a graduate student at Emerson College in Boston, asked=

her professor Bill Knott, about having a book done by Adastra. Knott said=
:
=93If you want to publish a book do it with Adastra.=94 She did. It is ve=
ry
satisfying to help young poets. You know yourself, as writers, we work
really hard in our loneliness to get our poems down.

DH: You were an English teacher for many years. Why the need for a press?=


GM: Teaching is a mental job. I just felt a lack in my life because I was=
n=92t
working with my hands. It was my heritage.

DH: You published Tom Sexton=92s =93Clock with No Hands,=94 It deals with=
 the city
of Lowell, Mass. Lowell has a rich literary heritage. It is the birthplac=
e
of Kerouac; Anne Sexton attended school there, etc=85 Why did this down-a=
t-the
heels- old mill city inspire the literary imagination?

GM: I think the idea of physical sweat when you work for someone else to
make a product, accumulates, and steals from the soul. And because it can=
 be
so draining of the human spirit, those who have the sensibility to write
about it=97write about it.

i was thinking that it is exciting to see alan, who can be sad and
dark at times (in a brave and beautiful way), to be speaking of joy
and hope. as a fellow former new yorker where cynicism can rule, i
keep holding on the to these words i hear over and over: i have never
seen anything like this before. quite a few of these people are older
than me. so if only for months, weeks, days, hours--please let us
bask in some glory, in the images of those black and white faces
crying and cheering together, in a park that was home to police
brutality. change seems more possible when fueled with hope and joy
that seemed all but dead in this country. what was alive (if you can
call it alive) was coma-like depression, shame, hopelessness.
hopefully the gay community will have their day of triumph, their
happy tears. this makes that seem possible as well.

I have to say I agree with Sarah; there's definitely a sea change at
work.
A lot of us have a sense of buried joy - I don't know how to put this
- a
kind of disblief that the cold war warriors are on their way out, at
least
for a while - no more cheney, bush, rice, and the rest of the cabal.
We've
lived under a cloud for years and this is different and beautiful, if
only
within the symbolic and possibly more. I _do_ mourn the setbacks to gay
rights and that has to be kept in mind (and as noted that took some
of the
euphoria out of the moment) but we have to be able to open ourselves to
joy, something the left (I think myself among them) almost never
does. The
right certainly has a sense of bitterness at the moment; it seems a
shame
for the left to follow suit. Better to go I think with election parties
(we had one), the happiness and dancing in the streets - that's also
part
of life. It's not naive and not giving in and not seeing the world with
blinders. It's being joyful.

I certainly don't think _any_ Democrat would have won; Gore didn't or
did
but with hardly a landslide and conditions had been truly evil for a
long
time. This was different - at least in NY the grass-roots voting efforts
were something I'd not seen before, not to this excent, not with
McGovern
or Kennedy, not with anyone.

Perhaps the world _can_ be changed - I think it so - but not at the rate
that will satisfy a lot of people. And it has changed, and that was
reflected in Jesse Jackson's face for example which was haunting and
happy
again in a way I hadn't seen before.

I'm probably one of the more pessimistic people on Poetics, and/but this
may be a time of subtle beauty. The worst thing is to give up hope, to
proceed with business as usual - that just in fact continues business as
usual...

Yes, and
The rich will STILL be with us, with their rapacious demands for EVERYTHING,
leaving others with nothing.

You say you're being "hard" Sarah, but I say that's an understatement.

And frankly I don't like being told what I'm SUPPOSED TO DO as a poet, not
one bit.  Love the world?  Is THAT the goal of poetry, really?  That's a
tidy little box for us, isn't it?

I voted for Obama, but I don't like him in many ways.  From his speeches he
proves to want to extend Clinton's terror against the poor, maintain the
absence of safety and care for those who need it most.

In my most hopeful side I hope many of the imperious things he said were to
get elected, and the he will in turn actually act as a man of conscience,
like I hope him to be.  But as Nader points out, Obama has "indentured"
himself to corporate action and benefit, much like Clinton before him.

The biggest problem is that the Republicans were so rotten to Obama that we
focus on their lies and disinformation about him, instead of really
listening to what he says about Welfare Reform, for instance.  He was pretty
quick to hand over the dough when the Dow went south.  It was a rotten trick
to play, playing at The Most critical time, but they played it out, and they
won, yet again.

It feels like a reality TV show of the most decadent, most well hammered
orchestration.  The Good, and The Bad, and The Bad makes everyone angry
about what he says about The Good, and then The Good pushes back and we FEEL
for him, and vote for him, even though he artfully states, so eloquently
states, that it's simply not a good idea to help the poor.  But he says he
feels badly for them, which counts, right?

I voted for Obama because he was against the war.  If Hillary Clinton had
won the nomination I would have voted for Nader and apologized to no one.  I
will NEVER vote for someone who voted for the Nazi occupation of Iraq.

i hate getting embroiled in politics on a poetry list serve, but i
have to say that as long as Obama has said he is against gay marriage
and States like California actually are allowed to repeal gay
marriage or disallow it thru these weirdo propositions, i feel
uncomfortable with any kind of celebration.

our own current crappy government here in Canada is anti
gay  everything, but luckily, in the minority and hampered by our
Supreme Court (shows you that miracles can happen).

Amanda in Ontario, Canada where you can come and get married if
you're gay or lesbian or straight.

It was due to James' urging that New Writers' Press printed a small,
pirated, chapbook of Spicer's *Billy the Kid* (in '68, I think). The title
of NWP's house journal, *The Lace Curtain*, was also down to his suggestion.
It always amused him.

I didn't ever know him closely - I recall our last conversation over a pint
in Leeson Street in '76, where it became quickly evident that neither of us
really got what the other was at - but I was always aware of his very
practical generosity towards young poets and those on hard times. I'm sorry
to hear that he's gone.

I was of course referring to the sixties, which despite everything
was a time of an outpouring of great joy, a time when many of us felt
that with just a bit more work essential changes could be achieved.

Do you really think that anyone who isn't singing in the street right
now is your enemy? Didn't you notice that my skepticism about Obama
is from the left?

If it hasn't been obvious, I'd love to be proven spectacularly wrong.

Ryan: I was saying something quite different about poetry. Of course
it involves an interrogation of language, but also of all
communication and all perception. It's how I home in on that elusive
thing, the real world, and ways of relating to it.

YOur statement only makes sense if there is a fixed pie, meaning if one person gets more, another gets less (also known as a zero-sum game). That's not even remotely how the real world works. In the real world, free exchange benefits both parties. Thus, wealth is created. The rich get richer because the engage in more trades than others. But that is only in a market system. In a government-controlled system, the rich get richer through theft, in which case, your model is correct. In a market economy, the richer the rich get, the richer the poor get. In a government-controlled economy, the richer those in government get, the poorer everyone else gets. This is how the real world works, and not just based on economic models, but on the evidence of history.

As for your poetry, love the world or hate the world, that's up to you. It makes little sense to give a gift to one you hate, though. Of course, gifts are something of value, intended to benefit the one they are given to. What are your poems, then?

Yes, and
The rich will STILL be with us, with their rapacious demands for EVERYTHING,
leaving others with nothing.

You say you're being "hard" Sarah, but I say that's an understatement.

And frankly I don't like being told what I'm SUPPOSED TO DO as a poet, not
one bit.  Love the world?  Is THAT the goal of poetry, really?  That's a
tidy little box for us, isn't it?

I voted for Obama, but I don't like him in many ways.  From his speeches he
proves to want to extend Clinton's terror against the poor, maintain the
absence of safety and care for those who need it most.

In my most hopeful side I hope many of the imperious things he said were to
get elected, and the he will in turn actually act as a man of conscience,
like I hope him to be.  But as Nader points out, Obama has "indentured"
himself to corporate action and benefit, much like Clinton before him.

The biggest problem is that the Republicans were so rotten to Obama that we
focus on their lies and disinformation about him, instead of really
listening to what he says about Welfare Reform, for instance.  He was pretty
quick to hand over the dough when the Dow went south.  It was a rotten trick
to play, playing at The Most critical time, but they played it out, and they
won, yet again.

It feels like a reality TV show of the most decadent, most well hammered
orchestration.  The Good, and The Bad, and The Bad makes everyone angry
about what he says about The Good, and then The Good pushes back and we FEEL
for him, and vote for him, even though he artfully states, so eloquently
states, that it's simply not a good idea to help the poor.  But he says he
feels badly for them, which counts, right?

I voted for Obama because he was against the war.  If Hillary Clinton had
won the nomination I would have voted for Nader and apologized to no one.  I
will NEVER vote for someone who voted for the Nazi occupation of Iraq.

I've thought about this, and the outcome should not be all that shocking to those who understand the world views of African-Americans and Hispanics. The civil rights movement is applicable only to those whose attributes are an accident of birth. Everyone would agree that one does not choose what race one is born as, but for many, especially in the African-American and Hispanic communities, which are very religiously conservative, homosexuality is a choice. From that perspective, it makes sense that one would not necessarily support civil rights for a group who chose to be who they are. Of course, I do not think choice comes into the matter when it comes to sexual orientation, and I do not find it reasonable to expect people to go against their fundamental natures. Throw in the fact that I don't think it's the government's business to have a say about who gets married, and I'm all for a more open definition of marriage which includes same-sex unions.

If homosexuals are looking for a political party favorable to their issues, they should all join the Libertarian Party. Besides, the LP is the only party that supports the naturally-occurring free market economy, meaning they are much more prone to have positions reflecting reality anyway.

THIS is something the voters of California needed to think about.  THIS is
something Obama and Biden need to think about.  The campaign against the
queer community among Democrats will leave a vile taste in my mouth for many
years.  I will NEVER forget Biden's comments at his debate with Palin where
he said that if a queer's partner is dying in the hospital that that good
little queer should be allowed to visit.  THANKS JOE, for ALLOWING us to be

It is hard for me to imagine people with hope and Love and excitement,
voting for Obama, AS THEY SHOULD HAVE FELT, AS I MYSELF FELT WHEN VOTING FOR
HIM, but then, in that moment where the idea of civil rights struggle came
to bear on the voting machine THEY TURN to repress another group.

It's startling.

It's unforgivable.

O
Forty Acres: a poem for Barack Obama from Nobel winner Derek Walcott

Out of the turmoil emerges one emblem, an engraving =97
a young Negro at dawn in straw hat and overalls,
an emblem of impossible prophecy, a crowd
dividing like the furrow which a mule has ploughed,
parting for their president: a field of snow-flecked cotton
forty acres wide, of crows with predictable omens
that the young ploughman ignores for his unforgotten
cotton-haired ancestors, while lined on one branch, is a tense
court of bespectacled owls and, on the field's receding rim =97
a gesticulating scarecrow stamping with rage at him.
The small plough continues on this lined page
beyond the moaning ground, the lynching tree, the tornado's
black vengeance,
and the young ploughman feels the change in his veins,
heart, muscles, tendons,
till the land lies open like a flag as dawn's sure
light streaks the field and furrows wait for the sower

Yes re: the power of symbols; but these at least for me must be simultan-
eously denied, thinking of tantric generation deity stage for example. I
was thinking of this in regard of the Other, that evil might just be
objectification and control, aligned and misaligned. If I objectify <x>
than <x> is demarcated for control, even if control is only hell-raising.
Objectification is necessarily reductive, a form of potential well; con-
trol is the exchange-value and/or functionalism of the object. It's an
arena of danger; objectification resonates also with the organism doing
it, and control likewise restricts the controller. This isn't a master-
slave dialectic (which I find absurd) but in fact the reification of the
master, who is hardened into position and positionality - a kind of
resonance is at work. So symbolic capital tends towards these moments or
processes, inheres within them; what is objectified is also symbolized,
and control is the playing out and/or accrual of capital.

What the ducks?

Troy, I don't know whether to laugh at this comment or just ask you to
explain to substantiate this. I do agree that the US should foster market
reforms in Mexico (the first way our govt. can do this is by killing the
street price of drugs, as you pointed out.

Any other ideas? I'm curious (as  I mentioned) because I hear,  GORBY, tear
down this wall, and it's always unclear what the utterer means to replace
the wall with...

Granted, it should not have been built, but what's happens to fill the spac=
e
left by the wall?

           Hello!  We are planning an off-site event, combining Music
& Talk for the MLA this year. Trying not to conflict with any of the
official events, but tentatively thinking about the EVENING OF
DECEMBER 28th.  Please let me know if you'll be visiting town and are
interested in reading/dancing/singing/performing, etc. TALK pieces
especially welcome. Send proposals backchannel to me at
Chris.Stroffolino@gmail.com. Or www.myspace.com/startoor

We'll try to accommodate as many visiting authors, writers,
musicians, and performers as possible. The site the historic "China
House" near Jack London square in Oakland. A quick ride on BART from
the MLA hotel area.

Chris Stroffolino,

Axel's Bar, just down and over a few blocks from the UWM campus is where
we'd all gather to drink ourselves happy, then silly, then under.
Around about midnight James Liddy would roll in with his bevy of young
men,-- sweating, gouty and grinning--always grinning, to share the
latest gossip or introduce one to a visiting poet (I met John Montague,
and John Ashbery, among others, by the dim flicker of Axel's bar
lights) or a publisher.  He was a fine, generous soul--a good teacher
and a great party-giver, and a roaring sinner but his stories about
Patrick Kavanaugh were the best.  We both shared a love for the poetry
of James Clarence Mangan, but only James and his Irish crew maintained a
flame for the moustached Frank, Axel's legendary bar-tender.  Rest in
peace, James. Rest long and well.  I hope Jim Chapson is weathering it
all and keeping fine--haven't seen him in years.  I'll be thinking
again about those days and nights, and breaking out James Liddy's books
to catch his voice rising like Irish fiddles above that of Jack
Spicer's.  Jess

It's interesting to read the range of "poet responses" as they move from
wonder and joy through to the scalpel Mark Weiss writes of wielding.
I think the person I feel closest with is CA Conrad--one heard so little of
any substance during this two years one billion dollar plus campaign--
one billion dollars to become President-!! that alone makes one wonder if
the word "democracy" really applies--becuase in order to acquire al this
backing money, as CA noted, the candidate has to start making compromises,
selling apound of flesh here and antoher there--dropping old friends along
the way, changing old beleifs one has cherished for decades overnight--

and now the names of the advisers and cabinet are starting to emerge it's as
CA noted--the return of the neo-liberals--Rahm Emanuel and company--who are
hard core on the side of the corporations----who under Clinton brought the
US NAFTA--and at the same dropped more bombs than any previous American
administration--

   In our neighborhood in the West Central City in Milwaukee, there was some
yelling and screaming and a few cars zooming about briefly honking horns --
their passengers' yells joining those of the others on foot--

But the neighborhood is under a form of lockdown, so, as in the NFL, "no
excessive celebrating" after a point, and the yelling and honking couldn't
go on very long. The new Police Chief decided upon this area, known
nefariously for eons as "Crack Alley"--as the starting point for a proposed
series of clean up operations.  For months now--a half year--there are
police on foot, bikes, in cars and unmarked cars, under cover officers and
detectives and the neighborhood watch, too, so that things have been
relatively subdued. All the same the dope dealers and prostitutes manage to
ply their trades, as they will until the end of time.

This situation expresses in its tensions between joy and wariness the way
that many people feel. It is a momentous and great joy that Obama is
elected--but what comes next is what people are wary of.  Everyone has seen
all too often how a position of power can alter a person one thought one
once knew, and also people know that though "the faces may change, the game
remains the same." How much will really change in the over all system of
American political, economic and military life? How much will really change
of real substance in the culture?

Language in the USA has been very affected since 9/11, become often a way of
not saying anything seen as troublesome--and at the same time turning
steadily into a doubletalk, with a reduced vocabulary leading to the
Orwellian concept of the words which cancel themselves out by holding at the
same time a meaning and its exact opposite--

It's a language designed to keep people from asking too many questions, and
from looking too closely at what the implications of events are.

For example, while the US is basking in the glow of its diversity and
equality--and feeling that it is once again Number One as "exemplar to the
World--

will this make a dent at al in the massive funding, military support and
backing the US pours out for an Apartheid state?

It is not only the truly great challenges which lie ahead in terms of the
economy, the environment, ending the wars (which Obama has spoken of
extending to being the "Right War"--)--but also the moral challenges--the
cultural challenges--

Remember, that the presidency now with al the new laws passed  since 9/11 is
but a couple of baby steps away from becoming a dictatorship--and the only
real partners to share this power with will be the corporations, the banks
and military--

Thank yous to the people who have written not to forget the persons who
worked for campaigns, and for the voters who showed up and voted.  Tolstoy
in War and Peace wrote that it is not the Napoleons who change history
finally, but the anonymous, "little" people.  That's why every effort is
always made to keep people in a state of unawareness as much as possible,
and fil them up with as many lies as possible, so as not to wake this
sleeping giant.

Perhaps someday as people see that their votes count, they may begin to
realize why it is so many countries are enemies of America,which, not
pleased by the outcomes of democratic elections in this country or that,
immediately sets about destroying it as much as possible.

Look at  the atrocities that have happened to Gaza as the price for
democratically electing the "wrong people," or the efforts made and ongoing
by the US to subvert the elected governments of Bolivia, Paraguay,
Venezuela.  They join the long long list of US denial and overthrow of
others' democratically elected governments from Guatemala, Iran, Vietnam
Nicaragua to Chile to name a few.

As Americans, one celebrates a great moment in the history of this nation--a
truly great event, very deeply felt.--

Yet will this lead to a complaisance, and the holding to the same old same
old disregard for the democracies and rights of other peoples?  Having
elected the "right" President who is for fighting the "right" Wars, wil the
celebration of democracy, diversity and equality be one for only the "right"
peoples of our choosing around the world?

Will the new mood of celebration forget to include the indigenous peoples
whom the US still excludes, as the US  does not recognize and did not sign
the International Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which gave the Indian Evo
Morales of Bolivia to have the opportunity to run for President?

Is this a truly great change in the American people that will lead to
changes in their treatment of others outside the US?  Will there begin to be
a realization that our celebration at the same time supports Apartheid and
ethnic cleansing in many areas?  That in order to be elected, a Black
President had to swear fealty to an Apartheid regime--and speak of the
expansion of wars against the Muslim world most particularly?

The post 9/11 laws and Acts give the President powers the writers of the
Constitution tried to prevent, and the erosion of civil liberties means that
any person is subject to being detainee without limit for appearing to be
opposed to things as they are in some vaguely defined way.  The President
-elect voted for the bail outof the banks, and despite the little warning
given by the elected officials, the CEOs who created this debacle all the
same have given themselves substantial bonuses to celebrate their having
succeeded so marvelously at ripping off billions and being bailed out of
trouble for doing so. In other words, some may be indefinitely disappeared
for next to no reasons, while others are rewarded for openly defrauding
citizens and the government both of billions.

That's why I thought the yelling and hollering I joined in with that lasted
briefly and stopped due to common sense awareness of being inhabitants of
"an occupied territory" so to speak, is a positive state of critical
awareness, feeling great joy, yet also wariness,  not rushing in like a herd
behind the leaders, in case where it leads is to the same old same old or,
who knows, even worse . . .

Work and awareness, by the people, to keep the elected ones on their toes
and working for these--they didn't do so after their elections in 2006 after
all-- may bring real change. Asking questions, rather than stopping, sated
with satisfaction and righteousness--as though the answers have been made--
or, change may simply be as the Italian writer Lampedusa wrote of it:  "to
change everything so that nothing is changed."
With a completely different "structure of feeling," "we" may find ourselves
still doing the same things--
only instead of being gloomy about wars and invasions due to who is in
office, perhaps instead we may become gung ho--awash in an awakening of a
new found patriotism that still serves the same old ends though one can now
feel "good about it" rather than "depressed." Instead of singing Obama! we
may be singing O bombah! as "the rockets red glare and bombs bursts in
air"--
Having "proved American is no longer racist," doesn't this free the nation
to act in a racist way without being criticized for it, because it can say,
why obviously we are not?
In terms of language there may be the creation of a whole new form of
doubletalk than has previously existedm in which the feel good self can find
easier softer ways of hiding its moral and intellectual contradictions from
itself.

All these things are possible and have happened before.

So while I am deeply moved and happy in a way almost out of reach of wrods,
also one remembers that the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and the
pudding has yet to be set out before one.  It's never a good idea to join a
crowd rushing towards a giant feast that hasn't yet begun to be prepared. As
in the play, one might be turned into a Rhinoceros before one knows it!  And
somebody has to stick around and not be a Rhinoceros, after all--

O
Forty Acres: a poem for Barack Obama from Nobel winner Derek Walcott

Out of the turmoil emerges one emblem, an engraving =E2=80=94
a young Negro at dawn in straw hat and overalls,
an emblem of impossible prophecy, a crowd
dividing like the furrow which a mule has ploughed,
parting for their president: a field of snow-flecked cotton
forty acres wide, of crows with predictable omens
that the young ploughman ignores for his unforgotten
cotton-haired ancestors, while lined on one branch, is a tense
court of bespectacled owls and, on the field's receding rim =E2=80=94
a gesticulating scarecrow stamping with rage at him.
The small plough continues on this lined page
beyond the moaning ground, the lynching tree, the tornado's
black vengeance,
and the young ploughman feels the change in his veins,
heart, muscles, tendons,
till the land lies open like a flag as dawn's sure
light streaks the field and furrows wait for the sower

The controversy about gay marriage is of course based on sexual fear
and hatred, but it remains legally controversial because of a
misunderstanding of marriage, which is really two distinct things.
For the religious, marriage is a sacrament. The social meaning of
marriage-as-sacrament is limited to the church-as-society. But in the
secular world marriage, wherever and however performed, is a contract
between two people, recognized by the state, that binds them legally
and financially.

What if the two functions of marriage were separated, as they are in
fact for many of us?

Churches should have the right to consider whoever they wish
marriageable or not. Excluded couples can always find another church.
But let's restrict the word "marriage" to the sacrament. The secular
rest of us, whether gay or straight, should plight our troths in
civil unions, with the same legal rights as the sacramentally-married.

I suspect that if that were the case there'd be a falling-off in
weddings by clerics, followed by a revision of the positions of a lot
of churches. Otherwise, with the fall-off in business it might be
hard to pay for the wine and crackers.

Subject:      Civil Unions vs. Marriage -- "Separate But Equal" [Troy & Mark]
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Troy,

The question of being gay as "natural" or a "choice" is beyond moot.=A0 Sin=
ce the constitution provides everyone equal rights - ahem - I should be all=
owed to marry whomever I choose, so long as they consent and choose me as w=
ell.=A0 To devolve into such debate over whether the selection of one's spo=
use is a choice, a coercion, a divine intervention, a prophetic union, or w=
hat-have-you is to distract from the purposes & securities provided by the =
constitution.=A0 That we *must* be separated by gender was not something ou=
r forefathers predicted would be problematic -- any more than when they wro=
te that some people weren't exactly human and could be owned as chattel.=A0=
=20

But in an age when it is beginning to be acknowledged that gender lines are=
, at best, blurred and complex, sexes are multiple (despite "corrective" me=
asures - http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/magazine/24intersexkids.html & h=
ttp://www.jenellerose.com/htmlpostings/intersex_babies_controversy.htm), an=
d, like it or not, gender is fluid, to create an amendment defining marriag=
e as between a "man" and a "woman" is institutionalized bias.=A0 Devolving =
into the archaic debate of just what penis and vagina should be allowed a l=
egally-sanctioned U.S. Gov't issued contract is silly and a distracting fal=
lacy.=A0 Two people should be granted the same rights as any other two peop=
le as written in the constitution.=A0 This debate heralds back to the not-s=
o-old one of whether it was "right" that blacks and whites be allowed the s=
ame rights under the law, as if the races were two different species (see a=
nti-miscegenation laws).=A0 It wasn't so long ago that people thought it
 "unnatural" to see two separate skin tones loving one another.=A0 Some sti=
ll think it "unnatural."=A0=A0 The debate of nature vs nurture is itself a =
perversion.=A0=20

An aside:=A0 I think the passing of Prop 8 speaks moreover to the hope that=
 by denying the GLBT community the right to marry will somehow abolish the =
very existence of that community -- at least, that's my pessimistic read on=
 the whole debacle.=A0=A0 Gays/lesbians are the latest "Other" just as immi=
grants remain "Alien" on the soil of a people obsessed with "getting and ke=
eping theirs."=A0=20


Mark,=20

Separations of symbols vs. legalities not withstanding, civil unions and do=
mestic partnerships do NOT provide the same legal benefits that marriages d=
o.=A0 It's all in the poetic wording, no?=A0=A0 "Separate but equal" has hi=
storically betrayed everyone's "good" intentions.=A0 If "civil unions" were=
 to be federally-mandated, then perhaps that would cover the legal protecti=
ons that marriages do, but until then:


What are some of the limitations of civil unions?

   =20

    Civil unions are different from marriage, and that difference has
    wide-ranging implications that make the two institutions unequal. Here
    is a quick look at some of the most significant differences:=20

   =20

    -Portability:

   =20

    Marriages are respected state to state for all purposes, but questions
    remain about how civil unions will be treated in other states.=A0
    GLAD
    believes there are strong arguments that civil unions deserve respect
    across the country just like marriages. But the two appellate courts
    that have addressed the issue (in Connecticut and Georgia) have
    disrespected them based on the fact that their states do not grant civi=
l unions themselves.

   =20

    -Ending a Civil Union:

   =20

    If you are married, you can get divorced in any state in which you are =
a
    resident. But if states continue to disrespect civil unions, there is
    no way to end the relationship other than by establishing residency in
    Vermont and filing for divorce there. This has already created problems
    for some couples who now have no way to terminate their legal
    commitment.

   =20

    -Federal Benefits:

   =20

    According to a 1997 GAO report, civil marriage brings with it at least
    1,049 legal protections and responsibilities from the federal
    government, including the right to take leave from work to care for a
    family member, the right to sponsor a spouse for immigration purposes,
    and Social Security survivor benefits that can make a difference betwee=
n
    old age in poverty and old age in security. Civil unions bring none of
    these critical legal protections.

   =20

    -Taxes & Public Benefits for the Family:

   =20

    Because the federal government does not respect civil unions, a couple
    with a civil union will be in a kind of limbo with regard to
    governmental functions performed by both state and federal governments,
    such as taxation, pension protections, provision of insurance for
    families, and means-tested programs like Medicaid. Even when states try
    to provide legal protections, they may be foreclosed from doing so in
    joint federal/state programs.

   =20

    -Filling out forms:

   =20

    Every day, we fill out forms that ask us whether we are married or
    single. People joined in a civil union don't fit into either category.
    People with civil unions should be able to identify themselves as a
    single family unit, but misrepresenting oneself on official documents
    can be considered fraud and carries potential serious criminal

    penalties.=20

   =20

    -Separate & Unequal -- Second-Class Status:

   =20

    Even if there were no substantive differences in the way the law treate=
d
    marriages and civil unions, the fact that a civil union remains a
    separate status just for gay people represents real and powerful
    inequality. We've been down this road before in this country and should
    not kid ourselves that a separate institution just for gay people is a
    just solution here either. Our constitution requires legal equality for
    all. Including gay and lesbian couples within existing marriage laws is
    the fairest and simplest thing to do.

   =20

    How real are these differences between marriage and civil unions, given
    that a federal law and some state laws discriminate against all
    marriages of same-sex couples?

   =20

    Would any of this change immediately with marriage of same-sex couples?
    Probably not, because married same-sex couples will face other layers o=
f
    discrimination against their marriages. Right now, a federal law denies
    recognition of same-sex unions conferred by any state for purposes of
    all federal programs and requirements and over 30 state laws do the
    same. Ending discrimination in marriage does not mean the end of all
    discrimination, but using the term "marriage" rather than "civil union"
    is an essential first step to opening the door and addressing whether
    continued governmental discrimination against civil marriages of gay an=
d
    lesbian people makes sense.=20

   =20

    Marriage and civil unions remain different, both in practice and in

    principle.=20

   =20

    First, more than a dozen states have not taken a discriminatory positio=
n
    against civil marriages of gay and lesbian couples. In those states,
    civilly married gay and lesbian couples should be able to live and
    travel freely and without fear that their relationship will be
    disrespected.

   =20

    Second, even as to those states with discriminatory laws, legally
    married gay and lesbian couples from those states may well face some
    discrimination in some quarters, but their marriages will also be
    treated with legal respect in other arenas. Marriages are far more
    likely to be respected by others than newly minted "civil unions."

   =20

    Using the term marriage also prompts a discussion about fairness.
    Allowing same sex couples to marry (rather than enter a separate status=
)
    will allow gay and lesbian people to talk with their neighbors, their
    local elected officials, and the Congress about whether discrimination
    against their marriages is fair. Where gay and lesbian people and their
    children are part of the social fabric, is it right to continue
    discriminating against them in civil marriage? The federal government
    and states that have taken discriminatory positions against marriages o=
f
    gay and lesbian couples could rethink those policies and go back to
    respecting state laws about marriage, as they have done for hundreds of
    years. In the end, we will not be able to have this discussion until
    gay and lesbian folks have what everyone else
    has: civil marriage.

Why trust gay men and women to cut your hair, write your
television shows, do your banking, file your taxwork, drive your buses, ser=
ve
as your councilmen, your senator woman, operate on your bodies, teach your
children, write up your life insurance policies, pay taxes, bag your grocer=
ies,
pour your coffees, sell you clothing, defend your legal cases, act as your
shrink, and in my case, serve as your literature professor, why trust us to
have civic responsibilities, to perform and participate in business, govern=
ment,
religious life, the arts, education. . . and then tell us that you don't
believe we should be able to marry. Why wouldn't you trust us to believe in
love, to choose for ourselves who to make lifelong commitments to, to pursu=
e
the sacred endeavors of a spiritual pursuit with another person, to make fo=
r
ourselves family, to have a ceremony and to have legal rights that endorse =
that
ceremony?

I know many out there believe this is just a small set back,
the whole passage of Prop 8 thing, but it isn't a small thing. For the firs=
t
time in the history of the California Constitution, for the first time, I
believe, for any State Constitution, a majority took away rights from a
minority. Unlike other States, where bans have been written in before the S=
tate
ever granted such rights, this is very different. The only other State that
could understand this is Massachusetts.
And now, I believe, Connecticut.
But in those two States, a lot must take place to reverse same sex marriage
rights because they are deemed Constitutional rights. The populace of the S=
tate
of California
took away rights from an entire group of people. I worked hard to overcome =
my
cynicism on this marriage rights issue over the past 2 years. Why? Because =
I
didn't believe we would ever be granted the right to marry at all. I never
believed it would happen. But I worked to replace my cynicism with somethin=
g
better, something more hopeful. And now, I almost wish I hadn't. Yesterday =
was
the first time as an adult I felt so completely marginalized and dismissed =
by
the people. Yesterday was the first time I felt my belief in humanity
dissipating. Gay people are not significantly different from straight peopl=
e.
We happen to fall in love with people of our own gender as opposed to oppos=
ite
gender. We are your brothers, your sisters, your cousins, your neighbors. W=
e
are your accountants, your grocers, your doctors, your sales clerks, your b=
ank
tellers, your pilots, and so on. Gays and Lesbians are people just like
everyone else. We have the same worries, the same fears. We bleed if you cu=
t
us, just like you. We are not, as some portray us, THE OTHER. We are you. A=
nd
because we are you, taking away our rights and taking away our hopes, hurts=
 us
all. Many straight folks just don't realize it yet. Everyone was hurt by th=
e
passage of Prop 8. They just don't realize it. Now, there will be precedent=
.
Now, there is a precedent for the majority, in the future, to take away rig=
hts
from people for whatever difference they find offensive.

I agree with Mark here. though the majority of people voted against gay
marriage, this does not mean they all or the majority of them are against
civil unions.

I'm aware of all this. For what it's worth, I've been a long-term
contributing member of the California Human Rights Campaign, a gay
activist group that fought hard against Prop 8. I was proposing that
civil unions be precisely the same legally and contractually as
marriage, but totally secular, just as currently in all US
jurisdictions marriage by a Justice of the Peace carries the same
rights and obligations as a church wedding. Case in point, my own
marriage to a woman would have been a civil union under my proposal,
as both of us were atheists and an Elvis chapel in Las Vegas probably
doesn't qualify as a church. If all secular marriages, regardless of
the genders of the participants, were called something other than
marriage any onus attached to the term used would be hard to sustain.
If someone has to yield it, yielding the term marriage to the
churches makes sense. The symbolism invested in the term is largely
their fabrication. Anyway, it's impossible to imagine the various
denominations agreeing to cede the term.
I suspect that for the majority of those who voted for Prop 8 it was
the lumping of secular and sacred under the same term that was at
fault, tho I doubt that they thought it through, and that a clear
separation of the sacramental would largely end the controversy. Of
course, individual churches and denominations could fight it out, but
again, I suspect that a controversy among Mormons, say, would be a
major concern only of Mormons, and not all of them.

I single out Mormons because it was the LDS that funded Prop 8.

I'm of course also aware that what I propose is a utopian fantasy,
given the level of rational discourse in the US.

While we're at it, a ban on the throwing of rice at weddings wouldn't
be a bad thing. Birds eat the grains, which swell in their crops,
killing them. It follows that if we must throw rice it should be precooked.

Unless I am hopelessly naive, or, simply, refuse to accede to the Bush doct=

 and have a positive insistence on the responsiveness and direction of this=
 new government. I realize Pelosi et al rolled over and played dead on Iraq=
, etc. after their victories in 2006 and so it is easy to get pessimistic. =
But it turns my stomach to see people who probably voted for Obama so quick=

I think the real public joy in this election - both visceral and symbolic a=

possible to conceive within this government during these last 8 years).=20

By the way, I have not heard a peep out of anybody about the role of the Ar=

their interests. (Is the Poetry Foundation banging a loud drum - and the on=

What do I know? Maybe the Poetry Foundation has also lost half its value in=

Forty Acres: a poem for Barack Obama from Nobel winner Derek Walcott

Out of the turmoil emerges one emblem, an engraving =97
a young Negro at dawn in straw hat and overalls,
an emblem of impossible prophecy, a crowd
dividing like the furrow which a mule has ploughed,
parting for their president: a field of snow-flecked cotton
forty acres wide, of crows with predictable omens
that the young ploughman ignores for his unforgotten
cotton-haired ancestors, while lined on one branch, is a tense
court of bespectacled owls and, on the field's receding rim =97
a gesticulating scarecrow stamping with rage at him.
The small plough continues on this lined page
beyond the moaning ground, the lynching tree, the tornado's
black vengeance,
and the young ploughman feels the change in his veins,
heart, muscles, tendons,
till the land lies open like a flag as dawn's sure

Sometimes I wonder if anyone actually reads what anyone says and considers their actual arguments or if they just act like politicians and spout off their talking points regardless.

The question of whether or not "being gay" is natural or a choice is not "beyond moot" to those againstgay marriage. To such people, their belief that being gay is a choice has everything to do with it. They would argue that choosing to be gay is like choosing to be a murderer, and insofar as both are immoral, both should be opposed. I, of course, to not consider this to be the case. I too understand that sexuality is fluid and that, as a species, Homo sapiens, like our close relatives the bonobos, are a bisexual species. Less bisexual than bonobos, but more so than chimpanzees. The fact that hazy sexuality is a biological fact in the human species is not moot, and is in fact a benefit to those who want to argue for civil rightsrecognitions. If you want to make any headway on this issue, you have to understand the position of the opposition. "Know your enemy as you know yourself and you will not fail." -- Sun Tzu. The reason so many liberals can't get
 anything done is that you think screeching at the top of your lungs is what gets things done, and you don't even bother to try to argue your point. And your lack of understanding of how people think -- especially religious people -- is what prevents you from understanding how Obama can win the Presidency, but the African-Americans and Hispanics who voted for them voted against the liberal social agenda. I'm trying to explain it to you, and all you have to say is that their reasons, which they consider to be central to their belief system, is merely a "moot point." It's condescending to them, and won't win any arguments with them.

Subject: Civil Unions vs. Marriage -- "Separate But Equal" [Troy & Mark]

Troy,

The question of being gay as "natural" or a "choice" is beyond moot.  Since the constitution provides everyone equal rights - ahem - I should be allowed to marry whomever I choose, so long as they consent and choose me as well.  To devolve into such debate over whether the selection of one's spouse is a choice, a coercion, a divine intervention, a prophetic union, or what-have-you is to distract from the purposes & securities provided by the constitution.  That we *must* be separated by gender was not something our forefathers predicted would be problematic -- any more than when they wrote that some people weren't exactly human and could be owned as chattel.

But in an age when it is beginning to be acknowledged that gender lines are, at best, blurred and complex, sexes are multiple (despite "corrective" measures - http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/magazine/24intersexkids.html & http://www.jenellerose.com/htmlpostings/intersex_babies_controversy.htm), and, like it or not, gender is fluid, to create an amendment defining marriage as between a "man" and a "woman" is institutionalized bias.  Devolving into the archaic debate of just what penis and vagina should be allowed a legally-sanctioned U.S. Gov't issued contract is silly and a distracting fallacy.  Two people should be granted the same rights as any other two people as written in the constitution.  This debate heralds back to the not-so-old one of whether it was "right" that blacks and whites be allowed the same rights under the law, as if the races were two different species (see anti-miscegenation laws).  It wasn't so long ago that people thought it
"unnatural" to see two separate skin tones loving one another.  Some still think it "unnatural."   The debate of nature vs nurture is itself a perversion.

An aside:  I think the passing of Prop 8 speaks moreover to the hope that by denying the GLBT community the right to marry will somehow abolish the very existence of that community -- at least, that's my pessimistic read on the whole debacle.   Gays/lesbians are the latest "Other" just as immigrants remain "Alien" on the soil of a people obsessed with "getting and keeping theirs."


Mark,

Separations of symbols vs. legalities not withstanding, civil unions and domestic partnerships do NOT provide the same legal benefits that marriages do.  It's all in the poetic wording, no?   "Separate but equal" has historically betrayed everyone's "good" intentions.  If "civil unions" were to be federally-mandated, then perhaps that would cover the legal protections that marriages do, but until then:


What are some of the limitations of civil unions?



    Civil unions are different from marriage, and that difference has
    wide-ranging implications that make the two institutions unequal. Here
    is a quick look at some of the most significant differences:



    -Portability:



    Marriages are respected state to state for all purposes, but questions
    remain about how civil unions will be treated in other states.
    GLAD
    believes there are strong arguments that civil unions deserve respect
    across the country just like marriages. But the two appellate courts
    that have addressed the issue (in Connecticut and Georgia) have
    disrespected them based on the fact that their states do not grant civil unions themselves.



    -Ending a Civil Union:



    If you are married, you can get divorced in any state in which you are a
    resident. But if states continue to disrespect civil unions, there is
    no way to end the relationship other than by establishing residency in
    Vermont and filing for divorce there. This has already created problems
    for some couples who now have no way to terminate their legal
    commitment.



    -Federal Benefits:



    According to a 1997 GAO report, civil marriage brings with it at least
    1,049 legal protections and responsibilities from the federal
    government, including the right to take leave from work to care for a
    family member, the right to sponsor a spouse for immigration purposes,
    and Social Security survivor benefits that can make a difference between
    old age in poverty and old age in security. Civil unions bring none of
    these critical legal protections.



    -Taxes & Public Benefits for the Family:



    Because the federal government does not respect civil unions, a couple
    with a civil union will be in a kind of limbo with regard to
    governmental functions performed by both state and federal governments,
    such as taxation, pension protections, provision of insurance for
    families, and means-tested programs like Medicaid. Even when states try
    to provide legal protections, they may be foreclosed from doing so in
    joint federal/state programs.



    -Filling out forms:



    Every day, we fill out forms that ask us whether we are married or
    single. People joined in a civil union don't fit into either category.
    People with civil unions should be able to identify themselves as a
    single family unit, but misrepresenting oneself on official documents
    can be considered fraud and carries potential serious criminal

    penalties.



    -Separate & Unequal -- Second-Class Status:



    Even if there were no substantive differences in the way the law treated
    marriages and civil unions, the fact that a civil union remains a
    separate status just for gay people represents real and powerful
    inequality. We've been down this road before in this country and should
    not kid ourselves that a separate institution just for gay people is a
    just solution here either. Our constitution requires legal equality for
    all. Including gay and lesbian couples within existing marriage laws is
    the fairest and simplest thing to do.



    How real are these differences between marriage and civil unions, given
    that a federal law and some state laws discriminate against all
    marriages of same-sex couples?



    Would any of this change immediately with marriage of same-sex couples?
    Probably not, because married same-sex couples will face other layers of
    discrimination against their marriages. Right now, a federal law denies
    recognition of same-sex unions conferred by any state for purposes of
    all federal programs and requirements and over 30 state laws do the
    same. Ending discrimination in marriage does not mean the end of all
    discrimination, but using the term "marriage" rather than "civil union"
    is an essential first step to opening the door and addressing whether
    continued governmental discrimination against civil marriages of gay and
    lesbian people makes sense.



    Marriage and civil unions remain different, both in practice and in

    principle.



    First, more than a dozen states have not taken a discriminatory position
    against civil marriages of gay and lesbian couples. In those states,
    civilly married gay and lesbian couples should be able to live and
    travel freely and without fear that their relationship will be
    disrespected.



    Second, even as to those states with discriminatory laws, legally
    married gay and lesbian couples from those states may well face some
    discrimination in some quarters, but their marriages will also be
    treated with legal respect in other arenas. Marriages are far more
    likely to be respected by others than newly minted "civil unions."



    Using the term marriage also prompts a discussion about fairness.
    Allowing same sex couples to marry (rather than enter a separate status)
    will allow gay and lesbian people to talk with their neighbors, their
    local elected officials, and the Congress about whether discrimination
    against their marriages is fair. Where gay and lesbian people and their
    children are part of the social fabric, is it right to continue
    discriminating against them in civil marriage? The federal government
    and states that have taken discriminatory positions against marriages of
    gay and lesbian couples could rethink those policies and go back to
    respecting state laws about marriage, as they have done for hundreds of
    years. In the end, we will not be able to have this discussion until
    gay and lesbian folks have what everyone else
    has: civil marriage.

What part is the funny mart? It's certainly corrupt, from top to bottom. An=

O
Forty Acres: a poem for Barack Obama from Nobel winner Derek Walcott

Out of the turmoil emerges one emblem, an engraving =97
a young Negro at dawn in straw hat and overalls,
an emblem of impossible prophecy, a crowd
dividing like the furrow which a mule has ploughed,
parting for their president: a field of snow-flecked cotton
forty acres wide, of crows with predictable omens
that the young ploughman ignores for his unforgotten
cotton-haired ancestors, while lined on one branch, is a tense
court of bespectacled owls and, on the field's receding rim =97
a gesticulating scarecrow stamping with rage at him.
The small plough continues on this lined page
beyond the moaning ground, the lynching tree, the tornado's
black vengeance,
and the young ploughman feels the change in his veins,
heart, muscles, tendons,
till the land lies open like a flag as dawn's sure
light streaks the field and furrows wait for the sower

As I read the responses on this list to Obama's election, my first reaction to those who'd criticize is ARE YOU KIDDING?!? Let's give him a chance to actually take the office and make a few decisions, let's give him a freakin' HONEYMOON for God's sake!

The rest of the world, save Iran and a few other places seem excited:

Yes, here is a vision of an enlightened U.S. leader. How can we not revel in this for a long time. I'm not saying to give him a free hand to continue some of the pernicious policies of the last 8 years, or the last 50 in the case of the US Blockade of Cuba, but let's do cut him some slack, eh?

It has long seemed to me, given the kind of argument put forth by Joe Biden
in the vice-presidential debate, about marriage being a religious issue on
which the state ought not to intrude and his using that as a screen to hide
behind when he says he opposes same-sex marriage, that the solution ought to
be to rename "civil marriage," which has nothing to do with any church, as
"civil union," and then let the religious institutions argue about whether
they want to allow same sex couples to be married within their bounds. After
all, it is not the religious ceremony per se that confers any of the civil
benefits of marriage, and people who want to have the blessing of their
particular church ought to be arguing with that church, not the state. Or
maybe there is something I am missing.

Troy,

I know this will be difficult to admit, but your reply, and often times you=
r style of arguing here, is hypocritical in its condescension.=A0=20

Having grown up on the Bible Belt in Stone Mountain, GA, I used to be one o=
f those "religious people" and, as such, continue to communicate with them.=
=A0 My response to you *is* my response to those religious people you've de=
termined I don't understand.

However, I don't need you to explain to me "how people think" and how to re=
spond, verbatim, to "African Americans and Hispanics" -- for you to be so e=
lementary and condescending is just another tactic to avoid engaging my rea=
sonable response to your arguments, which I find as base as those put forth=
 by religious people you dubbed yourself an expert on.

Now, I'll explain to you how my reply, as an argument, works.

1.=A0 I refuse to engage with religious folks, and anyone else, on the basi=
s of the "Nature vs. Nurture" level simply because to do so inevitably devo=
lves into a moral discussion typically reliant on the Holy Bible as the aut=
hority of choice.=A0 I don't base my argument on what the Holy Bible claims=
, but instead, keep the argument framed within the rights provided by the U=
.S. Constitution.=A0=20

Just because "that's how religious people think" doesn't mean I must conced=
e and allow them to use that bible as the foundation of this argument (reca=
ll separation of church and state).=A0 I can engage them without such conce=
ssions -- and do.=A0 In fact, the argument for civil rights, however based =
in morality vs. immortality for them, is truly not about whose moral barome=
ter is correct at all, as I imagine you know -- it is a matter of rights *f=
or everyone* despite and including our differences, even moral ones, as ack=
nowledged by separation of church and state.

2.=A0 My calling the "Nature vs. Nurture" debate a perversion should have t=
ipped you off, since the rest didn't.=A0 They like to call homosexuality a =
"perversion," but debating its existence as one of nature v. nurture to det=
ermine who gets what rights is itself a perversion.=A0=20
=A0=20
3.=A0 Further, you have included in your "argument" the very kind of thinki=
ng religious people resort to -- that of arguing the very existence of homo=
sexuality as "proven" by its existence in nature.=A0 Who cares?=A0 (That's =
a rhetorical one, Troy.=A0 I know who cares.)=A0 The point is that you argu=
e a biological basis for homosexuality as evidenced in the behavior of anim=
als.=A0 Religious folks will argue in return that we aren't animals and sho=
uldn't be gay just because they might be by some freak of nature.=A0 (Plus =
they like to take being gay a step further with this argument and ask if we=
'd like to marry goats next -- with a snort and a 'ha ha' to finalize the a=
bsurdity of the entire proposition).=A0=20

Why resort to such tactics?=A0 Just because they do?=A0 Just because that's=
 where they might find their moral footing?=A0 Nearly equating homosexualit=
y with animals (I know, you didn't) only denigrates any merit for seeking r=
ights as people who are different than them -- despite our differences, eve=
n in morality -- and certainly does not change their minds.=A0 It never has=
.=A0 Bringing the proof of animal behavior into the argument only distracts=
 and opens the door for tasteless jokes at the expense of any legitimacy fo=
r the claim to civil rights for each and every person in this country.=A0 (=
I say in the face of whether we should exist or not, we do and we will not =
go away, marriage rights or no.=A0 Whether we choose to be gay or are "born=
 that way", who I love is my *choice* and I certainly have the right to cho=
ose).

Finally, characterizing my reply as "screeching" and labeling it as the "li=
beral social agenda" -- even only by association -- as well as claiming I d=
idn't read your post in favor of "spouting off talking points" is a typical=
ly sexist admonishment and so much ad hominem name calling used to avoid en=
gaging the tenets of the argument I actually laid out in direct reply to yo=
ur post.=A0 In this elementary manner, you get to ride in on your noble ste=
ed and re-frame our discussion by writing me off as some sort of lil' unwor=
ldly & uninformed lady who needs the religious-minded explained to me so th=
at I can "know my enemy" via another nobleman you conjure, Sun Tzu.=A0=20

out."=A0 Instead, I'll suggest you engage with the actual basis of my argum=

 us on equal footing intellectually and go from there.=A0=20

In response to your last post regarding why folks who voted for Obama would=
 also vote for Prop 8, I would say that the African Americans and Hispanics=
 you cite were not solely responsible for its passage.=A0 Yes, I understand=
 on an exit poll that they voted for it 7 to 10, their turn-out was up perc=
entage points, etc.=A0 But this Prop 8 campaign was quite well-funded by th=
e Mormon church and was built and thrived on fear.=A0 McCain also attempted=
 to run his campaign on fear; his tactic lost where the Mormons scared a go=
od number of Californians into believing all sorts of ridiculous notions re=
liant on the idea that marriage itself would be threatened and worthless if=
 everyone were allowed that right.=A0 Regarding the communities you name:=
=A0 the LGBT community did not go into those neighborhoods and educate; the=
 Mormon fear campaign ran rampant, hence the exit polls.=A0=A0 It's a compl=
icated mix of who sold who on what fear; who spoke out for their rights and
 where, and who simply doesn't care if everyone has the same rights, partic=
ularly where their own aren't threatened.=A0=20

But to take on the religious tenets of the Mormon church (Joseph Smith's id=
eals, no less!) and debate them on their way of thinking, particularly in t=
erms of Nature vs. Nurture as you suggest, certainly will not advance the f=
ight for those rights nor will it render the fear mongering ineffective.=A0=
 To change the ways of thinking about this issue and frame the debate in le=
gal terms will go a lot further, and has historically done so.=A0 In other =
words:=A0 It's okay if you don't like my lifestyle, or if you don't like my=
 skin tone, or you think my religion is not as good as yours; it's your rig=
ht to think that way, but I'm a citizen of this country, pay my taxes, part=
icipate in the cogs of our economy, and am a citizen under the eyes of the =
law -- ergo, I deserve my rights the same as every other person in this cou=
ntry.=A0=20

Sometimes I wonder if anyone actually reads what anyone says and considers =
their
actual arguments or if they just act like politicians and spout off their
talking points regardless.

The question of whether or not "being gay" is natural or a choice is
not "beyond moot" to those againstgay marriage. To such people, their
belief that being gay is a choice has everything to do with it. They would =
argue
that choosing to be gay is like choosing to be a murderer, and insofar as b=

are immoral, both should be opposed. I, of course, to not consider this to =
be
the case. I too understand that sexuality is fluid and that, as a species, =
Homo
sapiens, like our close relatives the bonobos, are a bisexual species. Less
bisexual than bonobos, but more so than chimpanzees. The fact that hazy
sexuality is a biological fact in the human species is not moot, and is in =
fact
a benefit to those who want to argue for civil rightsrecognitions. If you w=

to make any headway on this issue, you have to understand the position of t=

opposition. "Know your enemy as you know yourself and you will not

your lack of understanding of how people think -- especially religious peop=

is what prevents you from understanding how Obama can win the Presidency, b=
ut
the African-Americans and Hispanics who voted for them voted against the li=

social agenda. I'm trying to explain it to you, and all you have to say is
that their reasons, which they consider to be central to their belief syste=

Subject: Civil Unions vs. Marriage -- "Separate But Equal" [Troy
& Mark]

Troy,

The question of being gay as "natural" or a "choice" is
beyond moot.  Since the constitution provides everyone equal rights - ahem =
- I
should be allowed to marry whomever I choose, so long as they consent and c=
hoose
me as well.  To devolve into such debate over whether the selection of one'=
s
spouse is a choice, a coercion, a divine intervention, a prophetic union, o=
r
what-have-you is to distract from the purposes & securities provided by the
constitution.  That we *must* be separated by gender was not something our
forefathers predicted would be problematic -- any more than when they wrote=
 that
some people weren't exactly human and could be owned as chattel. =20

But in an age when it is beginning to be acknowledged that gender lines are=
, at
best, blurred and complex, sexes are multiple (despite "corrective"
measures - http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/magazine/24intersexkids.html &
http://www.jenellerose.com/htmlpostings/intersex_babies_controversy.htm), a=
nd,
like it or not, gender is fluid, to create an amendment defining marriage a=
s
between a "man" and a "woman" is institutionalized bias.=20
Devolving into the archaic debate of just what penis and vagina should be
allowed a legally-sanctioned U.S. Gov't issued contract is silly and a
distracting fallacy.  Two people should be granted the same rights as any o=
ther
two people as written in the constitution.  This debate heralds back to the
not-so-old one of whether it was "right" that blacks and whites be
allowed the same rights under the law, as if the races were two different
species (see anti-miscegenation laws).  It wasn't so long ago that people
thought it
"unnatural" to see two separate skin tones loving one another.  Some
still think it "unnatural."   The debate of nature vs nurture is
itself a perversion. =20

An aside:  I think the passing of Prop 8 speaks moreover to the hope that b=
y
denying the GLBT community the right to marry will somehow abolish the very
existence of that community -- at least, that's my pessimistic read on the
whole debacle.   Gays/lesbians are the latest "Other" just as
immigrants remain "Alien" on the soil of a people obsessed with
"getting and keeping theirs." =20


Mark,=20

Separations of symbols vs. legalities not withstanding, civil unions and
domestic partnerships do NOT provide the same legal benefits that marriages=
 do.=20
It's all in the poetic wording, no?   "Separate but equal" has
historically betrayed everyone's "good" intentions.  If
"civil unions" were to be federally-mandated, then perhaps that would
cover the legal protections that marriages do, but until then:


What are some of the limitations of civil unions?

   =20

    Civil unions are different from marriage, and that difference has
    wide-ranging implications that make the two institutions unequal. Here
    is a quick look at some of the most significant differences:=20

   =20

    -Portability:

   =20

    Marriages are respected state to state for all purposes, but questions
    remain about how civil unions will be treated in other states.=20
    GLAD
    believes there are strong arguments that civil unions deserve respect
    across the country just like marriages. But the two appellate courts
    that have addressed the issue (in Connecticut and Georgia) have
    disrespected them based on the fact that their states do not grant civi=
l
unions themselves.

   =20

    -Ending a Civil Union:

   =20

    If you are married, you can get divorced in any state in which you are =
a
    resident. But if states continue to disrespect civil unions, there is
    no way to end the relationship other than by establishing residency in
    Vermont and filing for divorce there. This has already created problems
    for some couples who now have no way to terminate their legal
    commitment.

   =20

    -Federal Benefits:

   =20

    According to a 1997 GAO report, civil marriage brings with it at least
    1,049 legal protections and responsibilities from the federal
    government, including the right to take leave from work to care for a
    family member, the right to sponsor a spouse for immigration purposes,
    and Social Security survivor benefits that can make a difference betwee=
n
    old age in poverty and old age in security. Civil unions bring none of
    these critical legal protections.

   =20

    -Taxes & Public Benefits for the Family:

   =20

    Because the federal government does not respect civil unions, a couple
    with a civil union will be in a kind of limbo with regard to
    governmental functions performed by both state and federal governments,
    such as taxation, pension protections, provision of insurance for
    families, and means-tested programs like Medicaid. Even when states try
    to provide legal protections, they may be foreclosed from doing so in
    joint federal/state programs.

   =20

    -Filling out forms:

   =20

    Every day, we fill out forms that ask us whether we are married or
    single. People joined in a civil union don't fit into either category.
    People with civil unions should be able to identify themselves as a
    single family unit, but misrepresenting oneself on official documents
    can be considered fraud and carries potential serious criminal

    penalties.=20

   =20

    -Separate & Unequal -- Second-Class Status:

   =20

    Even if there were no substantive differences in the way the law treate=
d
    marriages and civil unions, the fact that a civil union remains a
    separate status just for gay people represents real and powerful
    inequality. We've been down this road before in this country and should
    not kid ourselves that a separate institution just for gay people is a
    just solution here either. Our constitution requires legal equality for
    all. Including gay and lesbian couples within existing marriage laws is
    the fairest and simplest thing to do.

   =20

    How real are these differences between marriage and civil unions, given
    that a federal law and some state laws discriminate against all
    marriages of same-sex couples?

   =20

    Would any of this change immediately with marriage of same-sex couples?
    Probably not, because married same-sex couples will face other layers o=
f
    discrimination against their marriages. Right now, a federal law denies
    recognition of same-sex unions conferred by any state for purposes of
    all federal programs and requirements and over 30 state laws do the
    same. Ending discrimination in marriage does not mean the end of all
    discrimination, but using the term "marriage" rather than
"civil union"
    is an essential first step to opening the door and addressing whether
    continued governmental discrimination against civil marriages of gay an=
d
    lesbian people makes sense.=20

   =20

    Marriage and civil unions remain different, both in practice and in

    principle.=20

   =20

    First, more than a dozen states have not taken a discriminatory positio=
n
    against civil marriages of gay and lesbian couples. In those states,
    civilly married gay and lesbian couples should be able to live and
    travel freely and without fear that their relationship will be
    disrespected.

   =20

    Second, even as to those states with discriminatory laws, legally
    married gay and lesbian couples from those states may well face some
    discrimination in some quarters, but their marriages will also be
    treated with legal respect in other arenas. Marriages are far more
    likely to be respected by others than newly minted "civil
unions."

   =20

    Using the term marriage also prompts a discussion about fairness.
    Allowing same sex couples to marry (rather than enter a separate status=
)
    will allow gay and lesbian people to talk with their neighbors, their
    local elected officials, and the Congress about whether discrimination
    against their marriages is fair. Where gay and lesbian people and their
    children are part of the social fabric, is it right to continue
    discriminating against them in civil marriage? The federal government
    and states that have taken discriminatory positions against marriages o=
f
    gay and lesbian couples could rethink those policies and go back to
    respecting state laws about marriage, as they have done for hundreds of
    years. In the end, we will not be able to have this discussion until
    gay and lesbian folks have what everyone else
    has: civil marriage.

Dear Murat

Thank you for your kind words re the poem.

It began with a few words taken from three places combined with all the rest
my own words

a few words, a fragment will be so riveting, it seizes one, is convulsive
and sings, has rhythms, so one has there as a starting point--and riffs off
of that--
and all one needs often enough are just two words, three words--

images created by the two or three words trigger involuntary associations
and linkings
and one is traveling-!

Paul Metcalf used to write me that my writing belonged to the "Dark French"
as he called it--and noted that at the same time in the darkness is always
what he saw being to him a Catholic light--always somewhere a cigarette tip
is glowing, or a candle, the flame of alighter beneath a spoon cooking
dope,  or a fire lit in a garbage can--or by a plastique explosion etc--

though i think Illumination whether sacred or profane is a very common theme
the world over--

the way you write of i also see-with liight breaking through into darkness,
through the most slender aperture in a thick wall--cracks and crevasses--

illumination is a light that can come both from within--and without--a
being, an object, a scene, an event--

it can have simply a physical meaning, or a spiritual, or one closer to the
sense it has in a painting--and in Illuminated Manuscripts"--

since very young i have had many very powerful experinces simply from
watching light move on a surface--or through dust motes--reflect
suddenly--and blaze--

some times these moments of a mystical illumination are so unexpected and so
swift--they are travel of indeed light speeds--intuition's lightning quantum
leaps--

and once in a while they have such a fitting grandeur that one --is
overwhelmed--
though it is almost one feels a sterotype yet still so beautiful and
powerful it does indeed at that moment powerfully change one's life

illumination also lights the writings everywhere existing, alive--that do
not need alphabets nor books for support--
nor want to be cooped up in their prisons--
mobile, guerilla, nomadic, fugitive-
"light on her/his feet"!

It gets more complicated, since marriage / common property laws vary state
by state according to the basis of the law -- they aren't a federal matter
(like equal rights isn't a federal matter since there's no amendment -- it
varies state by state.

For example, California is a common property state (based on the Napoleonic
Code), so there are no common-law unions.

So the marriage issue here is more about insurance, custody, inheritance,
joint tenancy with right of survivorship, and visitation rights.

The second -- and someone correct me, I don't think this applies to same sex
relationships, but I could be wrong -- a man and woman live together,
everything is officially jointly owned, BUT the extra goodies that happen
with common law (in New York, Hawaii, etc.) don't inhere -- ever.

For example, we wouldn't have had to get married if we were in New York; we
would already have been usefully-enough married.

I will only quickly note that this is the kind of argument I was merely asking for, and that it is quite different in tone from the other posting -- though I will criticize you on the fact that if mine was condescending, this was off the barometer. Let's both make an effort to keep it civilized. Further, it's you who chose to interpret my comment about screeching, etc. in a sexist fashion. Another all-too-typical liberal tactic: to shut down arguments with accusations of racism, sexism, etc. rather than engaging the issues. My experience is that too many liberals are screechers, regardless of sex. If you choose to take offense at my remarks, remember that it is you who are choosing to take offense -- there is nothing inherently offensive in what I wrote. Finally, a good idea is a good idea, no matter where it comes from. I think almost every thought of Marx's is pure evil -- but when he has a good idea, he has a good idea. Don't disregard Sun Tzu just
 because he was an aristocrat -- he was an aristocrat who won wars (if I were a liberal, I would accuse you of disregarding him because he was Chinese, something I'm certain is absurd).

That having been said, I do take several of your points. The civil rights arguments are an excellent approach. Having been raised a Baptist in Kentucky, and being now married to an Hispanic, I think I have some expertise in the areas of which I speak. My experience is that religious people rather claim that homosexuality is "unnatural." This is quickly undermined by the aforementioned examples, which puts them in a tight rhetorical spot, as they now have to regroup and argue that "well, we're not animals. We're supposed to be better." I typically then direct them to their previous argument. If they claim it's a mater of choice, I can and have proven otherwise. Having demonstrated the incoherence of their argument, they have typically then been more receptive to other arguments regarding civil rights, etc. The real issue for many religious people, I think, is less that the government "recognize" gay marriage than that they have a fear that the government
 will turn around and force their church to perform gay marriage ceremonies. There have been several cases of churches being forced by law to hire someone whose lifestyle they did not approve of, so their fears are not entirely unfounded. It seems to me, then, that if we are going to win this argument, we have to figure out a way to assuage those concerns. And if we are truly believers in a separation of church and state, we cannot use the state to force the churches to accept our world view. That should, in fact, require persuasion rather than laws. One could also point out to fundamentalists that there is much prohibited by the Bible we do not bother with, so why are we picking and choosing? I recommend Peter McWilliams' "Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do" for some excellent arguments along those lines.

Subject: Re: Civil Unions vs. Marriage -- "Separate But Equal" [Troy & Mark]

Troy,

I know this will be difficult to admit, but your reply, and often times your style of arguing here, is hypocritical in its condescension.

Having grown up on the Bible Belt in Stone Mountain, GA, I used to be one of those "religious people" and, as such, continue to communicate with them.  My response to you *is* my response to those religious people you've determined I don't understand.

However, I don't need you to explain to me "how people think" and how to respond, verbatim, to "African Americans and Hispanics" -- for you to be so elementary and condescending is just another tactic to avoid engaging my reasonable response to your arguments, which I find as base as those put forth by religious people you dubbed yourself an expert on.

Now, I'll explain to you how my reply, as an argument, works.

1.  I refuse to engage with religious folks, and anyone else, on the basis of the "Nature vs. Nurture" level simply because to do so inevitably devolves into a moral discussion typically reliant on the Holy Bible as the authority of choice.  I don't base my argument on what the Holy Bible claims, but instead, keep the argument framed within the rights provided by the U.S. Constitution.

Just because "that's how religious people think" doesn't mean I must concede and allow them to use that bible as the foundation of this argument (recall separation of church and state).  I can engage them without such concessions -- and do.  In fact, the argument for civil rights, however based in morality vs. immortality for them, is truly not about whose moral barometer is correct at all, as I imagine you know -- it is a matter of rights *for everyone* despite and including our differences, even moral ones, as acknowledged by separation of church and state.

2.  My calling the "Nature vs. Nurture" debate a perversion should have tipped you off, since the rest didn't.  They like to call homosexuality a "perversion," but debating its existence as one of nature v. nurture to determine who gets what rights is itself a perversion.

3.  Further, you have included in your "argument" the very kind of thinking religious people resort to -- that of arguing the very existence of homosexuality as "proven" by its existence in nature.  Who cares?  (That's a rhetorical one, Troy.  I know who cares.)  The point is that you argue a biological basis for homosexuality as evidenced in the behavior of animals.  Religious folks will argue in return that we aren't animals and shouldn't be gay just because they might be by some freak of nature.  (Plus they like to take being gay a step further with this argument and ask if we'd like to marry goats next -- with a snort and a 'ha ha' to finalize the absurdity of the entire proposition).

Why resort to such tactics?  Just because they do?  Just because that's where they might find their moral footing?  Nearly equating homosexuality with animals (I know, you didn't) only denigrates any merit for seeking rights as people who are different than them -- despite our differences, even in morality -- and certainly does not change their minds.  It never has.  Bringing the proof of animal behavior into the argument only distracts and opens the door for tasteless jokes at the expense of any legitimacy for the claim to civil rights for each and every person in this country.  (I say in the face of whether we should exist or not, we do and we will not go away, marriage rights or no.  Whether we choose to be gay or are "born that way", who I love is my *choice* and I certainly have the right to choose).

Finally, characterizing my reply as "screeching" and labeling it as the "liberal social agenda" -- even only by association -- as well as claiming I didn't read your post in favor of "spouting off talking points" is a typically sexist admonishment and so much ad hominem name calling used to avoid engaging the tenets of the argument I actually laid out in direct reply to your post.  In this elementary manner, you get to ride in on your noble steed and re-frame our discussion by writing me off as some sort of lil' unworldly & uninformed lady who needs the religious-minded explained to me so that I can "know my enemy" via another nobleman you conjure, Sun Tzu.

I'm sorry; I won't bat my eyes and be impressed that you "found my naivete out."  Instead, I'll suggest you engage with the actual basis of my argument and ask you to please stop being unnecessarily instructive.  Consider us on equal footing intellectually and go from there.

In response to your last post regarding why folks who voted for Obama would also vote for Prop 8, I would say that the African Americans and Hispanics you cite were not solely responsible for its passage.  Yes, I understand on an exit poll that they voted for it 7 to 10, their turn-out was up percentage points, etc.  But this Prop 8 campaign was quite well-funded by the Mormon church and was built and thrived on fear.  McCain also attempted to run his campaign on fear; his tactic lost where the Mormons scared a good number of Californians into believing all sorts of ridiculous notions reliant on the idea that marriage itself would be threatened and worthless if everyone were allowed that right.  Regarding the communities you name:  the LGBT community did not go into those neighborhoods and educate; the Mormon fear campaign ran rampant, hence the exit polls.   It's a complicated mix of who sold who on what fear; who spoke out for their rights and
where, and who simply doesn't care if everyone has the same rights, particularly where their own aren't threatened.

But to take on the religious tenets of the Mormon church (Joseph Smith's ideals, no less!) and debate them on their way of thinking, particularly in terms of Nature vs. Nurture as you suggest, certainly will not advance the fight for those rights nor will it render the fear mongering ineffective.  To change the ways of thinking about this issue and frame the debate in legal terms will go a lot further, and has historically done so.  In other words:  It's okay if you don't like my lifestyle, or if you don't like my skin tone, or you think my religion is not as good as yours; it's your right to think that way, but I'm a citizen of this country, pay my taxes, participate in the cogs of our economy, and am a citizen under the eyes of the law -- ergo, I deserve my rights the same as every other person in this country.

Be well,

Amy

Sometimes I wonder if anyone actually reads what anyone says and considers their
actual arguments or if they just act like politicians and spout off their
talking points regardless.

The question of whether or not "being gay" is natural or a choice is
not "beyond moot" to those againstgay marriage. To such people, their
belief that being gay is a choice has everything to do with it. They would argue
that choosing to be gay is like choosing to be a murderer, and insofar as both
are immoral, both should be opposed. I, of course, to not consider this to be
the case. I too understand that sexuality is fluid and that, as a species, Homo
sapiens, like our close relatives the bonobos, are a bisexual species. Less
bisexual than bonobos, but more so than chimpanzees. The fact that hazy
sexuality is a biological fact in the human species is not moot, and is in fact
a benefit to those who want to argue for civil rightsrecognitions. If you want
to make any headway on this issue, you have to understand the position of the
opposition. "Know your enemy as you know yourself and you will not
fail." -- Sun Tzu. The reason so many liberals can't get
anything done is that you think screeching at the top of your lungs is what
gets things done, and you don't even bother to try to argue your point. And
your lack of understanding of how people think -- especially religious people --
is what prevents you from understanding how Obama can win the Presidency, but
the African-Americans and Hispanics who voted for them voted against the liberal
social agenda. I'm trying to explain it to you, and all you have to say is
that their reasons, which they consider to be central to their belief system, is
merely a "moot point." It's condescending to them, and won't
win any arguments with them.

Subject: Civil Unions vs. Marriage -- "Separate But Equal" [Troy
& Mark]

Troy,

The question of being gay as "natural" or a "choice" is
beyond moot.  Since the constitution provides everyone equal rights - ahem - I
should be allowed to marry whomever I choose, so long as they consent and choose
me as well.  To devolve into such debate over whether the selection of one's
spouse is a choice, a coercion, a divine intervention, a prophetic union, or
what-have-you is to distract from the purposes & securities provided by the
constitution.  That we *must* be separated by gender was not something our
forefathers predicted would be problematic -- any more than when they wrote that
some people weren't exactly human and could be owned as chattel.

But in an age when it is beginning to be acknowledged that gender lines are, at
best, blurred and complex, sexes are multiple (despite "corrective"
measures - http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/magazine/24intersexkids.html &
http://www.jenellerose.com/htmlpostings/intersex_babies_controversy.htm), and,
like it or not, gender is fluid, to create an amendment defining marriage as
between a "man" and a "woman" is institutionalized bias.
Devolving into the archaic debate of just what penis and vagina should be
allowed a legally-sanctioned U.S. Gov't issued contract is silly and a
distracting fallacy.  Two people should be granted the same rights as any other
two people as written in the constitution.  This debate heralds back to the
not-so-old one of whether it was "right" that blacks and whites be
allowed the same rights under the law, as if the races were two different
species (see anti-miscegenation laws).  It wasn't so long ago that people
thought it
"unnatural" to see two separate skin tones loving one another.  Some
still think it "unnatural."   The debate of nature vs nurture is
itself a perversion.

An aside:  I think the passing of Prop 8 speaks moreover to the hope that by
denying the GLBT community the right to marry will somehow abolish the very
existence of that community -- at least, that's my pessimistic read on the
whole debacle.   Gays/lesbians are the latest "Other" just as
immigrants remain "Alien" on the soil of a people obsessed with
"getting and keeping theirs."


Mark,

Separations of symbols vs. legalities not withstanding, civil unions and
domestic partnerships do NOT provide the same legal benefits that marriages do.
It's all in the poetic wording, no?   "Separate but equal" has
historically betrayed everyone's "good" intentions.  If
"civil unions" were to be federally-mandated, then perhaps that would
cover the legal protections that marriages do, but until then:


What are some of the limitations of civil unions?



    Civil unions are different from marriage, and that difference has
    wide-ranging implications that make the two institutions unequal. Here
    is a quick look at some of the most significant differences:



    -Portability:



    Marriages are respected state to state for all purposes, but questions
    remain about how civil unions will be treated in other states.
    GLAD
    believes there are strong arguments that civil unions deserve respect
    across the country just like marriages. But the two appellate courts
    that have addressed the issue (in Connecticut and Georgia) have
    disrespected them based on the fact that their states do not grant civil
unions themselves.



    -Ending a Civil Union:



    If you are married, you can get divorced in any state in which you are a
    resident. But if states continue to disrespect civil unions, there is
    no way to end the relationship other than by establishing residency in
    Vermont and filing for divorce there. This has already created problems
    for some couples who now have no way to terminate their legal
    commitment.



    -Federal Benefits:



    According to a 1997 GAO report, civil marriage brings with it at least
    1,049 legal protections and responsibilities from the federal
    government, including the right to take leave from work to care for a
    family member, the right to sponsor a spouse for immigration purposes,
    and Social Security survivor benefits that can make a difference between
    old age in poverty and old age in security. Civil unions bring none of
    these critical legal protections.



    -Taxes & Public Benefits for the Family:



    Because the federal government does not respect civil unions, a couple
    with a civil union will be in a kind of limbo with regard to
    governmental functions performed by both state and federal governments,
    such as taxation, pension protections, provision of insurance for
    families, and means-tested programs like Medicaid. Even when states try
    to provide legal protections, they may be foreclosed from doing so in
    joint federal/state programs.



    -Filling out forms:



    Every day, we fill out forms that ask us whether we are married or
    single. People joined in a civil union don't fit into either category.
    People with civil unions should be able to identify themselves as a
    single family unit, but misrepresenting oneself on official documents
    can be considered fraud and carries potential serious criminal

    penalties.



    -Separate & Unequal -- Second-Class Status:



    Even if there were no substantive differences in the way the law treated
    marriages and civil unions, the fact that a civil union remains a
    separate status just for gay people represents real and powerful
    inequality. We've been down this road before in this country and should
    not kid ourselves that a separate institution just for gay people is a
    just solution here either. Our constitution requires legal equality for
    all. Including gay and lesbian couples within existing marriage laws is
    the fairest and simplest thing to do.



    How real are these differences between marriage and civil unions, given
    that a federal law and some state laws discriminate against all
    marriages of same-sex couples?



    Would any of this change immediately with marriage of same-sex couples?
    Probably not, because married same-sex couples will face other layers of
    discrimination against their marriages. Right now, a federal law denies
    recognition of same-sex unions conferred by any state for purposes of
    all federal programs and requirements and over 30 state laws do the
    same. Ending discrimination in marriage does not mean the end of all
    discrimination, but using the term "marriage" rather than
"civil union"
    is an essential first step to opening the door and addressing whether
    continued governmental discrimination against civil marriages of gay and
    lesbian people makes sense.



    Marriage and civil unions remain different, both in practice and in

    principle.



    First, more than a dozen states have not taken a discriminatory position
    against civil marriages of gay and lesbian couples. In those states,
    civilly married gay and lesbian couples should be able to live and
    travel freely and without fear that their relationship will be
    disrespected.



    Second, even as to those states with discriminatory laws, legally
    married gay and lesbian couples from those states may well face some
    discrimination in some quarters, but their marriages will also be
    treated with legal respect in other arenas. Marriages are far more
    likely to be respected by others than newly minted "civil
unions."



    Using the term marriage also prompts a discussion about fairness.
    Allowing same sex couples to marry (rather than enter a separate status)
    will allow gay and lesbian people to talk with their neighbors, their
    local elected officials, and the Congress about whether discrimination
    against their marriages is fair. Where gay and lesbian people and their
    children are part of the social fabric, is it right to continue
    discriminating against them in civil marriage? The federal government
    and states that have taken discriminatory positions against marriages of
    gay and lesbian couples could rethink those policies and go back to
    respecting state laws about marriage, as they have done for hundreds of
    years. In the end, we will not be able to have this discussion until
    gay and lesbian folks have what everyone else
    has: civil marriage.

If Obama is not African American in the traditional sense, neither is
Walcott.
But read Walcott's long poem about spending time in Little Rock,
Arkansas, and
read Obama's memoir about growing up in Hawai`i and then moving to South
Side, Chicago.  It's not just where they come from, it's how others
treated them that
matters.  Both men know their (various) genealogies and can deploy them
ably.
Obama's victory speech subsumed King's rhetoric into a larger field.
Yes, he's
an American politician; no he's not going change America utterly.  But what
a sea-change it still is!  And how wonderful to see the Bush years
repudiated, finally.

Troy,

Continuing to label my responses as so many "liberal tactics" carries on yo=
ur condescension, and indeed, your characterization of my original reply as=
 "screeching" most certainly is sexist, whether I "choose" to read it that =
way or not.=A0 You're trying to shuck the weight of your words by making th=
e weight they carry my burden to accept or deny them -- but you are the one=
 flinging such nasty characterizations, and you have felt it historically n=
ecessary on this list to do so with many people (i.e.=A0 "liberal tactics" =
is but one seeming insult in your Poetics List arsenal).=A0 Why the urge to=
 label and characterize responses on this list at all?

Why not take your own advice and just "engage the issues", as you continue =
to claim that I did not do.=A0 In fact, I have done nothing but respond to =
your claims (re-read the whole thread below), as well as point out the ad h=
ominem strains in your response.=A0 It is this latter aspect of my reply th=
at hurts your pride and raises the defensive hairs on your back.=A0 But you=
r style of arguing is full of unnecessary bait & attack that reminds me of =
Rush Limbaugh's "responses" to feminist claims -- if you call her an angry =
cow, you no longer have to listen to what she says; you need only paint a p=
icture of her and ask that she be tamed, or try to tame her yourself.=A0=A0=
 "Screeching" runs along those same lines, like it or not ...=20


Regarding the meat of your argument, I'd like to know when the U.S. Governm=
ent forced any church to hire people whose lifestyles they didn't approve o=
f?=A0 I really don't know about any instances of such legal intervention wi=
th any church regarding the hiring of gay clergy and am quite curious.=A0 W=

Additionally, I'd like to point out, though I use the term too, that even "=
gay marriages" seems misguided.=A0 Marriages are marriages are marriages.=
=A0 We don't say, "The government should perform bi-racial marriages."=A0 I=
nstead, we demand that everyone have the right to marry.=A0 I suppose it wo=
uld be difficult to keep saying, 'Give the right to marry to the GLBT commu=

start to eliminating the marginialized thinking this issue sustains.=A0=20

I will only quickly note that this is the kind of argument I was merely ask=
ing
for, and that it is quite different in tone from the other posting -- thoug=
h I
will criticize you on the fact that if mine was condescending, this was off=
 the
barometer. Let's both make an effort to keep it civilized. Further, it's
you who chose to interpret my comment about screeching, etc. in a sexist
fashion. Another all-too-typical liberal tactic: to shut down arguments wit=
h
accusations of racism, sexism, etc. rather than engaging the issues. My
experience is that too many liberals are screechers, regardless of sex. If =
you
choose to take offense at my remarks, remember that it is you who are choos=
ing
to take offense -- there is nothing inherently offensive in what I wrote.
Finally, a good idea is a good idea, no matter where it comes from. I think
almost every thought of Marx's is pure evil -- but when he has a good idea,
he has a good idea. Don't disregard Sun Tzu just
 because he was an aristocrat -- he was an aristocrat who won wars (if I we=
re a
liberal, I would accuse you of disregarding him because he was Chinese,
something I'm certain is absurd).=20

That having been said, I do take several of your points. The civil rights
arguments are an excellent approach. Having been raised a Baptist in Kentuc=
ky,
and being now married to an Hispanic, I think I have some expertise in the =
areas
of which I speak. My experience is that religious people rather claim that
homosexuality is "unnatural." This is quickly undermined by the
aforementioned examples, which puts them in a tight rhetorical spot, as the=
y now
have to regroup and argue that "well, we're not animals. We're
supposed to be better." I typically then direct them to their previous
argument. If they claim it's a mater of choice, I can and have proven
otherwise. Having demonstrated the incoherence of their argument, they have
typically then been more receptive to other arguments regarding civil right=
s,
etc. The real issue for many religious people, I think, is less that the
government "recognize" gay marriage than that they have a fear that
the government
 will turn around and force their church to perform gay marriage ceremonies=
.
There have been several cases of churches being forced by law to hire someo=
ne
whose lifestyle they did not approve of, so their fears are not entirely
unfounded. It seems to me, then, that if we are going to win this argument,=
 we
have to figure out a way to assuage those concerns. And if we are truly
believers in a separation of church and state, we cannot use the state to f=
orce
the churches to accept our world view. That should, in fact, require persua=
sion
rather than laws. One could also point out to fundamentalists that there is=
 much
prohibited by the Bible we do not bother with, so why are we picking and
choosing? I recommend Peter McWilliams' "Ain't Nobody's
Business If You Do" for some excellent arguments along those lines.=20

Subject: Re: Civil Unions vs. Marriage -- "Separate But Equal" [Troy
& Mark]

Troy,

I know this will be difficult to admit, but your reply, and often times you=
r
style of arguing here, is hypocritical in its condescension. =20

Having grown up on the Bible Belt in Stone Mountain, GA, I used to be one o=
f
those "religious people" and, as such, continue to communicate with
them.  My response to you *is* my response to those religious people you've
determined I don't understand.

However, I don't need you to explain to me "how people think" and
how to respond, verbatim, to "African Americans and Hispanics" -- for
you to be so elementary and condescending is just another tactic to avoid
engaging my reasonable response to your arguments, which I find as base as =
those
put forth by religious people you dubbed yourself an expert on.

Now, I'll explain to you how my reply, as an argument, works.

1.  I refuse to engage with religious folks, and anyone else, on the basis =
of
the "Nature vs. Nurture" level simply because to do so inevitably
devolves into a moral discussion typically reliant on the Holy Bible as the
authority of choice.  I don't base my argument on what the Holy Bible
claims, but instead, keep the argument framed within the rights provided by=
 the
U.S. Constitution. =20

Just because "that's how religious people think" doesn't mean
I must concede and allow them to use that bible as the foundation of this
argument (recall separation of church and state).  I can engage them withou=
t
such concessions -- and do.  In fact, the argument for civil rights, howeve=
r
based in morality vs. immortality for them, is truly not about whose moral
barometer is correct at all, as I imagine you know -- it is a matter of rig=
hts
*for everyone* despite and including our differences, even moral ones, as
acknowledged by separation of church and state.

2.  My calling the "Nature vs. Nurture" debate a perversion should
have tipped you off, since the rest didn't.  They like to call homosexualit=
y
a "perversion," but debating its existence as one of nature v. nurture
to determine who gets what rights is itself a perversion. =20
 =20
3.  Further, you have included in your "argument" the very kind of
thinking religious people resort to -- that of arguing the very existence o=
f
homosexuality as "proven" by its existence in nature.  Who cares?=20
(That's a rhetorical one, Troy.  I know who cares.)  The point is that you
argue a biological basis for homosexuality as evidenced in the behavior of
animals.  Religious folks will argue in return that we aren't animals and
shouldn't be gay just because they might be by some freak of nature.  (Plus
they like to take being gay a step further with this argument and ask if
we'd like to marry goats next -- with a snort and a 'ha ha' to
finalize the absurdity of the entire proposition). =20

Why resort to such tactics?  Just because they do?  Just because that's
where they might find their moral footing?  Nearly equating homosexuality w=
ith
animals (I know, you didn't) only denigrates any merit for seeking rights a=
s
people who are different than them -- despite our differences, even in mora=
lity
-- and certainly does not change their minds.  It never has.  Bringing the =
proof
of animal behavior into the argument only distracts and opens the door for
tasteless jokes at the expense of any legitimacy for the claim to civil rig=
hts
for each and every person in this country.  (I say in the face of whether w=
e
should exist or not, we do and we will not go away, marriage rights or no.=
=20
Whether we choose to be gay or are "born that way", who I love is my
*choice* and I certainly have the right to choose).

Finally, characterizing my reply as "screeching" and labeling it as
the "liberal social agenda" -- even only by association -- as well as
claiming I didn't read your post in favor of "spouting off talking
points" is a typically sexist admonishment and so much ad hominem name
calling used to avoid engaging the tenets of the argument I actually laid o=
ut in
direct reply to your post.  In this elementary manner, you get to ride in o=
n
your noble steed and re-frame our discussion by writing me off as some sort=
 of
lil' unworldly & uninformed lady who needs the religious-minded
explained to me so that I can "know my enemy" via another nobleman you
conjure, Sun Tzu. =20

I'm sorry; I won't bat my eyes and be impressed that you "found my
naivete out."  Instead, I'll suggest you engage with the actual basis
of my argument and ask you to please stop being unnecessarily instructive.=
=20
Consider us on equal footing intellectually and go from there. =20

In response to your last post regarding why folks who voted for Obama would
also vote for Prop 8, I would say that the African Americans and Hispanics =
you
cite were not solely responsible for its passage.  Yes, I understand on an =
exit
poll that they voted for it 7 to 10, their turn-out was up percentage point=
s,
etc.  But this Prop 8 campaign was quite well-funded by the Mormon church a=
nd
was built and thrived on fear.  McCain also attempted to run his campaign o=
n
fear; his tactic lost where the Mormons scared a good number of Californian=
s
into believing all sorts of ridiculous notions reliant on the idea that mar=
riage
itself would be threatened and worthless if everyone were allowed that righ=
t.=20
Regarding the communities you name:  the LGBT community did not go into tho=
se
neighborhoods and educate; the Mormon fear campaign ran rampant, hence the =
exit
polls.   It's a complicated mix of who sold who on what fear; who spoke out
for their rights and
where, and who simply doesn't care if everyone has the same rights,
particularly where their own aren't threatened. =20

But to take on the religious tenets of the Mormon church (Joseph Smith's
ideals, no less!) and debate them on their way of thinking, particularly in
terms of Nature vs. Nurture as you suggest, certainly will not advance the =
fight
for those rights nor will it render the fear mongering ineffective.  To cha=
nge
the ways of thinking about this issue and frame the debate in legal terms w=
ill
go a lot further, and has historically done so.  In other words:  It's okay
if you don't like my lifestyle, or if you don't like my skin tone, or
you think my religion is not as good as yours; it's your right to think tha=
t
way, but I'm a citizen of this country, pay my taxes, participate in the
cogs of our economy, and am a citizen under the eyes of the law -- ergo, I
deserve my rights the same as every other person in this country. =20

Be well,

Amy

Sometimes I wonder if anyone actually reads what anyone says and considers
their
actual arguments or if they just act like politicians and spout off their
talking points regardless.

The question of whether or not "being gay" is natural or a choice is
not "beyond moot" to those againstgay marriage. To such people, their
belief that being gay is a choice has everything to do with it. They would
argue
that choosing to be gay is like choosing to be a murderer, and insofar as b=
oth
are immoral, both should be opposed. I, of course, to not consider this to =
be
the case. I too understand that sexuality is fluid and that, as a species, =
Homo
sapiens, like our close relatives the bonobos, are a bisexual species. Less
bisexual than bonobos, but more so than chimpanzees. The fact that hazy
sexuality is a biological fact in the human species is not moot, and is in =
fact
a benefit to those who want to argue for civil rightsrecognitions. If you w=

to make any headway on this issue, you have to understand the position of t=

opposition. "Know your enemy as you know yourself and you will not

your lack of understanding of how people think -- especially religious peop=

is what prevents you from understanding how Obama can win the Presidency, b=

the African-Americans and Hispanics who voted for them voted against the
liberal
social agenda. I'm trying to explain it to you, and all you have to say is
that their reasons, which they consider to be central to their belief syste=

merely a "moot point." It's condescending to them, and won't

Subject: Civil Unions vs. Marriage -- "Separate But Equal" [Troy
& Mark]

Troy,

The question of being gay as "natural" or a "choice" is
beyond moot.  Since the constitution provides everyone equal rights - ahem =
- I
should be allowed to marry whomever I choose, so long as they consent and
choose
me as well.  To devolve into such debate over whether the selection of
one's
spouse is a choice, a coercion, a divine intervention, a prophetic union, o=
r
what-have-you is to distract from the purposes & securities provided by the
constitution.  That we *must* be separated by gender was not something our
forefathers predicted would be problematic -- any more than when they wrote
that
some people weren't exactly human and could be owned as chattel. =20

But in an age when it is beginning to be acknowledged that gender lines are=
, at
best, blurred and complex, sexes are multiple (despite "corrective"
measures - http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/magazine/24intersexkids.html &
http://www.jenellerose.com/htmlpostings/intersex_babies_controversy.htm), a=
nd,
like it or not, gender is fluid, to create an amendment defining marriage a=
s
between a "man" and a "woman" is institutionalized bias.=20
Devolving into the archaic debate of just what penis and vagina should be
allowed a legally-sanctioned U.S. Gov't issued contract is silly and a
distracting fallacy.  Two people should be granted the same rights as any o=
ther
two people as written in the constitution.  This debate heralds back to the
not-so-old one of whether it was "right" that blacks and whites be
allowed the same rights under the law, as if the races were two different
species (see anti-miscegenation laws).  It wasn't so long ago that people
thought it
"unnatural" to see two separate skin tones loving one another.  Some
still think it "unnatural."   The debate of nature vs nurture is
itself a perversion. =20

An aside:  I think the passing of Prop 8 speaks moreover to the hope that b=
y
denying the GLBT community the right to marry will somehow abolish the very
existence of that community -- at least, that's my pessimistic read on the
whole debacle.   Gays/lesbians are the latest "Other" just as
immigrants remain "Alien" on the soil of a people obsessed with
"getting and keeping theirs." =20


Mark,=20

Separations of symbols vs. legalities not withstanding, civil unions and
domestic partnerships do NOT provide the same legal benefits that marriages=
 do.

It's all in the poetic wording, no?   "Separate but equal" has
historically betrayed everyone's "good" intentions.  If
"civil unions" were to be federally-mandated, then perhaps that would
cover the legal protections that marriages do, but until then:


What are some of the limitations of civil unions?

   =20

    Civil unions are different from marriage, and that difference has
    wide-ranging implications that make the two institutions unequal. Here
    is a quick look at some of the most significant differences:=20

   =20

    -Portability:

   =20

    Marriages are respected state to state for all purposes, but questions
    remain about how civil unions will be treated in other states.=20
    GLAD
    believes there are strong arguments that civil unions deserve respect
    across the country just like marriages. But the two appellate courts
    that have addressed the issue (in Connecticut and Georgia) have
    disrespected them based on the fact that their states do not grant civi=
l
unions themselves.

   =20

    -Ending a Civil Union:

   =20

    If you are married, you can get divorced in any state in which you are =
a
    resident. But if states continue to disrespect civil unions, there is
    no way to end the relationship other than by establishing residency in
    Vermont and filing for divorce there. This has already created problems
    for some couples who now have no way to terminate their legal
    commitment.

   =20

    -Federal Benefits:

   =20

    According to a 1997 GAO report, civil marriage brings with it at least
    1,049 legal protections and responsibilities from the federal
    government, including the right to take leave from work to care for a
    family member, the right to sponsor a spouse for immigration purposes,
    and Social Security survivor benefits that can make a difference betwee=
n
    old age in poverty and old age in security. Civil unions bring none of
    these critical legal protections.

   =20

    -Taxes & Public Benefits for the Family:

   =20

    Because the federal government does not respect civil unions, a couple
    with a civil union will be in a kind of limbo with regard to
    governmental functions performed by both state and federal governments,
    such as taxation, pension protections, provision of insurance for
    families, and means-tested programs like Medicaid. Even when states try
    to provide legal protections, they may be foreclosed from doing so in
    joint federal/state programs.

   =20

    -Filling out forms:

   =20

    Every day, we fill out forms that ask us whether we are married or
    single. People joined in a civil union don't fit into either category.
    People with civil unions should be able to identify themselves as a
    single family unit, but misrepresenting oneself on official documents
    can be considered fraud and carries potential serious criminal

    penalties.=20

   =20

    -Separate & Unequal -- Second-Class Status:

   =20

    Even if there were no substantive differences in the way the law treate=
d
    marriages and civil unions, the fact that a civil union remains a
    separate status just for gay people represents real and powerful
    inequality. We've been down this road before in this country and should
    not kid ourselves that a separate institution just for gay people is a
    just solution here either. Our constitution requires legal equality for
    all. Including gay and lesbian couples within existing marriage laws is
    the fairest and simplest thing to do.

   =20

    How real are these differences between marriage and civil unions, given
    that a federal law and some state laws discriminate against all
    marriages of same-sex couples?

   =20

    Would any of this change immediately with marriage of same-sex couples?
    Probably not, because married same-sex couples will face other layers o=
f
    discrimination against their marriages. Right now, a federal law denies
    recognition of same-sex unions conferred by any state for purposes of
    all federal programs and requirements and over 30 state laws do the
    same. Ending discrimination in marriage does not mean the end of all
    discrimination, but using the term "marriage" rather than
"civil union"
    is an essential first step to opening the door and addressing whether
    continued governmental discrimination against civil marriages of gay an=
d
    lesbian people makes sense.=20

   =20

    Marriage and civil unions remain different, both in practice and in

    principle.=20

   =20

    First, more than a dozen states have not taken a discriminatory positio=
n
    against civil marriages of gay and lesbian couples. In those states,
    civilly married gay and lesbian couples should be able to live and
    travel freely and without fear that their relationship will be
    disrespected.

   =20

    Second, even as to those states with discriminatory laws, legally
    married gay and lesbian couples from those states may well face some
    discrimination in some quarters, but their marriages will also be
    treated with legal respect in other arenas. Marriages are far more
    likely to be respected by others than newly minted "civil
unions."

   =20

    Using the term marriage also prompts a discussion about fairness.
    Allowing same sex couples to marry (rather than enter a separate status=
)
    will allow gay and lesbian people to talk with their neighbors, their
    local elected officials, and the Congress about whether discrimination
    against their marriages is fair. Where gay and lesbian people and their
    children are part of the social fabric, is it right to continue
    discriminating against them in civil marriage? The federal government
    and states that have taken discriminatory positions against marriages o=
f
    gay and lesbian couples could rethink those policies and go back to
    respecting state laws about marriage, as they have done for hundreds of
    years. In the end, we will not be able to have this discussion until
    gay and lesbian folks have what everyone else
    has: civil marriage.

Right, it's a state by state issue, though if you marry in California
and live in Iowa it's Iowa law that applies, and it's in Iowa that
you file for divorce if that's how it crumbles. This is profoundly
stupid, like local control of education, hospital accreditation, etc.
In my utopian fantasy states would voluntarily relinqiuish control in
these areas to the feds, who would establish uniform, sensible rules.
Yeah, right.

New York has no common law marriage status and very few rights for
unmarried partners, except for what's assigned in specific contracts.
Within marriage common property is the rule, including property owned
before the marriage by one partner or the other, unless excluded by
specific contracts (think prenups). A friend of mine going through a
divorce at the moment is faced with selling the house she's owned
since way before the marriage in order to give her soon-to-be ex half
the proceeds.

In California, where I got divorced a few years ago, common property
is only what gets accrued during the marriage. My friend would be
able to keep her house.

I don't know the details of civil union laws.

Thank you, Susan, for stating the obvious.
Further, Obama is literally African American.  No hyphen, in terms of =20=

immediate genealogy.
Derek Walcott is absolutely of the Americas, and the African diaspora, =20=

just as my Barbadian family is.  Pause and consider all the West =20
Indian folks folded up into the "African-American" category in this =20
country.
The rigidity of the discussion of lineage, heritage, genealogy, here, =20=

prior to your message, Susan, is surprisingly limited, essentialist, =20
and despairing, recalling all the nonsense about whether Obama is =20
"black enough."
What stuns me (though it shouldn't) is the insistence on defining =20
African-American identity in such rigid terms while maintaining =20
whiteness as an absolutely nebulous necessity that's separate from =20
everything and everyone else, hovering above and shadowing genealogy, =20=

culpability, and history, particularly the history of the process that =20=

made Africans American in the first place.  It's the same process that =20=

made various Europeans American, but, if "visibly lucky," hid the =20
"taint" of the process from the skin, but not from the soul.  I'd like =20=

to think that all the white people who voted for Obama either already =20=

understand and accept the burden of history that has always and =20
rightfully belonged to them and can now either publicly stop faking =20
the funk, or are now ready to take some steps towards being real about =20=

privilege, race, racism.  I'd like to think that all the white people =20=

who voted for Obama did so to (maybe only symbolically) own up to all =20=

the not-surprisingly race-based disparities in our system which was =20
built on slavery and disparity, accept that many people, white people, =20=

rigorously assimilated colored people, benefit from this system =20
whether they like it or not, whether they're sorry or not.  Once these =20=

admissions can be voiced and dealt with instead of brainily wormed =20
around, guiltily whined about, or totally shirked as a responsibility, =20=

once the burden of understanding and disassembling a woefully race-=20
obsessed culture is shifted to all shoulders (er, like the burden of =20
these racialized stereotypes of who's more homophobic, or religiously =20=

conservative), maybe once we have some real conversations about =20
whiteness instead of always harping on blackness, we can do some real =20=

self-reflexive work towards social change, and clearly, Obama won't be =20=

able to make this happen alone, even if he serves as many terms as =20
FDR.  This quibbling about Walcott's poem, sadly, or the unexamined =20
perpetuation of stereotypes and placement of burden re: Prop 8, says =20
something else about that readiness for even the conversation, never =20
mind the work and the sacrifice, but, I hope, only says something =20
about a few.

Troy, that was a thoughtful response, and thank you for thinking about it.
To be honest I'm not interested in marriage myself, and have many concerns
about the institution of marriage for anyone wanting it.  However, it's
still none of my business if someone wants it, I'm just saying.

And yes, you're right about the views many Americans, especially religious
Americans of any color have about this idea of homosexuality being a
"choice."

Cultures with fundamentals of dualistic foundations like monotheism trade
"choice" against the formation of belief that two is the best number to
shoot from:  God and Satan, Male and Female, Black and White, etc.  America
can't even seem to support values outside of a Democrat and Republican party
system.  Christianity in particular in American has reductive qualities
which marginalize with a world-view from proper biblical points of
reference.

American colonists were HORRIFIED by the openly bisexual, homosexual,
transsexual Native Americans of this early pagan continent.  There are
Native American nations who had multiple genders, which confused and FREAKED
many of the early white Americans.  Well, not so much the Scotts and Irish
who settled in Appalachia maybe, but certainly the Virginians and the
Puritans, even the Quakers.

Am I saying we're too entrenched to get out of it?  No, I mean look at many
European countries who are also steeped in Christianity, they've become more
tolerant, but they also forced the issue of progress with governmental
intervention and laws.  I say this because I'm under the impression that the
Libertarian Party is about less governmental intervention.  But I admit I
know little about that party, but that's the gist I've gotten from them.

I'm actually for MORE regulation of all kinds, especially when it comes to
civil rights.  I'm not believing for a minute that it will make The
Haters like queers more, but it will protect queers who want to be
productive, contributing citizens if they so choose.

Back in the early 90s I heard Bill Clinton give a speech in DC when he was
first running for president, it was at some gay pride event, or march, or
something.  He said, and I remember him clearly saying this, that Yes we
should be allowed to be married, have the same rights, etc.  He instead gave
us the "right" of "Don't Ask Don't Tell" which was tantamount to saying,
"No, you're not equal, unless you're a killing machine."

But I remember how we all CHEERED and ROARED with excitement when Clinton
addressed us in DC.  And weeks after he and Gore won The White House I took
a lesbian friend of mine to see KD Lang for her birthday, it was Lang's
"Ingenue Tour" I believe.  But Lang ANNOUNCED from the stage these very same
things Clinton promised, and we all CHEERED and ROARED with excitement!  And
I still remember her saying through a cloud of bubbles (she had a giant
bubble-making machine on stage like Lawrence Welk), "I'm so glad Bill's in
office!"  We all CHEERED and ROARED again.  We were literally ecstatic!
Little did we know the real Bill Clinton at that time.  We were such suckers
for his promises at a time when we were SO EXHAUSTED from Reagan/Bush, and
hemorrhaging friends and the art world to AIDS.  It blew our minds that he
would even speak to us.  But we were SO duped!  He got our votes and
promptly dumped us.  WORSE than dumping us, MUCH WORSE, that asshole signed
the Defense of Marriage Act.  Wow!  I will always, ALWAYS hate Bill Clinton
for that signing!

Bill Clinton's legacy of lies is why I'm skeptical of Obama.  BUT, I do
believe Obama is a better human being than Bill Clinton ever was, even on
Clinton's best days.  I want Obama to be the man of conscience he appears to
be.  And I hope he is.  But still, saying queers should be allowed to visit
their dying partner in the hospital is hardly a step up from what Clinton
gave us.  Both Biden and Obama used this remark about hospital visitation,
and it made me angry.  But AT LEAST THEY DIDN'T lie.  I mean, neither man
promised us things like Clinton, so, I am grateful for that.  I'd rather be
told up front what to expect, which they gave.

Getting our greedy, bloodstained American hands out of Iraq was most
important to me when voting.  Everyone who voted for Obama had their
reasons.  Everyone FELT GOOD voting for Obama for their own reasons, and
mine was his steadfast claim that Iraq was wrong, was always wrong, and we
should get out.  I don't care about his gender or the color of his skin, his
courage to stand up against the American invasion and occupation of Iraq is
what sent me to vote.  And I don't use the word "courage" lightly.  It takes
REAL courage to tell a nation of people that they fucked up.  But he did it,
and we made him president, so that alone makes me hopeful.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I do find it funny that someone on a poetry group is complaining about using words to label things, as that's what all words do. Words do mean things, even if there may be some ambiguity. And like things are typically groups together under a single label. It's useful to label wolves as wolves, and wolves, foxes, coyotes, and jackals as dogs.


If I did not intend "screeching" as sexist, then it's not sexist. Your choosing to interpret it as sexist means you are the poor interpreter of my meaning. It's simply bad textual analysis on your part, attributing meaning the author did not in any way intend. Next you'll be telling me MacBeth is about growing pine trees in Scotland.

And you will note that I did engage the issues, and I was decent enough to acknowledge that you had to. It seems you don't have the decency to extend to me the same courtesy. My pride is not hurt -- though your thinking it does clearly IS sexist on your part. Perhaps your sexism is why you see sexism where there isn't any?

The real absurdity here is that you don't seem to care that you and I in fact agree that marriage should be legally extended to everyone, regardless of the sex of the people getting married. What seems to matter most to you is that I'm not a liberal like yourself.

Troy,

Continuing to label my responses as so many "liberal tactics" carries on your condescension, and indeed, your characterization of my original reply as "screeching" most certainly is sexist, whether I "choose" to read it that way or not.  You're trying to shuck the weight of your words by making the weight they carry my burden to accept or deny them -- but you are the one flinging such nasty characterizations, and you have felt it historically necessary on this list to do so with many people (i.e.  "liberal tactics" is but one seeming insult in your Poetics List arsenal).  Why the urge to label and characterize responses on this list at all?

Why not take your own advice and just "engage the issues", as you continue to claim that I did not do.  In fact, I have done nothing but respond to your claims (re-read the whole thread below), as well as point out the ad hominem strains in your response.  It is this latter aspect of my reply that hurts your pride and raises the defensive hairs on your back.  But your style of arguing is full of unnecessary bait & attack that reminds me of Rush Limbaugh's "responses" to feminist claims -- if you call her an angry cow, you no longer have to listen to what she says; you need only paint a picture of her and ask that she be tamed, or try to tame her yourself.   "Screeching" runs along those same lines, like it or not ...


Regarding the meat of your argument, I'd like to know when the U.S. Government forced any church to hire people whose lifestyles they didn't approve of?  I really don't know about any instances of such legal intervention with any church regarding the hiring of gay clergy and am quite curious.  Were these instances in the Catholic church?

Additionally, I'd like to point out, though I use the term too, that even "gay marriages" seems misguided.  Marriages are marriages are marriages.  We don't say, "The government should perform bi-racial marriages."  Instead, we demand that everyone have the right to marry.  I suppose it would be difficult to keep saying, 'Give the right to marry to the GLBT community,' but perhaps demanding "Marriage Equality" instead could be a simple start to eliminating the marginialized thinking this issue sustains.

Be well,

Amy

I will only quickly note that this is the kind of argument I was merely asking
for, and that it is quite different in tone from the other posting -- though I
will criticize you on the fact that if mine was condescending, this was off the
barometer. Let's both make an effort to keep it civilized. Further, it's
you who chose to interpret my comment about screeching, etc. in a sexist
fashion. Another all-too-typical liberal tactic: to shut down arguments with
accusations of racism, sexism, etc. rather than engaging the issues. My
experience is that too many liberals are screechers, regardless of sex. If you
choose to take offense at my remarks, remember that it is you who are choosing
to take offense -- there is nothing inherently offensive in what I wrote.
Finally, a good idea is a good idea, no matter where it comes from. I think
almost every thought of Marx's is pure evil -- but when he has a good idea,
he has a good idea. Don't disregard Sun Tzu just
because he was an aristocrat -- he was an aristocrat who won wars (if I were a
liberal, I would accuse you of disregarding him because he was Chinese,
something I'm certain is absurd).

That having been said, I do take several of your points. The civil rights
arguments are an excellent approach. Having been raised a Baptist in Kentucky,
and being now married to an Hispanic, I think I have some expertise in the areas
of which I speak. My experience is that religious people rather claim that
homosexuality is "unnatural." This is quickly undermined by the
aforementioned examples, which puts them in a tight rhetorical spot, as they now
have to regroup and argue that "well, we're not animals. We're
supposed to be better." I typically then direct them to their previous
argument. If they claim it's a mater of choice, I can and have proven
otherwise. Having demonstrated the incoherence of their argument, they have
typically then been more receptive to other arguments regarding civil rights,
etc. The real issue for many religious people, I think, is less that the
government "recognize" gay marriage than that they have a fear that
the government
will turn around and force their church to perform gay marriage ceremonies.
There have been several cases of churches being forced by law to hire someone
whose lifestyle they did not approve of, so their fears are not entirely
unfounded. It seems to me, then, that if we are going to win this argument, we
have to figure out a way to assuage those concerns. And if we are truly
believers in a separation of church and state, we cannot use the state to force
the churches to accept our world view. That should, in fact, require persuasion
rather than laws. One could also point out to fundamentalists that there is much
prohibited by the Bible we do not bother with, so why are we picking and
choosing? I recommend Peter McWilliams' "Ain't Nobody's
Business If You Do" for some excellent arguments along those lines.

Having grown up on the Bible Belt in Stone Mountain, GA, I used to be one of
those "religious people" and, as such, continue to communicate with
them.  My response to you *is* my response to those religious people you've
determined I don't understand.

However, I don't need you to explain to me "how people think" and
how to respond, verbatim, to "African Americans and Hispanics" -- for
you to be so elementary and condescending is just another tactic to avoid
engaging my reasonable response to your arguments, which I find as base as those
put forth by religious people you dubbed yourself an expert on.

Now, I'll explain to you how my reply, as an argument, works.

1.  I refuse to engage with religious folks, and anyone else, on the basis of
the "Nature vs. Nurture" level simply because to do so inevitably
devolves into a moral discussion typically reliant on the Holy Bible as the
authority of choice.  I don't base my argument on what the Holy Bible
claims, but instead, keep the argument framed within the rights provided by the
U.S. Constitution.

Just because "that's how religious people think" doesn't mean
I must concede and allow them to use that bible as the foundation of this
argument (recall separation of church and state).  I can engage them without
such concessions -- and do.  In fact, the argument for civil rights, however
based in morality vs. immortality for them, is truly not about whose moral
barometer is correct at all, as I imagine you know -- it is a matter of rights
*for everyone* despite and including our differences, even moral ones, as
acknowledged by separation of church and state.

2.  My calling the "Nature vs. Nurture" debate a perversion should
have tipped you off, since the rest didn't.  They like to call homosexuality
a "perversion," but debating its existence as one of nature v. nurture
to determine who gets what rights is itself a perversion.

3.  Further, you have included in your "argument" the very kind of
thinking religious people resort to -- that of arguing the very existence of
homosexuality as "proven" by its existence in nature.  Who cares?
(That's a rhetorical one, Troy.  I know who cares.)  The point is that you
argue a biological basis for homosexuality as evidenced in the behavior of
animals.  Religious folks will argue in return that we aren't animals and
shouldn't be gay just because they might be by some freak of nature.  (Plus
they like to take being gay a step further with this argument and ask if
we'd like to marry goats next -- with a snort and a 'ha ha' to
finalize the absurdity of the entire proposition).

Why resort to such tactics?  Just because they do?  Just because that's
where they might find their moral footing?  Nearly equating homosexuality with
animals (I know, you didn't) only denigrates any merit for seeking rights as
people who are different than them -- despite our differences, even in morality
-- and certainly does not change their minds.  It never has.  Bringing the proof
of animal behavior into the argument only distracts and opens the door for
tasteless jokes at the expense of any legitimacy for the claim to civil rights
for each and every person in this country.  (I say in the face of whether we
should exist or not, we do and we will not go away, marriage rights or no.
Whether we choose to be gay or are "born that way", who I love is my
*choice* and I certainly have the right to choose).

Finally, characterizing my reply as "screeching" and labeling it as
the "liberal social agenda" -- even only by association -- as well as
claiming I didn't read your post in favor of "spouting off talking
points" is a typically sexist admonishment and so much ad hominem name
calling used to avoid engaging the tenets of the argument I actually laid out in
direct reply to your post.  In this elementary manner, you get to ride in on
your noble steed and re-frame our discussion by writing me off as some sort of
lil' unworldly & uninformed lady who needs the religious-minded
explained to me so that I can "know my enemy" via another nobleman you
conjure, Sun Tzu.

I'm sorry; I won't bat my eyes and be impressed that you "found my
naivete out."  Instead, I'll suggest you engage with the actual basis
of my argument and ask you to please stop being unnecessarily instructive.
Consider us on equal footing intellectually and go from there.

In response to your last post regarding why folks who voted for Obama would
also vote for Prop 8, I would say that the African Americans and Hispanics you
cite were not solely responsible for its passage.  Yes, I understand on an exit
poll that they voted for it 7 to 10, their turn-out was up percentage points,
etc.  But this Prop 8 campaign was quite well-funded by the Mormon church and
was built and thrived on fear.  McCain also attempted to run his campaign on
fear; his tactic lost where the Mormons scared a good number of Californians
into believing all sorts of ridiculous notions reliant on the idea that marriage
itself would be threatened and worthless if everyone were allowed that right.
Regarding the communities you name:  the LGBT community did not go into those
neighborhoods and educate; the Mormon fear campaign ran rampant, hence the exit
polls.   It's a complicated mix of who sold who on what fear; who spoke out
for their rights and
where, and who simply doesn't care if everyone has the same rights,
particularly where their own aren't threatened.

But to take on the religious tenets of the Mormon church (Joseph Smith's
ideals, no less!) and debate them on their way of thinking, particularly in
terms of Nature vs. Nurture as you suggest, certainly will not advance the fight
for those rights nor will it render the fear mongering ineffective.  To change
the ways of thinking about this issue and frame the debate in legal terms will
go a lot further, and has historically done so.  In other words:  It's okay
if you don't like my lifestyle, or if you don't like my skin tone, or
you think my religion is not as good as yours; it's your right to think that
way, but I'm a citizen of this country, pay my taxes, participate in the
cogs of our economy, and am a citizen under the eyes of the law -- ergo, I
deserve my rights the same as every other person in this country.

Be well,

Amy

Sometimes I wonder if anyone actually reads what anyone says and considers
their
actual arguments or if they just act like politicians and spout off their
talking points regardless.

The question of whether or not "being gay" is natural or a choice is
not "beyond moot" to those againstgay marriage. To such people, their
belief that being gay is a choice has everything to do with it. They would
argue
that choosing to be gay is like choosing to be a murderer, and insofar as both
are immoral, both should be opposed. I, of course, to not consider this to be
the case. I too understand that sexuality is fluid and that, as a species, Homo
sapiens, like our close relatives the bonobos, are a bisexual species. Less
bisexual than bonobos, but more so than chimpanzees. The fact that hazy
sexuality is a biological fact in the human species is not moot, and is in fact
a benefit to those who want to argue for civil rightsrecognitions. If you want
to make any headway on this issue, you have to understand the position of the
opposition. "Know your enemy as you know yourself and you will not
fail." -- Sun Tzu. The reason so many liberals can't get
anything done is that you think screeching at the top of your lungs is what
gets things done, and you don't even bother to try to argue your point. And
your lack of understanding of how people think -- especially religious people
--
is what prevents you from understanding how Obama can win the Presidency, but
the African-Americans and Hispanics who voted for them voted against the
liberal
social agenda. I'm trying to explain it to you, and all you have to say is
that their reasons, which they consider to be central to their belief system,
is
merely a "moot point." It's condescending to them, and won't
win any arguments with them.

Subject: Civil Unions vs. Marriage -- "Separate But Equal" [Troy
& Mark]

Troy,

The question of being gay as "natural" or a "choice" is
beyond moot.  Since the constitution provides everyone equal rights - ahem - I
should be allowed to marry whomever I choose, so long as they consent and
choose
me as well.  To devolve into such debate over whether the selection of
one's
spouse is a choice, a coercion, a divine intervention, a prophetic union, or
what-have-you is to distract from the purposes & securities provided by the
constitution.  That we *must* be separated by gender was not something our
forefathers predicted would be problematic -- any more than when they wrote
that
some people weren't exactly human and could be owned as chattel.

But in an age when it is beginning to be acknowledged that gender lines are, at
best, blurred and complex, sexes are multiple (despite "corrective"
measures - http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/magazine/24intersexkids.html &
http://www.jenellerose.com/htmlpostings/intersex_babies_controversy.htm), and,
like it or not, gender is fluid, to create an amendment defining marriage as
between a "man" and a "woman" is institutionalized bias.
Devolving into the archaic debate of just what penis and vagina should be
allowed a legally-sanctioned U.S. Gov't issued contract is silly and a
distracting fallacy.  Two people should be granted the same rights as any other
two people as written in the constitution.  This debate heralds back to the
not-so-old one of whether it was "right" that blacks and whites be
allowed the same rights under the law, as if the races were two different
species (see anti-miscegenation laws).  It wasn't so long ago that people
thought it
"unnatural" to see two separate skin tones loving one another.  Some
still think it "unnatural."   The debate of nature vs nurture is
itself a perversion.

An aside:  I think the passing of Prop 8 speaks moreover to the hope that by
denying the GLBT community the right to marry will somehow abolish the very
existence of that community -- at least, that's my pessimistic read on the
whole debacle.   Gays/lesbians are the latest "Other" just as
immigrants remain "Alien" on the soil of a people obsessed with
"getting and keeping theirs."


Mark,

Separations of symbols vs. legalities not withstanding, civil unions and
domestic partnerships do NOT provide the same legal benefits that marriages do.

It's all in the poetic wording, no?   "Separate but equal" has
historically betrayed everyone's "good" intentions.  If
"civil unions" were to be federally-mandated, then perhaps that would
cover the legal protections that marriages do, but until then:


What are some of the limitations of civil unions?



    Civil unions are different from marriage, and that difference has
    wide-ranging implications that make the two institutions unequal. Here
    is a quick look at some of the most significant differences:



    -Portability:



    Marriages are respected state to state for all purposes, but questions
    remain about how civil unions will be treated in other states.
    GLAD
    believes there are strong arguments that civil unions deserve respect
    across the country just like marriages. But the two appellate courts
    that have addressed the issue (in Connecticut and Georgia) have
    disrespected them based on the fact that their states do not grant civil
unions themselves.



    -Ending a Civil Union:



    If you are married, you can get divorced in any state in which you are a
    resident. But if states continue to disrespect civil unions, there is
    no way to end the relationship other than by establishing residency in
    Vermont and filing for divorce there. This has already created problems
    for some couples who now have no way to terminate their legal
    commitment.



    -Federal Benefits:



    According to a 1997 GAO report, civil marriage brings with it at least
    1,049 legal protections and responsibilities from the federal
    government, including the right to take leave from work to care for a
    family member, the right to sponsor a spouse for immigration purposes,
    and Social Security survivor benefits that can make a difference between
    old age in poverty and old age in security. Civil unions bring none of
    these critical legal protections.



    -Taxes & Public Benefits for the Family:



    Because the federal government does not respect civil unions, a couple
    with a civil union will be in a kind of limbo with regard to
    governmental functions performed by both state and federal governments,
    such as taxation, pension protections, provision of insurance for
    families, and means-tested programs like Medicaid. Even when states try
    to provide legal protections, they may be foreclosed from doing so in
    joint federal/state programs.



    -Filling out forms:



    Every day, we fill out forms that ask us whether we are married or
    single. People joined in a civil union don't fit into either category.
    People with civil unions should be able to identify themselves as a
    single family unit, but misrepresenting oneself on official documents
    can be considered fraud and carries potential serious criminal

    penalties.



    -Separate & Unequal -- Second-Class Status:



    Even if there were no substantive differences in the way the law treated
    marriages and civil unions, the fact that a civil union remains a
    separate status just for gay people represents real and powerful
    inequality. We've been down this road before in this country and should
    not kid ourselves that a separate institution just for gay people is a
    just solution here either. Our constitution requires legal equality for
    all. Including gay and lesbian couples within existing marriage laws is
    the fairest and simplest thing to do.



    How real are these differences between marriage and civil unions, given
    that a federal law and some state laws discriminate against all
    marriages of same-sex couples?



    Would any of this change immediately with marriage of same-sex couples?
    Probably not, because married same-sex couples will face other layers of
    discrimination against their marriages. Right now, a federal law denies
    recognition of same-sex unions conferred by any state for purposes of
    all federal programs and requirements and over 30 state laws do the
    same. Ending discrimination in marriage does not mean the end of all
    discrimination, but using the term "marriage" rather than
"civil union"
    is an essential first step to opening the door and addressing whether
    continued governmental discrimination against civil marriages of gay and
    lesbian people makes sense.



    Marriage and civil unions remain different, both in practice and in

    principle.



    First, more than a dozen states have not taken a discriminatory position
    against civil marriages of gay and lesbian couples. In those states,
    civilly married gay and lesbian couples should be able to live and
    travel freely and without fear that their relationship will be
    disrespected.



    Second, even as to those states with discriminatory laws, legally
    married gay and lesbian couples from those states may well face some
    discrimination in some quarters, but their marriages will also be
    treated with legal respect in other arenas. Marriages are far more
    likely to be respected by others than newly minted "civil
unions."



    Using the term marriage also prompts a discussion about fairness.
    Allowing same sex couples to marry (rather than enter a separate status)
    will allow gay and lesbian people to talk with their neighbors, their
    local elected officials, and the Congress about whether discrimination
    against their marriages is fair. Where gay and lesbian people and their
    children are part of the social fabric, is it right to continue
    discriminating against them in civil marriage? The federal government
    and states that have taken discriminatory positions against marriages of
    gay and lesbian couples could rethink those policies and go back to
    respecting state laws about marriage, as they have done for hundreds of
    years. In the end, we will not be able to have this discussion until
    gay and lesbian folks have what everyone else
    has: civil marriage.

I do find it funny that someone on a poetry group is complaining about usin=

words to label things, as that's what all words do. Words do mean things,
even if there may be some ambiguity. And like things are typically groups
together under a single label. It's useful to label wolves as wolves, and
wolves, foxes, coyotes, and jackals as dogs.=20


If I did not intend "screeching" as sexist, then it's not sexist.
Your choosing to interpret it as sexist means you are the poor interpreter =
of my
meaning. It's simply bad textual analysis on your part, attributing meaning
the author did not in any way intend. Next you'll be telling me MacBeth is
about growing pine trees in Scotland.=20

here
there isn't any?

The real absurdity here is that you don't seem to care that you and I in
fact agree that marriage should be legally extended to everyone, regardless=
 of
the sex of the people getting married. What seems to matter most to you is =

Troy,

Continuing to label my responses as so many "liberal tactics" carries
on your condescension, and indeed, your characterization of my original rep=
ly as
"screeching" most certainly is sexist, whether I "choose" to
read it that way or not.  You're trying to shuck the weight of your words b=
y
making the weight they carry my burden to accept or deny them -- but you ar=
e the
one flinging such nasty characterizations, and you have felt it historicall=
y
necessary on this list to do so with many people (i.e.  "liberal
tactics" is but one seeming insult in your Poetics List arsenal).  Why the
urge to label and characterize responses on this list at all?

Why not take your own advice and just "engage the issues", as you
continue to claim that I did not do.  In fact, I have done nothing but resp=
ond
to your claims (re-read the whole thread below), as well as point out the a=
d
hominem strains in your response.  It is this latter aspect of my reply tha=
t
hurts your pride and raises the defensive hairs on your back.  But your sty=
le of
arguing is full of unnecessary bait & attack that reminds me of Rush
Limbaugh's "responses" to feminist claims -- if you call her an
angry cow, you no longer have to listen to what she says; you need only pai=
nt a
picture of her and ask that she be tamed, or try to tame her yourself. =20
"Screeching" runs along those same lines, like it or not ...=20


Regarding the meat of your argument, I'd like to know when the U.S.
Government forced any church to hire people whose lifestyles they didn't
approve of?  I really don't know about any instances of such legal
intervention with any church regarding the hiring of gay clergy and am quit=
e
curious.  Were these instances in the Catholic church? =20

Additionally, I'd like to point out, though I use the term too, that even
"gay marriages" seems misguided.  Marriages are marriages are
marriages.  We don't say, "The government should perform bi-racial
marriages."  Instead, we demand that everyone have the right to marry.  I
suppose it would be difficult to keep saying, 'Give the right to marry to
the GLBT community,' but perhaps demanding "Marriage Equality"
instead could be a simple start to eliminating the marginialized thinking t=
his
issue sustains. =20

Be well,

Amy

I will only quickly note that this is the kind of argument I was merely ask=
ing
for, and that it is quite different in tone from the other posting -- thoug=
h I
will criticize you on the fact that if mine was condescending, this was off=
 the
barometer. Let's both make an effort to keep it civilized. Further,
it's
you who chose to interpret my comment about screeching, etc. in a sexist
fashion. Another all-too-typical liberal tactic: to shut down arguments wit=
h
accusations of racism, sexism, etc. rather than engaging the issues. My
experience is that too many liberals are screechers, regardless of sex. If =
you
choose to take offense at my remarks, remember that it is you who are choos=
ing
to take offense -- there is nothing inherently offensive in what I wrote.
Finally, a good idea is a good idea, no matter where it comes from. I think
almost every thought of Marx's is pure evil -- but when he has a good idea,
he has a good idea. Don't disregard Sun Tzu just
because he was an aristocrat -- he was an aristocrat who won wars (if I wer=
e a
liberal, I would accuse you of disregarding him because he was Chinese,
something I'm certain is absurd).=20

That having been said, I do take several of your points. The civil rights
arguments are an excellent approach. Having been raised a Baptist in Kentuc=
ky,
and being now married to an Hispanic, I think I have some expertise in the
areas
of which I speak. My experience is that religious people rather claim that
homosexuality is "unnatural." This is quickly undermined by the
aforementioned examples, which puts them in a tight rhetorical spot, as the=
y
now
have to regroup and argue that "well, we're not animals. We're
supposed to be better." I typically then direct them to their previous
argument. If they claim it's a mater of choice, I can and have proven
otherwise. Having demonstrated the incoherence of their argument, they have
typically then been more receptive to other arguments regarding civil right=
s,
etc. The real issue for many religious people, I think, is less that the
government "recognize" gay marriage than that they have a fear that
the government
will turn around and force their church to perform gay marriage ceremonies.
There have been several cases of churches being forced by law to hire someo=
ne
whose lifestyle they did not approve of, so their fears are not entirely
unfounded. It seems to me, then, that if we are going to win this argument,=
 we
have to figure out a way to assuage those concerns. And if we are truly
believers in a separation of church and state, we cannot use the state to f=
orce
the churches to accept our world view. That should, in fact, require persua=
sion
rather than laws. One could also point out to fundamentalists that there is
much
prohibited by the Bible we do not bother with, so why are we picking and
choosing? I recommend Peter McWilliams' "Ain't Nobody's
Business If You Do" for some excellent arguments along those lines.=20

Subject: Re: Civil Unions vs. Marriage -- "Separate But Equal" [Troy
& Mark]

Troy,

I know this will be difficult to admit, but your reply, and often times you=
r
style of arguing here, is hypocritical in its condescension. =20

Having grown up on the Bible Belt in Stone Mountain, GA, I used to be one o=
f
those "religious people" and, as such, continue to communicate with
them.  My response to you *is* my response to those religious people you've
determined I don't understand.

However, I don't need you to explain to me "how people think" and
how to respond, verbatim, to "African Americans and Hispanics" -- for
you to be so elementary and condescending is just another tactic to avoid
engaging my reasonable response to your arguments, which I find as base as
those
put forth by religious people you dubbed yourself an expert on.

Now, I'll explain to you how my reply, as an argument, works.

1.  I refuse to engage with religious folks, and anyone else, on the basis =
of
the "Nature vs. Nurture" level simply because to do so inevitably
devolves into a moral discussion typically reliant on the Holy Bible as the
authority of choice.  I don't base my argument on what the Holy Bible
claims, but instead, keep the argument framed within the rights provided by=
 the
U.S. Constitution. =20

Just because "that's how religious people think" doesn't mean
I must concede and allow them to use that bible as the foundation of this
argument (recall separation of church and state).  I can engage them withou=
t
such concessions -- and do.  In fact, the argument for civil rights, howeve=
r
based in morality vs. immortality for them, is truly not about whose moral
barometer is correct at all, as I imagine you know -- it is a matter of rig=
hts
*for everyone* despite and including our differences, even moral ones, as
acknowledged by separation of church and state.

2.  My calling the "Nature vs. Nurture" debate a perversion should
have tipped you off, since the rest didn't.  They like to call
homosexuality
a "perversion," but debating its existence as one of nature v.
nurture
to determine who gets what rights is itself a perversion. =20
 =20
3.  Further, you have included in your "argument" the very kind of
thinking religious people resort to -- that of arguing the very existence o=
f
homosexuality as "proven" by its existence in nature.  Who cares?=20
(That's a rhetorical one, Troy.  I know who cares.)  The point is that you
argue a biological basis for homosexuality as evidenced in the behavior of
animals.  Religious folks will argue in return that we aren't animals and
shouldn't be gay just because they might be by some freak of nature.  (Plus
they like to take being gay a step further with this argument and ask if
we'd like to marry goats next -- with a snort and a 'ha ha' to
finalize the absurdity of the entire proposition). =20

Why resort to such tactics?  Just because they do?  Just because that's
where they might find their moral footing?  Nearly equating homosexuality w=
ith
animals (I know, you didn't) only denigrates any merit for seeking rights
as
people who are different than them -- despite our differences, even in mora=
lity
-- and certainly does not change their minds.  It never has.  Bringing the
proof
of animal behavior into the argument only distracts and opens the door for
tasteless jokes at the expense of any legitimacy for the claim to civil rig=
hts
for each and every person in this country.  (I say in the face of whether w=
e
should exist or not, we do and we will not go away, marriage rights or no.=
=20
Whether we choose to be gay or are "born that way", who I love is my
*choice* and I certainly have the right to choose).

Finally, characterizing my reply as "screeching" and labeling it as
the "liberal social agenda" -- even only by association -- as well as
claiming I didn't read your post in favor of "spouting off talking
points" is a typically sexist admonishment and so much ad hominem name
calling used to avoid engaging the tenets of the argument I actually laid o=
ut
in direct reply to your post.  In this elementary manner, you get to ride i=
n on
your noble steed and re-frame our discussion by writing me off as some sort=
 of
lil' unworldly & uninformed lady who needs the religious-minded
explained to me so that I can "know my enemy" via another nobleman
you conjure, Sun Tzu. =20

I'm sorry; I won't bat my eyes and be impressed that you "found my
naivete out."  Instead, I'll suggest you engage with the actual basis
of my argument and ask you to please stop being unnecessarily instructive.=
=20
Consider us on equal footing intellectually and go from there. =20

In response to your last post regarding why folks who voted for Obama would
also vote for Prop 8, I would say that the African Americans and Hispanics =
you
cite were not solely responsible for its passage.  Yes, I understand on an =
exit
poll that they voted for it 7 to 10, their turn-out was up percentage point=
s,
etc.  But this Prop 8 campaign was quite well-funded by the Mormon church a=
nd
was built and thrived on fear.  McCain also attempted to run his campaign o=
n
fear; his tactic lost where the Mormons scared a good number of Californian=
s
into believing all sorts of ridiculous notions reliant on the idea that
marriage itself would be threatened and worthless if everyone were allowed =
that right.=20
Regarding the communities you name:  the LGBT community did not go into tho=
se
neighborhoods and educate; the Mormon fear campaign ran rampant, hence the =
exit
polls.   It's a complicated mix of who sold who on what fear; who spoke out
for their rights and where, and who simply doesn't care if everyone has the=
 same rights,
particularly where their own aren't threatened. =20

But to take on the religious tenets of the Mormon church (Joseph Smith's
ideals, no less!) and debate them on their way of thinking, particularly in
terms of Nature vs. Nurture as you suggest, certainly will not advance the
fight
for those rights nor will it render the fear mongering ineffective.  To cha=
nge
the ways of thinking about this issue and frame the debate in legal terms w=
ill
go a lot further, and has historically done so.  In other words:  It's okay
if you don't like my lifestyle, or if you don't like my skin tone, or
you think my religion is not as good as yours; it's your right to think
that way, but I'm a citizen of this country, pay my taxes, participate in t=
he
cogs of our economy, and am a citizen under the eyes of the law -- ergo, I
deserve my rights the same as every other person in this country. =20

Be well,

Sometimes I wonder if anyone actually reads what anyone says and considers
their
actual arguments or if they just act like politicians and spout off their
talking points regardless.

The question of whether or not "being gay" is natural or a choice is
not "beyond moot" to those againstgay marriage. To such people, their
belief that being gay is a choice has everything to do with it. They would
argue
that choosing to be gay is like choosing to be a murderer, and insofar as b=
oth
are immoral, both should be opposed. I, of course, to not consider this to =
be
the case. I too understand that sexuality is fluid and that, as a species, =
Homo
sapiens, like our close relatives the bonobos, are a bisexual species. Less
bisexual than bonobos, but more so than chimpanzees. The fact that hazy
sexuality is a biological fact in the human species is not moot, and is in =
fact
a benefit to those who want to argue for civil rightsrecognitions. If you w=
ant
to make any headway on this issue, you have to understand the position of t=

opposition. "Know your enemy as you know yourself and you will not

gets things done, and you don't even bother to try to argue your point. And
your lack of understanding of how people think -- especially religious peop=

is what prevents you from understanding how Obama can win the Presidency, b=
ut
the African-Americans and Hispanics who voted for them voted against the
liberal
social agenda. I'm trying to explain it to you, and all you have to say is
that their reasons, which they consider to be central to their belief syste=

is
merely a "moot point." It's condescending to them, and won't

Troy,

The question of being gay as "natural" or a "choice" is
beyond moot.  Since the constitution provides everyone equal rights - ahem =
- I
should be allowed to marry whomever I choose, so long as they consent and
choose me as well.  To devolve into such debate over whether the selection =
of
one's spouse is a choice, a coercion, a divine intervention, a prophetic un=
ion, or
what-have-you is to distract from the purposes & securities provided by the
constitution.  That we *must* be separated by gender was not something our
forefathers predicted would be problematic -- any more than when they wrote
that some people weren't exactly human and could be owned as chattel. =20

But in an age when it is beginning to be acknowledged that gender lines are=
, at
best, blurred and complex, sexes are multiple (despite "corrective"
measures - http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/magazine/24intersexkids.html &
http://www.jenellerose.com/htmlpostings/intersex_babies_controversy.htm), a=
nd,
like it or not, gender is fluid, to create an amendment defining marriage a=
s
between a "man" and a "woman" is institutionalized bias.=20
Devolving into the archaic debate of just what penis and vagina should be
allowed a legally-sanctioned U.S. Gov't issued contract is silly and a
distracting fallacy.  Two people should be granted the same rights as any o=
ther
two people as written in the constitution.  This debate heralds back to the
not-so-old one of whether it was "right" that blacks and whites be
allowed the same rights under the law, as if the races were two different
species (see anti-miscegenation laws).  It wasn't so long ago that people
thought it "unnatural" to see two separate skin tones loving one another.  =
Some
still think it "unnatural."   The debate of nature vs nurture is
itself a perversion. =20

An aside:  I think the passing of Prop 8 speaks moreover to the hope that b=
y
denying the GLBT community the right to marry will somehow abolish the very
existence of that community -- at least, that's my pessimistic read on the
whole debacle.   Gays/lesbians are the latest "Other" just as
immigrants remain "Alien" on the soil of a people obsessed with
"getting and keeping theirs." =20


Mark,=20

Separations of symbols vs. legalities not withstanding, civil unions and
domestic partnerships do NOT provide the same legal benefits that marriages=
 do.

It's all in the poetic wording, no?   "Separate but equal" has
historically betrayed everyone's "good" intentions.  If
"civil unions" were to be federally-mandated, then perhaps that would
cover the legal protections that marriages do, but until then:


What are some of the limitations of civil unions?

   =20

    Civil unions are different from marriage, and that difference has
    wide-ranging implications that make the two institutions unequal. Here
    is a quick look at some of the most significant differences:=20

   =20

    -Portability:

   =20

    Marriages are respected state to state for all purposes, but questions
    remain about how civil unions will be treated in other states.=20
    GLAD
    believes there are strong arguments that civil unions deserve respect
    across the country just like marriages. But the two appellate courts
    that have addressed the issue (in Connecticut and Georgia) have
    disrespected them based on the fact that their states do not grant civi=
l
unions themselves.

   =20

    -Ending a Civil Union:

   =20

    If you are married, you can get divorced in any state in which you are =
a
    resident. But if states continue to disrespect civil unions, there is
    no way to end the relationship other than by establishing residency in
    Vermont and filing for divorce there. This has already created problems
    for some couples who now have no way to terminate their legal
    commitment.

   =20

    -Federal Benefits:

   =20

    According to a 1997 GAO report, civil marriage brings with it at least
    1,049 legal protections and responsibilities from the federal
    government, including the right to take leave from work to care for a
    family member, the right to sponsor a spouse for immigration purposes,
    and Social Security survivor benefits that can make a difference betwee=
n
    old age in poverty and old age in security. Civil unions bring none of
    these critical legal protections.

   =20

    -Taxes & Public Benefits for the Family:

   =20

    Because the federal government does not respect civil unions, a couple
    with a civil union will be in a kind of limbo with regard to
    governmental functions performed by both state and federal governments,
    such as taxation, pension protections, provision of insurance for
    families, and means-tested programs like Medicaid. Even when states try
    to provide legal protections, they may be foreclosed from doing so in
    joint federal/state programs.

   =20

    -Filling out forms:

   =20

    Every day, we fill out forms that ask us whether we are married or
    single. People joined in a civil union don't fit into either category.
    People with civil unions should be able to identify themselves as a
    single family unit, but misrepresenting oneself on official documents
    can be considered fraud and carries potential serious criminal

    penalties.=20

   =20

    -Separate & Unequal -- Second-Class Status:

   =20

    Even if there were no substantive differences in the way the law treate=
d
    marriages and civil unions, the fact that a civil union remains a
    separate status just for gay people represents real and powerful
    inequality. We've been down this road before in this country and should
    not kid ourselves that a separate institution just for gay people is a
    just solution here either. Our constitution requires legal equality for
    all. Including gay and lesbian couples within existing marriage laws is
    the fairest and simplest thing to do.

   =20

    How real are these differences between marriage and civil unions, given
    that a federal law and some state laws discriminate against all
    marriages of same-sex couples?

   =20

    Would any of this change immediately with marriage of same-sex couples?
    Probably not, because married same-sex couples will face other layers o=
f
    discrimination against their marriages. Right now, a federal law denies
    recognition of same-sex unions conferred by any state for purposes of
    all federal programs and requirements and over 30 state laws do the
    same. Ending discrimination in marriage does not mean the end of all
    discrimination, but using the term "marriage" rather than
"civil union"
    is an essential first step to opening the door and addressing whether
    continued governmental discrimination against civil marriages of gay an=
d
    lesbian people makes sense.=20

   =20

    Marriage and civil unions remain different, both in practice and in

    principle.=20

   =20

    First, more than a dozen states have not taken a discriminatory positio=
n
    against civil marriages of gay and lesbian couples. In those states,
    civilly married gay and lesbian couples should be able to live and
    travel freely and without fear that their relationship will be
    disrespected.

   =20

    Second, even as to those states with discriminatory laws, legally
    married gay and lesbian couples from those states may well face some
    discrimination in some quarters, but their marriages will also be
    treated with legal respect in other arenas. Marriages are far more
    likely to be respected by others than newly minted "civil
unions."

   =20

    Using the term marriage also prompts a discussion about fairness.
    Allowing same sex couples to marry (rather than enter a separate status=
)
    will allow gay and lesbian people to talk with their neighbors, their
    local elected officials, and the Congress about whether discrimination
    against their marriages is fair. Where gay and lesbian people and their
    children are part of the social fabric, is it right to continue
    discriminating against them in civil marriage? The federal government
    and states that have taken discriminatory positions against marriages o=
f
    gay and lesbian couples could rethink those policies and go back to
    respecting state laws about marriage, as they have done for hundreds of
    years. In the end, we will not be able to have this discussion until
    gay and lesbian folks have what everyone else
    has: civil marriage.

RULES=20
The Drunken Boat Design Contest is open to designers from any discipline,
from anywhere in the world, particularly individuals attuned to the
potential dynamicity of designing work online. We at Drunken Boat are open
to any number of aesthetic models that might encompass this issue=B9s
contents. Best of all would be an interactive / dynamic component that
actively invites reader participation. The only parameters of the contest
are that all of the home page designs must be structured to encompass a
group of 10 mini-sites designed by Drunken Boat Web Editor / Site Designer
Shawn M. McKinney. A sample of the visual design of the 10 mini-sites may b=
e
found here: www.drunkenboat.com/db10/designcontest.
=20
All entries will be considered potential home pages; some finalists may
ultimately provide alternate home page designs.
=20
NOTES=20
We don=B9t expect you to submit an entire Web site. We do expect you to
provide us with a clear sense of the graphic =B3look and feel=B2 of a home page=
,
as well as a proposed system of navigation, for Drunken Boat, Issue No. 10.
In addition, all proposed design elements must be aesthetically compatible
with the 10 mini-sites mentioned previously. Although your email
confirmation and digital artwork will be sufficient for our judges to asses=
s
your entry properly, contestants may physically mail design samples to allo=
w
for a more in-depth evaluation process. In any event, no materials will be
returned (unless prior arrangement has been reached). Please submit
disposable materials wherever possible.
=20
We urge you to explore the archives of www.drunkenboat.com. Take a look at
some of the creative work we have published in the past, while you consider
the design sensibility that has shaped previous issues. Also, you might wan=
t
to read the =B3designer=B9s note=B2 (essay) found in the Oulipo section of Drunke=

A spirit of collaboration is essential to the success of this contest and
this special issue of Drunken Boat. The winning designer will be expected t=
o
work closely with a staff of designers and editors to complete the design o=

Issue No. 10. Mavericks need not apply.

I think young people have an easier time living in a world without
such essentialist ideas of racial identity. A biracial cousin of my
husband's (he's white) used to say that she was two-tone in high
school. When I was giving the PSATs to a group of 10th graders in the
bay area, a number of kids said "I'm mixed, what do I put," when
forced to choose between African-American and White. While the school
I teach at is at times very racially divided, at other times the
boundaries between categories seem fluid.

One small corrective. By the primaries every Democrat was saying we
should get out of Iraq. Obama's courage consisted of saying it
earlier, when he had no vote in the matter and was running for office
with an antiwar costituency.

To troy's comment:

just b/c Obama wasn't a descendant of slaves doesn't mean he was ever
exempted from racism, you know? or discrimination.

when someone decides a black man isn't "trustworthy" (as I have heard many
many say of Obama) i don't think they're taking into account anything other
than color. the color has become the symbol for the feeling, institutional
and insidious as it is.  that's why, i think, walcott can get away with it.

the irony is there, you're right.  what walcott is marking/celebrating is
the change in symbol--what some people are hoping will be a wholesale
symbolic change.

good thread.

Dear David,
       Thanks for your reply. I reckon that you are , in so many words (as =
the expression goes) agreeing with me on the matter I raised, i.e. that giv=
en the varieties  And quantity of long canonised 'unoriginal' texts, art wo=
rks etc, to apply the term 'appropriation' to them all is reductive, and co=
unter-productive.
       I can't respond to all you say ( you raise so many interesting examp=
les and issues) nor can I agree with it all. Your 19th century US examples-=
-Poe, especially--are a propos; it has something to do with the belatedness=
 of US literary culture, so that Romantic and Pre-romantic ideas are contem=
porary, whereas is Europe they are in sequence. Your earlier comments about=
 travel lit and plagiarism apply to Meville; it was the true and false accu=
sations about Typee that drove Melville to fiction. Typee is srtill read by=
 many as Melville's forst novel--he never thought of it is as such.
       What I wanted to know was: in what ways do these  antecedent practic=
es assist in discriminating between
Recents forms of appropriation. I believe what we are discussing is somethi=
ng that has been--as you say-- going on along timem and something that we d=
o differently in our own time, and as usual we are short of terms for the l=
ater because of necessity we do not as yet understand it as conventional pr=
actice. Convention is a term you don't use, and yet it is deeply appropriat=
e to our discussion.
       Cheers,
    Wystan

Dear Wystan:

One of the interesting ways to think of appropriation through time is that =
it may often function not as a method of "creating of the previous/with the=
 previous" something "new," but, instead as a participating in many actions=
 which involve extension, reframing and as well, not making "fake" or "arti=
ficial" but paradoxically a kind of "return to realism."

For example:  Duchamp takes an object and puts it in an art gallery and cal=
ls it a "ready Made."  (Art off the rack," so to speak, with the "label"
being simply that the artist who chose the object said that is "art."

At the same time, to bring art "down from the high horse of abstraction,"
and "return to the reality at hand," the object itself is "a real object, s=
traight from the hardware store."

A "real object" becomes "an art object" simply by the moving of it from one=
 environment (hardware store) to another (art gallery).  Yet the object thu=
s "transformed" remains the same "real object" and hence it becomes  not ar=
t itself as abstract on the canvas or in a three-D object, or in a text, bu=
t an "abstract transaction" in the mind:  trans---action being the key word=
, as both a "transaction" in a commercial terms, and an action "beyond" or =
"through and out," a transit.

The effect of the transaction (hopefully) is to be that it sets in action t=
he realization that art happens in the mind, not only in the object, text, =
screen, canvas.

Duchamp said he wanted to make art which contradicted the French idiomatic =
phrase "Bete comme un peintre."  (Stupid like a painter--the stereotype of =
the painter of genius who is one in painting and/or sculpture, but when it =
comes to articulating any thoughts, "is at loss for words." and so appears =
to be "stupid like a painter."

In arts of appropriation, one is making use of a preexisting object, text, =
fragment, and so the work is anchored in a "reality," a "documentary"
aspect, which is to be played off of, or make a commentary on, the "fiction=
al" and "artificial" and if such is the case, "faked" aspects of the
work.   In this way, the work can question the nature of the construction o=
f
"reality" as already being being "made" of such a process in itself.

In collage art, the artist is simply doing what is already being done aroun=
d them--and commenting on it through re-editing, re-juxtaposing, transports=
 elements from one realm to another there to mingle with elements taken fro=
m others--Schwitter's method in his collages and Merzbau--Rauschenberg and =
his "Combines" and transfer works, etc.  Warhol's Factory production of ser=
ial versions of the same image, replicas of Campbell's Soup Cans, and the w=
hole Pop Art basis in recycling and reproducing "pop" imagery--treats the i=
mage world, already reproductions, mass productions, as in itself a reality=
, and so create the Pop reality which simply recycles itself as an endless =
system
of production.   These works in a sense are at once "artificial" and "real"
as the reality they are reproducing is an artificial one, in treating it as=
 real, it becomes again artificial (art) or--in treating it as already arti=
ficial (art) and reproducing it, taking elements fro it, it makes of a popu=
lar "artificiality" and "art artificiality" by the shifting of the frames f=
rom the comic book store or super market to the art gallery.

With writing, for thousands of years most likely, persons have gazed at som=
e landscape, city scene or sudden movement of the wind in tress and had a l=
ine of poetry come to their mind and/or lips as having "presented this to m=
e previously."  That is--this scene makes me think of a line of Pindar."  I=
n this way whole landscapes becomes the sites of tourism for those aficiona=
dos who want to see the "real Wuthering Heights," the places where Ulysses =
takes place," the New York of Edith Wharton, or the Paris of Baudelaire.  T=
he description and associations in writing in a sense create the place from=
 which they are seen as being created into a place which others "want to go=
 and see in all its reality," though that reality may have existed quite so=
me time ago or perhaps just six months ago.  "The scene of the crime," as i=
t were, to be gawked at and commented on further, with fotos taken and souv=
enirs purchased.

(Poe's "Morning on the Wissihcon" describes a proto-version this kind of li=
terary Disney  'world"--)

A writer like Herodotus is a forerunner of al these things, in that his His=
tories include everything--stories told that are fabulous, others that are =
"documented," speculations, wild eyed tales of wonders, all manner of thing=
s real, imaginary, fictional, hoaxed, are run togetehr as being simply what=
 the traveling historian has collected.  In this method of appropriation wh=
at is being accomplished "naturally" by Herodotus is today done as an attem=
pt to "blur," "transgress" boundaries and dividing lines between categories=
, classifications, into such separate things as "fables," "Facts,"
and "hoaxes."    The desire of many "post modern" projects and approaches
is, as Olson had propounded fifty years ago and more, found actually in the=
 pre-Aristotlean world of a writer like Herodotus, when no such classificat=
ory systems are being applied.  What is written of today as "transgressions=
," was all in a day's life and work for a traveling historian like Herodotu=
s or those "travel writers" of the early periods of Western colonialist exp=
ansions and explorations.

I keep bringing him up, but Poe is the first American writer to consistentl=
y use methods, let alone invent quite a number of his own, for creating hyb=
rids of facts, fictions, fakes, hoaxes, "newspaper items," and "detective s=
tories," one of which, "The Mystery of Marie Roget," was written along side=
 the actual tabloid sensation mystery of the murder and disappearance of th=
e body of Mary Rogers, "The Cigar Store Girl."  Via his fictional ratiocina=
ting "Dupin, Poe wanted to demonstrate that this method would more effectiv=
ely, efficiently and correctly solve the crime than the tabloid accounts of=
 the bumbling methods of the then rather haphazard assemblage of beings and=
 techniques that was the new York Police force.

(Conan Doyle with his Sherlock Holmes makes use of this inspiration of Poe'=
s in Sherlock Holmes' always using the London Times as vast treasure trove =
of textual evidences and clues.)

One of Poe's great dreams is to find the area of suspension between waking =
and dreaming, living and death--and in this manner be at the blurring of al=
l boundaries--an area i which reality and imagination, fictions and fakes, =
all are equally vivid and as it were living-dead.  Having observed the deat=
h of his mother, his brother and his young wife, Poe's desire to as much as=
 possible suspend the last instants of consciousness before its extinction =
is a "rational"desire and need for something that others deem "irrational."
Thus the work of Poe becomes ever more of a series of depictions in which t=
he ratiocination of the writing "detective" and "mathematician" try to hold=
 at bay the incoming flood tides of the Others--the living dead, the ghosts=
, the hearts beating through floorboards, the journey of Arthur Gordon Pym =
through a realm all in Black--Black people, birds, soil, letterings carved =
into black rock--and then white--the arrival finally at the edges of the ot=
her side of a printed page from the blackness of letters to its white space=
s--a figure of white that arises out of the whiteness of mists and is as wh=
ite as the whiteness of snow.  In effect--a "white out"--the termination of=
 writing as black notations on white pages and the the confrontation of a "=
white on white" aspect at the edges of what is NOT an erasure--as in Malevi=
ch's "White Square on a White Square" which had been preceded by the "Black=
 Square a Black Square."

In this narrative of Pym's, it is also noted that perhaps the reader wil no=
t notice at which point the narrative written by Pym stops and that written=
 by the person who is the editor of the published work begins.  The book is=
 supplied with an Appendix which in turn throws doubts on who actually did =
write the text, and if the editor is telling the truth, or if there is some=
 other aspect involved, and Pym himself has been perhaps the narrator all a=
long.

The making ambiguous and mysterious of a fictional account of journey that =
is fantastic yet described in the most precise "ship shape" manner and deta=
ils, is to further emphasize the idea that there can always be as it were "=
updates" on the status of a text and its "authorship."  That is, Poe is dem=
onstrating that even one's own texts can experience such disputes, as to wh=
at Poe really wrote, what was written by someone else whom he plagiarized o=
r "borrowed generously from."  In effect, the Appendix is implying--there c=
an continually be "news flash" updates on the status and authorship of this=
 text, and basically any other, as al texts participate in this madcap trav=
ersal of exchanges and exchange (stock exchange also).

Again, this method gives Poe the chance to "put off" the idea of their bein=
g "an ending"--in effect the "true story" has not yet been told, and so in =
the meantime one will be continually finding "news flashes' which bring one=
 the latest updates on the Poe-Pym voyages and authorships.

In Pym, the authors--both of them or more--are in a sense playing a game of=
 jack in the box with what are the various scenes of internment in the book=
--the whole tale finds Pym being confined in terribly close quarters, or in=
 a situation of captivity or near extinction.  In fact, we do  not know as =
the book begins whether or not Pym actually survived at al to tel this tale=
, as Mr Poe claims that he at some point is the author who takes up the pen=
 from the vanished Pym in order that his tale "might live on" so to speak.

When Pym shows up in the Appendix, live after, --this suddenly recasts the =
Narrative as a book which is actually not the book of the authors, either o=
ne--but one which is actually not yet written, but exists as it does "so fa=
r" in this "half man half horse" state of having the two seamless authors--=
one of them presumed dead and replaced part way through by a "ghost writer"=
 who has to face the return of the ghost as not a ghost once the text has b=
een "completed," and now lies on the floor, a ball of a "Yarn" (story) bein=
g madly unwoven by one of Poe's own "Imps of the Perverse."

Mark Twain is another form of writer in which appropriation is used on a va=
st scale, though in a way it may not at first seem so to be.  His books lik=
e Roughing It and Life on the Mississippi, for example, are vast Herodotus =
style compendiums of anecdote, facts, fictions, outright lies that he relis=
hes re-telling, pure unadulterated tall stories, wild characters who actual=
ly are real, and others who are characters "larger than life" because in fa=
ct they do not exist at all except as towering feats of story telling.

In Twain's world, the good telling of lie is a grandiose and magnificent th=
ing to behold--a great tall story, a superb "yarn," the getting togetehr of=
 literary and journalist friends "to swap a few lies," being the epitome of=
 a "good time."  These "lies" are contrasted to the bigger lies which Twain=
 continually attacks as the lies which society uses in order to create its =
structures of distinctions, borders and boundary lines between peoples and =
their social status, their possibilities in life, what their dreams are all=
owed to consist of.
Magnificent River Boats sail past cities with names like Memphis, Cairo, St=
 Louis, Nouvelle Orleans--extravagant architectures of mansions, beautifull=
y tended gardens, al the bric-a-brac of an already "post modern style" whic=
h mixes the native materials in the making of imitations of buildings the w=
onders have never seen except in illustrations and associate with being of =
an "Ancient Dynasty" or a Roman Republic, or Greece, England, France.  And =
in this world are the forerunners of Faulkner's characters running amok in =
feuds and violence, ignorance and dissolution.  And al of it built on slave=
ry and exploitation, in order to build a mansion that can be seen from the =
River Boats to make one think one is living in a civilization "elsewhere," =
as though in another time completely.

Life on the Mississippi is actually a great anarkeyology of appropriation, =
in every aspect of the furniture, the houses' designs, the styles adopted a=
nd created in clothing, the types of books which are in the libraries, ever=
y detail is seen as an appropriation from elsewhere, a vast fantasy world t=
rying to imitate things that it does not comprehend nor want to other than =
what it symbolizes.  And even in the midst of al the grandeur and posing, t=
here is the vision of the incipient, swift rush of decay, decomposition, th=
e first signs of the ghosts that will soon enough inhabit this fantasy worl=
d as it slides into the past, as gone as as were the previous bends in the =
ever changing course of the river.

All one has to do is study the Twain book and then move on the tomes of ima=
ges made through decades of this same world by Clarence john Laughlin--hims=
elf the owner of one of the best private libraries in America, an immense e=
ccentric assemblage of heaps and crates and shelves put togetehr by himself=
--a great admirer of Baudelaire and French poetry and prose--and there is t=
he after effects" world of Twain's--ghostly, in ruins, depopulated, haunted=
 and still the repository for this huge collection of appropriated styles a=
nd structures in their journey through time's decomposing. What Luaghlin wr=
ites of in his notes accompanying his works, is of a world which in reality=
 is already a Surreality--the fotos in which he constructs strange dreamlik=
e scenes among the already strange "real scenes"
are simply the introduction of figures and tableaux to stages that are alre=
ady crying out for actors.  since they already inhabit a "living dream,"
a living-death, the introduction of the "faked" dream scenes seems "perfect=
ly natural."

(I used a transfer of a Laughlin fotoa door in 1950's Milwaukee as part of =
a collage piece for the cover of an issue of Kaurab Poetry Journal--and "Af=
ter effect" of the ghostliness in Laughlin's fotos become more ghostly via =
its transposition as a transfer of a xeroxed copy of the copy of the photo =
included in a book of his work.)

If turning to thes particular models as examples of appropriation at work s=
eems "old fashioned," don't be fooled, their controversial nature rages on.=
  I picked up by chance the other day a new updated edition of Norman Finke=
lstein's Beyond Hutzpah--and opened as though by magic to a section which r=
eproduces pages from Twain's book on his travels to the Middle East and Eur=
ope.  The controversy that rages in these pages detailing the reproduced pa=
ges of Twain's MS is that Finkelstein demonstrates how passages from twin h=
ave been edited, slightly altered, taken a bit out of context, and used as =
evidence by Alan Dershowitz, who is also plagiarizing from a discredited te=
xt which he pretends that he is not plagiarizing from, of some passage in T=
wain regrading the "non-existence" of Palestinian peoples in certain areas =
of contemporary Israel-Palestine. Finkelstein is an excellent example of a =
researcher who goes through the long series of twists and turns of a quotat=
ion, a footnote, single word, in order to arrive at an understanding not on=
ly of what "originally or actually happened," but also, what has happened a=
long the way, in the uses of a quotation or appropriated text.  Since his a=
rgument is with a famous Harvard Law School member and lawyer, Finkelstein =
relishes the opportunity to pick apart the arguments involved, the citation=
s and texts.


On the one hand, the famous lawyer is shown to be plagiarizing from a discr=
edited text a severely altered mis- or dis-quotation from Twain, and on the=
 other, is Finkelstein's excavations of the layers of the text's palimpsest=
s, alterations, transpositions, and is being turned into a "fact"
in order to "prove" that a contemporary situation is based on "solid eviden=
ce."

What is surprising from the point of view of literary--and legal-- appropri=
ation is that a lawyer would use the uncited source of a discredited work i=
n which a quotation is found from a famous author, which can easily be chec=
ked. What has happened is that a faked version of a documentary account by =
a fiction writer is taken as being a "reality" that existed in the past whi=
ch proves the validity of the present reality.  By demonstrating the faked =
and thus fictionalized use of the documentary account to prove "reality," F=
inkelstein undercuts the present "reality" by the restoration of the origin=
al text's actual order of words and phrases and in their correct contexts.

The Twain who journeys from the Cairos and Memphises of the USA to those of=
 the "Ancient World," having detailed the appropriations of the New World i=
n al their faked glories, and hungry to see the "originals," becomes in tur=
n appropriated as a faked "glory" text himself, who is then "restored" to h=
is original state in his own words by a commentator in an argument over the=
 borders and existences of peoples both in the past and in the present whic=
h uses the past to justify itself.

In this example alone, one find some of the aspects in which appropriated t=
exts become part of arguments over literally appropriated lands, as well as=
 depictions of appropriated city names and styles of architecture and manne=
rs and reading materials which wind up being part of the future historical =
reality of the ancient places that are both  used as models  and their actu=
alities as sites visited as a tourist by the famous author of a previous
century.   The shuttling back and forth through versions of the text is
accompanied by a shuttling back in forth in time as well as a shuttling bac=
k and forth between versions of land boundaries in the present based on acc=
ounts from the past found in the text and altered only to be restored.
The text itself becomes an extention of a "space of contested possession"
not only as a text, but also in the world and in a conflict between the use=
s of the past to justify the present.

Via uncited citation, a hoaxed appropriation of a text enters into an inten=
se argument over geography and history It is this aspect of appropriation o=
f texts as actual documents in appropriations of land and history that prov=
ides the kind of destabilizing as well as destabilizing "after effects" whi=
ch make more complex  the senses of and uses of "literary appropriation."  =
As with Travel Literature, texts become the genesis for immense debates ove=
r the actual legitimacy of ownership of colonized lands and the rights of p=
eoples who essay to inhabit these lands.

Interestingly, this aspect of the "after effects" of appropriations of "lit=
erary" and "travel" texts tends to be ignored in most considerations of app=
ropriation of texts,, which tend to regard the literary appropriation as be=
ing limited to that one area, and so the more "formal" qualities of an appr=
opriation mechanism at work may be examined rather than potentialities in o=
ther areas such as geography, history, the military, legal arguments, etc.

In effect, to limit the awareness of the effects and "After effects" of tex=
ts in and as appropriation, has the peculiar and subtle effect of a removal=
 from consideration of the abilities of texts to have these effects and Aft=
er effects.  That is, one develops a sense of the use of language which has=
 no "consequences," nor, in effect, any "complicities."  This creates a sep=
aration in language, in which on one hand "transgressions in language" are =
urged, while those outside this realm are not.  And if this is to be mainta=
ined as a structure of belief and method, then the transgressions of texts =
across the limits of the text's boundaries, becomes something to in effect =
deny.  In this way, the peculiar argument can be advanced that in changing =
language via transgressing boundaries within it, one is changing the world,=
 and at the same time, that this use of language is not in any responsible =
for what is happening around it, nor that the words that it uses are just a=
s contaminated as the ones others use.

This sense of a "purifying of the language of the tribe" as advanced by Mal=
larme, is in many ways related to the ways in which propaganda functions, b=
y limiting the range of effects which are allowed to be considered, so as t=
o narrow the focus on an ever more centralized configuration and figure or =
figures of power. In a sense, it points to an elite grouping of poets or wr=
iters or artists who are as it were the guardians of this language, and so =
are deemed the ones to determine the entry or not into the canons or "accep=
table ones" of this or that artist or style, this or that version of approp=
riation as opposed to an other. Rtaher than a rhizomatic, horizontal moveme=
nt of the energies of appropriation, one finds instead a vertical axis alon=
g which are stacked the categories of hegemonies and hierarchies.

In a sense, this removes the role of the "dead author" and replaces it with=
 a kind of deity, a philopsher-poet-king-queen in a sense, of an aristocrac=
y of the word.

Yet as the example of the traveling through times and spaces and altered an=
d restored versions of Twain's text shows, the appropriation of texts and o=
bjects opens the arenas of action and makes for the dispersal across the un=
expected of the ever uncertain findings and uses of words, and of the exist=
ences of "authors," not at all as fixed identities, but as ever changing "s=
ources," and "citations" which "crop up in the oddest of places."

Texts and authors in this senses live lives of their own, which are outside=
 the conventions of what are thought to be the boundaries of texts and auth=
orship.  That this proliferation and dispersal of texts and authors among a=
l manner of terrains and times may turn up in situations with which "litera=
ture" so to speak would like to "disconnected from", this is because of the=
 "troubling" non-possession of words and texts which copy right and intelle=
ctual property laws continually try to keep pace with.  The borders which l=
iterature would like to keep sealed for itself, or art, or any other form w=
hich has created a language it regards as its own and its own only--these b=
orders appropriation shows not to be as secure as one would have thought, a=
nd so the desire for kind of "homeland security"system to control this "ter=
rorism of words" against the very Terror in a sense which would dominate th=
em.  This is the sense in which the areas of language in literature begin t=
o become a part of the operations of aspects of propaganda, in that the des=
ire and need to control and maintain power supersedes the "love of language=
" and begins to see that the means to in effect "torture" language are "jus=
tified by the ends."

Again, one finds "travel literature" as a form of the contesting of borders=
, not only among settlers and already local populations in the New and Old =
Worlds, but also the borders among texts as "faked," "documentary evidences=
," "depictions of fakes as being a reality," and the use of fakes to assert=
 a present reality based on an altered one via an altered text.
The ebb and flow of the fake, the real, the fictional, the literary and the=
 actual landscapes involved in terms of borders and possessions--as well as=
 "battles for the very soul of the people and land"--al these are bound up =
with the uses made of appropriation through a great many levels within just=
 one small dis-quoted quotation from a text by an author who himself depict=
ed so much use of appropriation as a manner of constructing the fantasy lan=
d reality he witnessed in its heights and the first signs of its rapid deca=
y and decomposition.

Even the current dramas of the American-Israeli interrelationships are depi=
cted in this using of an American text as a "witness" to be argued with in =
a "case" for or against a version of history that is contested.

The travel aspect of uses of appropriation is one that begins to change in =
the 19th century, with the ability to import ever greater amounts of goods =
from every farther distant and more "exotic" arts of the world, as well as =
those "exotics" which exist close to hand.  (The Surrealists' Flea market, =
Joseph Cornell's garage full of old magazines and found matrials from thrif=
t stores, etc, Schwitter's use of street found debris--and the one found by=
 Dubuffet in his concept of Art Brut.)

In Baudelaire, the continual theme of "le Voyage" needs no distant places t=
o go--it can be a journey through his mistress' hair, or through a grubby a=
lley--or to a hashish smoking session.  Later, Huysman's character Des Esse=
intes in A Rebours Against the Grain is the Engllish title) simply goes to =
an English pub as it exits in its exact state for the use of Englishmen in =
Paris, rtaher than having to bore himself with the tedium expense and time =
of a trip to the actual England.  Travel becomes the voyage of reverie, dre=
am, released by contact with talismanic objects, odors, colors, sounds and =
images, texts which are from the place or about the place to which one woul=
d like to go.

"To shut the eyes is travel" says Emily Dickinson, who wrote of books as sh=
ips with which to travel.

In this sense, to me, the Yasusada works and Yasusada's idea of writing an =
"After Spicer" in honor of  Spicer's "After Lorca" functions itself as a tr=
avel literature example, in that using the construction which is made use o=
f by the hoxed imitations of scholarship of "real texts by real authors,"
in creating a series of fictional and pseudonymous authors, editors, transl=
ators, footnoters, annotators, as well as quotations which are real and fic=
tional or faked, to  construct both a fictional author and his fictional wo=
rks, as well the journey to a distant and exotic land--a Japan which is not=
 Japan but an "After Japan," not a translation or copy, nor actual document=
s, but an imaginary constructed out of the elements of these . via both act=
ual and fictional Japanese poets, artists, places and events.
After all, what is Spicer's Lorca's Spain?  Or his Spanish language?  Where=
 are they existing in Spicer's text?  The traveling with Lorca that Spicer =
indicates is done in the home of Spicer's, as of two lovers living togetehr=
 for a season.  It is in a sense of the continuation of the voyage of Baude=
laire through his mistress' hair as a voyage-to-a-text, as well as that voy=
age of Poe,s in which the white ghostly spaces left by the vanished ghost o=
f the lover-- "After" effects, so that work is written both "After" Lorca l=
iterarily and" literally"--after Lorca the lover of the summer in autumn ha=
s departed.  And indeed, the introductory letter opening the text is writte=
n by Lorca--the already dead poet speaking from beyond the grave as his own=
 ghostly After effects become ghost-written by Spicer as his "After Lorca."

For Poe, the "Aftereffects' are "mournful and never ending remembrance"
which also tries continually to be reanimated from out of the coffin--into =
a state between life and death, dream and waking--in which al things possib=
le may occur--an open area of uncertainty--where Poe and Pym takes turns au=
thoring the same text, each one vanishing as the other reappears, back from=
 the supposedly dead, to assert his rightful place in place of the one livi=
ng and writing in his absence.  To battle with the double of oneself--in th=
is suspended state--the tale of "William Wilson"--Rimbaud and his "I is an =
other"--the confrontation with the hoaxy aspects as well as the documentary=
 and imaginary--of writing and of what is an author--not a who--but a what-=
-as though the author really matters--when as Poe asserts in the "Philosoph=
y of Composition" --one begins with determining what the effect is that one=
 would like to produce.

In other words, an "after effect" which precedes its own creation--just as =
the "Philosophy of Composition" is written AFTER the composition of "The Ra=
ven" and so re-tells the "story" of its creation as an "after-thought" as w=
ell as an After-effect----which "reconstructs" an event which actually did =
not happen, in order to make an argument for the kind of Composition Poe is=
 propounding as the one best suited to create the kind of "great effects on=
 an audience" that the "Raven" had.  By demonstrating that he worked backwa=
rds, deductively and rationally to produce what are the "irrational"
yet also "mechanically engineered" effects of the poem and its Raven repeat=
edly & (a robot Raven, an "synthetic intelligence"--?) mechanically"quothin=
g""Nevermore"--Poe writes "after the fact" the non history of a poem in ord=
er to prove that his "irrationality" as person does not exist, nor does it =
in the poem, but al of it, all of it--can be explained!

In the very act of essaying to be the ultra rational one, Poe begins to sou=
nd not unlike one of his irrational characters in the process of trying to =
defend their actions, which came from that other source he depicts so vivid=
ly in a different piece, "The Imp of the Perverse."

As a writer, Poe is experiencing and detailing not the "death of the author=
"--but the cracking, corroding, collapsing, dispersal and disappearance-rea=
ppearance dead-alive, living dead,suspended animation state of an author in=
 which the uncertainty principle is at work. so that the author is beginnin=
g to have trouble distinguishing between himself and his invented authors, =
his characters,his texts, his hoaxes and documentations, his published "mar=
ginalia" which appear in Newspapers as "real" and which are "made up" as he=
 owned no library to annotate, but only about three books at the time.

And how does Poe exist today?  He stil exists as after effects in America a=
s the the creation of a poison pen obituary written by Rufus Griswold! The =
source for good deal of the myths of Poe is this outright piece of slander.
Poe himself became a part of long running tabloid sensationalism, both addi=
ng to and altering, shifting, his status as a writer hovering ever suspende=
d among a series of faked images and stories about himself, and his own suc=
h creations.  In this sense Poe has realized in a peculiar way one aspect o=
f his dream of existing among the living-dead, as he himself continues to e=
xist as this mixture of urban legend, movie versions, illustrations, endles=
s repackagings of his works, endless new theories about them, endless new d=
iscoveries not only of original editions themselves but also of the actual =
facts which he did make use of and which had been thought to be his own hoa=
xes.

In a sense, to understand a genealogy of "post modern" examples of appropri=
ation, is to find Burroughs' impossible glossary of wrods whose intention a=
re fugitive--for the moment one were to define, control, st boundaries and =
divide into categories, classifications, the very thing one is observing in=
 order to do this, would continually be breaking it asunder, decomposing it=
, rearranging it--and so, the place to "begin" is in actuality in the daily=
 newspapers or news in any media--as there one finds the continual dispersa=
l of writings and writers evidenced in the symptoms of language which are r=
egistering the seismographic chartings of voyages which never cease traveli=
ng, never cease their production of effects and After effects, fall out, ra=
dioactive dusts--mutations and permutations--ghosts and ghost written texts=
--

The "Purloined Letter(s)" found hidden in plain site/sight/cite all around
one--
the War which was founded on forged texts and paintings of non existent fot=
os--the widespread use of "election fraud" as a technique both to count vot=
ing and to frighten off voting-- the uses of torture to produce "confession=
s" which are false or real or who knows what--but which are none the less u=
sed as "proofs"--even though the actual confession may never be revealed-- =
the persons detained without any accusations-- that is, the non-writings of=
 non texts which condemn persons non accused to be detained indefinitely-- =
the ways in which a society inoculates itself by the alteration and vanishi=
ng of words from what it does not want to or like to or is not meant to hea=
r or read-- the uses of appropriation are everywhere one around-- perhaps w=
hat is really the purpose is to find the ways in which these are all interr=
elated and so constitute the existence of culture as it is presenting itsel=
f to itself through its appropriated and faked and hoaxed uses of words and=
 images- rather than a typology in which the separations are made so as to =
exclude one domain from another--and so to deny or deliberately or not miss=
 the effects and After effects of all the various means and meanings of
appropriation--

This particular study of my own i call "The New Extreme Experimental Americ=
an Poetry and Arts"-- this interrealtionship of aspects across, among, thro=
ugh and around appropriation in constructing a language which essays to den=
y what it is capble of and is in many instances doing daily, as a matter of=
 routine-- a language which allows persons the appearnces of freedom when i=
n fact tightening and contsraining ever more tightly and narrowly the range=
s of awareness and questioinng- and at the same time to find the actions an=
d uses of appropriation which decompose this massive compostion one is pres=
ented with as a reality which in fact is but a continaully tweaked construc=
tion in which language used by all is participating daily-- to study the co=
mposition and to find the decompositions-- as much as possible, though one =
oneself is pitifully limited--

Wednesday that Whitman would adore what Obama stands for and highly =

Just for fun, my 11th grade, gifted English class is making Walt Whitman =
videos.  I decided to make my own "series" - The New Adventures of Walt =
Whitman!

The first three episodes are up now with three more to come this week.

http://www.youtube.com/user/n8pritts

Check them out!  & if you happen to have any favorite Whitman lines - =
from Song of Myself or elsewhere - send them to me & maybe we'll do =
those next!

1. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck. Feel free =
to label me, so long as it's an accurate label. If by neo-liberal you mean =
a new kind of classical liberal that supports free markets, science, consti=
tutional democratic government, and social liberty, then I am happily and p=
roudly a neo-liberal.=0A=0A2. "spouting off talking points" is something po=
liticians and demagogues do and for which I have no respect at all. It has =
nothing to do with women. If I had wanted to be sexist, I would have chosen=
 the term "hysterical." I think we both know enough etymology to understand=
 my clear intent there. The two examples you gave would have been appropria=
te had I used "hysterical" rather than "screeched," as each are a clear, un=
ambiguous reference to African-American history.  Also, I did, twice, ackno=
wledge that you did engage the issues, and you have, twice ignored the fact=
 that I have done so.=0A=0AOn the marriage issue: 70% of African-Americans =
voted against Prop 8; 65% of Hispanics voted against it.; 49% of whites vot=
ed against it. That's not scapegoating. Those are hard numbers. Again, you =
are implying racism here, which is only intended to shut down argument -- n=
ot to mention ridiculous, as my wife is Mexican-American. =0A=0AI agree wit=
h point 2, which is why I am generally against democracy as practiced by Ca=
lifornia. I believe in a constitutional democratic republic, which is under=
mined by such things as the pure democracy demonstrated by CA on Prop. 8. =
=0A=0AThe reason for the dissonance between the vote for Obama and the vote=
 against Prop. 8 is that if you were to poll African-Americans and Hispanic=
s on the issues, they don't actually support the things supported by the De=
mocratic Party on things ranging from gay rights and abortion to school vou=
chers and basic economic issues. Both groups also tend to be pro-military. =
So why do they vote Democrat when ideologically they are Republicans? The D=
emocratic Party has done a brilliant job of convincing them that the GOP is=
 vaguely "against" them -- and nobody bothers to look up the fact that the =
Civil Rights Bill of 1964 was voted for 65% by Republicans, but only 55% by=
 Democrats. Should the GOP ever figure out how to overcome the DNC rhetoric=
, I'm afraid that things like Prop. 8 are going to become much more common.=

5 PM=0A=0AI will only quickly note that this is the kind of argument I was =
merely asking=0Afor, and that it is quite different in tone from the other =
posting -- though I=0Awill criticize you on the fact that if mine was conde=

screeching, etc. in a sexist=0Afashion. Another all-too-typical liberal tac=
tic: to shut down arguments with=0Aaccusations of racism, sexism, etc. rath=
er than engaging the issues. My=0Aexperience is that too many liberals are =
screechers, regardless of sex. If you=0Achoose to take offense at my remark=
s, remember that it is you who are choosing=0Ato take offense -- there is n=
othing inherently offensive in what I wrote.=0AFinally, a good idea is a go=

arx's is pure evil -- but when he has a good idea,=0Ahe has a good idea. Do=
n't disregard Sun Tzu just=0Abecause he was an aristocrat -- he was an aris=

ing him because he was Chinese,=0Asomething I'm certain is absurd). =0A=0AT=
hat having been said, I do take several of your points. The civil rights=0A=
arguments are an excellent approach. Having been raised a Baptist in Kentuc=
ky,=0Aand being now married to an Hispanic, I think I have some expertise i=
n the=0Aareas=0Aof which I speak. My experience is that religious people ra=
ther claim that=0Ahomosexuality is "unnatural." This is quickly undermined =
by the=0Aaforementioned examples, which puts them in a tight rhetorical spo=
t, as they=0Anow=0Ahave to regroup and argue that "well, we're not animals.=
 We're=0Asupposed to be better." I typically then direct them to their prev=
ious=0Aargument. If they claim it's a mater of choice, I can and have prove=
n=0Aotherwise. Having demonstrated the incoherence of their argument, they =
have=0Atypically then been more receptive to other arguments regarding civi=
l rights,=0Aetc. The real issue for many religious people, I think, is less=
 that the=0Agovernment "recognize" gay marriage than that they have a fear =
that=0Athe government=0Awill turn around and force their church to perform =
gay marriage ceremonies.=0AThere have been several cases of churches being =
forced by law to hire someone=0Awhose lifestyle they did not approve of, so=
 their fears are not entirely=0Aunfounded. It seems to me, then, that if we=
 are going to win this argument, we=0Ahave to figure out a way to assuage t=
hose concerns. And if we are truly=0Abelievers in a separation of church an=
d state, we cannot use the state to force=0Athe churches to accept our worl=
d view. That should, in fact, require persuasion=0Arather than laws. One co=
uld also point out to fundamentalists that there is=0Amuch=0Aprohibited by =
the Bible we do not bother with, so why are we picking and=0Achoosing? I re=

and allow them to use that bible as the foundation of this=0Aargument (reca=

meter is correct at all, as I imagine you know -- it is a matter of rights=
=0A*for everyone* despite and including our differences, even moral ones, a=
s=0Aacknowledged by separation of church and state.=0A=0A2.  My calling the=

t debating its existence as one of nature v.=0Anurture=0Ato determine who g=

 to -- that of arguing the very existence of=0Ahomosexuality as "proven" by=
 its existence in nature.  Who cares? =0A(That's a rhetorical one, Troy.  I=
 know who cares.)  The point is that you=0Aargue a biological basis for hom=
osexuality as evidenced in the behavior of=0Aanimals.  Religious folks will=
 argue in return that we aren't animals and=0Ashouldn't be gay just because=
 they might be by some freak of nature.  (Plus=0Athey like to take being ga=

 proposition).  =0A=0AWhy resort to such tactics?  Just because they do?  J=

 merit for seeking rights=0Aas=0Apeople who are different than them -- desp=

e (despite "corrective"=0Ameasures - http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/maga=

titutionalized bias. =0ADevolving into the archaic debate of just what peni=

 races were two different=0Aspecies (see anti-miscegenation laws).  It wasn=

the passing of Prop 8 speaks moreover to the hope that by=0Adenying the GLB=

 that community -- at least, that's my pessimistic read on the=0Awhole deba=

 =0A=0A=0AMark, =0A=0ASeparations of symbols vs. legalities not withstandin=

If=0A"civil unions" were to be federally-mandated, then perhaps that would=
=0Acover the legal protections that marriages do, but until then:=0A=0A=0AW=
hat are some of the limitations of civil unions?=0A=0A    =0A=0A    Civil u=
nions are different from marriage, and that difference has=0A    wide-rangi=
ng implications that make the two institutions unequal. Here=0A    is a qui=
ck look at some of the most significant differences: =0A=0A    =0A=0A    -P=
ortability:=0A=0A    =0A=0A    Marriages are respected state to state for a=
ll purposes, but questions=0A    remain about how civil unions will be trea=
ted in other states. =0A    GLAD=0A    believes there are strong arguments =
that civil unions deserve respect=0A    across the country just like marria=
ges. But the two appellate courts=0A    that have addressed the issue (in C=
onnecticut and Georgia) have=0A    disrespected them based on the fact that=
 their states do not grant civil=0Aunions themselves.=0A=0A    =0A=0A    -E=
nding a Civil Union:=0A=0A    =0A=0A    If you are married, you can get div=
orced in any state in which you are a=0A    resident. But if states continu=
e to disrespect civil unions, there is=0A    no way to end the relationship=
 other than by establishing residency in=0A    Vermont and filing for divor=
ce there. This has already created problems=0A    for some couples who now =
have no way to terminate their legal=0A    commitment.=0A=0A    =0A=0A    -=
Federal Benefits:=0A=0A    =0A=0A    According to a 1997 GAO report, civil =
marriage brings with it at least=0A    1,049 legal protections and responsi=
bilities from the federal=0A    government, including the right to take lea=
ve from work to care for a=0A    family member, the right to sponsor a spou=
se for immigration purposes,=0A    and Social Security survivor benefits th=
at can make a difference between=0A    old age in poverty and old age in se=
curity. Civil unions bring none of=0A    these critical legal protections.=
=0A=0A    =0A=0A    -Taxes & Public Benefits for the Family:=0A=0A    =0A=
=0A    Because the federal government does not respect civil unions, a coup=
le=0A    with a civil union will be in a kind of limbo with regard to=0A   =
 governmental functions performed by both state and federal governments,=0A=
    such as taxation, pension protections, provision of insurance for=0A   =
 families, and means-tested programs like Medicaid. Even when states try=0A=
    to provide legal protections, they may be foreclosed from doing so in=
=0A    joint federal/state programs.=0A=0A    =0A=0A    -Filling out forms:=
=0A=0A    =0A=0A    Every day, we fill out forms that ask us whether we are=
 married or=0A    single. People joined in a civil union don't fit into eit=
her category.=0A    People with civil unions should be able to identify the=
mselves as a=0A    single family unit, but misrepresenting oneself on offic=
ial documents=0A    can be considered fraud and carries potential serious c=
riminal=0A=0A    penalties. =0A=0A    =0A=0A    -Separate & Unequal -- Seco=
nd-Class Status:=0A=0A    =0A=0A    Even if there were no substantive diffe=
rences in the way the law treated=0A    marriages and civil unions, the fac=
t that a civil union remains a=0A    separate status just for gay people re=
presents real and powerful=0A    inequality. We've been down this road befo=
re in this country and should=0A    not kid ourselves that a separate insti=
tution just for gay people is a=0A    just solution here either. Our consti=
tution requires legal equality for=0A    all. Including gay and lesbian cou=
ples within existing marriage laws is=0A    the fairest and simplest thing =
to do.=0A=0A    =0A=0A    How real are these differences between marriage a=
nd civil unions, given=0A    that a federal law and some state laws discrim=
inate against all=0A    marriages of same-sex couples?=0A=0A    =0A=0A    W=
ould any of this change immediately with marriage of same-sex couples?=0A  =
  Probably not, because married same-sex couples will face other layers of=
=0A    discrimination against their marriages. Right now, a federal law den=
ies=0A    recognition of same-sex unions conferred by any state for purpose=
s of=0A    all federal programs and requirements and over 30 state laws do =
the=0A    same. Ending discrimination in marriage does not mean the end of =
all=0A    discrimination, but using the term "marriage" rather than=0A"civi=
l union"=0A    is an essential first step to opening the door and addressin=
g whether=0A    continued governmental discrimination against civil marriag=
es of gay and=0A    lesbian people makes sense. =0A=0A    =0A=0A    Marriag=
e and civil unions remain different, both in practice and in=0A=0A    princ=
iple. =0A=0A    =0A=0A    First, more than a dozen states have not taken a =
discriminatory position=0A    against civil marriages of gay and lesbian co=
uples. In those states,=0A    civilly married gay and lesbian couples shoul=
d be able to live and=0A    travel freely and without fear that their relat=
ionship will be=0A    disrespected.=0A=0A    =0A=0A    Second, even as to t=
hose states with discriminatory laws, legally=0A    married gay and lesbian=
 couples from those states may well face some=0A    discrimination in some =
quarters, but their marriages will also be=0A    treated with legal respect=
 in other arenas. Marriages are far more=0A    likely to be respected by ot=
hers than newly minted "civil=0Aunions."=0A=0A    =0A=0A    Using the term =
marriage also prompts a discussion about fairness.=0A    Allowing same sex =
couples to marry (rather than enter a separate status)=0A    will allow gay=
 and lesbian people to talk with their neighbors, their=0A    local elected=
 officials, and the Congress about whether discrimination=0A    against the=
ir marriages is fair. Where gay and lesbian people and their=0A    children=
 are part of the social fabric, is it right to continue=0A    discriminatin=
g against them in civil marriage? The federal government=0A    and states t=
hat have taken discriminatory positions against marriages of=0A    gay and =
lesbian couples could rethink those policies and go back to=0A    respectin=
g state laws about marriage, as they have done for hundreds of=0A    years.=
 In the end, we will not be able to have this discussion until=0A    gay an=
d lesbian folks have what everyone else=0A    has: civil marriage.=0A=0A   =

Out of the turmoil emerges one emblem, an engraving =E2=80=94
a young Negro at dawn in straw hat and overalls,
an emblem of impossible prophecy, a crowd
dividing like the furrow which a mule has ploughed,
parting for their president: a field of snow-flecked cotton
forty acres wide, of crows with predictable omens
that the young ploughman ignores for his unforgotten
cotton-haired ancestors, while lined on one branch, is a tense
court of bespectacled owls and, on the field's receding rim =E2=80=94
a gesticulating scarecrow stamping with rage at him.
The small plough continues on this lined page
beyond the moaning ground, the lynching tree, the tornado's
black vengeance,
and the young ploughman feels the change in his veins,
heart, muscles, tendons,
till the land lies open like a flag as dawn's sure
light streaks the field and furrows wait for the sower

dear tisa, thanks.  the point for me is not really whether obama is black
enough or where his roots are (though i've talked about that, it's been to
try and point out how outside working class experience he is, not how
black or non-black he is).  it's more where his allegiances lie, what he
has had to do and say to win this presidency and how this will affect what
he can do in the future.  someone said, i think about the money he's had
to raise to win this election, that we can rejoice in his winning, but the
system is not about to change--the system which forced him to rely on
corporate support and to bow to AIPAC.  and like bill clinton, there are
those the ruling elites pick up and out, educate them to join them.
instead of bringing in universal healthcare, the clintons turned right
around and gave us NAFTA.  but we want to believe and are more likely to
be hoodwinked by someone we love than someone as easy to hate as george w.
bush.  both carter and clinton were murderous to hundreds of thousands of
people while in office.  that's the system.  i'm sad.  gabe

Well, no.
The Conservatives in Canada are still to the left of the Democrats in
the USA.

You have to say yes, there have been good words coming from parts of
the western world for the post-election USA.
But we have to remember that in most of the western world Barrack
Obama would be to the right of centre.

Refreshments will be served

Join us!


Joan Larkin's My Body: New and Selected Poems received the
Publishing Triangle's 2008 Audre Lorde Award.  David Ulin of
the Los Angeles Times has called Larkin's voice "unsentimental,
ruthless and clear-eyed=85.  This is poetry without pity, in which
despair leads not to degradation but to a kind of grace."  Her
previous books include Housework, A Long Sound, Sor Juana's
Love Poems (translated with Jaime Manrique), and Cold River,
winner of a Lambda Award.  Larkin co-founded Out & Out Books
during the feminist literary explosion of the seventies and co-
edited the groundbreaking anthologies Amazon Poetry and Lesbian
Poetry with Elly Bulkin and Gay and Lesbian Poetry in Our Time
with Carl Morse.  Her collection A Woman Like That was nominated
for Publishing Triangle and Lambda nonfiction prizes in 2000.
Larkin teaches in Drew University's low-residency MFA program
in Poetry and Poetry in Translation and will be Wichita State
University's Spring '09 Visiting Poet.


Sandy Florian is the author of Telescope (Action Books, 2006),
32 Pedals & 47 Stops (Tarpaulin Sky Press, 2007), The Tree of No
(Action Books, 2008), and Of Wonderland & Waste (the launching Sidebrow
Press, 2009).  She lives and works in San Francisco.

Subject:      The What-If
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

(written under zero sleep, apologies, but there's 'something here')



The What-If


http://www.alansondheim.org/ layout jpgs

The last theoretical, what to do when exhausted to
the point of trembling or shuddering, unchecked for
reason, false grammar, confusion:

Vaihinger and Bentham both developed the concept of fictions or the as-if
in relation to the real: as if the perceived real were real, as if reifi-
cation were the state of things - as if the real were within the simile
and subjunctive.

The what-if simultaneously doubles and reduces the as-if: Doubles, since
it proposes an alternative branching or possible world which is an as-if
within the as-if of th real - and reduces, since a fictionalized as-if
(that is, the as-if as fiction) branched into the aegis of a dominant
fiction no longer subjunctive - the what-if as production or temporal
process creates a fiction without split - no longer 'as-if X were real
within a perceived world that is necessarily split,' but an X which is all
the real there is within a generated world or simulacrum.

The what-if simultaneously quadruples and collapses: Quadruples, since the
epistemology splits and what is real has also divided - and collapses,
since the fiction is ontologically degree-zero; one might also approach
this in terms of codes and replaced or augmented codes, or replaced or
augmented scripts or objects, therefore basic operations of annihilation,
creation, displacement, condensation, substitution, branching and
collapse.

The what-if does nothing and everything: Nothing, since ontology remains
as before, and the model - for that is what we are introducing - utilizes
the same fundamental rues, protocols, codes, and principles - and every-
thing, since what occurs is the construct of a new universe, related to
the old, but with a modification, however small.

The what-if places the world within which an enunciation is made, within
the subjunctive; it is always a time-dependent process.

Any real or virtual movement within real or virtual worlds is a time-
dependent process. But what-if is a movement with a diacritical mark or
curlicue.

The mark need not be within the real or virtual world; it may be within
the world of the spectator.

From the outside, a change is created within the gamespace. The rules
within the gamespace are the same as before.

A change is made from without to within. A demarcation occurs, a
separation of the gamespace into before and after.

Gamespace is always already before and after; the separation occurs on a
meta-level.

The separation is semiotic and the construction of a semiotic.

The separation is a figure of speech.

There is speaking within and speaking without; a model might insist on
these distinctions: go from real through virtual through channel through
virtual through real.

Of course what is real is virtual and what is virtual is real. Of course
the channel is simultaneously real and virtual; one might argue that the
channel is the diacritical mark, the demarcation itself.

The demarcation may be fuzzy. The change from X to X' may be sufficiently
complex as to prohibit or occlude a transformation. A transformation may
occur - the result of a what-if process - without being noticed; there may
be no notification or a misplaced or misrecognized notification.

So what-if implies an impending modification within a sememe from without;
it splits from itself, constructs on a meta-level, a semiotic which breaks
through and within the discursive. The transformation within the real
virtual, from X to X' is always already sutured; the break, again, occurs
within the subject hirself outside of, or constructing an outside-of, the
gamespace.

Needless to say the what-if may be nothing more than conversational, i.e.
what if the sky were green? It may or may not result in a process applied
from without to an ostensible subject. The ostensible subject, gamespace,
world, etc. may appear, from without, broken or of interest or anomalous
or cohering or 'the same as before' within the epistemological limits of
whatever transformations are already going on. The ostensible subject is
the subject of the subject applying the what-if, that is, the external
subject, placed as well, reflexively perhaps, within the subjunctive.
Whether or not anything is 'really' carried out.

The what-if, then; is always already a thought-experiment as well, no
matter what happens later or what happens reflexively, or even within the
case where nothing happens at all.

One might say that the human project implies thrownness into and through-
out the what-if on a continuous basis, that everything and nothing is
happening, that this happening is a model for human existence and
behavior.

And in this light, a model perhaps of every organic existence and behavior
- but one might well ask if all organisms are capable of the subjunctive
in the sense used here? I would say no, that the subjunctive implies
something which, if not uniquely human, at least implies an intelligence
organized according to a just-so, which is rarely found otherwise in the
world.

Roughly, it has to do with stewardship and dominion as well, placing the
world we witness, real or virtual or worlding, under the subjunctive: to
be human is to live within the semiotic of the subjunctive.

And here, within a specified virtual world, one carries out experiments
telling or foretelling, floundered and foundered on the subjunctive - this
these experiments might be taken as fundamental as well to any human
project, if such there be. Perhaps this virtual world lacks a sense of,
lacks the catastrophic; perhaps it is this lack which permits the what-if
a discursive and reified operation. Perhaps, only just at our moment and
in this configuration, perhaps nothing more.

I like this quote. It rings 'the bell' for me with the very recent experien=
ce of 'witnessing' the current show of Marin Puryear at SFMOMA. His sculptu=
re - all in multiple kinds of wood - is constantly in search of a kind of a=
 container, the extraordinary shapes of which often go to a maximum point o=
f tension between expression and repression. Without being obviously refere=
ntial the shapes hint at diverse cultural sources (tribal, Arab, Puritan, e=
tc.) on the edge of collision. My literary connection with the work would b=
e the metaphysical conceit, say as of John Donne, "the violent yoking toget=
her of opposites" into a whole. Astonishing stuff.=A0 (Off the cuff, in a d=
ifferent manner, I would say Ornette Colman has been another master of wres=
tling together global strands of music, also employing the humor you can al=
so find in Puryear's work.=20

Frankly, it's way to early, contextually and otherwise to predict how Obama=
 - as much as he can - will "sculpt" this Presidency in relationship to the=
 rest us, including the entire globe.=A0 (Pray he not be a total "House Dem=
ocrat."!)=A0 In terms of race in this country the transition is monumental =
- maybe not as monumetal as electing a Native American!=A0 Or a Palestinian=
 as Prime Minister of Israel.=A0 To think just fifty years ago and less, Bu=
ll Connor was sicking dogs on 'Negro' demonstrators, children at that, in B=
irmingham, and we were practically begging President Kennedy to Federally i=
ntervene (let alone a practically infinite list of other racial atrocities)=
.=A0 Not that all of this stuff will eradicated instantly, or anytime soon.=
=A0 But the election of Obama has released a major piece of hope and joy. H=
ow this country's deeply fragmented whole proceeds is the new adventure.

I think young people have an easier time living in a world without
such essentialist ideas of racial identity. A biracial cousin of my
husband's (he's white) used to say that she was two-tone in high
school. When I was giving the PSATs to a group of 10th graders in the
bay area, a number of kids said "I'm mixed, what do I put," when
forced to choose between African-American and White. While the school
I teach at is at times very racially divided, at other times the
boundaries between categories seem fluid.

I would have to disagree with you, George. I would say that the Canadian
government is slightly to the right of the Democrats but this is because of
the minority status. With Harper being Bush's sidekick and with Harper
exercising rigid control over the Conservative Party, I'd say that Harper
would like the Conservative Party to be as right-wing as the Republicans -
and he will do so if he ever gets a majority which, blessedly, this time
around was prevented through the wisdom of Canadian voters.

Well, no.
The Conservatives in Canada are still to the left of the Democrats in
the USA.

You have to say yes, there have been good words coming from parts of
the western world for the post-election USA.
But we have to remember that in most of the western world Barrack
Obama would be to the right of centre.

& so it goes... how much change is possible within the 2 party system? Especially in the States where both parties have the deepest pockets, open to all bidders.

It looks to me like David Chirot's address book has been hacked into and e-=
mails are being sent to his contacts purporting to be from him, stranded in=
 Africa and in desperate need of money to be immediately wired. Needless to=
 say, this is the latest advancement of the Nigerian scams... So if you get=
 that e-mail, be warned.

(i sent this yesterday but the delivery system says something abt delivery =
failure so trying again--in the meantime i learned James already back in Ir=
eland for his resting place--)


Many thanks for posting this Stephen=2C especially as it has news of days i=
n SF. =20



I found your note just as about to post foto of James at blog and other pla=
ces--Kent Johnson wrote me very early in morning James was gone.


      Actually James had a poem about Silliman=2C but would be indiscreet t=
o quote it!

I made a tribute at my blog with a poem and foto and some other things--Spi=
cer--and a dedication from James-(in which he calls me the "son of God"--th=
ankfully not the Son!---but have much more to unearth--in his own hand--poe=
ms and notes--
James died on Tuesday and is in Ireland already--to be buried there--but th=
ere will the this Tuesday i beleive also a funeral as it were here in Milwa=
ukee--



i have been thinking much of his companion Jim Chapson=2C his long time com=
panion=2C also=2C himself a very fine poet--
http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com/2008/11/james-liddy-1934-2008-for-j=
im-chapson.html


James was a great inspiring legendary figure in Milwaukee=2C holding court =
at Axel's and traveling about the city to readings and events accompanied b=
y his young admirers poetic and otherwise.  He was one of the rare persons =
with whom one could discuss Jack Spicer=2C Duncan=2C so many others--and al=
so Burroughs=2C Kerouac=2C the Beats--







and then drink it in as he let flow the full flood of his Irish heritage in=
 poesy and song--
He had one of the keenest rapier wits=2C a master of the annihilating epigr=
am--improvised--
on the spot--shot with deadly aim--







He was an erotic poet=2C a gay poet=2C a queen=2C a ruminator on matter rel=
igious that turned sexual--


In person and poetry=2C the moods and ideas shift rapidly--lep and
flow-jump like bubbles in beer--as the series of topics and moods wil
be quickly by turn swwet=2C soft=2C coy=2C catty=2C caricatural=2C historic=
al=2C
rhetorical=2C pedagogical=2C blasphemous=2C thick with airy allusions=2C
paaionte with rage or laughter and grief=2C and just as much=2C celbrating
a giddy shallowness of surface=2C a delight in a knd of vernishing of a
corrupted veneer--or=2C indeed=2C from time to time=2C of a genuine verneer=
--



The heroic and humorous are ever close to hand=2C and as ever=2C the
sexual and erotic=2C the strange possibilities of a language
simultaneously religious and deeply=2C almost obscenely
blasphemous--which makes its own form of personal sacred--



Whatever room or outdoors he walked into=2C he warmed it with his
presence=2C bringing with him a glow of energy=2C humor and a sense of
poetry as both the memorializer and creator of Mythic Events.   A small
exchange of an evening of fading light among the bare spring
trees-walking along--would become transposed into a scene presented
later with the beauty =2C comedy=2C tragedy--of Myth=2C the kinds of Myth o=
ut
of Joyce and Yeats--




James was inspiring because he'd come to America out of a deep love
of jack Spicer--and had to see where Spicer had lived=2C know the people
he had known--in as many ways as possible--to be sure--the Biblical
knowing and conversational--archeological--poetical--freindships--letters--



It hadn't mattered to him that Spicer had died a few years
earlier--he told me he fully expected the presence of Spicer to be
there=2C  completely alive--and that the traces and ghosts of him --would
be found walking about=2C or at a bar--beside a radio--not dead at all--



The idea of a pilgrimage directly into what remained of the poet's
life --in the persons of his friends=2C--in the sites still extant in
which he moved--al this was a sign to others of the making of the
impossible the reality of one's life--the contact with a dead poet
turning one's life around--a pivot of the hip swinging one round the
corner of the bar-into the arms of a different future--




and so straddling worlds--from Ireland to SF to Milwaukee--and
other realms which he would hear the voices and musics of--and the
scenes appearing out of history=2C memory=2C speech--

he would
present one continually with poetry as the very life within the blood
of one's existence=2C the air one breathed and the ground one walked--




he also kept one sane=2C i believe--in so many ways--i know he often
did so for me=2C as his outrageous punning and  digressions=2C asides=2C
comments=2C passing back and forth of scribbled notes on scraps of paper
during readings with one--kept alive the spirit of the lunacy of
language in the midst of so much humorlessness--dread tedium--



i recall the huge festival at the Irish Cultural Center when he was
given an award i can't recall the name of=2C it has to do with the
presentation of one's place in a kind of throne like chair--a very high
cultural honor--and bands from Ireland were there=2C and some films--and
dancers--and unlimited free Guinness=2C tons of food--and James walking
about quietly stunned--or holding court--by turns--




and other times with George Stanley visiting--gathered in the
German bar--around a huge table--and people passing poems about and
talking--telling tales--and sharing poems=2C and some being written right
there on the spot--




James lived being a poet as a form of rebellious royalty--an
appealing charm of the punk gutter commingling itself with a sense of
aristocracy--like Johnny Rotten/Lydon saying he had copied his stage
act from Olivier's manic jeering=2C ironic and sneering portrayal of
Shakespeare's Richard the Third as he had seen it in the film version--




so indeed if one juxtaposes them--it is so!--films of Olivier and
Johnny--bobbing and screaming=2C eyes pinwheeled into the stare of
amphetamine eyes--yet al done by nervous energy alone--sheer force of
manic=2C crazed will--




James embodied these disparate energies an played them like a
fiddle=2C creating different dances in quick succession=2C thrusting and
parrying with his self mocking laughter as though a shadow that had
gotten out of line with the music--fought back with the admonishing
self that claimed to be in time with it--




rebelling against the monarch who was trying to establish his
reign--and here came the outrageous upstarts--James and his
sidekicks--to throw out the very king that he himself had been a moment
before--

or standing before an audience and reciting his own and
others' poems in a voice so close to a murmur=2C and almost deathly last
breathing--that the audience leaned in closer and closer=2C became ever
more quiet a possible-to catch the patterns of breath which held in
their embraces the words as they faded out of distinguishable from--and
joined their breathy articulation with the flows or stillness of the
air--




It was always an honor and a joy to meet with James--he always made
one feel immediately you had joined him in a conspiracy--a kind of ally
in the general mayhem--and knowing one might have different overthrows
in mind=2C al the same sharing the urge to overthrow--



The last time i saw him was a few weeks ago=2C on the bus--as he was
getting on=2C he caught sight of me--and gesturing to the seated crowd
facing him--swept an arm towards me and told everyone aboard--"You have
in your presence David=2C the Good Black French Shepard=2C the Black Sheep
who guides the young flocks with his Dark French kind soul of the
poetes of the damned." =20

He sat and talked away of new poems and plans
and the latest events of the morning=2C adventures on the way to the bus=2C
the look of the sky--and all too soon=2C time for him to get off--a quick
remark about the construction going on=2C the ruination of old
bricks--and he was gone--and as always=2C his voice lingered in the air
after him--a music and poetry and presence  that keeps on playing--and
always will--



An honor and a joy to know this poet who made poetry so alive=2C made it li=
fe--and lived it so that others would understand this--

Miriam Makeba=2C Singer=2C Dies at 76







By ALAN COWELL




Ms. Makeba was a South African singer whose voice stirred hopes of
freedom in her own country even though her music was formally banned by
the apartheid authorities she struggled against.

http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/world/africa/11makeba.html?ei=3D5070&emc=
=3Deta

The United States supported apartheid in Makeba's homeland and now supports=
 it in another State=2C  which had also supported and armed the apartheid r=
egime in South Africa.


May there be hope that the changes inside the USA may be extended in its po=
licies to peoples around the world=2C rather than supporting the continuanc=
e of enforced  examples of the Bantustan existence Miriam Makeba worked tir=
elessly and beautifully to put an end to=2C everywhere.


May the USA's recent change=2C so much hailed=2C be indeed a real change=2C=
in actions and not simply in words=2C  and a real example that is extended =
to all people=2C and not only to some.  Otherwise=2C all over again=2C the =
US will be turning its example of hope=2C equality=2C change into that old =
familar face=2C that samo samo "American exceptionalism."

here in southern california, many african americans are historically
republican because of the legacy of dixiecrat racism (which has a weird
history in race politics in LA); I was surprised how many of my neighbors
had also converted to catholicism

I think you're really on to something with the Manicheanism of monotheism. The polytheistic Greeks and Romans were much more liberal in their views of sexuality. I'm one who believes people and societies evolve through levels. In religious terms: animism, polytheism, monotheism, deism, agnosticism/atheism. There's a new kind of spirituality, though, that somewhat embraces all these (though obviously more in favor of agnosticism over atheism, if religion is being embraced -- as with Frederick Turner in "Natural Religion", though there is in fact an atheistic version in Stuart Kauffman's "Reinventing the Sacred") in addition to the realities of nature, meaning there is an open acceptance of human beings in their full range and complexities.

Now, as for libertarianism, it is certainly against laws when possible. Which means it would be against any law prohibiting marriage, like Prop. 8. Also, libertarianism is very much on the side of civil rights, as civil rights violations were and are primarily legal violations. Prior to the Civil Rights Act, for example, it was state laws which prohibited African-Americans from riding at the front of the bus and going to certain restaurants. In truth, the bus companies as a group didn't care where you sat -- the law was there so that racists could be racists under the law, and wouldn't have to cave to market forces. Libertarians, like myself, are opposed to any sort of restriction on gays serving in the military. It shouldn't be an issue at all. After all, who in their right mind wouldn't have wanted to have had Alexander the Great leading their army? The truth is, and if you look at what they in fact do, it should be clear to anyone, the Democrats
 fairly consistently use various minority groups to get elected, and then turn around and do nothing to actually benefit those groups. Often they in fact do things to make those groups even more dependent upon them. Of course, the Republicans do the same thing with their groups -- everyone knows a marriage amendment to the Constitution won't ever be passed, but just proposing it makes the Religious Right happy.

Troy, that was a thoughtful response, and thank you for thinking about it.
To be honest I'm not interested in marriage myself, and have many concerns
about the institution of marriage for anyone wanting it.  However, it's
still none of my business if someone wants it, I'm just saying.

And yes, you're right about the views many Americans, especially religious
Americans of any color have about this idea of homosexuality being a
"choice."

Cultures with fundamentals of dualistic foundations like monotheism trade
"choice" against the formation of belief that two is the best number to
shoot from:  God and Satan, Male and Female, Black and White, etc.  America
can't even seem to support values outside of a Democrat and Republican party
system.  Christianity in particular in American has reductive qualities
which marginalize with a world-view from proper biblical points of
reference.

American colonists were HORRIFIED by the openly bisexual, homosexual,
transsexual Native Americans of this early pagan continent.  There are
Native American nations who had multiple genders, which confused and FREAKED
many of the early white Americans.  Well, not so much the Scotts and Irish
who settled in Appalachia maybe, but certainly the Virginians and the
Puritans, even the Quakers.

Am I saying we're too entrenched to get out of it?  No, I mean look at many
European countries who are also steeped in Christianity, they've become more
tolerant, but they also forced the issue of progress with governmental
intervention and laws.  I say this because I'm under the impression that the
Libertarian Party is about less governmental intervention.  But I admit I
know little about that party, but that's the gist I've gotten from them.

I'm actually for MORE regulation of all kinds, especially when it comes to
civil rights.  I'm not believing for a minute that it will make The
Haters like queers more, but it will protect queers who want to be
productive, contributing citizens if they so choose.

Back in the early 90s I heard Bill Clinton give a speech in DC when he was
first running for president, it was at some gay pride event, or march, or
something.  He said, and I remember him clearly saying this, that Yes we
should be allowed to be married, have the same rights, etc.  He instead gave
us the "right" of "Don't Ask Don't Tell" which was tantamount to saying,
"No, you're not equal, unless you're a killing machine."

But I remember how we all CHEERED and ROARED with excitement when Clinton
addressed us in DC.  And weeks after he and Gore won The White House I took
a lesbian friend of mine to see KD Lang for her birthday, it was Lang's
"Ingenue Tour" I believe.  But Lang ANNOUNCED from the stage these very same
things Clinton promised, and we all CHEERED and ROARED with excitement!  And
I still remember her saying through a cloud of bubbles (she had a giant
bubble-making machine on stage like Lawrence Welk), "I'm so glad Bill's in
office!"  We all CHEERED and ROARED again.  We were literally ecstatic!
Little did we know the real Bill Clinton at that time.  We were such suckers
for his promises at a time when we were SO EXHAUSTED from Reagan/Bush, and
hemorrhaging friends and the art world to AIDS.  It blew our minds that he
would even speak to us.  But we were SO duped!  He got our votes and
promptly dumped us.  WORSE than dumping us, MUCH WORSE, that asshole signed
the Defense of Marriage Act.  Wow!  I will always, ALWAYS hate Bill Clinton
for that signing!

Bill Clinton's legacy of lies is why I'm skeptical of Obama.  BUT, I do
believe Obama is a better human being than Bill Clinton ever was, even on
Clinton's best days.  I want Obama to be the man of conscience he appears to
be.  And I hope he is.  But still, saying queers should be allowed to visit
their dying partner in the hospital is hardly a step up from what Clinton
gave us.  Both Biden and Obama used this remark about hospital visitation,
and it made me angry.  But AT LEAST THEY DIDN'T lie.  I mean, neither man
promised us things like Clinton, so, I am grateful for that.  I'd rather be
told up front what to expect, which they gave.

Getting our greedy, bloodstained American hands out of Iraq was most
important to me when voting.  Everyone who voted for Obama had their
reasons.  Everyone FELT GOOD voting for Obama for their own reasons, and
mine was his steadfast claim that Iraq was wrong, was always wrong, and we
should get out.  I don't care about his gender or the color of his skin, his
courage to stand up against the American invasion and occupation of Iraq is
what sent me to vote.  And I don't use the word "courage" lightly.  It takes
REAL courage to tell a nation of people that they fucked up.  But he did it,
and we made him president, so that alone makes me hopeful.

The Asian American Writers' Workshop presents Kazim Ali, Myung Mi Kim,
Cathy Park Hong, Tan Lin, Warren Liu, and Dorothy Wang

Friday, November 14, 7pm
A special night featuring Kazim Ali and honoring Myung Mi Kim's Dura

    Join us for a special night honoring the work of legendary
experimental poet Myung Mi Kim and the re-release of her book Dura.

    The night begins with Kazim Ali, whose The Far Mosque, possesses,
in the words of Meena Alexander, "a metaphysical feel ... that renders
it fit for our globalized age, a geography underwritten by the loss of
fixed abode." Myung Mi Kim reads from Dura, a classic of avant-garde
poetics at once formally challenging and politically engaged.
Influenced by Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's Dictee, Dura is an investigation
of national and personal identity that asks, in the words of Sueyeun
Juliette Lee, both what it means to be Korean American and what it
means to define space in national terms. After the reading, four
prominent Asian American experimental poets--Cathy Park Hong, Tan Lin,
Warren Liu, and Dorothy Wang--respond to Dura and Myung's body of
work.

_______________


There's a new book by the poet Lanny Quarles.

You will find the ordering information at

http://stores.lulu.com/phanero

The poetry of Lanny Quarles is thought-provoking, effervescent and
chaotic.  His riffs and blathers never cease to amaze me.  Though very
much in the "now" of the times, and the "now" of the contorting of
language, his texts are still permeated with a struggle of philosophic
ideas balanced by a knowledge of artistic and literary history.

Mark, as much as I respect you I won't agree to the tone of taking Obama's
courage from him about this.  Yes, you're right he had no vote, but was very
vocal, saying all the sane, humane things.

John Kerry and Hillary Clinton GAVE Bush everything he needed, along with
many others.  From listening to Obama talk about the war for some time now I
believe, firmly believe, that if HE HAD HAD the vote that he would have
NEVER given Bush the OK with the other jerks!

There's not a soul who voted for the war who didn't realize that there was
NO reason to invade.  The entire thing was insane from the beginning.  Kerry
and Clinton didn't want to rock the boat on the issue.

It was hard times for a politician's nerves with the severe nationalistic
thunder after 911, a time that called for cool heads and courage to SEE what
was real and what was Bush/Cheney greed and plunder at work.

Obama hasn't JUST been against the war, he's made clear the vile intent
behind it.  This idea of him being against the war because it was "safe" for
him to be so is wrong in my opinion.  It's the very sort of thing Bill
Clinton said of Obama when he spoke of the fairy tale that Obama was.  But
Bill Clinton knew what was at stake, and needed to create a blurr around the
margins of the truth, something he's a real pro at.

When Obama confronted Hillary Clinton on the issue in the debates there was
little she could say since the whole world knew that she was part of
the reason for the murderous mess.  She and every other senator had A JOB TO
DO, and that job was to be the check and the balance against an imperial
presidency for war.  They failed.  They failed us, they failed Iraq, and
made the world a much MUCH more dangerous place as a result.

It's very strange how Pelosi "removed impeachment from the table" as soon as
she received her new position, and SHE was working with a very strong
antiwar, anti-Bush platform.  But it's no mistake that she did so right
after the German government declared that they would hold Rumsfeld for war
crimes if he ever stepped foot in Germany.  And the Germans waited for
Rumsfeld to be cut loose from the Bush cabinet.

It's my belief that Pelosi saw the German declaration as one that would
spread over the entire group of senators who gave Bush his power if Bush
were to be impeached.

If Bush were to be brought down on the grounds Pelosi wanted to bring him
down on, Kerry, Clinton, and many MANY others would fall with him.  AS THEY
SHOULD, just like Hitler's supporters.

In the end Obama was the ONLY person I could vote for in the primary once
Kucinich was out of the race.  By the time the primary made it's way to
Pennsylvania Kucinich wasn't even on the ballot.  I don't like the primary
system, and feel that every voter in the country should vote at the same
time.  I REALLY wanted my vote in the primary to go to Kucinich.

I had no idea Makeba died, what a loss!  She is someone THE AMAZING Selma

made sense, women working tirelessly against war, poverty, and other
institutions of greed.  http://www.globalwomenstrike.net/

A good friend recently borrowed my copy of THE BIG ONE, the Michael Moore
film Nike helped squash when it was first released (which makes sense once
you see that creepy interview with Nike CEO Phil Knight that Moore scored.
Knight offered Moore millions of dollars to cut the interview footage, but
Moore said NO WAY!).  My friend said the thing that struck her the most
(which is the thing about the film which also struck me the most) was the
AMAZING interview with Studs Terkel.  If you haven't seen this film, it's
marvelous, and THE ONLY post-NAFTA film of its kind, but, that interview
with Terkel is worth it alone!  I don't want to ruin it for those who
haven't seen it yet, but, let's just say Terkel and Moore have a VERY
INTERESTING discussion about a better, broader definition of terrorism than
what is commonly used.

Did anyone see the play they made of Studs Terkel's Working? -- I
thought  it was an amazing take on work -- sort of like Chorus Line
for the rest of us. The reviews were pretty negative at  the time,
which were more related to the politics than the quality of the play.

Subject:      Wole Soyinka on Obama's Victory
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Wole Soyinka spoke very enthusiastically last week about Obama's victory and
its implications for African (and global) politics.

Here is are a few of his words:

"Because the main lesson of Obama for the continent, in particular the
continent of sit-tight rulers is that those who believe that leadership
depends on religion, race, ethnic belonging, class, place of origin, status
in life are still living in the past. They are completely antiquated beings,
who should not be regarded as civilised personalities."
There is a tendency to see this election as simply a shift for one set of
governmental policies to another, one set of administrators to another. It
is that, and after the policies and administrators we in the U.S. have been
stuck with the last eight years, I am damned glad for it. But it is far
more. Obama's victory has the possibility of weakening one of the most
powerful forces behind oppression of every sort, the idea that certain
groups of people are naturally destined to occupy certain strata of society.
I do not expect to see evidence of this change immediately, or even within
Obama's term. And I do not expect it to happen as the result of this
election alone. But this election does provide us (and by us I do not mean
only U.S.) an opportunity to examine the politics of the past, and focusing
on the obviously antiquated nature of certain of the Democratic party's
policies misses the point.

Here is a link to the article (quoted above) about Soyinka's press
conference:

For those who might be interested, the following press announcement =
relates to my new book of essays and commentaries, Poetics & Polemics, =
just published in the University of Alabama Press's Modern & =
Contemporary Poetics series.  My co-editor is Steven Clay and the =
introduction is by Hank Lazer.



[The Press's announcement reads]: "Poetics & Polemics, 1980-2005 brings =
together in one volume a wide-ranging selection of essays and =
commentaries by one of the most significant poets, critics, and =
translators working with American and international poetry today.  =
Jerome Rothenberg's work spans a period of over forty years and nearly =
one hundred books, and though perhaps best known as a poet, his critical =
and theoretical contributions to the fields of innovative, experimental =
poetry have become equally important facets of his work. Rothenberg's =
earliest critical writings concerned themselves with ethnopoetics and =
the poetics of performance. In the last twenty years his critical =
thinking has evolved to encompass more explicitly issues of modernism, =
postmodernism, and the avant-garde, as well as meditations on the nature =
of the book and writing. This volume extends and elaborates all of those =
interests, allowing for the first time a comprehensive glimpse of the =
full trajectory of his thinking. In the first section, 'Poetics and =
Polemics,' Rothenberg's essays address a range of issues with which he's =
become closely associated, among them the anthology as a critical and =
polemical tool; the intersection of poetry with art, performance, and =
politics, in both contemporary and traditional practice; the poetics of =
Jewish mysticism as a traditional form of conceptual and language =
poetry; and the universality of poetic discourse, particularly as seen =
in tribal poetry or in poetic traditions long separated from the Western =
literary mainstream. In 'A Gallery of Poets' is Rothenberg's lively =
explorations of the work of other poets, as they relate to his own work, =
to avant-garde poetry in general, and to the poetic traditions that =
concern him the most. Finally, in 'Dialogues and Interviews' are =
Rothenberg's unbridled meditations and musings on what he calls 'the =
life of poetry' outside the bounds of book and binding, class and =
category, a dynamic force at the center of all that we call human."=20

co-edited with Jeffrey Robinson.

MIME-Version: 1.0

CIAC on Second Life Art

Check this out - articles by Patrick Lichty on Second Front and Second
Life art in general; Domenico Quaranto on my installation; a good article
on Gaz' recent work; Fred Forest dans Second Life par Fred Forest; and
others. http://www.ciac.ca/magazine/sommaire.htm The whole magazine is
really good; I've been looking through back issues.

More experimentation with Julu Twine:

Look closely and you'll see a red circular object, as well as a number of
other shapes, dropping in steps from the sky back into the installation.
Here is how it happened: Julu Twine rode the object (i.e. sat on it) as it
revolved on the floor of the installation. The object has a Disappear
script which requires it to rise 25m when an avatar is present. Since the
rising is accompanied by the avatar, the rising is continuous until the
avatar leaves the object; at that point, the object very slowly begins to
sink back to its original position. Dropping records the sinking.

http://www.alansondheim.org/dropping.mp4

There is also http://www.alansondheim.org/julurising.mp4 - Julu approach-
ing the object, sitting on it - at which point the object immediately
begins to rise.

One can imagine an elevator system running on Second Life Physics - how-
ever it might take a half hour or so for the elevator to return to the
ground; not only that, but if you stepped on it somewhere up in the sky,
you'd only go higher.

So a cheap rocket up and down, but the latter without passengers.

Hello poets and poetics:

this post leaves aside the debate regarding what one ought to feel about the
election of Obama; I reckon we are at least free to feel differently and
variegatedly from moment to moment about it.  But the astonishing events of
the past week have led me as a relative youngster within history and the
genre to ponder what it is actually like to operate as an artist in a
context of national leadership conceived of (by an apparent majority) as
worthy or promising of the title.  As such, I'm seeking engaging and/or
thoughtful resources on poetry in the era of (the live) Kennedy.  Thanks for
any pointers you may be able to offer.

Hi Jen:=20

Ironically - in the context of doing a presentation for the commemoration o=
f 1968 Strike at San Francisco State - I re-activated an essay I wrote in 1=
964, "Days Without the President" - which dealt with time-frame of the Birm=
ingham demonstrations (Bull Connor et al) in which it took JFK for ever to =
use his Federal powers to intervent. (Sound familiar?) . But the piece is r=
eally about the transitional period in which 'integration' was being reject=
ed by many Blacks in favor of cultural and economic nationalisms, self-defe=
nse et al.=A0 It's a 'poetic, personal' essay - in time in which Baldwin, M=
ailer, and many others used the essay for person self-exploration and publi=
c persuasion. Of course, it was a highly conflicted time for white and blac=
ks trying to sort it all out.=20

It seems to me, unless I am missing an important chunk, poetry (in the late=
 50's and the JFK regime) was relatively moribund as an important public ac=
t until after JFK's assasination. My perhaps foggy impressions is that the =
Beats were relativey out of the picture - in Asia & Japan -=A0 until Allen =
Ginsberg re-emerged in 1965 (spring. Prague, et al). (Which is not say poet=
s were not reflecting on politics, and, particularly, The Bomb. Whether the=
re is interesting stuff from Adrienne Rich, I am not sure. Levertov's polit=
ical work is later. As with a whole era of Anti-War poets as provoked by LB=
J's expansion of the War. Essays seemed to rule the public ropes, the disco=
urse.=20

People/ students in my panel were really intrigued with the period.=A0 It w=
as interesting to re-explore a time which we, the young, were totally impli=
cated in history (race relations, Vietnam war and the draft, etc. There was=
 no hiding permitted, such as today, where the young, at least the middle c=
lass and wealthy, have ways to insulate themselves.)

However, with the current global collapse coming at us from all sides, comb=
ined the multiple expectations and hopes placed on a new regime, the JFK/LB=
J eras seem to beckon. At the Strike commmoraton The young were totally in =
awe of the descriptions of the kinds of actions of the time - probably, in =
part, a nostalgia for the 'heroic', such as it was. Like a relish for organ=
ic food, instead of Media duplications/simulations of no matter what form o=
f "reality".=20

It looks to me like David Chirot's address book has been hacked into and
e-mails are being sent to his contacts purporting to be from him, stranded
in Africa and in desperate need of money to be immediately wired. Needless
to say, this is the latest advancement of the Nigerian scams... So if you
get that e-mail, be warned.

Well, the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban missile crisis sure gave us

I'll stand by my statement. I was also very vocal about the war,
but  I don't think that involved a lot of courage, and I don't expect
to be elected to public office.

Obama got elected because it was a difficult year for a Democrat to
lose and because he had an enormous amount of money to spend. It does
matter that he got elected even though he's black, but that's a less
cataclysmic change than some represent. I'm with (black) Washington
Post columnist William Raspberry on this: "It's been said that the
ascendancy of Barack Obama signals the beginning of a "post-racial"
America. I wish. What we have witnessed, I think, is something less
profound but still hugely significant. Obama's election means that in
America, including at the highest levels of our politics, race is no
longer an automatic deal-breaker. That's a major step forward in the
thinking of white America."

He's way better than the alternative. Now let's see what he's willing to risk.

I've known David for about 15 years, maybe as long as some, less than others. Given his current situation, I think it is doubtful. Having said that, I thought the email, while clearly suspicious, was not so unrepresentative of his emails.

How about someone call him and bring this to rest. I do not have his current tele#.
Alex

Jen: I think Steve got this about right. Camelot was a media
invention, and it only lasted three years, during which very little
was accomplished. Whatever one thought about Eisenhower, he was
nothing like as destructive as Bush, and there was no national sigh
of relief. And Kennedy won by the slimmest of margins, and less than
a majority--there was a third party. I don't remember any resultant
stirring in the arts. That came later, after Johnson liberated all
the angels and demons.

Thanks, Stephen--I'd like to read your essay.

What intrigues me at this point is the question of whether political joy can
enter the poetic as nonsuspect, even constructive, instead of merely fueling
duped patriotic hymns--or whether negativity is the only viable form of
sociopolitical intervention open to poetry.  I can certainly see why the
essay functioned as refuge and platform.  It also makes sense to me that
"poetry was relatively moribund as an important public act until after JFK's
assassination."

George, can you point me to sources?  I'd be interested.

A terrible story. Happens often. Too, I am reminded of the celebrations in Kenya recently following Obama's election. Reason to celebrate, indeed, I suppose, a great man given the opportunity to demonstrate further greatness. But I fear that many have forgotten that Kenya, once celebrated for its democracy, was ripped apart in brutal violence just this year (and following elections). I am afraid that folks tend to have a short memory with regards to these areas - and, quite frankly, I am not sure that either Bono or George Clooney do very much to inform us in such a way that we might be intentional in our response - as citizens of the world.

Hi Barry,
I feel seriously hurt by your use of the term "*Nigerian* scams"! What makes
you think that scamming is a Nigerian thing? Perhaps you need to read the
history of scamming, if you have not done so. People like Al Capone and
other well known crooks practised conmanship in America many decades before
what came to be known as 419 in Nigeria emerged.

I have a fair knowledge of the history of conmanship in America (as a
criminologist!), but cannot talk of "American scam", unless I mean to insult
that great country. I think we need to be careful in the way we criminalize
and stereotype other societies. Or is that not part of the netiquette at
POETICS?
Be well!

For what it's worth, there was an interesting NY Times article about what
DID change during this last election:

http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/us/politics/11south.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=the%20south%20loses%20it%27s%20hold%20on%20politics&st=cse&oref=slogin

Furthermore, I think it's worth separating the election moment and the
feeling and meaning involved from it's wake and aftershock/math.

I write in praise of the Belgian poet, visual poet, & net-artist known
as <__lo-y. > ...

I have followed the work of <__lo-y. > since 2002, with great interest
& appreciation.  Much of her work is profoundly original & dynamic, in
conception & in action.  Her work is not rooted in functionality or
utility.  The deliberate assembling of text & character symbols have
constantly referred to the formal possibilities of the code behind
digital content, making it its subject.  The poems of <__lo-y. > are
abstract works, stripped of narrative, subjectivity, or factional
slant.

In one descriptive statement from Lo_y, she wrote "well there's not
much to say.  Lo_y is only what Lo_y writes.  No history, no stories,
no explanations ..."

Last night - at Moe's Bookstore in Berkeley - I was listening to Hilton Obe=
nzinger read from his novel, Busy Dying (Chax), which in part deals with th=
e takeover at Columbia University in 1968. Even tho the NY cops - retaking =
Low Library - beat 'the shit' out everybody in the President's Office (well=
, David Shapiro, the poet, managed to escape earlier on!), Hilton accounts =
of the great sense of joy, operative unity and exhilaraton among the demons=
trators.=20
In San Francisco, during the 1964 sit-in demonstrations in San Francisco (w=
hich were to compel Hotels, Supermarkets and Auto Dealers to hire black emp=
loyees), there was, indeed, a sense of great joy in victories. However, it =
was also a time or rampant paranoia if you were on the left as to what migh=
t be 'coming down.'=A0 There was also, at least among the middle class demo=
nstrators, an apprehension of what might be coming down from parents, futur=
e job applications (if arrested), and a change of draft eligibility status =
if you were a student. So, if I am interpreting you correctly, whether or t=
he term 'negativity' as some kind of absolute condition means much in actio=
ns that are continuously morphing - from great highs to the depths of depre=
ssion, especially when an action fails, and the big guys still hold the pow=
er.

I would not dismiss the best of the early sixties essays - if this is your =
sense - as either counter-poetic or primarily mental exercises. To the cont=
rary. The best of Baldwin, among other writers, to which some would add Joa=
n Didion,=A0 get their intelligence out of a primary, experiential sense of=
 event and location.

Sadly, or ineveitably what was best about the essay, devolved into "Persona=
l Journalism" in which 'the writer's condition' became the subject, as diff=
erent from writing objectively in response to a larger=A0 'public condition=
'. Rolling Stone, the mag/tabloid, by the end of the Sixties was drenched w=
ith 'personal essays' - in which the persons were not that interesting, or =
much more invested in attracting folks to their unique brand of narcissism.=
=20

A speculation comes to mind:=A0 the percieved adversion to 'the personal' b=
y many of the Language Poets, along with=A0 the interest in abstraction and=
 theory, the primacy of text, etc. - was in part a rejection, a 'fed-upness=
' with the 60's fetish with personal identity and experience - even it's po=
litically potent forms of gender and ethnic self-exploration. =A0=A0 Ironic=
ally, as if in the inevitable 'eternal return of the repressed' - the Grand=
 Piano series of volumes can strike me as, finally, a release of LP's 'pers=
onal' - all that stuff behind the curtains of the 70's and 80's. Who would =
have thought??

As post thought, I don't think you will get to core of 60's politcal/poetry=
 muses without exploring the relationships of Bob Dylan, Allen Ginsberg, Wo=
ody Guthrie & Pete Seeger. Out of that blend knowledges and roots of Americ=
an folklore (from dark twisted surreal roots to evangelical hights) Dylan m=
anaged to create a 'poetic' ticket much greater public power than any post-=
JFK-assasination poet that I can think of. Yet, his reasons for morphing ou=
t of that role are also interesting.=20

Thanks, Stephen--I'd like to read your essay.

What intrigues me at this point is the question of whether political joy ca=
n
enter the poetic as nonsuspect, even constructive, instead of merely fuelin=
g
duped patriotic hymns--or whether negativity is the only viable form of
sociopolitical intervention open to poetry.  I can certainly see why the
essay functioned as refuge and platform.  It also makes sense to me that
"poetry was relatively moribund as an important public act until after
JFK's
assassination."

language publisher or the author if the piece has not been published.
We especially like and appreciate works bordering on the absurd and
strange, but we are open to all styles of writing and expression.
Since we've just had such a historic election, I'd like to turn this
next issue's focus toward works that celebrate, investigate, and
evoke those new, previously unimaginable realities that have already
started to occur in the American 'zeitgeist,' thanks in part to the
outcome of November's election. While I'm optimistic over our
direction, I can appreciate the shuddering over Prop. 8 (which I
share), so works need not be optimistic in nature--they can question
these  contradictions as they play out in our culture as well.

Submission guidelines:

Please submit your written work in the body of your email to
submission@superficialflesh.com. All submissions must include
"Submission" and the author's last name in the subject heading. In
the subject heading, please note the type of submission you are
including as well (fiction, poetry, etc). All artwork must be sent
in .jpg format. No more than five poems, or one story, per
submission. We are a very, very small literary outlet so we pay in
the form of two contributors copies.

Please visit our website to look at our electronic journal (though we
do a small print run as well and you can order a print copy via our
website). Online registration is free.

After our issues sell-out (or nearly) we're going to
post them on-line, so the work can keep rippling out
forever to Australia and Detroit and Paris, Texas.  We
love on-line journals, but we also love the book in
our hands, so we're trying to do a little of both.
This one's about 200 pages in print, and if you click
on the EAR you can listen to some stuff from our first
three issues, back when we had a sound engineer as
intern.

That's a very good point. And a very straight one.
We certainly need to watch out for such prejudice even if it isn't always
intended.
I have made such blemishes in the past too.

No, it is not a good point.
To say "Nigerian scams" is not to say that scams are necessarily
Nigerian.
The very grammar suggests that only some scams are Nigerian.
If we say US gangsters, that is not to say that all gangsters are
USAmericans.
Here's another parallel: if I complain about Meyer Lansky,
that does not make me anti-semitic.
I have received many many scam letters from Nigeria in the last year.
Some from South Africa, too. The latter were South African scam letters.

Well, the use of email to scam people originated in Nigeria. The term, 419
Letter Scam, is used because 419 is the Nigerian criminal code designated
for email scams.

I take offense to use of the term "conman," which seems to imply that all
conniving anti-social personalities that seek to remove money from one
person's pocket into the pocket of another person who might be more or less
deserving of said funds are men. We need to not use "Nigerian" or "con man"
to refer to either of these processes/individuals. For now, "con artist"
will do.

In Barry's defense, if the above cannot be termed so, it seems the email
scam did first originate in Nigeria, and still has a more booming business
there than certain other countries. The Iraq War is the Iraq War because it
takes place in Iraq.

Below are a few lines from Niyi Osundare's poem " Entry Point Encounter,"  a
dialogue with a customs officer who detains him after hearing he travels
with a Nigerian passport. Among other things, the poem deals with the
consequences of calling the 419 scam "Nigerian."  The poet's passport is
marked with the same word, "Nigerian," and thus it and its owner are linked
falsely to criminal behavior.

"You're Nigerian?"
"I thought I told you so"
"Have you ever been convicted of fraud?"
"No"
"Have you ever been denied a visa?"
"No"

Pause

"You know that thing called 419?"
"I've heard about it
But, I assure you,
If 419 and I meet in the street
We won't recognize each other"

This poem is in Osundare's *Pages from the Book of the Sun: New and Selected
Poems*

There's a reason for calling them "Nigerian Scams" as the vast majority of
them can be traced back to Nigeria.  There are a sizeable number fro Benin
and a smattering of others from Zambia and other countries in that general
vicinity, but for the most part they're from Nigeria.  I get dozens of them
in various e-mail accounts every day, so I speak from some first-hand
experience.  While it's true that con games are not country-dependent, this
type of e-mail trawling for victims seems to have a strong Nigerian flavor.
To paraphrase Walter Brennan, "It's not an insult if it's true."

Personally I take it amiss that one i,plies I exhibited prejudice, even "un=
intended." It is well known that Nigeria has a little industry of these int=
ernet scams. I didn't make it up, and nothing I wrote can be taken as imply=
ing anything about Nigerians in general. If I said, "here's something new i=
n French wines," would that mean I was implying that all French people work=
 in the wine industry?

That's a very good point. And a very straight one.
We certainly need to watch out for such prejudice even if it isn't always
intended.
I have made such blemishes in the past too.

Not all scams are Nigerian." About a year ago, somebody in China hacked m=
y
computer. I spent two days deleting over 1000  messages that bounced back=
 to
my address. To get out of the situation, I had to change my email address=

Nobody has a lock on greed. Anybody from any country can hack your comput=

find yourself caught in.

ussion and alarm=2C and my sympathies and thanks to those who felt concern=
=2C and apologies for being so=2C when the cause is a scam.  My apt mate re=
ceived the message on his email and told me if he didn't know I was in my r=
oom next to his=2C he would have felt really bad=2C as the letter very much=
 moved him.  I told him actually I receive quite alot of these=2C and espec=
ially heartrending are the ones in French=2C which sometimes wil have also =
a little foto gallery triptych of an attractive young and religious woman w=
ith  soft focus backgrounds.  The letters from le  monde Francophone also t=
ake for granted I have a wider acceptance (which in actuality I do)  of var=
ious forms of religion that in the Western Hemisphere developed into Haitia=
n Voudon and aspects of the Hoodoo Man and Conjure Woman=2C John the Conque=
roo et alia in the Southern US.=20





The great number of letters on a few lists very much struck me--and the fac=
t that no one actually wrote me myself and I=2C other than my son=2C who wr=
ote to alert me.=20

In the later afternoon my good friend Aryanil Mukherjee called and we spoke=
 for along time. It was our first phone conversation=2C and very inspiring.=
=20




I wondered if there is a superstition in itself of writing to persons of wh=
om one is not sure if this is that person or some one else?  I mean a super=
stition beyond wariness or fear of embarrassment at having made a mistake i=
n identity=2C having been fooled?




A superstition almost as if the person is perhaps a form of "possessed bein=
g=2C" like a zombie or some kinds of ghosts are?  Or in actuality=2C not a =
few living beings one encounters are--in airports and classrooms=2C deliver=
y vans and parade grounds=2C among the police officers and and bathing suit=
 beauties--among cardboard cut-outs and "conventional characters" littering=
 obsessively the worlds of  newsreels and history=2C the cinema=2C the nove=
l=2C the poem=2C ancient vases--statuary--




A superstition in fact almost as though the invoked name is that belonging =
to one of the dead--or=2C again the living-dead--some creature not unlike a=
 politician or soap opera character and actress/actor who is "ever present"=
--"eternally a beacon to the adoring and faithfull believers"--just as they=
 are there forever also for poets--





It also struck me very much as a new aspect of many of the themes=2C topics=
 and subjects disccussed lately=2C among them "death" of the "author=2C" ap=
propriation=2C possession=2C hoaxes=2C heteranonymity=2C and something else=
 which I've raised fairly often=2C the need to check sources=2C for so much=
 of the so called "information" on the "Information Highway" is disinformat=
ion of all sorts=2C from financial to Propaganda schemes=2C government blac=
k flag ops to "merry pranks."  There are even those that purport to be havi=
ng something to do with art (the one about the artist's starving a dog in a=
 gallery=2C) or a poet mass mailing an anti-Muslim fake news article despit=
e claiming afterwards to having doubts about its veracity=2C because he bel=
ieved in the cause the "article's" intended and actual widespread negative =
effects were for (the Leevi Lehto case.)





There is a kind of cliche both in life/death and in the plot of novels=2C s=
tories and films=2C of the artist or writer whose death is faked=2C in orde=
r to send the value of their work skyrocketing. This little scam is based o=
n the very real observation of how often it occurs that some nearly forgott=
en figure has been is suddenly resurrected by death and not only restored t=
o a former glory=2C but suddenly begins to attain a reknown no one had ever=
 dreamed them or their work capable of. The "disappearance" of some "enigma=
tic" artist or writer who had created a slim oeuvre when known to be alive =
and yet=2C after "death=2C" is found to have produced quite a bounty of wor=
ks which lead one ever further into what is now considered one of the most =
daring and audacious and fertile grounds for the future--this disappearance=
 will vault the artist's works and name into the stratospheres of value=2C =
while behind the scenes=2C somewhere=2C from time to time he or she produce=
s casually a work or three to add to the heap of previously undiscovered fr=
agments=2C notes=2C doodles=2C memorandum=2C sketches=2C small studies=2C e=
tc.=20





This case of the David Chirot email provides yet another version=2C in whic=
h the person them self is suddenly finding them self discussed at a distanc=
e=2C as though they are not present at all=2C via emails discussing an emai=
l which has=2C many agree=2C not been sent by David Chirot.  Or has it been=
?  As a Prank?  Or in reality? =20





On the part of many=2C there is a concern for the person=2C and on the part=
 of others=2C the developing concern that various ideas that are held about=
 the emails not being sent by Chirot are correct.

Of course=2C there is no rise at all in any value in the worthless works of=
 David Chirot=2C whether or not he is in Africa=2C whether or not he sent t=
he email and whether or not he is paying attention or not to what is being =
written about him as though he is=2C if not in Africa=2C at least elsewhere=
 as yet among the living.





Since the identity of David Chirot was stolen and used by some one else unk=
nown=2C the resultant responses to the email itself are what might be thoug=
ht of as the "after effects" of the "name" David Chirot" as known on email =
and as a person in a few instances.  These "after effects" bear an odd rela=
tion both to the "ghostwritten" and the "posthumous" and in this case becom=
e related to something I have called before the ghosthumous.  Curiously=2C =
when being considered as being or not being in Africa=2C the David Chirot n=
ame usually present has been supplanted by an unknown bearing that name=2C =
and thus given a strange sensation of the "other" David Chirot "not being h=
ere"--whether or not they are actually in Africa.





Hence the email takes on this ghostwritten character=2C or ghosthumous=2C g=
host written from the beyond the grave character=2C glowing radioactively w=
ith the fall out of "after effects" in the thickets and clearings of asemic=
s=2C signs=2Cletters=2C words and phrases.





Along the way=2C the accumulation of commentaries and details regrading var=
ious aspects of the "other David Chirot" (the non-email message one)--begin=
s to construct its own small form of "biography/portrait" "wanted poster" "=
Have You Seen Him?" poster and so forth--and begins to develop into a discu=
ssion of the language applied to the emails--and so soon enough=2C one real=
izes=2C the disappearance of the David Chirots will no longer be missed at =
all.




In fact=2C the disappearance of the disappearance of the David Chirot. is a=
lready one assumes taking effect=2C and the only means by which one may mak=
e certain that one is not forgotten is to write a letter in which one hopes=
 others will indeed find it in their hearts to believe the veracity of.




But then--once=2C burned=2C twice shy!!

How does anyone from now on know who it is really writing under the name "D=
avid Chirot"--


Perhaps "David Chirot" has become something more like a Tag--to be sprayed =
on a wall--used in a mural--sent into the atmospheres--as the disintegratio=
n of particles--


However=2C if David Chirot's identity has been stolen and paraded about and=
 discussed=2C and exploited in potentia=2C might not David Chirot return to=
 re appropriate that name=2C that identity--and to re take POSSESSION not s=
imply of identity and "copyright" and such tedious things=2C but also of th=
e spirit of David Chirot--the appropriation that the first David Chirot wro=
te of that tends to be regarded by most as "primitive=2C" yet that that Dav=
id Chirot takes as true=2C actual.





To appropriate this identity theft=2C one then appropriates al the response=
s it has generated=2C as the "after effects " writings of this "after effec=
t" of the name and persona of "David Chirot" as someone existing on email l=
ists. =20





In other words=2C what one now has before one is the creation out of the bl=
ue of an anthology.

In a note found just as I began to write this=2C Catherine Daley is respond=
ing to the "Illuminations" and "Illuminated manuscripts" and mystic illumin=
ations I had brought up in relation with writing--her question in part bein=
g=2C may these be disciplined=2C as one does with writing? =20





It is not perhaps that one disciplines these or the ability to create their=
 circumstances for occurring=2C as the other way round=2C which is to keep =
on making oneself more available to the awareness of how many of these are =
continually occurring all around one all the time. At the great risk of bor=
ing everyone yet again--"hidden in plain site/sight/cite."





"I do not seek=2C I find."=20

These "after effects" of  an email by a "David Chirot" who has hacked into =
David Chirot's address book in order to use David Chirot's name--are among =
the after effects of a person and writer already writing "After Rimbaud's I=
lluminations" and other works concerning  "After " effects--"After Lorca-Af=
ter Spicer-After Yasusada-"etc etc--





So the proliferation of the after effects of "After Rimbaud's Illuminations=
" becomes a David Chirot in Africa=2C like Rimbaud=2C and also a David Chir=
ot who is not David Chirot=2C like that "I is an other/I is somebody else" =
that many see in the Rimbaud in Africa as compared to the Rimbaud who had b=
een a poet in Europe.





David Chirot=2C the Milwaukee one=2C by appropriating and taking possession=
 of this legacy of "After effects" of "some other David Chirot" who had sto=
len David Chirot's name and created the effects which that name generated--=
then produces an anthology of the responses which is basically "assembled" =
 not by "an "editor/author at all but simply "the name function" David Chir=
ot as it were=2C both an anonymous/pseudonymous person and another person w=
ho really does bear legally that name.





All the works in the anthology are the emails of others responding to the o=
riginal email of David Chirot in Africa.
With perhaps a letter at the end from the "other" David Chirot in Milwaukee=
.

Wystan Curnow had said that nowhere in al I had written did i mention or wr=
ite about the conventional.  On the contrary=2C in al I had written last we=
ek and before in these discussions re appropriation=2C has been the presenc=
e of the conventional as that absence at the heart of al the methods and ex=
amples I gave of the means to elude the conventional=2C not to ossify into =
it it=2C to skip over it=2C go around=2C under it=2C explode it=2C fly over=
=2C parody it=2C make a slightly off copy of it that is its satiric downfal=
l and so on and on--




to be like those"words who intentions are fugitive" and of which it is almo=
st impossible to construct a glossary of that Burroughs writes of in the in=
troduction to Junkie.

And what then is the conventional--the conventional is al that massive accu=
mulation  of details=2C images=2C words=2C sayings=2C ideas=2C propagandas=
=2C concepts=2C unquestioned beliefs=2C with which one is taught to continu=
ally not be aware of what is hidden in plain site/sight/cite. Not to think =
for oneself but be given the illusion that one is.






"To be cast o'er
with the sickly pale of convention"

so to speak--

The examination of many contemporary examples of "resistant=2C" "radical=2C=
 innovative" work provides  a genealogy and typology of a series of appropr=
iations of ever more entropical conventions of the "radical" and "avant gar=
de" of a century ago. Many previously controversial  aspects are trimmed aw=
ay=2C to attempt to make the new "product" appear "leaner and meaner" or "l=
eaner and cleaner."  "Lite" versions appear=2C more "user friendly" ones--





Precisely what "empowers" the "innovative=2C radical" aspects and energies =
is that they are conventional and so are easy to recognize and identify wit=
h as  "authoritative" expressions of radical=2C innovative anti-authoritari=
anism via their self created revision of the "traditions of the avant-garde=
."





These themselves reverse engineer their anti-authoritarianism into authoria=
ianism and capitalize in the process on the re-assertion of their authorita=
tive anti-authoritative stance.

(note below are links to some examples of this--)





(i wrote something else a few days ago re the conventional to send when I g=
et better--will send on later on--.)

(but then what is more conventional perhaps to say--than "you have not spok=
en of the conventional so everywhere present-"--




that is because=2C the conventional is so everywhere at all times al encomp=
assing ever present that --is it not continually speaking for itself--t the=
 poi8nt of suffocation of al else--
what Dubuffet called "Asphyxiating Culture"--




and so does not need me at all to speak of it --

other than to suggest ways to get around=2C through outside underneath fly =
over--tear it to shreds--etc--)

There was a great deal of discussion recently regarding an anthology of poe=
try produced by a program designed by specific individuals for use with a c=
omputer  The names of many poets living and dead were assigned to the poems=
=2C in order=2C one thinks perhaps=2C to gain it more attention--create bit=
 more long winded "controversy."





A number of persons were appalled that one might associate such a method wi=
th the possibilities also of producing fake evidences using computers and t=
hen assigning them to names and thus producing "suspects" to be rounded up =
and "detained" and tortured. In other rods=2C an anthology could be constru=
cted also a form of camouflage for such a mission=2C or simply as a poetry =
anthology as this "One" was=2C via computer written poems being assigned to=
 actual living and dead poet's names.





Here we have a case indeed of an unknown someone stealing the email identit=
y and name of a person most likely unknown to them  for monetary gain under=
 other circumstances than that of the actual person bearing the legal name.=
 Yet by producing responses to this "work" which bears the "name" of the "D=
avid Chirot in Milwaukee" this "non-author" is "resulting in" "after effect=
s" of the uses of the name of David Chirot when it is thought to be that of=
 a specific David Chirot




who is indeed a person interested in appropriation and writing and so in tu=
rn=2C not to be taken possession of=2C makes the move known in cards as "tr=
umping the trumper" "and takes the hand."  ("Tromper le trompeur: c'est dou=
ble plaisir")




(Hand being the meaning of "chiro")

Unless=2C of course=2C the hacker turns out to be someone who is playing a =
prank using the name of David Chirot on everyone who thinks that this is th=
e name that they know as David Chirot and in turn on the  David Chirot who =
also thinks that it is this particular David Chirot that is meant.





Or indeed is a poetic Prankster who is trying out a poetic experiment

In the sense of possession=2C one must sometimes=2C perforce=2C be a Repo m=
an=2C yes-!

Hi Barry,
I feel seriously hurt by your use of the term "*Nigerian* scams"!
What makes
you think that scamming is a Nigerian thing? Perhaps you need to read the
history of scamming, if you have not done so. People like Al Capone and
other well known crooks practised conmanship in America many decades before
what came to be known as 419 in Nigeria emerged.

I have a fair knowledge of the history of conmanship in America (as a
criminologist!), but cannot talk of "American scam", unless I mean to
insult
that great country. I think we need to be careful in the way we criminalize
and stereotype other societies. Or is that not part of the netiquette at
POETICS?
Be well!

The Departed







By JONATHAN LETHEM




Roberto Bola=F1o's posthumous novel is not only a capstone to his own
vaulting ambition, but a landmark in what's possible for the form in
our increasingly, and terrifyingly, post-national world.

I need to get rid of 12 bookcases. They're professionally-made,
stained, with brackets for moveable shelves, four feet high, widths
20-37 inches. They came from a defunct bookshop. Anyone who can get
to me (I'm in northern Manhattan) can have as many as she/he wants
for the asking. Please backchannel.

BIG BELL #2 RELEASE PARTY
ADOBE BOOKS
16th between valencia & guerrero
November 20th
8 pm

with readings by
Bill Berkson
Leigh Gallagher
 & Sunnylyn Thibodeaux

& featuring Conspiracy of Venus

Bill Berkson lives in San Francisco and New York. His latest books are *BILL
* with Colter Jacobsen, *Our Friends Will Pass Among You Silently*, and *Sudden
Address: Selected Lectures 1981-2006*. Coffee House Press will publish
his *Portrait
and Dream: New & Selected Poems 1959-2008* in Spring 2009.

Despite having led a rather quiet and inconsequential life, Leigh
Gallagheris a happy person who likes monogrammed pajamas, prescription
opiates, lucky
scratchers, little boys, pure caffeine, sincere weeping, rhomboidal
square-dance, pedestrian comedy, pretentious literature, documentary film,
and of course, the great outdoors. As of late she spends her time in a
plywood shack or amongst fancy baked goods, depending on the season.

Sunnylyn Thibodeaux is from New Orleans. Her poems have appeared in Blue
Book, Big Bridge, Night Palace, Morning Train, and other various magazines.
Small books include: Curves & Curses, Last We Spoke, 20/20 Yielding, United
Untied, and Hidden Driveways Ahead (forthcoming). With Micah Ballard, she
co-edits Auguste Press.

Conspiracy of Venus was formed in early 2007 with the artistic direction of
Joyce Todd McBride, whose unique and haunting arrangements bring new
dimensions to familiar songs. The all women's choir is devoted to exploring
the art and technique of singing music that ranges from cutting edge to
classic including songs by Bjork, Joni Mitchell, Hildegard von Bingen, Tom
Waits, Rufus Wainwright, and Leonard Cohen. This sister group to Conspiracy
of Beards rings out 25 voices strong and continually intrigues Bay-Area
audiences. http://conspiracyofvenus.blogspot.com/

That's a very good point. And a very straight one.
We certainly need to watch out for such prejudice even if it isn't always intended.
I have made such blemishes in the past too.

The first time I heard a poet read out loud or knew that poetry existed =
was when Robert Frost recited THE GIFT OUTRIGHT at JFK's inauguration. M=
y 8 1/2-year-old consciousness was wowed by his ghostly figure on the fa=
mily's teeny-weeny Zenith B&W. Sure his performance was shaky and he cam=
e off as a bit of a bumbler and the poem presented American history from=
 an european colonists' point-of-view and I might not have understood a =
word of it then, but I learned from that event (even if subconsciously) =
that poetry mattered, and beyond that, it mattered in the public sphere.=
 I'm not saying I wouldn't have become a poet if I had not experienced F=
rost's struggle for sense and imagery, but something touched me deeply t=
hat day which still rumbles in and from my soul.

Poetic Memoir and Lyrical Nonfiction: A Master Class with Katy Lederer
Saturday, November 15, 2008; 1-3pm ($25 includes workshop and reading)

In this workshop, Katy Lederer, author of the memoir Poker Face: A Girlhood
Among Gamblers and a poetry editor at Fence Magazine, will discuss various
craft elements of the poetic or lyric memoir, including tone, syntax, point
of view, dialogue, and paragraph structure. The focus will be on students'
own projects and their development. We will be undertaking several
free-writing exercises, so bring paper and pen.

Katy Lederer is the author of the poetry collections, Winter Sex (Verse
Press, 2002) and The Heaven-Sent Leaf (BOA Editions, forthcoming 2008) as
well as the memoir Poker Face: A Girlhood Among Gamblers (Crown, 2003),
which Publishers Weekly included on its list of the Best Nonfiction Books o=
f
2003 and Esquire Magazine named one of its eight Best Books of the Year
2003.

Noah Eli Gordon is the author of six books, including Novel Pictorial Noise
(Harper Perennial, 2007), which was selected by John Ashbery for the
National Poetry Series. He writes a column on chapbooks for Rain Taxi:
Review of Books and teaches at the University of Colorado Denver.

Noah Eli Gordon's poems take the form of jotted notes in an artist's
notebook (I was reminded in particular of Odilon Redon's). Each day one
begins anew to weave the web, having moved a step forward (or sometimes
backward) since yesterday's attempt. Thus each prose bloc, modified or
modulated by the ghostly fragments that interleave them, sharpens the focus
by which he "attempt[s] via the unknown to give grammar a purpose." The
effort in itself is its own reward, and a prodigal one.
--John Ashbery

In The Heaven-Sent Leaf, Katy Lederer draws on her experience as both
acclaimed younger poet and "brainworker" at a hedge fund in midtown
Manhattan to produce an uncannily prescient work of high lyric. Though on
its surface The Heaven-Sent Leaf addresses that most taboo of
subjects=97money=97what it ultimately confronts is what it means to be, as
Wallace Stevens put it, "finally human."

Behind the storm of daily conflict and crisis, the dramatic confrontations,
the tumult of political struggle, the poet, the artist, the musician,
continues the quiet work of centuries, building bridges of experience
between peoples, reminding man of the universality of his feelings and
desires and despairs, and reminding him that the forces that unite are
deeper than those that divide. -John F. Kennedy

Lawrence Kessenich: Behind the Scenes at Houghton Mifflin.

With Doug Holder


Lawrence Kessenich was an editor at the prestigious Boston publishing hou=
se=20
Houghton Mifflin. Kessenich, 58, attended the MFA program at U/Mass=20
Amherst, lived near Emily Dickinson=92s house, and encountered such poets=
 as:=20
Joe Langland, Donald Junkins, and James Tate. When he didn=92t secure a=20=

teaching assistant position he was forced to drop out and applied to the=20=

Radcliff Publishing Seminar, attending in the summer of 1978. During his =
time=20
at Houghton Mifflin, Kessenich recruited W. P. Kinsella author of =93Shoe=
less=20
Joe,=94 Rick Boyer=92s =93Billingsgate Shoal=94, a mystery that won an Ed=
gar Award for=20
best mystery novel of the year, =93Confessions of Taoist on Wall Street,=94=

by David Payne, and =93Selected Poems of Anne Sexton,=94 edited by Diane=20=

Middlebrook,. Kessenich was the editor for Terry McMillan=92s first book =
=93Mama,=94=20
as well. I spoke with him on my Somerville Community Access TV Show: =93 =
Poet=20
to Poet: Writer to Writer.=94

Doug Holder: After you graduated form the University of Wisconsin in 1974=
,=20
you told me you =93meandered=94 throughout your twenties. What did you do=
? Is=20
meandering a good thing?

Lawrence Kessenich: It was good for me. At the end of college I was=20
interested in the theatre. I started doing amateur theatre. I basically s=
pent=20
my twenties applying to graduate schools. I was accepted into a theatre=20=

program, but at the last minute decided it wasn=92t for me. I was startin=
g to=20
write a lot at that point. I put together some short stories that I had w=
ritten,=20
and applied to 5 or 6 programs. I didn=92t get into any of them. At that =
time I=20
started writing more poetry and so the next time I applied, I applied in =
poetry.=20
I got into three different programs and chose the one at U/Mass Amherst. =
I=20
have always been attracted to Massachusetts. They had a very good program=
=20
at U/Mass. Donald Junkins, was the head of the writing program at that ti=
me.=20
But I ran out of money, and I didn=92t get a teaching assistantship. So I=
 had to=20
leave.

DH: How did you support yourself in your twenties?

LK: I had all sorts of odd jobs. I worked in a hospital and assisted in=20=

autopsies=97that was an interesting experience. I worked at an art supply=
=20
store, a U Haul dealership, etc=85

DH: You attended the Radcliffe Publishing Course in the 70=92s. Was it so=
rt of=20
like a boot camp for getting into the publishing industry?

LK: That=92s a pretty good description. It=92s six weeks and it is very i=
ntense. I=20
went 25 years ago, I think it has been around for sixty years now. They b=
ring=20
in a lot of people from the publishing business, it is just not theoretic=
al. You=20
hear from people who do it on a day-to-day basis. They do some recruiting=
. It=20
does give you contacts in the publishing industry. I almost got a job in =
New=20
York but I decided I couldn=92t live in New York on the salary they offer=
ed. I=20
eventually got the job at Houghton Mifflin from someone I met at the cour=
se.

DH: But you originally wanted to be a writer and now you found yourself o=
n=20
the road to being an editor.

LK: I sort of had an epiphany when I left U/Mass. I thought maybe I was m=
ore=20
suited to be the helper than the person who actually creates the stuff. I=
=20
thought maybe I was more suited to be in the background. It turned out I =
was=20
pretty good at it=85it was a good role for me. But eventually I did want =
to=20
become a writer myself. I did a little, but it is hard when you are an ed=
itor.=20
There are only a handful of people who do it.

DH: William Maxwell of The New Yorker did it.

LK: Yeah and Toni Morrison, Michael Korda.

DH: Did the famous editor of Hemingway and Thomas Wolff, Maxwell Perkins,=
=20
write?

LK: Absolutely not. He was a pure editor. He was sort of my idol.

DH: Your first job at Houghton Mifflin was editorial assistant to Robie=20=

Macauley, a well-known name in the literary world. He was the first serio=
us=20
fiction editor at Playboy. He must have had a few stories from the Mansio=
n,=20
right?

LK: He was there in the 60=92s and was able to pay writers $2,000 a short=
 story.=20
In that era you could live on $6,000 a year. He literally supported, some=
times=20
well-known writers, by publishing two or three of their stories in Playbo=
y. So it=20
was a tremendously powerful position, and he got to know a lot of writers=
=20
very well.

At one time he decided to take a trip to Europe with his wife. The boss=20=

asked: =93 Well, what are you going to do?=94 He replied: =93Well we are =
going here=20
and there. While I am there I am going to visit Nabokov, etc=85=94 He kne=
w all=20
these writers abroad. His boss said=94 Oh, well, we will pay for that.=94=
 They=20
wanted him to maintain contacts with these writers.

DH: You say you had to =93acquire=94 novels in order to get ahead. How do=
es one=20
go about doing that?

LK: Well, for novels or nonfiction=97you basically read articles. When yo=
u are=20
starting out agents won=92t talk to you. So you talk to other people, rea=
d=20
literary magazines, the smaller magazines, where the authors aren=92t=20
necessarily well known. There is a magazine in the publishing trade=20
called: =93Publisher=92s Weekly.=94 I discovered the author W.P. Kinsella=
 who=20
wrote =93Shoeless Joe=94 there. The reviews appear in PW before the book =
is even=20
out. So I happened to read this review of a Canadian anthology of short=20=

stories. There was a one sentence description of Kinsella=92s story: =93 =
An Iowa=20
farmer builds a playing field in his cornfield in order to invoke his bas=
eball hero=20
Shoeless Joe Jackson.=94 It sounded wonderful. I=92m from the Midwest, an=
d I like=20
sports. I was young and na=EFve and I didn=92t know much about publishing=
. I=20
figured that fourteen editors would write to him as soon as they saw it. =
So I=20
decided I was going to write him right away. I asked him if he ever had w=
ritten=20
a novel. Nobody wants to start with short stories. It happens once in a w=
hile=20
but it=92s rare.=20

The Canadian anthology was going to be in the store. And this will give y=
ou an=20
idea how little money you make in publishing: I was so poor I didn=92t fe=
el I could=20
buy the book, so I went into a bookstore in Harvard Square and read the=20=

he had ever written, which at that time were two books of short stories, =

the=20
original short story. This was the story that became =93Shoeless Joe,=94 =
and the=20
subsequent movie =93Field of Dreams.=94 He had an idea about baseball sto=

go from there. He responded: =93 No, I don=92t want to do that.=94 He had=
 another=20
way he wanted to write it. So about three months later I get about ninety=
=20
pages of the novel. And honestly, it was terrible. It felt like it wasn=92=

I think it is now shifted to the agents. They now get the slush pile.

We know the uses of adjectives. If anyone has doubts about the what the
modifier "Nigerian" is doing in "Nigerian scams", that person can pick a
good grammar book and crosscheck. Moreover, we are talking about language as

Nico,

Very powerful work. I am especially intrigued by "from textorn" and "staring
index", and "in other words, you see", relating, I suppose, to the organic
fluidity in those pieces. Thanks for the look...

You are right in preferring "con artist" to "con man", for gender reasons.
But I would like you to publish the first 419 email sent from Nigeria on
this list, to prove that the use of email in conning originated from
Nigeria.

I taught in Nigeria for two years way way back. I am still in close contact=
 with former Nigerian students, and friends from the time. I personally get=
 offended when I hear "Nigerian scam" or variations on that. For a moment, =
when it became vogue-ish to indulge that characterization, it gave me the i=
mpression that the whole country had been taken over by these Internet wiel=
ding scam 'artists' - which I just as suddenly was stupid and highly prejud=
icial, dismissive, etc.=20

Maybe human nature? Maybe most countries are looking at the USA and reducin=
g us down to a cast of greedy unscrupulous banker/mortgage broker/ real est=
ate predators??=20

Nigeria - its pleasures and real disturbances (corrupt practices by some in=
cluded) is much more interesting country than that easy reductive=A0 'scam'=
 slight.=A0 =A0=20

Humorously, the Nigerian students on the Nsukka campus where I taught, woul=
d call, in Pidgin English, the few Albino students "Peace Corpsees."=A0 (No=
, I did not interpet that to mean I was a 'dead man walking'!)

Better than a "Bushie" - I suspect.=20

I thought this was pretty interesting:
"A Documentary Saga of the Oulipo"
http://infinityskitchen.com/blog/oulipo-documentar

three videos.

nothing you wouldn't get from a reading of the oulipo compendium, but there
it is in video on the web very easy.

the constraint, not the application of the constraint.

more interested in potential/poetential literature than in the application
of the constraint, i.e., 'the thing itself'.

i think that's at the core of it.

a very useful idea/aesthetic.

to me, that's 'conceptual literature' in the best sense of that term.

not exactly 'content is king'.

unless we think of the content of the concept. then it is. but in a very
different way.

the content of the concept?

yes, everything it implies and all its atmospheres. is it a one-liner or
does it have roots and legs and generative fecundity.

ja

When one loads Second Life, servers and bandwidth, not to mention
your local machine, might slow things up; the image passes from
incomplete to the masquerade of a replete and fecund world. Here
are a few examples:

http://www.alansondheim.org/rush1.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/rush2.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/rush3.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/rush4.jpg
http://www.alansondheim.org/rush5.jpg

It's the reverse of the hypnagogic, beginning with the blank slate
of antiquated neurophysiology, ending with an ostensible real that
is equally within the imaginary. You see this out of the corner of
your eye, all the time; you don't quite trust yourself, trust your
vision.

"Shattering a moment of intimacy - for me, the Net doesn't do it, I long
for real intimacy beyond this space the longer I'm on-line, closeness,
pressure, of the body against the keys, the intimacy which is touch, the
intimacy of nest, domus, place. Love is the occasion of all, the light
itself floats, transforming the world of intimacy into the weight or
intimacy of the screen - nothing, in short, that is desirable - intimacy
may result after all. But the activity is very different, like formation,
the hunt, the studied mannerist intimacy of speaking, drugging, posses-
sion, the contract. Intimacy forestalls occupation, the experiential. The
writing should be the exposure of every intimacy and secret, should be
exposure, of intimacy, every secret intimacy the secret should shout all
self, the vanishing- point, plane and punctum."

It's called a Nigerian scam, the way French Fries, which are
considerably more dangerous, are called French Fries. Unlike French
Fries, the scam really did originate in the country for which it's
named, though of course now they come from everywhere. I guess
there's no justice.

One solution would be to avoid all vocalizations beyond grunts, tho
even grunts may be taken by someone somewhere as offensive.

Here's the wikipedia entry on Advance Fee Fraud (also known as 419
fraud, Nigerian scam, Nigerian bank scam, Nigerian money offer, the
Spanish Prisoner, the Black money scam, Russian/Ukrainian scam) with
plenty of references.  Since it began in the early 80s I'm pretty sure
the first examples were postal rather than electronic.

Nurse handed over $400,000 to web scam despite FBI warning


Bobbie Johnson in San Francisco=20
guardian.co.uk, Saturday November 15 2008 00.01 GMT=20
The Guardian, Saturday November 15 2008=20
=C2=A0

An American woman has revealed how she was swindled out of $400,000 (=C2=A3=
269,000) by Nigerian internet fraudsters, in what is believed to be one of =
the biggest cases of its kind ever recorded.
Janella Spears, a registered nurse from Sweet Home, Oregon, said she starte=
d sending money to the scammers in 2005 after she received an email promisi=
ng her several million dollars from a long-lost relative. In what is common=
ly known as a 419 scam - named after a section of the Nigerian criminal cod=
e - the fraudsters randomly contacted Spears over the internet, claiming th=
ey would offer her a substantial cut of $20.5m fortune in return for the ca=
sh injection which would help move it out of the country.
"I kept thinking it's only a couple hundred dollars - I can get it back," s=
he told local news. Over a period of two years, the fraudsters strung her a=
long and encouraged her to send more payments of up to $14,000 at a time. I=
n the end she became obsessed and sent the fraudsters more than $400,000, w=
hich she raised by remortgaging her home and spending her husband's retirem=
ent savings.
Despite advice from bank officials, police and even the FBI that the scheme=
 was a ruse, Spears said she continued to send cash in the hope of a large =
pay-off. Even fake emails claiming to be from the President of Nigeria and =
US president George Bush could not dissuade her.
"I said how come you're using this non-government address? 'Oh, because our=
 computer has a worm'," she said. The 419 fraud is one of the most common i=
nternet deceptions, and like most similar schemes is reliant on sending mil=
lions of spam messages in the hope that they land in the inbox of a gullibl=
e victim.
Although finding victims requires luck rather than judgement, the incredibl=
y low cost of sending email means that such fraud can be highly profitable.=
 A study by researchers at University of California showed that it took an =
average of 12.5m spam emails for each response - but that large operations =
sending billions of messages could make as much as =C2=A32m a year.=20
Although Spears is an exception she is far from being alone. Last year Brit=
ish police helped crack a similar fraud ring, which was holding fake cheque=
s worth more than =C2=A31bn, which had links to groups in the Netherlands a=
nd Nigeria.
Although it is difficult to calculate the value of such swindles because ma=
ny victims are too embarrassed to report the crime, the government has esti=
mated that such frauds could cost =C2=A33.5bn a year in Britain alone.
Spears claimed she was sharing her story now in order to prevent others fro=
m falling victim to similar scams. "You're sitting there going 'how can I f=
all for something like that'," she said.

We know the uses of adjectives. If anyone has doubts about the what the
modifier "Nigerian" is doing in "Nigerian scams", that
person can pick a
good grammar book and crosscheck. Moreover, we are talking about language a=
s
"loaded weapon" here, and as Dwight Bolinger says, what is even more
dangerous is to assume that such a weapon is innocuous!

selective in what we choose to post. Queries for contact info,
messages intended for just a few subscribers, messages that are not on
topic, "flame" messages, and free-standing personal poems or journal
entries will, in general, not be forwarded to the list.

June 2008: Refocused List Policy
In line with our editorial focus, we do not automatically post
submissions but select those we think are most useful for sustaining
this online community. We appreciate all submissions, but will be more
selective in what we choose to post. Queries for contact info,
messages intended for just a few subscribers, messages that are not on
topic, "flame" messages, and free-standing personal poems or journal
entries will, in general, not be forwarded to the list.

1. Posting to the List

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of
form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible. While we recognize that other
lists may sponsor other possibilities for exchange, we request that
those participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focused nature of this project and respect our decision to operate a
moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support and encourage
divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to doing what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Posts are limited to list
subscribers. All messages are reviewed by the editors in keeping with
the goals of the list as articulated in this Welcome Message. The
listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for discussion
and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow listserv
policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

Please note that this list is primarily concerned with discussions of
poetry and poetics. We strongly encourage subscribers to post
information, including web links, relating to publications (print and
internet), reading series, and blogs that they have coordinated,
edited or published, or in which they appear. Such announcements
constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Queres for contact info, messages intended
for just a few subscribers, "flame" messages, and free-standing
personal poems or journal entries will, in general, not be forwarded
to the list.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers. Personal queries and off-topic submissions will not be
posted.

Send messages directly to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


2. About the Poetics List

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has over 1500 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).

Please also note that this is a not a general interest poetry list and
information about this list should not be posted to directories of
poetry lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific engagement related to the list's stated orientation.

In addition to being archived through the EPC and at the UB Listerv
archive, some posts to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices,
announcements, etc.) may also become part of specific EPC subject
areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also online at the
EPC.

3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email us at poetics.list --at -- gmail.com, subject-line
"registration," with your full name, street address, email address,
and telephone number. Failure to register at the time of subscription
will result in automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed from the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.

6. Cautions

In moderating this list, the editors must consider sometimes competing
interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with our
collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

All posts not only go out to list subscribers but also become a public
part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is
a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you
formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being
indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to
remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine
indexing of these posts.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

Note: Private correspondence via email and letters are always (c) the
author and may not be reproduced in whole or in part without the
written permission of the author. As a general rule, we will not
publish posts that include such material unless they indicate that
permission has been given.

We request that posters limit the number of posts they send to the
list on any given day. Given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 75
or fewer messages per day, though these paramenters may be changed at
the discretion of the list moderator.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics.list@gmail.com>.

7. Flaming
"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This, of course, includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
or criticism of the person.

dear stephen, i'm really glad you wrote this response.  i've had similar
experiences in hawai'i, and i know it's particularly hard to see one's own
slant when it's in the face.  i so often meet people who just want to go
to hawai'i and think they're being called there and completely don't
understand the impact of all the non-hawaiians pouring in and taking over
land, spirituality, water, etc.  it's very hard for hawaiians to make a go
of it in/on their own land because it's so beautiful and such an intense
place that it just seems "right" for all of us to want to be in paradise.
no paradise when thousands of hawaiians are homeless, living on the
beaches and in the parks, and the military rules over all.  there's a huge
diaspora too--both to places like vegas and in mainland prisons.  yuk.
anyway, it's easy to overlook what it feels like for the people who are
inside the characterization we're making for them/of them.  maybe "it's
just an adjective"--but so what?  if it feels like a stab because of all
colonial past and present history, tis so.  what's to justify?  blessings,
g

i am wondering how real these budget shortfalls/deficits are.  maggie
thatcher did a lot to destroy the socialist support system in england.  i
don't think she claimed they were going bankrupt if they kept the system
sound, though.  these claims of impending financial doom, etc., for some
reason make me think that there's support system destruction going on, not
because of financial doom but because we're being jacked back into the
oligarchy jack london was writing about in _the iron heel_.  nasty
thought, but it keeps popping into my mind.  all best, gabe

Jim,

This way any poem is reduced to a statement describing the process which
will produce it. The concept itself, the concept itself as potential, rather
than its actualization, is the poem. This way what is infinite in potential,
becomes infinitely concise.

Do you mean something like this Jim?

Ciao,

Murat

I wanna say that a certain level of parochialism comes out in these most recent responses to Obododimma's reply. Just think about what this first term means for a second.

Next, I wanna say that given George's almost fetishizing of the expression "USAmerican," I'm more than bit surprised at both his reaction and tone, and most certainly because he has almost demanded that we take note of his own sensitivitiy (as, apparently, an other).

While I do not think it my responsibility to be overly concerned about anyone's sensitivities, certainly any more than to presuppose the credibility/reliability of narrative, I do, however, think it important to listen. Without engaging in one-up-manship, I have NEVER been called anything but an American in my extensive travels (which is to say, at least privately, I think these folks pushing this expression are harping on a non-issue. Can I say: "harping"). But, and this is my point, I have managed to listen.

I think I said something about listening and parochialism - to repeat
the purpose of my post with deference. The fact that in 30 countries,
including those visited in South and Central America, six of the 30 in
which I have lived and worked, aged 39, today in China, not anyone has
ever called me a USAmerican does not displease me - esp given the
Western hemisphere was merely a playground for colonialism during the
creation of the US and the nation state. I don't mind being called
something else, certainly - Yank works...Kiwi, too, but then it has
already been taken, and so has Canadian.





It seems disturbing, getting back to my point, that three things have been missed among the remarks made:





1- Obododimm's remark informs and doesn't warrant such attacks (Hey,
how about we call those in the US warmongers, Jesus freaks,
Frankenstinian, know-it-alls with no capacity to control their
arrogance, spiritually fat...because it seems true, at least in most
superficial way. Then, too, we could make some nasty generalizations
related to white folks - about how they tend to think they have the right to
talk for or talk down to --)





2- That David could have written that e-mail (and I have known him for
more than 15 years). I suppose we'll hear from him soon.




3- By being so parochial, you are basically shaping
discourse to meet your own needs, not that of a greater literary
community that extends outside. Too, we don't always know what we need.



Best,

Alex

So..with all the "harping," which "harping" is preferred, the harping support or harping condemnation of the term?

I think if you look back at my initial post, you'll see that my intention
was to argue the point that the term wasn't meant to offend, and wasn't
offensive, though taking into account that we are bound to disagree. Most
here have lived and visited other countries for what I'm sure are extensive
periods of time, and thus know what being both a social and racial minority
might be like. Many of these same travelers have probably found themselves
part of marginalized communities of any kind, and might understand the
problem of grouping, stereotyping and prejudice -- with firsthand knowledge
that it really does hurt all involved, of course, when we find that our dear
friends are the brunt of any type of colonialist (or any other type)
subjugation through language. I don't think anyone here would disagree. In
that regard, it's unnecessary to point out that Americans are often slurred
in other countries. This, in fact, shows the ignorance of many that claim to
be superior to Americans. Nevertheless, this is a different matter
altogether, as it would be if we called all Nigerians "scam email writers";
however, being called a warmonger implies that a person is actively involved
or supportive of a call to war, and thus it seems reductive to claim that
all Americans, just by the token of their being Americans, are warmongers.

But terming a response as "shaping discourse" allows you to respond and thus
"shape discourse" while dismissing, or giving others reasons to dismiss, the
comments they feel "shape discourse" in a way that they don't want it
shaped. I'm all for shaping the discourse, as long as others have that same
latitude. And they do, and have, shaped it. I won't claim the conversation
is legit only when it goes the way I feel is fair and just.

But this conversation so far relates to emails, spam and scam in the form of
the 419 letter. Whether David composed this letter or not is moot: it's what
got the discussion going...parochial or otherwise. And so...the 419 Letter:


As 419 is a term that refers to the law in the Nigerian criminal code. Since
there was a need to create this code in Nigeria, it seems there was a
problem there with email scams. Never has anyone stated that all scams or
cons have come from Nigeria. This would be silly. But...since it's 419
Letters we're talking about and since these letters come from Nigeria...we
either call them Nigerian email scams, 419 Letters, or the less specific and
much less accurate, scam emails.

Call it what you want. The syntax and goal of the email is the same, no
matter where the letters originates. But at least we know what criminal code
they're breaking in Nigeria...

I wasn't attempting to make a statement about 'any poem', really, =20
Murat. I doubt that what I said applies well to 'any poem' but, =20
rather, to a certain approach to poetry. In the same way that =20
statements about conceptual art, say, might not apply very well to =20
other types of art.

I don't think it's a matter of reducing poems to statements describing =20
the processes which produced them. Instead, it's a matter of =20
introducing a dimension to poetry which is interesting and, once =20
understood and appreciated, allows people to enjoy various classes of =20
poetry that, before, may have seemed deficient by other standards. For =20
instance, N+7, simply as a text unto itself, without reference to not =20
only the process that produced it but its place in history and why it =20
has that place in history, might seem to enjoy notoriety without =20
merit. As though what has merit must fulfill the criteria of the poemy =20
poem devoid of concept, in this sense. Which, itself, can be viewed as =20
a reduction of poetry, a refusal of dimensions such as the conceptual.

It needn't be one or the other, of course. They aren't really articles =20
of faith.

We have been reading such narratives, Barry. Two things you need to know:
both the American lady (Janeila Spears) and the con artists are united in a
criminal attempt at enriching themselves. The con artists (as tricksters --
I take a folkloric approach to the narrative) merely succeeded in outwittin=
g
Spears. If I were a judge, I would certainly give spears a sentence. Second=
,
there is the role of the mediation of this kind of narrative, and perhaps a=
n
attempt to harvest from existing narratives that conform to the Western ide=
a
of what constitutes "news" from the periphery, specifically the Third World=
.
This orientation in global reporting has been studied extensively, but
perhaps you may wish to read Johann Galtung.

We are scholars and we need to analyze these narratives for what they may b=
e
worth, and not consume them like the ordinary public.

Obododimma.

I sent the mail below directly to Tom Savage, but would like to share it
with members on the list, because I am concerned with how some of us who use
web-based mail become vulnerable to scammers.
Regards to all.
Obododimma.
-----------------------

Hello Tom,
I have just returned to Namibia after a week-long conference in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil. We will explore this issue further much later. It may
interest you that I have been keeping most of those scam mails in a folder,
hoping to do a more extended study of the criminal rhetoric that they
represent. I received the scam mail in question three years ago from Turkey,
and was asked to send money to Dr Mustapha, a Sudanese scholar I met at a
conference in Gabon. The narrative is the same: he is stranded in Turkey and
I should quickly send him some dollars! Mustapha and I became close friends
when we met at that conference because I was impressed at the way he
analyzed and criticized the Sudanese junta. So, I was almost tempted to run
to his rescue but had to analyze the mail and tried to get in touch with
him. A day later, a Chinese scholar who attended that conference wrote,
telling me he got a similar mail from Mustapha. I was able to get in touch
with Mustapha and found that he did not send the mail and did not even have
access to his mail account.

As you would see, that mail did not come from Africa or Nigeria. There are a
number of cyber-oriented con artists out there (Africans, Americans, Asians,
etc) who use all kinds of tricks to gain access to web-based mails. One
major way is that of sending encrypted web-links inviting you to this or
that web membership or free service. Once you click, your account becomes
vulnerable.

Many of us do not seem to recognize that web-based emails are particularly
insecure and we are sometimes carried away by the desire to be part of many
things hapening on the web. David should count himself lucky that it was not
a case of his account being used to send a mail oriented to terrorist
activity! He would have had a lot to explain to the police!

I need to take a shower and sleep off the jet lag.

Regards,
Obododimma.

Thank you especially to all who wrote me directly in the last week and also=
 to all those who wrote indirectly on the issues which came out of the lett=
er of appeal from the hacked address of "david chirot."

I am very stunned and thankful to all for such concern and interest.  It is=
 deeply moving as it is a living sign of  a community which has been create=
d by its members through time and writing=2C which is the art of space/time=
 travel.

If any of us were in any "elsewhere" whether by hacker or no--there would b=
e again such a response.

To me this awareness of community and companionship revealed by of al thing=
s a hacker indeed a very beaitufl event to be thankful for.

I apologize in a previous letter I conveyed the opposite impression--as I w=
rote then=2C I had arrived back here from a day in the clinic and the next =
several days and today still not in such good shape so it has taken longer =
than ever to essay reading the mails and attempting replies.  In that condi=
tion=2C the only letter I had really looked at was the one from my son.

The anaolgy I made previously with Rimbaud however one I think can make a p=
oem or prose poem with--the "reports" of Rimbaud that circulated in Paris d=

Please take a look at the call for submissions below, and visit the
website/blog for the new publication _Whiskey & Fox_.  (
http://whiskeyandfox.blogspot.com )

Thanks

Daniel C Remein and Editors


Whiskey & Fox now accepts unsolicited submissions of poetry and theory. We
are not interested in work in facile relation to the conditions of its
production or its political function, but in work that attempts to provoke
configurations of secular human community as alternatives to those of
Capital and its States. To this end, we are not interested in writing that
pretends to operate within a single repeatable mode, restricting possible
imaginings of future humanisms and post-humanisms and the possibility for
producing queer-heterotopoi. As such, we are interested in poetry and
poetics committed to theory and historiography, and theory and
historiography committed to poetry and poetics. The journal is interested
currently in shorter forms or fragments, forms which might be classified as
a missive, an aphorism, or a raid--although other forms and modes will be
considered.

Specifically, for the next issue, we announce an interest in work that will
fit under the title "Doing Politics with Animals."  The issue will include a
response to all of the work collected within the same volume by Karl Steel
(Asst. Professor CUNY Brooklyn), historian and theorist of the human/animal
boundary between the medieval and the contemporary.

Please send submissions to whiskeyandfox [at] gmail [dot] com in a MS Word
document, unless the work involves a specific non-standard typography or
layout (in which case, please send a PDF). The filename should include your
last name. You may send a cover letter, and we will not be unhappy about it.
Send unpublished work only, please. Simultaneous submissions are not a
problem, but please notify us right away if the work is published
elsewhere.

was a dust-caked

I poured the champagne
into the pot
and watched
the bubbles
rush to the surface
before I could even
turn on the heat.

It was impossible to tell
whether or not
it was
boiling;

impossible to tell
whether it was time
to move on.

Dear Friends and Readers,

The Splinter Generation, by popular demand, is now offering chapbooks for
sale online at www.splintergeneration.com/teedonation.html

I heard from lots of people who want to read the stories and poetry of the
Splinter Generation in book form. We listened. Now all of the content is
available in a chapbook that was designed by the talented Kristina Kaiser.
These chapbooks also make great presents for the holidays; you can give
people some great stories and poems to read while supporting young writers.
The little money we will raise from the sale of these chapbooks will go
towards further publicity -- and an exciting development we'll  announce at
the beginning of next year.

We also now have an official facebook and myspace page, and despite my
promise to never, ever have a Twitter account, we're on Twitter, too. Become
a fan or a friend! And tell your friends to become fans or friends. Follow
us on Twitter! Help us see what you all are doing by letting us follow you
on Twitter. Spread the word!

ISBN: 9780977901975
Prose Poetry.=20
5"x7", 136 pages, perfectbound, t=EAte-b=EAche
$14 includes shipping in the US

BODY LANGUAGE, a book of poetry unique both in content and design,
investigates the body in language and language in the body. It is a =
diptych
of sorts, two full-length collections of prose poems (PRIMER and BODY) =
which
meet in the middle. True to its content, the book design (called
=93t=EAte-b=EAche=94), employs two front covers and no back cover. =
=93With its trope
of clue-like instruction and unique, flip-book embodiment,=94 writes =
Lisa Russ
Spahr, BODY LANGUAGE =93creates a kind of hybrid detective f(r)iction, =
an
intrepid mash-up of high and low cultures in which the reader is as =
likely
to encounter Rilke and Proto-Sinaitic inscription as Lacan, Film Noir, =
The
Three Stooges, cell phones, higher mathematics, binary thought. . . .=94 =



FOREVER NO LO
by Teresa K. Miller
Chapbook. Poetry.
4" x 4.75", saddle-sewn, french flaps, 36 pages
$10 includes shipping in the US=20

Vehicular homicide, relationship dissolution by imperceptible degrees,
genocide, terror by war, linguistic disorientation, all meet in Teresa =
K.
Miller=92s chapbook, FOREVER NO LO. As evidenced by its cover, a =
palimpsest of
maps, the setting of FOREVER NO LO is at once Portugal, East Oakland,
Rwanda, Chicago, Iraq. . . . In multivocal language fragments of broken
Portuguese, elementary French, and dialectical English, this serial poem
asks what comes of global and personal tragedy=97what grows, haunts, =
decays,
redeems=97in the gut, on the news, or from local communities. Printed =
and
hand-bound in Vermont, FOREVER NO LO is a limited edition of 150.


THE INLAND SEA
by Brandon Shimoda
Chapbook. Poetry.
6" x 8", perfectbound, black endsheets, 40 pages.
November 2008.

Also limited to 150 copies is TSky Press=92s first perfectbound =
chapbook,
Brandon Shimoda=92s THE INLAND SEA. A remembrance, and a =
thinking-through, of
the grand and generative compromises of birth, migration, dementia,
sacrifice and ancestor worship, THE INLAND SEA is a raveling entreaty =
for
the life of both a family departed and a family spectrally present.
Spiritually addressed to Midori Shimoda, as well as to the inland =
seascapes
of his birth (Hiroshima, Japan) and death (Lake Norman, North Carolina), =

It's not that "scamming" is a Nigerian thing.  The term refers to a very
specific type of scam because the first wave of these type of emails way
back when came from -- or were said to come from -- Nigeria.  Hence this
particular type of email scam has come to be known as the Nigerian scam.  If
you look at the headers on these type of emails, they actually almost never
come from the country they claim to be from--very often you'll get one that
claims to come from an African country but has a Russian or Italian email
domain.  But anyway, that's where the term comes from and on urban legends
and scam websites, these emails are known officially there as the Nigerian
scam.

Hi Barry,
I feel seriously hurt by your use of the term "*Nigerian* scams"! What makes
you think that scamming is a Nigerian thing? Perhaps you need to read the
history of scamming, if you have not done so. People like Al Capone and
other well known crooks practised conmanship in America many decades before
what came to be known as 419 in Nigeria emerged.

I have a fair knowledge of the history of conmanship in America (as a
criminologist!), but cannot talk of "American scam", unless I mean to insult
that great country. I think we need to be careful in the way we criminalize
and stereotype other societies. Or is that not part of the netiquette at
POETICS?
Be well!

Thanks, Gabrielle. The ironic thing about the use of the "Nigerian scam" is=
 the way the phrase can put=A0 the blinder on all the Euro-American scams i=
n Nigeria, the worst being the Chevron and the Shell Oil "Scams" that have =
done so much damage on all levels to the people and the environment of the =
Delta Regions, let alone to manipuate and corrupt the various levels of the=
 Nigerian Government.=A0=A0 I suspect much more of the 'Internet's imaginat=
ion' has been 'righteously' focused on the "Nigerian Scams" and much less o=
n the Shell-Chevron Scams.=20

dear stephen, i'm really glad you wrote this response.  i've had similar
experiences in hawai'i, and i know it's particularly hard to see
one's own
slant when it's in the face.  i so often meet people who just want to go
to hawai'i and think they're being called there and completely
don't
understand the impact of all the non-hawaiians pouring in and taking over
land, spirituality, water, etc.  it's very hard for hawaiians to make a go
of it in/on their own land because it's so beautiful and such an intense
place that it just seems "right" for all of us to want to be in
paradise.
no paradise when thousands of hawaiians are homeless, living on the
beaches and in the parks, and the military rules over all.  there's a huge
diaspora too--both to places like vegas and in mainland prisons.  yuk.
anyway, it's easy to overlook what it feels like for the people who are
inside the characterization we're making for them/of them.  maybe
"it's
just an adjective"--but so what?  if it feels like a stab because of all
colonial past and present history, tis so.  what's to justify?  blessings,
g

I have to say that, finally, I feel physically ill from the feeling of havi=

 has been talk of language as a loaded weapon and of people feeling stabbed=
 by how they are characterized. Well, I feel like I am on the receiving end=
 of those things. I don't to get into a contest of sensitivities but=C2=A0i=

Ryan Daley's argument in the following excerpt from his previous post has
caught my attention:

"As 419 is a term that refers to the law in the Nigerian criminal code.
Since
there was a need to create this code in Nigeria, it seems there was a
problem there with email scams. Never has anyone stated that all scams or
cons have come from Nigeria. This would be silly. But...since it's 419
Letters we're talking about and since these letters come from Nigeria...we
either call them Nigerian email scams, 419 Letters, or the less specific and
much less accurate, scam emails."

I would like Daley to know that just as HIV/AIDS has names in Nigerian
languages (with interesting derivations and patterns), what is named 419
also has names in many other languages of the world. Some Nigerians simply
started referring to the crime by the name of the law that was enacted to
crush it. It was there even before email became available to the public, way
beyond the colonial period . Law enforcement agents used to refer to it (and
some still do) as "OBT", which means "Obtaining Goods by Tricks." Every
society or language has its interesting ways it manages etymology and
synecdoche. If a society prefers to call something by another thing
associated with it, it would be an oversimplification to conclude that that
type of experience only has to do with that society (or even started in that
society). There are certainly other ways of naming the crime in other
societies, and if we study those, we may find that they predate the
internet. Not even Benjamin Lee Whorf with his hypothesis on linguistic
relativity and linguistic determinism would conclude quickly that because
there is a Nigerian law that people optionally use in identifying the crime,
then it is a typical Nigerian semiotic or problem.

To choose to call it  "Nigerian scams" or "Nigerian email scams" is to
engage in the politics of labelling. Ok, why not the option "419 mails"? My
friend, lexical choice, especially with adjectives, has a lot to do with
attitude. Are those attitudes harmful or harmless? Now, don't tell me that
writers do not consider facework in their diction. Such a writer that
ignores facework is certainly not a "righer". Just part of the crowd.

An important part of the mail I sent to Tom (which I felt would benefit
other people on this list) was lost. Here is it below:
--------------------
As you would see, that mail did not come from Africa or Nigeria. There are a
number of cyber-oriented con artists out there (Africans, Americans, Asians,
etc) who use all kinds of tricks to gain access to web-based mails. One
major way is that of sending encrypted web-links inviting you to this or
that web membership or free service. Once you click, your account becomes
vulnerable.

Many of us do not seem to recognize that web-based emails are particularly
insecure and we are sometimes carried away by the desire to be part of many
things hapening on the web. David should count himself lucky that it was not
a case of his account being used to send a mail oriented to terrorist
activity! He would have had a lot to explain to the police!

Regards to all.

Jim,

What I was trying to say was:

a) whether these conceptual constructs themselves develop a tradition among
them, actually becoming a new kind of poem, protecting the ideal (potential)
rather than the real (actual).

b) Conceptual, more precisely process poems, have a tendency, as far as I
can see, of leading to a huge number of poems, a thousand, two thousand,
etc. This creates a crisis of reading them, basically, they become
"unreadable," only conceivable, unless one is ready to spend an eternity on
each word. Converting the poem into its concept -conceiving its yet
undefined possibilities, which actually generated the activity in the first
place- condenses this problem of relentless quantity into its essence.

Ciao,

Murat

David, your experience parallels one which seems, at least in part, to be h=
appening in my court as well. I wrote a devil of a poem earlier today, to a=
ttack any spies or thieves: "Crazed! The $19.95 James Beach Writing Academy=
. 'WE EAT THE MEAT & GIVE YOU THE PUDDING'." That way, any hackers that hap=
pen along to my personal computer can drool, in contemplation of good and e=
vil, before acting.=20

We ask, How else to defeat an enemy except to try and hack inside their min=
d(s)? A military man's and a philosopher's tactic, sure. But a poet's? Are =
poets supposed to be Christ-like in turning the other cheek? or are poets c=
unning daredevils whose pens are mightier than. What is "poet"? What is "po=
etics"? Are certain words "key," trite, buzzed out, property of certain ind=
ividuals, free for all? Breaking into print is like cracking a safe-- some =
can write fetching prose or verse, and some need to hack into other peoples=
' safes to get any material. I think it's safe to say most everyone in the =
Poetics community is among the former.

Why anyone would ever steal another's work and/or identity, in pursuit of p=
laying the romanticized poet, is perplexing. Karmic energy-attachments to s=
tolen things can triple in energy, I hear. Curses, etc. Thanks for sharing,=
 best of luck, keep us updated. Write on.

KWH Art, the English
Department, & the Creative Writing Program
present

an opening for TAPEWORM
a collaborative exhibition based on Darren Wershler-Henry's
"The Tapeworm Foundry (andor the dangerous prevalence of imagination)"

Thursday, 11/20 at 7PM
the Writers House | 3805 Locust Walk
No registration required - free & open to the public
------------------------------

----------------------

Tapeworm is a collaboration of art projects radiating from a writing piece by Canadian artist Darren Wershler-Henry, "The Tapeworm Foundry (andor the dangerous prevalence of imagination)."/ /The text is available on UbuWeb: <http://www.ubu.com/ubu/wershler_tapeworm.html>http://www.ubu.com/ubu/wershler_tapeworm.html. The Tapeworm Foundry is an intriguing instance of conceptual writing, faithfully formulaic but also unusually compelling in its fruition: a single rambling, unpunctuated sequence of possible projects, ranging from quirky to absurd to highly ambiguous and all largely allusive of the twentieth century avant-garde. The potential 'instructions' that comprise Tapeworm, linked by the pulsating conjunction 'andor', are themselves mini-premises for a thousand other projects, making the 50-page list the ultimate conceptual catalyst.

This exhibition challenges a group of young contemporary artists and writers at Penn to realize some of Wershler-Henry's hypothetical instructions. The Penn students and graduates participating in the exhibition include: Grace Ambrose, Joyce Lee, Ned Eisenberg, Vladimir Zykov, Kimberly Eisler, Artie Vierkant, John Carroll, Jamie-Lee Josselyn, Arielle Brousse, Manya Scheps, Brooke Palmieri, Nick Salvatore, Robin McDowell, Sofie Hodara, Cecilia Corrigan, and Thomson Guster, with assistance from James La Marre and Trisha Low. Curated by Kaegan Sparks. There will be a limited quantity of complimentary exhibition catalogues available at the opening. Please email <mailto:kwhart@writing.upenn.edu>kwhart@writing.upenn.edu <mailto:<mailto:kwhart@writing.upenn.edu>kwhart@writing.upenn.edu> for more information.

This event will be webcast live: the Kelly Writers House LIVE WEBCAST allows you to join us at KWH as a virtual participant. Stop by online for a poetry reading or a discussion with a major journalist, regardless of whether you live in Philadelphia or in London. You can tune into each live webcast by following the instructions on the KWH-TV page: <http://writing.upenn.edu/wh/webcasts/instructions.html>http://writing.upenn.edu/wh/webcasts/instructions.html.

Point taken. Though, my concern here is namely with English and how the
adjective, be it 419 or Nigerian, causes assumptions about the referent. Yo=
u
state below, and I'd agree, that by saying 419 we are OBTing the crime,
we're euphemistically obscuring the action. But is the adjective describing
a permanent or temporal action, and does that matter?

So, here comes the test: Does the world think less of Nigeria with the
overuse of this adjective? Yes. The overuse turns into something similar to
a snowclone: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowclone.
And that's where the real offense comes in...not in the "feelings" of a few=
,
but in the tearing-down ability of words, when employed incorrectly, to
appeal to the lazy part of us to sum up entire nations/races/regions/sports
teams. Hence, blaming Barry for the initial statement, as if he were the
sole cause of the offense, seems petty. Certain Barry didn't invent 419
Letters, nor the term "Nigerian email scam." Our arguing the term, while
certain tiresome by now, is what should happen with each problematization o=
f
language. =BFNo es cierto?

The notions of conceptual art or conceptual poetry, however different from
one another, should be distinguished from the notion of the process poem or
process art. Basically, the former focusses on concept, the latter on
process. The former can be without special interest in process and the
latter can be without special interest in the conceptual.

The Oulipo is conceptual in that they are more interested in the constraint
than instances of realized texts. Similar to how a meta-mathematician might
be more interested in the properties of formal systems in general than the
properties of any particular formal system. Or the way that a poet might be
more interested in poetics than poems.

Many would then say the creature's a critic or something not a poet. Until
faced with a Derrida or someone in that vein and of that quality. Similarly
in math the mathematicians, when faced with Godel's work, which is more meta
than the foundational level (i.e., it's *about* the foundations, not
foundational), begin to see that *doing mathematics* can be practiced
significantly at the meta level.

The Oulipo is 'processual' in that they seem
mainly interested in constraint-based, generative or processual creations.

It's certainly a different type of reading. One of course is not
obliged or asked to read thousands of texts but to get some sense of the
range and nature of the generative capacity of the process.

One is asked to read between the lines toward the big picture.

Scat Songs by Lawrence Upton
based on a text by Chris Funkhouser

from the introduction:

Almost everything, over and above the initial tearing, trampling and
tangling of the image was done by me, quite deliberately, as I used
the copier, by breaking with common sense and / or the copier's
manual. At that stage, very little was produced and very little was
thrown away. The initial run of images ran to 31, which was cut down
to 24 by selection; and , of the remaining 24, 11 were changed by
tearing away unwanted material before being recopied. Xerolage 41 -
Lawrence UptonThe aim was to get as near as possible to an
improvisation in real time. The second session was much shorter. This
time, I had 11 sheets; each had an attached note with a brief action-
prompt. The copier made the 11 copies and that was that. The two sets
of finished images were then sorted together. The title, Scat Songs,
came late.

What I aimed for, retrospectively, in Scat Songs was to get 24 varying
images with 24 presses of the <copy> button. 42 presses isn't bad.
Maybe I'll improve on that in make any future copier poem.

Yet such an improvement would not necessarily make the result
aesthethically better or worse. It's just a constraint, like any
other, to encourage concentration, a taking of structural form into
poetic procedures, which I tilt.

I agree with Mark. I would be very sorry to see Barry Schwabsky go away fro=
m
this list, he is one of the most sensitive and intelligent contributors.
Something similar happened to me once while queuing up at the canteen at
university (eons ago). A guy whom I hadn't seen for ages screamed out:
"Anny, we haven't seen you for a while!"
To which I answered back: "I have been working like a negro..."
And a black guy jumped up, "How do negroes work?"
I felt like answering as *Turks smoke*, which would have triggered a
senseless chain of ethnic insanity. I thus apologized, even if as Mark says=
,
sayings are sayings and they belong to the general culture. I was the one
who was working, and no one else.

Liesl Olson: Gertrude Stein=92s Habits
Classics 110
1010 E. 59th St.
Chicago, IL 60637

Reception to follow.

Gertrude Stein locates habit=97rather than innovation=97as the most =20
animating force in the English literary tradition. Stein inherits her =20=

mentor William James=92s belief in the benefits of habit, and she values =
=20
especially the pleasure of repetition. This value stands apart from a =20=

dominating ethos against habit, best articulated by one of literary =20
modernism=92s key precursors, Walter Pater. Stein=92s emphasis on habit =20=

throughout her ouevre=97both stylistic and ideological=97becomes central =
=20
to what she wrote while living in German-occupied France. Habits both =20=

mask the disruption that war creates, dissolving the consequences of =20
the world into the space of the home, and paradoxically work as a way =20=

in which war itself can be best represented. Stein=92s World War II =20
writings foreground habit=92s crucial utility, but ultimately they also =20=

call attention to habit=92s political inadequacy. This lecture draws =20
from her forthcoming book, Modernism and the Ordinary (Oxford 2009).
History and Forms of Lyric Series, Sponsored by the Program in Poetry =20=

and Poetics


Thursday, November 20, 4:30 PM
August Kleinzahler
Rosenwald 405
1101 E. 58th St.
Chicago, IL 60637

Reception to follow.

August Kleinzahler published his first book of poetry, A Calendar of =20
Airs, in 1978. Since then, he has published seven others, including =20
Storm over Hackensack (1985); Earthquake Weather (1989); Red Sauce =20
Whiskey and Snow (FSG, 1995); Green Sees Things in Waves (FSG, 1998); =20=

and Live from the Hong Kong Nile Club: Poems 1975=961990 (FSG, 2000). In =
=20
2003, Farrar, Straus and Giroux published The Strange Hours Travelers =20=

Keep, which won the 2004 Griffin International Poetry Prize and the =20
2004 Gold Medal in Poetry from the Commonwealth Club of California, =20
and was short-listed for the U.K.=92s Forward Prize in Poetry. His most =20=

recent collection of poetry is Sleeping It Off in Rapid City (FSG, =20
2008). He is also the author of a book of prose, Cutty, One Rock: Low =20=

Characters and Strange Places, Gently Explained (FSG, 2004).

Poetry & Jazz: An Experiment.
Harper 148
1116 E. 59th St.
Chicago, IL 60637

Reception to follow.

August Kleinzahler will be discussing the experiments of reading =20
poetry to jazz accompaniment in the 1950s and early '60s--Rexroth, =20
Ferlinghetti, Kerouac, Patchen, Logue, et al--and the intellectual/=20
cultural background and impulse behind these experiments, chief of =20
among these: jazz emerging as a folk-based "art music," as opposed to =20=

dance music or popular entertainment; and the notion of the "negro" as =20=

ennobled outsider, existential hero. He'll also discuss instances of =20
black jazz artists, like Mingus and George Russell, going the reverse =20=

direction and mixing poetry into the their musical compositions.
Sponsored by the Poem Present Reading and Lecture Series.

Barry, I don't think anyone participating in this discussion has any intere=
st in any way in turning you into a scape goat.=A0 In my view, and in terms=
 of my input, the focus is on the negative ramifications of the term "Niger=
ian scam."=A0 I have found it interesting (at least), and provocative when =
some have risen to defend the use of the term.=20

This culture (American) if not elsewhere is obviously constantly wrestling =
with how to make descriptions accurate as opposed to defamatory. Sometimes =
I find the replacing terms=A0 ridiculous, or charmless, as say,'vertically =
disenfranchised' for short people previously perjoratively described as som=
ebody else.=20

Mark is quite right=A0 to suggest the 'politically correct' is not necessar=
ily 'accurate' either. I find it off-putting, to dismiss the discussion as =
"silly". If I were Chinese, for example, I think I would be uncomfortable w=
ith the term 'Asian Flu' as an annual moniker.=A0 But I will leave Mark's v=
iew for others to judge.=20

To personalize too much is probably the most prevalent disease among poets!=

The more I look at Harper and his cabinet
[Harper Harper Harper Harper, etc]
the more I am coming to agree with you.

But I do remember the good old days,
when Diefenbaker was to the left of Kennedy.

SPECIAL INTERMISSION GUEST

=A0

While Addenda is just beginning, there's a history. Dan
Sofaer and Christopher Anderson first met when Christopher was the singer i=
n
the Washington, D.C. band Nine Men Are Suicides. After being
musical director for the recording of the one song the band knew how to pla=
y
(Sister Ray by the Velvet Underground), Dan went on to be a founding member=
 of
the Silence After and Christopher rejoined him in '88 for the short-lived
Hurricane Daisy, whose killer demo had Fugazi's Don Zientara for its produc=
er.
After years in the wilderness, Dan reemerged as bassist in the San Francisc=
o trio Giant Haystacks, and
Christopher posted some Prince covers on MySpace. A chance note from Japan =
has
reunited them, and they're ready to bring the spirit to the letter.

What did your mother throw away?

What did she make you throw away?







When playwright Tom Cone was a kid he had a box full of baseballs =20
autographed by all the players on both teams in the 1956 World =20
Series. His dad told him they would pay for his retirement one day.

His mother gave them to some kids to play ball with.

When I was a kid my mother heard about some bozo psychologist who =20
said that comic books would turn your kids into criminals, so she =20
made me get rid of my World=92s Finest Comics #1 etc. and my run of =20
Batman and Detective Comics (collectors will know where I was coming =20
from).

Later she chucked out my complete 1951 Bremerton Blue Jackets =20
baseball uniform.

When Jean Baird the human whirlwind heard these stories she said =20
there had to be an anthology there somewhere.

So what do you think? Do you have a story such as this that you have =20
always wanted to tell, or have been telling for years?

E-mail me at the above address, or e-mail Jean Baird at

Jim,

"It's certainly a different type of reading. One of course is not
obliged or asked to read thousands of texts but to get some sense of the
range and nature of the generative capacity of the process."

Exactly. then one is experiencing the poem as a/in terms of a concept.

Jim, when you look at oulipo in both its conceptual and procedural aspects,
procedural limits leading to endless works within those limits, are you not
saying these two aspects are related?

Ciao,

Murat

German measles, anyone?

Many of the strange usages we've been talking=20
about occur in clusters, because of long-term=20
enmity between peoples, as in all the phrases=20
beginning with "french." Add "french bed" to my=20
list. The one-offs, like Nigerian scam or Asian=20
flu or Spanish influenza, are one-offs precisely=20
because they don't indicate or participate in a=20
larger derogation, even if that derogation exists=20
in other spheres--i.e., we certainly have plenty=20
of racism, but Nigerian scam isn't part of it,=20
and I doubt it provokes a racist image. It=20
certainly doesn't imply--I don't think in its=20
decade of usage has ever implied--a more general=20
view of Nigerians as schemers.

It's a matter of circumstance and degree. It's a=20
good thing that we tend to filter out the openly=20
racist--I could do without phrases like "I jewed=20
him down," though "jews harp" doesn't bother me--doesn't carry a threat.

How about the common (in the Caribbean) "Cubans=20
are the Jews of the Caribbean," meaning both=20
well-educated and given to argument. Or, as Lydia=20
Cabrera reports in El Monte (which, if you have=20
Spanish, run out to your nearest botanica and=20
buy), Jews and Chinese are the most dangerous mayomberos?

These usages also tend to proliferate in=20
environments in which diverse peoples live=20
together in relative raucous comfort (like New=20
York or Havana). Italian haircut (ouch! ouch!)? Polish jokes? Moldavian=
 crud?

What did I forget? Don't be embarrassed to chime in.

I would be interested to know from those with=20
more experience in other countries than I have,=20
what common phrases include American, yankee, etc. I'm sure they exist.

The question remains, given that all language=20
contains enormous stores of history, and that=20
some of that history is truly toxic, to what=20
degree are well-meaning people supposed to filter=20
before they speak? At what pont have we overly=20
limited communication? Or reduced ourselves to=20
stammering? Me, I'd be as conservative as=20
possible about self-censorship, and clearly we=20
each draw the line where it seems appropriate.

In this case I'll stick with "silly." Some might=20
be offended if I called it "Californian." It is=20
interesting to know where others draw the line,=20
but less so when it smacks of prescription.

Subject:      PennSound Launches a New Louis Zukofsky Page
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Today, we're extremely proud to announce PennSound's newest addition: an
extensive author page for the highly-influential American Objectivist, Louis
Zukofsky (http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Zukofsky.html). Nearly six
months in the making, this page brings together nearly twenty full-length
recordings by the poet, including important readings, conversations and
lectures, along with supplementary materials responding to Zukofsky's work.

The earliest of the seventeen readings contained in our Zukofsky archives is
a 1954 appearance on Berkeley's KPFA Radio, which includes a number of
excerpts from 1946's *Anew*, as well as *"A"*-11 and the second half of *"A"
*-9. Selections from *Anew* and 1941's *55 Poems* comprise much of the
setlist from his 1958 reading at the Poetry Center at the San Francisco
State University, as well as a historic 80-minute homemade tape for the
Library of Congress, recorded in November 1960, which also features lengthy
samplings from *Some Time*, *Songs of Degrees*, *Catullus* and *Barely and
Widely*. Another homemade tape from the following year includes
*Catullus*1-46 (save 18 & 19).

Other historic recordings include a 1961 reading at Les Deux Megots
(precursor to the St. Mark's Poetry Project), recorded by reading organizer
Paul Blackburn and broadcast on WBAI-FM; a two-hour 1962 session at New York
City's A&R Recording Company, which includes a broad survey of his work from
*"A,"* *After I's*, *Catullus*, *Some Time*, *Barely and Widely*, *Anew* and
*55 Poems*; a 1971 recording of *Autobiography* taken from Lincoln Center;
1972 readings at Temple University, Glassboro State College and Bard
College; and a 1975 recording by Hugh Kenner of a reading at Johns Hopkins
University featuring selections from *"A"* and *80 Flowers*, plus "A Foin
Lass Bodders," Zukofsky's Brooklynese rendering of Cavalcanti's "Donna Me
Prega."

In addition to these recordings, you'll also find a 1961 conversation
between Zukofsky and Robert Creeley, a 1971 lecture on Wallace Stevens at
the University of Connecticut and a handful of broadcast appearances. These
resources are augmented by a number of recordings of contemporary poets
performing and interpreting Zukofsky's work, including Charles Bernstein's
take on "A Foin Lass Bodders," Guy Davenport's comparisons of Zukofsky's *
Catullus* poems and the original Latin texts, and a pair of marvelous
performances of *"A"-24*, recorded in the Bay Area in 1978, which feature
Steve Benson, Carla Harryman, Lyn Hejinian, Kit Robinson and Bob Perelman
(on piano). There are also links to videos from 2004's Zukofsky Centennial
Conference at Columbia University & Barnard College, featuring Perelman,
Creeley, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Norman Finkelstein and Mark Scroggins, among
others. Those interested in further Objectivist listening will also want to
check out PennSound's author pages for Charles Reznikoff and Carl Rakosi.

PennSound is immeasurably grateful to Paul Zukofsky for his gracious
permission to share these many recordings of his father's work with a
worldwide audience. Archives such as this do not materialize overnight, and
so we'd like to thank Danny Snelson, our Zukofsky page editor for his
tireless efforts. Peter Quartermain, Mark Scroggins and Ron Silliman also
deserve thanks for both editorial input and access to recordings from their
collections. Richard Sieburth and Jeff Twitchell-Waas also provided helpful
feedback on the collection, and Mollie Braverman, Kareem Estefan and Jenny
Lesser spent countless hours digitizing and editing recordings. It's our
sincere hope that this Zukofsky page will be an indispensable resource for
fans and scholars of the poet, and an avenue for those not familiar with his
work to begin their acquaintance. Follow this link to start listening:

=0A=0A Interesting argument. You are simply telling us that language does n=

Possibly lost amidst the generous and honorable hullabaloo regarding the
recent poetics scam was the very real possibility that a well-regarded
friend and comrade might have been in grave danger and needed very real
and immediate help.

Meanwhile, there developed deep and evolutionary discussion about the
correctness of the language used to alert folks to his predicament.

What if the predicament had been real, dire, no nonsense? =20

Man, would we all have looked pretty damn stupid or brilliantly
sensitive?

I think it's astounding what lengths we post-avant, Modern poets will go
to protect the state of the art and the purity of our letters even if we
must risk the actual life or lives of our comrades in Accomplishment.
How far we've come from the rest of the animals on the planet, the lower
species that lack the technologies of language and must rely solely on
instinct and their bodies to survive.

Dear Friends of Small Press Traffic,

If there is anyone out there who still doubts that
Small Press Traffic is a place where all things are
possible, who still wonders if the dream of our
founders is alive in our time, who still questions
the power of the literary community, membership
is your answer.

Please join or renew your SPT membership today at:
http://www.sptraffic.org/html/supporters.htm
<http://www.sptraffic.org/html/supporters.htm%20>
Memberships are available at the following rates:
Students $30.00; Single Membership $40; Friend
of SPT $100; Benefactor $500; and Patron $1,000.

In this election year marked both by fraught economic
times and a fierce spirit of hope, Small Press Traffic
is asking once again for your support.  In the face of
adversity, poets have always banned together and
redistributed their great wealth to keep innovation and
experimentation alive. YES WE CAN! It may seem
difficult to renew 50 members by the end of 2008, but
with your help, it can be done. YES WE CAN! The
road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep.
We may not get there in one week or even in one month.
But, Friends of SPT, we have never been more hopeful
than we are just now that we will get there.

There are many changes you can count on in the year
ahead for Small Press Traffic: SPT has just elected a new
leader of its own to guide the organization in innovative directions
while continuing to bring together culturally diverse independent
readers, writers, and presses. We have an incredible
line-up scheduled for the Spring 2009 season. And we
have moved into our own new digs on the CCA San Francisco
Campus, crossing the aisle of the campus to continue to provide
the quality programming you rely on all year long.

As a member of Small Press Traffic, you will receive free
admission to all of our events, your name will appear on our
website and in our nationally circulated fliers, and you will have
the satisfaction of knowing that you are doing your part to
support innovative literature in the Bay Area and beyond.
Please become a member or renew your membership today.
The first 50 people to join or renew will receive archival
broadsides from our vintage collection. And it's so easy.
Just visit http://www.sptraffic.org/html/supporters.htm and
choose the amount you'd like to donate.  Please remember
that these funds are tax-deductible and provide much needed
funds for SPT's new upcoming events, travel funds for writers,
ground-breaking symposia, and new equipment.

This is our time, to put our poets back to work and open doors
of opportunity for our experimental writers and thinkers; to restore
prosperity and promote the cause of experimental literature; to
reclaim the dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that, out
of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope. And where
we are met with cynicism and doubts and those who tell us that
we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up
the spirit of a literary community: Yes, we can!

Thank you and see you Fridays,

The Small Press Traffic Board of Directors

Treasurer, Brent Cunningham; Secretary, Scott Inguito; Board

I have to go with you here. However, I think the digression was worth it; at
least, once in a while we can test how far we can go in tolerating the views
and reactions of other people. It is part of what is called "life skills".
It is part of the POETICS of interaction. You know, artists are sometimes so
excited with themselves and their ideas that they can't tell when they have
erred, or do not care if they have erred. Sometimes we think that, as
artists, we cannot say we are sorry (even if we don't mean it), because that
would strip us of our beatification as the best group in the world. All our
works are about human behaviour, we must not forget.
Let my habitation in language not become my prison, my blindfold, my hell.

Thanks for the observation.

c'mon."

Elaine Equi is the author of more than ten poetry collections, and her
latest book, *Ripple Effect: New & Selected Poems*, was a finalist for the
L.A. Times Book Award and on the short list for The Griffin Poetry Prize. H=
er
collection *Voice-Over* won the San Francisco State Poetry Award.  Her work
is widely anthologized and appears in *Postmodern American Poetry: a Norton
Anthology* and in several editions of *The Best American Poetry*.  A native
of Chicago, Equi lives in New York City, and teaches at New York University
and in the MFA programs at The New School and City College. -robin brox


Jerome Sala has been described as an "honorable hysteric" by critic Peter
Schjeldahl.   His latest book is *Look Slimmer Instantly* from Soft Skull
Press, and its website explains Sala "was, in fact, one of the first 'World
Heavyweight Champions' of poetry [by taking part in performances held in
actual boxing rings, predating today's poetry slams]. Additionally, along
with poet Elaine Equi, he was connected with a punk poetry scene originatin=
g
out of L.A., and gathered in Dennis Cooper's anthology of the early
80s: *Coming
Attractions*. From these roots, Sala's work continued to develop =96 explor=
ing
the connections between the pop and the poetic, the high and the low, the
ironic and the political =96 all the while maintaining a healthy dadaistic
suspicion of all things literary."  -robin brox

SPECIAL INTERMISSION GUEST

While Addenda is just beginning, there's a history. Dan Sofaer and
Christopher Anderson first met when Christopher was the singer in the
Washington, D.C. band Nine Men Are Suicides. After being musical
director for the recording of the one song the band knew how to play
(Sister Ray by the Velvet Underground), Dan went on to be a founding
member of the Silence After and Christopher rejoined him in '88 for
the short-lived Hurricane Daisy, whose killer demo had Fugazi's Don
Zientara for its producer. After years in the wilderness, Dan
reemerged as bassist in the San Francisco trio Giant Haystacks, and
Christopher posted some Prince covers on MySpace. A chance note from
Japan has reunited them, and they're ready to bring the spirit to the
letter.

GINSBERG'S KARMA. A documentary about the legendary
poet Allen Ginsberg and his mythical journey to India
in the early 1960s that transformed his perspective on
life and his work. Poet Bob Holman traces the two
years Ginsberg spent in India by visiting the places
where he stayed and talk with the people he met and
influenced, as well as, intimate interviews with Beat
poets and friends.
http://www.rattapallax.com/ginsberg.htm

ON THE GRIOT TRAIL: Bob Holman and Papa Susso in West
Africa. The film is about Alhaji Papa Susso, a Gambian
folk poet and Bob Holman, a contemporary US poet, who
are long-time friends. They travel to Africa to
discover the oral traditions of language and
storytelling that are quickly disappearing. Through
their travels in Gambia, Senegal, Mali and Guinea,
they also explore African music and its influence on
contemporary American jazz, rock n' roll, and blues
and how traditional African music is being displaced
by urban hip-hop, whose roots are in Africa.
Throughout West Africa, they meet many different
Griots, or storytellers, whose vast memories include
the history of their tribes and re-tell it through
songs and epic poems. Currently Filming in Africa.
http://www.rattapallax.com/griot.htm

O SONHO BOLLYWOODIANO. Rattapallax Films announces the
first Indian-Brazilian co-production. "O Sonho
Bollywoodiano" is directed by Beatriz Seigne-Martin
and stars Paula Braun, Lorena Lobato and Nataly
Galleazzo Cabanas. The production just finished
shooting all over India. Legendary Indian filmmaker
Santosh Sivan (The Terrorist) is Executive Producer.
The film is a comedy about three beautiful Brazilian
actresses who decide to try their luck breaking into
the Bollywood. When they arrive in India, their dreams
change dramatically through a series of mishaps and
unexpected occurrences. This heart-felt comedy reveals
the wonderful cultural difference between both
countries while three young actresses search for their
dream in a country thousands of miles away. While
filming a song and dance sequence in Mumbai, TV
Globo's show Fantastico interviewed the actresses and
director. The film will be released next year.
http://www.rattapallax.com/bollywoodiano.htm

BOLLYWORLD. India is going through extraordinary
changes and entering the global market. This
documentary focuses on how India's largest film
industry "Bollywood" is transforming itself to appeal
to a world audience and an emerging Indian middle
class. The documentary follows two brothers, Sanjay
and Kumar, as they try to make their big movie. We get
a glimpse into the many dimensions of Bollywood and
the people who make a living entertaining over 3
billion people a year.
http://www.rattapallax.com/bollyworld.htm

ALIEN ROADKILL. A documentary about African-American
poet Lamont B. Steptoe and his search for the aliens
who abducted him in Philadelphia. Steptoe is an
American Book Award winner and suffering from
post-traumatic syndrome resulting from the Vietnam
War. In 2008, he taveled to Roswell, New Mexico to the
Roswell UFO Festival to find the aliens he encountered
and seek spiritual solace at the famed crash site.
While at Roswell, he meets other people who were also
aducted by aliens and soon discovers that he is not
"alone." http://www.rattapallax.com/steptoe2.htm

FABULOUS HAIR! This exuberant documentary follows
several Philadelphia-based African-American

Steve,

I agree with you there. If what goes on on this list were more visible
(unfortunately, also more relevant to the wider world!}, we would have been
subject to a SNL skit.

This discussion about "language" is like describing the color of fire when a
house is burning.

Here my conscience is clear. I was ready to send "david" three hundred
dollars when I leart the whole thing was a scam.

Barry, once again, don't take this to heart and think occasional good things
which happen here.

No one seems to have responded to my query how many among who were insulted
by "Nigerian scam" were Nigerians or even Africans. I assume by this that
nobody. all this was a verbal exercise. May be we can apply a bit of reality
principle here.

Ciao,

Murat

Certainly ithere's a fine line between changing language and have a
committee dictate which language is ok for "consumption."

I think filtering out words isn't a waste of time. It's pretty constabulary=
,
though.

Dear Obododimma,

I did not say that, nor did Mark as far as I know. And I think I can speak
up for him.
Something that makes me chuckle is the English saying: "Excuse my French!"
The English, the obstinate enemies of the French, all along history, and
vice versa: "Merde aux Anglais!"
Not to talk of the Germans against the French, the French against the
Italians, the Italians against them all, the Norther Italians against the
southern Italians, and the infinite sayings that appear once in a while in =
a
colloquial form. I / we do respect Derrida and his precious work. What I
wish to say is that we cannot cancel history in just a second with good
will.
I do appreciate your remark, though.

This is cheap humor, and anyhow that is what our daily life is made of.
Isn't your neighbor your worst enemy? It is the law of instinct, then with
reason, as the goodwill of the list has shown up to the point that Barry
Schwabsky very probably signed off (and once again I am sorry), with reason
you sort things out and start being more careful. I never again used the
saying I quoted in my previous mail. It was a lesson for me. I just wanted
to show Barry and the list that sometimes you simply do not think, and as I
said, you unwillingly trigger a chain of unsolved ethnic conflicts.

I hope I was clear. I also thank you for giving me the opportunity to
clarify what I said before.

It's always interesting to be the butt of sarcasm, but accuracy also
counts. I was I thought pointing out the large gray areas, and
talking about appropriateness (albeit with tongue wandering into
cheek at times). I doubt that I've caused too many wars today.

But your examples present some interesting issues. Policeman became
obsolete as a generic term when women were allowed to join police
forces, and other terms that cover both genders, like cops, police,
or police officers, took over, because it would have been absurd to
do otherwise. But we refer to policemen and policewomen when
appropriate--it's not anachronistic to point out a policewoman to
someone who needs help, if that's who's available. The word
stewardess, which is the term I think you were searching for, became
an issue because it had an extraprofessional use as fetish. That
survives to an extent, but probably more than the word itself, which
dates back to when cabin crews were exclusively female (and
exclusively young--there were age discrimination suits about that).
Poetess had largely fallen out of fashion by the time modern feminism
arrived, relegated to designating only some women poets. And it's a
good thing that it died--the attitude expressed by the word had
become poisonous.

These are all questions of gender, in a language that has become less
and less gendered over the past thousand years. It's not something
that speakers of more gendered languages worry about too much,
because to do something about it would require the restructuring of
grammar. Airplane crews are still hotes and hotesses, actors are
comedians and comediennes, etc, and the French sun is masculine and
the moon feminine, while in German it's the reverse. So the battles
are fought elsewhere. In modern English there were so few distinct
masculine and feminine forms for human occupations that most of the
work of remaking the language would involve the renaming of the
beasts--stallion and mare, buck and doe, etc. Don't mistake me--I'm
plenty aware of gender issues. I'm talking about the genders of
articles, nouns, pronouns and adjectives.

A travel article in today's New York Times web edition, "The Proud
Indians of Chiapas," has attracted a lot of comments, mostly about
the use of the word Indian. Many of the respondents pointed out that
in Chiapas, and Latin America in general, the (recently) preferred
term is "indigena" (which is both masculine and feminine, by the
way). The objection noted to Indian is that it's inaccurate. In
Spanish it's worse than that--Indio is often a derogatory term, and
India in some places is a synonym for whore. But the article is
written for gringos. In the US there's no unanimity among  (let's
call them) first peoples about what to call themselves. Native
American doesn't seem to have caught on, though it appeared to for a
while, and members of a lot of tribes prefer to be called American
Indians and don't mind that their reservations are generically called
Indian reservations. In the country at large Indian is nowhere near
as derogatory as Indio or India. It apparently didn't raise eyebrows
among the Times staffers.

It's not up to me, it's up to the people so designated, who have a
long history of persecution by whatever name. Not so the compound
noun Nigerian scam. It's hard for me to believe that anyone uses it
with derogation of Nigerians in general in mind, and I don't think
there's a shred of antiNigerian sentiment in the US, where most
people would be hard put to say what a Nigerian is.

But ok, what about the name Nigeria--Blackland? Is that an acceptable
inheritance from the colonialist past?

If this thread continues, it would be nice if it involved discussion
rather than verbal violence. The issues are interesting in themselves.

Mark

The Accidental Tourist,


Essays on the phenomenology of virtual worlds, with special attention paid to
Second Life

- Alan Sondheim

Book available from FORT!/DA?

http://www.pd.org/~zeug/fort-da/fort-da.html

THE ACCIDENTAL ARTIST was an ongoing exhibition in Second Life at Odyssey, June
2008 - January 2009, by Alan Sondheim, with help from Sugar Seville, Azure
Carter, Gary Nanes, Sandy Baldwin, and Frances van Scoy at the Virtual
Environments Laboratory, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia.
The show changed daily and the gave me an opportunity to study the
phenomenology of a virtual world in relation to avatar-human objectivity.

"I think of this as a form of information implosion where everything gets out
of hand, or a war or sex zone where it's impossible to walk or think, or
Pliny's uncle's death (and other devastation) when Vesuvius blew: What does one
do in such a situation? How does one do it? One false step or click and you're
underwater or in the skysphere ..."

from back cover, Alan Sondheim

The book contains all of the critical writings I've done on Second Life,
modified into a single sectioned text.

Thanks so much for possibly ordering! (If not, thanks for reading this far!)

Hi all--I'm forwarding this from Tim Hunt (tahunt@ilstu.edu) . . .

The Beat Studies Association invites proposals for papers on all
aspects of Beat literature and Beat studies for the two panels the
association anticipates sponsoring at this year's American Literature
Association Conference (May 21-24 in Boston).  Proposals of one to two
pages (250-500 words) should be sent electronically to Tim Hunt at
tahunt@ilstu.edu by January 2, 2009.

The Beat Studies Association would especially welcome proposals that
engage understudied figures central to or related to the Beats and
proposals that consider the significance of current and emerging
critical paradigms for study of the Beats.

> then one is experiencing the poem as a/in terms of a concept.

That is often a strong dimension of conceptual work, isn't it. Chairness of
the chair. Bearness of the bear. Though it needn't be the only dimension.
And usually isn't. The work can be more sensual or sensorial or typically
literary or artistic in some ways or whatever, as well; the conceptual is a
dimension, not a be all and end all. Though I suppose it's easy to miss the
conceptual dimension so some artists like to focus attention on it by the
absence of other dimensions. In a sense, this is a pop approach.

Also, as elsewhere in art, pretenders can be quick to exploit opportunities.
Conceptual art can sometimes be a term applied to work lacking in all craft
and art as though it was punk with brains. Ya OK, I guess, if the brains
seems to be there and it's somehow challenging or the concept is interesting
or something. Something. It's just easier to pretend to the conceptual than
it is to some other types of work where the chops are not so easily fakable.
On the other hand, there's nothing like strong conceptual work to change the
way we see things in a jolt.

In Oulipo, it seems clear that the conceptual and procedural are strongly
related, yes. But in conceptual poetry more generally, they needn't be.

ja

Here's a slidvid show of what I've done with dbCinema so far:
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kandinsky/slidvid.htm

This plays around 20 minutes or so, depending on the speed of your
connection and network traffic yadayada. If yer using a PC, press the F11
key to toggle yer browser fullscreen. The bigger yer monitor is, the better
this looks.

This cycles through all the graphic series I've created with dbCinema so
far.

There are some slidvid controls up at the top left of the screen. If you
mouseover the controls, some text appears that shows you what the control
does.

The title of each series appears among those controls. The title indicates
the sort of images dbCinema used in creating the graphics. For instance, the
"Graphic Loven" series is made of pictures downloaded by dbCinema from the
Internet via a search for the term "graphic novel". The "Silvia Saint"
series is made of pictures downloaded by dbCinema from the Internet via a
search for the term "Silvia Saint".

dbCinema is a graphic synthesizer I'm writing in Adobe Director.

There's info about dbCinema at http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kandinsky3/intro .
Actually this is info about the kandinsky3 series, but much of it is about
dbCinema more generally.

There are also video tutorials I've created at
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/video/1.htm ,
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/video/2.htm , and
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/video/3 . These are kind of dull though. They're
just software tutorials. And they're old.

There's a little review of dbCinema from Paris (in French) at
http://www.fluctuat.net/blog/10347-Notre-Dame-destructuree .

I cannot say enough about China, mostly because I have lived here the past =

Weeds star Mary Louise-Parker is gearing up for a new project. Earlier this
month, it was announced that she will be part of a new biopic, which will b=
e
written, directed and produced by Oscar-winning documentarians Rob Epstein
and Jeffrey Friedman.

The beatnik biopic entitled Howl is based on Allen Ginsberg=B9s epic
book-length poem of the same title.  The film will commemorate the 50th
anniversary of the poem, and will feature animated visualizations of the
piece, courtesy of graphic novelist Eric Drooker.

Cast members include David Strathairn (Good Night and Good Luck), who will
play prosecuting attorney Ralph McIntosh, Alan Alda (The West Wing), who
will play Judge Clayton Horn, Jeff Daniels (Traitor), who will play
Professor David Kirk, Paul Rudd, who will play Luthor Nichols and Weeds sta=
r
Mary-Louise Parker who will play prosecution witness Gail Potter.  James
Franco, who appeared in the Spider-Man films, will be playing Allen
Ginsberg.

"Fifty years later, Ginsberg's vision is as relevant as the year he wrote
it," Friedman told the Hollywood Reporter.  "It resonates with issues of
free speech, government censorship, militaristic empire building,
fear-mongering, sexual conformity and the co-opting of religion."

Carter Burwell will be writing the original score while Epstein and
Friedman, who previously worked together on the Oscar-winning Common
Threads: Stories from the Quilt, will be co-directing the film.  Epstein's
other film credits include the Oscar-winning The Times of Harvey Milk. [Gus
Van Sant will be producing.]

_______________


I write in praise of the poet Johan Meskens.  Based at Ghent in
Belgium, Meskens is a motion/action poet, visual poet, & net-artist.

I have followed the aleatoric & serialist work of Meskens since 2002,
with great interest & appreciation.  Much of his work is profoundly
original & dynamic, in conception & in execution.  Indeed, he is drawn
to poetry with a dialectical philosophy of music & noise, cities &
landscapes, & silence.

Johan Meskens admires the works of Mozart, Beethoven, Adolphe Sax, Jim
Morrison, & Albert Einstein.  But in his own poetic work, he struggles
with contending elements:  John Cage or Frank Zappa, Dimitri
Shostakovich or Ennio Morricone, Theloneus Monk or Charlie Parker,
Pink Floyd or The Doors.

To examine the aleatoric & poetic "music," & the "musical" serialism,
of Johan Meskens, go to

Hey, What=B9s All The Hooplah?

Forget the impending breadlines, grab your polka-dotted canvas bindle,
bundle up and bustle your way over to hear the tales of times said and gone
and the prophetic parables of a new generation of poets, storytellers and
musicians. Featuring music and performances by John Houx, Elizabeth Devlin,
Frank Hoier, & others T.B.A. Mr. Houx grew up in West coast cattle country
and "hoboed" his way to New York in 2007, where he was quickly embraced by
the East Village's Antifolk scene and traditional folk music circles. With
appearances on radio and television (broadcast and online), John is
presently planning his first full-length record and a small European tour.
Elizabeth Devlin has traveled the world to invoke influences from scratchy
American and French phonographs, combining bitter-sweet, haunting vocals
with angelic, cacophonous Autoharp melodies. Her forthcoming full-length
album will be released on December 6th, 2008. Frank Hoier is poised at the
front of a new wave of modern Americana roots music. Backed by rock'n'roll
prodigy siblings, The Weber Brothers, Frank's self released album Lovers &
Dollars is set for it's national debut on November 11, 2008. Frank Hoier
brings a fresh perspective and a rock'n'roll energy to Folk music. His
Guthrie-esque anthem "Jesus Don't Give Tax Breaks To The Rich" has been
hailed as "the most perfect protest song written yet this millennium"
(PopHeadWound).

Mark said:

> rather than verbal violence. The issues are interesting in themselves.

Indeed, and I don't think this point has been brought up quite explicitly in
the history of the term, but we're not looking at just *any {goldbrick
***}scam (like the poor, they will be with us always), but at a particular
variety -- the Spanish Prisoner Scam.

This shifted locale and terminology not through any resurgence of
colonialism, but because that particular variety of con game suddenly became
part of the Internet.

What baffled me from the start was the mechanism of it -- the appeal to
unreflecting greed of the rich West being given the opportunity to benefit
from the suffering of the less fortunate parts of the world.  [Insert scare
quotes as appropriate.]

At one stage, before virtually any spam filter could catch it, there was an
ambulance-chasing aspect to the business -- the minute a civil war exploded
anywhere, suddenly we were solicited by a member of the beaurocracy of the
suffering country to make millions by accepting dirty money.

Oh, boy, and leave aside the naivity or greed of anyone who fell for this
...

Then there was grammatical nature of the texts -- they seem to have been
crafted by someone who had a fairly clear idea of what would be expected to
be grammatical prejudices of a Western addressee as to the mistakes likely
to be made by a second-language African speaker.

Ouch!!!

But in some ways, this is yesterday's smasgrabord.  At the moment, in the UK
at least, what's getting past at least my spam filters are specifically
crafted appeals to reveal your details as to membership of *very locally
English building societies -- Alliance&Leicester, Lloyds, Abbey National --
and as a Scot, I'm tempted to say this illustrates the peculiar blind dumb
ignorance of the English, with whom we are forced to share the British
Isles.

But perhaps there's a USAmerican variety of this that I'm not aware of.
(Mind you, no one has yet appealed to me to buy shares in RBS at firesale
prices.)

And just to put myself on the right side of the geographical and
prejudicicial divide of this, only the English could construct a Scotch pie
out of a silly sheep ...

Robin

[There's a peculiar incident, both funny and unlikely, in one of the Edgar
Wallace Sanders-of-the-River collections, I think _Bones In London_, in
which Mister Commisioner Sanders, accosted by someone who wants to sell him
a cheap gold brick, promply drags the con artist to the nearest police
station on the assumption that the man is trying to sell him something that
had been illicitly mined in the colonial territories.

Used to be IDB, now it's called something different, I think, but plus ca
change, Haliburton ...  Boy, they don't make colonial administrators like
they used to in the glory days of the Raj.  <g>

R.  ]

Jim,

Though our points of view are converging, I should also try to clarify the
opposite point I am making: when concepual, particularly of the procedural
kind, explodes into unmanagable profileration when it becomes actualized. In
that way, the concept gets deluted, blurred, weakened.

"though I suppose it's easy to miss the conceptual dimension so some artists
like to focus attention on it by the absence of other dimensions. In a
sense, this is a pop approach."

Well, pop can be a powerful art form.

"Something. It's just easier to pretend to the conceptual than it is to some
other types of work where the chops are not so easily fakable."

In my recent conversation with Chris Funhouser, he was telling me how hard
it was to create some of his "flash"? pieces. They are gorgeous, evocative
to watch. on the other hand, it is a blessing that they are hard to
actualize. They are a limited number of them.

Ciao,

Murat

Dear Anny,I think the point you made was quite clear: sometimes we may use
words that others object to, and, to show that we don't mean any hurt, we
apologize. That's a normal practice of redress for perceived face threat in
politeness theory. I would (and many scholars working on politeness) even
prefer Avoidance Strategy. Well, not everyone would avoid performing
face-threatening acts in cross-cultural communications. And we have seen th=
e
consequences in history.
Regards.
Obododimma.

Well, I guess I have I have made my point in this thread and cannot compel
anyone to give that point a second thought. By writing about "some wars
starting from recklessness in the use of language", I was not necessarily
addressing your analysis, or your use of words. I was simply referring to
the orientation of
say-it-the-way-you-like-it-don't-care-about-what-anyone-feels. It's good
that Anny Ballardini gave an example of a personal experience he had when he
used the expression "working as hard as a negro". For him, he didn't mean
any prejudice. But someone there saw something else in the analogy and got
offended. And what did Ballardini do next?One has to decide for oneself how
to manage one's language and situations that unfold from language use in a
world where people indeed see language as social semiotic.
For me, this is where the thread ends.

Regards.
Obododimma.

the procedural doesn't necessarily involve the sort of proliferation you
mention, of course.

for instance, http://vispo.com/StirFryTexts/spastext.html  or
http://vispo.com/arteroids

the generative, on the other hand, is more often associated with
proliferation. not always, though. 'generative art' is a whole field.
dbCinema is generative.

you say "the concept gets deluted, blurred, weakened" via proliferation.
sometimes. but sometimes proliferation is part of the concept. the work of
art in the age of mechanical reproduction. proliferation. spamification.
that still doesn't tell us whether it's interesting or not. there just are
no recipes for interesting art. no algorithms that will do it every time.
some algorithms that will do it from time to time. but not all the time.
like there is no algorithm that will always be able to tell if any given
program will halt.

Re the other two phrases, from phrases.org.uk, which everyone should
bookmark, along with http://www.etymonline.com/. Here's the latter on "spade."

<http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=spade>spade
<http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=spade>(1)
"tool for digging," O.E. spadu, from P.Gmc. *spadon (cf. O.Fris.
spada, M.Du. spade, O.S. spado, M.L.G. spade, Ger. Spaten), from PIE
*spe- "long, flat piece of wood" (cf. Gk. spathe "wooden blade,
paddle," O.E. spon "chip of wood, splinter," O.N. spann "shingle,
chip"). To call a spade a spade "use blunt language" (1542)
translates a Gk. proverb (known to the Romans), but Erasmus mistook
Gk. skaphe "trough, bowl" for a derivative of the stem of skaptein
"to dig," and the mistake has stuck. The original, then, is "to call
a bowl a bowl."
<http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=spade>spade
<http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=spade>(2)
"figure on playing cards," 1598, probably from It. spade, pl. of
spada "sword, spade," from L. spatha "broad, flat weapon or tool,"
from Gk. spathe "broad blade" (see
<http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=spade>spade (1)). Phrase in
spades "in abundance" first recorded 1929 (Damon Runyon), probably
from bridge, where spades are the highest-ranking suit.
"The invitations to the musicale came sliding in by pairs and threes
and spade flushes." [O.Henry, "Cabbages & Kings," 1904]

Derogatory meaning "black person" is 1928, from the color of the
playing card symbol.

Not to retread abused tires, but my sense is that the re-use of "Nigerian s=
cam" re-enforces a unilateral sense that it is 'native ' condition of all N=
igerians to try and trick us out of our money. (Mark is quite right that on=
ly a small percentage of Americans have any other concept of Nigeria and/or=
 Nigerians. Why is maybe a question that be addressed - but I suspect its h=
as something to with this country's post-colonial practices (petroleum inte=
rests, etc) in Nigeria. (What you are not allowed to know will not bother y=
ou!)

What ruffles is the way "Nigerian scam" may be similar to the way people us=
ed to glibly talk about getting 'gyped' '=A0 -=A0 "Gyping" being the assume=
d 'native' characteristic" of people born as Gypsies, the outstanding trait=
 of whom is to show up and trick upstanding people ("us") out of our money.=
=A0=A0=A0 It must of been those terribly sensitive, politically correct, la=
nguage police that drove 'gyp ' out of common, civilized usage.=A0=A0 Come =
on 'kids', no amount of historicizing is going to put the lid back on the i=
ssue here. I do believe it was Obododimma - a Nigeria - who put up his irri=
tation with the 'scam' tag (??) .=A0=A0=A0=A0 But maybe in raising the ques=
tion he was just 'scamming' us and playing with our liberal sensitivities.

Maybe ask a local Nigerian in your community what they think of the 'scam' =
term.=A0=20

Dear Anny,I think the point you made was quite clear: sometimes we may use
words that others object to, and, to show that we don't mean any hurt, we
apologize. That's a normal practice of redress for perceived face threat in
politeness theory. I would (and many scholars working on politeness) even
prefer Avoidance Strategy. Well, not everyone would avoid performing
face-threatening acts in cross-cultural communications. And we have seen th=
e
consequences in history.

Obododimma.

*a sampling, in brief:

---
In a Season of Switchblades
for Saint Augustine

After an awkward phase,     our bodies
became a pleasure to look at;

we got the hint that things     were starting
to fill out.
                We joined the Wreckers and

received matching coats. We bred
a subtle trouble     through the school halls.

Even a little danger loved was death won.
There were the bloody-nosed     at the video arcade

and haircuts in the bowling alley bathroom.
On one wall     a portrait of Cabeza de Vaca,

another, all the animals he brought.
There were Swishers to smoke and

showers to get the stink off. The Cineplex
was brimming with unheard-of poetries...

Other participating small presses, on November 25th, include:
Farfalla Press (Gary parrish, with performances by Anne Waldman and I Feel

***Open 24 Hours
*
Open 24 Hours is dedicated to publishing limited edition books by poets
working in traditions rooted in experimentation and social engagement. The
Open 24 Hours design is influenced by the staple-bound mimeo revolution of
the American small press underground most visibly recognized in the books
published by many 2nd- and 3rd-generation New York School Poets. We have
simply adapted the method to digital technology.

Open 24 Hours has published books by Mariana Ruiz Firmat, Corina Copp, Betsy
Fagin, Joel Dailey, Chris Toll, Steve Carey, Arlo Quint, Erica Kaufman, and
Dustin Williamson. Forthcoming are books by David Kirschenbaum and Will
Yakulic.

Open 24 Hours is based in New York City, edited and designed by John Coletti
and Greg Fuchs. Jon Allen is our in-house illustrator. We took the name from
D.C. poet Buck Downs, who published a poetry zine by the same name. Downs
inherited Open 24 Hours from Baltimore poet Chris Toll, who started it in
1980.

of the same title) (Big Game Books).  Kaufman holds an MFA from the New
School and was the winner of the 2003 New School University Chapbook

Does anybody on the list know if there's a list on the web of the
locations of papers of various poets, or of personal archives in
general? Something on the order of: type in Ezra Pound and it yields
Beineke, Yale.

Thanks.

In Columbus, a guy named Okla said he was the co-editor of New American Press and he would be publishing a collection by one of our former associate editors, Sean Karns. Has that collection been printed?

Agreed. Whether or not the offense exists in an "objective" sphere, it
exists, and should be redressed. And while I take issue with how much of
what we say (or that language programs us to say) DOESN'T offend, I'm sure
there are more egregious examples than others...

Bury the hatchet. (Native American ref.)

Beat a dead horse. (PETA?)

Paint the town red (viking violence)

Which offends more?

A)
B)
or C)?

The audience depends, and decides.

Mark -
Here's a response from an academic librarian friend:

"ArchiveGrid

Google

WorldCat (many archives also have catalog records)"

She also suggests asking a reference librarian - most libraries will
list their archival collections.

Best,
Charlotte

David loves to do - and interestingly - street side rubbings.
I hope the processe did not get turned on him, like, did he. himself,=A0 ge=
t 'rubbed' out?

Anybody have a good essay ref on contemporary 'rubbings' - the origins and =
aesthetics thereof. i.e. Rauschenberg/Cage and car tires rolling over a wet=
 white canvas. Yves Klein pulling naked fresh painted bodies over canvas to=
 make paintings.=A0 Amy Balkin - the other evening at Nonsite/San Francisco=
 - showing photographs of her rubbings of Corporate Industrial Park Signage=
.=A0=A0 Making 'art' with non-art tools (car, body, manhole covers, etc.), =
or making 'art' out of non-art (corporate signage, or David's industrial re=
mnants). What's the diff??

Are their examples of contemporary rubbings of contemporary poems (not talk=
ing 'malevolent criticism' here!) Are there examples of rubbings of portion=
s of non-art texts (say, from Government Reports on Global Warming)?=A0 (Wo=
rks by Hans Hackke (sp?) come to mind).

What is an artist/poet/person performing when making an artifact by 'rubbin=
g' an artifact of the past back into the present?=A0=20

What is 'the rub' - even the origins of that particular phrase when encount=
ering a point of friction?

Was Tina Fey doing=A0 'rubbings' of Sarah Palin?

Jim,

You are right. Generative art proliferates more easily. But I like the idea
of "concept' in "conceptual." Doesn't "generative" imply more a formula, an
algorithm? You would know that better, but even an algorithm may have a not
openly spelled out idea, concept behind it.

Walter Benjamin's mechanical reproduction is problematic. When he was
applying that term to photography, photographs were extremely difficult to
take, took a lot of time and exposure and the transformation from reflected
light to image was fragile and full of 'mistakes." That's what makes those
photographs sp powerful. did you read my essay *The Peripheral space of
photography*?

Ciao,

Unfortunately I have to track down a lot of archives. Worldcat, which
I use all the time for books, is difficult to use for archival
material, despite its listing many. I tried, as an experiment, to
follow it to Blackburn material in Frank O'Hara's papers. After an
hour and a half it had steered me in a circle. Google is also of
limited use. ArchiveGrid looks good--I'll try it at Columbia, which I
assume subscribes.

Thanks for all the b/c and f/c responses.

Seems to me that art, to be art, is necessarily generative. If it doesn't stimulate others to create, it's of no real value to anyone other than the person who made it. Which means it really isn't art. All art is social.

I'm in the process of creating a Con Ed course for the University of

When some people call art 'generative', they mean it stimulates them to
write or whatever. I take it that's your usage, Troy.

But the term 'generative art' has another meaning. It refers to a type of
art where the work of art, itself, generates not a response in the audience
but the visible or audible (or whatever) manifestation of the viewed work of
art. So, typically, this sort of work of art is an executable, digital work,
an app, a program, though it needn't be. Could be an analog machine or
perhaps, on a more conceptual level, injunctions to do this or that. Though,
in that case, the piece itself is not really doing the 'generation' and it
probably wouldn't be of much interest to people interested in 'generative
art'.

Just to clarify the term.

On another note. A work could stimulate others to reflect. That needn't be
stimulating them to create.

Would that be 'generative' in your sense? Is that of value? If so, and it is
not generative, then not all art is generative in your sense.

ja

I would take reflection as "generative" in that way. It is producing something. I would argue that if it produced indifference, though, it's not really generative of anything.

Thanks for the clarification.

Troy

'algorithm' is the 'natural selection' of our time. by that i mean the two
terms have both been widely misunderstood. Widely.

'algorithm' is misunderstood because the theory of computation is more than
misunderstood--it's unknown and somewhat non-intuitive in its results. it
gives us some of the clearest statements we have about what computers can
and can't do, i.e., it gives us our clearest statements about what
algorithms can and cannot accomplish.

The focus of the birth of computing
itself was on what computers *cannot* do. Turing solved a famous math
problem posed by Hilbert called the Entscheidungsproblem, a problem to
decide whether it is theoretically possible to build a machine that will
prove all math theorems. After understanding Godel's work, Turing understood
that the answer to this question must be 'no'. But in order to prove it, he
had to devise a machine that could execute any conceivable, finite
algorithm, and then show that there are some true theorems this machine
cannot prove. Thus was born the 'Turing machine', Turing's abstraction, the
most powerful but simple machine known to humanity. It was devised mainly to
help prove the Entscheidungsproblem, not to 'invent computers'. Turing
invented the modern notion of what a computer is in order to prove there are
some things such machines cannot do. beautiful, eh?

However, while there are things such machines cannot do, there is no real
evidence that we can do them either. Fundamentally, a Turing machine is a
machine that can execute any conceivable, finite algorithm. There is no good
evidence that there exist thought processes of which we are capable and
computers are not.

So, Murat, while algorithms are 'formulas', of a sort, they can get quite
sophisticated with a few million lines of code. The power of the simple
algorithm and a machine that can make decisions has yet to be really widely
understood. At first glance, computers look like machines that are merely
mechanical, like any other machine, and pose no serious resemblance to the
processes of thought. But the fundamental operations of the computer are
like the atomic scale of thought.

From my boiled-down perspective, one person used a term that another list m=
ember found problematic.=A0 The latter said so.

Several list members reacted to the questioning of said term with rote stra=
ins of resistance -- i.e.=A0 the don't-censor-me mentality, my intentions w=
eren't racist, other questionable-&-possibly-racist terms exist & here's a =
list.=A0=20

Some list members acknowledged that the use of the term is problematic and =
noted the need to be sensitive about using such terms.=A0=20

The aforementioned list members found the sympathetic response to be ... wo=
rth ignoring.=A0=20
In a world where institutions were built on racism and where those same ins=
titutions continue to reflect & rely on that racism & its underlying sentim=
ents (whether you're a skinhead or not) we should be open to calls for sens=
itivity, even if we didn't mean to imply anything racist or were unaware of=
 how our language use might be problematic.=A0 Such calls for sensitivity s=
hould certainly not be dismissed just because they are about being human an=
d possibly even admitting our vulnerability --rather than such calls being =
seen as the usual targets to attack so that one might show off his intellec=
tual prowess.=A0=20

This kind of discussion has carried on before on the list, and in the ensui=
ng discussion, many have left due to the expression of further racist senti=
ment and the denial of granting that a) we might be ignorant of the implica=
tions of some terms and b) maybe we should be more sensitive when someone p=
oints out something we've said that could be offensive.=A0=20

Despite how often we forget it, history tells us something.=A0 I'm still tr=
ying to learn, and if admitting ignorance, even about the implications of m=
y actions helps, then I'll pull out the mirror.=A0 Take a peek at some of w=
hat Tim Yu and others have said about the last race discussion on Poetics:

An excerpt:

"As an Asian American, I often have the (dubious) privilege of being
able to "pass" in everday life, with my race unremarked upon on the
street or in my workplace. There are moments, however, when this is not
possible--when I become aware (often uncomfortably) that I am a racial
minority. I am saddened, and more than a bit shocked, to realize that
over the past few years, it is on the Poetics list itself that I have
most frequently experienced this awareness of my own race--of being, as
it were, the only Asian American in the room. Frankly, the Poetics list
is still dominated by the voices of white men; other voices are rarely
heard, and when they are, they tend to be ignored or shouted down."

and=20

"In last week's discussions, one list member noted that he was
operating on the discussion that no one on this list is a racist. After
the many, many incidents of anti-Asian rhetoric I have seen here, I
fear that I can no longer be so confident about that sentiment. For me,
the costs of remaining a member of the Poetics list have come to
outweigh the benefits."

Please read the entire note here:

and

"It appears to me that Tim's sadness results from the fact that he found
close-mindedness and felt an absence of transformative potential
through the discussions on the Listserv. One can easily find this
disappointment justified merely by noting the relative lack of Listserv
reactions to Tim's long, intelligent, and heartfelt post on the
Listserv. The Listserv has clearly intellectually and emotionally
disengaged itself from him. It is not the vibrant community that Tim
desired.

Such is often the case with almost all message boards
and listservs. Look around the internet, and you will find that racism
and sexism, largely divorced from intellectual content, are constants
on the vast majority of message boards."

Now what is it you believe that I'm kidding about, George? Let's face it,
you and Daphne and Fred sort of seeded the ground for the reception of
language writing/poetry through Tallman's class, didn't you? Also, right in
your back yard is the Kootenay School of Writing from whose august halls

Still more boiled down. We're writers. We talk about language.
Sometimes we disagree. It's a messy business, but it's what we do.

Except indifference? Surely it generated indifference?

But no matter.

Because art is invisible, indifference does not always signify acute
perception. Even when art is visible, this is true. Just because even the
whole world is initially indifferent does not mean much, sometimes. The
twist is sometimes incomprehensible for a while, foreign, not obviously
relevant, emotionally unrecognized, yadayada.

I don't see 'generativeness' as a useful measure of artistic quality.
Instead, think of it as a property that some art has for some people and not
for others. A kind of joint property shared by the work and some people.
They connected somehow. Com port not null.

Or, if we use the definition I used of generativeness (which is how i
normally use it concerning art), then think of generativeness as a property
works of art are said to have when they themselves somehow generate art
algorithmically. This is not a judgement but a categorization by other
criteria.

I don't think Halvard was being petty. He made an observation that occurred
to me also. Namely, if you use generativeness as a criterion to determine
what's great art or even just art, you begin the construction with
difficulties, big leaks in the hull. If I'm not mistaken, that ship has
never sailed to glory. It just doesn't really lend itself to being used in
such a way. Not to say it isn't a useful distinction, but the tool can be
formulated more objectively, particularly when generativeness isn't made to
be measured by vague audience reaction (anything other than indifference is
generative? then it is a distinction without significant difference, in the
scheme of things, because all we can say is it's generative if it got a
reaction other than indifference. yet if we stay with it needing to generate
writing or whatever in the audience then we have the case Halvard raised.).

For those interested, here are examples of what I'll call a "fresh wave" of visual poetry (and I use visual poetry, because I think, and this is my need, that vispo sounds too sterile for my liking) - along with a poem not otherwise found online (as it first appeared in Noon #4).

Hope you enjoy. Will say thanks ahead of time to those who do opt to visit. Incidentally, this online journal is really worth a look. Matina Stamatakis does an exceptional job with it.

I would take reflection as "generative" in that way. It is producing
something. I would argue that if it produced indifference, though, it's not
really generative of anything.

Thanks for the clarification.

When some people call art 'generative', they mean it stimulates them to
write or whatever. I take it that's your usage, Troy.

But the term 'generative art' has another meaning. It refers to a type
of art where the work of art, itself, generates not a response in the audience
but the visible or audible (or whatever) manifestation of the viewed work of
art. So, typically, this sort of work of art is an executable, digital work, an
app, a program, though it needn't be. Could be an analog machine or perhaps,
on a more conceptual level, injunctions to do this or that. Though, in that
case, the piece itself is not really doing the 'generation' and it
probably wouldn't be of much interest to people interested in
'generative art'.

Just to clarify the term.

On another note. A work could stimulate others to reflect. That needn't be
stimulating them to create.

Would that be 'generative' in your sense? Is that of value? If so, and
it is not generative, then not all art is generative in your sense.

i also recommend the Canadian site Ditchpoetry.com which includes a

From my boiled-down perspective, one person used a term that another list m=

found problematic.=A0 The latter said so.

Several list members reacted to the questioning of said term with rote stra=
ins
of resistance -- i.e.=A0 the don't-censor-me mentality, my intentions
weren't racist, other questionable-&-possibly-racist terms exist &
here's a list.=A0=20

Some list members acknowledged that the use of the term is problematic and
noted the need to be sensitive about using such terms.=A0=20

The aforementioned list members found the sympathetic response to be ... wo=
rth
ignoring.=A0=20
In a world where institutions were built on racism and where those same
institutions continue to reflect & rely on that racism & its underlying
sentiments (whether you're a skinhead or not) we should be open to calls fo=
r
sensitivity, even if we didn't mean to imply anything racist or were unawar=
e
of how our language use might be problematic.=A0 Such calls for sensitivity
should certainly not be dismissed just because they are about being human a=
nd
possibly even admitting our vulnerability --rather than such calls being se=
en as
the usual targets to attack so that one might show off his intellectual
prowess.=A0=20

This kind of discussion has carried on before on the list, and in the ensui=
ng
discussion, many have left due to the expression of further racist sentimen=
t and
the denial of granting that a) we might be ignorant of the implications of =
some
terms and b) maybe we should be more sensitive when someone points out some=
thing
we've said that could be offensive.=A0=20

Despite how often we forget it, history tells us something.=A0 I'm still
trying to learn, and if admitting ignorance, even about the implications of=
 my
actions helps, then I'll pull out the mirror.=A0 Take a peek at some of wha=
t
Tim Yu and others have said about the last race discussion on Poetics:

An excerpt:

"As an Asian American, I often have the (dubious) privilege of being
able to "pass" in everday life, with my race unremarked upon on the
street or in my workplace. There are moments, however, when this is not
possible--when I become aware (often uncomfortably) that I am a racial
minority. I am saddened, and more than a bit shocked, to realize that
over the past few years, it is on the Poetics list itself that I have
most frequently experienced this awareness of my own race--of being, as
it were, the only Asian American in the room. Frankly, the Poetics list
is still dominated by the voices of white men; other voices are rarely
heard, and when they are, they tend to be ignored or shouted down."

and=20

"In last week's discussions, one list member noted that he was
operating on the discussion that no one on this list is a racist. After
the many, many incidents of anti-Asian rhetoric I have seen here, I
fear that I can no longer be so confident about that sentiment. For me,
the costs of remaining a member of the Poetics list have come to
outweigh the benefits."

Please read the entire note here:
http://tympan.blogspot.com/2005/03/why-i-finally-quit-poetics-list.html

and

"It appears to me that Tim's sadness results from the fact that he
found
close-mindedness and felt an absence of transformative potential
through the discussions on the Listserv. One can easily find this
disappointment justified merely by noting the relative lack of Listserv
reactions to Tim's long, intelligent, and heartfelt post on the
Listserv. The Listserv has clearly intellectually and emotionally
disengaged itself from him. It is not the vibrant community that Tim
desired.

Such is often the case with almost all message boards
and listservs. Look around the internet, and you will find that racism
and sexism, largely divorced from intellectual content, are constants
on the vast majority of message boards."

Mark,

Yes, we're writers who, by signing up to be members of this listserv, have =
joined a community of writers.=A0 Self righteous indignation as a response =
to someone asking for a little sensitivity when it comes to issues of race =
doesn't exactly work towards respecting group decorum.=A0=20

As members of this community, do we care if we ostracize other members, eve=
n if only to=A0 maintain our right to be obtuse to other member's concerns?=
=A0 Are we so certain of our positions on exactly how language works, esp w=
hen we use it, that we must let Obododimma Oha know just how wrong he is to=
 express his consternation over the use of a term within this community? =
=A0 Do we even bother to wonder if we've insulted other list members?=A0=A0=
=20

You may disagree with Oha and determine that the term has no racist implica=
tions, but the fact that, as a list member, he pointed out that the usage c=
arries offense to him is a valid complaint that certainly did not warrant s=
ome of the opportunistic bravado sent in reply.=A0=20

It's easy to dismiss others when the offense is "unintentional" or not aime=
d at us.=A0=A0 And easy to write it off as the 'messy business of language,=
' regardless of just who we're using it around and who we think it simply s=
houldn't offend, despite their saying otherwise -- which is exactly the abs=
tracted mentality that ignores who we're talking with and gets us into all =
manner of nastiness on a daily basis in the name of being "misunderstood."

I presume that you write as list owner, not as list member, which
might account for the ex-cathedra tone. In either case, you might
want to avoid condescending (even therapeutic--"admitting our
vulnerability?") and extraordinarily self-righteous characterizations
of views you disagree with--they're a form of ad homina. This is not
a flame war, and there's no need to light fires.

Stephen Vincent, in raising "gypped," captured what I think is the
essence of the issue. The word's origin is profoundly racist, and
refers to a group with a long history of discrimination,
characterizing it in terms that have caused enormous misery. If it
were a more recent usage we most of us would try to reform it out of
existence, but the word is so deeply embedded in the language that
it's hard to imagine that many even associate it with the Roma,
though I'd guess the Roma aren't happy about it. It's even harder to
imagine it disappearing from the language. Nigerian scam is of a
different order--a term that I doubt I've ever used before this
discussion, by the way. Its origin is neither racist nor
anti-Nigerian, and its use is limited denotatively and hasn't bled,
and isn't likely to, into attitudes towards Nigerians in general.
Though I'm of course sorry that Obododimma finds it offensive, it
remains the very circumscribed term that we've got.

Distinctions are what discussion is about. We don't need to agree,
but discussing a contested term I would think is one function of a
writers' list. Examples are a part of the discussion--they help us
separate the apples and oranges.

Mark

PS. I do have attitudes towards Nigeria, perhaps because of my age
more richly textured than those of many on the list, although I've
never been there. The term Nigerian scam isn't a part of those
attitudes. When I was in high school a Nigerian exchange student
lived with us for a few months. We became good friends. His father
was head master of a very English-style boarding school, purportedly
the most prestigious in the country, and Aloy regaled me with stories
of student pranks and harsh discipline. He spoke Latin, which I
envied, though not as much as his ability to open a beer bottle with
his teeth. Aloy was Ibo, and we lost contact during the Biafra war,
like many of Nigeria's woes a delayed product of colonial rule, when
separate entities and cultures were yoked together for administrative
convenience. It was something of a proxy war, as well. The Moslem
Hausa of the dry north were the majority, and had all the guns,
though most of the resources and money were in the south. Much of the
US support for Biafra was, I think, motivated by a sense that the
Christian Ibo were like "us." Which is not to negate the considerable
pain that caused the Biafrans to attempt to secede. New York's WBAI
reported the bombings and starvation by live radio feeds. It was
horrific--over a million people died. Since then I've followed the
often-unpleasant news from Nigeria, which I'm aware can't be the
whole picture. In an unfair world West Africans are on the short end.

Steve Vincent's luminous "African Cycle," in his book "Walking,"
which I'm proud to have published,formed a more pleasant part of my
imagined Nigeria.

None of this has to do with what was a discussion of language and the
limited flexibility oif language, which is why I didn't raise it.

 Obododimma & Others,

I have taken much from this discussion. I think just talking about this, no
matter the timbre of our responses, has given me the chance to discuss
language and its repercussions...something I rarely get to do otherwise.

I didn't want to come into this debate, but it seems to me that Mark Weiss
really has an orientation in language use that he thinks is entirely healthy
and cannot accommodate to others. Quite unfortunate. I thought that, by
referring to his age, he should be helping us (who are supposedly younger)
to be a little more cautious in our use of words. I was amazed when I came
across terms such as "Moslem Hausa" and "Christian Ibo" in his post that I
am responding to. Shocking! Maybe he doesn't know that millions of Hausa
people are Christians! And maybe he doesn't know that some Igbo (not "Ibo")
people are Muslims (one of my cousins is!), adherents of African Traditional
Religion, Eckists, Guru Maharajists, etc. How then can he characterize a
whole ethnic group like the Hausa as being Muslim? Yes, it is true that many
Hausa people are Muslims, but that does not make the whole group Muslim. I
am afraid that in using the term, Mark has become a victim of the political
rhetoric that tries to use religion as shibboleth. It is such shibboleth
that Ojukwu's war rhetoric tried to arm itself with, to attract
international Christian sympathy during the war. I am Igbo myself and did
support the Biafran cause, but now, as somebody with a PhD in Stylistics
(specifically in War Rhetoric and a criminologist), I can, without appearing
disloyal to Biafra, tell what Ojukwu was trying to do when he used the terms
"Muslim Hausa Fulani" or "Islamic North". It would be a pity if the
politician is now more clever than the poet the vates, the seer, the
everything! But Mark is not a politician and should know the cost of words
in the marketplace of meaning making.Mark, please, don't take offence at
this: think seriously about your tendency to stick to your views, and
refusal to welcome the fact that you could learn from another person!Be
well, poet.
Obododimma.

Mark,
=A0
I'm writing as a member of this listserv community=A0who is slightly appall=
ed and very=A0bewildered=A0by the lack of care & concern=A0evidenced sent i=
n a number of=A0replies to Oha.=A0=20
=A0
And yes, I have indeed thought much of Oha's request and analyzed my experi=
ence with the term, which is limited too.=A0 You might recall that my initi=
al response to Oha was one of=A0surprise, apology, and a note to say that I=
 hadn't thought of the implications of using the term.=A0=20
=A0
Since then, my conclusion is that a) all email scams do not originate in Ni=
geria, but in fact, originate from everywhere, including the U.S., =A0b) I =
don't refer to email scams that originate from elsewhere as=A0"British Scam=
s" or "American scams", and c) isn't it simply easier, and more respectful =
as per Oha's request, to refer to these scams as "email scams", both here i=
n this community and elsewhere?=A0=A0 How hard is it to acknowledge the ris=
k, make=A0the switch, and let Oha know his note made=A0me think?=A0 =A0Why =
must he receive belligerence?=A0 I'm amazed at his consistent grace and civ=
ility through all of this.=A0=20
=A0
My sense is, after much discussion with my students about the topic, that t=
he average American doesn't know much about Nigeria or Nigerian culture, my=
self included.=A0 So why would I risk perpetuating the negativity that goes=
 with calling email scams, "Nigerian scams?"=A0 Similarly, many Americans d=
idn't have much reference when they heard the word "Arab."=A0 Post 9/11, we=
've got "Arab terrorists," which=A0has pretty much become synonymous with "=
Arabs" in our culture now (of course, generally speaking), and look at the=
=A0negativity that term generates.=A0=20
=A0
Are all terrorists "Arab"?=A0 Are all Arabs=A0"terrorists"?=A0 Are all emai=
l scams=A0perpetuated by=A0"Nigerians?"=A0 Are all Nigerians=A0email scamme=
rs?=A0 =A0When I find it difficult to come up with much to say about Nigeri=
a, I don't want my limited vocabulary to be about=A0Nigerian scams after al=
l, nor do I want to reinforce that vocabulary elsewhere.=A0 This was no gre=
at leap nor=A0grave concession.=A0 Moreover,=A0what grieves me, again,=A0ar=
e the=A0resistances to=A0the validity of=A0Oha's request=A0sent in the face=
 of what could only=A0have been=A0a difficult one to make.=A0 And now, the =
refusal to acknowledge that this list has a history of such resistance--and=
 that we may be carrying on tradition.=A0=20
=A0
Be well,

Now, if I were to answer your point in a generative manner, I would point out that Picasso has in fact caused me to write poems, so his work is cross-generative. I've also been influenced to write works based on feelings evoked by music. Keats' "Ode on a Grecian Urn" was a result of his having gone to see a show of Greek artifacts. An art work does not have to be generative into the same art form, and it does not have to make everyone be generative of art work, either -- though telling others about what you experienced is also a form of generativeness many non-artists can and do engage in.

I clarified a bit in my response to Halvard what I meant by "generative" in the sense I was using it. Not everyone can be artistically generative. Some people just feel the need to share in a positive manner what they experienced. "To generate" is to grow and to reproduce. So let me go further: neither indifference nor a negative reaction to a work is generative (and I'm not sure "indifference" can be generated -- it seems to me to be a neutral state and not an emotional state at all). A work that is generative in this sense, then, is also a beautiful work. I was thinking of Elaine Scarry's comment in On Beauty that the experience of beauty makes you want to reproduce it. That can be as simple as telling others about it, getting others to come share it with you, etc., or as complex as writing a symphony or a sonnet or making a sculpture of a painting in response to it. A work that is generative for me is not necessarily one that influences me to make
 another work of the same kind -- or even results in an immediate response in some other genre. Things are not so linear and clear-cut that way. There is no linear cause-and-effect in artistic influence, inspiration, etc.

Except indifference? Surely it generated indifference?

But no matter.

Because art is invisible, indifference does not always signify acute
perception. Even when art is visible, this is true. Just because even the
whole world is initially indifferent does not mean much, sometimes. The
twist is sometimes incomprehensible for a while, foreign, not obviously
relevant, emotionally unrecognized, yadayada.

I don't see 'generativeness' as a useful measure of artistic quality.
Instead, think of it as a property that some art has for some people and not
for others. A kind of joint property shared by the work and some people.
They connected somehow. Com port not null.

Or, if we use the definition I used of generativeness (which is how i
normally use it concerning art), then think of generativeness as a property
works of art are said to have when they themselves somehow generate art
algorithmically. This is not a judgement but a categorization by other
criteria.

I don't think Halvard was being petty. He made an observation that occurred
to me also. Namely, if you use generativeness as a criterion to determine
what's great art or even just art, you begin the construction with
difficulties, big leaks in the hull. If I'm not mistaken, that ship has
never sailed to glory. It just doesn't really lend itself to being used in
such a way. Not to say it isn't a useful distinction, but the tool can be
formulated more objectively, particularly when generativeness isn't made to
be measured by vague audience reaction (anything other than indifference is
generative? then it is a distinction without significant difference, in the
scheme of things, because all we can say is it's generative if it got a
reaction other than indifference. yet if we stay with it needing to generate
writing or whatever in the audience then we have the case Halvard raised.).

hasn't Harold Bloom been saying something about generative art for the longest???....
He refers to it as "the anxiety of influence."

Pettiness and purposefully missing the point are also not generative.

1. DICHTEN =3D, NO. 10:  16 NEW (TO AMERICAN READERS) POETS
translated from the German by A. Duncan, T. Frazer, N. Grindell, C. =20
Hawkey & R. Waldrop
Poetry, 144 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 978-1-886224-92-6
original paperback $14
Publication date: December 15, 2008

A magazine issue with poems by Ann Cotton, Franz Josef Czernin, =20
Michael Donhauser, Ute Eisinger, Daniel Falb, Hendrik Jackson, Marget =20=

Kreidl, Bert Papenfuss, Steffen Popp, Monika Rinck, Farhad Showghi, =20
Hans Thill, Raphael Urweider, Anja Utler, Ron Winkler, and Uljana Wolf.

The poets in this issue, mostly in their thirties and forties, show =20
great formal diversity. The works range from the sound explorations =20
of Anja Utler to the camp sonnets of Ann Cotten; from Czernin=92s puns =20=

and permutations to Rinck=92s and Falb=92s deceptively simple parlando; =20=

from Donhauser=92s grammatical disruptions to Papenfuss=92s baroque =
lists =20
and =93sassy East tone.=94 But they all share a concern with form and =20=

with language as material. The poets have also all received at least =20
one prize.


2. S=E9rie d=92Ecriture #21:
Isabelle Baladine Howald
SECRET OF BREATH
translated from the French by El=E9na Rivera
Poetry, 64 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 978-1-886224-91-9  original paperback $14
Publication date: December 15, 2008

SECRET OF BREATH is a suite for two voices =97 a voice from outside and =20=

a voice from inside, a voice of the living and a voice of the dying =97 =20=

in a race against death and toward death. Caught in a narrative frame =20=

and a landscape marked by war, snow, cold, speed, and separation, =20
these two voices, even while facing death, embody the approach of =20
love. The secret of breath is as much a kiss as a last sigh.

ISABELLE BALADINE HOWALD lives and works in Strasbourg, where she =20
directs the =93Philosophical and Literary Encounters=94 of the Librairie =
=20
Kl=E9ber. Her books of poetry include LES NOMS, TR=C8S BAS (A Passage, =20=

1986) and LES ETATS DE LA D=C9MOLITION (Editions Jacques Br=E9mond, =20
2002). Our present volume, SECRET DES SOUFFLES, is her most recent =20
book (=E9ditions Melville, 2004).

EL=C9NA RIVERA  was born in Mexico City and spent her childhood, to the =20=

age of thirteen, in Paris. She is the author of MISTAKES, ACCIDENTS =20
AND A WANT OF LIBERTY (Barque Press, 2006) and SUGGESTIONS AT EVERY =20
TURN (Seeing Eye Books, 2005). Her translations have appeared in the =20
CHICAGO REVIEW and CIRCUMFERENCE: POETRY IN TRANSLATION. She was =20
recently awarded the 2007 Witter Bynner Poetry Translator Residency =20
at the Santa Fe Institute for the Arts.


3. S=E9rie d=92Ecriture Supplement #5
Anne Portugal
QUISITE MOMENT
translated from the French by Rosmarie Waldrop
Poetry, 24 pages, offset, saddlestitched
ISBN 978-1-886224-95-7 chapbook $8
Publication date: December 15, 2008

As Anne Portugal has said, her poetry breaks with elevated subjects =20
as well as with the beauty of phrases. =93Poetry is is a laboratory of =20=

languages. It is first and foremost physical.=94 Here, she truncates =20
words to give rise to new rhythms, puzzlement, and sheer fun.

ANNE PORTUGAL was born in Angers, in 1949. She lives and teaches in =20
Paris. She is also the model of a famous =93Poets=92 Calendar.=94 Her =
most =20
recent books of poetry are DANS LA REPRODUCTION EN DEUX PARTIES =20
=C9GALES DES PLANTES ET DES ANIMAUX (1999) and D=C9FINITIF BOB (2002). =20=

Norma Cole has translated NUDE (Kelsey St. Press, 2001).

I apologize for my spelling. Ibo was the standard spelling back then
in the US media. Igbo and the half a dozen variant spellings I know
mostly from Cuban sources, and I thought they referred to a different people.

This from
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Nigeria#Religions_.282000_estimate.29,
"Demographics of Nigeria," whose accuracy I of course can't vouch for:


Religious Affiliation Among Major Ethnic Groups

Source:
<http://www.worldchristiandatabase.org>http://www.worldchristiandatabase.org
    * Hausa: 25,900,527 (Muslims 99.90%, Christians 0.10%)
    * Yoruba: 22,921,473 (Christians 60.00%, Muslims 36.38%, Animists
3.00%, Non Religious 0.50%, Baha'is 0.07%, Atheists 0.05%)
    * Igbo: 22,926,340 (Christians 97.00%, Animists 2.00%, Non
Religious 0.80%, Atheists 0.10%, Baha'is 0.10%)

I've left out the rest of the table. If you have better sources, I'd
be happy to learn. I'm of course aware that religion was used to
manipulate international opinion during the war.

I learn from others all the time, usually through civil discussion.
Like most of us, it's not the first time that I've thought about
these issues, and what I use of the language has changed, in part
because of input from others. I remain unconvinced in this instance.
I don't think, as you suggest, that that's because of a character flaw.

I'm content to let this discussion end, but I'm not content to be
insulted. If you want to have at me again, please take it
backchannel. Front or backchannel, you might want to read your posts
before sending them.

Amy & Others,

I still feel like there's been a misreading of what the term "Nigerian email
scam" refers to: particularly, the Nigerian 419 Letter DOES originate in
Nigeria and the appeal, the voice of the email DID originate in Nigeria.
Most people DO NOT refer to these emails as "Nigerian emails" but rather use
the term "419 Letters." Using this term locates the particular email in
question as being punishable by Code 419 in Nigeria, but doesn't assume that
all authors are living in or nationals of Nigeria.

I'm very tired of this, but I do appreciate your more reasonable tone.

One might have hoped that a discussion like this would lead, as I
think Steve Vincent attempted, to a broader discussion of the
remnants of difficult histories that all languages retain. What you
or I or the list think about Nigerian scam will have little influence
on broader usage. It's different in kind, I think, from current use
of the word arab in the US, which is far more toxic than Nigerian
scam and far more globalized, and also not something we can
conveniently drop, as I suspect that with the passage of time
Nigerian scam will be.

So that's where my question, to myself as well as to the discussion
at large, leads. OK, arab can't be dropped from usage because it's
what a large number of people call themselves, and the obloquy
attached to it will pass away as circumstances change, hopefully in
our lifetimes. But what about Steve's example, or the ones I
mentioned, which for most of us don't carry over to a broader
prejudice? What about words like "bugger," originally Bulgar? We
cleanse the language, unconsciously, all the time--Dutch treat is the
sole remnant in common use of a large amount of nastiness from 17th
Century Anglo-Dutch wars.

So, my question is about the conscious cleansing of language--the
sense of what's appropriate usage, and what merits the proverbial
soaping. We don't have an official body, like the Academie Francaise,
in charge of this (not that the Academie has been particularly
successful of late--remember the circumflex?), and the
dictionary-makers, who used to take it upon themselves to decide,
have become increasingly democratic. Any such decision involves the
ceding of linguistic choice. Which means it's a matter of
case-by-case discussion, and case-by-case use. Unless we want the
good old days of not very long ago, when books could be banned for
officially unacceptable words.

Peace. I really do have other things to do.

Mark

Those figures are totally wrong and have been seriously contested in
Nigeria. The best place to go for such statistics is the relevant ministry
of the Nigerian government and not Wiki. We know the uses and abuses of
statistics! I don't know how those sources got their figures -- I suspect
they simply saw every person saying salaam alaikum or putting on the long
gown as "Muslim". Another point is that the Hausa are different from the
Fulani, but some people tend to conflate the two groups. It is actually the
Fulani (whose leader Othman dan Fodio conquered Hausaland in a jihad in the
precolonial era) that are predominantly Muslims. I am away from Nigeria at
the moment and cannot reach more reliable database. The point I had made in
my previous note -- and which is more important -- is that Hausa and Igbo --
cannot be assigned to particular religions. It would be fallacious to say
"Muslim Hausa" when some Hausa people are not Muslims. As a matter of fact, it
is a form of assimilation that the non-Muslim Hausa in Nigeria have all
along tried to resist. The Igbo society, too, is multi-religious and not
necessarily "Christian".
You should also know that today, in Nigeria, terms like "Muslim Hausa" and
"Christian Igbo" are viewed (especially by the government) as inciting
ethno-religious prejudice and violence. We, in Nigerian, have had series of
religious crises and bloodshed, and would view any discourse that divides
the nation along religious lines as wicked and anti-Nigerian.

Tomorrow, if you are appointed American Ambassador to Nigeria, Nigerians
would not treat you as their friend if in addressing them you use terms such
as "Muslim Hausa" and "Christian Igbo" and cite Wiki as your source!

My best regards, Mark.

Unfortunately, the American language writers are much more well known than
the Canadian. Furthermore, it is much easier in Vancouver to have knowledge
due to the presence of Kootenay.

<<
 a) all email scams do not originate in Nigeria, but in fact, originate from
everywhere, including the U.S.,
>>

Who's arguing this?

But what we're referring to is not simply any scam, not simply even any
email scam, but to a quite prominent sub-variety -- the Spanish Prisoner
Email Scam.

That would be an accurate way of referring to it, but somewhat cumbersome.

So what to name it?

I have to say, I'm surprised that no one has taken up what seems to me
glaringly obvious, that the verbal *content of the text of the emails, from
the start and continuing, is glaringly racist, in the originals and all
sub-varieties, playing on stereotypical Western attitudes to the English
linguistic competence of African first-language speakers.

{Jeezus fucking wept, we're arguing over what we *call a series
Web-broadcasted texts that are *predicated, in their content, in a
singularly slimy and racist use of implied linguistic responses.  Leave
aside the moral content of the texts themselves.  Angels weep.}

If I had to put my money where my mouth is, the texts are written by
highly-competent native English language speakers writing in blackface.  And
most likely, originating ultimately in the West.

<<
b) I don't refer to email scams that originate from elsewhere as "British
Scams" or "American scams",
>>

What I am currently deluged with, in requests from Lloyds or Abbey National,
for my bank details, are UK English region targeted scams.

Calling them "British" isn't racist (though it might have aspects of that)
but blurs the fact that email scams hitting my Inbox are becoming more and
more targetted, and misses the point that these scams are angled at a
specifically *English (not a more generally UK British --  Scots or Welsh)
audience.

<<
 and c) isn't it simply easier, and more respectful as per Oha's request, to
refer to these scams as "email scams",
>>

Except that we're talking about a *subset of a variety of email scams.  I'd
be happy to have a term that avoids "Nigerian" or even 419, but which
acknowledges the history of not simply the activity of that scam but its
current manifestation in cyberspace -- SPES[cam]?

As a last point, I'm dubious about Mark's worry about the connection between
being gypped, and the Rom.  I think this is a false parallel between being
gypped and jewing someone down.

[Aside -- Mark, I'll go into details backchannel if you want about my doubts
about the etymology of "gypped" as linked to the Rom -- the OED supports
you, but the dates are totally wrong.  I think this is an example of reverse
folk-etymolygy.]

A good chunk of "Wall Street Inferno" by the great Brazilian =

First copies of the book have now reached me, well in advance of the =

For heaven's sake, people, how hard is it to refer to 419 letters as just
that, as Ryan suggests, or say something like "so-called 'Nigerian' email
scams," with quotation marks around "Nigerian" to make it clear that one
does not personally believe all Nigerian individuals, or the country of
Nigeria as a whole, to be engaged in scamming?

Little bitty scare quotes. So simple. So few pixels. And then we don't have
to get into lengthily digressive discussions of ethnicity and religion as a
way of justifying the original use of the term, yes?

Sorry, I'm a little busy right now, and when I saw spam scam thread, tuned
out, but I want to chime in about

So, my question is about the conscious cleansing of language--the sense of
what's appropriate usage, and what merits the proverbial soaping. We don't
have an official body, like the Academie Francaise, in charge of this (not
that the Academie has been particularly successful of late--remember the
circumflex?), and the dictionary-makers, who used to take it upon themselves
to decide, have become increasingly democratic. Any such decision involves
the ceding of linguistic choice. Which means it's a matter of case-by-case
discussion, and case-by-case use. Unless we want the good old days of not
very long ago, when books could be banned for officially unacceptable words.
from Mark's last message.

One is that "bugger" is to me akin to "faggot" and "gay" in its migration.
It became a perjorative, less descriptive, term.

But the first is that like race, so gender in language, and that I am still
fascinated by the ways languages change vis a vis gender, but also
etymologically and via pronunciation over time -- which is one of the things
I try to make a subject and object in the confiteor project.  The device in
the first trilogy was the etymological synonyms of mystical keywords in a
cross/halo around mystical keywords; in the second, terms go back to
dualities in various ways, but also -- oh, the way that words for women have
"grown up" from words for filth?

All best,
Catherine Daly

I think you needn't worry just yet about my ambassadorial appointment.

All I have to check is the web. Every site gave a similar impression,
except one, which said that the Nigerian census has stopped asking
questions about religion, for the reasons you mention, which means
that there are no accurate figures. See, for example,
http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/toc/people/Hausa.html,
http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/july/hausa.html. There are also
numerous articles on the politicization and general unreliability of
official census figures. Here's one:
http://grandioseparlor.blogspot.com/2006/01/nigeria-2006-census.html.

I have no pony in this race, and there are plenty of problems here in
the US.. If I've been naive, so be it, though shouting doesn't
constitute proof.

It's difficult to imagine how anyone could read my rather nuanced
statement as hostile. Is there anything about Nigeria that doesn't
elicit a hair-trigger reaction from you?

Do you speak for all Nigerians?

In any case, a discussion of Nigerian demographics really has no
business on this list. If you need to keep shouting, I can be reached
backchannel.

Well, Mark, I don't think it is reducible to that kind of "case-by-case"
problematic. To push it to that corner is to still wrestle to prove how
difficult it is to drop that type of language. As a university teacher, I do
not have problem with that, since I know that, in order to publish my
articles in academic journals, I must avoid any form of language that
communicates prejudice (either directly or indirectly). Being able to
recognize which aspect of my language in the article expresses such
prejudice is part of the communicative skills expected of me as a researcher
and one trying to communicate knowledge: I am required to have the interests
and preferences of my readers in mind! I am required to remember that my
readers are not mere fiction!
Moreover, filtering out offensive language in one's writing is one of the
things taught in composition and research classes in recent times. As a
teacher of research methods in my department in Ibadan, I always discuss
that aspect at length with my students (as well as the implied logic in
one's diction). One book that has discussed that communicative aspect of
research, which my students and I love using, is Real World Research by
Colin Robson, a fine text published by Blackwell.
Regards.
Obododimma.

I guess I held out a hope that poets belong to a more elite group of humans.
Sensitivity to the world around us, and other peoples feelings, would matter more to poets because we are more receptive than the average person. Aren't we?

Well maybe this Utopian belief is wrong, but you can still hope. In a real world that allows team mascot names like, Redskins, and Indians, do we all become desensitized to language. labeling, and name calling. Do sayings infuence our lack of respect for these ethnic groups? Indian Giver, Going Dutch, are a couple examples of these..

I still hope not.

Some beastly music for your nedification:
http://vispo.com/arteroids/sounds/arteroidsIDsong2.mp3
http://vispo.com/arteroids/sounds/arteroidsIDsong.mp3

Needs fairly high volume.

You can create beoootiful muzic like this yourself in arteroids at
http://vispo.com/arteroids/arteroids.htm . When you come to the screen where
you are asked to input an ID, put one finger of your left hand on the s key,
and a finger of your right hand on the backspace key. Now press the s and
backspace keys percussively. Experiment with the lament of the doomed
arteroids.

The sounds here are the crys of dying arteroids; in the arteroids game, one
of the 19 sounds is played when you dispatch an arteroid with the language
gun.

I recorded the sounds; they're all my voice. They sound rather beastly,
though, partly because they are randomly pitch-shifted anywhere from normal
pitch to 4 octaves lower than normal. And partly because I can't help it.
Have I found my voice?

First
off, I really hate it when people demonstrate their level of ineptitude
by being articulate while saying nothing. Certainly nothing new.
Relativity is what it is - and it also means nothing has value. Please,
folks. I remember some time ago when someone made the comment that kids
in India working for pennies were earning money for
their families. Well, I didn't respond as I had wanted to...but what he
said was pure ignorance. Now, it would have been easier for me to have
sat down with this gentleman, demonstrated face-to-face just how
ignorant he was, but then...see...I don't have the patience to sit and
write the obvious. And I know, unlike him. You can use language, this
list as a proving ground, but idiocy is that. How articulate can you
be, when you don't have anything (interesting, or useful, or all
encompassing factual) to
say. The world is big folks! This little bubble is gonna break and unlike t=
he economy I hope some of you don't find yourself redundant.

Secondly, to share:

"I am also hurt when I notice how such poor image is being
constructed and amplified by some people, simply because they are
outside that society."

Why
people found it necessary to get into the diatribes they did baffles
me. What kind of arrogance and lack of compassion do some of us have.
Shame!

I
live in China, my wife, Czech, has worked as a reported as had to stop
writing for an important newspaper in her home country, and I have
to leave because I got big spreads in big journals...am gonna say
something true. Have a Tibetan friend who while on invite to Italy for
a reading made a break to Austra (and now lives in a refugee camp
there), have known people who are willing to die for the right to
speak. Why you waste your time alienating people and debating for the
sake of debate sickens me!=A0 What about mutual nourishment, something a
friend, Diran Adebayo, also a Nigerian, once said to me.

AND,
I witnessed, a gang-up...perpetrated, and let's say it, by white folks
who simply neither know or care! If we can use all those terms that
re-inscribe, all those ugly words you have decided no longer hurt, then
hell, white folks! And as a cultural narrative, what does this discourse ar=
ticulate consciously or unconsciously!

To take the current List eye and angst off the 'scam' trigger, this blog co=
nnection goes to my account - including pictures -=A0 of last year's Septem=
ber Christopher Okigbo Conference at Harvard and Boston Universities - an e=
vent that included poets, playwrights and novelists, and some of us who tau=
ght at Universities in Nigeria (as critics or writers).=A0 (Wole Soyinka, C=

ly strong event, partly because it brought a focus back on the postions and=
 roles of Nigerian and other African writers on the Nigerian-Biafran Civil =
War.=20

I thought this 'diasportic' glimpse of Nigeria might help eliminate the Int=

and difficult) looked at from a much different, larger scope.

I would take reflection as "generative" in that way. It is producing
something. I would argue that if it produced indifference, though, it's
not really generative of anything.

Thanks for the clarification.

> Seems to me that art, to be art, is necessarily generative. If it
doesn't stimulate others to create, it's of no real value to anyone
other than the person who made it. Which means it really isn't art. All
art is social.

When some people call art 'generative', they mean it stimulates them to
write or whatever. I take it that's your usage, Troy.

But the term 'generative art' has another meaning. It refers to a type
of art where the work of art, itself, generates not a response in the
audience but the visible or audible (or whatever) manifestation of the
viewed work of art. So, typically, this sort of work of art is an
executable, digital work, an app, a program, though it needn't be. Could
be an analog machine or perhaps, on a more conceptual level, injunctions
to do this or that. Though, in that case, the piece itself is not really
doing the 'generation' and it probably wouldn't be of much interest to
people interested in 'generative art'.

Just to clarify the term.

On another note. A work could stimulate others to reflect. That needn't
be stimulating them to create.

Would that be 'generative' in your sense? Is that of value? If so, and
it is not generative, then not all art is generative in your sense.

'algorithm' is the 'natural selection' of our time. by that i mean the
two
terms have both been widely misunderstood. Widely.

'algorithm' is misunderstood because the theory of computation is more
than
misunderstood--it's unknown and somewhat non-intuitive in its results.
it
gives us some of the clearest statements we have about what computers
can
and can't do, i.e., it gives us our clearest statements about what
algorithms can and cannot accomplish.

The focus of the birth of computing
itself was on what computers *cannot* do. Turing solved a famous math
problem posed by Hilbert called the Entscheidungsproblem, a problem to
decide whether it is theoretically possible to build a machine that will

prove all math theorems. After understanding Godel's work, Turing
understood=20
that the answer to this question must be 'no'. But in order to prove it,
he=20
had to devise a machine that could execute any conceivable, finite=20
algorithm, and then show that there are some true theorems this machine=20
cannot prove. Thus was born the 'Turing machine', Turing's abstraction,
the=20
most powerful but simple machine known to humanity. It was devised
mainly to=20
help prove the Entscheidungsproblem, not to 'invent computers'. Turing=20
invented the modern notion of what a computer is in order to prove there
are=20
some things such machines cannot do. beautiful, eh?

However, while there are things such machines cannot do, there is no
real=20
evidence that we can do them either. Fundamentally, a Turing machine is
a=20
machine that can execute any conceivable, finite algorithm. There is no
good=20
evidence that there exist thought processes of which we are capable and=20
computers are not.

So, Murat, while algorithms are 'formulas', of a sort, they can get
quite=20
sophisticated with a few million lines of code. The power of the simple=20
algorithm and a machine that can make decisions has yet to be really
widely=20
understood. At first glance, computers look like machines that are
merely=20
mechanical, like any other machine, and pose no serious resemblance to
the=20
processes of thought. But the fundamental operations of the computer are

like the atomic scale of thought.

Subject: Discussions of Race and the Poetics List

From my boiled-down perspective, one person used a term that another
list m=3D

Several list members reacted to the questioning of said term with rote

Some list members acknowledged that the use of the term is problematic
and =3D
noted the need to be sensitive about using such terms.=3DA0=3D20

The aforementioned list members found the sympathetic response to be ...
wo=3D

In a world where institutions were built on racism and where those same
ins=3D
titutions continue to reflect & rely on that racism & its underlying
sentim=3D

sens=3D

This kind of discussion has carried on before on the list, and in the
ensui=3D

of m=3D
y actions helps, then I'll pull out the mirror.=3DA0 Take a peek at some
of w=3D
hat Tim Yu and others have said about the last race discussion on
Poetics:

An excerpt:

"As an Asian American, I often have the (dubious) privilege of being
able to "pass" in everday life, with my race unremarked upon on the
street or in my workplace. There are moments, however, when this is not
possible--when I become aware (often uncomfortably) that I am a racial
minority. I am saddened, and more than a bit shocked, to realize that
over the past few years, it is on the Poetics list itself that I have
most frequently experienced this awareness of my own race--of being, as
it were, the only Asian American in the room. Frankly, the Poetics list
is still dominated by the voices of white men; other voices are rarely
heard, and when they are, they tend to be ignored or shouted down."

and=3D20

"In last week's discussions, one list member noted that he was
operating on the discussion that no one on this list is a racist. After
the many, many incidents of anti-Asian rhetoric I have seen here, I
fear that I can no longer be so confident about that sentiment. For me,
the costs of remaining a member of the Poetics list have come to
outweigh the benefits."

Please read the entire note here:
http://tympan.blogspot.com/2005/03/why-i-finally-quit-poetics-list.html

and

"It appears to me that Tim's sadness results from the fact that he found
close-mindedness and felt an absence of transformative potential
through the discussions on the Listserv. One can easily find this
disappointment justified merely by noting the relative lack of Listserv
reactions to Tim's long, intelligent, and heartfelt post on the
Listserv. The Listserv has clearly intellectually and emotionally
disengaged itself from him. It is not the vibrant community that Tim
desired.

Such is often the case with almost all message boards
and listservs. Look around the internet, and you will find that racism
and sexism, largely divorced from intellectual content, are constants
on the vast majority of message boards."

Now what is it you believe that I'm kidding about, George? Let's face

you and Daphne and Fred sort of seeded the ground for the reception of
language writing/poetry through Tallman's class, didn't you? Also, right

Except indifference? Surely it generated indifference?

But no matter.

Because art is invisible, indifference does not always signify acute
perception. Even when art is visible, this is true. Just because even
the
whole world is initially indifferent does not mean much, sometimes. The
twist is sometimes incomprehensible for a while, foreign, not obviously
relevant, emotionally unrecognized, yadayada.

I don't see 'generativeness' as a useful measure of artistic quality.
Instead, think of it as a property that some art has for some people and
not
for others. A kind of joint property shared by the work and some people.
They connected somehow. Com port not null.

Or, if we use the definition I used of generativeness (which is how i
normally use it concerning art), then think of generativeness as a
property
works of art are said to have when they themselves somehow generate art
algorithmically. This is not a judgement but a categorization by other
criteria.

I don't think Halvard was being petty. He made an observation that
occurred
to me also. Namely, if you use generativeness as a criterion to
determine
what's great art or even just art, you begin the construction with
difficulties, big leaks in the hull. If I'm not mistaken, that ship has
never sailed to glory. It just doesn't really lend itself to being used
in
such a way. Not to say it isn't a useful distinction, but the tool can
be
formulated more objectively, particularly when generativeness isn't made
to
be measured by vague audience reaction (anything other than indifference
is
generative? then it is a distinction without significant difference, in
the
scheme of things, because all we can say is it's generative if it got a
reaction other than indifference. yet if we stay with it needing to
generate
writing or whatever in the audience then we have the case Halvard
raised.).

http://www.venerealkittens.blogspot.com/2008/10/alexander-jorgensen.html

For those interested, here are examples of what I'll call a "fresh wave"
of visual poetry (and I use visual poetry, because I think, and this is
my need, that vispo sounds too sterile for my liking) - along with a
poem not otherwise found online (as it first appeared in Noon #4).

Hope you enjoy. Will say thanks ahead of time to those who do opt to
visit. Incidentally, this online journal is really worth a look. Matina
Stamatakis does an exceptional job with it.

I would take reflection as "generative" in that way. It is producing
something. I would argue that if it produced indifference, though, it's
not
really generative of anything.

Thanks for the clarification.

When some people call art 'generative', they mean it stimulates them to
write or whatever. I take it that's your usage, Troy.

But the term 'generative art' has another meaning. It refers to a type
of art where the work of art, itself, generates not a response in the
audience
but the visible or audible (or whatever) manifestation of the viewed
work of
art. So, typically, this sort of work of art is an executable, digital
work, an
app, a program, though it needn't be. Could be an analog machine or
perhaps,
on a more conceptual level, injunctions to do this or that. Though, in
that
case, the piece itself is not really doing the 'generation' and it
probably wouldn't be of much interest to people interested in
'generative art'.

Just to clarify the term.

On another note. A work could stimulate others to reflect. That needn't
be
stimulating them to create.

Would that be 'generative' in your sense? Is that of value? If so, and
it is not generative, then not all art is generative in your sense.

ja

An excerpt:

"As an Asian American, I often have the (dubious) privilege of being
able to "pass" in everday life, with my race unremarked upon on the
street or in my workplace. There are moments, however, when this is not
possible--when I become aware (often uncomfortably) that I am a racial
minority. I am saddened, and more than a bit shocked, to realize that
over the past few years, it is on the Poetics list itself that I have
most frequently experienced this awareness of my own race--of being, as
it were, the only Asian American in the room. Frankly, the Poetics list
is still dominated by the voices of white men; other voices are rarely
heard, and when they are, they tend to be ignored or shouted down."

and=3D20

"In last week's discussions, one list member noted that he was
operating on the discussion that no one on this list is a racist. After
the many, many incidents of anti-Asian rhetoric I have seen here, I
fear that I can no longer be so confident about that sentiment. For me,
the costs of remaining a member of the Poetics list have come to
outweigh the benefits."

"It appears to me that Tim's sadness results from the fact that he
found
close-mindedness and felt an absence of transformative potential
through the discussions on the Listserv. One can easily find this
disappointment justified merely by noting the relative lack of Listserv
reactions to Tim's long, intelligent, and heartfelt post on the
Listserv. The Listserv has clearly intellectually and emotionally
disengaged itself from him. It is not the vibrant community that Tim
desired.

Such is often the case with almost all message boards

I presume that you write as list owner, not as list member, which=20
might account for the ex-cathedra tone. In either case, you might=20
want to avoid condescending (even therapeutic--"admitting our=20
vulnerability?") and extraordinarily self-righteous characterizations=20
of views you disagree with--they're a form of ad homina. This is not=20
a flame war, and there's no need to light fires.

Stephen Vincent, in raising "gypped," captured what I think is the=20
essence of the issue. The word's origin is profoundly racist, and=20
refers to a group with a long history of discrimination,=20
characterizing it in terms that have caused enormous misery. If it=20
were a more recent usage we most of us would try to reform it out of=20
existence, but the word is so deeply embedded in the language that=20
it's hard to imagine that many even associate it with the Roma,=20
though I'd guess the Roma aren't happy about it. It's even harder to=20
imagine it disappearing from the language. Nigerian scam is of a=20
different order--a term that I doubt I've ever used before this=20
discussion, by the way. Its origin is neither racist nor=20
anti-Nigerian, and its use is limited denotatively and hasn't bled,=20
and isn't likely to, into attitudes towards Nigerians in general.=20
Though I'm of course sorry that Obododimma finds it offensive, it=20
remains the very circumscribed term that we've got.

Distinctions are what discussion is about. We don't need to agree,=20
but discussing a contested term I would think is one function of a=20
writers' list. Examples are a part of the discussion--they help us=20
separate the apples and oranges.

Mark

PS. I do have attitudes towards Nigeria, perhaps because of my age=20
more richly textured than those of many on the list, although I've=20
never been there. The term Nigerian scam isn't a part of those=20
attitudes. When I was in high school a Nigerian exchange student=20
lived with us for a few months. We became good friends. His father=20
was head master of a very English-style boarding school, purportedly=20
the most prestigious in the country, and Aloy regaled me with stories=20
of student pranks and harsh discipline. He spoke Latin, which I=20
envied, though not as much as his ability to open a beer bottle with=20
his teeth. Aloy was Ibo, and we lost contact during the Biafra war,=20
like many of Nigeria's woes a delayed product of colonial rule, when=20
separate entities and cultures were yoked together for administrative=20
convenience. It was something of a proxy war, as well. The Moslem=20
Hausa of the dry north were the majority, and had all the guns,=20
though most of the resources and money were in the south. Much of the=20
US support for Biafra was, I think, motivated by a sense that the=20
Christian Ibo were like "us." Which is not to negate the considerable=20
pain that caused the Biafrans to attempt to secede. New York's WBAI=20
reported the bombings and starvation by live radio feeds. It was=20
horrific--over a million people died. Since then I've followed the=20
often-unpleasant news from Nigeria, which I'm aware can't be the=20
whole picture. In an unfair world West Africans are on the short end.

Steve Vincent's luminous "African Cycle," in his book "Walking,"=20
which I'm proud to have published,formed a more pleasant part of my=20
imagined Nigeria.

None of this has to do with what was a discussion of language and the=20
limited flexibility oif language, which is why I didn't raise it.

Subject: Re: Discussions of Race and the Poetics List

I didn't want to come into this debate, but it seems to me that Mark
Weiss
really has an orientation in language use that he thinks is entirely
healthy
and cannot accommodate to others. Quite unfortunate. I thought that, by
referring to his age, he should be helping us (who are supposedly
younger)
to be a little more cautious in our use of words. I was amazed when I
came
across terms such as "Moslem Hausa" and "Christian Ibo" in his post that
I
am responding to. Shocking! Maybe he doesn't know that millions of Hausa
people are Christians! And maybe he doesn't know that some Igbo (not
"Ibo")
people are Muslims (one of my cousins is!), adherents of African
Traditional
Religion, Eckists, Guru Maharajists, etc. How then can he characterize a
whole ethnic group like the Hausa as being Muslim? Yes, it is true that
many
Hausa people are Muslims, but that does not make the whole group Muslim.
I
am afraid that in using the term, Mark has become a victim of the
political
rhetoric that tries to use religion as shibboleth. It is such shibboleth
that Ojukwu's war rhetoric tried to arm itself with, to attract
international Christian sympathy during the war. I am Igbo myself and
did
support the Biafran cause, but now, as somebody with a PhD in Stylistics
(specifically in War Rhetoric and a criminologist), I can, without
appearing
disloyal to Biafra, tell what Ojukwu was trying to do when he used the
terms
"Muslim Hausa Fulani" or "Islamic North". It would be a pity if the
politician is now more clever than the poet the vates, the seer, the
everything! But Mark is not a politician and should know the cost of
words
in the marketplace of meaning making.Mark, please, don't take offence at
this: think seriously about your tendency to stick to your views, and
refusal to welcome the fact that you could learn from another person!Be
well, poet.
Obododimma.

Now, if I were to answer your point in a generative manner, I would
point out that Picasso has in fact caused me to write poems, so his work
is cross-generative. I've also been influenced to write works based on
feelings evoked by music. Keats' "Ode on a Grecian Urn" was a result of
his having gone to see a show of Greek artifacts. An art work does not
have to be generative into the same art form, and it does not have to
make everyone be generative of art work, either -- though telling others
about what you experienced is also a form of generativeness many
non-artists can and do engage in.

Subject: Re: "A Documentary Saga of the Oulipo"

I clarified a bit in my response to Halvard what I meant by "generative"
in the sense I was using it. Not everyone can be artistically
generative. Some people just feel the need to share in a positive manner
what they experienced. "To generate" is to grow and to reproduce. So let
me go further: neither indifference nor a negative reaction to a work is
generative (and I'm not sure "indifference" can be generated -- it seems
to me to be a neutral state and not an emotional state at all). A work
that is generative in this sense, then, is also a beautiful work. I was
thinking of Elaine Scarry's comment in On Beauty that the experience of
beauty makes you want to reproduce it. That can be as simple as telling
others about it, getting others to come share it with you, etc., or as
complex as writing a symphony or a sonnet or making a sculpture of a
painting in response to it. A work that is generative for me is not
necessarily one that influences me to make
 another work of the same kind -- or even results in an immediate
response in some other genre. Things are not so linear and clear-cut
that way. There is no linear cause-and-effect in artistic influence,
inspiration, etc.

Except indifference? Surely it generated indifference?

But no matter.

Because art is invisible, indifference does not always signify acute
perception. Even when art is visible, this is true. Just because even
the
whole world is initially indifferent does not mean much, sometimes. The
twist is sometimes incomprehensible for a while, foreign, not obviously
relevant, emotionally unrecognized, yadayada.

I don't see 'generativeness' as a useful measure of artistic quality.
Instead, think of it as a property that some art has for some people and
not
for others. A kind of joint property shared by the work and some people.
They connected somehow. Com port not null.

Or, if we use the definition I used of generativeness (which is how i
normally use it concerning art), then think of generativeness as a
property
works of art are said to have when they themselves somehow generate art
algorithmically. This is not a judgement but a categorization by other
criteria.

I don't think Halvard was being petty. He made an observation that
occurred
to me also. Namely, if you use generativeness as a criterion to
determine
what's great art or even just art, you begin the construction with
difficulties, big leaks in the hull. If I'm not mistaken, that ship has
never sailed to glory. It just doesn't really lend itself to being used
in
such a way. Not to say it isn't a useful distinction, but the tool can
be
formulated more objectively, particularly when generativeness isn't made
to
be measured by vague audience reaction (anything other than indifference
is
generative? then it is a distinction without significant difference, in
the
scheme of things, because all we can say is it's generative if it got a
reaction other than indifference. yet if we stay with it needing to
generate
writing or whatever in the audience then we have the case Halvard
raised.).

art
is social.

From:    "K. R. Waldrop" <krwaldrop@EARTHLINK.NET>
Subject: 3 new titles from Burning Deck

3 new Burning Deck titles are available from:
Small Press Distribution, www.spdbooks.org or orders@spdbooks.org
www.burningdeck.com
and in Europe, after Jan.1, 2009, from H Press: www.hpress.no

1. DICHTEN =3D3D, NO. 10:  16 NEW (TO AMERICAN READERS) POETS
translated from the German by A. Duncan, T. Frazer, N. Grindell, C. =
=3D20
Hawkey & R. Waldrop
Poetry, 144 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 978-1-886224-92-6
original paperback $14
Publication date: December 15, 2008

A magazine issue with poems by Ann Cotton, Franz Josef Czernin, =3D20
Michael Donhauser, Ute Eisinger, Daniel Falb, Hendrik Jackson, Marget
=3D20=3D

Kreidl, Bert Papenfuss, Steffen Popp, Monika Rinck, Farhad Showghi, =
=3D20
Hans Thill, Raphael Urweider, Anja Utler, Ron Winkler, and Uljana Wolf.

The poets in this issue, mostly in their thirties and forties, show =
=3D20
great formal diversity. The works range from the sound explorations =
=3D20
of Anja Utler to the camp sonnets of Ann Cotten; from Czernin=3D92s puns
=3D20=3D

and permutations to Rinck=3D92s and Falb=3D92s deceptively simple =
parlando;
=3D20=3D

from Donhauser=3D92s grammatical disruptions to Papenfuss=3D92s baroque =
=3D
lists =3D20
and =3D93sassy East tone.=3D94 But they all share a concern with form =
and
=3D20=3D

with language as material. The poets have also all received at least =
=3D20
one prize.


2. S=3DE9rie d=3D92Ecriture #21:
Isabelle Baladine Howald
SECRET OF BREATH
translated from the French by El=3DE9na Rivera
Poetry, 64 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 978-1-886224-91-9  original paperback $14
Publication date: December 15, 2008

SECRET OF BREATH is a suite for two voices =3D97 a voice from outside =
and
=3D20=3D

a voice from inside, a voice of the living and a voice of the dying =
=3D97
=3D20=3D

in a race against death and toward death. Caught in a narrative frame
=3D20=3D

and a landscape marked by war, snow, cold, speed, and separation, =3D20
these two voices, even while facing death, embody the approach of =3D20
love. The secret of breath is as much a kiss as a last sigh.

ISABELLE BALADINE HOWALD lives and works in Strasbourg, where she =3D20
directs the =3D93Philosophical and Literary Encounters=3D94 of the =
Librairie
=3D
=3D20
Kl=3DE9ber. Her books of poetry include LES NOMS, TR=3DC8S BAS (A =
Passage,
=3D20=3D

1986) and LES ETATS DE LA D=3DC9MOLITION (Editions Jacques Br=3DE9mond, =
=3D20
2002). Our present volume, SECRET DES SOUFFLES, is her most recent =3D20
book (=3DE9ditions Melville, 2004).

EL=3DC9NA RIVERA  was born in Mexico City and spent her childhood, to =
the
=3D20=3D

age of thirteen, in Paris. She is the author of MISTAKES, ACCIDENTS =
=3D20
AND A WANT OF LIBERTY (Barque Press, 2006) and SUGGESTIONS AT EVERY =
=3D20
TURN (Seeing Eye Books, 2005). Her translations have appeared in the =
=3D20
CHICAGO REVIEW and CIRCUMFERENCE: POETRY IN TRANSLATION. She was =3D20
recently awarded the 2007 Witter Bynner Poetry Translator Residency =
=3D20
at the Santa Fe Institute for the Arts.


3. S=3DE9rie d=3D92Ecriture Supplement #5
Anne Portugal
QUISITE MOMENT
translated from the French by Rosmarie Waldrop
Poetry, 24 pages, offset, saddlestitched
ISBN 978-1-886224-95-7 chapbook $8
Publication date: December 15, 2008

As Anne Portugal has said, her poetry breaks with elevated subjects =
=3D20
as well as with the beauty of phrases. =3D93Poetry is is a laboratory of
=3D20=3D

languages. It is first and foremost physical.=3D94 Here, she truncates =
=3D20
words to give rise to new rhythms, puzzlement, and sheer fun.

ANNE PORTUGAL was born in Angers, in 1949. She lives and teaches in =
=3D20
Paris. She is also the model of a famous =3D93Poets=3D92 Calendar.=3D94 =
Her =3D
most =3D20
recent books of poetry are DANS LA REPRODUCTION EN DEUX PARTIES =3D20
=3DC9GALES DES PLANTES ET DES ANIMAUX (1999) and D=3DC9FINITIF BOB =
(2002).

Subject: Re: Discussions of Race and the Poetics List

I apologize for my spelling. Ibo was the standard spelling back then=20
in the US media. Igbo and the half a dozen variant spellings I know=20
mostly from Cuban sources, and I thought they referred to a different
people.

This from=20
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Nigeria#Religions_.282000_e
stimate.29,=20
"Demographics of Nigeria," whose accuracy I of course can't vouch for:

    * Yoruba: 22,921,473 (Christians 60.00%, Muslims 36.38%, Animists=20
3.00%, Non Religious 0.50%, Baha'is 0.07%, Atheists 0.05%)

Religious 0.80%, Atheists 0.10%, Baha'is 0.10%)

I've left out the rest of the table. If you have better sources, I'd=20
be happy to learn. I'm of course aware that religion was used to=20
manipulate international opinion during the war.

I learn from others all the time, usually through civil discussion.=20
Like most of us, it's not the first time that I've thought about=20
these issues, and what I use of the language has changed, in part=20
because of input from others. I remain unconvinced in this instance.=20
I don't think, as you suggest, that that's because of a character flaw.

I'm content to let this discussion end, but I'm not content to be=20
insulted. If you want to have at me again, please take it=20

Subject: Re: Discussions of Race and the Poetics List

Amy & Others,

I still feel like there's been a misreading of what the term "Nigerian
email
scam" refers to: particularly, the Nigerian 419 Letter DOES originate in
Nigeria and the appeal, the voice of the email DID originate in Nigeria.
Most people DO NOT refer to these emails as "Nigerian emails" but rather
use
the term "419 Letters." Using this term locates the particular email in
question as being punishable by Code 419 in Nigeria, but doesn't assume
that
all authors are living in or nationals of Nigeria.

Subject: Re: Discussions of Race and the Poetics List

I'm very tired of this, but I do appreciate your more reasonable tone.

One might have hoped that a discussion like this would lead, as I=20
think Steve Vincent attempted, to a broader discussion of the=20
remnants of difficult histories that all languages retain. What you=20
or I or the list think about Nigerian scam will have little influence=20
on broader usage. It's different in kind, I think, from current use=20
of the word arab in the US, which is far more toxic than Nigerian=20
scam and far more globalized, and also not something we can=20
conveniently drop, as I suspect that with the passage of time=20
Nigerian scam will be.

So that's where my question, to myself as well as to the discussion=20
at large, leads. OK, arab can't be dropped from usage because it's=20
what a large number of people call themselves, and the obloquy=20
attached to it will pass away as circumstances change, hopefully in=20
our lifetimes. But what about Steve's example, or the ones I=20
mentioned, which for most of us don't carry over to a broader=20
prejudice? What about words like "bugger," originally Bulgar? We=20
cleanse the language, unconsciously, all the time--Dutch treat is the=20
sole remnant in common use of a large amount of nastiness from 17th=20
Century Anglo-Dutch wars.

So, my question is about the conscious cleansing of language--the=20
sense of what's appropriate usage, and what merits the proverbial=20
soaping. We don't have an official body, like the Academie Francaise,=20
in charge of this (not that the Academie has been particularly=20
successful of late--remember the circumflex?), and the=20
dictionary-makers, who used to take it upon themselves to decide,=20
have become increasingly democratic. Any such decision involves the=20
ceding of linguistic choice. Which means it's a matter of=20
case-by-case discussion, and case-by-case use. Unless we want the=20
good old days of not very long ago, when books could be banned for=20
officially unacceptable words.

Peace. I really do have other things to do.

Subject: Re: Discussions of Race and the Poetics List

Those figures are totally wrong and have been seriously contested in
Nigeria. The best place to go for such statistics is the relevant
ministry
of the Nigerian government and not Wiki. We know the uses and abuses of
statistics! I don't know how those sources got their figures -- I
suspect
they simply saw every person saying salaam alaikum or putting on the
long
gown as "Muslim". Another point is that the Hausa are different from the
Fulani, but some people tend to conflate the two groups. It is actually
the
Fulani (whose leader Othman dan Fodio conquered Hausaland in a jihad in
the
precolonial era) that are predominantly Muslims. I am away from Nigeria
at
the moment and cannot reach more reliable database. The point I had made
in
my previous note -- and which is more important -- is that Hausa and
Igbo --
cannot be assigned to particular religions. It would be fallacious to
say
"Muslim Hausa" when some Hausa people are not Muslims. As a matter of
fact, it
is a form of assimilation that the non-Muslim Hausa in Nigeria have all
along tried to resist. The Igbo society, too, is multi-religious and not
necessarily "Christian".
You should also know that today, in Nigeria, terms like "Muslim Hausa"
and
"Christian Igbo" are viewed (especially by the government) as inciting
ethno-religious prejudice and violence. We, in Nigerian, have had series
of
religious crises and bloodshed, and would view any discourse that
divides
the nation along religious lines as wicked and anti-Nigerian.

Tomorrow, if you are appointed American Ambassador to Nigeria, Nigerians
would not treat you as their friend if in addressing them you use terms
such
as "Muslim Hausa" and "Christian Igbo" and cite Wiki as your source!

My best regards, Mark.

For heaven's sake, people, how hard is it to refer to 419 letters as
just
that, as Ryan suggests, or say something like "so-called 'Nigerian'
email
scams," with quotation marks around "Nigerian" to make it clear that one
does not personally believe all Nigerian individuals, or the country of
Nigeria as a whole, to be engaged in scamming?

Little bitty scare quotes. So simple. So few pixels. And then we don't
have
to get into lengthily digressive discussions of ethnicity and religion
as a
way of justifying the original use of the term, yes?

my own responses to beautiful work vary. sometimes i am not moved to do
anything about it, with it, for it, to it, through it. just enjoy it. and,
if appropriate, send the author a message saying i appreciate it.

sometimes i tell all sorts of people about it.

sometimes the work relates somehow to my own and it helps me with my road
map.

to me, it's beautiful and tragic that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
beautiful because we ourselves always have something to do with our own
experience; to experience beauty is to know that it is in us to experience
it and we share in that beauty; tragic because that beauty is non-existant
to many other people, as though that beauty were less than a ghost to them,
were nothing at all, not merely imperceptible but utterly non-existant. so
that what one person finds beautiful and values so highly is ridiculous to
another. as though, in esteeming beauty, we value what to us is worthy and
venerable but to others may be less than a shadow.

which, itself, is tragic but beautiful. beautiful because, independent of
religion, it involves faith. faith in the value of the beautiful even when
beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

Subject:      my first vista/64-bit adventure
MIME-Version: 1.0

in vista, by default, it is harder to record audio that does not come from a
line in or microphone than it was in previous versions of windows.

howso?

by default, the only visible audio devices are 'line in' and 'microphone'.
to record audio whose source is elsewhere is problematical--such as from
inside the computer itself--without another audio device whose source is
whatever is going on audio-wise in the computer.

the device exists but, by default in vista, is disabled and hidden. both
disabled and hidden. you have to unhide it *and* enable it to record
anything whose source is inside the computer. such as any app you run that
makes sound. but first you have to twig that it is hidden. and disabled. and
how to undo that.

in previous versions of windows, making this sort of recording was much
easier because the device was in plain sight.

when you get a new computer and it has a different sound card than you're
used to and you're new to vista also, it's easy to be confused about whether
the problem relates to the sound card or the operating system. i spent a
couple of days thinking the problem was with the sound card. until it
occurred to me the problem might be a vista problem and i googled that issue
more successfully via this string:

"recording in vista", "audio devices"

whereupon i came across http://tinyurl.com/6at275

I think Cameron Snyder's instructions in http://tinyurl.com/6at275 are
something all
users of Vista need to come across if they want to record anything internal
to the computer. Anything at all. Such as apps that run on the computer and
generate audio. Whether they run through the browser or on the desktop. That
includes Winamp, iTunes, and so on. But also, it includes recording Skype
conversations, compositions you make with online instruments/works of art,
and so on.

The first of the above emails at http://tinyurl.com/6at275 is quite odd.
Cameron Snyder's reply is a bit
off though. My own feeling is that Robert Neville is flogging "Version 7 of
Total Recorder" (mindfully or not) and the rhetoric of sales finds it
convenient to posit "Micrsoft bowing to the RIAA and pressuring the
soundcard manufacturers to remove the "What You Hear" feature from their
drivers. This supposedly prevents you from recording web radio and other
sound card audio."

My own suspicion is that some body such as the RIAA might have payed
Microsoft to hide and disable the usual audio devices.

Or was it simply an ideological statement from Microsoft? I doubt it. I
expect the action was taken after a cash payment. But that's just me?

Anyway, my new puter has been somewhat irksome. It has no serial ports.
Serial is apparently out. USB is the thing. So my printer won't work with
the new puter without a $50 converter cable. Neither will my tablet. Both
are serial. But more importantly, neither Wacom, who make the tablet, nor
HP, which makes the printer, are writing drivers for these old products for
Vista. So even if I got the converter cables, I couldn't get
these devices working with Vista.

The move to Vista is not just a move to a new operating system but,
typically, to a 64 bit machine that has occassioned wide-ranging changes in
things such as the audio architecture of the machine.

It's sort of like the transition from Windows 3.1 to Windows 95 where we
went from 16-bit machines to 32-bit machines. Now we're going from 32-bit to
64-bit machines. These are major transitions in both the operating systems
and a range of associated software architectures. Such as the audio system,
which needs to be capable of even further increasing sample rates to provide
audio that has presence, for instance. audio resolution has been quite low
on computers. much less than analog recording, which we know can deliver
presence (on vinyl).

The good news is that when I've figured stuff out, the resulting systems
have generally performed better than the old ones. For instance, my audio,
the sound of it through the speakers, is better. More good bass, for
instance.

Also, when I record sound, I can choose a sample-rate of 192,000 samples per
second. This is an increase from the old machine.

I just thought it very strange how, in this little story about just trying
to do a simple thing with my new computer, I ran into a problem caused by
the
economic/political issues swirling around contemporary media.

Hiding and disabling the audio device needed to record audio from a source
other than line in or microphone is unprecedented in the Windows operating
system--or probably any operating system, for that matter. It is asinine. I
don't know whether to think of it as emanating from Big Brotherdom or
Dilbertdom. You can imagine the conversations between Microsoft executives
and RIAA executives on the matter.

RIAA: "We'll pay you 3 million dollars to hide and disable that audio
device."

MS: "We will have support costs. And damage control spin doctors to employ."

RIAA: Who's it gonna hurt? It'll just make it harder for the innocents to
fall."

MS: "No, it can be an innocent activity. We would be punishing the innocent
as well as the guilty. And it just makes using our computers harder for the
innocents. We want to play ball with you but this will cost us."

RIAA: "OK, $10 million."

MS: "Well now that you put it that way, we can have a serious conversation
about it."

As we're stocking the house with traditional foods like Turkey and
bicarb it occurs to me that "eat the bird" used to be an American
insult. Seems apt for the occasion, but I can't remember anything
else about it. Anyone else remember this?

L&BH Radio Hour Nov. 25 - Nov 26,2008
Yesterday, 08:00 PM
At the start of the show I was joined by Listen & Be Heard Theatre =20
Critic Maria Vrobel, who talked about some alternative holiday shows =20
around the Bay Area of California.

I spoke about my poem about the Federal Reserve, which someone lifted =20=

and put at stopthefed.org without my permission, and I also read the =20
poem.

We heard from Russ Golata in Florida, with some announcements and a =20
poem.

I played my weekly editorial from my arts news TV show, which was =20
about looking around and making use of what we already have. I also =20
shared a couple arts opportunities. At the end of the show I read =20
some poetry from three different chapbooks published by Listen & Be =20
Heard, "Infinite Love Poem", "Environmental Terrorists" and "a little =20=

book of odes."

Ah, this refers to a particular cut of meat which was so rough & rubbery =
it was referred to as "gutta percha."  Then somehow in the mid-20th =
century, maybe because of metrical affinity, this was transmuted to =
"charlie parker" which naturally in time became "bird" hence "eat the =
bird."  It really means having to eat a low-down rotten cut of meat (also =
associated with prison diets, as in "eat the bird in the can" or "canned =
bird," not to be confused with "eat the bird in the john" which means, er, =
well you can figure it out yourself.)  We're having TURKEY!!! We've made =
it in the New World!!!!

This is definitely (well, maybe: the flesh is weak) my last on the
subject. Note that I've changed the header, which I think was a form
of unmerited, and worse, undefended, editorial content.

You post mixes apples and origins. There has been wide-spread
commentary about the use of American Indian stereotypes for sports
names. I remember questioning Indian giver as a child. My parents did
their best, but didn't really answer the question. As an adult I
assume its origin was in the misunderstanding of what it meant for an
Indian to give, or to sell, property, Manhattan being a case in
point; apparently as far as the Lenape were concerned they were
selling temporary hunting rights. Moveable property gifts were often
likewise seen as temorary, and return would be, from the Indian
perspective, de rigueur. Forgive my generalizing--certainly not all
Indian cultures had the same customs. In any event, American Indians
are an oppressed, and vocal, minority among us who complain about
stereotypes that still cause them serious injury on the part of other
USians. I doubt they care as much what Tibetans, say, call their
soccer teams. As far as I know some Dutch are confused by going Dutch
or Dutch treat but don't feel at all threatened or more than mildly
offended by it. I have Dutch friends. It's never come up.

As to sensitivity to the world around us, presumably you mean by the
term that any one person's complaint (that's what we've got here)
requires the impoverishment of the language, even if the word in
question imposes no perceivable injury on the group that person
claims, on his own say-so, to represent. Obododimma has every right
to ask: "please don't use that phrase around me, I find it
offensive," but perhaps not the right to say "all Nigerians find it
offensive." He doesn't in any event have the right to expect
automatic compliance.

An appeal to academic correctness doesn't alter the case: the
academy's ownership rights to the language are severely limited.
Those who don't understand that have been in school too long.

This reminds me of a frustrating exchange I had with a bureaucrat
which led me to cry out: "Oh Jesus Christ," to which she snapped
"There's no need to take the Lord's name in vain," which you can
imagine didn't calm me down. She almost got a lecture from me on
passive-aggressive behavior. That woman, unlike Obododimma,
represents a very large population within the US who would find my
usage profoundly offensive and would have a hard time escaping
similar offenses. I think most of us would agree that we see this as
different in kind, because of the different power equation, from the
Indian instances. Few of us would cede the linguistic territory,
despite the very real feeling of offense that woman experienced.

Language is always contested, but it, and the contestation, remains
all of our property. Perhaps moreso for writers, which is why we tend
to favor the protection of speech we don't agree with.

The only reason for this discussion, I think, is an exploration of
the contested turf and how we traverse it.

I know and have written about the major American language poets. I have read
their poetry and their theoretical material. I don't know that any Canadian
poet has written anything theoretical. I don't know that any Canadian
literary scholar has written anything about Canadian language poets. This is
just to indicate the deplorable condition of Canadian literary scholarship.
So Bowering, et al, at least I'm trying to do something to remedy the
situation. What are you doing?

For those interested, it's come to my attention that pre-orders of Poems =
for the Millennium, volume 3 (romantics & postromantics) are being =
filled by Amazon at a huge discount ($34,95 reduced to $23.07).  I don't =
know if other outlets are matching this, but thought I would pass the =
word along.

While advance copies are already going out, the actual publication date =
remains sometime in January.  And further information (including blurbs =
from Hejinian, Palmer, Foley & others) can be found at =
http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/10540.php

P.S. The hard-cover -- by far the more beautiful version -- is also =
being reduced prior to publication: from $80 to $50.40.=20

We "flip the bird" we do not eat the bird.

As we're stocking the house with traditional foods like Turkey and
bicarb it occurs to me that "eat the bird" used to be an American
insult. Seems apt for the occasion, but I can't remember anything
else about it. Anyone else remember this?

Which means you get to eat the natives (it's always seemed to me that
the Thanksgiving feast involved transubstantiation).

 Tangent Press is proud to announce the release of

[lapsed insel weary]

a poetry book by Susana Gardner

please order books by visiting our website:
http://www.thetangentpress.org/books.html

$12

"As the title suggests this is a sequence of articulations on the enduring
themes of loss, separation, and messy love: love is always messy. But
Gardner does not indulge in the easy cliches of introspection or confession=
:
here she conjures up an hypnotic, somnambulistic symphony of exquisite
desolation. 'No man is an island' wrote John Donne but Gardner knows that i=
s
only a half truth, especially if you are a woman. Against a backdrop of the
sea the breaking waters of  waves and birth crash  through these pages with
a contradictory melancholic joy. Her island is inescapable but it has a bir=
d
and it is shot through with the vitality of colour and the colour of
tenacious life. Disturbingly beautiful."
--Geraldine Monk

"Architecturally wild and sturdy, Gardner's book comes from a place beyond
fear and despair, from a place of deep proclivity, which is where poetry
becomes ancient, modern, and new."
--Elizabeth Treadwell

 "Susana Gardner's [lapsed insel weary] is an extended social lyric of
longing that refuses isolation because the "grandmany" is all around, in
ancestry and memory and books and and shared future. Gardner's is a languag=
e
that recovers itself=97lace re-tatted, a house rebuilt=97and there is grand=
eur
in the recovery. This is poetry full of heart and intelligence."
--Carolyn Forche

Hello and welcome! Let me take your coat and hat. Please grab a warm cider
and let's meet the other guests by the fire. Dinner will begin shortly. Thi=
s
is the seventh year of this poem series and our guest of honor this year is
Anne Waldman. Next year, we will have C. D. Wright at the front of our
table! So be sure to come back :-)
=20
A Menu Poem:
=20
To have a gathering for so many, a virtual feast in order! The concept is a
menu poem that I would serve if we could all gather in one hall. Each cours=
e
has a poem associated with a food item in that dish. This is a small tribut=
e
to a great poet who has influenced us all. A way we can all gather in a
small moment of comfort together and raise our glasses to honor fine work.

Well, I am looking back at my old issues of the Canadian journal Open
Letter and checking out all the many many
theoretical pieces on language poetry, including those issues that
were devoted to Language
poets, including the famous L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E vo0lumes.

Hi Folks - Happy Thanksgiving - this is just to let you know that I'll be part of a collage group show that opens on Saturday December 6 at the 532 Gallery at 532 West 25th St. in Chelsea - the show includes collages by 24 artists including some by poets whose names you might recognize including Lewis Warsh, David Shapiro, Bruce Weber, the late Joe Brainard, and curators Jeffrey Cyphers Wright and Valery Oisteanu, among others - come on down and have a look - all the information follows - Bob

532 Gallery Thomas Jaeckel
532 West 25th Street, NY 10001

RIPPED AND TORN
Collage & Assemblage
December 6 - December 22, 2008

Opening reception Saturday Dec. 6, 6- 9 pm
Collage is the perfect medium for our fast-paced, information packed times. Since the beginnings with its first champions, Kurt Schwitters and Max Ernst, this humble art form has become the darling visual expression for writers. Recently, Pulitzer Prize winning poet John Ashbery received enormous attention for his collage show. Ashbery collaborated with fellow author and artist, the late Joe Brainard who headlines the show “Ripped and Torn” opening December 6th at 532 Gallery in Chelsea.
Most of the 24 artists in the show are writers themselves including poet/critic curators Valery Oisteanu and Jeffrey Cyphers Wright. Poet David Shapiro is a close associate of John Ashbery. Lewis Warsh is a publisher and poet who creates abstract grids using letters. Star Black recently showed her collages and accordion books at Zieher Smith Gallery. Bruce Weber is the Director of the National Academy Museum.
Amy Ernst, granddaughter of Max, is a consummate collagist, blending elements of figuration and abstraction. John Evans is the eminence gris of the collage movement in this country and shows regularly at Pavel Zoubek Gallery. His daughter India has caught the fever and creates charming visions using her trademark embroidered text.
Other artists in the show include Judy Rifka, Bob Heman, Madeline Weinrib, Tom Walker, Rakien Nomura, Micci Cohan, Laurance Rassin, Sali Taylor, Charles Mingus III, Angelo Jannuzzi, Lucien Dulfan, Allan Sheinman, Toni Tiger and Luigi Cazzaniga.

Here is some new music I made: http://vispo.com/jig/JigArteroid1.mp3

It should be played quite loud. And played to loop/repeat at the end.

I composed this in an interactive Shockwave piece  I wrote at
http://vispo.com/jig/jigArteroids.htm called Jig-Sound.

The composition looks like this:
http://vispo.com/jig/images/JigArteroids1.jpg . See if you can recreate it
in Jig-Sound--or something more interesting to you.

The audio is from another app I made called Arteroids at
http://vispo.com/arteroids ; these are (my) voice sounds.

ja

ps: There is some video explanation of Jig-Sound at http://vispo.com/bc/qt
(and related links).

By now you can see where these are going. A brief glimpse of the Organ
Mountains outside of Las Cruces. A sense of melancholy. The mountains
are scattered, mostly out of sight, presence of an inverted sublime...

lking on the phone a bit before I read the article how much of the French p=
resence in North America is obscured in the US to this day--after all--the =
only common sign of it we found as kids was "Franco-American Spaghetti" whi=
ch made no sense at all to us when small.  (And doesn't really=2C to this d=
ay--)

My great-aunt Irene Trepanier Payan did many years of geneological research=
 and found that the first in our family to come to Quebec to live was in 16=
50.  No French women came for quite some time=2C leading the men for genera=
tions (including myself) to marry Indians. Thus=2C they were a mixed group =
of peoples=2C thought to be vastly inferior by the English who conquered th=
em under Montcalm.

Through time there came the forced expulsions and ethnic cleansing of Frenc=
h-Indians to the US=2C including to Louisiana where already there was a str=
ong French cultural influence that lives still today. (Arcadie became Nova =
Scotia--and Arcadiens became Cajuns.)

Here is the synopsis of Miles Harvey's excellent book--
I include it as a prelude to the piece below it from the Times.
And here is the site for the book=2C where you can find excerpts from the b=
ook=2C letters and best of all some of the art work of Jacques Le Moyne de =
Morgue.

Painter in a Savage Land: The Strange Saga of the First European Artist in =
North America by Miles Harvey
SynopsisIn
this vibrantly told=2C meticulously researched book=2C Miles Harvey reveals
one of the most fascinating and overlooked lives in American history.
Like The Island of Lost Maps=2C his bestselling book about a legendary map =
thief=2C Painter in a Savage Land
is a cosmpelling search into the mysteries of the past. This is the
thrilling story of Jacques Le Moyne de Morgue=2C the first European
artist to journey to what is now the continental United States with the
express purpose of recording its wonders in pencil and paint. Le
Moyne=92s images=2C which survive today in a series of spectacular
engravings=2C provide a rare glimpse of Native American life at the
pivotal time of first contact with the Europeans=96most of whom arrived
with the preconceived notion that the New World was an almost mythical
place in which anything was possible.

In 1564 Le Moyne and three
hundred other French Protestants landed off the coast of Florida=2C
hoping to establish the first permanent European settlement in the
sprawling territory that would become the United States. Their quest
ended in gruesome violence=2C but Le Moyne was one of the few colonists
to escape=2C returning across the Atlantic to create dozens of
illustrations of the local Native Americans=96works of lasting importance
to scholars. Today=2C he is also recognized as an influential early
painter of flowers and plants.
A Zelig-like persona=2C Le Moyne worked
for some of the most prominent figures of his time=2C including Sir
Walter Raleigh. Harvey=92s research=2C moreover=2C suggests a fascinating
link to the notorious Mary Queen of Scots. Largely forgotten until the
twentieth century=2C Le Moyne=92s pieces have becomeincreasingly sought
after in the art world=96at a 2005 auction=2C a previously unknown book of
his botanical drawings sold for a million dollars.
In re-creating
the life and legacy of Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues=2C Miles Harvey weaves
a tale of both intellectual intrigue and swashbuckling drama. Replete
with shipwrecks=2C mutinies=2C religious wars=2C pirate raids=2C and Indian
attacks=2C Painter in a Savage Land is truly a tour de force of narrative n=
onfiction.

    TO commemorate the arrival of the first pilgrims
to America=92s shores=2C a June date would be far more appropriate=2C
accompanied perhaps by coq au vin and a nice Bordeaux. After all=2C the
first European arrivals seeking religious freedom in the =93New World=94
were French. And they beat their English counterparts by 50 years. That
French settlers bested the Mayflower Pilgrims may surprise Americans
raised on our foundational myth=2C but the record is clear.=20
=20


Long before the Pilgrims
sailed in 1620=2C another group of dissident Christians sought a haven in
which to worship freely. These French Calvinists=2C or Huguenots=2C hoped
to escape the sectarian fighting between Catholics and Protestants that
had bloodied France since 1560.

 =20

Landing in balmy Florida in June
of 1564=2C at what a French explorer had earlier named the River of May
(now the St. Johns River near Jacksonville)=2C the French =E9migr=E9s
promptly held a service of =93thanksgiving.=94 Carrying the seeds of a new
colony=2C they also brought cannons to fortify the small=2C wooden
enclosure they named Fort Caroline=2C in honor of their king=2C Charles IX.

In short order=2C these French pilgrims built houses=2C a mill and
bakery=2C and apparently even managed to press some grapes into a few
casks of wine. At first=2C relationships with the local Timucuans were
friendly=2C and some of the French settlers took native wives and soon
acquired the habit of smoking a certain local =93herb.=94 Food=2C wine=2C w=
omen
=97 and tobacco by the sea=2C no less. A veritable Gallic paradise.=20
Except=2C
that is=2C to the Spanish=2C who had other visions for the New World. In
1565=2C King Philip II of Spain issued orders to =93hang and burn the
Lutherans=94 (then a Spanish catchall term for Protestants) and
dispatched Adm. Pedro Men=E9ndez to wipe out these French heretics who
had taken up residence on land claimed by the Spanish =97 and who also
had an annoying habit of attacking Spanish treasure ships as they
sailed by.=20
Leading this holy war with a crusader=92s fervor=2C
Men=E9ndez established St. Augustine and ordered what local boosters
claim is the first parish Mass celebrated in the future United States.
Then he engineered a murderous assault on Fort Caroline=2C in which most
of the French settlers were massacred. Men=E9ndez had many of the
survivors strung up under a sign that read=2C =93I do this not as to
Frenchmen but as to heretics.=94 A few weeks later=2C he ordered the
execution of more than 300 French shipwreck survivors at a site just
south of St. Augustine=2C now marked by an inconspicuous national
monument called Fort Matanzas=2C from the Spanish word for =93slaughters.=
=94=20
With
this=2C America=92s first pilgrims disappeared from the pages of history.
Casualties of Europe=92s murderous religious wars=2C they fell victim to
Anglophile historians who erased their existence as readily as they
demoted the Spanish settlement of St. Augustine to second-class status
behind the later English colonies in Jamestown and Plymouth.
But
the truth cannot be so easily buried. Although overlooked=2C a brutal
first chapter had been written in the most untidy history of a
=93Christian nation.=94 And the sectarian violence and hatred that ended
with the deaths of a few hundred Huguenots in 1565 would be replayed
often in early America=2C the supposed haven for religious dissent=2C which
in fact tolerated next to none.
Starting with those massacred
French pilgrims=2C the saga of the nation=92s birth and growth is often a
bloodstained one=2C filled with religious animosities. In Boston=2C for
instance=2C the Puritan fathers banned Catholic priests and executed
several Quakers between 1659 and 1661. Cotton Mather=2C the famed Puritan
cleric=2C led the war cries against New England=92s Abenaki =93savages=94 w=
ho
had learned their prayers from the French Jesuits. The colony of
Georgia was established in 1732 as a buffer between the Protestant
English colonies and the Spanish missions of Florida=3B its original
charter banned Catholics. The bitter rivalry between Catholic France
and Protestant England carried on for most of a century=2C giving rise to
anti-Catholic laws=2C while a mistrust of Canada=92s French Catholics
helped fire many patriots=92 passion for independence. As late as 1844=2C
Philadelphia=92s anti-Catholic =93Bible Riots=94 took the lives of more tha=
n
a dozen people.
The list goes on. Our history is littered with
bleak tableaus that show what happens when righteous certitude is mixed
with fearful ignorance. Which is why this Thanksgiving=2C as we express
gratitude for America=92s bounty and promise=2C we would do well to reflect
on all our histories=2C including a forgotten French one that began on Flor=
ida=92s shores so many years ago.=20

I have an essay in Jacket Magazine called 'Empirical and Non-Empirical Identifiers':
http://jacketmagazine.com/36/side-j-essay.shtml
This essay looks at certain effects of language that I call Empirical Identifiers because of the ways in which they encourage exegetical closure through their functioning as referents to phenomena. It also looks at their opposites, which I call Non-Empirical Identifiers because of the ways in which they invite readers to participate in the creation of individual meaning and significance from language that is autonomous and non-referential. These identifiers, by enabling a ready recognition of empirical and non-empirical writing procedures in poetry, may prove useful as diagnostic devices for literary and stylistic criticism. The essay examines a range of poetic works from the last century and assesses the extent to which they exhibit a reliance on either Empirical Identifiers or Non-Empirical Identifiers.

Dear friends,

This summer at the New School I'll be teaching a literature/poetry =20
course called "The Muse Singing: Myth in Poetry from Classical Times =20
to Now."  I would deeply appreciate suggestions regarding non-Western =20=

poetic responses to the Greek myths, from any era, any country.  I'll =20=

post the course description below and the texts I'm already using.  =20
Many thanks in advance!

THE MUSE SINGING: MYTH IN POETRY FROM CLASSICAL TIMES TO NOW
Sharon Mesmer, Instructor / Humanities Division

The artful, emotive tellings of timeless myth-stories by poets of the =20=

classical world continue to enthrall us today.  What is it about =20
these mysterious and beautiful tales that has so captured the poetic =20
imagination for so long?  How, to paraphrase Walter Pater, have poets =20=

=93become the depositaries of the instinctive products of the =20
imagination, fixing its outlines and developing its situations=94?  To =20=

gain a new appreciation of four of the most central and familiar =20
Greek myths (Demeter and Persephone; Cupid and Psyche; Daedalus and =20
Icarus; Orpheus and Eurydice) we=92ll first examine their oldest known =20=

literary sources (The Homeric Hymn to Demeter; Apuleius; Ovid) and =20
read short interpretations by well-known scholars such as Edith =20
Hamilton, Walter Pater, Jane Harrison, Guy Davenport and Joseph =20
Campbell.  Finally, we=92ll do close readings of modern and =20
contemporary poetic retellings of each tale and discuss connections/ =20
disconnections with the original sources.  Access to the films =93La =20
Belle et Le B=EAte/Beauty and the Beast=94 (as a modern interpretation =

Here's a picture of an audio composition:
http://vispo.com/jig/images/JigArteroids2.jpg . Be sure to enlarge it to
100% and scroll to the right. The picture is long and thin.

Let's just hope that doesn't also describe the corresponding audio.

The picture is of an audio composition I made in Jig-Sound, an interactive
audio program I'm writing. You can make your own audio compositions at
http://vispo.com/jig/JigAteroids2.htm  or http://vispo.com/jig or
http://vispo.com/jig/hills2.htm or http://vispo.com/jig/jigArteroids.htm ;
you'll need the Shockwave plugin from http://vispo.com/sw if you don't
already have it).

In Jig-Sound, icons that are linked with blue lines play sequentially. Icons
that are linked with green lines play simultaneously. There's a sort of
tutorial on how to use Jig-Sound at http://vispo.com/bc/qt .

Here's what the audio composition sounds like:
http://vispo.com/jig/JigArteroid2.mp3 . Set it to loop at the end. The
sounds are all (my) voice from a shoot-em-up online poetry game I wrote
called Arteroids at http://vispo.com/ateroids . All the sounds in the above
JigArteroids stuff are arteroid death-rattles, ie, the underlying sounds get
played in Arteroids when you shoot an arteroid.

What's that movie with Jack Nicholson as the president of the USA in which
cartoonish aliens invade the world and talk funny? A humorous take on 'war
of the worlds'. This audio sounds like it's from their radio dial. Mind you,
it was yodelling that finally killed them, so maybe not. But, supposing for
the moment that it was from their planet, we'd note that they've been around
long enough to enjoy interactive music. Things like Jig-Sound are well-known
on their planet whereas here on Earth you have to visit vispo.com for such
stuff.

Hi Barry,
I feel seriously hurt by your use of the term "*Nigerian* scams"!
What makes
you think that scamming is a Nigerian thing? Perhaps you need to read the
history of scamming, if you have not done so. People like Al Capone and
other well known crooks practised conmanship in America many decades before
what came to be known as 419 in Nigeria emerged.

I have a fair knowledge of the history of conmanship in America (as a
criminologist!), but cannot talk of "American scam", unless I mean to
insult
that great country. I think we need to be careful in the way we criminalize
and stereotype other societies. Or is that not part of the netiquette at
POETICS?
Be well!

As I asked on a different list, diagnostic devices? Like stethescopes

Alexander is tired, especially given
situation in Mumbai, of the abuse thrown at MUSLIMS. Lots of
"terrorism," as they called it (THEY), is performed by HINDUS . Fact.

Purely anecdotal, but I spent weeks with Sufis, spent lots of time with Muslim descendants from Persia...and always, and they knew me, and there were no tourists, treated kindly.

It is a terrible when we essentialize. There is little solidarity in India. Democracy doesn't work as well as Bush likes to say it does.

It is a terrible thing what happened, more terribe for the ineffectuality of the government there, all care and well wishes sent to friends, but let us not let this situation be exploited for the sake of what is an AGENDA.

?Language Poetry? ?in? ?Canada?

I check the listserv once a month or less; sorry. But I?ll play!

I tendentially define "language poetry" "in" "Canada" as socially=20
reflexive about language as language, and in a globally implicative way,=20
which, by the word "global," means implicative in a theoretically charged=20
way. (So, e.g., excepting love: a book of remembrances [1974], bpNichol is =

largely doing something else; his "letteral play" is aesthetic in a=20
traditionally "nonideological" sense of the aesthesis; so too Claude=20
Gauvreau is doing something else.) Unlike in the US, "language poetry"=20
"in" "Canada" is in a critical dialogue with a common denominator social=20
realist platform for poetry (most interestingly in Quebec feminist=20
writing), and one other difference is that "in" "Canada" this tendency is=20
far more internationalist (hence the quotation-marks).

David Bromige, Steve McCaffery, Alan Davies, Nicole Brossard, Norma Cole,=20
Karen Mac Cormack, Christopher Dewdney (insofar as he appears in the=20
magazine with the equals signs in it). If anyone who was reading Zukofsky=20
counts, then some of Victor Coleman's, too. And I'd say there are glints=20
of the new sentence in Wah's "Chain" that dates from same time as=20
Bromige's "Tight Corners" (1974ish?) that Silliman totes as first=20
instance. And possibly even the hugely overlooked Philippe Haecke.

Magazines (off the headtop): Line, Writing, Raddle Moon, Motel, hole.=20
(Very incomplete list -- cf. Butling and Rudy's Writing in Our Time.)

After the 70s: see the Writing Class anthology edited by Barnholden and=20
Klobucar. But include, singularly and most importantly, Deanna Ferguson,=20
among quite a few others. Also see the East Of Main anthology edited by=20
Wayman that displays the contestatory dialogue with social realism.=20

After the 80s: M. Norbese Philip has found it useful to use the term to=20
articulate her situation of double-address to two differently-constituted=20
audiences (similar somwhat to Harryette Mullen?s situation). Plus many=20
others.







Poets in Canada have read the poets associated in the US by way of=20
catchphrases such as Language School, Language Poets, Language Writing.=20
Not just read but=20

The removal of a society's hopes for building a future for themselves via e=
ducation and the creation of engineers=2C doctors=2C teachers=2C urban plan=
ners=2C as well as the economic dependence on outsiders with such training =
which this creates is accompanied by the erasure of the cultural history of=
 the society via the removal of its archeological and and bibliographic evi=
dences of its own past.

No past--no future. People trapped in a present occupied and controlled by =
others.  A similar method is employed in Gaza=2C from which 600 students wi=
th scholarships to study abroad are forbidden to leave=2C including the 7 a=
warded Fulbright scholarships in the US.

These "Cultural Revolutions" which overturn Past and Future in terms of Kno=
wledge as Power=2C create an immense socio-cultural-economic dislocation=2C=
 in which a people begins to vanish. The disruption of education and its re=
placement by a very narrow and tightly restricted and controlled "re-educat=
ion" performs a "Negative" version of the "Positive" aspects of the Cultura=
l Revolutions undertaken in China and far more radically in Cambodia.

A similar method was applied to the American Indian populations herded into=
 the dead zones of reservations and "schools" where they could be "de-India=
nized" culturally and re-educated as "docile and obediant" peoples now equi=
pped with the most minimal tools=2C and so "useless" and "dependent" outsid=
e the rezervations.  As the Future was being removed before it might threat=
en to "develop=2C" the Past was being uprooted=2C built on top of=2C carted=
 off to museums=2C flooded=2C disappeared in every way possible.

These actvities made possible the "noble" Trope of the "Vanishing American =
Indian=2C" who unfortunetly but necessarily had to be eradicated in order t=
o make room for the settlers and settlements of colonization=2C in keeping =
with the construction of the "New Jerusalm" via allegorical and literal  in=
terpretations of the Bible=2C and also in accordance with "Manifest Destiny=
."

How much "change" is possible in these colonial-imperial-nationalistic exte=
nsions in space of what is already so well known and accepted as a Destiny =
through time?  How much change can happen when the former "separate but equ=
al" policies no longer allowed "at home" turns into the immense support for=
 Apartheid abroad?

Is the "Cultural Amnesia" occuring "in the Homeland"  a blow back of these =
policies enforced elsewhere?

Pakistan Daily has published the list of Iraqi academics assassinated
by US and allied occupation forces. The objective of these targeted
assassinations is to "kill a nation"=2C the destroy Iraq's ability to
educate its people=2C to undermine its research and scientific
capabilities in literally all fields of endeavor=2C to transform a nation
into a territory=2C and ultmately to destroy civilization.

we are dealing with a carefully devised covert operation. The plan to

"It *is* terrible when we essentialize."
=20
I've been living on a few coasts of the Arabian Peninsula for several years=
 where there is a significant South Asian expatriate population. I've never=
 been in such an "essentialist" or "essentializing" environment anywhere el=
se.
=20
Most all politics here are Identity Politics.
=20
The hierarchy is that Muslims are on top=2C next it is Arabs (Khaleejis fee=
l they're the more blessed) above all other Muslims (though South Asians va=
stly outnumber Arabs)=2C then there are the tribal hierarchies among Arabs =
... And we are all familiar with the caste system of India=2C so no need go=
 into that.
=20
Palestinians seem to be everyone's pet sacred cow.
=20
In India there is the Hindu Nationalist movement=2C no different than any R=
eligion+Nationalism movement=2C basically supreamist. Hindu Nationalists se=
e themselves as True Indians (like religious right Republicans and their Re=
al America crap) and that all other religions in India are the result of in=
vasion and colonialism.
=20
Yes=2C there are Indians who use their religious identity as an impetus=2C =
rationale=2C justification for acts of violence: "Hindu Terrorism" as Alex =
alluded. But that is also the outline of "Islamic Terrorism" in India or el=
sewhere=2C as well: as I would define it=2C when a structure/organization (=
not islolated individuals) uses their religious identity as an impetus/rati=
onale/justification for their nationalistic violence. This is also how I wo=
uld define "Judaic Terrorism" or "Christian Terrorism."
=20
Alex says that "democracy doesn't work" in these environments=2C and that's=
 because democracy needs secularism to be successful. Otherwise=2C people v=
ote according to their religion=2C religious sect=2C tribe=2C etc.=2C ident=
ity. However=2C within these (mono?)cultures there is the al-Shura ("consul=
tation") tradition.
=20
I am still waiting for a Zoroastrian to be elected president in the Islamic=
 Republic of Iran. If it's a democracy=2C why not?
=20
As I watched the Mumbai attacks unfold on television=2C the Indian governme=
nt claimed "foriegn elements" were behind it. Yes=2C always blame The Other=
 first.
=20
Then there is this unfolding in Nigeria: http://english.aljazeera.net/news/=

I think of more the poem as an engine similie, where the gizmo hooked up to
a car tells one what is wrong

but -- my cursory scan of the article mostly confised me, formatting wise,
and I didn't see any striking new "tools" for reading

Hi Sharon,

Though they don't fulfill the "non-Western" requirement, I really love some=
 of the poems in Gregory Orr's Orpheus & Eurydice series, to the extent tha=
t I sometimes find myself reading them on long walks in cemeteries.

Are you teaching experimental fiction this semester, by any chance?

it's with great sadness i annouce the following


Hey Steve,

It's been a while, but I am writing on behalf of the Dave Church, who
died on Thanksgiving morning (officially pronounced dead at 1:30 A.M.).
He was found in his cab, slumped over, having suffered what appears to
have been a heart attack (still waiting to hear from the coroner).  One
can only hope it was fast, for I'm quite sure he thought a great deal
about death, and the only part of it that frightened, or moved, him was
"how it would go down" - the direct confrontation with death.

At any rate, one might think of the Dylan song - "Let me die in my
footsteps..." - and think he went the right way, but he was not fond of
taxicab driving, even if he drew material for his writing from his
experiences in the seedy netherworld that many drivers get to see from
behind their wheel.  Instead, he wanted to be remembered as a poet, for
that indeed was what he was.

Not sure where to go from here.  I'm sending this to you because of the
obvious history between you and him, and because of the wider community
of poets to which you have access.

I have control over his drafts, writings, correspondence, publications,
etc., so anyone with an interest in what will happen to this material can
contact me at this email address for the time being.

In the meantime, a biography of Dave Church can be found at:

http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=16312

I'll be busy with the wake and funeral this week in RI, but I'll get in
touch with you when I'm back in New York soon after.

Thanks,
Jonathan

In my recent query re Canadian language poets to which there were many
responses, most of them civil (and my thanks to all those who took the
trouble to reply to that thread - even to G.B. (and know Rob that's not
you), there was one that was of considerable interest. That was the one that
spoke of language poets and experimental poets. Is there a difference? If
so, what is it? And where does Erin Moure sit in that binary?
