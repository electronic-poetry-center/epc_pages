WHITE BOX presents...
TEXTUAL OPERATIONS curated by A.S. Bessa

Carolee Schneemann's
ABC -- We Print Anything in Cards

WEDNESDAY 5 JUNE - 8PM

ABC -- We print anything in Cards, by Carolee Schneemann,
is a small, little-known masterpiece. Printed in individual
sheets of different color paper, ABC--We print anything in
Cards is the quintessential experimental book. It asks the
reader not only to leaf through its pages but to perform it.
Although its subject matter is quite simpleóa love triangle
óSchneemann weaves her narrative with many layers: the
book is a compilation of sorts of personal journal, fragments
of fiction, and a collection of friendly advices received in the
midst of a personal crisis. Scheneemann will guide the
audience throughone of the possible readings of her book.
Pages of the book will be on display at the entrance of White
Box.

FREE and OPEN to the PUBLIC .
WHITE BOX is a 501[c][3] not for profit arts organization.

return to the true chaos

Please forgive me
for not responding to replies by Nick P., Tom O. and David B.

Can't write now
World Cup is on

though I took notes
and I'm packing up.

I thought I'd leave you with a poem that I wrote for someone else. It's
simple and conventional. Not formally radical or interesting as paratextual
intervention into act of writing. Contains reactionary deployment of
second-person singular. That was meant to be a joke. Not that I think you'll
like it.

You and your Hits 2001
you and your failed bonsai tree
you and your Lola cage
you and your Listerine fix
you and your interview with The Savvy Family
you and your last day on the job
me telling you about my mom's watermelon fetish
you and your story about a boy
who was paid by a man to throw oranges at his butt
as he crawled around naked on all fours
you and your story about a friend who found her dog
with her vibrator in his mouth
you and your dreams about Andrew
   from production
who was on a boat baking chocolate chip cookies
they were so good
   tears rolled down your cheeks
the best chocolate chip cookies you had ever tasted
you ate them as you hugged
for what seemd like days


Peace out camerados,
dave


P.S. actually let me leave you with a quote from a Richard Taylor post ("Re:
No Fun") that had me laughing all afternoon when I first read it:

"some people find all life fun (except of course pain and tragedy)."

Oscar Wilde eat your gallbladder out!

behavior of course from somewhere else that gives them half a chance.
squirrels learn bright scavenge, say alive through reproduction. the lone
blue heron most likely starved, unable to penetrate pond-ice, penetrated
by cold. the cats make it to the curb, then slaughter; perhaps one kitten
gets out of the litter unless rescued by humans. subway mice can't live
more than a year; grease, tars, and other toxins, including pcbs, are
rampant. brown rats have greater longevity if they avoid whatever is
leftover, including traps, parasites, poisons, traffic, cats, illnesses,
flooding and fire. pairs of breeding falcons might make it. seagulls come
and go, back to the filth of the polluted harbor. swill harbors infection.

Subject:      _(glost)_ by Nathan Austin, from handwritten press

_(glost)_, Nathan Austin.  (6.5" x 4.25"), 5 hole pamphlet stitch,
dustjacket based on cover of Webster's _American Spelling Book_ (1824), 61
pp., $10.

ORDERING:  http://www.spdbooks.org

K. Silem Mohammad had this to say about _(glost)_:

"I read _articulation_ (or its imagined opposite) as being the book's
pivotal
conceit.  "To make inarticulate, or _sweet_, sounds": _glost_ aligns
inarticulateness with sweetness, a conjoining that performs its own
unlikely
logic.  Here, inarticulacy is both "a manner that forbids disclosure" and a
way to "pronounce more than is needed."  Sweetness, folding, secrecy,
closeness/closure, needles, stitches, knots, fingers, teeth, tongues,
organs--these and other sensuous lexical threads make up an integument of
fabrics, knit loosely together to create a desirous tapestry that seems to
unravel upon reading, leaving verbal ghost-images, vivid but difficult to
retrace.  Noah Webster's own ghost superintends the pages, directing each
entry toward a specialized (in-)definition, a glossing "across the
map-ends"
of speech.  Above all, _glost_ is intimately personal without glozing any
fixed subjective identity on either side of the page, and sensitive about
feelings even when most admonitory: "Be careful! grasping the tongue is
with
care."

But on the inner flap of the dustjacket you can read what Nathan Austin
fronts:

"Noah Webster's _American Dictionary of the English Language_ (1828): a
protracted definition of an emerging nation-state; the narrative of its
author's conversion; an attempt to restore a language to roots that precede
the Tower of Babel.  As such, it can be read as a map of a wilderness; but
it is also a wilderness unto itself, haunted by countless ghosts, within
which the reader becomes lost.  These poems record of a series of
encounters with those ghosts."

The book also has its small debt to pornography -- at his book party N.
dedicated one of the poems to Ron Jeremy!  only some people got it, but
that's ok.  anyway, sex was definitely one of the subjects Webster edited
out of the dictionary but even more the bible translations he did.

The summer issue of moria, a journal of poetry and poetics, has just gone
online.  It includes poetry by:

sheila murphy, crystal curry, paul stephens, damian rollison, james wagner,
bob marcacci, carrie hunter, george farrah, jack cannon, jeff harrison.

It also contains a review by noah hoffenburg.

As always, I am looking for poetry, reviews and poetics articles for the
next issues.  I am especially interested in poetics articles concerning the
relation of sound and poetry in experimental poetry for the fall issue.

Aaron. I see you are "takin' the piss "  (good humouredly I suppose) but
seriously: Alan's work is amazing from simply the sense of the energy and
out put (I know that these dont neccessarily equate to "good" or "qualiity")
and also its interesting that someone is engaged on this sort of - well it
seems obssessive and frenetic and highly charged - "project"  the whys and
wherefores of which escape me as i dont have time to look into it: but
looking back on the emails fron Alan there is certain'ly a lot of creative
energy and the range is interesting .. as I say: I havent time to evaluate
it but parts of it seem quite ingenious: meanwhile I find it hard to get
motivated on anything myself (especially politics: I'm glad that my brain
has "dulled" re politics (i dont recommend it) but its a fact for me that I
get or got obsessed with political matters that may have been important: but
they didnt do me any good)....but I digresss: the point maybe is the way
Alan integrates political philosophic and artisitic concerns and of course
computer jargon etc What are your thoughts?  Regards, Richard.

Richard,

I agree that that's Alan's point, and yes, my boneheaded comment was offered
in jest. And as much as to poke fun at myself and my conventional
expectations when reading a poem as to poke fun at Alan.

I do have a hard time enjoying Alan's work with anything but the outermost
reaches of my brain, usually--and maybe that's the point. I mean, it's
clever in a sense, but it doesn't make me think "how true." It usually
doesn't beg to be quoted from. And maybe that's the point, but a lot of it
seems the same to me. It seems like spaghetti, and not in the good sense
with meatballs, but like shredded paper that weren't even top-secret
documents to begin with, and in fact aren't even really shredded. And as I
say, maybe that's the point. It's so incredibly dumbed-down and so levelled
as to be almost inhuman. I am working within a more limited (and

Louis Armand and John Kinsella | Synopticon

Authors' Note: This sequence was composed during the course of an email
correspondence and remains an on-going project.  Each piece is the outcome
of numerous promptings and erasures, sorties, advances, feints,
overwritings and defacements, pastiches and parodies, rendering a
"synoptical" text whose authorship is ultimately anonymous (--in this
sense "John Kinsella" and "Louis Armand" function merely as ciphers).

Louis Armand is an Australian writer and artist currently living in
Prague, where he lectures at Charles University. His work has appeared in
various journals, including POETRY REVUE, SULFUR, MEANJIN, and HEAT. His
most recent publications include two volumes of poetry, INEXORABLE WEATHER
(Arc, 2001) and LAND PARTITION (Textbase, 2001), and a volume of
experimental prose, THE GARDEN (Salt, 2001). He is poetry editor of THE
PRAGUE REVUE, and an editor of LITTERARIA PRAGENSIA.

John Kinsella is the author of more than twenty books whose many prizes
and awards include The Grace Leven Poetry Prize, the John Bray Award for
Poetry from The Adelaide Festival, The Age Poetry Book of The Year Award,
The Western Australian Premier's Prize for Poetry (twice), a Young
Australian Creative Fellowship from the former PM of Australia, Paul
Keating, and senior Fellowships from the Literature Board of The Australia
Council. His POEMS 1980-1994 and volume of poetry THE HUNT (a Poetry Book
Society Recommendation) were published in May 1998 by Bloodaxe in the UK
and USA, THE UNDERTOW: NEW & SELECTED POEMS (Arc, U.K), VISITANTS
(Bloodaxe, 1999), WHEATLANDS (with Dorothy Hewett in 2000), and THE
HIERARCHY OF SHEEP (Bloodaxe/FACP, 2001). He is the editor of the
international literary journal SALT, a Consultant Editor to WESTERLY
(CSAL, University of Western Australia), Cambridge correspondent for
OVERLAND, (Melbourne, Australia), International Editor of the American
journal THE KENYON REVIEW, and a Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge. A
novel GENRE was published in 1997 (Fremantle Arts Centre Press) and
GRAPPLING EROS in late 1998 (FACP). He co-edited (with Joseph Parisi) a
double issue of Australian poetry for the American journal POETRY and more
recently an Australian issue of THE LITERARY REVIEW. He is Professor of
English at Kenyon College in the United States, a Fellow of Churchill
College, Cambridge University, and Adjunct Professor to Edith Cowan
University, Western Australia. His work has been or is being translated
into many languages, including French, German, Chinese, and Dutch.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

personally I find Sondheim's work rarely interesting,
a nuisance even, but that's also it's charm, for me.
I think of it as confrontational, intellectually eclectic diarrhea.

Hi,

I'm looking to find some "video poems" and/or "film poems" from the 1950s =
on by any folks you can think of whose work is available to rent or (=
cheaply) buy. These texts seem hard to locate and I'd like to show some in =
a class I will be teaching. Anyone have any thoughts on how to find copies =
of these? Thanks.

Aaron. Wouldnt your kind of response be similar to people who first (still
are)(I know when I very first saw her writing I took no interest but later
grew interested) (albeit with knowedge that other's werre very interested)
confronted with Gertrude Stein's work...I dont think one can quite apply
normative criteria to Alan's  "project" (I have to admit it defeats me for
the moment from its sheer size and the obscurity of Alan's "explanations"
but that isnt something new in my experience of coming into new realms of
literature): I say "quite apply", as one can look at his constrctions email
by email: and some seem as you imply rather dumbed: yet they make a kind of
energetic clashing music: I dont know if its good...its certainly better
than a lot of the "official verse culture" which is even more spaghetti
(given that it tries to seem not so): I agree there is a sameness.
  I am impressed at this stage by the sheer energy, however misplaced - an
any creative work be "misplaced"? - and some are quite brilliant: my concern
is (and it is also one with respect to my own writing) epistemelogical: or
maybe it pivots on what Alan is partly giving of himself now, and almost
nihilistic sense of things: a way of thinking in which one is neither "for"
nor "against" which leds to the possiblility of "being a novelist"..that is
eg with respect eg to S11 (to take the Big Thumb example but there
aremillions of other issues) one can be simultaneously outraged and fullof
compassion and horror for the people killed and also see it as "glorious",
or beautiful a la Stockhaussen and myself in a certain mood: its this latter
capacity (or incapacity?) which is probably what enables human's to commit
acts of war,or just violence: given a kind of "total awareness" or
supersensitive empathy war would never happen: in fact its possible that
hardly anything would happen: its the paradox we are locked into: I think
that in that sense Alan is both present in his poems or his work and not:
the truth of what he is doing is what he does, it reflects him and his mind
but is also  a part of  a larger project ...and this, the point of this -
well the "point" should, _should_ be sui generis: but I cant see that that
answers my wish for a raison d'etre...
  This "evealuation" being as much from my own changing mood/moods as from
any objective analysis - which analysis I feel is near impossible - so my
concern re Alan's work reflects deeper concerns about literature and the
whys and wherefores and the possiblilty of a complete void: yet somewhow the
void attracts....dont worry I'll have another coffee: if this isnt making
sense join the club! I think I know what I mean, or am trying to mean!
  If I felt that Alan was simply a "bad" poet, a poor technitian, I wouldnt
even comment on his work: I think the "badnesses" are part of a
strategy...similar to the way John Wieners mixed cliche and revelation.
Richard.

Can anyone help locate a (video) copy of the Steve Allen Show
appearance by Jack Kerouac? While I know there is probably a network
archive of the tape, weren't there also documentaries (of kerouac but
also the beats) which included this performance?

Hi gang

I am trying to find critical writing on or reviews of
the Canadian artist Rober Racine. (What I have is the
recent exhibit catalogue and writings from the
National Gallery show; I'm looking for anything
additional anyone can point me towards)

I'm also look for any writing on Fanny Howe's fiction.

Kazim.

furious idiocies among humans and their gatherings: particles are pried
apart and recombined, the world festers. charred remains in the honor of
gods. we shall be no more. i beg you in the name of gods, inscribe my work
in iron, bury it deep, etch it in steel and titanium, coat it against all
possible futures, remove it from the virtual. i beg you: make my work
real::the heat of the near-future melting wires amidst nuclear explosions,
suicide bombers, storms and lightnings, the destructions of languages and
bodies, desert ecologies rampant down to barren aa melt. humans control
humans; chemical catastrophe at the top down through radiations blinding
and charring animals. sun and moon topple with damaged eyes. viral
particles fly apart; bacteria shudder above ground. all is well in the
cracked subterranean rock strata; dull life moves on as the surface rains
down.:yes, the end of the world in every way, shape, and form: every
ideology, object, and structure. it will come imminent and immanent. of
virtuality let it be said, nothing shall survive. incandescent rock and
earth, lavas and obsidians of forgetting, shall glance across barren
plains, uttering their own inscriptive tallies in the violent suns and
nuclear winters. prepare, prepare. save my work, my texts and images, my
video and sound, above all: download, download, before it is too late.::

Full Video Program:
Typeoclavecin Film-Variations on the Blues for JoJo
#10/  16mm, 2:00
by Joel Schlemowitz, poetry by Wanda Phipps,
Poem by Wanda Phipps, as read by her, and accompanied
by the typeoclavecin, a typewriter as a musical
instrument, built by the filmmaker for the
accompaniment of poets through the technique of
dictation.

Morning Poem #40/  16mm, 2:00
by Joel Schlemowitz, poetry by Wanda Phipps
A spinning, flickering circle of words and colors
accompanies the poem.

When He Leaves/  16mm, 1.15
by Joel Schlemowitz, poetry by Bridget Meeds
A poem with accompanying text on screen intercut with
a contact printed typewriter ribbon.

Sleepwalk/ 8mm, 3:15 by Lisa Barnstone
Drink Me/ 8mm, 4:15 by Lisa Barnstone
These are the first two of a tripdych of films. They
both portray women skimming the surfaces of the
landscape of New York City.

Desiring/ video, 1:00
by Sharon Paz
Each horizontal line in this video represents a
different environment-the land and the sky, the home,
and the body. Through the work's duration, an
apple is transferred from the ground to the sky
through the mouth and back again. The apple is used as
a symbol of knowledge and desire.

Over Above/ video, 4:00
by Art Jones
Over Above is about the physical and social distances
through which everyday horror is seen. Airplanes,
buses, helicopters: these provide the windows that
filter our perceptions of early 21st century America,
where not-quite-seeing has become the dominant mode of
vision. The visual "effect" is two fold: the first,
composited through a helicopter window, is the beating
of Thomas Jones by the Philadelphia police on July
12th, 2000.

The second is a view of a scene from a bus window.
Music by Cibo Matto.

Like the Weather/Forecast Memorial/ video, 3:00
by Eleana Kim/Rick Synder
This video includes a documentary transcription from
local newscasts two months after the WTC attack as
well as it documents "the weather" and our
knowledge of it as a meditation of place and
historical memory.

Homeless/ video, 2:30
by Linda Hattendorf, poetry by Steve Kelley
This video follows poet Steve Kelley as he considers
the possibility of leaving the lights of civilization
for the mesa landscape imaged in the work.

Tongues Don't Have Bones/ video, 10:15
by Lisa DiLillo, poetry by Kyi May Kaung
Tongues Don't Have Bones is a marriage of lyrical and
metaphorical visuals as well as the poetry of Kyi May
Kaung. Kyi's words reflect on the synchronicity of
beauty and terror in Burma, a country that is being
ruptured by the brutality of a ruthless military
regime.

I, too, have been receiving multiple messages from all over the world trying to get me to open suspect attachmnts -- But here's a wrinkle -- I also receive failed mail messages from my Penn State account for posts that I have not sent -- ordinarily this would indicate that my computer was infected and that the virus was using my address book -- but these addresses are not in my address book, and I have been away from my Penn State computer (which was virus-free when I left) for more than a month -- This tells me that the server at Penn State was infected and that the virus/worm is able to send things from accounts without having infected the individual user's computer -- Likewise, I have received emails with these attachments from people who do not have me in their address books and who are not using the penn State servers.

Russian Jabberwocky Translations
Vladimir Shkurkin
My impression is that the best translation into Russian would require either a conscious or intuitive perception of the image each non-word brings forth, and then to attempt to evoke that same image by synthesizing a Russian word with perhaps the same Indo-European roots. As an example, the "gr-" words in both English and Russian have similar inimical images. Russian "grom", "groza", "gryzha", "grob", "griaz'", etc. are negative images. The "wr-" words suggesting rotation or twisting appear in both English and Russian.

Following this reasoning, the construction of words to evoke images becomes a matter of simultaneously evoking the image and making things rhyme, with a coherent meter. Exceptionally talented poets can do this subconsciously, and careful artisans using conscious analysis can craft something given enough time.

The best of the translations translate the image with image-evoking nonsense words of parallel structure, often using classical Russian poetic inversions.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Note:
  The above material on issues of translation (focusing on translations into Russian) was sent to me in email by Vladimir, who kindly gave permission for me to use it "in any way you deem appropriate".
  So here it is. Hope you find it as interesting as I did.

  Vladimir also gave a short bio of himself to explain where he stood "in psycho-linguistic conceptual space" (catchy phrase):


    I was born in Seattle, Washington in 1930, and spoke no English until I started school, because English was forbidden in the home. My parents and grandparents were Russian, but until coming to the United States lived in Manchuria, where my grandfather taught Chinese to the Russians and Russian to the Chinese. I could read and write Russian at a very early age, and later was graduated in Russian grammar (and other fields).
    I was raised in a bilingual, bicultural environment, which allows me to appreciate nuances in the translations which might not be caught by someone just knowing the language.

    Now retired, I do writing, editing, and translating.

Hi, Thomas! There are several Russian translations of "Alice in =
Wonderland" (the earliest one was done by Nabokov, who Russian'ed Alice =
into Anya). There are various good translations of the nonsense poems in =
the book, and I think the best one indeed follow the line suggested by =
your correspondent. Incidentally, all the translations are metrically =
accurate and rhyme (the Russians always preserve the original's formal =
characteristics when translating a poem).

Cheers,
Philip

Dear Mark,

Speaking of sounds with positive connotations: the Grateful Dead. I hope
you don't find this concept grody to the max, although certainly my
Grateful Dead show ticket purchases over the years could have paid for a
lot of groceries.

Dear Joel,
        Yep, the interview is on Whatever Happened to JK?, and is the most
memorable segment of the doco. A mustsee.Steve A is so self-satisfied and
uncool and JK is so boyish shy and alert. That brief  encounter speaks heaps
more about the 50s than a truckload of sociology ...

Can anyone help locate a (video) copy of the Steve Allen Show
appearance by Jack Kerouac? While I know there is probably a network
archive of the tape, weren't there also documentaries (of kerouac but
also the beats) which included this performance?

just in case you're worried that i'm involved in something i
shouldn't be, it's not for me, but for someone from tv-land who wrote
asking...

It's amazing what gets lost in time's translation. I actually saw the Steve
Allen Show segment  when it aired originally. It's good to remember that it
appeared in the middle of an hour-long variety show--hardly an intimate or
contemplative venue.  At the time and in that context Kerouac appeared to
be suffering from near-terminal stagefright and Allen appeared to be
uncomfortable for him. His uncoolness looked like an attempt to jolly
Kerouac out of it and rescue the segment for the public at large.

It took, remember, a fair amount of daring at the time to give Kerouac so
public and so mainstream an exposure. Media coverage had been uniformly
sensationalist and moralistic. Awhile before there had been a major spread
about the Beats in Look Magazine, which had a circulation second  only to
Life and with a similar demographic. Page after page of claustrophobic
black and white interiors, each frame crowded with hairy, unkempt,
dirty-looking people.  They might as well have been cockroaches. Allen at
least was trying to be both respectful and serious.

 Yes, I think what you describe, Mark,  survives in the segment. Sure, Allen
was trying (to be respectful and serious) but that he didn't succeed is a
measure, and not just of Allen. And I'm aware also of the records they cut
together, cocktail piano and Kerouac text, also failures. Do you recall in
the interview an exchange re-Whitman where the stage-afraid K nevertheless
corrects Allen who then loses a little of his own composure, and tries to
reassert his authority? The whole thing is SO nervy.

Subject:      Question of content
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I keep coming back to the question of "content," which I'd like to explore
in relation to the Fakelangpo question, as well as in terms of Alan
Sondheim's work. What is the content of "langpo"? Of  "language poetry"?

Let's say that a million words were produced as "language poetry" by  1985.
An editor comes along and gathers it together through some labor intensive
process (letters, negotiations, book publications are entailed). Silliman's
anthology is 600 pp. long and probably contains from 200,000 to 300,000
words; *This* magazine, which I edited from 1971-82, comprised 1128 pp. and
perhaps a comparable amount of text. What is the relationship of the
substitute "langpo" to that text?

What did this output change, in terms of the nature of poetry, the nature
of "creative expression"? In a digital environment, you could actually
manipulate that amount of text without much difficulty. I just downloaded a
million random digits from the Rand Corporation, in fact (textual device
for some of Jackson Mac Low's work in the 1950s).

What is content? In a post on Webartery, I wrote:

 >>>"Positive content": which brings me to the question of interest here:
if "fakelangpo" were filled with content, in the sense that "content" is
what a "content provider" provides) what would it be? A dream of the great
and strange, warranting page after page of empty and inviting play space?
The redemption of the no longer signifying word would thus generate endless
content.

 >>>Trying to imagine the positive content of the site, then, which is not
yet there, or might have been but no longer signifies, might be
interesting. But, on the other hand, I would not like to think that putting
just anything there as "fakelangpo" would be the right answer to that lack
of content. That would be like reading from the phonebook in a
psychoanalytic session--

 >>>"Sustained parody or critique": implies an original that might not
exist. If it did exist, it would be a matter of historical record that
might be accessed--as content. But perhaps "merely" historical content is
not what is desired. Some other sense of history?

 >>>"But with what?": what is content insofar as it is imagined or desired,
in this environment?

Two points: 1) Fakelangpo seems to express a desire that the structure that
has been created, in a somewhat manic way, wants to be filled with content.
Is there a relation between that desire and the lack of content, for better
or worse, indicated by the word "langpo"--as a completely substitutable
word, but a substitution for what? A "buzzword" substituting for a
buzzword? What is the content of Fakelangpo? How is Fakelangpo going to be
filled with content?

Millie Niss has partly answered this question. She wants the work to be
seen as "fun to read." She also wants reflection on the question of the
content of the site. Putting the two together, reflecting on the question
of the site will be fun, interesting, and social. I think I do see the
influence of Kenneth Koch here (which is fine with me).

A lot of the content of "language poetry," however, is left out of this
notion of content. For instance: historical motivation, critical intention,
aesthetic criteria, etc. Fakelangpo selects out one kind of content in
preference to others. As a reading, that might be OK; as a representation
of the "content" of "language poetry," perhaps it is not adequate for those
engaged in its prior history. But who can tell? How will Fakelangpo address
the already existing content of "language poetry"? Or is an address to
content merely a textual question?

2) I am interested in the way that "content" is a textual question in the
work of Alan Sondheim. I am, I think, in the middle of seeing the extent of
his project. A provisional conclusion, however, is that it often calls into
question what in psychoanalysis would be termed "cathexis." Very procedural
language--flat, inert, sometimes endless--is fused with very cathected
language--e.g., pornography.

In his recent performance piece, he and his partner appear nude. That is,
certainly, a form of content. The typing breaks down, at the same time.
What is the relation of the two kinds of content?

Question to ask Alan Sondheim: if psychoanalysis depends on the cathexis of
language, seen as a string of symbols in a dialogue between partners in
communication who cannot know each others' meanings, could a successful
psychoanalysis be undertaken by the analysand simply reading the phone book
or the Rand table to the analyst? Does your project have anything to do
with this question?

Second question: if a machine were to generate the content of the analytic
session, what is the relation of its production to human desires, that
which cathects the string of substitute symbols? Is desire, in other words,
a machine?

Third question: does Fakelangpo engage the textual production of meaning in
this sense, but as the empty site for textual "fun"?

I am trying to frame a question about the desire for content in terms of
the production of texts. Is this form of the transaction of textual desire
what is being imagined as a characteristic of the language school, as it
has been transformed in digital environments?

 Eunoia becoming a hit among true synesthetes, December 29, 2001
Reviewer: Sean Day (see more about me) from Oxford, Ohio
Christian Bök's Eunoia is becoming a fast hit among those with actual
"colored-letter" synesthesia.

Christian Bök based part of his ideas for Eunoia off the concept of
synesthesia, mainly borrowing from Arthur Rimbaud's poem "Voyelles" (the
strangely-colored cover design for the book is also based upon the same).
In "Voyelles", Rimbaud creates correspondences between colors and letters
of the alphabet (or, more specifically, the written symbols - the
graphemes) for vowels.

Synesthesia is an actually existing, albeit rare, set of benign
neurological conditions. Overwhelmingly, the most common (perhaps as
common as existing in 1 out of every 750 people) form of synesthesia
involves involuntary, automatic correspondences made between colors and
graphemes (letter and number characters). This type of synesthesia is
apparently genetically-based (that is, organic, and not psychologically
based upon childhood associations), and usually emerges around the age of
six or seven years of age. Those with "colored-letter" synesthesia
generally maintain it throughout life, with virtually no variations in the
color-letter correspondences. They have no choice as to which colors are
associated with which letters and are stuck with the links throughout
life. Also, each individual synesthete's total set of color-letter
correspondences is unique, although there are certain trends to be found
world-wide with certain graphemes, such as "A" being red and "O" being
white or clear amongst about two-thirds of all such synesthetes.

Rimbaud was not a colored-letter synesthete; he admits that he made up the
correspondences in his (in-)famous poem.

However, now, true colored-letter synesthetes are finding Bök's book
either an overwhelming thrill or nightmare. To those without this form of
synesthesia, the pages of Bök's book - each page using one and only one
vowel for all words - glare with the profusion of the particular vowel.
For the actual colored-letter synesthete, each particular page tends to
totally overwhelm with a particular color. I have received letters from
synesthetes writing in rapturous awe of how a certain chapter of Eunoia
sweep them with the "icy whiteness of O", or how it is a nightmare with
simply too much red "A" (even though, to Rimbaud, "A" was supposed to be
black) distracting from everything else.

interesting conjunction, Barrettm and I'd like to explore the langpo,
Millie, and alan conjunction some, even though most are on vacation, so
things are rather spase on the lists.

I think Alan's 'Cancer, Mourning, and Loss'
http://members.tripod.com/~trbell/metaphor/sond.htm might be an interesting
starting point.  It can be accessed atthis link for now even though I hope
to get my act together and change servers soon.

What actually interested me in this piece was the content and the way that
his and his mother's and others' feelings came through to me out of the
chaos (of hospitals, etc) and out of the chaos of internet communications
and lists.  While not langpo or fake langpo or porn (all of which can often
be used to mute or bypass feelings) it does have a structure in two
dimensions - one given to it by alan and one given to it by the context it
arrives in - the list it appeared on.. I think in a simimilar fashion lp,
fakelp, and porn are capable (even though many practitioners may not be even
aware fo it) of tranmuting feelings or content (there are i think only eight
basic emotions plus the absence of emotion which would be equivalent of
depression) and expressing those feelings in a 'strangulated fashion -
dimension two noted above which is a comment sometimes on our
emotion-strangulating culture.  The first dimension or the feeling expressed
through the 'poem' often gets altered in these processes and may come out
twisted in the sense that love rendered pornographically often comes across
as sadness.

It is the secomd dimensionthat interests me and I think it is this dimension
which makes lngpo and experimental work interesting as I think they are
confronting life in a fashion that 'traditional' work blithly ignores?  I'm
not sure if anyone is still following all of this or if in my convolutions
I've not just twisted myself into a knot but Im going to put off rereading
it until the light of day tomorrow.

What is the content of "langpo"? Of  "language poetry"?

The world that is under completion requires
the strengthening method of your questions, Barry.

Since content is a selection or reduction
of an unavailable whole, say, the million words
of l-p by 1985 mentioned, an arbitrary killing occurs,
a division which eliminates an integral whole
within the implicate order.

But were we able to stick to the propositions,
without following the secondary associations
(i.e. fake l-po) I do not find a generator of text--
instead a primum mobile exists-- an attempt to
find a center of something, an inscape, which
can only be seen through the outer associative
words and patterns. Let me re-phrase this
if I hit someone with a brick and hurt them
at that moment individual consciousness is unaware
of the meaninglessness and yet is still somatically
driven to find content. The corporeal and mind
are "twinned" and each convehers for the same
result.

At the core of what you have termed "cathexis"
the same problem is found. While it is important
not to be bristled by the unreal pornography
that exists in Sondheim's work, (and  I am purposely
avoiding the report of Alan & Azure nakid because
only the text arrives here) when it comes
to redefining of pornography as words _rather
than_ words combined with an image, which
I see in his poems, then at some point to have
the word "rape" is to rape, and for a reader to imagine
raping is to rape as well. The word becomes the boundless--
shoots over the scenery, part to whole is needed
physical to mental, metynomy. synechoche

As for fake l-po, language itself takes place in the moment
never in the inventory of what it is to become. How these two
are current terms is apparent but considering they are not
_two way_ terms of each other, content is incomparable--
they are each in different time zones of meaning.


Be well

        What is the content of Chicken McNugget?



Two points: 1) Chicken McNuggets seem to express a desire that the structure
that
has been created, in a somewhat manic way, wants to be filled with chicken.
Is there a relation between that desire and the lack of chicken, for better
or worse, indicated by the word " McNuggets "--as a completely substitutable
word, but a substitution for what? A "buzzword" substituting for a
buzzword? What is the content of Chicken McNuggets? How are Chicken
McNuggets going to be
filled with chicken? This must be resolved.

What is the relevance of the numerical totality of  the words of text do
with anything?  I can only assume you mean this - the Language Project To
name it again)  - was of considerable significance: it was but that isnt
necessarily a function of its output or how much work was put into it.
   It is significant that a large number of writers (relatively: overall in
the "poetry pond" relatively small) were engaged in discussions on the
nature of language, new directions in poetry, new forms, the
political/cultural/social implications of language and various writers in
America and Europe and elsewhere who have influenced this movement. Do you
feel it is somehow being belittled? I know you say you are ok with
fakelangpo...but how do you _feel_ about it?

Maybe you're taking fakelangpo too seriously: but that it might be "A dream
of the great and the strange, inviting...?" That I feel would be
interesting: in fact it would be one avenue that Bernstein implies I think
when he talks of  a hyperspace with a multitude of voices and also the
possibilty of poetry being philosophy that is true to truth (ontological
truth rather than "factual") and we have now another space for open dialogue
whose form cant be predicted: like in fact a gigantic potential poem that
unlike Finnegan's wake is "unplanned" and open: an opening into dialogue.

> The redemption of the no longer signifying word would thus generate
endless
> content.
Why does the "no longer signifying word" need to be redeemed?  Do you mean
that the signifyer now takes "centre stage" and then content is beyond
normative "meaning"?  Not clear what you are saying here. A word that "no
longer signifies" cannot exist: in fact there is no such thing as a "non
signifying" anything ...though of course the way that texts are presented or
formed shows more or less referentiality: but there is no such thing as a
totally non-referential text: that would be a total vacuity! It would be
totally irrelevant: I'm not tlking about eg

              asd   out relat GOOOOD   plug'plug... $$
                           (((())))(((((  innnm

Because that DOES have signification:enormous. Of course its "significance"
relative to say a page from the New Yorker is greatly more problematic! But
its a question of degree.
   Endless content is a given, is it not: content is the whole deal
 Creeley is still basically right) .... I think though that there is a fear
here of the unknown: of what might be engendered: amost an Eliotic fear:
"After such knowledge, what forgiveness."   Redemtion: I think of "Redeem
the time."

I tend to agree with that: but reading the phonebook might be helpful to
some in such a session...but sure there would arise some what I would say
(tentatively) "out of context" or irrelevant (seemingly but whose to say
what is? irrelevant or even what is good or bad?) or at least inapproriate
texts: a parrallel would be an engineer presenting a comedy script as the
plans and calculations for a bridge project.  In that sense fake langpo is a
bit of a worry...

In the past the content has been integral to te whole project and or each
writer has his her own agenda: political, feminist, hstorical,
liguistic.....I can see i think where you are "coming from" on this.

I'm not poking fun at your statements just find that your "forming of a
question" is not clear: ok poetry can be unclear but its necessary to be
clearer in critical discussions. However, as you say, who can tell.

I think "fakelangpo" is ok but that Millie Niss etc have not studied
language poetry and its background in sufficient depth:  thus they risk
reinvinting various wheels...and misrepresenting some very significant and
often brilliant writing that is represented by eg those in "In the American
Tree" in which some great writers are represented.

I think one of the issues that emerges from these questions that much L-A
poetry has in common with psychoanalysis can be better clarified by
employing the distinction between manifest and latent in the psychoanalytic
approach to content, than by employing the concept of -cathexis of language=
-
which is interesting but, for me,  while its application in this context is
compelling from a literary point of view, it is, for me, psychoanalytically
off target. This distinction is best understood in the process of
psychoanalytic dream interpretation. A patient once reported to me a dream
in which the car she is driving crashes into a bank. She notices a piece of
the wooden counter falls off in the crash. Although this patient had yet no=
t
analyzed many dreams, she still quickly understood that the wood on the
counter referred to the phase -a chip off the old block- even before I had =
a
chance to say it aloud. Evidently we both thought of it at the same time.
The manifest content- a car crash. The latent content, a clich=E9, connected
with a thought which has great significance for her relationship to a
parent... Similarly, I feel, by extending the possibilties of free
association for the reader, by a variety of linguistic techniques, the L-A
writer, for example, Alan Sondheim in this discussion, allows the reader to
grasp not only the manifest content ascertainable in the words-and their
associated meanings- selected by the writer, but also the latent content in
the writer's mind, but, as in psychoanalysis, as a result of the free
association, permits this process to be a shared effort, as it is when an
analysis is moving forward. Also, in doing psychoanalysis in recent years, =
I
have the distinct sensation that no matter what happens on the manifest or
conscious level, much, much more is usually going on on a subliminal or
latent level, for a very long time, so that indeed, the patient and analyst
could, theoretically, discuss anything and the analysis will move forward;
however, when insight emerges, this is usually a harbinger of change on the
part of the patient, and to a lesser degree of significance perhaps, the
analyst as well.

Inkblots signify what?  Inkblots signify how?

in richard's reply here and elsewhere on the tortuous thread there are some
fascinating references to psychoanalysis as seen through popular and
academic eyes.  As these bits of content congeal on my screen I am put in
mind of a forgotten and generally poorly understood pioneer, Rorschach and
his inkblots [which now appear - illegally I think - on my TV in ads] that
may contain devils or angels but wonder of wondersdiagnosis of disorders of
thinking depends on the depending - it's not what you see inthe inkblot but
how you see it.

In other words, what's the "content" of an inkblot?  LangPo?

Barrett Watten asks several questions, parts of each of which eluded

<Third question: does Fakelangpo engage the textual production of
meaning in this sense, but as the empty site for textual "fun"?>

You know, because of the nature of so much of the poetry that I "enjoy"
reading (nature: its inclination to query its own foundational premises as well
as those of language and culture) already includes all or most of what I've
found "fakelangpo" to be getting at, I find it, at best, difficult to find
"fakelangpo" more "fun" than _My Life_, empty or more than empty.

Only maybe to add that I've never encountered a truly "empty site,"
excepting maybe Appendix Two of Susan Wheeler's _Source Codes_.

But we also have a question of context as well. Though what I want to say
about that, I'm not yet sure.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

WAY by Leslie Scalapino / Kenning #12 - the audio edition.

Kenning's 12th issue is a double-CD audio edition.  Disc one contains =
exclusive recordings of poetry and other sound-works by Charles =
Bernstein, Sawako Nakayasu, Akemi, Seacreature, Colossus & Guardian, =
Lauren Gudath & Jay Schwartz, Will Alexander, Anne-Marie Albiach, Murat =
Nemet-Nejat, Kristen Gallagher, Rodrigo Toscano, Andrew Levy & Gerry =
Hemingway, Bobbie West, Bruce Andrews, Eileen Myles, Amiri Baraka, =
Groundzero Telesonic Outfit International, Edwin Torres, Purkinge, and =
Nathaniel Mackey.  Disc one also features previously unavailable =
archival recordings by Allen Ginsberg (a strangely timely rendition of =
"HUM BOM") and Hannah Weiner (early St. Mark's Poetry Project =
performance of an unpublished section of the Clairvoyant Journal).  Disc =
two is a new studio recording of Leslie Scalapino reading the entirety =
of her book WAY.  This is the first and only audio publication of WAY, =
which is available in print from North Point / O Books.

Kenning #12 is available from Small Press Distribution and (hopefully) =
your local independent bookseller.  $15.00 / per.  You may also order =
directly from the editor if this is more convenient for you. =20

Subscribe to Kenning:  $25.00 / issues 11-13.  This is the only =
currently available subscription rate - but when you consider that you =
receive #11 (OFTEN: a play by Barbara Guest & Kevin Killian), #12 (the =
double CD audio edition), and the forthcoming "send-off" issue =
(featuring the column on "critical paranoia") - all for about $10.00 off =
the "cover price," it seems a shame to pass it up.  Subscribe by sending =
a check or money order in U.S. funds made out to the editor, Patrick F. =
Durgin, 383 Summer Street - LWR, Buffalo NY 14213, USA.  Overseas =
customers may wish to purchase Kenning online via SPD =
(www.spdbooks.org).
=20
Also note:  Kenning #10, a newsletter with new writing by Amiri Baraka, =
Nick Piombino, Camille Roy, Jen Hofer, Jean Donnelly, Anne Tardos and =
many others, is still available from SPD - only $6.00.  K. Silem =
Mohammad's chapbook HOVERCRAFT (Kenning #8) is also available from SPD =
for the same price.  It might be worth asking your local independent =
bookseller to stock Kenning editions.

thanks to everyone who replied in helping find Kerouac video footage
for my friends over at C-SPAN, who this weekend will be running a
show on him and his cohort, those who are or who have been "beat" --
check your local cable television listings. For those in countries
outside of the USA, you might check the internet, since I believe
much of the CSPAN broadcasts, including the above "American Authors"
series and also BOOKTV, are webcast.  I know I've tuned in to see
more than my share of floor fights over the problems with air bags
and the need for government funded automatic beer openers.

in any case, it seems apropos that on the day we are handed a new
government (they say this new government will need months to be
approved by the current government) we should be excitedly awaiting
another government sponsored broadcast of beatnik literature and
culture. Why the insistence on what will be surely equated as a
"decadent individualism" (fight for your right to drink, smoke, and
shout profanities). I realize I'm stoking the coals as the beachfire
has long expired, but isn't it perhaps a completely contentless
literature -- as in about "nothing" (though of course individual
pieces, like the lens of consciousness, are always about something)

...burrp...
ahem.

onto something else:


I stumbled on the alamo-girl site (while doing a search on the word
"ballywick" -- does anyone know the origin of that word? I realize I
have many questions) -- and I had never seen it before, or heard of
it or anything like it. I realize that nom de guerre karen eliot is
alive and kicking, and that she has become simply a cipher, a
particular index in this digital frontier. but this seems
particularly focused to me. the project is titled

"DOWNSIDE LEGACY AT TWO DEGREES OF PRESIDENT CLINTON
INTRODUCTION AND TABLE OF CONTENTS"

Does anyone know of anything like this happening on the so-called
"left" -- and by "left" I am referring to anyone interested in
keeping an eye trained on the current administration -- as the below
link does for clinton admin...  and I'm not so much interested in the
pseudonymous part of it but rather like Karen Eliot is a singular
identity shared by a collective, and what amounts to a citational
encyclopaedism.   check it out:

http://www.alamo-girl.com/

I'm curious because it's such a substantial effort and I'm wondering
if anyone is aware of anything like this (it was once my hope that
the indymedia.org site would facilitate this kind of archiving)... it
would have to function providing a "clearinghouse" information about
the activities of certain government agents and agencies -- providing
"search terms" for "bots" and "seekers" as well as good ole
informaton for a future that already seems forgotten.

finally, and i'll go back under my rock now, but with the talk of
perec and bok's books, and promises of other books as yet to be
published -- please forgive me for asking,  it's been so long, but
why are these compositional strategies "good" when they appear in
certain products like "books" (mean I works of art?) -- why do we
like them?  someone asked me recently what made it "good" -- and I
drew a blank.  please help!  thanks...

cheers, it's 65 degrees here

The procedural language contains its tropology of desire, more or less
open; the work (as in Mez's work) can be read on several levels, depending
on one's relationship to technology, computation, and the like.

The typing is a form of hysterical speech; the "appear nude," for those
who weren't there, is within a number of videos - not live. These are
associative blocks; they can be foregrounded or backgrounded, with or
without sound. The typing on the other hand, is literally the handedness
of the piece; the breakdown is more a slippage, the result of shape-riding
thought for example. I wanted to indicate the relationships among
protocols, languages, and intentions - the latter evidenced as 'leaky,'
parasitic, and generative. This is the area for example that one might
program in Perl, finding it necessary to return again and again to the
program, a continuous shaping.

Yes to the second 'in a sense' and only in a sense to the first. Not that
p.a. is either meaningless or random, but instead a p.a. related to
addiction in the same sense that gambling, sexuality, internet (for
examples) can all relate to a loose group of equivalent underlying
mechanisms. The question I'd ask, and constantly ask - Where is the body
in the midst of all of this; and further - given that knowledge, say, of
the world can consist of equations of increasingly fine tolerance (I am
generalizing greatly); and given that one has a certain phenomenological
horizon, consciousness, etc. - what is the relationship between this
knowledge and that consciousness? In other words, what constitutes
knowing? So my work has transparencies (nudity, exhibitionism, desire,
child-like language) and impediments/contusions - codework, chaos,
interruption, the 'binding' of language/body and for that matter the
'binding' of symbols themselves.

I'm not sure how to interpret the last phrase, whether the 'that'
references human or machine, but perhaps that is the point. But here we do
have the Eliza model (and a model I altered from the Doctor/Eliza program
in Emacs) - and it seems to me it would depend, as in any other communi-
cation, on the nature and content of that production.

That said, the therapeutic session can consist of nothing more than the
chanting of Om Mani Padme Hum - I see a therapeutic session as a working-
through of symptoms and causes, not a specific language production.

Fakelangpo - What would be fake realism in painting, fake cubism, etc. I
understand the idea of satire, but the 'fake' implies something else - for
one thing the authenticity of 'real langpo' - and at least for me,
Adorno's taken that notion (_The Jargon of Authenticity_) apart. Are
Berrigan's Sonnets 'fake' sonnets? Certainly, they're textual fun!

For me, and this isn't what you're asking, a 'content' is paramount; I
literally write as if each text is my last, as if there is a kind of
linguistic economy present (so many words, so little time), as if I owe
something to the reader, a kind of pleasure, philosophy, dis/comfort, or
the caress of hir desire -

dear Tony, I would love to see your story using only he vowel A, if you are
so minded to send. the idea of writing such a thing makes my mind creak, but
I would like to see what happens when one bears up to the creaking. thanks

Subject:      Content analysis
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Before responding to specific posts, I'll try to focus in on this "question
of content" in a few senses that intersect, and may or may not have to do
with each other.

First, a term that has emerged with the net economy is "content provider."
We could formulate a definitional sentence of a "content provider" that
would specify the vehicle for the delivery of content (an archive,
database, map service, image bank, search engine, etc.). For example, we
had the "Contentville" start-up that wanted to sell the product "content":
"We've got content: books, dissertations, batting averages, traffic laws in
82 countries, etc." This notion of content as a kind of information that is
assembled and delivered on demand to a client I think is one that has only
arise with this economy. (I note with pleasure that "Contentville," given
that it was selling some of my content without permission, seems now to
have gone under!)

Certainly Creeley's "form is never more than an extension of content" could
not have imagined it; we are in a different episteme. The relation between
the early postmodern prescience of the current episteme and the result--how
we got from one to the other--must wait for another discussion. But
Creeley's dictum or "law" as Olson put it, had radical implications that
went far beyond mere mimesis as the basis of form (the line as being "like"
breathing, etc.) For one thing, what if "content" is temporal--what then
can be said of form? Form no longer seems like a container for the thing
contained, and more like the "patterned energies" of temporal experience.

Now "Fakelangpo" proposes itself as a content provider--of Fakelangpo,
which is, so far, pretty scarce but maybe recognizable. It depends very
much on Millie Niss's search engines how much of it she can make available
at the site. This is somewhat like what an editor does in assembling the
content of anthology (for instance, Ron Silliman in editing the Tree), and
somewhat different. Millie Niss could, for instance, become involved with
the Apostrophe project and create a web crawler that would go out and get
some of that content--grab a bunch of Fakelangpo off the net. And convince
us that this is what Fakelangpo is. Or she could construct networks of
content providers who would bring their versions of it to the site. I
think, in fact, that just the idea of an empty content provider is a great
success, and that Fakelangpo may well enter the annals of
digital/conceptual art for that reason. Let's see what develops there.

This "going out and getting content" seems very much like what Alan
Sondheim has been doing, though I am not all that sure how. I imagine a new
day's content to be generated by a new day's procedure, which may be simply
typewriting or which could be quite technically complex. What are the
sources of this content? How does he determine his lexicon? Text/data
bases? How do his algorithms specify the scope of his content? It's not, of
course, required to know these things.

Rather, we have lengthy strings of symbols generated by some combination of
procedure and intention. This is aesthetic territory that has been worked
by others, from Mac Low to Berrigan. Berrigan, cited by Sondheim, is an
interesting case of "content provider," given that the Sonnets have a kind
of algorithmic structure and capacity to generate more content. One
question to ask with the Sonnets is how far can they go? There seemed to be
a kind of emotional logic by which the Sonnets became Berrigan's lived
experience, which was then reprocessed as more sonnets. In a way that is
the opposite of an "automatic poetry generator" (Katherine Parrish's
phrase), the Sonnets became more cathected, slowed down, became more
meditative. Of course, the language in the Sonnets always is highly
cathected; it's amazing that Creeley reported, in an interview, that his
experience of them at the Berkeley Poetry Conference was as neutral language!

So two kinds of content are involved here, relative "surface" and "depth."
What is the relation between the two? That's where the porn lexicon in
Sondheim is interesting. Also the use of error messages or failed
procedures. And where the "psychoanalytic dialogue," which is really just
the transference, comes in. In Lacan, we have a distinct move away from the
latent/manifest model in the dream interpretation Nick Piombino cites,
toward thinking about the "speech chain" itself as the conveyor of desire
in its very displacement. This stems from early thinking about the
linguistics of the "shifter" (where the "you" could shift its reference,
and generally does) to what Lacan called the "sliding of the signifier" and
finally "le blablabla." Hence the question of whether reading the phone
book would do as well. Nick's sense that talking about anything keeps the
process going addresses this--of course, associations are multiple and
continuous.

Then he mentions a key term: "insight." Here is a kind of content, all
right, that is very difficult to resolve with masses of text. The
experience of knowing through these textual procedures--which I am sure
takes place--seems very unlike the experience of an insight. It's more like
adjusting perspective, taking into account, and perhaps, finally,
identifying the material that one is experiencing with experience itself.
This seems an aesthetic/practical goal of Sondheim's deluging language,
with its opacities and associations--a literalizing of experience. Of
course, the technical detail is what connects precisely these experiences
with that result.

To comment on one specific response by Millie Niss, I do not think it is
necessary to read through the history of Language School theory to engage
the work. In fact, a lot of the older theory, by this time, is about as
relevant as a Soviet-era satellite, just waiting to crash into the Pacific.
That having been said, how does one "get" the content of that historical
development? Or of earlier collective forms of literature--surrealism, for
instance. How to deliver surrealism as content?

Of course, the detail that by 1985, a million words of Language Poetry had
been written is nothing but an absurdist moment in this discussion. But it
is relevant that now, one can manipulate that amount of content fairly
easily, while then it was a matter of time-consuming work. In "My Poetry,"
David Bromige, for instance, had to go out and assemble the references to
his work by hand, but now all it would take would be a simple Google search.

Chicken McNuggets is an important site for exploring the form/content
divide. One reason to be alarmed by the term "langpo" is its proximity to
that relation.

I return to the question of content. Barrett

Re: Tom Bell - I agree; it's not porn, illness, but a kind of necessity.

We are used to being used to language, language taken out from under us,
the political ideologies inherent in languaging. NN and others stop the
flow; I attempt to. What appears through the rupture of language - re:
Kristeva on Mallarme/Lautreamont in Revolution in Poetic Language. The

the usual poetics... When my mother died, the computer/codework came to my

Re David Baratier: You say " then at some point to have
the word "rape" is to rape, and for a reader to imagine
raping is to rape as well. The word becomes the boundless--" -
obviously I disagree. By this account, we cannot look at rape, analyze
rape, but must reduce it to the submergence of etiquette. The word is
overdetermined, but in none of my work to I assume the word in this
context. And by your own admission, then have you raped my text, raped me,
or raped your readers? One must take violence at its worst into account,
stare at the horrors, constantly, in order to avoid further; the same in
reverse goes for pleasure. And no - the reference to nudity or organs,
whatever, in print (or I daresay in visual/audio representation) does not
necessarily imply porn.

 Barrett, I realise several questions are set in motion in your reponses to
Millie's site. An absence of content in language writing is one of her
worries, and we have her question of what is to be put on her site. There
are perhaps analogue equivalents to content providers which do/did  the job
for some language writing. At its most elementary BART was such a provider/
search engine for Silliman, Andrews slips of paper, various
protocols which situate or aim a procedure now look like primitive
information systems. How much, if at all does that change the way we read
such writing?

 >>>"Positive content": which brings me to the question of interest here:
if "fakelangpo" were filled with content, in the sense that "content" is
what a "content provider" provides) what would it be? A dream of the

space?The redemption of the no longer signifying word would thus generate
endless content.

Due to an error on my part, a draft version of my review of Andrea Brady's A
Vacation of a Lifetime appears in the new Poetry Project Newsletter, rather
than a corrected version.

There's one error in that version that I want to correct right away, which
is re: depleted uranium.  As terrible a weapon as DU is, it doesn't work via
a "small nuclear reaction," as the review states.  (If such a thing were
even possible, the military isn't talking about it.)  DU is usually
described as working, in ordinance, by virtue of its being extremely dense;
fired at high velocity, it cuts through armor, after which a "conventional"
explosion occurs.  See Brady's poem "Ash Wednesday Seasonal Oi/ Depleted
Uranium, and tomorrow no Sunday" for an account of the horrific
after-effects.

Sorry for taking up bandwidth with this, but it seemed important to get it
right.  Check out the book, <http://www.saltpublishing.com>.

I agree. The example of David Bromige's "My Poetry" came up, which could
now be accomplished with the aid of a search engine and with a lot more
hits. But that doesn't entirely explain the pathos of the work--that
Bromige, following Pound's "I Gather the Limbs of Osiris," certainly, was
putting back the pieces of his poetry through the responses of others. The
"text" that resulted was, I think, an ironic displacement the
"sender/receiver" model of communication.

to my Textbook of Thinking, which among other things is an aesthetics of
the obscene; the reply was that such puncturing is merely cultural - unable to
reach, say, deeper into the chora. But I think not; I think there
is a place which is cited/sited/sighted and uncited simultaneously - a
place erasing place, substituting drives - one might say even erasing intention
in consciousness in light of / lieu of the greatest consciousness - and
that place is related to or at least relevant to porn and this puncturing.
Further, the puncturing for me is necessary; it shifts content from com-
fort to dis/comfort, an intenser readering, just as the lurid attracts and
holds etiquette in abeyance --

Of course the status of this "place erasing place, substituting drives" is
overwhelmingly interesting when it comes to "content." "Protocols" are
devised to help us reach that placeless place. Here, we would not want to
assume "content" as equivalent to abstraction, in the aesthetic sense. One
of the reasons for Sondheim's "impurity" (see the essay by Diana Greco on
that) would then be not to confuse that which resists representation as the
place of "substituting drives" with merely aesthetic ends. This is why
"language poetry" is never merely a style, and consequently why "langpo"
can never merely be a placeholder.

The question of pornography as content isn't merely the question of
eroticism. It also concerns this location of drives within the form of
communication. Here, the veritable figure of the machine comes in. The
locus classicus here is James Brown's "Sex Machine," the godfather of all
techno (and very early source of my later interest in that genre). The
one-chord repetition, irritating as it is, hooks up to the drives without a
doubt. In Sondheim, the status of "machinic" procedures seems
crucial--these effects are clearly "generated." How does machinic
generation of language effects (automatic poetry generation, as with KP)
locate the mobility of drives? I think we are getting close to something here.

Something or someone to react with or against is, for me, the "engine room of
poetry."  So, in that sense, a workshop is potentially an engine room.

I had thought of writing a larger response to this thread, but now for
various reasons that isn't going to happen.  However there is one facet of
what's being discussed I would still like to address--

I find the notion of the "fake" appealing or intriguing.  This partly stems,
for me, from Welles' _F for Fake_-- that sense of the blurring of the lines
between the fake & the authentic, that the one could suddenly be shown to be
the other (or contain aspects of the other) at a moment's turn.  I would
love to be able to write a "fake" work: a work which undermines its own
authenticity or interrogates the question of authenticity as a positive
aesthetic or political (moral) value.  Are Berrigan's Sonnets fake?  Maybe,
in the sense that they appropriate language, don't strictly follow the form,
etc.  On the other hand, Berrigan seems genuinely concerned with writing
something that engages, however perversely, in the sonnet tradition.  This
~authentic~ concern seems to mitigate against the question of his sonnets'
fakeness.

For me, the great example of a "fake" work is Spicer's _After Lorca_, which,
among other things, poses the question at what point do "fake" translations
become "authentic" original poems.  Also, at what point does appropriation
become appropriation.  Spicer is not stealing from Lorca's Spanish-language
poems, but translating (or at most, cribbing from existing translations) in
order to make his own poems.  At what point do notions of originality,
authenticity or authorship come into play?

The notion of "textual fun" is an interesting one-- one which I imagine
could have slightly different connotations for Barrett Watten, Alan Sondheim
(both quoted above), Millie Niss, myself, or many others on this list.  In a
list community which values the drive toward innovation within a broader set
of social, political & cultural imperatives, this notion of (admitting to
having) fun may pose a negative, "individualist" or anti-social value to
some.  Certainly from the standpoint of an articulated poetics one needs to
go further than saying merely, "it's fun"; yet can we avoid facile remarks
without evacuating the concepts of fun or pleasure from our thinking in
poetics or our practice as poets?  Can a "pleasurable" poetry also serve,
for example, to critique existing social or political orders?  Millie Niss,
in (deliberately?) playing the naif may in fact have posed a potent
challenge to the serious (male) intellectuals on this list.  What about it,
boys.  Anyone up for some Textual Fun?

sentence=content provider if language is a net economy.  it allows for the
toal(ized) meaning.  the sentence, and smaller units, is a base example for
archives, etc with respect for providing content.  words and letters are the
first instance of content if content is considered to be a data
representation of some kind.  sort of like pixels.  form is never more than
an extension of content simply because language is the content provider
where content is a representation based on apparent data.  this is where
someone like ponge, as in Soap, is critical for exposing the air inside the
tiny bubbles of form.  content is steeped in a debt to consumerism.  what
can i get from this?  if nothing, then it has failed.  language has
developed to insulate this relationship.  get to the point...  words take
time.  time is money.  brevity and efficiency are second only to ___liness.
language is driven to mean, and meaning is achieved thorugh content, so
content is the net result of its provider, its form and if it being related
through words this form is often the sentence.  this is all probably very
obvious and banal.

I WAS being deliberately naive and potentially offensive when I chose the
word "fun" to describe fakelangpo.  Had I said "gives aesthetic pleasure" or
something like that, it would not have seemed such a strange things to say:
one reads Language Poetry (or any poetry, but I was focusing on Language
Poetry because 1.  I do think it's fun to read and 2. it has a reputation
for being difficult, academic, and unfun on its surface, requirring much
study to appreciate) because it gives aesthetic pleasure.  Ok.  Nothing
controversial there.  But by choosing a word like "fun" I was chnaging the
tonal register into something immediate, informal, and naive.  People
probably think you read Ogden Nash because it's fun-- not Bruce Andrews.

However Language Poetry is frequently very amusing simply on its face, if
one reads it "for fun" without trying to extract meaning or interpretation.
Moreover, it doesn't have a meaning to extract in the sense of a theme or
message or idea (other than the ideas of Language Poetry in general, such as
appreciating bits of language for their own sake and not for their
connections to other pieces of language aimed at making a whole poem with
one idea).  So reading it for fun is perhaps the correct stance-- as deep
analysis of the sort suitable for otherr genres of poetry which use
symbolism and metaphor throughout will likely prove fruitless or worse it
will reveal a meaning that is only there accidentally, because we are
meaning-seeking creatures and are pretty incapable of reading more than a
few pages of poetry and thinking deeply about them without constructing an
interpretation.  But if we sipply look at the phrases themselves, and let
ourselves be amused by them, that is, "have fun," we are reading for the
individual units of language.

As examples of amusing bits of langugae from Language poems, we have in
"Lack of Entrepreneurial Thrift", section 2, from Bruce Andrews' Ex Why Zee

        Marching Papers.  Why does salt increase tomato temperature?
        I take hermeneutics to the cleaner.
        Little wet nurse shoes rev up real estate.
        Elbow practices igniton.

or, for example in Bernstein's _With Strings_

                O! the beauteous
        schmmutzing of the burnished begonias,
        showboating to no cheese in particular, a charade
        (parade) of inter-intentionality

Now I am not for a moment saying you SHOULDN'T think about these poems and
produce interpretations eventually, but a casual reading permits one to
enjoy the language on its face which is after all one of the stated goals of
the Language Poetry movement.  How you interpret a Language poem is perhaps
best left to thse who are in the know critically...I have my guesses but I
don't know what the usual critical methods are for Language Poetry.  What
they are not, I assume, is the blind translation of images into symbols for
this and that, and then a reading of the symbols into some pat idea or
moral.  I have always thought this kind of criticims suitable only for high
school students, if that, whether it be done in a low tech way in loopy
handwriting or with all sorts of notation.

Subject: Re: [webartery] Question of content


I had thought of writing a larger response to this thread, but now for
various reasons that isn't going to happen.  However there is one facet of
what's being discussed I would still like to address--


> > Third question: does Fakelangpo engage the textual production of

> >
>Fakelangpo - What would be fake realism in painting, fake cubism, etc. I

>one thing the authenticity of 'real langpo' - and at least for me,
>Adorno's taken that notion (_The Jargon of Authenticity_) apart. Are
>Berrigan's Sonnets 'fake' sonnets? Certainly, they're textual fun!


I find the notion of the "fake" appealing or intriguing.  This partly stems,
for me, from Welles' _F for Fake_-- that sense of the blurring of the lines
between the fake & the authentic, that the one could suddenly be shown to be
the other (or contain aspects of the other) at a moment's turn.  I would
love to be able to write a "fake" work: a work which undermines its own
authenticity or interrogates the question of authenticity as a positive
aesthetic or political (moral) value.  Are Berrigan's Sonnets fake?  Maybe,
in the sense that they appropriate language, don't strictly follow the form,
etc.  On the other hand, Berrigan seems genuinely concerned with writing
something that engages, however perversely, in the sonnet tradition.  This
~authentic~ concern seems to mitigate against the question of his sonnets'
fakeness.

For me, the great example of a "fake" work is Spicer's _After Lorca_, which,
among other things, poses the question at what point do "fake" translations
become "authentic" original poems.  Also, at what point does appropriation
become appropriation.  Spicer is not stealing from Lorca's Spanish-language
poems, but translating (or at most, cribbing from existing translations) in
order to make his own poems.  At what point do notions of originality,
authenticity or authorship come into play?

The notion of "textual fun" is an interesting one-- one which I imagine
could have slightly different connotations for Barrett Watten, Alan Sondheim
(both quoted above), Millie Niss, myself, or many others on this list.  In a
list community which values the drive toward innovation within a broader set
of social, political & cultural imperatives, this notion of (admitting to
having) fun may pose a negative, "individualist" or anti-social value to
some.  Certainly from the standpoint of an articulated poetics one needs to
go further than saying merely, "it's fun"; yet can we avoid facile remarks
without evacuating the concepts of fun or pleasure from our thinking in
poetics or our practice as poets?  Can a "pleasurable" poetry also serve,
for example, to critique existing social or political orders?  Millie Niss,
in (deliberately?) playing the naif may in fact have posed a potent
challenge to the serious (male) intellectuals on this list.  What about it,
boys.  Anyone up for some Textual Fun?

Listmates, as a codicil to Barrett Watten's note, I would like to see
FakeLangpo replaced --it is an awkward, ungainly 3-syllable term. I suggest
Flangpo' as superior to 'Klangpo' because the latter term is just too harsh.
Best, David

Dear Millie,
            you write very well.Do you by chance know of the Ouilipo
group? They're a french outfit who deal with writing constraints,
it's a kind of Language poetry technique but more detailed and more
mathematical. I myself have written many works that feature such things
as Lipograms,palindromes,anagrams and univocalics. eg. I'm working
on an idea called 'Anagram City' which has street names like
'Verdi Drive' and 'Eva Ave' in these streets are shops with names like
'Cafe Face'  'Schubert Butchers' and 'Craigs Cigars' All are anagrams
and also people in the story like 'Romeo Moore', 'Peter Trepe' .As
far as I know this idea is original and also has potential to be put
into a computer game. So, millie do you do anagrams at all?

        Dear dcmb,

        I already amended a codicil replacing the word fakelangpo with chicken
mcnuggets. Maybe you didn't read it. But I take great offense to your
suggestion to rename a site based upon your ideas of ungainliness. If you
don't like the site, term or what not, don't go to the site. Go back to
mother Russia you commie pinko. You mean old idea suppressor. Millie has
created a really neat site coming from the URL spork world. Her titles
should be applauded. Maybe you would like to see this changed to runcible
spoon too. But props to the Millie


                            Best, Geoffrey

Listmates, as a codicil to Barrett Watten's note, I would like to see
FakeLangpo replaced --it is an awkward, ungainly 3-syllable term. I suggest
Flangpo' as superior to 'Klangpo' because the latter term is just too harsh.
Best, David

Dear Everyone,

Does anyone know if Frank Samperi (b. 1933) is still alive; or, if he is
not still alive, the date of his passing? I thought he was still living
in Arizona, until I saw that permission to publish Samperi's poems in _The
ABC's of Robert Lax_ (1999) was granted to Claudia Samperi Warren . . . .
Now I am not so sure.

With many thanks for your help,

Aimee

As an alternative to Flangpo, I propose "Phalangepo" as a site for poetry
dealing only with authoritarian figures--Franco, Stalin, or the author of
your choice. That would recast the "fake" discussion into its proper
register: contestations of authorship as authority.

Because of the good response to our posting, we'd like to extend our offer
of 3 issues of NAW for $18 (rather than our usual subscription price of
$21) and any back issue (1-19) for $3 each.

The current issue, #20, due out in July, will feature poetry by
Rosmarie Waldrop, Martine Bellen, James Tate, John Olson, Ray Gonzalez,
Dara Wier, Karen Volkman, Clayton Eshleman, Nathaniel Tarn, Stephen
Ratcliffe, Elizabeth Robinson,  Beth Anderson, Craig Watson, Ray diPalma,
Brian Henry, and many others.  Special features: Oberiu, Russian Absurdism
of the 1930s and A Field Guide to Tymoteusz Karpowicz including an excerpt
from his long poem "Solving Spaces."  Karpowicz is the under-recognized
"language poet" of Poland now in his 80s. The issue emphasizing Eastern
European writing also features prose by Josip Novakovich and academy-award
winning director Milcho Manchevski ("Before the Rain").

Contents of back issues available from our website,
http://newamericanwriting.colum.edu


Many back issues of the legendary OINK! Magazine (1971-1985) are also
available, esp. #12-19.  Inquire if interested.

Tibetan "Chai"  I wonder if there's a connection, somehow with the (NZ)
Maori word "kai"  = food  and Samoan  'ai  (eg fia'ai = hungy)  kaimoana =
food of the sea or sea food.  The polynesians and other Pacific peoples came
originally from around South China about 40,000 years ago and made there way
across the Pacific...not from South America: much as I admire and am
interested in Thor Heyerdahl...apparently linguists have found links even
with Indo European words.?   Else, have a good time, Richard.

Steven.  Great poem...but I have  a strange habit of transposing words and I
"read"  ...'remarkably fuckable'  !   Which is a worry: is this fetishism a

On the subject of constraints in writing:

It was our own Aaron Belz who introduced me to the constraint "Mad Ape
Den," in which you communicate entirely in words of three letters or
fewer. Since then, my brain filter has been so corrupted that I can
write to him only in Mad Ape Den. A typical missive might read:

Hey AB! How you? All is hip, rad? I saw my eye doc; sez he, all is OK. I
dig the new bio pic you got. A bit of sun, a fun pic. Yrs, G.

One does have to resort rather a bit to abbreviation and slang -- had
Mr. Belz sent me a particularly excellent web link, I might well
respond, "You da man!" But it really forces you to think, and I like that.

Yours for BDSM of the mind,

Gwyn

Where I find workshops useful is that they socialise the solitary practices
of writing, it's not so much anything I learn from them, though maybe I do
so indirectly, but the 'putting out there' of them I enjoy.

Barrett Watten asks several questions, parts of each of which eluded
me, but this one really is sticking in my mind:

<Third question: does Fakelangpo engage the textual production of
meaning in this sense, but as the empty site for textual "fun"?>

You know, because of the nature of so much of the poetry that I
"enjoy" reading (nature: its inclination to query its own foundational
premises as well as those of language and culture) already includes
all or most of what I've found "fakelangpo" to be getting at, I find
it, at best, difficult to find "fakelangpo" more "fun" than _My Life_,
empty or more than empty.

Only maybe to add that I've never encountered a truly "empty site,"
excepting maybe Appendix Two of Susan Wheeler's _Source Codes_.

But we also have a question of context as well. Though what I want to
say about that, I'm not yet sure.

I just went to this site <www.slope.org> and had a great time. So here
I am wanting everybody to know about it . . . !

The best part of the site I found was that, along with samples from
the quite good book they're publishing, they included samples from ALL
THE FINALISTS! This is a wonderful thing, really. I can't give them
enough praise for what they've done here (and I'd like to add that the
Martha Ronk material here is (s)imply wonderful--she's one of our best
poets [and if you haven't read her book _eyetrouble_ you really need
to!]).

And like they say: "And MORE!"

best,
   JGallaher

Handwritten issues go on all the time in the 'zine world. I can think of
"Spunk" out of Hayward California off-hand but am sure that I saw at least a
dozen or so the last time I visited my local bookstore. Maybe it's time it
goes more mainstream?

jesse,

jw curry and his curvd h&z press did some of these in toronto, early '80s.
editions of 50 or so, each page hand-done by contributing poet.  i remember
going thru multiple copies and suddenly realizing how consistent john m.
bennett's "shakey" handscript was... nothing random about it.

john also did multiple copies of publications, each one handtyped... direct
reference to the russian samzidat practice of publication via carbon copies.
more than a tonic--something to keep in mind, if any need a distribution
system for truly subversive worx (now that th gov't has unleashed
Carnivore).

Frank Samperi
is dead, as of 1987 but I might be off on that date.
Claudia is his daughter.
John Martone has edited a selected Samperi titled
"spiritual necessity".... should be out sometime this year.

of course if it has not been mentioned, in canada we had oversion eternally
spinning which was a messy magazine with pastiched pages full of
photocopying license and grainy highlighted randomness.  each issue was a
brilliant collage art piece including writing by a fairly diverse range of
writers.  a typical page featured photocopied images and handwriting,
sometimes yellow highlighter.  the editor, john barlow would scribble and
add to each issue post print.

Dear Jesse,

Two thoughts on this thread:

as a bookdealer, I've come across a number of instances of "carbon copy"
magazines (i.e., each copy of the issue is made as a direct carbon),
including two (titled "N" and "Pilz") for both of which, I think, George
Stanley was responsible. I'm sure other dealers could make reference to
additional examples.

among what must be many great precedents, Lewis Carroll edited, wrote,
and wrote out by hand copies of eight magazines for the amusement of his
family "during his adolescence." One of those, The Rectory Magazine, was
published in facsimile by the University of Texas Press in 1975 (the
original ms. is in the Humanities Research Center collection). It's a
hoot.

I am going to be out of town from Sunday July 7th through Monday July

I am hoping to collect $250  for this two weeks, but it is
negotiable--

please let me know if you know of anyone who might be interested in doing
this.   Please distribute this to cat lovers in need of a brooklyn vacation!

Martin Spinelli asked me to pass this on to the list --

Resonance FM in London (104.4 FM) has just started rebroadcasting the
LINEbreak series of poetry readings/interviews on Friday evenings at 10:30.
(The series remains available at the EPC in RealAudio.)

Checking this out, Resonance FM sounds like a great new radio project. A
sound poetry show follows LINEbreak. Web info at

Thanks, Jerrold, for the kind mention. I think the original question was
about people using handwriting itself as a method of reproduction --all
I'll ever done is write it down once & xerox it, which is a little less
heroic. I stick by what I've said earlier, about handwriting as the textual
equivalent of the hand-held camera: it's not to everyone's taste, but for
those tuned into it, its expressive range can be much wider than that of
type. It amazes me how many writers who seem clued into the inseparability
of form and content ignore the leveling effect of reproduction in type on
their own work. That might sound unkind, but prove me wrong: I'd love to
hear how poets who publish exclusively in type conceive of their choice of
graphic medium.

Type has its virtues, of course, easy reproducibility and transmission to
name a couple. Nor is "leveling" an entirely undesirable effect: who can
deny the thrill of being published in a magazine that comes from seeing
one's poem appear in the same font as the other poets', when one or two of
them are famous? "Hey, that's my poem! Right alongside Ray di Palma's!"
That kind of thing. At some level, publishing in one's own handwriting
might amount to a rejection of community --or, alternately, a baby step
toward a new one. Who knows.

What I want to know more about is John Bennett, like where and how does he
live and work?  I never get tired of looking in his _rOlling COMBers_. Does
he ever show his work, like in galleries? Does he surf? Anyone LRSN

What I was thinking of, David, were the linotyped(?) pages of the SJMOS...or
your roll of paper towels, etc... All of which, for me, anyway, resemble the
immediacy (if that's not the proper phrasing, then I'm thinking of the
physicality that handwriting (even the reproduction of) suggests...much like
Robert Grenier's work) of writing....

Then there is also Larry Eigner's typography, which, I think, is incredibly
suggestive of writing by hand.

Type is pretty much a necessity for me at this point. Tendon damage in my
writing hand makes it, for the most part, impossible to grip a pen for any
length of time.

Dearest Listees Barrett Alan Nick Chris Wystan Toni Millie Aaron and All.

Not sorry to barge in here but for "textual" do I read "sextual"?

 Here's a picture of fun: I just had quick look into the letters betwixt
Creeley and Olson and they are havin' a great time: of course its serious
fun and a lot of the quesytions by old Olsy dont get answered but they are
"talking to themselves" in a kind of way which is what artists do I think:
they "philosophise" continuously, moving from the idea (theory) to practice
and here the young Creeley tries to convince Olson re (I think it was Miles
Davis) and Olson talks a bout Hart Crane and then he talks about Gerald
Manley Hopkins: and Creeley mentions a book about magic I have in Paladin by
Seligmann ...they are either edging toward or they have dealt wih Projective
Verse (I'm missing vol 1 so dont know yet) [ anycase the letters are like a
huge poem] but thus anyway the process of theory to practice: of
"verbalising one's ideas: however framed, seems to be neccessary even for
musicians although some do it less obviously, but all of us are in some way
"thinking about or through" what we are doing or in some way synthesising
our experiences which eventually come out say as a Borgesian kind of
brilliance of writing or a kind that only the writer thinks is "brilliant'
or as Langpo or Fakelangpo or theoretical and rather gnomic utterances by
Barrett Watten etal and Toni Folari gets all the Oulippo cultists revvin'
about a possible "Avoid" ...all good stuff: some of us just read...but then
we gotta talk at some time we have to we have to we gotta get across town
man and see that mean that mean that green that black that mean machine I

that machine that mean ol' machine 'cause it does somethin' ....It DOESNT
matter what it does: maybe we just gotta keep getting in and out of that
different river like ol' Heraclitus ("...sage Heraclitus says...")
  But that's only one example of "fun" ... I'm not an accco but I was
"introduced" (more or less to Creeley and Olson via Alan Loney who also
"isnt" an academic but is 'n interesting poet but a bit prickly but 'es not
mean i mean man....and thinking out strategies and possibly interactions and
raisons d'etre and maybe being alive only and its tearin' a gale here and my
window frame makes a cross against the sudden sun and the blue's out a bit
there and I lie on me bed and think  of nothing and read a short thing by
Borges or look at  the light glinting side slip on an empty beer bottle or
turn some pages of Kristeva because Alan Sondheim mentioned her and then
wonder where my Intro to Lit Theory is by Eagleton so i can read somethin on
Psychoanalysis then i finisih reading Virgil (the Eclogues ) and think I
must get that book of stories by Guy Davenportcalled "Eclogues" and a poem
from my priest friend Leister Kyle comes from the South Island: its called
King of Bliss it starts:

            My Life

            Is in the sun,
            a white light glowing.
            I am always warm
            and have no need of  stimulants.

            The leaves in my garden are glossy green and dark,
            the paths of sand
            a distant sea breaks on a reef
            and sea birds glide.

And it coninues further down:

            I need no light:
            my intuition's like the sun-
            it searches tests and probes the mind
            as lovers do the flesh,
            as scholars do the word.
            The weak the watery strengthen in my sight
            lies oxidies.
            Truth turns my soul-
            a flower to the sun!
            Each bud unfurls
            each calyx grows
            and every part is fully fledged
            and free.

But as I look further in the book I see hat htere are maps and italics and
the text starts to break up and in a lot of parts he's using the style (or
layout and methodology) as in Lynn Heijinian's "The Cell" which I lent
Leicester.  Then he gets to:

             The Second Therapy

    Mrs Albury holds her mind.
    She aches behind my left eye,
    tenses at the back of my neck
    as I wonder at her need of my healing art.
    She brings migraine with her,
    self-doubt and troubled dreams.

    Such clients come occcassionally,
    to stimulate and disturb.
    From them theories spring and
    challenges to the pattern.

(by Leicester Kyle)

Who is mad: the psychiatrist becomes the pateint:  but Leicester handles his
words subtly, deceptively, lightly.  Cunning....I have troubled dreams. I
hate sleeping. What has this to do with anything? What are we. How  are you
Wystan?   How's everyone? I just had some corn from a can and an egg mixed
and toast and coffee so i;m redy for a vision or maybe a wank or music or
I'll go for a run or read some more of The Cantos (which I have to concede
i've never read right thru before).  Then I go into my room again and work
out how many years I would like to live: its at least 50 x 2000 = 100,000
weeks if I wanted to read that may books and then I realise its hopeless:
we'll never know anything or everything or will we? And do we know love? Its
getting dark here, I dont want to sound dramatic...but we're all alone.
(Let's not get too accurate).  I love the dark: but does it love me?

Richard Taylor  (Homo Thinkins)

between pound and cummings are incredible too. esp. as they play and move in
and around language.  meditative, quick, witty and philosophical.  with all
the right trimmings, typografic fun and getting under one another's skin.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

i think it is important to be a writer right now typing poems. levelling,
sure.  especially since computers have become dominant as a means of
allowing increased, though often frought, communication.  the choice to type
poems is the choice to innately speak about/against/around the effect of
this levelling by technology.  so form and content operate.  every poem that
appears typed is a historical account of the technology that produced it as
well as the thing itself.  typed poems will seem archaic to whatever means
of reproduction exist for poems in the future.  and those means will also
speak to the social and cultural climate that gave rise to their dominance,
their leveling.1  in this way the pen is no less of a levelling device.  it
enforced a technique toward standardized communication despite the seeming
variablity of hand.  there are always typefaces others have not used.  and a
whole history of exploring the possibilities of typefaces to
convey/affect/effect meaning, as a means to score a poem for recital for eg.
  i was enrolled in a handwriting correction class as a child for a number
of years and never got the hang of it, still haven't.  this standardization
is also a means of levelling, albeit for the purpose of legibility.  the pen
requires a number of nuances that differ from quill and ink just as typing
differs from handwriting.  to talk about the machine the voice must come as
if from the machine itself.

1.  we will continue to update outmoded reproductive methods and incorporate
past texts into the communication models for the future.  supply and demand.

John Bennett is the editor of Vagabond Press; last I heard he was in

John M. Bennett is the guy w/ the shakey handwriting, and author of rOlling

Bob. You should connect up with your fellow instrument inventor. I'm
interested in that stuff but more from a point of view of  how things
connect up I suppose eg I didnt know much about various contemporary
musicians (I had probably listened to a lot of them without knowing who they
were as we had some good stuff on te radio (Government station) here in NZ
even inthe 60s )  but more recently became interested in the background of
modern and contemproray music (I liked some of bartok and others post  and
pre him eg Varese and Xenakis etc) but unless i make a big effort to
concentrate a lot of it escapes me: (mind you I suppose its my mood and
because I'm reading lit a lot so dont want anything that 'clashes" with my
reading AS I'm reading) but I like the idea of Cage and so on and others:
and i believe that Ives preceeded him (in "detuning pianos etc) (and Ives
father)..I also enjoy the music for a toy piano. I believe its skat, but I
used to do a lot of improvisation and 'sound ' via my mouth like a
trumpet-sax and once i did (I used to make noises all the time for nervous
reasons) and one day I did a "jazz" solo al la my bouche and the people in
the restaurant I was in applauded (mind you I was pretty plastered), and at
aperformance thing i improvised a whole music performance poetry thing some
time back and this guy right into jazz thought I should join into my
daughters' band! But I actually  prefer the more "serious" stuff but I can
"cut it" if I'm tanked enough: its strange becuase i cant recall music in my
head...I can play the piano: and improvise endlessly (I used to in cassical
mode) but I did it before I got into writing: I think it was a kind of
displacement of my real abilities which are in visual art and poetry etc so
i was just "enacting" "automatically"...but my interest now is in the ideas
of musicians rather than their music as such: although that said there are
some things that really intrigue me: I'm not so (never have been) interested
in so-caled "popular" music (some I  do I suppose but my preference is
else)....an interesting composer over here is John Psakis and there's
another guy who ( I cant find who he is i wanted to record him again) but he
starts by interviewing himself and he gets faster and faster and then
everything goes 'crazy'... but I recored a lot of fascinating electronic
music: one of my daughters is excellent on the Hawaian Guitar (she's in
Melbourne in the Nudie Suits) and the other is piano and violin (classical
and jazz etc).  But I keep coming back to Bach. Just picked up on your music
making: it sounds like a fascinating thing you've got going there.
 Sometimes, dont you think, the sounds ofthe wind or distant sounds of birds
or trains or dogs or a big iindustrial hammer are fascinating or evn just
stop and listen to thecomputer? Strange:we often miss the "reality" of
what's naturally out tere or in there or whatever....Its a cliche but: the
sounds of silence...pehaps silence, if acheivabe is the most profound
sound....
   And the sounds of the body: I just remembered how my ex used when we were
young to listen literally to my heart: her ear on my chest: that memory cuts
me...sounds eh...sounds...

Ron,

The fact that Eigner never wrote by hand, for me anyway, makes his use of
type even the more fascinating. As is type, in itself, could be suggestive
of "handwriting's" physicality & immediacy. I always find his spatial
arrangements on the page incredibly wonderful...

Best,

Jerrold

I haven't been following this thread completely, so
apologies if I am re-stating--

A couple of summers ago, after reading Susan Howe's ED
essay in "Birth-mark" I realized she is right: one
can't experience Dickinson's poems in the typed
versions. The 'reading editions' cut out the alternate
wordings; even the typescript editions do not include
the Dickinson line-breaks; which upon examination (the
most obvious example I can think of is "I felt a
funeral in my brain") are critical to a reading of the
poem.--

so the only solution (not much of one) was to spend a
month or so with Franklin's variorum and the
manuscript books and literally teach myself how to
read ED's very difficult handwriting.

difficult but so worth it

here's the Johnson version:

I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
And Mourners to and fro
Kept treading--treading--till it seemed
That Sense was breaking through--

And when they all were seated,
A Service, like a Drum--
Kept beating--beating--till I thought
My Mind was going numb--

And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul
With those same Boots of Lead, again,
Then Space--began to toll,

As all the Heavens were a Bell,
And Being, but an Ear,
And I, and Silence, some strange Race
Wrecked, solitary, here--

And then a Plank in Reason, broke,
And I dropped down, and down--
And hit a World, at every plunge,
And Finished knowing--then--



here's with ED's line breaks: (from memory...I hope I
got it right)


I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
And Mourners to and fro
Kept treading--treading--till
it seemed
That Sense was breaking through--

And when they all were seated,
A Service, like a Drum--
Kept beating--beating--till
I thought
My Mind was going numb--

And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul
With those same Boots of Lead,
again,
Then Space--began to toll,

As all the Heavens were a Bell,
And Being, but an Ear,
And I, and Silence, some strange Race
Wrecked, solitary, here--

And then a Plank in Reason, broke,
And I dropped down,
and down--
And hit a World, at every plunge,
And Finished knowing--
then--

ah yes in North Arlington NJ, which is Half Holy Cross Cemetery, at the tiny
high school in 1964,  a wit Andrew Scholes and a couple of other seniors, who
says the out crowd can' t do something intelligent,   began "the Weekly Gas
Bag" ( would love to find a fellow NA'er to inquire if title was borrowed
from James Farrell) ,  it featured sarcasm, directed against the Dover boys ,
the gas bag' s name for the Joe college brown nosed group, those Honor
Society types who never were in detention, wish i had saved some, i believe
Tues. was the week date of issue and i can recall clamoring for my copy it
was in the fine tradition of mad magazine, teachers were also lobbed at a
select group of teacher's were known to read the gas bag in secret.

The closet thing I'm aware of is the Media Whores site:
http://www.mediawhoresonline.com/
though it achieves its criticism of Dubya in a circuitous way by going
after the journalists.

Subject:      Poet Laureate
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Attention:
This notice came from the Library of Parliament, Ottawa, Canada:
As you may be aware, Bill S-10 providing for a Parliamentary Poet Laureate
was passed by the Senate and the House of Commons and received Royal Assent
on December 21, 2001.  The terms of the new 75.1(1) of S.C.2001, c.36, added
to the "Parliament of Canada Act" stipulates that the poet may:
* write poetry, especially for use in Parliament on occasions of state;
* sponsor poetry readings
* give advice to the Parliamentary Librarian regarding the collection
  of the library and acquisitions to enrich its cultural holdings; and
* perform such other related duties as are requested by either Speaker
  or the Parliamentary Librarian.

This letter is to inform you that the Selection Committee has been
established and would be happy to consider the application of a qualified
candidate from your association/organization.  Please forward applications
before June 21, 2002 to the following address:
Mr. Richard Pare, Parliamentary Librarian
Library of Parliament
Room 668-S Centre Block,
Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0A9

Applications may also be sent to the following e-mail address:
parer@parl.gc.ca .  Any material supporting a candidate must be submitted in
text format.

To meet the criteria established as part of the selection process,
candidates must:
* have a substantial publication history (including poetry) displaying
  literacy excellence
* have made a contribution to the writing community
* be an accomplished writer who has influenced other writers
* have written work reflecting Canada
* be a Canadian resident.

As the Parliamentary poet Laureate may wish to play an active role in
publicly promoting poetry to Canadian citizens, a practical knowledge of
both official languages would be an asset.

Literary artists working in oral traditions are also eligible.  They must be
recognized as professionals by their peers (aritsts who work in the same
artistic tradition).

The Selection Committee will review all applications received from
parliamentarians, from various Canadian poets' and writers' associations and
directly from interested candidates.  The Selection Committee will submit a
short list of three candidates to the Speaker of the Senate and the Speaker
of the House of Commons who will then make the final selection and will
oficially announce the nomination of the first Parliamentary Poet Laureate.
In order to ensure representation of both official languages, the Speakers
will announce that the nomination of the Poet, in successive years, will
alternate between French and English authorship.

The Parlilamentary Poet Laureate will receive, on a yearly basis, $12,000 as
a stipend (taxable) and a maximum of $10,000 for reimbursement of domestic
travel and living expenses.

Should you require additional information about this process, please contact
Richard Pare (pronouced Pa-ray) or his Executive Assistant, Guylaine
Rondeau, at 613-992-3122.

I am reading his _Progress_   I did not make up the critical term "content,
but I assert that his poem posesses it.  (Web stes have content if there is
text on them, whether or not it's vacuous.  Presumably a poem only has
content if it has some themes running through it or narrative structures or
makes you see something or whatever...  anyway, like Justisce Sterweart
said, "I don't know what it is but I know it when I see it.")

I gather I was guily of causing the following process (in the langugage of
"Progress"

        questions,
                before I understand.
        Wraiths escape from a roof
        To be recast in concrete
        A clinical, moody, telepathy
                                (p.46)

I am too scared to try to anyalyze the poem bit by bit but it seems as if
several things are happening.:

0) there is a central argument about the act of writingg and its relation to
the object written about whcih runs through the poem
1) perfectly clear things are being said through slighlty altered,
disjointed language
2) apparently clear things are being said that don't mean what they say-- in
this poem everything is an example of something, (is this the same as a
metaphor for it?), so we don't think the narrator "really has" a snake and a
vase in stanza one:

        Relax,
         stand at attention, and.
        Purple snake stands out on
        Porcelain tiles.
        Is the thing.  Skewered by desaign...

        One way contradictory use
           is to specify empty

3) Sometimes there are fragments which I find more of in most other Language
Poetry which seem unconnected to the main thrust of the poem and apprear not
to mean at all:

                                   picture...

        of price tags held up by strings.
        to avoid bathos in England.
        Cast trumpet on scores.

however I am not sure that this image doesn't support the running argument
and certainly an argument could be made that it does.  There is somewhere
the suggestion of writing by collecting little yellow cards with pieces of
language on them and putting them together.  This seems constructed that
way, almost, yet I heitate to make guesses like that wuth Barrett hiding in
the wings.

with trepidation,

Millie

Here's my take on this year's Cork Festival--a month late, I'm afraid, but I
hope still of interest. [PS: yes, the tardy _Gig_ 11 is almost out.
Everything's set to go except the essay & a few reviews.  Hopefully it'll be
ready for printing within a week.] -- all best --N

---

The posters for the Cork Poetry Festival, held this year on May 10 and 11,
pronounced it the "6th Annual" event, which is a slight fudge that is meant
I think to be also a statement of determination: the 2001 event didn't
really happen (what counts as the "5th Cork Poetry Festival" was a small
poetry reading in Kinsale, since the main festival fell through that year),
and this year's event happened only through the determination of Trevor
Joyce and Matthew Geden.  That, despite very last-minute organization and
insecurities of funding, it was a notable and enjoyable event with a strong
programme of readers and speakers is thus little short of remarkable, and I
hope bodes well for future events.

The readings were booked into the Triskel Arts Centre.  Due to the Centre's
slip-up the main theatre was double-booked for the first night, so we were
shunted into a harsh white cubicle through whose walls pounding dance music
occasionally intruded; but on the main day, the 11th, the readings were held
in the originally booked space: a small but comfortable darkened theatre.
(One pleasing thing I noticed about the festival, incidentally, was that the
staff at Triskel seemed genuinely pleased to be holding the event, & were
quite curious about the proceedings.)

I won't give a full account--I can't as I didn't take notes & don't have a
good memory--but will try to at least touch on everything, & when I have
copies of some of the work read I'll insert a sample.

The opening night featured Patrick Galvin, an older, more established poet,
who read well from fairly conventional but well-written poems.  (Don't take
"conventional" as a shorthand term of criticism here: I do not believe in
using the term "innovative" to mean "good", "conventional" to mean "bad".) -
I was called upon on short notice to introduce the Welsh poet Ian Davidson:
in doing so I tried to place his work in the context of the distinctive
University of Essex poetry scene of the 1970s: with figures like Ted
Berrigan, Ed Dorn & Tom Raworth frequently present, it was the breeding
ground for writers like Douglas Oliver, Ralph Hawkins, Kelvin Corcoran, John
Muckle, Charlie Ingham and Ian Davidson--proof that accounts of the UK
modernist scene of the last few years would do well to get beyond cliches
about "Cambridge" and "London" schools.  Ian's work is pared-down, carefully
observed, often funny, and increasingly assured: he hasn't published much
(the only separate publication of his I have is the brief, Kelmanesque Human
to Begin With, an 8pp publication from Peter Riley's Poetical Histories),
but I've got a few things of his coming out in The Gig, several of which he
read at Cork: I'll paste in a couple:

ASHES IN THE MOUTH

water runs through
many branching veins

afraid to stand I continued
drinking and eating
look around
sing to yourself

like when the welder
catches the arc
the past
through gritted eyes


MODE FREE

down the wires like liquid
the bubbled infospeak of

too old to be free of keys
for the longest time of clay

the sound of cutlery the
. . . of crockery

to get back to the matter in hand
of which the subject I

two trees in a field it were
as air was but solid like

appearing to flow uphill
having taken to the streets


Trevor Joyce gave a characteristically demanding, brisk and intense reading,
the centrepiece of which was his first public performance of "Stillsman."
"Stillsman" (so far not yet published in separate form; bits can be found in
_Shearsman_ & the whole text is in an anthology edited by Bob Archambeau
whose title escapes me at the moment) is a prose poem set out on the page in
all-capitals, without punctuation, like an engraved memorial inscription;
like most of Joyce's prose work, it is a collage of disparate source
materials, though they are so interwoven and rewritten that the density and
integrity of the text is formidable.  It is relentless, disturbing work.
One source, Trevor remarked in his introductory comments, was a scientific
experiment to determine whether birdsong is innate or learned: young birds
were exposed to recordings of birdsong from which the pauses for breath had
been edited out.  The birds would lose consciousness in attempting to
imitate the songs without pausing to breathe.  Here's part one of the text,
which is in 12 (run-together) sections:

STILL THE HEART BEATS AS THE FIRST LIGHT BROACHES THE HORIZON HUNDREDS OF
BIRDS STRIKE UP THEIR TINY BODIES FILLING THE AIR WITH FF MELODIES CUT WITH
A SOLEMN OATH RECALL THE PATIENT ONE OSCAR C THOUGH A BED FULL OF BONES HAD

SUCH A CREATURE CAN DO TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AT ONCE WITH ITS THROAT EVEN

MISSES NOTHING AT ALL AND IT S OBVIOUS IN TALKING WITH HIM HOW THOSE LITTLE

WHISPER OF THE WIND IN THE CORNFIELD IS FOREVER AUDIBLE AS THE GRAIN WHICH

After a pause for dinner (mostly in liquid form) we returned for a second
session that evening.  It opened with a short paper by Alex Davis, which
discussed the crucial parting of the ways in early 20th century Irish
literary culture between nationalism and modernist writing, with Thomas
MacGreevy as the pivotal figure. - I didn't have much time for Michael
Begnal, a transplanted American poet living in Ireland who runs a magazine
called _The Burning Bush_: I don't have any of his poetry to hand & can't in
fact now remember a thing about it.... - Matthew Geden is from the UK, & is
(as he later said in conversation), in transition from a "mainstream" poetic
style which he feels he couldn't do much more in, to something drawing on
more experimental poetries.  I'll be curious to see where he goes, but didn'
t think the writing was there yet: still dependent on poeticisms and rather
wordy & lacking in intensity.  Oh well.  The best piece was a tribute to
Trevor Joyce which was basically a cento from his work.

Keith Tuma started off his reading with a mordant homage to Tom Leonard--a
text that began with voluble self-dismissal then flipped over into
tightlipped monosyllabic utterances, almost purely phatic.  Keith, cris
cheek and Bill Howe have been at work on a collaborative text since last
year: _Critical Path_, a travelogue through Bush's America that spits and
crackles with anxiety and anger.  Only Keith was present at Cork to perform
the text, but he gave a finely judged, suitably abrasive and manyvoiced
performance.  Here's one passage from one recent "version" of the text (it's
still very much in progress):

-----You know they've got these wired restaurants called Ground Rounds and I
had a friend in Maine who worked in one ATTA BOY  -  insert crackle or
cackle CROP DUSTER for extra authenticity  -  yeah he worked at the Ground
Round as a slowing-traffic-olive-garden-hollow-pike chef STUMPS. One of the
things he told me about was an idiot guy who worked with him on a shift that
he hated, he just hated it FEEDING WHILE FIRING but he was amusing once in a
while because he'd do something extraordinarily stupid like- - HOPE OF
STOMPING  - - invariably he'd get really high before going to work, not my
friend WHITE POWDER but this idiot guy, and one day he got really high like
he usually did going to work and he CHICKEN went errrrr he was going across
the kitchen tripped over errr his own feet HE SAID NUKES DAMN IT reached out
to you know catch OSAMA himself with his hand and put his hand right down
into the bottom of a THIS TEXT MELTED deep frier


Next day started at 10:30 with a trio of readings.  I've been on record in
my last account of the Cork Festival (in 1999) as expressing doubts about
Geoffrey Squires' poetry.  It's thus a pleasure to report that his reading
on this occasion was much the strongest I've heard him do (the other
occasion was New Hampshire in 1996): it was a very precise & compelling
account of two quite disparate texts--his early book _Drowned Stones_
(1975), which is a series of condensed, sometimes slightly twisted or
broken-off scenes or anecdotes; & a recent untitled sequence which has only
appeared so far partially in _Shearsman_ 50, which is much more meditative
and abstract in cast, constantly pausing to rephrase something just said or
propose an alternative train of thought.  Here's the opening section of the
1975 text & the 14th section of the new poem.

(And all the trouble to learn him, the
strangeness of another, his turnings)

it was good, it was as it should be, we lived
two miles from the town, quite isolated, no
car

didn't get the electric till 1953 and only got
it then because my mother had the sense to give
the engineer a cup of tea

well he said we might as well take it up the
hill when we're at it

Fergal Gaynor was a new name to me, a younger Irish poet, & of the younger
poets present this year he's the one I got most out of--not "experimental
writing" but well-turned short lyric, if I remember rightly (I have no texts
of his). Michael Smith read from a set of translations of Lorca--without
knowing the originals I can't of course judge them too knowledgably but they
certainly came across well in his reading.

After a lunchbreak we came back for a short talk by Keith Tuma. Originally
the idea was that he give a scaled-down version of a formal paper he'd
delivered a few days before in London at Birkbeck; in the event, Keith
decided to scrap the paper, instead informally discussing the book and
making some pointed remarks about Edna Longley's Bloodaxe anthology.  As he
noted, Longley's book privileged out of all proportion the short,
self-contained lyric, so by way of counterpoint he delivered readings of a
number of short poems from the Oxford book, some of them decidedly
nonlyrical (DH Lawrence's "Willy Wet-Leg").  He then had me make a few
off-the-cuff remarks about my own role in the book as annotator. - Randolph
Healy read the entirety of _Arbor Vitae_, which is for me one of the great
poems of the 1990s, a passionate response to the history of the repression
of sign language in Ireland which, true to its title, branches out to tackle
many different issues: perhaps the ultimate theme is really human hubris and
the limitations of human knowledge and agency.  It was a pleasure to hear
Randolph read the whole text (usually he just performs part 1), but it was
not the strongest version I'd heard him deliver: that would be the
memorable, visibly taxing reading of part 1 I witnessed at the 2000 CCCP.
(The whole text is available on Trevor Joyce's Sound Eye website:
http://indigo.ie/~tjac/Poets/Randolph_Healy/Arbor_Vitae/arbor_vitae.htm)  It
's a pity Randolph didn't also read some more recent work, as I've been
quite taken by his recent short poems. (He did give a sample on the previous
night, as Trevor asked him & Raworth to give short "preview" readings on
that occasion to round off the evening.)

Maggie O'Sullivan has family roots in Ireland, in Skibbereen, which is
material drawn on in texts like That Bread Should Be (the reference is to
the Irish Potato Famine: the phrase quoted is "That bread should be so dear
and life so cheap"). She gave a typically forceful yet nuanced reading from
a variety of texts-if memory serves at this late date, I think it was
"Winter Ceremony" and/or "Waterfalls", "Ellen's Lament", & (the last text
performed) Red Shifts, her new book from etruscan books.  I won't quote any
of the work here because it does present a considerable obstacle to
reproduction in plaintext email: it often uses the page as a visual prosodic
field, with eruptions of capitalization, underlining & boldface that are
deployed like emphatic marks on a canvas. Or notes on a score?  A friend
commented afterwards: "You know it struck me in hearing Maggie read this
time that she approaches the act more like a musician than anybody I've ever
heard."

The final session of the event was from 3:30 to 5:00: the organizers had
hoped to organize a further evening performance of traditional Irish music
but this didn't take place.  Maybe next year!  Anyway, at this session,
Maurice Scully performed selections from several books of his, all of which
make up a single enormous interlinked project (_Five Freedoms of Movement_,
_Livelihood: The Set_, _Tig_).  I've heard Maurice read several times now
(at the 1999 Cork Festival, & at the 1996 New Hampshire conference); this
was definitely the best reading of his I've witnessed, a highly focussed
performance which brought out the musicality & the restless permutations of
the texts as they engage with the substance of daily life: family &
professional routines, the natural world, boredom & frustration & delight.
Again I'll skip typing in some of his poetry as there's some up online at
Sound Eye: http://indigo.ie/~tjac/Poets/Maurice_Scully/maurice_scully.htm

I'm not all that interested in the mix of confessional poetry, barefoot
Earth-Mother persona, performance poetry & the odd bit of singing that was
delivered by Maighread Medbh, mostly delivered straight at the audience from
memory. That said, I was initially sympathetic enough, given my leanings
towards an aesthetic pluralism, and since in the context of some of more
demanding poetries on offer at the Cork conference, such a change of pace
was actually rather welcome. But Medbh disposed of my goodwill by going on
at enormous & self-indulgent length. She overshot her alloted time by about
20 minutes, I reckon, & as things wore on got increasingly self-parodic. A
poem about lying down looking up, for instance, had to be _read_ lying down.

Tom Raworth had asked me a few weeks before Cork if there was anything I'd
like to hear him read: I'd mentioned that I'd never heard him read _Ace_.
He very kindly fulfilled this request at Cork, giving a memorable
performance of a text that presents considerable difficulties to reading:
the earliest of his long poems, it is an unpunctuated column of words,
mostly one to a line, which demands rapid and precise performance.  Poet and
audience are both placed under stress, both of them struggling to keep up
with the text.  Raworth overcame some respiratory difficulties at the end to
deliver the entirety of the poem.  He closed with a detourned version of
Andrew Motion's poem for the Queen Mother (every noun was replaced with the
name of an alcoholic drink).  This was probably the best live performance I'
ve seen Tom give in some time.

And that was Cork 2002, the 6th or 5th festival depending on who's counting.
It was a mostly strong programme that threw up a number of truly fine
readings, & I found the ambience & people very congenial.  I was, in short,
glad I was there.

First published in 1996, Jennifer Heath's powerful novel, "A House White
With Sorrow: Ballad for Afghanistan," has been re-issued in a striking new
special edition that combines text with photographs to produce a haunting
and compelling vision of that beleaguered nation. Not only a great novel, it
is also a stunning piece of art in its own right -- a superlative example of
photo-fiction.

Below is my original review of the book as it first appeared in the Boulder
Daily Camera.

"A House White With Sorrow" may be purchased from SPD, or directly from the
author, Jennifer Heath, by sending a check or credit card number to 1838
Pine Street, Boulder, CO, 80302. Price is $20.00 (includes postage). To

A HOUSE WHITE WITH SORROW
by Jennifer Heath

Reviewed by:  Patrick Pritchett

        When the former Soviet Union confidently blundered its way into
Afghanistan in 1979, a century-old process of political maneuvering known as
the Great Game achieved its horrific culmination and the journalistic
epithet "afghanistanism," formerly employed to denote the obscure and
unimportant, acquired a new and dreadful meaning.
        "A House White With Sorrow," by Boulder novelist Jennifer Heath, is
the story of that time and what led up to it.  "House" is a harrowing and
elegiac tale of two cultures and two families, one American, the other
Afghan, and of their intertwined destinies.  "What is a man without his
clan?" this novel asks.  For reply, it conducts us on a tour of life during
wartime in which the narrowness of purely nationalist concerns is stripped
away to reveal the deeper aspects of the human condition.  Along the way,
love is shattered and rebuilt; hope betrayed and renewed; families are
sundered, then reunited, but not always in happiness.
        Heath, who spent her teenage years in Afghanistan as an "embassy
brat," has achieved no mere distillate of autobiography here, but a rich,
complex story in which the personal and the political are deftly juxtaposed.
The novel unfolds in mosaic-like episodes, ala John Dos Passos' "U.S.A.
Trilogy" and Sartre's "The Reprieve," criss-crossing back and forth in time
between 1959 and the entry of the Sayyid family into Washington's diplomatic
community, and the early 1980's, when Afghanistan struggles to expel the
invading "Shovaree shayytans," the Russian devils, from their homeland.
Across three decades, the eccentric, dysfunctional, charismatic Crowell
family and the equally dynamic and divided Sayyids, progressive members of
the ruling Pushtun clan, find themselves both making history and caught up
in its unconscious undertow.
        In Heath's vision, history operates on two planes at once: as that
which we shape, and as that which in turn shapes us.  No grand synthesis
emerges from this dialectic, though.  Instead, what comes to occupy the
median is the ability of human beings to choose, to exercise radical
self-awareness in the crucible of extreme pressures.  Out of existential
crisis, personal transcendence may be born.
        A chorus of voices narrates the flow of feeling and action.  Through
them, we overhear the continual quarrel between hope and doubt, affirmation
and negation, in short, the human conversation. There's Alauddin Sayyid, a
Western-trained physician, who vacillates between his comfortable lifestyle
far from grief, and the urgent call of his homeland for commitment.  His
on-again/off-again lover, Carey Crowell, daughter of an American consul,
similarly struggles with her conscience as she seeks to come to grips with
her feelings for Alauddin, and her ambivalent affections for her domineering
mother Jeanette.
        It's Jeanette's voice which rings with the greatest panache. By
turns irreverent, shrewish, comic, heroic and just giddily drunk, in the end
it is unfailingly decent, the moral pivot at the center of all the
characters' tangled allegiances.  Her strength is the strength which all
mothers and great women share: elastic, yet unyielding, and tempered by a
delightfully caustic wit, whether she is struggling against the Afghan
custom of purdah (the separation of women from all men but their relatives),
or smuggling diplomats' wives out of the country via an underground railway.
        The novel's structure obviates suspense.  Linear time no longer
plays its familiar role in revealing character and building theme and
incident.  Instead, Heath constructs another, subtler kind of tension, more
psychological than dramatic.  When we first meet Alauddin and Carey, for
instance, they are husband and wife; he, following the mujahidin into battle
as a field medic; she, nursing the wounded across the border in Pakistan.
As we prepare to leave the lovers, they are caught up in the throes of
deciding whether or not to marry.  (In a grim yet poignant touch
characteristic of the book, they communicate via the "Trauma Express," a
courier system in which letters are transported through the bodies of the
slain or wounded). Far from impeding our involvement with the characters,
this fractured chronology deepens it.  Memory, afterall, is dyslexic.
Identity is to be grasped as process, not product.  In mapping the
stratigraphy of self, one place is probably as good as any other in which to
start. "House" is by no means a journey of wistful Proustian recall. It's
packed with high drama.  This is a story about war: its panics and alarms,
its furious attacks and mad flights; its profound savagery, its even
profounder compassion.
        For centuries, Afghanistan has hovered near the antipodes of
Eurocentric thought, an exotic region populated by the racist, sexist and
imperialist fantasies of Empire, whether British, Russian, or American.
Jennifer Heath has rescued it from the miasma of misconception, telling the
tale of its betrayal and dismemberment, both from within and without, with
writing that is swift, sure and lyrical.  Vivid, immediate and underscored
by genuine pathos, "A House White With Sorrow" belongs to that rare species
of the American novel, the kind that engage us not only emotionally, but
ethically, too.

I'm not ready to let this question die yet. First I want to bring up a
couple of writers who aren't generally recognized as writers at all (at
least not by other writers): Jean-Michel Basquiat's drawings & canvases,
but especially his drawings, are some of the greatest poetry produced in
the 1980s. Maybe it's the hundreds of thousands they fetch that make them
hard to recognize as "visual poetry" -- whatever the reason, they really
are deserving of more "literary" attention. The best US poetry of the 1990s
is in the books of Mark Gonzales, a world-renowned skateboarder and artist
who is still producing photocopied books under the rubric "Non Stop
Poetry/Cujo Arts and Literature." They're hard to find, but Printed Matter
in NY carries them, & not too expensive. So often you hear of artists who
"use texts" in their work, which is so absurd --just because it's in magic
marker or spray-paint and involves non-textual material shouldn't remove it
from the realm of "poetry."

I'm glad Jerrold mentions Robert Grenier --has anyone else wondered about
Larry Eigner's influence on his turn to handwritten forms? I know they hung
out a lot...

And finally I want to repeat my question to those poets who release their
work exclusively in type. Is it for convenience? community? or do you feel
that type is essentially the best vehicle for your written work? It might
just be -- this is not some trap I'm setting -- but I want to hear it
formulated & not simply assumed. Jerrold has tendon problems, and Jason
Christie's handwriting was ruined by his "correction" class. There are a
lot more of you out there, though, I've seen your work. Jason rightly notes
that the pen is no less a technological device than the typewriter or
computer or any other instrument for producing written forms. Fine, but
what why is type the unmarked inscriptive medium for poetry, and everything
else gets marked as " 'visual' poetry"? Like type's not visual? Sorry to
sound like such a hot-head but I am one LRSN

worth mentioning, as well, are Adolf Wolfli...take a look, also, at the
recent Russian Avant-Garde Book exhibit at the MOMA (which Ron posted a link
to a while back)...Niedecker's calender poem (reprinted in the recent
collected)...

& since David brought up spray-paint, I should also point out that graffiti
artists refer to themselves as "writers"...

I would like it to be noted that I just sent a stack of poems to my friend
Kevin, who makes comics, in the hope he might be able to "do something with"
some of them, perhaps resulting in a collaborative book. I'd been thinking
about this direction for awhile, having had no luck shopping my MS around a
few presses, and actually being skeptical about traditionally printed poetry
books anyway (of which there're so fucking many!), and also having moved
toward dialog/episodiic narrative in my own work. But it feels more than a
little narcissistic trying to populate another artist's imagination with my
own texts, especially Kevin's which is so fertile already--

 http://www.usscatastrophe.com/kh/greentea.html

An example of my work in dialogs is here--
 http://www.jacketmagazine.com/15/belz.html

Admittedly it's not a perfect match, but dammit, I want to see little people
speaking my lines! !  And handlettered in that cool comic-book style we've
all come to trust.

Maybe I should turn to puppeteering or something.  Or retelling Marx
Brothers movie scenes as party anecdotes (a favorite art form of mine).

-Aaron Belz


P.S. As to the skepticism about books, or traditionally printed matter, what
have you, that's a whole 'nother thread. I would like to be able to pick up
a book or a printed journal and think, "Hmm, something new, something
valuable," but so often just because of the white paper and black text and
little page numbers and endpapers and precious blurbs and author photo and
bio and "note on the type" and colophon and table of contents-- shit I've
just seen so MANY BOOKS, reviewed so many, read so many as school
assignments, picked up so many that looked interesting, stocked/inventoried
so many for Shakespeare & Co back in the day, for Waldenbooks back in
another life, wrote advertisements and planned marketing campaigns for so
many, I feel kind of SUNBLINDED or something. Isn't there a psychological
term for this? Like, having eaten too many candy bars, one forgets where to
put the wrappers?  I need a new high.  -A

This looks really odd to me in the context of the
recent posts about the demise of small press poetry
publishing in Canada.
Ho well - it's a wunnerful world innit...

Thanks, Millie. I'd like to see that in headlines, in the kind of mock
newspaper you get at anniversaries. A lot of a parodic nature could be done
with it. Write such banners for FLP?

A propos different levels of statement that begin to refer to a common
thread in *Progress*, I overheard a conversation in a restaurant
today--tech people in the auto business, discussing a programming problem.
There were "routines," "compilers," and "libraries" in this program. The
senior technician figure (i.e. the dominant conversational partner) was
laying out the function of the program and kept switching between nouns and
verbs, components and their functions. Compilers compile, routines just sit
there and do their routines (when called on), and "libraries library."
There were a number of sentences in which something libraried something
else or was libraried (similar to the ways compilers compiled). I'm
interested in the gap between the grammatically normative construction
(compilers compile) and the "deviant" but potentially acceptable
formulation (libraries library) as it was being developed in the
discussion. In linguistics, this distinction might be indicated by:

compilers compile
? libraries library
* routines routine (not said)

Now imagine this as a kind of paradigm for constructed sentences in a
series. Some are very straightforward, have "content," grammatically
organized. Some stretch the possibilities in some way. Some are deviant
clinkers. I'm interested in the way the total discourse takes on meaning
through these relations, and gives value to them.

Second question: what is the relation of the grammar of these sentences and
the "state of affairs" they represent? How does the acceptability of
"libraries library" depend on what a library is? Of course it does depend
on what a library is, but precisely how? This was a faultline in
linguistics circa 1980--between "context-independent" and
"context-dependent" syntax.

You might say the poem itself is a kind of compiler, possibly a library,
but not a routine (i.e., there were not "procedures" that generated what
came next--it was written by a human hand, on an electric typewriter,
1981-82; I wasn't thinking of those devices).

A Quiz (apologies to Paul Hoover):

True or false?

1. Poetry predates writing and possibly the opposable thumb.

2. Language comes from lingua i.e. tongue, that thing in your mouth.

3. The "line" is not fundamental to poetry, being a printer's contrivance.

4. Olson wrote: "What we have suffered from, is manuscript..."

5. You could write out a Creeley poem breaking the lines any way you liked
and the poem would lose none of its pleasure.

6. Dickinson wasn't sure which versions she liked better and didn't think
she was under any pressure to decide, publication being the auction of the
mind of man, etc.

7. Listening to The Waste Land is a greater experience than reading the poem.

8. A blind person could never be a first-rate poet.

9. Interest in handwriting possibly an expression of consumer nostalgia.
Cf. Martha Stewart and http://www.levenger.com/

Cy Twombly is an example of a painter who incorporates handwritten poems
(by Rilke & so weiter).

Susan Wood reproduces her notebooks in Source Codes (intended as a saucy
gesture, I suppose -- yeah, whatever...).

Pam. There's some interesting stuff on this site and i had a quick look at
some of the mags. The poems in Tinfish for eg were interesting. Jacket I've
seen before and it is good: the discussion on The Big Smoke ws
interesting... the point about Baxter I think that its true he needs a
reevaluation: as unfortuantely he has been liked almost "for the wrong
reasons" (or liked by too many people!) so a lot of us have turned say to
Kendrick Smithyman: that said he was a great  poet of a kind...problem for
me with him is that I hear so much about Baxter and have neen reading him
occasionally sine I think 1969 when he wrote quite "intellectual"  and very
good poems: great in fact ... but The Big Smoke misssed me out! Reason: I
only published one thing in 1970 (the first thing I ever submitted an the
last for many years).(Actaully it was a story that began as a description of
the freezing works where I worked some seasons in the sixties). BUT - What
was the REAL tragedy of The Big Smoke story: that I didnt know I was going
to become  a book dealer! My friend Jim the Ant had a poem given to him
(handwritten) by Baxter when we were on a "protest" jaunt to Wellington ...
I forgot about  it until I discovered latterly that such things have
considerable fiscal value: but The Ant lost it! but I actually havent read
much of Baxter's poetry which is a bit silly as I dont really know if i like
him!  Some I remember as only conventially good...(I realise that there's a
hell of a lot more than things about Baxter etal in Jacket,....but didnt
have time  for those just yet: its obviously a good mag...)

 So that's the great New Zealand Tragedy...joking of course: the review of
Leggott...well she gets (rightly) accoladed every where..she must be one of
the world's greatest poets..many others even "famous" poets we all know look
weak side her...but any case that's an interesting site...your poems "aren't
my style" overall (not saying they're 'bad") ( I like to rave and "boom")
but that said you have some good lines: and I liked the one with the fortune
cooky: the light touch...also some of your poems with the australiasian tone
I could relate to...some interesting stuff.  Thanks again, Richard.

How about Kenneth Patchen as a Jandwriting poet?  He painted poems.  MOstly
one liner, but also painted illustrations to large numbers of poems.  There
is a large format book calle What Shall We Do Without Us? Of of the big
painted poems in color, and Wanderings and Double featues have dome
paintings in them.

I think her name is Susan _Wheeler_. Don't you like sauce, Andrew? I get
your point, about the essential orality of poetry. I don't buy it, though.
Language comes from the tongue, and so has this essential somatic quality
which transcends all written vehicles for it. Strange, then, that you would
use the somatic trope of the "gesture" to dismiss Wheeler's reproduction of
her notebooks in _Source Codes_, as if the gesture were some second-order
signifier. Is speech not gestural? Isn't the tongue _moving around_ as it
produces the verbal sign in collaboration w/ the lips & larynx? What about
its important role in non-verbal gestures, like when we stick it out at
each other? I don't think I need to point out the (material) gesturality of
handwriting --it's the (metaphorical) gesturality of type I'm trying to get
at. Maybe the question for Susan Wheeler should be what she meant by
putting the handwritten versions of her poems at the end of her book, or
why she chose to reproduce them in type at all.

One of the things I love about Brendan Lorber's magazine _Lungfull!_ is its
the title's citation of the breath (more necessary than the tongue, I might
contend, for oral communication and art), even as it presents all these
handwritten compositions. The hand-bone's connected to the lung-bone,
y'all. And the tongue-bone. I'd ask him why the qualifier "rough drafts"
for the handwritten element, but I think everyone gets the picture LRSN

yes me too i also think instead of copious footnotes to bulk up publication
TS Eliot could've opted for inserting handwritten versions of his poems but
hey i bet Viv wrote most of them band I'm busy worrying about my
constitutional rights going up ashcroft's ass Sheila

He wrote a very good autobiography several years ago called "Not =

and was rather depressed.  But the book made him sound like a thoroughly =

listmates, let me put in a word on this thread for Bob Grenier. I believe
his somewhat encoded handwritings may be found at a website run by Karl
Young?  There is also a book of them from Simonr Fattal's press, a thing of
beauty and, unfortunately, some cost---in excess of a hundred bucks, I
believe. David

& David & Andrew especially -- The handwritten appendices are in there
because SALT's books are at least 100 pages and I didn't have
them.  Someone suggested drafts, given the nature of the book, which I
dismissed immediately, not wanting that sort of fetishing, until the idea
of a sandwiched appendix of HTML source code came up -- which I hoped would
deflate the "gesture" of that other sourcing.  Since the rest of the book
was set up using a pattern of links between images and poems, which
determined the sequencing of these, the appendices seemed to have an energy
that worked along with this, as I played with the book's construction. Hope
this clears this up.

I just got back from an extended tour of Asia, so I missed the Handwriting
Poetry party.  Did people say clever things?  I really hope they did.  Is
there any wine and cheese left?  Does anyone want to sum it all up and

I rather like writing at the top.

Also, I think it best to not use Outlook, at least with mailing lists.  I
hate having to do what I am about to do which is clip your (Derek R)
address out of the To line, cut the Poetics out of the CC line, and then
put in the To line.  Give me a Reply-To, or give me...well.

I rather like writing at the top.

my sense (possibly gleaned form lingua franca or some such thing) is
that he's one of these folks who became disenchanted with theory,
recanted on his earlier writings and started writing fiction (or
autobiography as millie suggests)...

oops, no sorry, that's frank lentricchia i'm thinking of (see lingua
france sept/oct 1996). but i gather kermode's take is not too different.
see his essay "the academy vs. the humanities"

Rephrasing of the problem.  I use a unix-based email system.  Typically,
when I get an email from a listserv, it includes a Reply-To option, which
allows me to send to the list only.  But it seems to me when mail is sent
to the list via Outlook, the message doesn't have that option for me.  I'm
pretty careful about double-sending, but I've seen other people tripped
up.

I'm curious to know if this a fault of Outlook.  Since I know my system
sometimes gives me the Reply-To option, I know it exists in it.

I don't know why you need to do this. This seems like a waste of time.
To reply to a listserv message, simply select the "Reply" button, "Reply
to All' button, or use the keyboard "Ctrl-R" w/ MS.

You can even "Forward" your messages back to the listserv for all I
care.


>I'm curious to know if this a fault of Outlook

It certainly isn't the fault of the listserv or it's members. I would
suggest archiving your Outlook files and contacts and uninstalling the
application, then re-installing it. The "Reply" button should always do
just that -- reply, but clearly you will have to correct your own
implementation.

__________________________________


In all truthfulness, it is embarrassing for me to have to have to
indicate to members of this list how to write, really fucking
embarrassing.

"Rules" are for everyone's benefit and are not cast in stone. It is just
pain-staking obvious to me that blindly-replying to a message without
editing out the quoted material to a digestible size is, well, blind.

Is there even anyone brave enough, (or in this case stupid enough), to
subscribe to the Digest version of this listserv?

I think putting everyone on digest-mode would demonstrate what I am
trying to say pretty quickly. Sort-of like a Listserv Judgment Day,
where everyone gets to reap what they've sown.

But the poets don't get it. This truly appears to be over-yr-head. And I
must say that anyone who cannot figure out how to compose an email meant
to be read (and understood) by others on a reading list is not much of a
writer, and I would suggest those people get out of the word-business --
for behold, ye know not what ye do.

I would also like to make connections on this list to other
(practical/real-world) lists of similar subject matter, and vice-versa.
Of course, I feel this way because what the members of this list have to
contribute is of great value, and should be shared (communicative).

However, currently the list is very difficult to read and a barrier to
understanding. Pointing to it as a resource would not only undermine my
credibility, but more importantly the list's as well. I would hope the
point-of-discourse for members is not *to avoid* contact with the "real"
world.

This solipsistic reliance on style over substance will come back to bite
you in the ass.

Derek,

You shouldn't try to *force* a behavior model on people; the trick is to
know user behavior, and to take advantage of it
(http://www.derekrogerson.com).

I'll register my small opinion that it's not hard to follow the discussions
at UB Poetics. Aside from the occasional posturing and temper tantrums, it's
a delightful list and I've learned a lot here.

Ciao,
Aaron

Right half contro9ls left side of body, etc, whatever your dominant half
is. But the usual new-age right-left stuff switches--left handers use the
right side of the brain for stuff that right handers use the left for. But
there's a bit of claptrap in this--there appear to be tendencies associated
with particular sides, but each hemisphere is capable of doing the whole
thing, as it does in the brain-injured.

The only way to bypass the brain would be to rely on the autonomic nerve
system, but I doubt that it's capable of words, or even letters. One can
bypass in a limited way certain kinds of consciousness.

Why would one want to bypass the brain any more than one would wish to
bypass the feet or the genitals?

Susan: Thanks for the behind-the-scenes info.

David: Erk, that was dumb of me.  It was the sauce talking.

All:

Although I think Wheeler occasionally relies too much on the pose of
girlish insouciance (to be distinguished from the boyish insouciance of, I
don't know, some of Muldoon's poems), I find a lot to like in this book and
hope others will check it out.

One poem was published earlier by Slate and can be seen here:

http://slate.msn.com/?id=77409


I think the strength of this poem is the way it explores a self-consciously
middle-class, urban perspective on the rest of the country.  In
conspicuously figurative language, it describes looking out the window in
the middle of a flight from SF to NYC.  Wheeler's similes seem like
arbitrary nuttiness until you realize that she is drawing on sights typical
of city life: paintings in art museums, boutique chocolates, fabrics in
catalogs, odd haircuts, basketball shoes, cats ("Abyssinian's / mussed fur
post grooming's blue rinse").  So you've got an artsy, intellectual poet
trying to describe the look of rural country from 30,000 feet, and falling
back on the images she knows best.  When she tries to imagine life down
there in Nebraska, she only comes up with slightly cliched scenes of
futility ("truant pouring cup of gin") which recall Hopper paintings or
maybe naturalist novels.  In the end, the country over which she is flying
remains simply the "variegated field of what is between" i.e. between the
cities on the two coasts, which, so the poem implies, ia where the real
life of the nation takes place.

actually there are times where i prefer the complete text of the e-mail
being replied to...the context of the replies, in this case, is not
selective...we get the entire posts of both respondents...

seems quite easy to follow to me...has been for the past few years i've been

If the lists have open archives, or, more usually, where (as I do) you have
the thread on a hard disk, snipping is a matter of focus.

There's a difference between this and (biased) selective quotation.

Argumentatively, the latter is a sure method of shooting oneself in the
foot -- all the respondent has to do is retrieve the original context, or
point to the complete post.

Horses for courses, surely.

there is no one way to write, dear boy.  And, besides, how can something
you do so voluntarily be so "embarrassing"?

This is semantic BS.  The term "blind-reply" was developed by people who
don't like the practice to explain the practice.  In other words, your
logic is circular--a dangerous practice for someone who claims to be
studied in it (http://derekrogerson.com/).

Poets may not "get it," but they aren't SUPPOSED to.  The poet's job is
creation--working words.  The archivist and the editor are perhaps what you
are looking for. Like it or not, on an unmoderated, or lightly moderated,
listserv, the computer is the only one in that role, posterity be
damned.  If you want stability and framework, you want another medium.

Again, listservs are not designed with posterity in mind--they are an
ad-hoc medium with improvisational organization.  They are only "very
difficult to read" in their archive form.  If you participate in them
daily, they make sense as conversation; they were not meant to be
comprehended as an archive, though the archives can be read.

And if pointing to it as a resource would undermine your credibility, then
why do you do so on http://derekrogerson.com/ ?

>This solipsistic reliance on style over substance will come back to bite
>you in the ass.

The constant yearning for order without content will too.

A listserv can exist without an archive, but the archive would be empty
without the listserv's conversations.

tom,
   these are two very different people, with different histories vis a vis
theory; Kermode of an earlier generation of British scholars and still, as
always, someone to read. The most recent piece I recall being a review of
Tom Paulin's latest in the LRB.  Frank K. was 'sexy' briefly in the
mid-sixties, when he almost transcended his Englishness.  He's pre-theory,
but that doesn't matter. Frank L. is younger,  not pre-theory
and American, more liable to zeitgeist mood-swings.

my sense (possibly gleaned form lingua franca or some such thing) is
that he's one of these folks who became disenchanted with theory,
recanted on his earlier writings and started writing fiction (or

oops, no sorry, that's frank lentricchia i'm thinking of (see lingua

Dear List Lovers,

Don't get me wrong.

1.  I find some of what A.S. does of interest, but

2.  I think that with the wealth of web and other magazines available and
all that virgin webspace outside of this discussion list, A.S. should take
pity on those who are not quite as taken with his work as others are and
send links to his creative work instead of complete texts.  He should also
clearly identify his creative vs. discussion postings so that those who are
less interested in his creative offerings may still take a look at what he
says.

3.  The last time this came up on the Poetics list I said nary a word.  My
computer was still young.  But now I notice that Alan has taken up a
considerable amount of space in my deleted files--pages and pages of
space--of To Nikuko and Not To Nikuko and on and on and I really think that
it's all a bit unfair.  I didn't sign up to the A.S. list, I signed up to
the Poetics List.

4.  Yes, and the nay-sayers were shouted down more or less the last time.
But please consider, A.S., before you bomb us with another To or Not to
Nikuko that there are some people who are on this list for other reasons
than reading your collected works.

5.  I'm not attempting to bash anyone here, it's just a matter of a visitor
at your electronic table who refuses to go away, refuses to take a break,
and continues to play his two-stringed fiddle with very little variation on
the tune.  After awhile you begin to wish that one of those strings might
break.

Dear Mr. Glass,

We are sorry to hear that your delete key is malfunctioning. On most
keyboards there is a key clearly marked "delete." Should this fail to
function, contact your technical support representative immediately.

Seriously, don't even the most primitive mail clients support filters,
in which you take perhaps two minutes to sit down and instruct your
computer to consign all messages from Alan Sondheim directly to the bit bucket?

Personally, I find it refreshing to have some actual poetry, some
honest-to-whatever poetics being enacted, in between all the rhetorical puffery.

I like it when this list isn't merely announcements of this or that
(although I keep a mail folder marked Books To Get), and I think Alan
Sondheim's posts help make it so.

Signed, U.Y.F.D.K.

Well, I send out maybe 350 texts/year, slightly less than one/day. The
average line length is around 72 chars. If you hit the delete key once a
day, that makes slightly less than five lines of text, which isn't much.
I'm writing more to answer you now and none of them are deletes.

Please note first that Nikuko hasn't been around for quite a while. I
don't know where she is, but she's not particularly present. Second, my
work isn't poetry so much as poetics - that should be evident. The work
resonates with the Net, with this email list, with the correspondents on
this list. It contributes through example rather than critical discourse
or direct discussion participation.

I apologize if you find it difficult to delete 1-2 posts a day (mostly 1,
sometimes 2, sometimes none). There are people on all the lists I'm on who
write more than I by a long shot, and I have no difficulty deleting them.

I am glad that Alan is sending his work online: its cazy stuff and i like a
lot of it: better than a lot of  other stuff (better than so many boring
announcements or who won what prize or what old dead balls died recently -
given that many such announcements are requisite - but Allan's work I like
to see on). At least he's MAKING...which is what a poet is, a maker, a DOER,
a DARER, A CONSTRUCTOR... I think that Wystan is agreeing that this site is
for theory and practice and as well as the discussion for eg on the merits
of langpo, its difficulty (which spreads into the general question of
difficulty and even into "what is poetry") we have people send poems,
quipping and other: so there's some phatic language and some poetry, as well
as some theory and some announcements and links.  Its good enough: very
good. Richard. PS I delete a lot of stuff but I'm "collecting " Alan's work!
Even if Alan is "bad" (if he is and who can tell?) I still like the idea of
Alan!

"A Prophetic ferocity joins visceral appetite in Garrett Kalleberg's
powerful new collection, spirit and matter couple to spawn a ravishing
anxiety, 'a beautiful disaster.' As if language were a skin wrapped around
the world's body which ruptures and spills its will to be named." - Ann
Lauterbach


"Drawing variously from the rhetorics of science, religion, psychology, and
metaphysics, Kalleberg investigates the place where proof and belief overlap
in a logical moire--" - Heather Ramsdell


"I found a book (The Monster Lives of Boys & Girls), learned the beloved's
possible name, watched a 'body lost also in beauty, sadness, simple joys'
and intellection..."
- Eleni Sikelianos


Garrett Kalleberg is the author of Psychological Corporations (Spuyten
Duyvil), Limbic Odes (Heart Hammer), and co-author of a forthcoming play
"The Situation Room." His work has appeared in Talisman, Sulfur, Denver

delete your deleted messages!  They don't need to sit there taking up space
if you're confident you don't want them!   And with two messages a day, no
one can post too much.   think 2 messages a day is too harsh a limit myself.

what is really weird and seems beyond rules !!!

Is the few days when Alan Sondheim was on the road

He sent no emails

There was nothing on 3 lists

Tumbleweeds

The day Alan when on Vacation

The poetry stopped

And I thought my computer was broken

Or worse

The internet had died

                I love Alan

        This is Alan's art - email

help him defend that right

Dear List Lovers,

Don't get me wrong.

1.  I find some of what A.S. does of interest, but

2.  I think that with the wealth of web and other magazines available and
all that virgin webspace outside of this discussion list, A.S. should take
pity on those who are not quite as taken with his work as others are and
send links to his creative work instead of complete texts.  He should also
clearly identify his creative vs. discussion postings so that those who are
less interested in his creative offerings may still take a look at what he
says.

3.  The last time this came up on the Poetics list I said nary a word.  My
computer was still young.  But now I notice that Alan has taken up a
considerable amount of space in my deleted files--pages and pages of
space--of To Nikuko and Not To Nikuko and on and on and I really think that
it's all a bit unfair.  I didn't sign up to the A.S. list, I signed up to
the Poetics List.

4.  Yes, and the nay-sayers were shouted down more or less the last time.
But please consider, A.S., before you bomb us with another To or Not to
Nikuko that there are some people who are on this list for other reasons
than reading your collected works.

5.  I'm not attempting to bash anyone here, it's just a matter of a visitor
at your electronic table who refuses to go away, refuses to take a break,
and continues to play his two-stringed fiddle with very little variation on
the tune.  After awhile you begin to wish that one of those strings might
break.

Alan's longstanding project of posting everything to the list that comes
into his head is at least more interesting than Gwyn McVay's practice of
posting nothing to the list but snotty remarks.

I want briefly to reply to the idea that I send out whatever comes into my
head -

First, any text of course has come into the head and left it, distorted or
not, the coming and going far too complex to analyze here

In terms of my own writing, I reject more than half of it, send out work
to other lists, not Poetics necessarily

There is always a matrix. For example, the past two days - the language is
from Korean spam stripped of its 8th ascii bit, leaving only the residue
behind. You might or might not recognize it, but certainly the Click pre-
sents it in the context of email/hypertext. The texts are spaced as in the
originals to some extent; the postman/mailman one, however, was also sent
through a catalyst program in perl; the program had a mountains and rivers
vocabulary - the email sent through routers, disturbances, returning with
blanks, gaps, open or negative space. There are zen/ch'an references here
which I've been exploring.

But so what? What is left in the residue of the spam in any case? For me
an imaginary of transport and desire - disembodied, disarticulated mail-
and post-man, gendered within a fluid economy - the second Click Click
Love bringing that home to the lineaments of desire.

And in terms of poetics/Poetics? Here is the (7-bit) surface of email,
emptying out - transport/desire manifest in the residue of content and
protocols.

I never felt the need to write the above; I'm doing it defensively as an
indication that I'm neither fooling around with commands or writing the
first thing that comes into my head - I see this whole 'period' of my work
as dealing with codes, protocols, the phenomenology of approach -

Apologies for going on at |------------------<| length here -

Alan

Can you say a little more about this? -- i.e. how do these resonances
relate to the phenomenology of approach? Is it a way of situating
loss/slippage/rupture, or 'maintaining' openness opened up in
transmission etc...or ?

thanks, Ryan (and do keep posting to the list, of course! I wish more
people would send their creative/theoretical texts)

An otherwise quite interesting psychoanalyst, Christopher Bollas, in a
somewhat pedestrian essay on poetics quotes Helen Vendler as follows: "Form,
after all, is nothing but content-as-arranged" (from-The Music of What
Happens, 1988). The occasional efforts to house train Alan Sondheim on this
list prove not only the unlikelihood of Vendler's quote, but, here, anyway,
its veritable impossibility, eh Barrett? It's not only his forms or his
contents, I suspect, that we unneatfreaks like about Alan's presence here,
but something which partakes of, but transcends both, I suspect. Something
called -chops-.
En tout cas, perhaps I've reached my anecdotage, but lately I enjoy most
every discussion on this list, even the handwriting, or handwringing, ones
Ms Damon, as the cases might be. Roll on Alan, list, caissons, digest
lovers, reply button users, nay sayers, well wishers... And where might be
Mr. Kazim Ali and Louis Cabri?

and you can also set up a delete rule with most email clients so yr don't even
know it existed in the first place.

if yr that bothered about it.

maybe we should have a homage a Sondheim? - yr know, each send a poem in the
style of Alan.

Nick may be hinting at the usage in psychotherapy of "material" as that
which is produced in the day in, day out dialogue of the sessions. Which of
course is one way of thinking about the kind of "content" that is being
produced here--we have "databases," providing lots of neutralized
information, and then the sediment of history, memory, affect, and
projection that gives us what--? which arrives at the distinction between
information and knowledge. If we start to think in terms of a phenomenology
of information--the way information is "intended"--we are getting into an
area of "part-voices" and "recombinant selves" that seems to be one way to
process procedurally generated work. Here I'll shift from textual examples
to an example from another media--Detroit techno. What's interesting about
this work, when it is, is the surfacing of submerged "part-voices" and
"recombinant selves" in the repetition and collision of polyrhythmic
structures. What is the "content" of Detroit techno? Something's coming up,
but from where? There is a kind of global preconscious at work in the form.
Other genres of art that break down processing boundaries, of whatever
sort--the lyric poem, the sentence, the morpheme, as well as various ways
of recombining these broken down entities--allow the foregrounding of such
"repressed" contents or unaccessible elements--as we see, for instance, in
avant-garde film after Vertov. It's the degree to which these contents or
elements compel recognition that interests me. It used to be that
recognition was only compelled by identity statements or knowledge
statements--"I know this" or "such is the case." But procedural form allows
us to recognize the intentional states of partial representations. The
question, then, is--what do we do with them? If these partial
representations are also the case, "to what distinction"? I hope not merely
aesthetic pleasure is the answer.

What do you mean by you don't want merely to impart aesthetic pleasure?  I
can see that the word aesthetic may be wrong...it may be more the pleasure
of thought, and intellectual ticklicng arising from issues raised in the
poem, but do you really see poetry as having a (higher?) value other tan
imoparting (whatever sort) of pleasure?  Imparting pleasure is the beasic
rasion d'etre of all literature...it is only forced on people and studied in
schools and turned into work out of fear that people will not have to
abiolity to appreciate the literature without study, and society seems to
think that it is worthwhile to make sure that there is aloways a small
contingent of people who can analyze a poem or read Shakespeare or Beowulf
or read Aristiphanies and get the jokes.  But literature in the academy
seems to me like a protective carde -- they are saving the literature for
future generations, for instance so that I, when a seventeen year old
studnet at college, could be made to read a semester's worth of Greek and
Latin plays with a professor who had read and understood the originals.  The
knowledge and dare I say it pleasure and especially FUTURE pleasure I got
from this was due to the continued study of literature throughout history.
Future pleasure is the point, because the Classics were more fun becauise
they openeed the way to other literature and to using Classic elements in my
own works than they were actually to read at the time, when I wasn't perhaps
mature enough to enjoy them.   So literature is about deferred
pleasure...you study it and read books you don't enjoy at the time for the
sake of the literature youu will be able to enjoy in the future because of
your incrteased (cultural) literarcy. But nonetheless, to me it seems to be
about pleasure in some form.

I get the idea that you think that poetry actually makes progress in some
gfield in which discoveroes are called for.  That we learn from poetry
things particular to it that are useful beyond whatever pleasure tey give,
and I'm not sure I can follow you there.  I mean, poetry teaches us some how
our own minds work and that is progress in the field of cognitive science, I
suppose, but ut isn't codified in a usable way.  So I don't think poetry has
a purpose (except an extended pleasure-giving as above).  I mean, it's
possible that it has some moral value: that people who read poetry develop
more subtle inds, become better people making finer judgments, and so on,
but that sounds a lot like self-justifcation on the part of people who read
and write poetry.

Mind you I think most things have little purpose other than the pleasure
they give.  I used to be in pre mathematics, and it is completely an
aesthetic field.  Moreover, it gives its practitioners about an equal
measure of pain and pleasure, but the pleasure is highly addictive -- you
can literally math yourself into insanity or death.  I was told not to go to
Princeton, wherte I was offered a fellowship, because all the students went
crazy apparently (and the John Nash story was not current then), but by that
point I had lost the edge anyway and couldn't have done the necessary math.
But it was totally useless.

It is not surprising that many things are useless.  After all we are on
earth briefly and minus religion have no duties other than having fun and
helping our fellow humans have fun.  The reason this doesn't lead to toital
iduklgence is that fin in the long term requires sacrufices in the short
term.  There was somme philosopher who said "we work so as not to have to
work."  Helping others is a positive goal not based on selff indulgence
except that when one is successful at helping others there are internal (and
often external) rewards.

P.S> Barrett or someone: could you forward tis to poetics if it doesn't
reach there.  I probably used up my second one last night telling that
person to just delete Alan's messages if he doesn't like them...

Good defense of pleasure, which like motherhood and apple pie, no one is
going to seriously deny. However, let's begin with why your response picks
up on the one sentence at the end of the post that deals with the limits of
"aesthetic pleasure." What is it that motivates the fierce response--is it
the idea that I would be taking something away, making it forbidden? You
can't have that merely self-indulgent aesthetic pleasure, because I say so.
Pushes a button--gets a response.

Here I would suggest that recognition is much more of a factor than
pleasure, in life. "You are denying my pleasure--I want it back." I want
pleasure to be recognized as a legitimate human goal, etc. The question is,
is "recognition" itself--of pleasure, or identity, or whatever--a matter of
pleasure entirely? Are we entirely pleased when we are recognized? Or is
there something else going on that has to do with the nature of the denial
of recognition? In the end, I will claim that recognition is a much more
important motivation than "mere aesthetic pleasure" in the arts.

Which leads to another form of pleasure, that is not "merely aesthetic."
What about the pleasure that comes, for instance, in the resolution of a
conflict? I remember going into a Sears Roebuck one day after a long and
successful strike. The workers had won what they wanted. And I was looking
at this lady at the jewelry counter, who seemed entirely transformed by
this renewed contract, let's say, with the conditions of her employment.
This is not aesthetic pleasure, and one of the uses of aesthetic pleasure
has been to limit that which is legitimate as pleasure, in the arts, to
that which is inutile, "does nothing." But winning a strike is not inutile,
and is pleasurable.

Speaking of displeasure, nothing could be more inappropriate, seem to give
more displeasure, than to talk labor politics in an art gallery. Almost
worse than pornography in church. Where that isn't the case, that's the art
gallery I want to go to.

To return to the thread, what about the other material on the table,
besides the hit on pleasure?

MATERIAL
--after Barrett Watten & Jean Passerat


What is the "content" of Detroit techno?
Something's coming up, but from where?
I hope not merely aesthetic pleasure.

What's interesting about this work when it is
Recombining these broken down entities?
What is the "content" of Detroit techno?

It used to be that recognition
Was only compelled by identity statements--
I hope not!  Merely aesthetic pleasure....

We have "databases" providing neutralized information
Which is produced day in, day out:
What is the "content" of Detroit techno?

There is a kind of global preconscious;
The question, then, is what do we do?
I hope not merely aesthetic pleasure,

And then the sediment of history, memory, affect,
And projection that gives us what--?
What is the "content" of Detroit techno?
I hope not merely aesthetic pleasure.

Nick,

Barrett brought a couple of things to the 'table' this morning. One is
content as therapeutic material and the other is his use of 'procedural
form'.

I tend to think of poetry as procedurerather than form and I thinkthat's in
the experimental langpo way of thinking and I also think that there are many
who don't grasp the idea that there are two things happening - I suspect due
to the poverty of the English language (and its poetics and philosophical
offshoots).  The third way here (poetic procedure) might loosen some of the
dilemmic dichotomous thinking that revolves around form/content blinders?

For example, I see investigative poetry as one form of poetic procedure,
lagpo, webpoetry, visual poetry would be others - it's not the 'what' that's
important but the 'how' and the form of a visual poem might be the way it
looks on the page or the web but for me what matters is how it got there.

As you and I know there is an analogy to the therapeutic process in this.
[By the way I have a copy of Lucy daniels' new bio and i find more of
interest 'poetically' in Winnicott, Milner, etc., than Bolas, for example.]
The 'material' of therapy is obviously of interest as the 'content' but what
is important for me is the way someone 'handles' it - they learn a
'procedure' which helps them deal with itwhile the 'form' of therapy would
be the type or school of therapy?

For example, someone's chilhood issues can be resolved in hundreds of ways
(or not resolved?).  In the sameway the procedural in procedural form would
be the way a poet lerans to massage his or her life or find the words or
pictures to express?

rambling again, i fear.

Barry, I had some thoughts/questions and wanted to reply. I was going
to reply just to you, but then thought there might be at least a
dozen or so people interested in this issue.

I'm wondering about your use of detroit techno. i understand you have
an essay on this, and i'd like to get a copy of it. at one point i
saw a reference to it, but have yet to dig it out -- so i hesitate to
speak out/ask questions about something i might be able to find out
about myself

partly, i'm wondering a couple of things.  one has to do with music,
generally.  what doyou mean by global unconscious, which seems odd to
me.  how is that different from, say, the ability to reference a
sense of the global in certain modernist composers...and then the
word unconscious here seems to invite response as well...while i'm
not a music scholar, i do find this an interesting avenue to pursue.
i'm wondering what is it about detroit techno that makes you say this
most specifically.

do you mean derek may?  When is the detroit electronic music
festival? what do you mean by detroit techno.?

i'll never forget sitting in hamburger mary's in hillcrest with my
parents, trying to explain to them the various genres of "electronic"
or "techno" music. There are probably a half-dozen easy ones to
define and lots of overlap and confusion. When I think of techno, or
say derek may specifically, i think of "house" or dance music --
which is machinic like in its repetitive rhymthic structures -- as
opposed to breakbeat, jungle, etc.etc. again--i'm not an expert and
frankly the "electronica" scene in Tijuana is the only place where
I've confronted the music in a "live" setting -- the Nortec
Collective there (which is now getting international exposure) is an
interesting case study. This community uses digital appropriation
techniqes to blend Norte=F1a makes an interesting gallery scene: part
"rave" (read: party), part gallery scene (as there are often displays
of graphic arts on the walls an in "galleries" adjacent to the
music). meeting often in clubs or -- oddly -- the jai alai building
in downtown tj, this community is not only musicians, but architects,
artists, designers, poets, novelists, and the times i went to those
events, with folks like heriberto yepez or carlos gutierrez vidal and
bibiana padilla, you never saw a more coherent establishment of an
"aesthetic" zone of mixed media, multi media, and etc. A show of
their work at the downtown Contemporary Museum in san diego included
a standing DJ, blue-prints, fashion design, as well as video and more
traditional forms such as graphic design and photography. My point is
that in this moment, to reference "Nortec" -- like Detroit techno --
is to sort of to make claims for regional specificity -- i'm
interested in this regional specficity. The Nortec Collective for me
is exemplary in this sense, since they've taken regional forms of the
border region (especially the norte=F1a music, but also what amounts to
a sort of cowboy iconography common to that region) and then
introduces a sort of 21st century design element. One could trace the
commonalities between this sort of futuristic rave design language --
between the electronic arts community of areas like Tokyo, and
Hamburg and places like that in Germany. The now new york based
musician and writer Momus writes of what he calls the "cute
formalism" of the german electronic community. For example, Mouse on
Mars (a personal favorite of mine) as well as Scratch Pet Land--but
there are many other examples.  Anyhow-- those forms are not
danceable-- though certain Mouse on Mars pieces are very much
so--they're not machinic in quite the same way, in which case more
related, say, to funk. As well,  I'd relate them more explicitly to
the tradition of electronic music which goes back to the tradition of
folks like lejaren hiller and the like -- though I realize that young
people today working in these media have access to all of it, as I
do, sitting right at my computer.

But I'm wondering, aside from the actual digital nature of the
compositions, what makes this different from what other composers
have done now fifty and more years in the past?

relatedly (sort of)
A few years ago I had the opportunity to see Austin Clarkson speak on
Stefan Wolpe, and he linked one of the compositions that Wolpe had
written to a specific meaning or content, in the way that one gets
information about the personal impetus or value of an abstract work
of art for the artist. Wolpe apparently had scribbled a sort of poem
or notes in the margins of one of his compositions (which Clarkson
had seen at the York Univ archives, where the Wolpe papers are
housed). I realize that Clarkson's linking this writing to the
"meaning" of the composition is entirely problematic. There were
other things that came up in that talk, which I'll save--but if there
is interest I will post the lecture (which I think I have on tape
somwhere) on factory school. In any case, the nature of the meaning
of the piece, then, was specifically linked to the camps (I think in
Poland, but it's been more than five years since this lecture). In
any case, we listened to the piece--which I wish I would remember the
name of (any help here anyone?). In any case, what interested me, and
has ever since, is "what is the meaning" of a piece of music. Sure
there is aesthetic pleasure in it -- but then I like a lot of things
that no one else likes and, frankly, i've never seen a movie that I
didn't enjoy, even really so-called bad movies.  A year or so ago, I
taught myself a sort of method for writing music using the computer
and I had a series of revelations. The first was, wow, what an
incredible waste of time -- and what an incredibly important waste of
time. I thought,  it takes a long time to do this -- and what does
this mean? How could one spend his or her entire life doing this?
And HOW could one do this? How? meaning -- How can I get to do this?
It was a fascinating experience, and made me rethink my relation to
poetry, which seemed to occupy a similar place -- it seemed an
incredible luxury, like religious study, or college.

Perhaps all representations are partial-representations; I've often
thought of my 'emanants' such as Nikuko as part-objects, partly present,
partly phantom (as in _limb_), partly obscured. This goes back to the
ding-an-sich in a way, although that might be a re(a)d herring. What's
being investigated is the procurement and inscribing of things...

Re: Ryan - I've been thinking about mu/ma, nothing/interval and their
relationship - their relation to visual contouring (see David Barr,
Vision). We perceive I think by emphasizing (increasing contrast),
circumscribing, inscribing, nomenclature, naming; intervals are defined as
such from the chora (I'm making sense here but perhaps too tired to write
clearly?), what we identify is always already emergent.

Beyond that, beyond the entity or process, there's repose, I'd associate
this with the death drive or the mute- or practico-inert, however one
wants to call it. This is the ability to see Han Shan in the midst of the
red dust, to subtend or read beyond the chaos. -

In relation to the phenomenology of approach, on a practical level, one
learns what to ignore of course; in the midst of the sawgrass prairie, one
might notice a certain depression in the midst of it - this is foreground/
background stuff, so that entanglement and the 'mess' might in fact blank
out as a result of clue, cue, anomaly.

so, i leave in the hinterlands of the hudson valley.
every once in a while i go to nyc and while i'm there
i go and visit st. mark's and pick up some books.
(sorry i just can't get into the shop-on-line)--

so anyhow, i'm sort of on a budget but want to pick up
one (or two) (or three) fabulous new books...but i
(unlike most other times i go down there) don't have
anything specific in mind.

here's your chance to pour food into the unblemished
canvas (that would be me mixing my metaphors)--

no but i'm serious--maybe people can backchannel me
some really good reading suggestions of books of poems
released in the last year or so?

I want to suggest that until the thought process reaches the stage that it
focuses on conflict and becomes anxious or agonistic, in its wandering,
associating pre-articulated stage or stages it is mostly pleasurable; I feel
this is the analogy to aesthetic pleasure, so-called. Names or categories
for this experience are sought; for me the best one is reverie. What is the
material of poetry if not the -musical stream- of thought? But to preserve
and isolate this pleasurable and musical aspect of -verbal- thought is no
small accomplishment; this kind of welding of pleasure to thought-music may
be the foundation of most intellectual concentration, therefore learning and
discovery. Then the distinctions are laboriously brought forth in the later
articulated stages, perhaps still tinged with the earlier pleasures. As is
oft repeated, Freud's ideas about free association were derived from an
essay on aesthetics by F. Schiller, who recommended by-passing critical
thought in order to free writing blocks. Barrett also mentions the issue of
recognition. I think here he is talking about the kind of sorting and
organizing processes involved with following the intertwining streams of
thought that in the most exciting instances lead to memorable or notable
connections, the basis for insights and discoveries. But here the important
aspect is momentum. The critical process is also crucial in evolving this
momentum. Thus the connection between prose and poetry, what Louis Cabri was
talking about in his discussion of the Hausmanization of poetry. But this
issue of momentum brings me back to what I was talking about as -chops- in
Alan Sondheim's work. There is a kind of cascade of thinking that leads to
links, connections, searches, that computer programs try to imitate, but
perhaps music remains the much more powerful analogy. For me Alan Sondheim's
work is virtually always reverie friendly; as is music that does not lead
too insistently, maybe a connection with electronic or techno music there?
Certainly most of Debussy can still do this for me, and much other early
music but also certain 'endless' rock riffs; but not Bach for me, though
some of the most powerful for most music lovers. Tom Bell doesn't seem to
like Christopher Bollas but in his book -the Shadow of the Object- he talks
about a concept he calls the Unthought known, which has to do with inner
experiences of a kind of knowledge that can remain for very long periods of
time unarticulated. He feels- and I agree- that psychoanalysis is sometimes
able to usefully bring such kinds of understanding into an articulated- and
therefore, practically useful, form. In a more recent book-Being a
Character- 1992-Hill and Wang- he tried to connect all this to poetry but
not so successfully, although I'm now less than halfway through this book.

Mr Kazim Ali asks for book suggestions. For something unexpected he might

This poem "for Alan" is fan-fucking-tastic!  Wait, for Alan who- Ginsberg?
Not Sondheim surely.   This reminds me of Howl.  "We are proud to bring you

Here are some suggestions for Kazim:


Charles Bernstein's _With Strings_  (fakelangpo :-) ie fun language poetry
although not all the poems are Language poetry-like

Dean Young's _Skid_   (good, but a quick read)

Albert Goldbarth's _Saving Lives_  (not avant garde but not ordinary either)

Geoffrey Hill _The Orchards of Syon_  (a little incomprehensible and his
other books may be better but this one is recent; I like _The Triumph of
Love_ which
isn't what it sounds like, and _Speech, Speech_ is also good)

Thanks, Aaron.  Yes, for Alan Sondheim!  But Allen Ginsberg [heavenward

I was disappointed that the formatting got screwed up in the posting
process.  It should optimally be viewed in unbroken six-line stanzas, sort
of like a sestina.

        I think the poem is great too, Kasey. But I find it very intriguing how
Alan Sondheim can generate such opposite emotions from our poets. I think
the world of Alan and I hope you do too. But if you hate his work this too
is ok. Its hard to think of another such person for whom this type of effort
applies. Living poets or dead.

I'm just back in town, so I'm not sure how this thread has played out, but
Nick Piombino's recent post on "reverie" is definitely going in my "save"
folder.  Last summer I read Swann's Way for the first time, and now I'm a
couple hundred pages into Within a Budding Grove.  It seems to me that
it's almost impossible to read Proust, to navigate those famously
serpentine sentences, without surrendering to this sort of reverie--an
opening and closing, folding and unfolding of syntax, like watching a
time-lapse film of the life of a flower.  Proust is also quite explicit at
times about the "laborious" work of articulation, a great, indeed heroic
(my word, not his) process always in danger of being interrupted, blocked,
by laziness or distraction.  That "heroism" is very moving to me, perhaps
because I am so often distracted or lazy (a certain kind of laziness that
involves always working, but not necessarily on the right stuff).

I also like very much the idea of the Unthought Known--for me, this is
certainly something that seems central to poetry, or at least to my own
process of writing poetry.  I forget who it was (either Searle or Austen,
i think) who said that the dictionary contains "all the distinctions we
have cared to make."  This is an interesting observation, but also strikes
me as a bit of a lie, since it doesn't sufficiently take into account the
strange--even magical--results of rubbing the words up against one
another.  Certainly *poetry* wants to work to get the most out of this
friction--and is also driven by the desire to penetrate into that weird
"unthought" territory.

Geoffrey,

I think you are misreading the opposition to Alan. I don't think there are
very few people on the list (including myself) who don't think Alan is very
talented and absolutely dedicated and at times (for me) very interesting. The
issue is with the enormous quantity of material he is sending, which I
receive in doubles, in poetic list serve and in imitapoetic. Despite what
Alan said last week (that he withholds half of his material), his writing
appears to me completely unedited, almost always continuing more than it
should (containing an assumption that the writer's mind/consciousness is one
with the reader's, which isn't).

Of course, Alan is free to and should do what he wants. I think there is a
second, deeper issue affecting the strong, contradictory responses to his
work. In a poetry which embodies process (the word used in this list is
procedure), is editing possible -doesn't editing interfere with the initial
givens (in Alan's case some kind of computer code language beyond my
understanding) of a process? If so, is editing then a kind of tabu, a
reintroduction of the personality/person which the procedure is trying to
escape?

My answer is that every system (from surrealists to Jackson maclow) cheats,
edits; in fact, those "cheatings" (the complulsion, necessity to cheat) are
what make a work interesting. Does that make the escape from the person (the
human, the individual mind, whatever you want to call it) finally impossible,
essentially a working hypothesis illusion to open new ways? I think so.

Alan has no theoretical objection to editing (he says he keeps half of what
he writes out). In this case, the main affect of his writing, on me, is
compulsion. Not that he wants to write, but he can not keep himself from
writing. It is this element of compulsion which makes it hard for me to
approach his text. Usually, i give a quick glance, to see if the piece has
snagged something; if no combination of words capture my attention, I let it
go.

I don't know if my reactions resonate with anybody else's on the list. I
don't believe even the greatest admirer of Alan thinks everything he writes
is of equal interest. Then the question remains: how much white space (noise)
is tolerated in a procedural work. Of course, white space/noise is integral
to such work. But is there a limit within which this noise/space may exist or
is its presence absolute and limitless?

====================================================================
Hostilities are increasing in the world at a frightening pace, and theatres
of conflict are springing up everywhere.  Our own continent is suddenly
vulnerable to devastating attacks, while within our own borders old and new
hatreds are  surfacing and parnoia is becoming legislation.  People across
the world are fearing for the safety of themselves and their families.  In
this climate of fear many people see military escalation as inevitable.
     Now, more than ever, we need creative minds to see other
possibilities, to unravel and question the complex feelings of many sides
in play, and to be communicators in a world needy for dialogue. Along with
the announcements and vexations of news politicians, guerrillas and evening
news pundits, we need the voices of thinkers, of writers, of poets.
    The coming event precedes a national gathering in Ottawa to oppose the
war set for June 26 and 27. Poets for Peace will be one of the
participating groups.

Alan's work doesn't seem 'procedural' in the narrow sense that
implies a single or self-contained mathematical/'mechanical' procedure --
which tends to a formalist dead-end when pursued _as such_: beyond that
there are procedures, routines, citations, institutions, etc, in every
kind of writing and reading.

It seems odd to think of the surrealists/Mac Low here. The insistence is
rather on layers of procedures, protocols, editings, integrations and
disintegrations, exhaustion, sexualities, the internet etc.. And there's a
great deal of intertextuality/continuity that takes the work out of the
realm of merely 'procedural' -- look at the avatars, the resonances with
the video/music/photos etc -- all of which implies at the level of the
text, in spite of your pathetic-fallacy reading, complex, involved and
careful editing.

This is incredibly short notice, but is anyone interested in going to the
marathon Ulysses celebration at Symphony Space in NYC tomorrow?  It
traditionally ends with a full dramatic reading of Molly Bloom's soliloquy
at the end of the book, read by a really good actress.  I can't seem to get
the actual schedule for the even online this years, but the announcement is
at http://www.symphonyspace.org/genres/seriesPage.php?genreId=4&seriesId=18
This is truncated from previous years-- it used to be from noon to midnight
and you'd walk in and out, but now it is 7pm to midnight (I hope you can
still walk in and out because that is still very long!).  But the end is
worth hearing and I only went to the beginning before.  (It also used to be
free, I think, and now it is pretty expensive...)  I wonder if you can get
in for less at the time if they haven't sold all the tickets...

Before I go I'd like to announce this summer's Instance Press =
publication:

TRUE NEWS by Craig Watson, 80 pages, ISBN 0-9679854-2-0 (10 bucks)

Ted Pearson writes:

In _Free Will_, Watson's previous book, the final curtain falls on "an
opera of unrepentant days." In the darkened theater of ideology's =
"simple
grammar and private perjuries," it is the burden and singular =
achievement
of his new work to "divide the crisis we cultivate from the crisis we
advertise and thereby know when to worship the dead and when to eat =
them."
Here, now, and for the foreseeable future, _True News_ is essential =
reading.

 >>>i'll never forget sitting in hamburger mary's in hillcrest with my
parents, trying to explain to them the various genres of "electronic"

define and lots of overlap and confusion. When I think of techno, or
say derek may specifically, i think of "house" or dance music --
which is machinic like in its repetitive rhymthic structures -- as
opposed to breakbeat, jungle, etc.etc. again--i'm not an expert and
frankly the "electronica" scene in Tijuana is the only place where
I've confronted the music in a "live" setting -- the Nortec
Collective there (which is now getting international exposure) is an
interesting case study. This community uses digital appropriation
techniqes to blend Norte=F1a makes an interesting gallery scene: part
"rave" (read: party), part gallery scene (as there are often displays
of graphic arts on the walls an in "galleries" adjacent to the
music). meeting often in clubs or -- oddly -- the jai alai building
in downtown tj, this community is not only musicians, but architects,
artists, designers, poets, novelists, and the times i went to those
events, with folks like heriberto yepez or carlos gutierrez vidal and
bibiana padilla, you never saw a more coherent establishment of an
"aesthetic" zone of mixed media, multi media, and etc. A show of
their work at the downtown Contemporary Museum in san diego included
a standing DJ, blue-prints, fashion design, as well as video and more
traditional forms such as graphic design and photography. My point is
that in this moment, to reference "Nortec" -- like Detroit techno --
is to sort of to make claims for regional specificity -- i'm
interested in this regional specficity. The Nortec Collective for me
is exemplary in this sense, since they've taken regional forms of the
border region (especially the norte=F1a music, but also what amounts to
a sort of cowboy iconography common to that region) and then
introduces a sort of 21st century design element. One could trace the
commonalities between this sort of futuristic rave design language --
between the electronic arts community of areas like Tokyo, and
Hamburg and places like that in Germany.

I'm interested in this "border electronica" you describe.

 >>>The now new york based
musician and writer Momus writes of what he calls the "cute
formalism" of the german electronic community. For example, Mouse on
Mars (a personal favorite of mine) as well as Scratch Pet Land--but
there are many other examples.  Anyhow-- those forms are not
danceable-- though certain Mouse on Mars pieces are very much
so--they're not machinic in quite the same way, in which case more
related, say, to funk. As well,  I'd relate them more explicitly to
the tradition of electronic music which goes back to the tradition of
folks like lejaren hiller and the like -- though I realize that young
people today working in these media have access to all of it, as I
do, sitting right at my computer.

There are a lot of age-fascists out there, with proprietary claims to their=
=20
taste.

 >>>But I'm wondering, aside from the actual digital nature of the
compositions, what makes this different from what other composers
have done now fifty and more years in the past?

A lot of discussion about art gets hung up on description, as if that's the=
=20
key to what it is. Describe in fifty words or less the differences between=
=20
House and Techno, for instance. When the point is more that there are=20
somewhat different operating principles or shared assumptions between these=
=20
genres. How is a genre productive? In other words, once a genre defines its=
=20
stylistic limits, it still has to annex new meaning and continue to=20
"reproduce" itself. Techno is highly reproductive; it feeds on a certain=20
repertoire of music, and interprets itself in terms of its sources. It is=20
not simply dance music, of course. There's an interesting relation between=
=20
"knowing" the sources and codes and then suspending them in the effect, in=
=20
a kind trancelike non-knowing.

 >>>relatedly (sort of)
A few years ago I had the opportunity to see Austin Clarkson speak on
Stefan Wolpe, and he linked one of the compositions that Wolpe had
written to a specific meaning or content, in the way that one gets
information about the personal impetus or value of an abstract work
of art for the artist. Wolpe apparently had scribbled a sort of poem
or notes in the margins of one of his compositions (which Clarkson
had seen at the York Univ archives, where the Wolpe papers are
housed). I realize that Clarkson's linking this writing to the
"meaning" of the composition is entirely problematic. There were
other things that came up in that talk, which I'll save--but if there
is interest I will post the lecture (which I think I have on tape
somwhere) on factory school. In any case, the nature of the meaning
of the piece, then, was specifically linked to the camps (I think in
Poland, but it's been more than five years since this lecture). In
any case, we listened to the piece--which I wish I would remember the
name of (any help here anyone?). In any case, what interested me, and
has ever since, is "what is the meaning" of a piece of music. Sure
there is aesthetic pleasure in it -- but then I like a lot of things
that no one else likes and, frankly, i've never seen a movie that I
didn't enjoy, even really so-called bad movies.  A year or so ago, I
taught myself a sort of method for writing music using the computer
and I had a series of revelations. The first was, wow, what an
incredible waste of time -- and what an incredibly important waste of
time. I thought,  it takes a long time to do this -- and what does
this mean? How could one spend his or her entire life doing this?
And HOW could one do this? How? meaning -- How can I get to do this?
It was a fascinating experience, and made me rethink my relation to
poetry, which seemed to occupy a similar place -- it seemed an
incredible luxury, like religious study, or college.

Never seeing a movie one doesn't like seems like a kind of limit experience=
=20
in terms of aesthetics. And then there's always seeing what confirms "me=20
and my destiny," my personal set of sources and codes.

Is Jack Spicer a fake poet?  There is something subtly (or not so subtly)
bogus about him, as if he were some extremely talented poet's joke...  Or am
I just obsessed with fakeness?

Speaking of which, I showed my father (not a modern poetry person AT ALL,
but he likes literature that is pre 20th C) Bernstein's _With Strings_ (or
maybe it was McCaffery's _The Cheat of Words_) and he said "this can't be
serious" and I wondered if he was right at some level...I mean, it's funny
and supposed to be funny, but my father's immediate reaction was that it
couldn't be taken seriously as poetry-- yet for me it seemed perfectly
believable as serious poetry, because I've read what happened in between the
19th C and the 21st and my father hasn't.  But it's always interesting what
a truly naive person will say.

jack is never a joke he's the man who said:

       The ocean, humilaiting in its disguises.
       Tougher than anything.
       No one listens to poetry. The ocean
       doesnt mean to be listened to. A drop
       Or crash of water. It means
       Nothing.
       It
       Is bread and butter
       Pepper and salt. The death
       that young men hope for. Aimlessly
       It pounds the shore. White and aimless signals. No
       One listens to poetry."

  If I'm not wrong this poem is a favourite of Ron Silliman's: anycase
Creeley and all those guys know  about Spicer...But Spicer isn't being a
nihilist here; note the way the poem "shifts" and the deceptive subtlety:
he's bardic and romantic but also in his own way a revolutionary: he lived
and died by and for The Word and booze and maybe love. Probably love but
ceratinly the word energised. Richard Taylor

This poem is nice,it reminds me of a swindburne poem
I read some time ago, about the dynamism of the sea.
It is simple yet complex and contains a certain melancholy.

Swinburne is a great poet whose ability to note detail - especailly of the
sea - as he was a great swimmer and out doors person (despite that he was
also somwhat obsessed with "flogging" and matters strange and historical: I
dont think he was gay per se...maybe he was...). He was also a champion of
Victor Hugo (who knew of him) and Baudelaire, a major force then and still
now: by coincidence in a poem series I took a whole lot of words (endings)
from a Swinburne poem and placed them into one 'block" of a collagy or
"statement-response" poem called "Chains". Then I dscovered that John
Ahsbery had aslo put some  at the ends of his "Flow Chart" (lines of) which
is a (roughly ) 300 page poem book.
  Jean Overton Fuller writes a good  bio of Swinburne: despite his
reputation as a mellifluous spouter he was no mean tech and also she points
out his acute eye (rivalling that of Gerald Manley Hopkins) of the natural
world...he also is concerned with sound and 'music' but another thing is his
interest in history and eg Queen Anne (the Scottish Queen who ran foul of
Elizabeth). Critics are divided re Swinburne. Berstein talks about him in "A
Poetics" which is really worth a read.
  That "all 'a' " poem of yours must have given you a headache Tony. Its
interesting: certainly it challenges.
  Plenty on the list could tell you about Jack Spicer: he did some brilliant
poems...made a point of  pointing out all the editors (eg Levertov) who
didnt publish him!! So he published himself. Liked his booze a bit much but
a majorly significant artist. Richard.

Even more challenging, Tony, would be a text of this length using
only the /a/ sound, rather than just sticking to the letter (<a>).

I enjoyed this piece very much as a tribute to Alan, as poetics, as poetry,
as prose, as critique. A truly boundary breaking work. Well done, K.Silem

You used 21 other letters in the alphabet and a bunch of punctuation.  Not =
to mention that you use numbers in the story, wich if you are going to make=
 the distinction of using only the 'a' vowel, it fails by using 5,000 which=
 employs a long 'i' and a short 'ou'.  An engaging text that only used 'a' =
would truly be amazing.

Right. It's a stream-of-consciousness monologue about sex, kinda
Molly-Bloomish but nonverbal. However, it signifies through, etc.

What exactly is the difference between "procedural" and "procedural in the
narrow sense." I was essentially referring to language Alan uses to describe
his work. I never said or assumed that procedure implies necessarily
formalism. In alan's case, it sure doesn't.

Once again, who said that poetry coming out of "procedures" can not have
resonance? Maybe you think so when you say "merely procedural."

-- all of which implies at the level of the

I remember, pathetic fallacy was one of the no-nos, taboos of poetic
criticism (in college, when in my time new criticism was dominant). I learnt
how to dispense with these imaginary distinctions, which essentially are
self-interested bans -by the established authority- on the freedom of reading.

Thanks for the response.

Aside from a few breaches of your own rule (the y in many is a vowel, all
of rthe numbers are cheating because they contain spoken vowels other than
a, so are many of the abbreviations and acronyms--P. Sampras, DNA,  F18,
etc. And you use strata, the plural, as singular, to avoid stratum, which
is the singular), I had a hard time staying awake through the whole thing.
One never wonders about the purpose of an exercise unless it puts one to sleep.

I don't have a book of Spicer so can't respond properly, but some poems
seemed like parodies of well-known poets' styles.  That's why I asked...
Perhaps at certain time everyone was writing in a partcular way and what to
me seemed like imitation was in fact just one equal expression of the
zeitgeist, and the poets I knew better could equally be seen as imitating
Spicer.  But since I am bookless, I can't give an example...  I have almost
bought the complete Jack Spicer several times but  always almost and never
actually...

I went to the bookstore (Lbyrinth for those of you from NYC) and bought some
bargain books and picked up William Matthews Last Poems which is
old-fashioned but surprisingly entetaining.  He manages to say things in
orgdinary language that aren't sentimental or drearily predictable like so
much free verse that eschews modernism and later techniques.  I also got
Midnight Salvage by Adrienne Rich -- she's never been a favorite of mine.  I
bought the book because it ws harbback, new, and $3.98, and contins the the
lines

        You cannot eat and egg  You don't know where it's been
        even the ordinary body of the hen
        vouchsafes no safety  the countryside refuses to supply
        Milk is powdered.  meats's in both senses high

which drew me somehow.

Earlier I bought an Amy Clampitt book on the street, which probably is
sentimental, but it contained some good poems about depression, in which I
have a personal and professional interest (I teach poetry workshops to
mental health consumers, and I try to collect poems abnout mental illness to
have them read, especially ones not by anne sexton or sylvia plath, ie ones
they won't know already....  If anyone know any good examples, please let me
know.  I already know about Jane Kenyon's "Having it Out with Melancholy,"
everything by Lowell (because Lowell was an interest of mine), Ginsberg's
Kaddish, etc., along with some little known contemporary things.

I also collect poems which sound mentally ill (like psychosis or mania)
without being about mental illness-- for instance many of James Tate's early
poems are paranoid or otherwise psychotic sounding.  It's great to see what
to us seems like both a problem AND a way of thinking that is natural and
"right" for us, but considered to be "sick" into an art form that can win
the Pulitzeer.  (Psychotic or manic rambling is natural for us and it
doesn't always involve being actually ill -- one can have a psychotic style
of thinking without clinical psychosis; I think it would be called a formal
thought disorder but I sometimes reject that terminology of the person is
not disabled by the mode of thinking:  I'm talking about derailment,
concreteness, and it's opposite, attaching meaning to everything whether it
has meaning or not (something often done in poetry), personalizing the
impersonal="ideas or reference, free associating, etc.).  Plus I can do this
deliberately if I am in an elevated mood but one that is far too mildly
elevated to actually cause me to think that way for real. And there is a
particular sense of humar attached to having had the experience of mania
which extends to periods when one isn't manic.  People accused me of being
manic with regard to fakelangpo, and I WAS pursuing a manic joke style, but
I wasn't actually manic.

I read that it takes Tate three hours sometimes to come up with each line.
This surprised me & my friends because if we were rambling on like that, the
thought process would be amost instantaneous-- in fact the problem would be
to slow down enough to write down all the steps so that the ramble would
appear to be self connectd at all-- with tangential thinking, each thought
follows from the previous one, but not necessarily from the one before that,
and if you leave something out you get total nonsense rather than connected
nonsense.  The problem is that most psychotic rambling is not as funny or
interesting as Tate's poems (not surprisingly) although it can be
entertaining if you are not upset that the person you are talking to is
losing it.  For example, I was walking my ex to the local looney bin once,
and I got close to him and he started saying "get away from me , you
vegetable!" and I ascertained that he thought I was a pumpkin, so I said
"Pumkins can't talk" and he said "you're a talking pumpkin.  I can't help
that, can I"  And then I said , "But pumpkins are completely round and don't
have legs" and he said "you're a very exceptional pumpkin"  And I said "Do I
have a green stem at the top of me: pumpkins have stems."  And he said
"you're a really funny lookingh pumpkin.  Maybe you are rotten iinside.
because you have this brown fibrous stuff coming out all over where the stem
belongs" etc.  And this would have been really funny had I not been upset
that my boyfriend thought I was a pumpkin.  I always used to think he was
joking about stuff like that, but he never was.  And yet it had to be
connected to some primal humor center because he would invariably come up
with funnny delusions or funny ways of talking about them only he didn't get
the joke.

Anyway if people have examples of this I'd be glad to see them, too.  There
are some in Berryman's Dream Songs (but he was likely clinically manic at
times during tha writing) but I find DS almost unreadable because of the
spelled out "Black dialect" which aged very poorly.  Berryman's sonnets are
nonsense or nonsense seeming, some of them, but I don't think of them as
mental illness-like-- just sort of muddy writing.  On the other hand, some
of his sonnets are really good...

jack is never a joke he's the man who said:

       The ocean, humilaiting in its disguises.
       Tougher than anything.
       No one listens to poetry. The ocean
       doesnt mean to be listened to. A drop
       Or crash of water. It means
       Nothing.
       It
       Is bread and butter
       Pepper and salt. The death
       that young men hope for. Aimlessly
       It pounds the shore. White and aimless signals. No
       One listens to poetry."

  If I'm not wrong this poem is a favourite of Ron Silliman's: anycase
Creeley and all those guys know  about Spicer...But Spicer isn't being a
nihilist here; note the way the poem "shifts" and the deceptive subtlety:
he's bardic and romantic but also in his own way a revolutionary: he lived
and died by and for The Word and booze and maybe love. Probably love but
ceratinly the word energised. Richard Taylor

June Jordan of Berkeley, an award-winning poet and UC Berkeley professor
who became one of the country's most prominent contemporary black women
writers, died Friday.

Ms. Jordan died at her home after a nearly decadelong fight with breast
cancer. She was 65.

Best known for her powerful and direct poems articulating struggles
against racism, Ms. Jordan was a prolific author in many genres. She
published 28 books of poems, political essays and children's fiction.

She also wrote a regular column for The Progressive, and wrote the
libretto to the opera, 'I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the
Sky," directed by Peter Sellars with music by John Adams.

Her career was once summed up by author and Nobel laureate Toni Morrison
as:

"Forty years of tireless activism coupled with and fueled by flawless
art."

Poet and friend Adrienne Rich said Ms. Jordan was endowed with a rare
gift for using words with "elegance and precision."

"She had an extraordinary sense of language, and a very embracing sense
of language," Rich said. "I believe she felt that she should use it
wherever it was called for."

Ms. Jordan, who described herself as a "black radical," often said that
writing poetry was a political act. And critics noted that her work
skillfully captured moments where personal life and political struggle
intertwine.

One oft-anthologized piece of hers, "Poem About My Rights," revealed her
rage at racial discrimination:

@poet "We are the wrong people of

the wrong skin on the wrong continent. . . .

I am not wrong: Wrong is not my name

My name is my own my own my own

and I can't tell you who the hell set things up like this

but I can tell you that from now on my resistance

my simple and daily and nightly self-determination

may very well cost you your life."

This poem, she told The Chronicle in 1999, "brings you to a place of
defiance that is completely serious . . . my nightly self-determination
may very well cost you your life."

An activist in the progressive and civil rights movements, Ms. Jordan
also spent a lifetime teaching and inspiring young people to write.

In 1990, a year after she joined the faculty of UC Berkeley's African
American Studies Department, she founded "Poetry for the People," a
popular undergraduate program that blends the study of poetry with
political empowerment.

"I'm just trying to spawn as many poets as possible," she told The
Chronicle in 1999.

Born in Harlem on July 9, 1936, Ms. Jordan was the child of West Indian
immigrant parents. Her future was shaped, for better and for worse, by
her relationship with a father who projected his ambitions onto her.

She described her childhood in her 1999 memoir, "Soldier: A Poet's
Childhood."

Subjected to beatings by her father, Ms. Jordan was forced to read and
recite from Shakespeare's plays, the Bible, and the poetry of Paul
Lawrence Dunbar and Edgar Allan Poe -- all before she was 5 years old. By
the time she was 7, she was writing poems herself.

In 1953, she entered Barnard College, where she met Michael Meyer, a
white student. The two married in 1955, and had a son, Christopher, in
1958. The couple divorced in 1965.

From 1967 to 1978, she taught English at the City College of New York,
Yale University, Sarah Lawrence College and Connecticut College. From
1978 to 1989 she taught at the State University of New York at Stony
Brook, before coming to UC Berkeley.

Among other awards, she received a Rockefeller Grant for Creative Writing
and special congressional recognition for her writing and work in the
progressive and civil rights movements.  >>

Why has the pun become so ubiquitous a device among poets who locate
themselves within an experimental tradition?

Yes, there's the example of Finnegan's Wake.  But as a contemporary form of
comedy, the pun is hopelessly corny and out of date, bringing to mind the
televised yucksters of the Eisenhower years, their gags and one-liners.
Very square stuff, if not ghoulish: Bob Hope in Vietnam, etc.  The geniuses
of contemporary humor--Bernie Mac, for example--use language in very
different ways.  So the pun would seem to live only in experimental poetry.
Maybe we can attribute this to a desire among younger poets to imitate
Charles Bernstein, even thought they lack his half-embarrassed awareness of
their 50s-style schmaltziness.

Louis Cabri is a punster as well, though in his writing the pun has a
different emotional valence, more aggressive than sociable.  Here is "Clone
Jacking" (included in The Mood Embosser):

http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~moriarty/cabri.htm

The aggression comes across in the strained willfulness of the punning and
the somewhat brutal insistence that the reader be made not just to hear,
but to see the homonyms.  He does this two ways: with pointedly crude line
breaks ("head on screen / saver it," "WE HAVE DOO / DLE") and creative
misspellings ("con / ducked er," "X / pensive," "fang club").  Puns require
a listener who is ready and able to perceive the double meaning.  Cabri,
though, will not allow his jokes to be missed.  He is going to make sure
that he's given credit for each witticism.  This is in-your-face punning.

I don't know how self-conscious the poet is about this, or what he means
really when he says "pun / drippings coat / tongues" (which could be a
self-critical admission -- i.e., puns are grease -- maybe even schmaltz
[goose fat]).  But it does seem clear that the aggression of the style is
connected to the poem's dominant mood: disgust and boredom directed at
various familiar targets, such as advertising ("New!"), violence done to
nature by consumption ("his / 'n' hers furs"), and the ideological sameness
of contemporary politics (I interpret "Red Left / for Right" as another
pun: _read_ left for right).

In this poem then, punning is fundamentally an expression of anger, perhaps
even of anger at the reader.

Puns are polysemic--polyseismic .  They ain't the devil but often people seem
bedeviled by them. The stiffs do, anywho. Puns show the way words splay along
faultlines of denotation, connotation and fumbling desire.  They're little
temblors.  I love 'em.

some thoughts:

Puns also offer the insides of language.  what is read is different than
what is understood.  in that space several things are possible (to occur):
we see the ability of language to mislead (holbrook); the capitalist
occupation of the informative sentence is raised/razed when sense is
generated by a negation of operative efficiency; puns discover that the
inside of reference is a vacuum, a black hole.  not so much a dillemma, more
a diffuse effect.  something other than expected is not enviable when buying
tennis shoes, grocery shopping, or attempting to program a vcr.  puns are
effective and also widely utilized because they inject an element of play
into the value-ethic of language.  you don't get what you pay for.  play is
a waste of time.  time is money.  play becomes a subversive act.  puns play
"very seriously".  palindromes and anagrams et al. effect the same challenge
to the value of language. they challenge the status of the event in language
by negating the process of linear accumulation that accompanies a well
constructed sentence, by literally turning the process back on itself.

Poem with puns:


Misreadings

busy-ness suits only the man in suits
who suits himself with stocks and opt-
shuns the children leaves
that to wife
mean Fall for him is a dissent
(in value not
a drop of leaves
and a cool breeze
most unnacceptable in wives
and offspring
who must obey the market forces
that bind him


....but this was just an experiment with a form that allows for reading in
two different frames.  I am not sure the technique can actually be used in a
real, longer poem, except just for a couple of lines...

Subject: Close reading: Cabri, "Clone Jacking"


Why has the pun become so ubiquitous a device among poets who locate
themselves within an experimental tradition?

Yes, there's the example of Finnegan's Wake.  But as a contemporary form of
comedy, the pun is hopelessly corny and out of date, bringing to mind the
televised yucksters of the Eisenhower years, their gags and one-liners.
Very square stuff, if not ghoulish: Bob Hope in Vietnam, etc.  The geniuses
of contemporary humor--Bernie Mac, for example--use language in very
different ways.  So the pun would seem to live only in experimental poetry.
Maybe we can attribute this to a desire among younger poets to imitate
Charles Bernstein, even thought they lack his half-embarrassed awareness of
their 50s-style schmaltziness.

Louis Cabri is a punster as well, though in his writing the pun has a
different emotional valence, more aggressive than sociable.  Here is "Clone
Jacking" (included in The Mood Embosser):

http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~moriarty/cabri.htm

The aggression comes across in the strained willfulness of the punning and
the somewhat brutal insistence that the reader be made not just to hear,
but to see the homonyms.  He does this two ways: with pointedly crude line
breaks ("head on screen / saver it," "WE HAVE DOO / DLE") and creative
misspellings ("con / ducked er," "X / pensive," "fang club").  Puns require
a listener who is ready and able to perceive the double meaning.  Cabri,
though, will not allow his jokes to be missed.  He is going to make sure
that he's given credit for each witticism.  This is in-your-face punning.

I don't know how self-conscious the poet is about this, or what he means
really when he says "pun / drippings coat / tongues" (which could be a
self-critical admission -- i.e., puns are grease -- maybe even schmaltz
[goose fat]).  But it does seem clear that the aggression of the style is
connected to the poem's dominant mood: disgust and boredom directed at
various familiar targets, such as advertising ("New!"), violence done to
nature by consumption ("his / 'n' hers furs"), and the ideological sameness
of contemporary politics (I interpret "Red Left / for Right" as another
pun: _read_ left for right).

In this poem then, punning is fundamentally an expression of anger, perhaps
even of anger at the reader.

On the contrary: I am not wrong at all; you claimed to use "only the
vowel a." In the first line alone I spot the consonant t, the
consonant M, the consonant t again, and so on.

obviously it is worthless to write something like aaa aa aaaa aa,
what I was saying is all other vowels were missing ie.no 0,e,i,u etc and
only the vowel 'a' is used,sorry for stating it wrong originally.
the point is this type of writing is new territory in most literary circles
and has not been
explored fully.I hope other writers catch on.

Perec's La Disparition came out in 69...read Raymond Queneau's essay
"Potential Literature" in _Oulipo_, ed. Warren Motte, for some historical
mentions...

According to Queneau:

"Nestor of Laranda, in the third or fourth century, wrote a lipogrammatic
Iliad: the letter A is absent from the first canto, etc....Pindar wrote an
ode without the S, and Lope de Vega wrote five stories one without the A,
the others without E, I, O, and U, respectively."

the one thing i can think of is that the word itself
is the moment when the "word" and "signified" lose
focus and shift into the other thing. it's "funny" but
also dramatic and "traumatic" to lose the expected
meaning and create the new association.

in that sense much of Susan Howe's work (etymological
sourcing on alternate meanings..."Emily" from
teutonic, etc. in My ED; meanings of "Mark" etc etc)
is a sophisticated form of punning.

one time i read a poem that used "landbridge" and
"language" interchangeably when narrating the
pilgrimage of nations from asia to america. does that
count as a pun?

i thought his "fake" translations of lorca (complete
with fake preface by the man (long dead at that point,
i believe) himself would count here.

it reminded me of ted berrigan's "fake" interview with
John Cage (is that right?)

but he wasn't fake in the sense you mean. i mean he
was real.

but regarding your father and the "real naif" i don't
completely agree with you--i read some rosmarie
waldrop poems to friends in the bathroom at a rave
(yeah really) and they went bananas for it...my
freshmen composition class devoured (responded
intelligently in their essays) selections I gave them
from Susan Howe, Adeena Karasick, Michael Palmer, and
Edmond Jabes--

younger people (i mean even younger than me) i think
have much more facile understanding of intertextual,
hypertextual, and extra-textual work. it seemed
perfectly natural to them to read the "danish
notebook"--they didn't *see* that it had no
conventional organization. they *liked* it's
tasseographic organization--ditto for the lines of NC
Memorial that are comprised solely of verbs, ("came
saw went running told") etc.

Hey:

Here's a report on about.com that I wrote about a poetry and performance
event that happened a while ago at the Educational Alliance in NYC.

It was called SPEECH ACTS and was curated by Matvei Yankelevich
featuring works by myself, Todd Colby, Marianne Vitale and Michael
Portnoy (Yogurt Boys), Edwin Torres, Bill Luoma, David Shapiro, Filip
Marinovic, Eugene Ostashevsky, Marc Sloan, Joel Schlemowitz, Nancy Cohen

Thank you. I'm away in Vermont, and I haven't seen one, yet. I just
searched the NYT website, and I found nothing.
I'll look on the LAT website.

Appreciatively.

Ryan wrote somewhere on these threads:
"Alan's work doesn't seem 'procedural' in the narrow sense that
implies a single or self-contained mathematical/'mechanical' procedure --"

I think there is a tendency for many to read procedural, research. etc., somewhat myoptically and focus anti-scientifically as good humanist do on the smell of science and forget the scientist who is proceeding or researching..  I think the mention of MacLow in Ryan's pos puts the conversation here on these offshhooting threads into the realm of the reverie Nick brings up along with play in an action sense.  [Nick - I didn't intend to put Bollas down, only to suggest that Winnicott and others had more relence to play.

-not intending to single out Ryan in any way here-

put together some of these currents as they relate to investigative poetry at: http://www.metaphormetonym.com/notes.htm

>
Investigative Notes on


Investigative Poetry




Start perhaps with Ed Sanders, perhaps, the poet.

Add some process or procedural action. David Antin is a good starting point here, especially the 'Interview with David Antin' that Charles Bernstein did via email (Review of Contemporary Fiction, Spring, 2001, Vol. XXI, No. 1). Harryette Mullen is another starting point and Daniel Kane's interview is a good takeoff point (http://www.writenet.org/poetschat/poetschat_h_mullen.html).

A search of the archives of POETICS should give you some leads

Another important element in the mix is play in the action sense rather merely play as following the rules of a game. Oulipo and langpo and other procedural roots figure in here but not the procedures themselves as much as the interaction with them. Fields of Play was an early collaborative piece in this vein.

Reverie is perhaps where we start


And end?

alanophiles and misalanists alike:

if you have a hard time reading alan's writings as they are posted, let
me suggest something i've done in the past which is to save them as they
come in and then reading them all at once later. (you could do the same
thing by searching the list archives for his email address and for, say,
a month's stretch of time.) i've found this to create an intriguing
cumulative kind of effect that encourages an absorption into his texts
as they move and develop over the given period of time, something that's
not quite discernable in the short/frequent bursts as posted.

bests,
tom orange

Perhaps what Ryan meant is that there are two modes (maybe) of procedural
work - one in which the procedure is input/output or straightforward
output:
a. input => [procedure/filter] => output
b. [procedure/lexicon/filter] => output
and one in which there is a tangled holarchic skein of procedures,
filters, reworkings, catalyst-programs, and so forth. My work is of the
second; it doesn't sit well with idealized mathesis. To this extent if
anything, it's a dirty or shameful procedure, binding the very ties that
open the text elsewhere - Alan

Friday, June 14, 2002 (AP)
Poet, professor, activist June Jordan dies

    (06-14) 16:19 PDT BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) --

    Poet, activist and University of California, Berkeley professor June
Jordan died Friday morning here.
    She was 65 and had struggled against breast cancer for several years.
    Born in Harlem, Jordan began writing poetry early in life and became
involved in the civil rights movement while a student at Barnard College.
    Jordan published 26 books of poetry, political essays and children's
fiction. Her memoir, "Soldier, A Poet's Childhood," was published in 1999.
    In a statement issued when that memoir was published, Nobel laureate
Toni
Morrison praised Jordan's "40 years of activism fueled by flawless art."
    Jordan also wrote the libretto to the opera, "I Was Looking at the
Ceiling
and Then I Saw the Sky," directed by Peter Sellars with music by John
Adams. She also had several poems set to music.
    Jordan was a professor of African American Studies at Berkeley, where
she
began teaching in 1989. She previously taught at Yale University, Sarah
Lawrence College and the State University of New York, Stony Brook.
    She received a Rockefeller Grant for Creative Writing and special
congressional recognition for her writing and work in the progressive and
civil rights movements.

Subject:      Close reading: Wolff, "Lamb,
              Willow: An Arch Dolefulness Has Taken Me this Far"
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

The works of a number of younger poets, especially post-MFA poets, reflect
a desire to get out of the workshop mode.  Ethically and aesthetically, the
problem is to avoid giving the impression that your personal experience is
inherently poignant--without giving up on personal experience as such.  So
you obscure the relation between your work and your life.

The poems in Rebecca Wolff's first book Manderley seem to fall in this
camp, and while I don't think she has yet figured out how to make the best
use of her strengths, some of the writing is quite memorable.  She too
works by ironizing the relationship between herself and her texts (with one
or two _major_ exceptions).  Most of her poems say, at some level, "Any
resemblance to my real life is coincidental."  Often this job is given to
the opening line, which, by being rather acidly ironic, serves as a kind of
self-indemnification for everything that follows: "These fakirs really know
how to eat," "Beginning with a fantasy of abuse."  If you begin like that,
you inoculate yourself against the charge of straining for lyric
sensitivity.  "Pathos," she says, "is the domain of the rhetorician."  So
instead she keeps things ironic, even campy: "I've been / wearing a lot /
of white lately" etc.  Some statements veer close to pathos, but even these
get a deflating pinprick: "we / kiss and kiss until the kiss / falls
meaningless."  This kind of writing may try to charm the reader, but it
keeps its defenses up.

I think this more recent (?) poem by Wolff, "Lamb, Willow: An Arch
Dolefulness Has Taken Me this Far," while still incredibly armored (and
horribly titled), is nonetheless skillful, partly because it does actually
try to grapple with personal experience:

http://www.morningred.com/friend/2001/03/bone.html  (scroll down a bit)

This poem is obscure, but I read it as being at least in part about the
limits of Wolff's style to date.  It seems clear that it's set in a crypt.
The title may refer to the poet's own "arch dolefulness," whereas "this
far" may refer to the tomb or to her present condition in life (thinking
about tombs).  She seems therefore to be asking: How far will an arch style
take you when dealing with ultimate questions of life?  She writes: "Once
more I am in the right place but with the wrong feelings."  The "feelings"
seem to be skeptical ones, and thus "wrong" given the solemnity and mystery
of the situation (although no tourist, it is implied, could really feel
_right_ here).  The poet's self-consciousness is mature, a product of time
and thus in touch with mortality, unlike the "deep pathos of the infant
cosmology" (religion? a child's point of view?).  At the end of the poem,
her tone becomes more doleful, for she acknowledges that being "rinsed
clean" somehow "hardly matters," for she is still stuck "in the middle of
fucking nowhere," between "camp and derangement."  If she becomes more
"song-like" it's because of the loss of anyplace to stand, however
"figmented."  I wonder if Wolff will become more song-like or less.

Ah. I think I know what has happened. What you think you were saying
is that the only vowel used was the vowel "a"; but what you said was
that "only the vowel "a" is used.

Thank you. I'm away in Vermont, and I haven't seen one, yet. I just
searched the NYT website, and I found nothing.
I'll look on the LAT website.

Appreciatively.

Subject:      Re: a brief hystery of the pun
MIME-Version: 1.0

To pun, especially to pun abundantly, is an anti-imperialist act with a
long tradition. A genealogy of the pun reveals its politicization,
feminization, and demonization in Western Europe beginning with the
nation building projects  of the seventeenth century.

During the Middle-English period, the English language underwent
revolutionary changes that brought a wealth of synonyms and an
increasing differentiation in usage as well as in meaning and
connotation, which was favorable to punning, verbal ambiguity and
malapropisms (see Redfern's <Puns>.  Despite these resources, English
literature developed into a tradition valuing precision more than
possibility and, developing this tradition, the nation-building colonial
agendas lie at the core.   Because language played the most important
role in forming national consciousness, due to the fact that the
geography of Europe doesn't lend itself to obvious admistrative or
military boundaries (a point made by Harris and Taylor in one of their
linguistic histories), nation-building required dictionaries, grammars
and a repression of ambiguity in language use.  Furthermore, the
colonial project required an aesthics of mastery and rejection of
passivity and a refusal of difference generally.

It's in the context of nation-building, language standardization, and
the pun's feminization that Jonathan Swift presents the first example of
writing in English to use errant lexis for the explicit purpose of
disrupting identity constructed through a normalized language use.
Lewis Carroll also employs abundant wordplay as a form of political
dissidence.  However, not until the twentieth-century, and not
coincidently the beginning of post-colonialism, does a Western
aesthetics that embraces the pun emerge.  The twentieth-century produces
many writers who engage in a politicized punning, for e.g., in Eugene
Jolas's "transitions", writers embrace what Jolas called "an
interpenetration of languages and other racial elements such as had
never been attempted or dreamed of," a revolution of the word the
ultimate manifestation of which is, of course, Finnegan's Wake.  Here,
Joyce puns between languages, enacting an aesthetics of passivity and
challeging nationalism and xenophobia.

Many lit theorists and other experimental and exploratory writers of the
late twentieth century share the Modern emphasis on punning and creating
new linguistic orders, however, contemporary punsters of the mid-to late
twentieth century and forward remain wary of any new perfect order as
imagined by the Moderns.  Currently, an abundance of punsters  --
Bernstein, Cixous, Derrida, Howe, McLow, Melnick, Mullen, etc. --
attempt linguistic systems of essential endemic disorder.  These systems
enact a set of relations that include the traditionally excluded.
Wordplay and lexical errancy attempt a literature free of nationalist
agendas that regulate and delimit identity and community.   Noise, that
is that which has been excluded as 'le autre', is the defining
constitutive element of the abundantly punning text.  Portmanteau, puns,
neologisms, and the occasional ecstatic whirling gibberish provide sites
of irreconcilable non-assimilable pluralities.

"A Prophetic ferocity joins visceral appetite in Garrett Kalleberg's
powerful new collection, spirit and matter couple to spawn a ravishing
anxiety, 'a beautiful disaster.' As if language were a skin wrapped around
the world's body which ruptures and spills its will to be named." - Ann
Lauterbach


"Drawing variously from the rhetorics of science, religion, psychology, and
metaphysics, Kalleberg investigates the place where proof and belief overlap
in a logical moire--" - Heather Ramsdell


"I found a book (The Monster Lives of Boys & Girls), learned the beloved's
possible name, watched a 'body lost also in beauty, sadness, simple joys'
and intellection..."
- Eleni Sikelianos


Garrett Kalleberg is the author of Psychological Corporations (Spuyten
Duyvil), Limbic Odes (Heart Hammer), and co-author of a forthcoming play
"The Situation Room." His work has appeared in Talisman, Sulfur, Denver
Quarterly, Mandorla, Poetry Project Newsletter, and in An Anthology of New
(American) Poets.  He  publishes the online journal The Transcendental
Friend (http://www.morningred.com/friend), and audio CD imprint immanent

Possibly the reason that music comes to mind as a good analogy to much
contemporary writing can be seen in the contrast between Bach's contrapuntal
forms (point and counterpoint in which set -arguments- have no choice but to
entwine around each other again and again because themes had to be
identifiably preserved throughout the text) and those of, say, Debussy,
where the content of the thematic material is constantly mutating, and in
some instances, may not even be clearly identified or stated in the first
place. However, to my listening, in Debussy's most interesting work, for
example-Nocturnes- this constant recourse to indeterminacy in no way limits
the ability to depict or evoke nuances of emotion. I don't see an equivalent
palate of emotion in Mozart, for example or even Webern, although much more
emotional intensity in Webern. Now clearly Debussy is not employing any kind
of set procedure; on the other hand, a case could be made for comparing the
flow of Debussy to the flow of reverie in thought. I think a change takes
place in what Tom Bell refers to as -investigation- when phenomenological
investigation more and more cames to embrace all states of mind that could
possibly be unearthed, imagined or suggested. This is in direct
contradiction, of course, to the procedures, or rituals, of most formal
religions, for example, a point that Freud was at pains to point out in such
works as The Future of An illusion. (Strange that Freud was so uninterested
in music). I think it leads to a distortion of psychoanalysis, however, to
characterize it too strictly by specific procedures, though there are
specific procedures that are recommended for both analysand and analyst.
Since the unconscious can only be approached indirectly, and by
approximation, the analyst must be prepared to improvise interventions in
order to successfully track sources of unconscious deformations of reality.
Barrett speaks interestingly of a phenomenology of information that relates
to processing a sediment of -part voices- and -recombinant selves-.  In
psychoanalysis this would have to do with unearthing memories. In
psychoanalysis memories are frequently found to be frozen in unprocessed,
unreflective, repetitive cycles of affects and clusters of anxious
reactions. Barrett also talks about the crucial aspect of recognition in the
arts, and that responses enhance identity feelings. I am interested in
trying to weave some of these notions towards a clearer sense of
recognizable textures of purpose, motivation and momentum, for example,
specifically in poetic processes such as poetics.
Wouldn't it be useful to understand why writing and publishing poetry
creates such strong issues around recognition and response? I understand
many of these issues cluster around hierarchy and career,canonization and
assessments that have everything to do with the question of the evolutionary
value of particular works. But I have a hunch there are actually more
structure and process related issues having to do with the forms and
procedures that contemporary poets feel driven to employ. I am in a
relatively strong position to make some basic comparisons as I have been a
practitioner in both psychoanalysis and poetry for some time. In the daily
work of psychoanalysis, the material of the analysis is in relatively
constant view of both the analyst and the analysand. In the daily work of
the poet, there is no such analogical process. Frequently the poet has to
wait for quite a long time to receive much, if any, response to specific
works or any kind of objective- or even subjective- assessment of their
effects or impacts on others or general applicability of particular
procedures discovered in and by these works. As a result, the poet is thrown
into the position of providing or mimicking this entire process internally.
Here is where Barrett's part voices and recombinant selves may come in.
These may consist of certain previous evaluative responses to certain
aspects of the poet's specific works, themes or characters and or the poet's
responses to aspects of such things in the the specific works of other poets
and critical responses to their poetry. These are the part-voices and
recombinant selves that people the poet's inner world of voices composed of
the poet's continually deciphered, multiply interpreted and symbolically and
formalistically transposed poetic references and their associations. Millie
Niss may have been alluding to picking up on such a process in Jack Spicer.
What she may be referring to as -fake- might be better understood as
-mimed-. So the poet begins to identify mimed aspects in the works, all
kinds of echoes and reverberations of important moments in the reception of
heard and read poetry, music, works of visual art seen and processed, as
well as music, and the synesthetic effects of the combined reception of all
of these works. This is certainly why contemporary innovative poets are
drawn to multi-media procedures which seem to offer a prospect of reflecting
and transmuting such category- eroding experiences. But aren't these very
exhaustive and exhausting efforts on the part of innovative contemporary
poets to produce representative artistic responses to such complexly
theorized interactions doomed internally to lead eventually to a personal
cul-de-sac, not at all for the combined efforts of the community of poets on
the whole, but for the actual sense of accomplishment and progress - there's
that word again- of any particular poet? And while much can be said for the
benefits of poetic community and for the combined accomplishments of say,
the L-A group, it seems that individual poets must still experience intense
difficulties in finding momentum to continue to progress and move forward,
when specific forms of recognition for specific individual projects are so
slow in coming, if ever?
As valuable as the outcomes of these agonistic struggles might be for their
challenges to the innovative imaginations of individual poetic
accomplishment, and as beneficial as these accomplishments might be to the
combined community effort towards poetic discoveries as measurable by the
focussed inquiries of sympathetic professional critics working within the
academic community, it has always been my earnest hope that work in poetics
might someday find ways to limit the necessity for so much hurt and
displeasure and discontent, and the damage such experiences frequently wreak
within the inner lives of some of the most creative minds in our culture.
Yes, they are destroyed by madness, but even more by the frustrating, even
sadistic indifference of mainstream culture and all too often, even by
poets' self-created culture. The idea of a Baudlairian dandyism, bohemian or
dressed-up masochism, bad boy and bad girl acting out and cursing out of
mainstream culture, or sophisticated isolated jibing of it or mystification
of it, even along with the support of sincere, sympathetic and even profound
academic interpretation, none of it will for very long deflect the poet's
inevitable, frightening momentum towards that cultural quicksand, the morass
of cultural isolation and its accompanying bitterness. Always the practical
issues with an infinity of poetic implications on every level of choice.
Something else is needed. It has everything to do with content,  progress,
material, part-voices, investigation, recognition, childhood memories,
recombinant selves, procedure, fakes, imitations, mimicry, handwritten
poetry, visual poetry, sound poetry, web poetry, langpo, psychoanalysis,
knowledge, dialogue, databases, pleasure, projection and more. I'm looking
to poetics

Do you mean poets who write in more than one language, or those write =
macaronic poetry? If the former, my wife Katia Kapovich writes very =
successfully in Russian and English. I too started out as a Russian poet =
and published a fair amount in Russian, but that was a while ago. I only =
write original verse in English these days, but I translate into Russian =
on occasion. Another example, our friend Alexander Stessin writes very =
well in English and Russian. And our friend Yunte Huang writes in =
English and Mandarin. Does this help at all?

actually, this is what this is originally referring to. it's on the anansi
web-site but has it actually been released? with the turmoil in canadian
publishing right now i'd be inclined to think not but my friend lisa
moores' book _Naked_ is brand new and available.

has anyone seen _Avant Guard for Thee_ yet?

Sandra,
Here is a poem of mine based on the "translation" of different parts of the=20
Turkish word "Ankara" (the capital of modern turkey). "Ankara: my kind=20
hearted step mother" is a quote from the turkish poet Cemal S=FCreya.=20


            An/kara: My Kind Hearted Step Mother

Ankara.
An--: moment, second.
kara: black.
Ankara:
Second black, not first.
An(a): mother.
kar: doing it.
kar: snow.
kar(a): to the snow.
kara: land.
kara: black.
K(i)r: prick.
kar(i): the snow.
kari: old crone.
Kirhane: prick house
next to our synagogue in Istanbul there was a prick house,=20
on wooden tables at the end of Yom Kippur
in the dark, in the intersection of our street and theirs,
the ladies of the night and their pimps left
glasses of water for us to drink
for free: Sebil.
Mysterious Cybil.
So civil-
Ized.
Realized.
thirty years later I went to the same spot.
the synagogue and its porch garden
(where I'd spent two evenings a year, the twinkling lights mixing with the=20
stars through the  =20
Succah)
was all in ruins,

Russian emigre poet Konstantin Kuzminsky, who lives in upstate NY, has been writing "poetry in tongues," as he calls it, for 30 years now. His landmark one-page prose poem Leopold Havelka incorporates words and phrases from about 30 languages. Kuzminsky has written poems in most European languages, as well as in some most obscure African and Polyneasian langs. You can find the recent NY Times article about him here: http://magazinnik.com/NYT.htm
There is also an entry on him in the 2nd edition of Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes (edited by R. Kostelanetz, Schirmer Press, 2001)

Subject:      Close reading: Minnis, "A Speech About the Moon"
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Who said the lyric speaker was dead?  On the contrary, what we have in the
case of Minnis is full-blown lyric exhibitionism, a mode in which in
nothing is real but the personality and its inexplicable urges.  Doesn't
this show that Language writing's hostility to the "voice" is not really
shared by all "formally innovative" younger poets?

_Zirconia_ is one strange fit of passion after another.  Keats asked, "Why
did I laugh tonight?"  That seems to be Minnis's question too, for her most
characteristic stance is one of a passive sufferer of states of euphoria.
Here is "A Speech to the Moon":

http://www.fencemag.com/v1n2/work/chelseyminnis.html

The poem's histrionic quality is evident in the title: we're hearing a
monologue, complete with stage directions ("I think..."  "Then I think..."
"Then I start to cry...").  Minnis is a performer, really, of her own
emotions, whose strangeness is evoked by the strangeness of the images that
come into her mind.  Her thoughts are indeed "like terrible ballet teachers
with canes" in the sense that they seem to be telling her things and making
demands that she doesn't quite grasp.  (See, for example, her hilarious
"Report on the Babies," in which each infant the poet encounters seems to
be trying to communicate with her telepathically.)

What is sometimes hard to take is the self-conscious cuteness of her style.
Many readers will gag on lines like: "I want to wear hot pants," "I'm ready
to plunge into furs," and "A skull ring is actually a good complement to my
diabolical will."  This is a particular kind of comic preciosity that women
poets can get away with.  Basically, it's camp.  Men who try it come off as
drag queens, which suggests that Minnis risks performing a stereotype of
femininity.  I raise this point only because the poet won $5,000, in part,
for being the right gender.  I myself think her refusals of solemnity pay
off in many cases, and that the cuteness can't really be separated from her
individual style.

<P>Dear Andrew, I actually find the baby poem a bit harder to take. I am interested in your observation that women poets can get away with some kind of "comic preciosity" due to their (our) gender. Really? I don't think so, I think maybe she is using a humor or a state of mind that women might relate to more easily than men, whether it makes either gender gag or not. (Personally I wouldn't use the word gag in a close reading.) But what interests me the most is your mention of drag queens. Personally I have thought at times that drag queens are verging awfully close to blackface performers. But that is probably something I shouldn't say here or elsewhere. But I find it interesting that what is perhaps liberating to a man is seen as "comic" in a woman (not that you are saying this, but your argument seems predicated on it to me.)</P>

I'm melding these threads as they do seem to come together for me.

I think Nick has voiced his search quite admirably but do have to question his goal of "I'm looking to poetics" as an end.  To draw the analogy, it seems to me that in some ways this would be somewhat like looking to Freud and arguments about theory rath than arguments THROUGH practice as seen through practitioners 'doing therapy'.  I have a feeling that Nick understands when I say that when I'm doing therapy it's based on  bedrock of theory but the actualmpractice (what I say or don't say) is somewhat like a duet and my part is basedon my experience and my experiences of the client as they happen as we seek something that might be helpful.  It's neither objective nor subjective to either.

I'm not sure what direction this leads toward, but do feel it's intwined with something on the close reading thread here as seen in reflecting on biographical, lyric, and workshop work and the focus or anti-focus on the poet.  One of the central things with all of these that I think is problematic is the narcisstic focus on the self of the poet (or the anti-narcisstic ploy that is sometimes played)

One of the ways I have been pursuing out of this trap is to try and bring into the poem itself some of the 'institutinal sclerosis' (Mez' great term) and I suspect the same is true for 'techno' work with the hope that with a little imagination the reader can allow herself to be within the institutional sclerosis.

I think another way out of the trap is to be found in the actual artist statements in _Homo Sonorus_ , especially those that take the stance of poem or artwork as 'experiment' and invite the reader to participate rather than proceeding in the artist as hero or heroine stance.

once again I am thinking as I write and jammed for time, but?

There is little chance of deploying a natural (human) language at all
without the appearance of puns, broadly understood.  The poster's
terminology, that language poets "use" puns, follows the traditional
view that puns are not really puns unless they contribute somehow to a
coherent semantic trajectory in line with or resonating with other
semantic trajectories of the poem. So the adjectival "still" 'motionless'
is always a pun with adverbial "still" 'continuing', but it is not
recognized as such until the poem sanctions both readings -- thou
still  unravished bride of quietness...forever warm and still to be
enjoyed, for ever panting, and forever young...

When language poetry dispenses with the coherent semantic trajectory
associated with the standard transparent sentence, it also thereby
discards the mechanism by which polysemy, homophony, etc. are recognized
as puns in the narrow sense.  These points at which language depends on
some kind of context for disambiguation become exactly the
points at which language itself becomes the producer of meaning -- the
writing appears as if meaning has emerged from the language itself rather
than having been "used" by someone to achieve a particular goal.  The pun
becomes the type of all meaning production available to language --
accidental rather than intentional and cooperative rather than autocratic.

Breast Cancer Claims Life of =91Mother Poet=92 June Jordan
Jordan Started Poetry for the People at UC Berkeley


                 By VIRGINIA GRIFFEY
                 and PAUL THORNTON
                 Contributing Writers
                 Tuesday, June 18, 2002

"At least she was riding beside somebody going somewhere fast about love,"
award-winning poet June Jordan wrote about the death of Princess Diana in
1997.

Those whose lives were touched by Jordan, who died Friday of breast cancer,
could say, "At least she died a 'fighter,' a 'mother poet' and someone who
was 'always laughing.'"

She was the poet, activist and UC Berkeley professor who started the
celebrated Poetry for the People program at UC Berkeley in 1990. She died a=
t
age 65.

In a column for The Progressive magazine last September, she described her
background: "I am the daughter of peasants who begged and borrowed their wa=
y
to these United States. They wanted an escape from
no-shoes-no-drinkable-water poverty."

Marcos Ram=EDrez, a UC Berkeley alumnus who first took the course in 1994,
said Jordan's class was the most beautiful experience he has had.

"She's like a mother poet to a lot of students," Ram=EDrez said. "I'll
never, never forget that." He remembers Jordan as a teacher who spawned a
deep interestin poetry in students who took her course.

"Without her I never would have become a poet," Ram=EDrez said. "(Former
students) come back to class and say, 'I started out here a stupid, blind
fool, and now I have a book of my own.'"

Those she touched were not limited to those she taught.

"It's just such a huge loss because she was, on one level, a fighter," said
Matthew Rothschild, editor of The Progressive. "She had such a fierce
resistance to injustice. On the other hand, she had a real great sense of
humor and a tenderness about her that was unique to her."

Jordan attended Barnard College and the University of Chicago but never
earned a degree. She started writing poetry as a child, and her numerous
honors and awards include a Rockefeller grant for creative
writing and the Achievement Award for International Reporting from the
National Association of Black Journalists.

"We were honored to have her write for (The Progressive), and many of the
essays that she wrote for us in the last 12 years are gems," Rothschild
said. "She opened my eyes to a whole range of issues and art. She turned me
on to political poetry."

Poetry for the People is now in jeopardy. The class is not listed in the
fall 2002 online schedule of classes, and because of a possible lack of
funding from the Undergraduate Division of the College of
Letters and Science, it may not be offered in the fall.

Jordan taught the course for its first 11 years and passed it on last
semester to lecturer Junichi Semitsu. Jordan was on medical leave last
semester.

With 110 students enrolled last semester, the course provided students with
a forum to display their poetry and invited ethnic poets to discuss their
experiences. Charles Henry, professor and chair of the
Department of African American Studies, was unavailable to comment on the
course's future. .

The course also provided poetry workshops at Berkeley High School, San
Francisco's Glide Memorial Church and Dublin Women's Prison, which Ram=EDrez
said was part of Jordan's focus on building a "beloved community."

"I loved June," Ram=EDrez said. "She was there for everybody. We went to New
York with her on a book tour=97the whole class. That's the kind of person she
was."

A campus memorial service is planned tentatively for September, and there
will be no formal funeral service, Henry said in a statement. Jordan is
survived by her son.

"I can't imagine UC Berkeley without Poetry for the People and June Jordan,=
"
Ram=EDrez said. "We have to carry the light for her."

A double-issue of _The Gig_ magazine is in preparation, to be published on
April 1st, 2003. This will be a perfectbound book of essays on the work of
Tom Raworth. Tom has published over 40 volumes of poetry and prose, and has
been active for four decades as an editor, publisher, printer, visual
artist, collaborator and translator; his books include _The Relation Ship_,
_A Serial Biography_, _Moving_, _Act_, _Ace_, _Logbook_, _Writing_, _Clean &
Well Lit_ and a selected poems, _Tottering State_ (now in its 3rd edition,
from O Books). _The Gig_'s special issue will be the first substantial

amount may of course be increased by anyone who wishes thus to support the

Kari.  NO. I made a sincere complement.  I added the rest which is in the
vein of my usual nochalant ravings which eg Alan Sondheim likes but maybe no
one else its just what I do: in fact if I was satiriising anyone it was
MYSELF.

THE REASON FOR INCLUDING IT WAS THAT I GET A BIT MIFFED AT THE FACT THAT
THEY ONLY ALLOW TWO EMIALS PER DAY PER MEMBER.

So the message was 1)  To kari edwards beautiful poems especially the first
one. Brilliant work: I like that kind of writing you are doing. 2) Good
credentials.  Then I added:  The following is separate, IT IS NOT SATIRE OR
ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOUR WORK OR BIO and that message was my usual rave: in
fact it has some quotes from the back of my own book (my immortal "Singing
in the Slaughterhouse" 1991, Auckland. ... if I do satirise Bios it is not
serious:

I've sent bios and they usually say something like: Richard is New Zealand's
most brillaint failure and has been known to move on occasion.(That was in
Poetry New Zealand)(or something like it). My initial aproach would be like
yours of course, more respectful....

So: there were TWO very SEPARATE messages for the price of one.

I might be an idiot but I am not hurtful of people: or I try my best in my
gloomed skull....

I say  e leai (sorry in Samoan) for the confusion. Sincerely, yours

Richard von Taylor.

Can't get over seasons-- have read Foucault and such, and disciplined
and punished frequently, maybe not enough, but I really like this list.

Mr. Watten gets to the heart of all these issues, and I can't help but
relate them to the delete key-- read on, this is hardly an Eminemesque
diss.  We have time, we do things with it.  Filters are far from
obvious-- people like us (humanist overstatement) read on lists like
this because there might be something we can build on/respond to.

When I check email after a long day of grading papers, writing a pretty
weak dissertation on 20th century poetry, drinking, whatever, the
approaches to "intellectual stimulation" are based on:

1)  Whether or not my computer science roommate is home listening to
Candlebox and cooking instant waffles,

2)  Whether or not I have a phone message from my dad who is getting
older and close to dying,

3)  Whether or not I want to read books or books about books or books
about books about people reading books,

4)  Whether or not my desire for something called "art" shall
overcome/outweigh my desire to accomplish very simple, very
"pleasurable" tasks like eating, fornicating, listening to the new
Guided by Voices album, going to the local three-dollar movie theater
even if they're showing crap films (which are kind of fun if you only
have to pay three dollars).

My question-- is the critique of pleasure still possible?  How does this
relate to content, in both senses?  It's kind of weird to discuss
something like Detroit techno, which has been around for over ten years,
when I have a crush on a girl who made fun of me for buying the last
Dntel release, and for liking the third-to-last Squarepusher, when I
should like the last one.  She says.

My pleasure taken from UBPoetics is panning for wisdom between emails
for "Fisting Fun" and "Credit Solutions for Life" and "Farm Girls Make
the Animals Happy" and "You now own a car!"  Simple humanist says, this
is abhorrent victory of global capitalism, lil' French theorista says
yes, you want this, humble wannabe-poet says go take walk and see how
the crippled dog next door is doing and give it a pet around the ears.

Just as long as we're being honest-- are we failed for not being
"political" enough when we read email and maybe a poem or a novel or the
newspaper?  I think pleasure is generally blank, as in-- I enjoyed
something and I could tell you about it, but that's that.  And I do take
pleasure in things like labor strikes by graduate students at an
overly-funded public university as well-- we generally go out afterwards
and have beer and listen to "authentic" things like the Clash or the
Ramones.  And we pay for this fun, but we don't at the same time.
What's beyond fun?

Content/indeed,

George Etal.   I was alerted initially to Perec via  I think either Tony or
Scott Hamilton and then of course via Perloff's "Radical Artifice" which I
mentioned to Tony last night at a reading here in Auckland.  I actually have
Les Choses in French (PB) (cant read it very well though if at all...)
...but Perec is a fascinating writer: my take on what I know of him is that
eg A Void waas trying to show concretly something that possesed him then and
the void an so on (the absence of "e" was it or "a" ?) and by "content" and
once he'd doe that he did his puzzles nad so one and his "Life A User's
Manual" which i've read part of: he must have been influenced by
Robett-Grillet and maybe Raymond Rousell (J A's baby) R-B is a favourite
writer of mine: but in regard to Perec I have a feeling that the fact that
"Avoid" was in prose already "evens ' the language and the "tenor" of the
work and I assume from what others have said it is the accumulative affect
that is interesting and possibly quite powerful: I think what Tony is trying
to do is good in its place (it would be good merely as a kind of "five
finger exercise")but by restricting himself in this way any weaknesses
become magnified: I myself find the repetition too cloying too much: but it
doesnt mean that Tony's efforts are wasted (I know you havent said
that)...it is true that "its been done before" but maybe by dint of effort
Tony may get to something "rich and strange"...some of the lines are quite
haunting: my problem with (not only Tonys is (if the writing doesnt seize me
so to speak and that could be my fault) is I begin to question "why"
although I've also asked that of my own writing and  answer came there
none....)
  Tony is  young (comp. to me) and he may develop with study and good old
Time...I feel he's going for something that is to Rousellian: too self
enclosed may over Swinburnated... although whose to say what's "too"
anything: that's my feeling:but maybe he'll burst thru into something new
and precious, who knows... Auden with his formal experiments and usage
usually has something to communicate and that impulse he passed on to a lot
of younger writers......nowadays we've moved right on. Just some thoughts.
Perec's total ouevre I feel had a lot to do with riddling and his humour and
maybe that sense of the Void:( I wish I could read French)...(eg his amusing
post cards sent Calvino) and  so on... Regards, Richard.

Which "language" poets are you referring to, who dispense "with the coherent
semantic trajectory"?  Certainly not Lyn Hejinian, whom you quote.
Certainly not Ron Silliman, Bob Perelman, Carla Harryman, Rae Armantrout,
Ray DiPalma.  These poets all dispense with coherent ~narrative~
trajectory-- but that is something else again.  Well, yes there is also
Bruce Andrews, whose works are often funnier (notice I didn't say "fun")
than one might expect.  Yet even he undoubtedly is "using" language to
achieve his "goals."

(What is a ~semantic~ trajectory, anyway?  Here I think you may mean
grammatical trajectory, unless you are thinking of the connotations of words
leading one to the other in an orderly fashion.  All of these poets set
meanings ricocheting-- but that is also true of many poets you wouldn't
think of as langpos.  Here we have to refer to semantic TRAJECTORIES in the
sense of not being limited to one).

As for a "natural (human) language," I don't believe I have encountered that
beast.

here's an interesting but annoying feature in Microsoft Word.  I just typed
"April is the most depressing month," and up popped a little cartoon of
Calliope with a talk balloon that said:


  It looks like you're writing a poem.

  Would you like to get help?

  o  Get help with writing the poem

  o  Just type the poem without help

  o  Cancel


Has anyone else seen this??

        When I do it I get a caricature cartoon of a very portly Ford
Maddox Ford starting on how he, Elliot and Pound would go on over supper
about the weather and how cruel that month was in London. He claims it
was he and not Pound who edited the first line ... does anyone know how
to shut this feature off??? I can't stand it anymore ... he keeps
smacking his cartoon lips and is making me not want to eat lunch

here's an interesting but annoying feature in Microsoft Word.  I just
typed
"April is the most depressing month," and up popped a little cartoon of
Calliope with a talk balloon that said:


  It looks like you're writing a poem.

  Would you like to get help?

  o  Get help with writing the poem

  o  Just type the poem without help

  o  Cancel


Has anyone else seen this??

This Poem Wizard must be a new feature, one I'll no doubt  find on the =
new computer I expect to receive next week. It doesn't happen on the =
Word 6.0 on my 1998 computer. But then, I use WordPerfect, which seems =
to be on one side of a sectarian split between Word and WordPerfect =
users.

While this might be a handy guide for a high school homework assignment, =
I'd feel insulted by The Inanimate (and Microsoft)  if a little Wizard =
were to pop up and stick his nose into a poem I was writing. I've been =
writing poems long enough without help, thanks. =20

But incidents like this make me understand why Hunter Thompson and Elvis =
Presley shot their TV sets in their more twisted moments.=20

When the new computer arrives, I won't try to write a poem using Word. I =
don't want to go gonzo before I've even paid the bill. If I lapse, I'll =
try to keep a water pistol handy.

Thanks for the heads-up.

I would like to use one of each member's allotted two posts per day to
make a non-snotty remark (Sinuplex, it's great stuff) and say that these
two poets totally, unequivocally rock. Such is my word. Moure, for
example, has evolved into this incredible po-form that just makes you
gasp. Everyone should read them both.

one time in a fit of pique i called up my little

and typed "Why write"

he came back with (the comma splice in the last option
is his, not mine!)



what do you want to do?

-type text
-type existing text
-automatically create a letter in Japanese
-use the Letter wizard to create a Japanese letter
-create a letter in English when you work in another
language
-create a letter in Japanese
-create a letter
-get help for Visual Basic for Applications in Word
-obtain a digital certificate
-none of the above, look for more help on the web

Two very interesting poets in the latest issue of COMBO (#10):
Yago Said Cura and Romina Freschi - the poems include Spanish and English

Not only is this Friday, June 21st, the summer solstice, there's going to be
a reading in my backyard too.  Not just my kneck of the woods, actually in
my yard.

The lineup:

Nikki Reimer:  Red-hot stone found mainly along 17th Ave SW under close
scrutiny by several local geologists.

Tom Muir:  Has been seen around town waving his fingers at the sides of his
head, we believe he is a moose in human disguise.  Further research pending.

Janet Neigh:  If the future is an archive, then we are digitized only
moments from now and the program will be unveiled, though not necessarily by
Janet, and not necessarily in Calgary.

Ian Samuels:  This web-like protocol understands the innate actions of the
food-paths in and around Calgary's downtown core from studious observation
of the subjects in their natural habitat.  His mind keeps the buildings up.

Further notes:

Weather permitting.  There is limited seating, so bring a chair, bring a
blanket, some beverages, some food.  And bring some writing as well.  There
will be an open mic for as long as the sun will allow.  Please limit open
mic time to one or two poems.

The details:

1340 19th Ave NW
Calgary, Alberta
T2M 1A5

7:00 PM

For information, or further details, please call 237-8519 or email

Hope to see you there.

I think the number of poets who have wrote well in different languages is
minimal; Milton's Latin poems are second-rate, for example, as are Eliot's
French pieces. I have no doubt that it is possible to do so, but the names
that have been largely cited here have evinced in me a reaction that borders
on 'yer wot?'. The ability to write in more than one tongue does not mean
that the productions in second or third languages will be any good.

Any artist has to respect his/her material, in the case of poetry that
material is simply and just language, pallid washes of other speech do not
work. Period. They just bore.

seems, tho, that a great deal of the names cited here have english as their

Dave,

I think your argument misses the point. What we (at least myself) are talking
about here is the simultaneous presence in two languages, more specifically,
in the rift/break space between two languages - something Goddardian in
poetry -a montage of breaks...

Kazim,

The Spicer book of books is a great read.
I would have suggested the new Collected Oppen, even though.

Or perhaps a couple POETICS LIST people:
Maybe Susan Wheeler's _Source Codes_ as it's been mentioned a bit
recently. Or going back a couple years, Rachel Loden's _Hotel
Imperium_ remains one of my favorites.

Best,

How about an example? It's still not clear if you mean macaronics or say

Rod Smith.  Currently I'm seeking critical responses to Smith's work, of =
various kinds, and would appreciate anyone who's written and / or =
published work on this poet's work to contact me.  Not only am I =
building a bibliography to be published at the EPC, but I hope to =
publish a good amount of criticism on the site. =20

Please reply to pdurgin@acsu.buffalo.edu - and spread word to interested =

like (I think) Mark, I'm not quite clear what point it is that I'm supposed
to be missing. I can quite understand notions of bridging or opening the
rifts between different languages but all I am saying is that is
tremendously hard to do. Joyce's 'Finnegans Wake' has been cited on this
thread, to my mind it is a failure, some bits work, but overall.... no!

What seems to be bubbling under the surface is unhappily English as
everybody's second language, that saddens me, I can't imagine a clamour of
non-native speakers wanting to be recognised as poets in Lithuanian or
Burmese for example. I don't deny for a moment that it's possible to write
well in more than one language, but, gawd, it's hard.

Dave,

I think your argument misses the point. What we (at least myself) are
talking
about here is the simultaneous presence in two languages, more specifically,
in the rift/break space between two languages - something Goddardian in
poetry -a montage of breaks...

OK, now that's just plain funny . . . Aw shucks, author photos sure
are difficult things to sit still for, aren't they?

This is, for me, the most interesting aspect of the POETICS list (here
shone in its antic phase). How writing a poem or a book of poems is
one thing, say maybe step one in a conversation of monologues . . .
but the rest of the conversation around that poem or book goes on off
stage. So the poet writes something and then poof it's gone. And
people maybe talk or don't but the poet doesn't get to hear.

That's why I really liked how Susan Wheeler's _Source Codes_ was
talked about recently . . . and then how she joined the conversation.
(too bad it didn't continue longer) Would that all books were brought
up here in similar fashion.

As for author photos: Jorie Graham actually looks HAPPY in hers
(On the back of "Never" at your local bookstore).

best,
  JG

PS. And this one, though it's mercifully too small to actually see, John
is thinking "um, uh, I should be making some sort of face shouldn't I".
(And it was the best of the roll . . . gads)

I'm going to be teaching a course on "time and art" and would be
interested in hearing suggestions about possible texts to use.  It's a
freshman writing course, so these texts will need to be relatively
accessible.  Right now, I'm thinking that one unit will center on poetry,
one on painting and one on film (a fourth unit will be less text-based,
more anthropological and investigative).  The assumption of the course is
that time is a fundamental human "problem"-so that literary and visual
arts have evolved various strategies for controlling, regulating, and
negotiating it.  For the poetry unit, I'm thinking of using a few
Shakespeare sonnets, some haiku, Keats's "Ode on a Grecian Urn," Marvell's
"To His Coy Mistress," maybe also "Tintern Abbey."  For film, I'm thinking
of using Memento.  For painting, I'm least decided, but know I'd like to
do something with Cubism (and along with this, I want to introduce the
ideas of space-time and relativity).  Anyway, I'd love to hear further
suggestions for any of these various "arts," and I also want to put
together some essays (or excerpts) to use as well, so tips along these
lines would be valuable too.

Thanks in advance,

Quickly, and perhaps too obvious: it seems like you might include some =

Thank you, Aldon, for June Jordan's delicate "Bus Window" - but I did
appreciate that the NYTimes obit quoted one of the poems she read last
November (so vivid it seems just a month or so ago) at the celebration of the
Barnard Women's Center 30th anniversary.  She was all charm, energy and
feisty humor, and sparkled with unwavering sense of living political history.

#2 post o' the day

It is interesting to me that the overly-specific place and time titles are
romantic.

What about thinking of time in a variety of ways?

Music and time?

Shakespeare's plays not sonnets?

Memento is about memory-and-time.  What about simultinaity?  Split screen?
Campy lack of tracking (often involving clocks in lower budget movies)?
Teleporting?  Lost time in science fiction?  "Lost weekends"?

Time and grammar and tense?  Ways that questions / the interrogative and
answers take place in time?  Interstices?

Then a jillion poems come to mind.

Sounds like a cool class.

Be well,
Catherine Daly

The Pedestrian: Lower West Side, New York

At six thirty every night
he walks down Bleecker Street
stopping to look at a print
in a shop window: The Last Judgement.

At six thirty-eight he crosses
Bedford Street, going towards
St Luke's, stops at the corner
to stare intently
at rush-hour traffic.

Then he slips into Wendy's
and points to a Coke, but
they won't let him have it,
every day, no day.

At six fifty he falls to his knees
at the corner of Hudson and Clarkson
in front of the sidewalk signboard
for Spicer's Pet Shop
(Dogs, Cats, Aquarium Accessories).

For twenty minutes,
hands crossed on his chest,
he prays, either to Spicer,
or to the dogs,
or to the cats,
or to the fish,
or to New York,
or to the giant mouse of darkness
which has ten thousand eyes
in twenty-eight floors.

At seven fifteen,
soul purified,
he returns to his hotel,
where blue roses bloom on the walls
like blows from fists,
and Ra, the Egyptian god,
wearing the head of a jackal,
stares down from overhead.

much poetry/art is 'time mining'.

a book on theory of time which i found useful is deleuze's
'bergsonism' where he argues that time can be seen as a multiplicity
or singular, simultaneously.
for really, the only time there is is the present moment, all the
rest is memory of times past.
so much poetry either recalls times past, or clashes memories from
different time planes of the past.
there is of course poetry that just creates an 'of the moment'
experience which can not be compared to any past time but relies on a
fresh interpretation and the creative imagination of the end-user. i
find much langpo gives me this kind of experience, and much
cyberpoetry (new media poetry, web poetry, digital poetry, e-poetry,
and a million other names poetry written in a hypermedia system like
the web)(dynamic texts, random generators, user input).

many members of the webartery email discussion list compose 'of the
moment poetic experiences'.
(http://webartery.com/defib/webarterymembers.htm)
reiner strasser, peter howard, los glazier, myself and others are
more 'time-miners', but the work of poets like jason nelson, jim
rosenberg, mez breeze, are more of the moment experiences.


as for film, well, i use the movie 'sliding doors' to show parrallel
timelines, and 'the matrix' plays with issues of reality/fantasy, and
time.

then of course there is the whole 'timelessness' of the poetic/art
experience, where the end-user becomes unaware of clock-time and is
involved in the time-line/metaphorical space the piece induces.

Subject:      Close reading: O'Leary, "Elijah; or, At the Mouth of Fire"
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Heidegger says something to the effect that when people begin talking about
their religious experiences, it means they've lost their gods.  Which has a
certain wicked appeal, for it cuts through the crap of so much contemporary
"spirituality."  But poets' reluctance to deal with religion has not
necessarily been good for the art.  The romantics could still claim obscure
intimations of the supernatural, but only the rare poet like Duncan or
Merrill wanted to persist along that line.  And, on the other side of the
coin, neither do we see much satire of belief as practiced by Dickinson,
Hardy, and Frost.  When poets write about religion, they tend to stick to
their own misty experiences, not wanting to appear in bad taste.  Pound, by
contrast, could insist that the gods simply _are there_.  Who among us is
willing to make that kind of assertion?

Peter O'Leary might be willing (I'm not sure), but in any case his
predilection is to write about the gods objectively rather than traffic in
squishy "spirituality."  He writes as objectively as possible by sticking
to certain texts, traditions, monuments, and artifacts, whose power he
tries to extract or in some way borrow and illumine.  That the power of
these icons is primarily aesthetic rather than dogmatic can be seen in his
style, which is lush, lucid, and unpredictable.  Here is "Elijah; or, At
the Mouth of Fire" (published shortly after the release of Watchfulness,
his first book):

http://www.culturalsociety.org/elijah.html

Though based on the repetitive style of the scriptural narrative which it
"translates," the poem also exhibits a modernist desire for economy,
hardness, and, above all, vocality.  This is poetry that wants to be read
aloud ("What gold balm was agonistic orison in Elijah's mouth").  Although
a kind of dogma is hinted at in the opening line ("This is a lesson"), the
poem's focus is overwhelmingly on the immediate physicality of speech, the
"mouth / fanged with brass ash."  The physicality of the writing--both as
sound and description--suggests the vaguely heretical view that spirit is
part of the life of the flesh.  Elijah is above all active and intense, a
kind of artist even, suffering and creating.  The otherworldly "without" is
less prominent than the terrestrial goings-on.

The obvious risk of O'Leary's style is that it will seem either too
eccentric or perhaps too derivative (since it wears its influences rather
openly: Yeats, Bunting, Duncan, Ronald Johnson). But given the timidity of
so much contemporary poetry, and poets' reluctance to confront some of the
art's most crucial subjects, that kind of risk is always worth taking.

Yes, I think it must be very hard.  I respect anyone who can do it.

Would it sadden you less if English-language poets were the ones "crossing"
to other languages?

A fascinating list can be made of "second-language" writers.  For
starters...

English was Louis Zukofsky's second language.  Yiddish was his first.
(Aren't there other Jewish-American writers that was also true of?  What
about Stein?  Reznikoff?  Anybody have any information?)

I believe English was Anselm Hollo's third or fourth language.  (Anselm,
correct me if I'm wrong!)

Samuel Beckett.

Vladimir Nabokov.

Does anyone know if French was Wilhelm de Kostrowitsky's (a.k.a. Guillaume
Apollinaire's) first language?  The biographical information I have at hand
says he was born in Rome of Polish & Italian parents, received a French
education in Monaco & worked as a tutor in Germany before moving to Paris,
but it doesn't say what his first language was.

And let's not forget the Transylvanian-born NPR commentator, Andrei
Codrescu.

I'm not a big fan of his work, but I suppose I should also mention Joseph
Brodsky.

I'm sure there are other names we could add to this list, but that's all I
can think of at the moment.

Mark I think its - to use a word - its a question of semantics - I agree
with the first paragraph of IF we take one meaning of he previous writer
that he/she means a "coherent narrative structure" ...now in that case
polysemy, homophony, disjunction, ellipsis and so on is not as intensively
foregrounded: whereasin language poetry and of those you mention there is
mostly a coherence of semantic "information" as in the obvious example "My
Life" by Hejinian or enen BART by Silliman or in Nick Piombino's latest work
"Theoretical Objects" wherein Nick questions how procedure is to get going
and uses puns eg the word "solution" has a double meaning and while his
"manifestoes" are that: they are simultaneously poetic structures on their
own accord and also there is the aspect of process and so on. Pun's can be
"fun" but fun has unfortunate connotations: poetry as practiced by the
Language and other even  "normative" (so called) writers has a satisfaction,
a stimulus, a depth of  texture which is more than simplistic "fun"...the
term is fraught: words slip slide to quote that bogey man T S Eliot...but I
think the e-er probably meant your tragectories: one of the interesting
things that language poetry and other more cutting stuff can do is
simultaneously call language semantics and grammar etc into question AND use
it as a means to somehow convey meaning: which harks back to what I
understand of the contradiction in Derrida's philosophy ...not that I know
much about him: puns are irritating or can be and yet the subtle "language
slide" always heightens meaning: I think you are saying this also in a
different way.

I think that often the effect of Language etc writing is that meaning has
appeared or seemed to have emerged from the language itself: "appeared"
being a key word: I thus think that there's room for writers who have very
structured "boxes" of meaning and others who are kind of "pollockian"
(although even Pollock had in his mind somewhere I supppose a 'structure',
however strange or 'messy" that might appear to a viewer of his paintings),
and others work somewhere modulated between very strict determinism and
"random" or psuedo random.    Regards, Richard

The young French poet Jennifer Cazenave has just finished a long poem, Un
mat allonge' written in French and English, some sections in one, some in
the other, register frictional against register.  A powerful text, and
I've never seen the like, with one language so to speak healing the other.
A section or two in the recent Bard Papers.

'Finnegans Wake' is a disaster. Possibly the most gifted English language
writer of the last century spent 20 years of his life writing a book that
even he had forgot the meaning of in parts. There are occasional
brilliancy's but most of it is literally unreadable, believe me, I've tried.
I've never met anyone who has actually been able to read the book entire,
some pretend they have, for the kudos, but it's very transparent when people
do so.

David,

I talk about this a lot in my essay "Questions of Accent." (I think available
somewhere in the web and also in Black Sparrow Presses "Thus Spake the
Corpse.") In it I say that American English acts as a step-mother tongue in
American poetry into which poets inject their idiosyncratic sensibilities. An
American poet -not necessarily an English poet- has to re-learn English as a
foreign language.

Specifically, I had mentioned my own poem, "Ankara: my Kind Hearted Step
Mother," which I posted a few days ago here.
More generally, in certain translations, two languages exist superceded on
each other. Of course, that might require some explanation...

He romanticized his Spanish-Jewish background, but He was not first a
Spanish speaker, or at least I dont think he was.

Steve--

I regularly teach a class similar to the one you are speaking of
tho not first year & sans film, so some of these suggestions
might not be applicable--

poetry &art-- the armory show folks WCWilliams, Stieglitz, Stevens,
Marianne Moore, Davis, Kreyenborg DuChamp, #5 in gold & in red, etc.

action painting vs.ny school, o'hara, berrigan & other action types of
poetry

Ad Reinhardt  12 rules for a new academy (& any section from Selected
writings)- -vs Beckett, Camus, Sartre

Nam June Paik, Cage, Cunningham, & the RSVP structural book (a
compositional creation of scores from an architects point of view for
all forms of art)
-- tho certain of Paik's essays might prove difficult

Earthworks-- from Schwitters to Alice Aycock & their bent on myth vs.
John Clarke's notion of myth in From Feathers to Iron-- Clarke won't
work for you here but the first half could be compared to current poem
Generators, MacLow's or Cage's procedural explanation of poem creation,
or dadaist methods

Russian futurists vs their actual creations. compare Marinetti vs any
completed work, time here might not be obvious, the ? being what occurs
if one follows thru their suggestions to conclusion--

books-- most are from UCal, I would chose one:

Stiles--theories & documents of contemporary art works well (Cage
section is poop tho)

Joris & Rothenburg Poems for the new Millenium
might lean too hard on poems and higher vocab than 1st year
tho the Layout of Mallarme works extremely well & artcore kids love it

Fabozzi--Artists, Critics, Context-- the Cage, judy Chicago & Chomsky
sections rock, but the use of beat poetry is real tedious in compares to
the concepts presented--

There is one more, this is from memory, not in my office, drawing a
blank--

----then add RSVP factor, or photocopies of it, The Stranger, No exit,
Moore's collected
& Reinhardt (I'd pair that down for them, 2 or 3 of these probably)

--hope that is of use

Be well

I assume you're joking. This is rather tired Jungian analysis by way of
Campbell.

That O'Leary's angel speaks latin is interesting. Does the appeal to a
translation somehow elevate the words? Does it attempt to naturalize an
artifact of a very different culture to western Europe by pretending
that  Latin is the original?

We have no record of any culture in which folks don't talk about their
gods.  So unless Heidegger is saying that all peoples everywhere have lost
their gods he would seem to be overstepping.

Maybe it's neither timidity nor reluctance that keeps most contemporary
poets from dealing with religion but a sense that religion as you appear to
mean the word is irrelevant to them.

By the way, this scriptural narrative, like most of the prose in the old
testament, isn't written in a repetitive style.

Hi Steven,

Octavio Paz's "Children of the Mire" might be good one. I'm reading it now
and it's reasonably accessible. It's dealing, as I'm reading it, with
Various Christian, neo-platonic, Eastern, Mayan and more concepts of time
and their relationship to poetry (esp. his avant garde).

Also, to counter your course's assumption, you might pick a coupla pages
from Lefebvre's The Poetics of Space. Basically argues that time exists in
space rather than space in time.. and hey! it's a little revolutionary too.

BTW viz a viz Lefebvre, isn't that poem posted today by Halvard Johnson more
about place and space rather than time.. seems to justify the above
position..

Indeed does sound like an interesting course!

- Ben

John Yau's book on Andy Warhol (In the Realm of Appearances) has a passage
or two about how Warhol's work is resistant to (or in denial of) time;
contrasted with Jasper Johns' work, which Yau argues figures time into the
mix. I don't have my copy any more, or I'd quote a little from it. But, it's
pretty brilliant.

Gerald Burns' poetry (I think _Shorter Poems_ and _Longer Poems_ are both
still in print) and essays (_Toward a Phenomenology of Written Art_ and _A
Thing about Language_).

The publishing collective KRUPSKAYA announces our 2002 publications:


Arrival by Sarah Anne Cox
ISBN 1-928650-12-0
59 pages, $11

Sarah Anne Cox has written a startlingly fine book, prompted from the
investigating intelligence of a philosopher-poet unswerved by allegiance to
system. Her questions-"clauses of effort and fear"-make immediate demands
upon grammar's comfort and holding action, as they pry open the ear to a
newly sounded scale of voice you may almost recognize. This is a visionary
work, at once peripheral, diasporic, clustered, cocooned and exploded in
its claim on our relation to contemporary hood-wink.
-Kathleen Fraser


* * * * * * *

culture by Daniel Davidson
ISBN 1-928650-13-9
126 pages, $11

Politics for Dan Davidson was a site-specific performance art. Not street
theater, but the street theatricalized--except that "street" is too narrow,
too nostalgic a word for the many places, both public and private, where he
gave new twists to an old plot. In stores and offices, factories and
bedrooms, Dan found avenues for action undreamt by the revolutionaries he
admired. Calling the plot culture, he originated a role I'll never forget,
improvising an ending I'll never forgive. This book is his masterpiece.
-Benjamin Friedlander

Sugar Pill by Drew Gardner
ISBN 1-928650-14-7
70 pages, $11


* * * * * * *


c.c. by Tyrone Williams
ISBN 1-928650-15-5
95 pages, $11

Tyrone Williams' intensely moving first book bridges more gaps than many
words (and careers) thrice as long: quiet humor to quiet anger; weighty
concerns (cybernetics, anthropology, astronomy) to formal invention;
brilliant appropriation to startling beauty; street language to a full
panoply of sophisticated theory; above all between African American
concerns and those of the plain vanilla majority. The reference, as craft
and time demand, is ever to mother language. This uncommon rapture, a
burning repetition of home truths, in resolutely future tense, bears the
profound political motto of "character as a function of work." Character
survives.
-Nathaniel Tarn

Well, another candidate is the remarkable poet Jay Wright, who often breaks into Spanish in his English-language verse and who, at different stages in his career, has also woven Dogon (Malian) and Nahuatl (Aztec) in. If you're not familiar with his work, you might want to take a look at the following review <http://bostonreview.mit.edu/BR27.2/meyer.html>

Locust Music is seeking submissions its new Location Sound Sound Series.



Series one has as its focus the City and is called “Met Life”.



It’s basically pretty simple. Contributors are asked to field record a sound event of
their choice within an Urban environment of a duration not more than 24 minutes and not
less than 15.  Contributors are then asked to come up with a sound response to the field
recording. The response is stylistically open ended and left up to the will of the
artist. No one should have any reason to feel compelled to work within any specific
musical vocabulary or with a specific set of tools. There are no set rules of engagement
other than the producer be residing within an urban environment.  You may use this as an
opportunity to reinforce a connection with the city, to resist a relationship to it or to
act directly upon it. You might decide to remix some source material, sing a song, eat an
apple. etc. In other words, do what you please. As with the original recording, the
length should also fall between 15 and 24 minutes



The result of the two pieces will then be released on vinyl and cd. One side featuring
“unadulterated” field recordings and the other featuring the “response”. There will be 12
Volumes binding this initial series.



The guiding idea behind this project is two sided.  First, to pose a question, “How Does
environment already shape the form of a work?”  Second, as listeners, we often hear about
the influence a place has on a production but seldom do we get access to the backstage of
inspiration.  In this regard, process is the operative word here.



Contributors are encouraged to submit something of another media as well: writing,
photos, dirt, ephemera that pertains to the work and which can be reproduced in a
booklet. But You are not discouraged from submitting nothing else.





To be considered, please send submissions to the address below by the end of September
2002. Email questions to
<mailto:locationsound@locustmusic.com>locationsound@locustmusic.com





FUTURE SERIES ARE PLANNED AROUND THESE THEMES:  GARDENS, HOMES, ETC…..

you might find Jackson Mac Low's "simultaneities" a good ice-breaker and =

the collection BECOMINGS, Liz Grosz ed., and Deleuze's PURE IMMANENCE =

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS



Locust Music is developing a new series of improvisation releases called the object
improvisation series



The basic  premise is::



There are objects which come to mind upon hearing sound. They may be thought to be
objects which are suggestive of bearing sonic qualities or reveal an otherwise unclear
relationship between improvised music and the sense of an object.



Each CD is uniformly packaged with cropped mug shots of the performers and images of
objects which might be thought to suggest a relationship between sound and object...but
this doesn’t mean that the suggested tie has to make sense to anyone but the artists!



A mock template of the first of the series by Fred Lonberg-Holm / Axel Dorner is viewable
at <www.locustmusic.com/object.htm>www.locustmusic.com/object.htm.



There are no strict deadlines as this series is intended to be ongoing.



We encourage connections to be made after the fact or with great subtlety rather than

Hello All--Thanks for the good suggestions in response to my query on time
(I'd love to have more!).  I'm also wondering if anyone knows of
interesting
essays and/or short stories dealing with time travel paradoxes, multiple
dimensions, and all that sort of thing.  It occurs to me that I could use
the old Star Trek episode "City on the Edge of Forever" where Kirk, having
traveled back to 1930s Earth, must stand by as his true love (Joan
Collins!) is killed in a car accident--in order to prevent the Third Reich
from winning WWII (because in an alternate future, she becomes a peace
activist who convinces FDR to delay entry into the war for too long).
Anyone know of any particularly strong time travel episodes of STNG?  I'm
less familiar with that show, but seem to remember hearing there was
a good "time" episode.

Steve

Subject:      Close reading: Spahr, "Switching"
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Language writing's censorship of the individual voice is usually justified
as being good for "community" or at the very least "utopian."  Submerge
your voice within the general droning of the hive.  This isn't as easy as
it sounds, though, because everyone is in fact different from everyone
else, and poets are more different than most, damn their I's.

A graduate of Buffalo, Juliana Spahr seems to have taken the collectivist
imperative to heart, but her best poems betray an individual perspective.
Her experiment in _Fuck You-Aloha-I Love You_ is to see what happens when
you substitute the pronoun "we" for "I."  It's not as simple as that,
however, because she must also grind down her representations of experience
until they become interchangeable parts.  Her method for achieving this
experiential uniformity is to keep her style as commonplace as possible,
which is surprising given her location in one of the most unique places on
the planet.  Consider: she goes from Buffalo (Buffalo!) to Hawaii yet
begins her book by quoting Stein's quip about Oakland: there's no there
there.  Hawaii comes into a poem about a stream, but only as a setting for
a dispute over land use.  Nature is present only as a few proper nouns,
culture as a few traces of pidgin.  This is, to my mind, an _amazing_ feat
of discipline.  Here is "Switching":

http://www2.hawaii.edu/%7Espahr/syllabi/connects/switching.htm

However anti-individualist or generic this poem wants to be, though, what
it cannot explain is its own central "juxtaposition."  The juxtaposition is
there only because it "seems to make sense" to its "confused" author.  It
is thus a reminder of the poet's personality.  It shifts our attention from
the "we" back to the individual who speaks.  And that's a good thing, for
it improves the poem.  Of course there is something odd about her apparent
wish that intellectual exchanges could be more like fucking ("we need the
leg of our thinking on one's shoulder..." etc).  We know where Spahr is
coming from when she says this (a rather benign and hippy-ish notion of
human "connectedness"), but that is as nothing next to the kama-sutra-esque
image that lingers in the mind.  What is perhaps more interesting, however,
is the reverse implication, which is that fucking should be more
intellectual.  This is backed up the by the coldly rationalistic
description of the lovers' limbs.  The poet seems to want a kind of
unprejudiced sexual rationality in which each method of coupling is merely
one more permutation of the possible.  But the line that sticks in your
head is "This position does not even give the most pleasure."  You
immediately think: most pleasure _for whom_?  Who is talking: "we" or an
"I"?  For a moment the poet seems to grant that sex locks one into a
particular experience, a particular need which may be at cross-purposes
with anything outside itself.  Or, as she says at one point, "I am part of
a we and then I am not part of a we."  I think poetry is better served by
Option #2.

Yeah, I read Charles Bernstein's essay, too, but some of this really pushes
the edges a bit.  One can say that Williams' very early childhood was
bilingual, but he never had adult, or even latency-age, Spanish. This is a
pretty common phenomenon among first and second generation immigrants.  Few
of them are competent to write poetry in both languages, which may be why
Rezzie, Williams,  Zukofsky stuck to English, as opposed to say Glatsteyn,
who spoke English but  wasn't competent to write poetry in it. At the time
there was a pretty lively market for Yidish poetry, not to speak of
Spanish. Most  Latin American poets, by the way, think of chicano poetry as
subliterate--more accurate would be that the language is a new
invention.  I participated as translator in a reading in a chicano coffee
shop in LA by some Mexican poets. Many of the clientele afterwards told me
that they couldn't have followed the Spanish without my English.

Stein--very unlikely she spoke Yidish. Few secular Jews of German descent
do. But I'd be happyt to be corrected.

With those capable of switch-hitting, whether out of an extraordinary
linguistic ability  or a profound immersion in both languages from birth
and thereafter, the  interesting question is choice. Sometimes the factors
are clear--Armand Schwerner's French was no more peculiar than his
English--he was profoundly capoable in both but spoke in both his own
dialect. He chose to write in English, surrounded as he was by the American
environment. Beckett wrote eqyually well in each but chose both exile and
French. Picasso wrote some things in French, some in Spanish. Celan, who
spoke and wrote elegant French and lived in Paris, chose to write poetry in
German, altho he had Roumanian and Yidish available. Perhaps, after the
holocaust, he chose to conquer Germany the only way he could.

> Im

Im interested to know what languages Ann Tardos writes in & if they are languages
that she is familiar with or if she is working with them in a more homophonic
approach, which was my initial impression of a couple of her texts that Ive seen.

Im working on a multi-section visual verbal text called After Emmett...  the
first section is in english, second section is in bad french, the third in bad
turkish & now this new section is in indeciperable romanian.  while Ive had the
help of native speakers, Im less interested in in readibility than in the sort of
international gesturalism which is either evoked or the cause of a violent
reaction.  as kruchenykh says, "violent non-objectivity"...

I mean after all, realistically how many romanian readers will actually see this
work.


& in answer to David B...  there are a couple finnegan's wake traditions around
these parts...  WOODLAND PATTERNS, one of the world's epicenters of small press
literature in Milw often (not sure if it is yearly) has a finneagan's wake
reading marathon.  also performance artist Marshall Weber who for a number of
years was in Madison WI read finneagan's wake more than once in performance
without stopping.  it is afterall a measure of the probability & extent of the
human thot stream.

Listees All.  I heard, briefly, Joyce reading from it on an old recording:
it came "alive", it was magical: in fact I would love to hear that record
entire as that is the only way I'll probably ever read it....but have only
read about 10 pages of it: its a garagntuan "failure" if it is. I, too, have
no idea what its about and could only find out by reading "around" it:
however i heard somewhere that Joyce recommended people to treat it as a
kind of gigantic poem and not worry about ist "meaning" per se....its the
magic of the words and so on, the music that matters, its apparently  the
dream of an Earwig who lived in a gold mine and had an ioslated Penis and is
god and the devil and is also all human thoughts and a river of spume and
love and fear and fire and so on sonos scrunched into the letter c: i think
that sums it up but else I'm baffled......Nothing is a failure, I mean the
concept of failure is subjective except one might say that the guy who built
the original Firth bridge "failed" in that task: HE himself wasnt a failure
even though his bridge "failed", it sheared off and collapsed one night in a
storm  with a train going over it  and all these Scottish fuckers drowned
etc so he committed suicide: as long as Joyce got his jollies from writing
F.W. and Alan's father can read it twice well and good and others get
pleasure and so on its "good", better to write "Finnegans Wake" than to
drink yourself to death I suppose. Joyce knew too much which is why he kept
clear of the mafia: he he...Richard

Thanks for the elaboration.  I'd forgotten about Celan, & somehow was
unaware that Schwerner had French to that degree.

Other poets I forgot to mention-- Pierre Joris, Tristan Tzara.

hi everyone i just saw the most amazing book, L'Oiseau Schizophone, by
Franketienne, co-founder of the Haitian literary movement Spiralisme, about
which i know nothing.  it's kind of like Barabajan or conVERSations w
nathaniel mackey, but in french.  lots of fabulous neologisms.  it's a
mindblower.  published by jeanmichelplace.

isn't there a famous cortazar story (or is it carlos fuentes? no, i'm sure
it's cortazar) about a guy who is in the hospital for a motorcycle accident
and time-travels back to aztec times and it turns out he's running away
from folks who are going to sacrifice him...??? does tht ring a bell w/ the
better-read-than-i?  also, for another kind of time travel, "Incident at
Owl Creek" is always a goodie, and there's an old movie of it that i saw
when i was in high school, way back in the 70s. in terms of kids' books,
there's always the awesome a wrinkle in time, but is that considered a
"girls' book"???  you could get someone from eckancar to come talk to your
class...that's their big thing...

what about the tv series 'sliders'. each week they travel to a
parallel universe, or 'zena' episode where they kept waking to the
same day till they got it right?

There is a Finnegan's Wake Society which meets once a month (or maybe even
twice-- I lost their calendar; I think they meet on Tuesday nights, the
seciond and the fourth Tuesdays maybe.  The contact person is Murray Gross
at (212) 226-8903 -- but you don't have to call first to attend and there is
a pposter about it in the bookshop downstairs (I think) and the woirkers at
the bookshop certainly know when the meeting times are, so you can call the
Gotham Bookstore if you don't want to call an individual stranger) above the
Gotham bookstore in NYC on 47th Street, and they do a close reading of
Finnegan's Wake for an hour and a half each meeting.  I have attended two
meetings so I can verify the truth of this.  A bunch of people actually sit
around doing a close reading of a literary text, for the fun of it, when In
real life they are not scholars.  Moreover, the room is usually packed.
Everyoine has a book and the group is at a certain place in the book and
they slowly move forward.  Since they are on their second time around and
some members have been there the whole time, I can unequivocally assert that
some peole have not only read FW all the way through but have done a group
close reading of it.  It's a pretty amazing thing -- all these ordinary
seeming people with ordinary jobs turn out to be extremely erudite and catch
the most far-flung allusions, puns, patterms, etc.  (They especially like
pointing out and explaing the detailed sexuial joikes, which amuse eveyone
but you act as if the amusement were purely literary...) I did not keep up
with them but I hhighly recommend going at least once.  They are very
welcoming and will give you a special bookmark for your copy of FW which is
ruled so that you can determine what line a partiucular thing happens on, so
you can call out, line 25, third through fifth words -- a reference to the
tale of Cuchulain as a boy? or whatever.

'Finnegans Wake' is a disaster. Possibly the most gifted English language
writer of the last century spent 20 years of his life writing a book that
even he had forgot the meaning of in parts. There are occasional
brilliancy's but most of it is literally unreadable, believe me, I've tried.
I've never met anyone who has actually been able to read the book entire,
some pretend they have, for the kudos, but it's very transparent when people
do so.

Yes, I think it must be very hard.  I respect anyone who can do it.

Would it sadden you less if English-language poets were the ones "crossing"
to other languages?

A fascinating list can be made of "second-language" writers.  For
starters...

English was Louis Zukofsky's second language.  Yiddish was his first.
(Aren't there other Jewish-American writers that was also true of?  What
about Stein?  Reznikoff?  Anybody have any information?)

I believe English was Anselm Hollo's third or fourth language.  (Anselm,
correct me if I'm wrong!)

Samuel Beckett.

Vladimir Nabokov.

Does anyone know if French was Wilhelm de Kostrowitsky's (a.k.a. Guillaume
Apollinaire's) first language?  The biographical information I have at hand
says he was born in Rome of Polish & Italian parents, received a French
education in Monaco & worked as a tutor in Germany before moving to Paris,
but it doesn't say what his first language was.

And let's not forget the Transylvanian-born NPR commentator, Andrei
Codrescu.

I'm not a big fan of his work, but I suppose I should also mention Joseph
Brodsky.

I'm sure there are other names we could add to this list, but that's all I
can think of at the moment.

I have only read parts of Finnegan's wake or should I say Vinegar's cake
I found it incredibly dry, and what on earth did the author intend to
do by writing a book that was not very understandable by the majority
of us! We shouldn't have to take school lessons in order to understand
joyce's writing.

Millie and Udda Loistees. Voiry interesting wot u say. I've actually called
into the Gotham Bookshop its famous: when I was in NY in 1993 and there I
got a copy of the "poetry Calendar"...its on 47th street I think: my hotel
was not too far on the same street.
  But of course many people have read FW - Dave was being a bit satirical I
think: a lot probably pretend they have as its one of those vast tomes like
War and Peace.  As well as that there is actually a journal devoted
exclusively to Pound and also one to Joyce: its all very well...but can
become addictive I imagine: I met a bloke who'd got obsessed with FW for
seven years...its a bit like "The Search for the Golden Hare" phenomenom ...
old Joyce baby eh: he was a card: he liked his drink and his food and died
of a stomach ulcer: he was born same day (of the month!) as yours truly...ah
the marvel of life...actially there seemed to be a lot of fascinating stuff
going on in NY as advertised in the Village Voice under "Cheap Thrills" and
those were poetry and other things (like your readings) all for zero or a
donation or $5 max. Good the way people read like thhat: it shows that more
people are "cultured" than we credit...and so on.

But as I explained FW is about an isolated Penis who wages war on Amorica
and spits in the Liffey thus giving birth to an eternal dream and it
circumvolvulates and corruscates like a bubblingmoilby ball who sleepy slep
slops underin Aham and Shem are shurelwoooley ashoimed me goin oi youd bay
creekey ak ka doppldy doo and the dark man  eek to froursome frieghty backk
and doin w' ga t' gang in traumysidey: hey!
doo.    Roichaoisrd Toilloioiioyyyiuoiurrrar

Actually some of it is quite funny.  This comes out if you ghear it read
aloud by somoene who gets it.  I have a tape with two episodes from
Finnegan's Wake on it and listening to the tape you could swear it makes
perfect sense because your ear tricks your brain into understanding.  Also,
there is no law against a book bbeing difficult.  It is whenb a minor book
by a minor author is extremely difficult that we have a right to complain
(somehow this ios only true in prose, not in poetry; society allows you to
write arbitrarily difficult poetry and get awayt with it, even if you are a
minor poet).  If _I_ wrote a novel as incom[prehensible as Finnegan's Wake
it wouldn't get published and if by some miracle it did, people would have a
right to be annoyed, since I'm a nobody.  But Joyce had written Ulysses
which is Portrait of the Artist of a Young Man (which itself is Dubliners on
steroids) on stereoids and FW is Ulysses on steroids...  He made a steady
progression against narrative, for allusive open texts with multiplae
meanings, multiple puns, muyupltiple chracaters who have many guises (like
the way Anna Livia is the river Liffey).

I have not read it fully eaither.  But I find a random page or two to be
quite inspiring and it can shake me into writing.  In fact I write this as a
result of reading Finnegan's Wake:

Reflections While Reading Finnegan’s Wake in the Hospital
In a Room With An Old Lady Who Ate Only Burnt Toast

        Here in the holly holy holspitall they pokety poke poke the bloody bodies
of the impatient patients pointedly.  Pilly pill pills pushed into dry pasty
throats and oats with glue re-served at breakfast not too fast after and
past the waking time when they come and squeeze sphygmomometers around your
no longer sleeping and weeping arm so no harm can come except the times
times times when they are busily igsnoring the increasingly impatient
patients with their painful pains and aching headaches and palpating
palpitations and attacks of the heart and strokes of strokes and seizeful
seizures while the nursely nurses burn toast for a leetle old lady with
colic who asks often often for burnt toast burnt in the microwave which can’
t burn toast without making it dryasdust solid hardasarock crust of fake
toast which is exactamente what the colicky old lady desires and so the
nurses nurses are busy burning bread and the impatient patients are dying
dying and the fire alarm is bring tringety ringing for the burning burning
toast is flaming and smoke is blowing and the nursely nurse supervisoress
says don’t burn toast in the wavy wavy microwave because if the BIG fire
alarm blang clangily goes off there’ll be boiling burning hell to pay for
the burning toast and we’ll have to shove push move the impatient patients
who are sick sick sick and might puke puke puke if we unsettle their tummies
and then we’ll have to send the mopsters to mop the floor and there’ll be
odorous smelly stinks while they belatedly delay and the impatient patients
could slip on the vomit and break their creaky hips and there would be
neggily gents suits and leetle nasty lawyers and we’d get fired fired so
please please don’t burn toast in the microwave any more.

I have only read parts of Finnegan's wake or should I say Vinegar's cake
I found it incredibly dry, and what on earth did the author intend to
do by writing a book that was not very understandable by the majority
of us! We shouldn't have to take school lessons in order to understand
joyce's writing.

hmmm. it sounds like buffy the vampire slayer.

like in season three when buffy has a dream in which
faith says cryptically to her. "counting down from
7-3-0" and of course two years later (7-3-0 get it?)
buffy's dead.

(oh she doesn't stay dead, don't worry--)

It's very interesting to me that Tom picked up on the last line of my piece
-I'm looking to poetics-.Ted Berrigan used to recommend eliminating the last
line of a poem if there was any sense of discomfort about a poem as a whole.
In this last line I was consciously trying to echo the last line of one of
Barrett's postings on -content- "I return to the question of content." I
thought of a few variations and came up with this one. It was 4 am and I
wanted to get the posting out- but I admit I was quite tired as I had been
working on the post for 6 hours straight at that point. Still, I think I can
justify it in that I was not speaking so much about my own practice of
poetics but the practice as a whole, the poetics list being one very good
example of this practice. But I think Tom is right to specify narcissism as
a crucial issue for the poet. It is important to underline in this context
that there are both productive and unproductive aspects of narcissism. I
sometimes use the comparison of cholesterol when I am thinking of
narcissism. There is "good cholesterol" and "bad cholesterol", the HDL and
the LDL.  Good narcissism is the ability of the self-or a community- to feed
back credit which is earned and appropriate in a self-assessment of one's
accomplishments and failings or areas of needed improvement. Bad narcissism
is when the system short-circuits and no amount of credit, internal or
external serves an actual sense of a more or less accurate self-assessment.
With bad narcissism the process of creating self-esteem becomes an end in
itself, not as a balancing of assessments that come by way of others or the
self, towards a rough and ready, but generally accurate view of movement
towards one's goals, or the benefits of one's activities in terms of overall
goals of a community. In my posting I was trying to specify some of these
issues as they were emerging in the discussion of -Material- for poetry. In
Tom's post, I got the feeling in the discussion of the artist statements of
-Home Sonorus- and I'm not familiar with these- he was recommending
particular content as a way of dealing with this issue. In my piece I was
speaking about the value of response by poets about poets and poetry, moving
towards the accumulation of generally useful theoretical concepts, that is
poetics, as one way of dealing with the problems of narcissism for the poet
which I am claiming are intrinsic to the community situation of the poet,
not a result of the shortcomings of individual poets. I feel the situation
of the contemporary poet intensifies narcissistic issues to a very painful
degree for many and that poetics, that is, a community focusing on the
problems of response and credit is very valuable activity for all concerned.
A comparison might be made with psychoanalysis having to do with theory.
Freud offered an excellent theoretical framework for discussions among
psychoanalysts that helps move analysts away from arguing so much about who
has accomplished more with analysands rather than what underlying
assumptions or overall practices related to these assumptions have been
effective. This was in the face of endless splits which where happening as
the field emerged, the temptation for individuals to present the
effectiveness of forms of therapy related largely to themselves so that
individual anlysts might increase the numbers of their followers. On the
whole I feel it was and is the effectiveness of the analytic community's
ongoing discussion of psychoanalytic theory  which has held the movement
together and has sgiven it some ideals to work towards, as well as some
basic concepts to employ in common- the unconscious, transference, and
narcissism to name a few. But I don't want to overemphasize the comparison.
There are many things very different about psychoanalysis and poetry also. I
like these differences, so that I am not particularly attracted to
approaches like -poetry therapy- for example.  There are poetic aspects of
psychoanalysis and therapeutic aspects of poetry, but I say- vive la
differance! as well. There is much else of value in Tom's response- his
discussion of -institutional sclerosis- is also intriguing  as well as the
self focus of the typical workshop poem.

the Joyce recording is of the opening section of 'Anna Livia Plurabelle'. It
is magnificent, as are sections of the Wake. But overall ....

what hasn't been mentioned here is Lucia, whose illness was behind Joyce's
desire to write The Ultimate Book. I'm a great fan of JJ, but FW I regard as
the waste of a stupendous talent. It will always have a cult status, but
that's all.

Listees All.  I heard, briefly, Joyce reading from it on an old recording:
it came "alive", it was magical: in fact I would love to hear that record
entire as that is the only way I'll probably ever read it....but have only
read about 10 pages of it: its a garagntuan "failure" if it is. I, too, have
no idea what its about and could only find out by reading "around" it:
however i heard somewhere that Joyce recommended people to treat it as a
kind of gigantic poem and not worry about ist "meaning" per se....its the
magic of the words and so on, the music that matters, its apparently  the
dream of an Earwig who lived in a gold mine and had an ioslated Penis and is
god and the devil and is also all human thoughts and a river of spume and
love and fear and fire and so on sonos scrunched into the letter c: i think
that sums it up but else I'm baffled......Nothing is a failure, I mean the
concept of failure is subjective except one might say that the guy who built
the original Firth bridge "failed" in that task: HE himself wasnt a failure
even though his bridge "failed", it sheared off and collapsed one night in a
storm  with a train going over it  and all these Scottish fuckers drowned
etc so he committed suicide: as long as Joyce got his jollies from writing
F.W. and Alan's father can read it twice well and good and others get
pleasure and so on its "good", better to write "Finnegans Wake" than to
drink yourself to death I suppose. Joyce knew too much which is why he kept
clear of the mafia: he he...Richard

there were several interesting "time" episodes in the
new Star Trek.

one called "Yesterday's Enterprise" creates a whole
new reality because of an event which changes in the
past: in the new reality, formerly dead crew members
are alive, the Federation is still at war with old
enemies, etc.

very strange.

in another, "Time's Arrow" Data's dismembered head is
excavated in San Francisco. it's been there for nearly
500 years! the crew finds a portal and goes back to SF
of the 19th century. Not only is an Guinan--hundreds
of years older than the other crew members--there as a
young woman, but her best friend is Samuel Clemens.

in one which title I forget, the Enterprise is forced
to relive the same 36 hours (in show time, it's the
same ten minutes...replays six times) which in each
case results in the Enterprise's destruction. as the
timeline unfolds each time, the crew members slowly
figure out what's happening and try to avoid the same
fate. my favorite part of this is that there are
*certain* things that happen *each* time no matter how
one tries to avoid it: for example, Dr Crusher knocks
over her glass and breaks it. in the final timeline,
with insinctual memory she places the glass on her
desk instead of her nightstand. but she still knocks
it off the table as she rushes out of the cabin.

then there are several that involve shifting
realities: in one Worf skips across variant timelines.
in one he is married to Deanna Troi, in another the
captain has been dead for many years, etc.

of course in the famous last episode, the all powerful
Q takes Picard to three different points in his life
to try to undo a mistake--interesting because it
points to multiple causes of any effect. and in this
case, the *effect* lies in the past, the *cause* in
the future. there's a cute part in the beginning where
Data is playing poker with holographic images of
Stephen Hawking, Albert Einstein, and Isaac Newton--

Ok. I'm a big nerd.

a quick note to say that in spite of my necessarily cursory reading

Steven and all,

Consider Twain's Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Bellamy's
Looking Backward, HG Wells, and of course a whole range of films (Back to
the Future, for example).  However, I think one crucial text that no course
as you describe should be without is The Book of Revelation.  Crazy John
from Patmos sets the basis for Western notions of time -- linear and
veering off at a right angle (instead of cyclical or circular), telos, and
able to be "read."  Of all books it perhaps has done the most to stamp the
notions of beginning and end into consciousness: the end is near, and out
of the happy cataclysm comes the new, true beginning.  I can hardly wait.

        Hi Derek,

        If you want fun weeding through information and trying to make a connection
try Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow. You'll either love it or it'll drive you
insane. If the later throw it at a wall before page 400 and you might make
it out in one piece :)

Nick,

The basic question to me here is which community is doing the "feeding back."
Is it one's friends, is it a publisher waiting for the poems to publish them,
is it an institutional milieu like a university or even a poetic list like
this?

Since, except for a very few poets or few occasions, no publisher is waiting
on the sidelines or even interested friends, the process of writing
(creation) essentially occurs prior to a "feeding back," is split apart from
it. This has crucial consequences. To me writing poetry in America is like
bad, not good cholasterol. This defines its radical essence. An American poem
is not really a product (its actvity is not "productive narcissism"), but an
excessive consumption, a compulsive narcissistic act which creates the
momentary illusion of power, infused with an aura of failure  (I *play* at
riches..." E. Dickinson). This aura of failure -inherent in the status of the
American poem- decouples it from the economic (productive) system surrounding
it, potentially becomes a counter system, the counter vision to it. Bad
narcissism in poetry may be a very liberating thing. I discuss this idea in
detail in my essay, "Is Poetry a Job, Is a Poem a Product?" which Gary
Sullivan's Read Me published about a year ago. A poem/translation of mine,
"souljam," which some of you may know, embody this idea in a poem.

Of course, this view of the American poem makes the position of the American
poet, as a human being, in America very difficult and painful; but
potentially liberating.

Steve Shoemaker asks for recommendations of works featuring time: John Donne's "A Lecture Upon the Shadow" exquisitely evokes a world outside of time possible only to true lovers, even if one of them is pompously confident in the right to lecture the other one.

Also...consider Ronald Johnson's "Sweet Orange, Sour, Osage & Mock Orange",
where he gives us the possibility to imagine how the perspective we held
some two hundred years ago would view what we are now. How it gives us the
opportunity to imagine how we would view some two hundred years hence. This
ability to make a poem isolated outside our present means that whatever we
do in the present can be tempered not only by Johnson's reading of William
Bartram in his past, present and conception of a future, but also by our own
acts of present, past and conceivable future. In short, the poem transcends
the immediate...time/space traveling.

Anyone who takes it up can overcome the limited space-and-time perceptions
of creatures such as Bartram's alligators. It is, in fact, Johnson's, and by
turns, our means of breaking through the space/time barrier. The poem allows
us also to be able to inhabit simultaneously the past (through legend,
traditions and formal record), the present and the future (by means of
declared ideal, projects and anticipations).

Poetry can be that aporetic space between time periods and those filling
them. The call and response across the abyss, prolongs -- for all -- this
feast of delight and ash...that paradox.

What about GROUNDHOG DAY with Bill Murray?  I still can't figure that one out and I must have seen it four or five times.=
  Maybe they explain it on the DVD.

PS, does anyone know how to get in touch with Eric Giraud the French poet, he called my apartment when I was out, leaving=
 his e-mail address but his accent is too thick for me or any of my neighbors to figure out what he is trying to tell me,=
 and so I'm missing significant portions of his e-mail address.  Any replies appreciated, back channel.

Thanks everyone-- Kevin Killian

There's Edwin Morgan's "In Sobieski's Shield" and "From the Domain of
Arnheim" (both originally published in _The Second Life_, and more recently
in his Selected and Collected).

I've been thinking about the Elliptical Poets lately. A few years back
it seemed this term was everywhere, but I don't see it much anymore.
So I was wondering: Is there anyone out there who considers her/him-
self one? Or, do any of you consider some poets "Elliptical"? If so,
who are they?

Some poets considered Elliptical include(d) C.D. Wright, Susan

I have to agree, as usual, with Bromige.  A lot of us folks up here

Spicer is. I have seen person after person snap to when they are
exposed to Spicer, after letting their heads loll in the face of
other stuff.

in regard to narcissism, there are poets writing outside the community,
outside any community; there the matter of goals comes into play - if one
publishes from outside, it is often self-publication, and this always
threatens to topple; there are no guidelines, no stays. community support
is crucial in relation to institutionalization - grants, conferences,
readings, press publication - and outside it, good and bad narcissisms may
well mix to the extent that the qualitative distinction becomes meaning-
less.

According to Stephen Burt's criteria, I would most definitely
consider myself an "elliptical poet." A textbook case. Most evidently
so in my forthcoming book, _v. imp._.

I would say that Chris Stroffolino is a decidedly elliptical poet,
too. And K. Silem Mohammed. And, duh, Charles Bernstein.

But none of our poetries resembles that of any of the writers listed below.

Anyway, an interesting diagnosis. Tell me, can I get physical therapy
for ellipticism?

I've been thinking about the Elliptical Poets lately. A few years back
it seemed this term was everywhere, but I don't see it much anymore.
So I was wondering: Is there anyone out there who considers her/him-
self one? Or, do any of you consider some poets "Elliptical"? If so,
who are they?


Some poets considered Elliptical include(d) C.D. Wright, Susan
Wheeler, Liam Rector, Lucie Brock-Broido, Rebecca Reynolds,
August Kleinzahler, Thylias Moss, Killarney Clary, Forrest Gander,
Karen Volkman, April Bernard, Alice Fulton, John Tranter, Mark

Subject:      Location of poetry / location of poets
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I'll resume the close readings on Monday.

I've been thinking lately about the question of poetry's "location," partly
because I'm impressed by the emergence of good literary magazines in
cyberspace, and partly because I plan to move soon to a different city.  It
occurs to me, though, that magazines and cities already have something in
common, which is that each is a useful form of centralization.  Politicians
like to speak of "community," but centralization is a more accurate way to
characterize the advantage of a city block or a table of contents.  For
what people want is not so much to see eye-to-eye with their neighbors as
it is to have access to the widest range of whatever is going on, so that
they as individuals can respond in whatever way they like.  People don't
move to big urban centers from small towns hoping to be part of a
"community"; community was what they chose to leave behind.  Instead they
move in order to have a fuller sense of life.  Now, the ink-and-paper
variety of magazine has never done a very good job of giving the individual
reader this kind of commanding perspective.  Instead, the print magazine
has tended to represent a constituency: more like a small town than a
metropolis.  Individual Web magazines do this too, but the Web as a whole
promises something better, something like the centralized perspective of
the city itself.  The notion of "browsing" is actually quite apt as a
metaphor (it seems orginally to have meant grazing on the new shoots).
Active readers of poetry tend to do a lot of skimming of ephemera, idly
glancing at this text and that in the hope that a particular line or phrase
will register.  It's useful to be able to click "back" or "delete" and then
move on to the next site or PDF file, without having to shell out $10 for a
publication that has the heft and seriousness of an anthology, but which is
in fact a collection of work by the editor's friends (I wildly exaggerate,
but you see my point).  Formerly, browsing was available only to those who
happened to live in places with good access to variety.  Now, though, at
least in terms of poetry, you can window shop from a desk chair in Des
Moines or Honolulu.  I think this is a good thing, but it raises my other
dilemma, which is: where should the writer physically _be_?  If the
location of poetry is moving Web-ward, so that soon no one will be better
situated than anyone else when it comes to seeing poetry whole, then is the
question of physical location becoming moot?  Or is it simply a question of
assessing the location of poetry by other criteria than proximity to the
centers of culture?  Compare the situation of the poet with the situation
of the academic: academic life is unapologetically rootless (though there
is sometimes the pretense of cosmopolitanism), and though this fact may
gnaw at younger academics, the profession as such does not regard
rootlessness as a problem.  Does the abence of geographical specificity in
so much poetry reflect the dominance of the academy?  But I'm losing my
train of thought (3 hours of sleep between World Cup matches...)  I suppose
I'm just wondering whether anyone has tried to think through these
questions in new ways.

Of course, "nomadic" has become a buzz-word.

But--- the disappearance of the subject logically
leads to the resurgence of ~place.~

Put differently: the elimination of the "I" still
leaves ~here.~  Even moreso.

(Lost subjectivity is overwritten by the photograph,
which occupies the same vantage point as the absented
subject.)

. . . Which may be evidence of the disingenuosness and
derivativeness of most innovative poetry ("the abence
of geographical specificity in so much poetry"):
poetry isn't as ~locative~ as reason would expect the
erased "I" to make it.

Or, on the other hand, the placelessness of most
poetry may, very simply, result from poets usually
writing ~indoors.~

And yet, think of how etherealized place is in, say,
Basho's travel diaries, where weather, season and
~time~ substitute for location.

Some of the most original investigation of place since
Doug Crase's ~The Revisionist~ appears in Lytle Shaw's
~Cable Factory 20~ (Atelos, 1999), which depends
liberally on Robert Smithson's notion of the
~non-site,~ and which seems to sublimate the
autobiographical impulse of Shaw's having studied
architecture at Cornell by externalizing it onto
space, much of that enacted by the book's disruption
of the page's quadrants with beautifully done collages
of maps:

     Continents connected, sea-floor cable. . . .
     How to and the glamour of public transport.
               This way site would have
     the broadest stretch.
               Drawing zig-zag brick pat-
     terns and etched street designs in yet
     to be watered suburbs. . . .
               Down at the bottom of the tank. . . .
               Mostly it's small displacements . . .
     Which is exactly where, since maps
     at once crease to opposites?
                Bits thread west . . .
     But the grain of surrounding
                less resembles desert lakes.
     And as surveyors break cloud level . . .
     pressed under a new highway system . . .
                         but the reality behind
                filters you to the Plain States
                                   just the same. . .
.

(Ellipses and compressions, my own.)

And which of Cole Swensen's books is it that has the
urban planners plotting out the park?

I tried to get at this, in the highly condensed,
almost axiomatic form necessitated by the editor's
restrictions, in Fence's Symposium on Subjectivity and
Style (v. 3, no. 2):

"Its only defense, the rooting of subject in ~cogito~
is typical of an academia sometimes lamented as
'innumerate' (mathematically illiterate): they know
Descartes only through his prose.  Analysis of
geometric structures by algebraic operations on
variables defined in terms of ---and here's the
frottage!--- position coordinates (let me repeat:
position coordinates) was Descartes' real egotism."

The problem with believing that web will dispense with
the decisive influence of actual (cultural) location
is that television should then already have
accomplished that tenfold as much by now, but it has
not.  No matter how ~educational~ the enhanced
exposure to literature and information may be, being
in "the wrong place" makes that like school without a
syllabus: web does not clearly delineate its
infiltration by ~power,~ and a frank, slack-jawed
recognition of poetry's subordination to power is
needed for both its interpretation and its execution.

"Community" is also an enemic palliative because of
its jingoism: "community," in the same sense as AT&T's
former slogan, "Reach out and touch someone" (made
impossible by the very mechanism of the dictum).

You ask: "where should the writer physically _be_?"

Personally, I try never to travel, and to stay at
home, leaving half the apartment unused and leaving my
favorite room momentarily mainly only for another cup
of Celestial Seasonings or bathroom.  (...although, to
be fair, I'm doing that in Manhattan, where my model
is something like Raymond Roussel having a special
mobile home designed for himself in the earliest years
of automation, his "roulotte," which took him through
Egypt and Tunisia, etc., but *where he never set food
outside the roulotte,* and had his chauffeur bring him
postcards along the way.)  Oh, I'll get on the bus and
go to the ballet in the spring now, the opera in the
autumn and winter.  But then where am I when I'm at
~Swan Lake~?  I weigh over 600 lbs. and have to be
pushed in a wheel barrow while I keep eating.

To stay home, like Howard Hughes, who had it in his
power to go anywhere at any moment (financially), or
like that other recluse Glenn Gould, who would have
been whisked off to Tokyo or Leningrad, anywhere, if
he relented and consented to perform in recital.
Howard Hughes is the perfect martyr of location: he,
who, as an airplane record-setter, had traveled
further and faster than anyone.  Having done that, he
sort of ~broke through~ the compulsion of relocation
and, by going nowhere, continued that momentum in the
only adequate way.

Location: That stage set of her bedroom, and (everyone
forgetting all the other choreography and talking
about only) Nijinsky's backward leap out the window in
~Spectre de la Rose.~

Travel is a governmental ~imperative~ for the populus.
 Look at what happened in the first weeks after 9/11,
when "the President" got on TV and said: "Travel!"  If
people don't travel, there's no recirculation of
capital.  So, it clots.

The "leap of faith" was not a jump from one spot to
another, in the original Kierkegaard.  It was how many
times the male ballerina, while suspended in air from
a vertical jump, could rapidly criss-cross his legs in
a scissoring motion before again touching ground.

My advice to a young poet: if your bed frame is not
high enough, raise it on dictionaries or
encyclopedias, and lie underneath the mattress with
weeks' supply of snack packets and bottled water.

~Go~ somewhere?!  Indeed.  "I really have to go" is an
idiom for needing to visit the bathroom.

DIVE THROUGH SPREAD LEGS


[Nikuko and I practice every day. We have much fun. Our legs open wide. We
are up-side-down. We await our dive for each other. The dive is aerial
dive.. We look down deep into new space. We look towards back of other
then down of other then forward of other. Here is following description.]

[First, we must smile greatly at following description. We prepare by
happy smile to fall across each other hole. We have steam-hole, geyser-
hole. We look down with 10x tele-micro-scope. It is very beautiful in
pink-brown color.]

[Why we speak this way. We seduct you with foreign language. We write in
foreign language. You can hear us. You think you understand. You pay to
watch DIVE THROUGH SPREAD LEGS.]

"No. 1, standing at the end of a row of mats, does a Headstand, and, when
the balance is gained, straddles the legs wide sideward. No. 2, the diver,
runs forward and upon reaching No. 1, springs from both feet and dives
through the spread legs, finishing in a Forward Roll." [We read from
wonderful stunting and tumbling book. We add No. 3, diving No. 1 and No.
2. We have many diver standing spread legs in long stunt and tumbling

[You are attracted to "Political Economy of The Teaching of Stunts and

Intriguing essay, Murat. http://home.jps.net/~nada/murat1.htm , I particularly like "The poem ceases to be the end product, but becomes the process."  One of your peice's virtues for me is that it brings some interesting ripples into the discussion here and moves it beyond the usual Anglo-Acad-Web-Have realm of discourse.  I've cc'd this note to poetryetc as there is currently a discussion there of this issue that I think Chris kicked off.

Nick, to clarify things somewhat I hope it is this process that I was trying to get at with the poetry - therapy analogy - people are so easily put off by the thought of conjoining them in this way, probably by the history of poetry therapy.  Perhaps a more appropriate phrasing would be 'poetry as therapy' or 'poetry as process'.  Using myself as example (narcissist on top of narcissist!) I find that the struggle to put 'things' into words for a therapist is akin to the struggle to get them 'into' a poem.

_Homo Sonorus_ is a Russian/English compendium of international sound/performance poets' statements put together by Dmitri Bulatov with 4 cds that sadly does not seem to be as readily available as it deserves.

I've been informed by Mez bc by the way that "institutional sclerosis" originated with Carolyn Guertin and not her by the way - the more I hear or see this phrase, the more enamored I become.

David. I dont know enough: arent you getting into the area of why one writes
and what is greatness? What is a waste? A waste of time? Can  it be wasted:
that said I know a bit about his daughter and that tragedy...well I think
that that leads into - or back around to questions of artitsic orientation -
I mean is Geofffrey Hill a greater writer than eg Caarla Harryman or is
Robert Lowell the man or the so called Confessionals: and what about Baxter
of NZ as you mentioned is he more /less important than our own Wystan or
Michelle Leggott  (who in many ways also involves her own life (the tragedy
of coming blindness)) which poets are morally ethically and or aesthetically
"correct" : am I right to claim I'm that I am one of the world's greatest
poets? Obviously Joyce in terms of intelligence and so on and knowledge is a
milion miles from me: but is  his Finnegan's Wake"better" than  Blake's
"Tyger" or Browning's "The Bishop Orders His Tomb..."?  You'er implying that
maybe Joyce could have 'saved' himsef and his daughter (that's what someone
_like_  (not as dark perhaps but someone serious and morral and religious))
or as Eliot or Hill or even Auden at his most "ethical" might say: I think
Joyce was aware of one thing: the terribleness of his
ethical-religious-moral-philosophical stance as in Ulyssees when it is
mentioned he has refused to pray etc for and with his mother in the Catholic
or even any Christian or religious way when she was dying: how could his
writings have been more "useful" ...I just ask these questions: I know what
you are saying...the hype around Joyce conceals the man and maybe his own
desire for "immortality" distorted him: and possibly it all greatly affected
his daughter...but who knows...we are assuming then the greater importance
of autiobiography....
  To switch I think your (dismissal?) of certain Langos maybe unfair eg
looking at Nick Piombino his book I'm reading deals with some difficult
issues of
I'd say sincerity in writing, authority and authorship, what we are allowed
to write - either satirically but the satire slides and we realise that it
reflects a real difficulty of any writer (I'm taking about his "Manifestoes"
which are also humorous on one level) the raison d'etre of writting...maybe
more so than Joyce whose FW is very much as vast mind map: a waste of time?
I "wasted time and now doth time waste me" (Rich II) But what is a waste:
what should he have written: maybe his life and his writing,maybe none of it
could have changed his daughter's..the tragedy of that: but I feel the moral
urgency: moral urgency is a phrase I wouldnt have used even fairly
recently...think of it as a model of the most complex entity in the
universe: the human brain/mind..but I havent read much of FW..but I'm glad
of Joyce: look Joyce had a comic sense: that's what saves him: that adds or
is part of his greatness: we can be comfortable with someone who "sees
himself" (despite maybe  his major ego) as against the great poet Geoffrey
Hill who is so dark, so seemingly hummourless:  "God is distant, difficult"
he says somewhere...true: but Joyce can say "the snot green sea" and so on.
Richard (slighty ale inspired) Taylor.

To Derek: no I think I can only get two thru to the list its discrimination
against mad Kiwis:very unfair...

the discussion of place/location seems especially crucial to me and I
just wanted to take exception with some of what has been said here.
First of all, if it takes losing sleep in order to lose the "train of
thought," then I want to advocate a kind of sleeplessness as a means
of escaping the singular avenue of exploration that trains and their
"tracks" seem to engender.  Losing one's train of thought seems like
an important move, one that liberates an argument from the monomania
of what gets called "academic" argumentation. And I want to bracket
that right away, since the construction of such a sense of what
constitutes "academic" is part of the issue here. But if course a
singular train of thought is only a feature of the worst academic
writing. I can remember in college how my friends and I used to make
fun of our professors for requiring us to only write about "one
thing" and "sticking to it" -- like some admonition to death til us
part, no matter how bad it gets -- it seemed to me then and still
does that such singularity really very upsetting. So, getting off
track, as I am here, since I want to write about place. Tangents,
derailments, disasters and accidents -- the trainwreck as analog for
the kind of writing I want to do, perhaps -- seems more appropriate.

In any case, place, location, etc. This is an interesting place to be
thinking about poetry, and I want to return to Juliana's book, which
gets posed as being "without" in terms of its placement in Hawaii --
supposing that the author was living in Hawaii when the book was
written and therefore the absence of meaningful engagement with the
place is noticeable. I need to go back to the archive and redress how
it reads, so I don't want to make really any claims about it, but it
seems to me that such a claim about Peter O'Leary -- who presumably
writes about Chicago, therefore, or somehow embodies such a sense of
location in the poetry (though this is something I'd like to see for
myself, since I've long been an admirer of Peter and find him to be
one of the most interesting people I've ever met--dating back to when
he first reported to me (in 1989) that his brother had found the
entrance to Hell in the basement of a dorm at Kenyon College).
Perhaps there is a significant reference to place in such poetry as
the reviewer finds of value that making mention of its presence is
"academic" -- I don't know. But it does seem to me that there is a
prescriptive standard about what poetry should be that is being used
against Juliana and not against other poets whom the reviewer likes.
Does anyone find it problematic that there is this sense of what
poets must or should be doing? Perhaps I've got it wrong, but I
wonder about it.

I don't know if it has been said, since I can only read a fraction of
what is written to this listserv, but I want to make sure that I cast
a vote in support of this reviewer's work in close reading, and I
wish I had the energy to sustain such an effort. In that sense, I
really have to offer my praise for the activity, even if I find
myself in disagreement with much of what is said. That, like any
disagreement, can hopefully lead to productive dialog about the
issues at stake.

Why are you leaving Chicago? I'm curious about the assumption about
the rootlessness of academic life. While I'm likely to agree on the
one hand, I'm also concerned, on the other, that such a move really
lumps a vast diversity of folks together when such a fit might be
untenable. Again, I think looking at a sort of neo-regionalism (and
not of the sort, say, advocated by Thomas Hart Benton et al,) as a
way of thinking about poetry. In this sense, place is crucial.
Academics play a role in such a sense of the cultural topography, and
often they are "rootless" or "de-institutionalized" -- think of
adjunct workers for example. Not all of them are from out of town.
Often adjuncts come from a local pool of workers. And I like to think
of the issue of academic rootlessness as symptomatic of larger
issues. Growing up in Michigan, where only the squirrels are native
to the "place" -- the original mover was the auto industry. People
follow the jobs. It seems a mistake to fault them for doing so. When
I was in graduate school and job bitching seemed a way of avoiding a
concern for ideas, I resolved to follow the advice of a family friend
who I suggested that I find a place I wanted to live and move there,
growing roots in a "community" (sorry, but I'm hoping to run for
president of the desert and so "community" is the only floating
signifier I can think of anymore). And I think you'll find a lot of
"academics" (teachers of writing, esp) who are in particular
locations for a variety of reasons. I was almost entombed, for
example, in San Diego, where my particular situation came to involve
a domestic situation in a very localized content, a small child,
posed on the edge of  Chula Vista.  Academic rootlessness is a very
painful thing, since like any transient workforce, the shifts seem
imposed by those larger structural domains. As kind of capital, are
shifted from box to box, and unless you want to "do something else"
there is very little choice. I'm trying to rethink this for myself,
since the end of the above domestic situation meant having certain
emotional roots pulled from the soil (or, in that case, sand) and
also a kind of casting of my lot in with the other transience. To
follow Oppen in that sense of to "find a way" for myself.

To me the suggestion that where poetry ends, architecture begins,
seems appropriate. Requiring poetry to embody a sense of location
seems problematic, while wanting to rethink how poetry participates
(not in terms of content but as a form of linguistic and social
engineering) seems very important. How can this work? Does poetry
have to be about place? How can it embody place without simplistic
reference? For example, I think of Peter O'Leary as a Chicago poet:
but how does that work? What is it about his work, and that of his
contemporaries in the city, that leads me to think about this in this
way? There is something "happening" in Chicago and I'd like to be
able to map it, tentatively, much like "detroit techno" or nortec in
baja. I was shocked recently by my time in NYC, how unmarked the work
there seemed by place. But I don't want poems about new york, or
somehow to be simply using the materiality of the city as points of
departure. I was shocked by the symptomatic nature of what was
happening there; many amazing things with a very "cosmopolitan" (and
therefore generic) sense of art and writing as activities. Has the
internet destroyed possibility for such a local culture? Does one
have to be unwired to find it? I don't want to think that such
specificity is going to happen at the extreme subcultural level
*only* but I am not sure that I am going to have any choice in
thinking that. I can remember visiting my relatives in Delaware
before cable tv and MTV bulldozed the sort of southern rock that was
played in the bars -- thinking of rehoboth which is an hour from
where my mother grew up -- and then going back after MTV and all that
came along. The sense of place had been destroyed, replaced by a
generic international style of hiphop -- and by international I mean
bi-coastal.  Anyhow-- it isn't that I don't enjoy hiphop, and I am
actually very hopeful for the ability of poets, artists and musicians
to constitute specific clusters around particular points of
reference, geographic or theoretical. In that sense, what is
happening in poetry in Buffalo is very interesting. The idea of an
urban subculture, which began with certain undergraduate students of
Charles Bernstein, and seems to have spiralled out into a music and
art scene more generally (which was not the case when I was there),
seems to be based "in Buffalo" as a place, and is rooted there very
strongly. The idea that Buffalo is less interesting than Hawaii also
seems mistaken: on what terms/grounds? Certainly, it's hard to argue
that the geology of Buffalo is boring: try checking out the
escarpment the next time you're in a space ship.  Anyhow--

I'm sorry to go on at such length, but for me these posts have really
resonated for me with with what is I think one of the most important
that we face. Place is part of it, but there is more to it.  I want
to find a way to construct something meaningful where I live,
something sustainable and part of the ecological furniture, not an
imposition on it. I'm not sure what to do, and I alternate between
despair and euphoria about the possibilities.

I really love that piece in Minima Moralia called "Refuge for the Homeless":

Refuge for the homeless. - The predicament of private life today is
shown by its arena. Dwelling, in the proper sense, is now impossible.
The traditional residences we grew up in have grown intolerable: each
trait of comfort in them is paid for with a betrayal of knowledge,
each vestige of shelter with the musty pact of family interests. The
functional modern habitations designed from a tabula rasa, are
living-cases manufactured by experts for philistines, or factory
sites that have strayed into the consumption sphere, devoid of all
relation to the occupant: in them even the nostalgia for independent
existence, defunct in any case, is sent packing. Modern man wishes to
sleep close to the ground like an animal, a German magazine decreed
with prophetic masochism before Hitler, abolishing with the bed the
threshold between waking and dreaming. The sleepless are on call at
any hour, unresistingly ready for anything, alert and unconscious at
once. Anyone seeking refuge in a genuine, but purchased, period-style
house, embalms himself alive. The attempt to evade responsibility for
one's residence by moving into a hotel or furnished rooms, makes the
enforced conditions of emigration a wisely-chosen norm. The hardest
hit, as everywhere, are those who have no choice. They live, if not
in slums, in bungalows that by tomorrow may be leaf-huts, trailers,
cars, camps, or the open air. The house is past. The bombings of
European cities, as well as the labour and concentration camps,
merely proceed as executors, with what the immanent development of
technology had long decided was to be the fate of houses. These are
now good only to be thrown away like old food cans. The possibility
of residence is annihilated by that of socialist society, which, once
missed, saps the foundations of bourgeois life. No individual can
resist this process. He need only take an interest in furniture
design or interior decoration to find himself developing the
arty-crafty sensibilities of the bibliophile, however firmly he may
oppose arts-and-crafts in the narrower sense. From a distance the
difference between the Vienna Workshops and the Bauhaus is no longer
so considerable. Purely functional curves, having broken free of
their purpose, are now becoming just as ornamental as the basic
structures of Cubism. The best mode of conduct, in face of all this,
still seems an uncommitted, suspended one: to lead a private life, as
far as the social order and one's own needs will tolerate nothing
else, but not to attach weight to it as to something still socially
substantial and individually appropriate. 'It is even part of my good
fortune not to be a house-owner', Nietzsche already wrote in the Gay
Science. Today we should have to add: it is part of morality not to
be at home in one's home. This gives some indication of the difficult
relationship in which the individual now stands to his property, as
long as he still possesses anything at all. The trick is to keep in
view, and to express, the fact that private property no longer
belongs to one, in the sense that consumer goods have become
potentially so abundant that no individual has the right to cling to
the principle of their limitation; but that one must nevertheless
have possessions, if one is not to sink into that dependence and need
which serves the blind perpetuation of property relations. But the
thesis of this paradox leads to destruction, a loveless disregard for
things which necessarily turns against people too; and the
antithesis, no sooner uttered, is an ideology for those wishing with
a bad conscience to keep what they have. Wrong life cannot be lived
rightly. (38-39)

Yes, indeed you can! You could try an "Elliptical Glider". _Consumer
Reports_ describes them thusly: "Your feet, on pedals, move in
flattened circles; your arms, grasping handlebars, move back and forth
. . . .  Elliptical exercise seems to have caught on: Ellipticals are
among the most widly used machines . . ."

Dear Poetics List,

I've been oblivious to the list for months and months.
Not really writing either. But this morning I started
reading back through and was interested to see all the
mention of Finnegan's Wake.  I too thought of it as a
stupendous joke as well as failure. But then when
meeting with some poets here in Atlanta I was
introduced to it through the ear (I wrote to the list
about this, about how exciting it was).  Everyone at
that gathering took a turn or more at reading the wake
aloud and it was really beautiful and funny and I
loved it. Since then the book has travelled with me or
lived beside my bed. & no, I have not finished it, but
I will one day and when I do I intend to wrap that
final sentence and start over (I got this idea from a
friend who's made a similar vow).  My initial
introduction to the book was so great, it stands out
as one of the most compelling and delightful
art-experiences I have ever had. Those who would
dismiss the book are still welcome to do so, but  I
can't imagine feeling that way.

Sincerely,
M

To Andrew and Joel et al--

As someone who used to live near Palolo Stream in Honolulu I find it =
interesting, nay amusing, to hear Juliana's book (in which one finds a =
poem, "gathering palolo stream") described as not being about place, as =
possessing some odd discipline which means that Hawai`i is used only as =
the site of land issues (that's a VERY large "only" in these parts!)  =
Take a passage like this one and show me how it does _not_ address =
Hawai`i as place:

The stream is many things.

Is busted television and niu.

Is rat and ki.

Is mongoose and freshwater.

Is `awa and kukui.

The juxtapositions of, say, television and niu, mongoose and freshwater, =
are those of something indigenous (freshwater and niu--or ridge, =
valley--with something destructive brought in--television and mongoose). =
 Mongooses were brought to HI to kill rats, but one animal living during =
the day and the other at night meant that they never met, so the =
mongooses proceeded to feast on the eggs of rare birds--and HI is, I =
should add, the extinction capital of the world. =20

I could go on about the local references in this poem--local both to HI =
and to the poem--but want to conclude by mentioning the note at the end =
of it, a note that talks about access rights to land.  The note =
concludes, "A 1997 attempt by state legislators to regulate the law =
provoked large protests and was not passed.  These rights, however, are =
constantly eroded by property owners who restrict physical access by =
fencing in areas, closing roads, diverting water, etc."  That is what =
this poem addresses, in its juxtaposition of parking lot, fence, and =
stream, and its quite literal imaging of the sort of junk one sees in =
such streams.

As for the notion that little bits of pidgin are all that stand in for =
Hawai`i's culture in her book (again, posited oddly I think as a good =
thing in Andrew's post), let me say that a thorough and accurate =
definition of the phrase "da kine" would take pages.  This is not a =
little bit of pidgin.  One of the origins of "da kine" is in the talk =
story tradition of plantation workers who squatted in the fields, the =
better for their supervisors (lunas) not to hear them.  "Da kine" is the =
perfect phrase for such secretive speech.  It means "that sort of thing" =
quite literally, but the best explanation I've heard for the phrase is =
that it stands in for something you don't want to say but want to have =
understood.  My students tell me how remarkable it is that such an =
apparently empty phrase is almost always understood to mean the same =
thing by both parties speaking.  And, when a local gay magazine called =
DA KINE reviewed Lisa Kanae's Tinfish book, I learned that "da kine" is =
also used to refer to a gay person.  "He's, you know, da kine."

I read Juliana's book as the ambivalent engagement of a white settler in =
a place where land issues are rife, and where the culture and its =
language is other than mainstream.  "Main stream" might be taken apart =
and used in contrast to Palolo stream, which is a place where the =
mainstream and the indigenous meet, fractiously. =20

In that sense, the book is about not having the kind of community that =
members of this list often talk about having, or at least wanting.  The =
tension between "we" and "I" is palpable, not so much as the emblem of a =
contrast between avant-garde and other poetries, but as a function of a =
rather larger social and cultural divide in the state of Hawai`i.  That =
Juliana is trying to bring together her discussions of Hawai`i and of =
poetry more generally is to the good, seems to me, but I only wish more =
people understood the local references.

And I wish people in Hawai`i were paying attention to the book.  I =
suspect that, aside from the fact that being an "academic poet" in this =
state marks you as something of a historical bad guy, the title of her =
book, with its "fuck you" before the "aloha" and the "love you," elicits =
an immediate negative reaction, rather than bringing the local reader =
into a rather profound discussion of issues that are in the newspaper =
here each and every morning and evening. =20

Susan, I was interested in your comments about "da kine" making its way
into HI gay colloquialism as a sort of "friend of Dorothy," because I'm
strongly guessing that "da kine" is also the origin of "kind bud,"
exceptionally good marijuana, which in turn crept into what passes for the
hippie counterculture these days as a generic reference to exceptionally
good anything; in particular, at Grateful Dead shows, you could buy a
"kind veggie burrito" in the parking lot outside, and see bumper stickers
that used "the kind" in reference to good pot to give a new spin to their
song lyric "What I want to know is are you kind?"

Oh hell, I feel an MLA paper coming on... Gwyn

Gwyn--I have no idea about da kine and pakalolo (marijuana), but I do feel a
pun coming on between "palolo" and "pakalolo" so I'd better pun(t) while I
can!

Beyond the audacity of the title
the courage of which is heartening
I see a phenomenology of attention
which might owe something to
Leslie Scalapino.

_Switching_  is a key text
in this regard.  Awkward sexual encounter
beautifully parsed.

well i always found 4-33 conceptually and actually
brilliant (especially as performed so dramatically and
by a neurosurgeon no less at University of Buffalo in
fall of 1998) and always found Cage (and conversation
partner Joan Retallack) so charming, i had never
actually listened to Cage's music until today.

well

i can't say more than that but imagine that word in
its water-context and just say between my discovery of
Spicer last week and now this: Cage in a rainstorm:
I'm not drowning in the art, rather say i have again
(like my earliest embryonic incarnation) once again
learned how to breathe water.

get you all to the music store.

Fuck you. Aloha. I love you.

kazim,

today at the borders outlet store i picked up a copy of "silence" for
4bucks... coincidence or chance operation, i suppose.  (when i found it, i
put back the lee renaldo book i'd found in the Poetry section.  budgets &
priorities). both cage's writing and music has been so important to me.

what are you listening to?  i got to see a performance of the prepared piano
pieces last year (from seats on the stage, behind the pianist), so i've been
listening to those since.  seems very accessible to me at this point, the
structures & repetition.   i also got to see him conduct atlas eclipticus
(sp?), which changed every hearing of that piece i've had since.  fond of
cartridge music, too, but that's not everyone's cuppa...

was less enthused about the retallack book, or at least joan's parts of it.
i kept feeling she was trying to prove something about cage's work (and/or
about her own erudition?)... not that the claims she was making weren't
valid, only that they didn't need to be made.  it was as if she was fighting
some "enemy" that might dismiss cage's work... while cage himself didn't
seem that interested in engaging a fight.  but maybe i'm romanticizing
john's egolessness...   or laying my own bias on him.  but for me, the work
is more about heart, retallack seemed to be coming more from head.

anyway, glad to hear you've found the works, still new to my ears after
years.  & somehow, this echoes some of the recent discussion about the wake,
how many folks missed the music until they heard it allowed...


bests
luigi

F R I E N D S

After 3 aborted attempts I have finally completed the beta version of
my tribute to Philadelpho Menezes.  I must confess that I knew very
little of his art & activities until receiving the announcement of his
death
over several of the mailing lists of which I am a member.

I was harvesting the seeds of False Blue Indigo (Baptisia Australis)
that day &  my immediate instinct was to form the newly harvested
seed(signs)
into the letters of his name & scan them into the computer.

Over the last year the intended tribute never really fell into place.
When
attending E-Poetry 2001 at SUNY-Buffalo, Wilton Azevedo presented an
inspiring tribute to Menezes' work which more than anything informs my
own attempts at an intersign tribute.  Also meeting Brazilian
poet/theorists Giselle
Breugelmann & Lucio Agra  at the festival insured that I had living
contact
with a body of work that until then had only been virtual.

Luigi,

Some of what you're responding to in the Cage/Retallack book has to
do with the (at least partial) rationale for the project as a
discursive presentation of Cage's late ideas in the (at least
partial) absence of the kind of writing Cage had done on his own
about his earlier work. These earlier collected writings (in books
like Silence, A Year from Monday, etc.) obviously inspired a ton of
artists in many fields, not just composers. But they also created an
intellectual context for Cage's work both in and out of academic
situations.

As Cage's writings about his work became formally more abstract
(mesostic texts like I-VI are perhaps a good example of this) they
ceased (easily) serving the function of presenting his ideas in a way
that was useful to much of this non-artist audience.

Hence the desire for a book like the one you found to be too often
posturing "against" an "enemy."

Cage's "egolessness" was not so extreme that he didn't want people to
know what he (thought he) was doing. This was especially true
regarding performers coming to his work for the first time, but
certainly was not limited to that case.

Bests,

Herb

thank you for this recommendation.

i've been listening to "music for prepared piano"
volume 2.

it quite reminds me of yoko ono's album "fly", though
in that album, the instruments were constructed to
play automatically, by turning knobs or dials, etc.

Until last about two years ago I hadnt heard any of the modern
compsoers...well not knowingly...I did know of Stravinsky and had probably
heard Bartok...I read a book on modern music ...actually I had heard a lot
of contemporary New Zealand music but I got interested in the ideas of Cage
without being any great expert on him.....I saw an interesting book: it
looked fascintaiting (not his poem based on Finnegan's Wake i dont think) at
the Auck. Uni library and I'm interested in his broadening of the concept of
music and specifically I liked his prepared piano and his toy piano pieces
and also Cunningham: I must say that I find it hard now to listen to Cage
but I like the idea of (what i know of) Cage's approach to music art and
literature.
  Another composer I liked was Charles Ives. Others included Xenakis and
Varese: I have to admit that msuic is for me (except at certain odd moments)
mostly in the background as I'm reading and I even switch off music i like
and read things out loud:  how many people do that. Just sit and read things
out loud : another thing...I copy passages out of books of all kinds..eg
just been reading a book by Oliver Sachs (that guy is incredible to see live
in his documenatries: he's so alive) and I'm reading thru The Orators which
is a fascinating work by W H Auden (first edition) (fortunately I found I
had a commentary while looking for my copy of FW which I still havent read!)
also I'm enjoying Nick Piombino's Book "Theoretical Objects"....I also want
to engage more with some of the theorists ...well most people know the
French and others and even Freud etal as....I think Tony is wrong...to osme
extent  in some areas a lot of knowledge is required t read certian
writesrs: or least to get a fuller "take" on them: I wouldnt read Finegan's
wake witout also a commentary of some kind (so far all I've read is
"Joysprick" by Anthony Burgess...which I found helpful)
  Actaully Iwas readin that and going thru a book on modern art and one
about Van Gogh with excellent repros of his work when I wrote a strange poem
that I later read in New York in 1993 at the Nuyorican.I read it at a Grand
Slam but didnt get many points! This guy (South African - Evert - was
holding the night and he made me wince when he mentioned Dylan Thomas and
James Joyce when I;d finish (I think he meant well) but he was close!! But I
thought to myself: "I've lost the students, they all hate the over
mellifluousenss of Thomas. and Joyce is one of those guys whom they think of
as  'difficult' and academic..." (and although I knew Joyce I didnt know
much of Finnegan's Wake I just took things out of it - or picked up some
what on the style)(even though they were most of them were at NY or I
suppose Columbia or wherever!) (if Evert had said :"very Keraouacian" maybe
I would have done better...oh dear oh dear!) (but it was a good excuse to
read  regardless of points)((prolepticallly) "I swear I had/willl have
nothing to do with the Trade Towers!! It wasnt/wont be me! Please
officer,let me go! I'm NOT a terroist I'm just a little fat poet!"  "A poet
eh? they're the worst -take him in men and lock im up good!")

Richard Taylor

To Derek...what is "snow"  ??  Noise?  Partof theproblem is that we are
about 4 hours ahead into the day after whatever day it is over in the US and
Britain is the same time but either PM when we are AM I know becuase I had
problem "turning up" ontime for matches on ICC (Chess Club) but now have an
iternational time calculator: which Idont use ...anyway I'm never sure when
the "day" ends..must keep an eye on the email times: I'll note this one....

When I wrote that Hawaii comes into Spahr's writing only as handful of
nouns, these are exactly the lines I had in mind:

>
>The stream is many things.
>
>Is busted television and niu.
>
>Is rat and ki.
>
>Is mongoose and freshwater.
>
>Is `awa and kukui.
>

Though I enjoy the freshness of these juxtapositions, it seems important to
note that, as an engagement with place, this is very thin writing.  It is
thin because Spahr works metonymically: she assumes that a few bare things
will adequately stand for the multifarious whole.  Perhaps these items
evoke vast riches of significance to readers who know the region of Palolo.
And, indeed, maybe such readers are Spahr's preferred audience, though I
doubt it.  To those of us who scratch our heads at "`awa" and "kukui," all
these words communicate is that the poet prides herself on knowing a bit of
the lingo.  But they communicate something else, too, which is more
problematic.  I _want_ to read the bilingual mixing as a simple recognition
of Hawaii's heterogeneity, which means stressing the "and" in "rat and ki."
But in that case, why is there no Japanese, Chinese, etc.?  I suspect that
the Hawaiian words are really intended to establish the poet's moral
credentials.  She doesn't want to be seen as someone who disrespects the
"natives."

The problem is that this kind of naming, when it becomes merely respectful,
begins to grant an aura of purity or primacy to the "indigenous."  When
language gets marked as native and non-native, it begins to underwrite
notions of ethnic identity--always a bad outcome.  I pose this as a danger,
not as something that Spahr definitively does.  "Switching," as I said,
works in just the opposite direction: toward generic uniformity.
Nonethelesss, the danger can be seen in the troubling rhetoric that Susan
Schultz employs when she refers to the poet as a "white settler."  I hope
Spahr would demur from such an identification.

As for the poem's treatment of land use, I do not see that it goes any
further than suggesting that perhaps beautiful places should not be paved
over.  "Things" (the "Da Kine" poem) is a better work because it abstains
from piety and is truer to the poet's own quirkiness.  It makes the book
take off.

As for the question of location generally, I am indebted to Jeffrey Jullich
and J. Kuszai for their remarks, which were some of the best I've seen on
this list.  Those kinds of posts allow one to make headway.  On the
question of prescriptiveness, my view is that writers should always follow
their inclinations and never worry about the reaction.  I'm not calling for
consciously picturesque writing, or anything like that.  Write about what's
outside your window, or don't.

Heavens, Richard, I certainly don't want to get into those areas, if I have
stumbled into them. I can't write much at the moment as I'm just recovering
from an attack of conjunctivitis, so I'm peering at my pc screen like
Charles Laughton in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. But re Joyce, and the Wake,
I think the technique he used is sustainable for short poems, but not in
long wodges of prose.

More later, when I can see properly!

David. I dont know enough: arent you getting into the area of why one writes
and what is greatness? What is a waste? A waste of time? Can  it be wasted:
that said I know a bit about his daughter and that tragedy...well I think
that that leads into - or back around to questions of artitsic orientation -
I mean is Geofffrey Hill a greater writer than eg Caarla Harryman or is
Robert Lowell the man or the so called Confessionals: and what about Baxter
of NZ as you mentioned is he more /less important than our own Wystan or
Michelle Leggott  (who in many ways also involves her own life (the tragedy
of coming blindness)) which poets are morally ethically and or aesthetically
"correct" : am I right to claim I'm that I am one of the world's greatest
poets? Obviously Joyce in terms of intelligence and so on and knowledge is a
milion miles from me: but is  his Finnegan's Wake"better" than  Blake's
"Tyger" or Browning's "The Bishop Orders His Tomb..."?  You'er implying that
maybe Joyce could have 'saved' himsef and his daughter (that's what someone
_like_  (not as dark perhaps but someone serious and morral and religious))
or as Eliot or Hill or even Auden at his most "ethical" might say: I think
Joyce was aware of one thing: the terribleness of his
ethical-religious-moral-philosophical stance as in Ulyssees when it is
mentioned he has refused to pray etc for and with his mother in the Catholic
or even any Christian or religious way when she was dying: how could his
writings have been more "useful" ...I just ask these questions: I know what
you are saying...the hype around Joyce conceals the man and maybe his own
desire for "immortality" distorted him: and possibly it all greatly affected
his daughter...but who knows...we are assuming then the greater importance
of autiobiography....
  To switch I think your (dismissal?) of certain Langos maybe unfair eg
looking at Nick Piombino his book I'm reading deals with some difficult
issues of
I'd say sincerity in writing, authority and authorship, what we are allowed
to write - either satirically but the satire slides and we realise that it
reflects a real difficulty of any writer (I'm taking about his "Manifestoes"
which are also humorous on one level) the raison d'etre of writting...maybe
more so than Joyce whose FW is very much as vast mind map: a waste of time?
I "wasted time and now doth time waste me" (Rich II) But what is a waste:
what should he have written: maybe his life and his writing,maybe none of it
could have changed his daughter's..the tragedy of that: but I feel the moral
urgency: moral urgency is a phrase I wouldnt have used even fairly
recently...think of it as a model of the most complex entity in the
universe: the human brain/mind..but I havent read much of FW..but I'm glad
of Joyce: look Joyce had a comic sense: that's what saves him: that adds or
is part of his greatness: we can be comfortable with someone who "sees
himself" (despite maybe  his major ego) as against the great poet Geoffrey
Hill who is so dark, so seemingly hummourless:  "God is distant, difficult"
he says somewhere...true: but Joyce can say "the snot green sea" and so on.
Richard (slighty ale inspired) Taylor.

To Derek: no I think I can only get two thru to the list its discrimination
against mad Kiwis:very unfair...

Aldon,

I haven't listened to it in a long time, but I remember that they
don't perform together. It was made at a concert in NY where they
each worked solo (piano by Ra, I think, text by Cage). The recording
quality's not great and I wasn't all that excited by the performances
either. I'll try to dig it up, and see if I think differently in
retrospect.

Regardless as to the overall quality, as they say in the rare book
biz, a fine association piece.

And I second all of the composers you cite.

Andrew--the term "white settler" is hardly my own, nor do I endorse it as a
value judgment.  But living in a place like Hawai`i, one needs to
acknowledge history as it's written not simply by _us_, but by those _we_
have displaced.  This isn't merely a p.c. move, either, since political
correctness seems bankrupt as a concept where the usual majority is the
minority.  I was suggesting that Juliana is writing from that position, of
white person, if you will--and others, too, of course.  I agree with you
that she's not writing for a local audience, one that's familiar with what
you term the "lingo" (otherwise known as one of the official languages of
the state), but then again, why not?  And why not plunge the outside reader
into a landscape whose names are unfamiliar?  My tone here is not as
unfriendly as I'm sure it sounds, Andrew, but why are you so certain of
being a privileged reader of this book?  I'm sure you'll ask me the same
question back, but it's worth asking in any case.  Literature in Hawai`i is
necessarily political, and the notion of there be privileged audiences is,
while sometimes very troubling, always at play here.  It's why, at this
point in history, writers like Juliana don't get read here--university
professors were the privileged readers and writers for a long time, and they
put daffodils where there are none (as Ngugi wa Thiongo would say) and snow
on the canefields (as Brathwaite puts it).  So, for now, despite a rather
radical shift in tone by said university professors and others, readers here
read work by local writers, not writers who, cough, settle here.  I'm
thinking this will change, but I also suspect that Juliana disagrees with me
(she tends to be more pessimistic about the place than I am).

About that Palolo Stream and those who know it.  I remember my pleasant
shock when I was driving through southern New Hampshire and actually saw
West Running Book, and more shocks when I drove through Ashbery's home town
in the holy land of western New York State.  Imagine what one might see at
Atocha Station!  I can see what you mean by the danger of using words to
represent purity or the lack thereof, and the potential over-simplication of
that use.  But ethnic identity is a crucial concept here, and to dismiss it
as a "bad outcome."  The notion that one can do without ethnic identity is
perhaps more problematic--not ideally, but practically speaking.  You
certainly wouldn't hear many non-white Americans make that assertion without
many a caveat.

The poem may sound like it's written in opposition to paving over paradise,
as Joni Mitchell would have it.  But it's also about native Hawaiian land
rights.  Parts of the state university and much of the airport and a lot of
the land held by the military (and shot at for practice) are actually
Hawaiian lands.  That's a problem, and it's a moral one.  Moral problems do
lend themselves to pieties, yes, but it's crucial to examine them, somehow,
someway.  So it's about paving over a beautiful place that most likely
belongs to someone else, and that's a bit more complicated a narrative.

I've written elsewhere about trying to come to terms with being a postmodern
soul in a location that is in some ways distinctly anti-postmodern
(substitute any similar term you choose).  It's definitely a problematic
position to be in.

And Joel: I was addressing you simply because you were engaged in the
conversation with Andrew.

Need help, I don't know anything.


I don't know why I find the defrag log interesting. Honestly, I don't.
Some of the files held on to their partial status, refused to return
whole, to their clean and proper place in the magneto-social order. Others
balked in general, and still others went along willingly.

What was it about the everglades.mov for example that insisted on a policy
of strangulation, scattering its remains in 17 brutal pieces across god
knows how many platters? And this, in the midst of purity, dissolution so
small statistically that it doesn't even register in the larger order of
things. (Continued below. I guess I needed space to present the file it-
self, so you would understand what I'm talking about.)

I admire people who can read logs clearly, and understand all the file
types. Really, there are so many of them, that an amateur can hardly keep
track. Some, such as .ht, I recognize as a hypertelnet configuration file,
but things like .idx leave me totally confused. And what is it about these
particular files that makes them so resistive? I'm fascinated with
ocgen.log.

I showed these files to M****. He's more of a neophyte than I am, which
made me feel better. But still, when I've fragmented before, everything
has gone through the mill. And this time, look what happens! - even though
I've taken pains to close down all sorts of background processes.

Here's part of the ocgen.log:

[accessutil - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[commapps - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[multim - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[accessopt - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[pinball - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[mswordpad - OC_WIZARD_CREATED] - complete
[wbem - OC_QUERY_STATE] - complete

Here's my favorite part:

[autoupdate - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[rootautoupdate - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[ieaccess - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete

[commapps - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[multim - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete
[accessopt - OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE] - complete

About to commit what? Perhaps to be committed, set-aside? The terrifying
thing here is the fragmentation - what happened, what happened - why am I
so curious - what strange beast slouches towards us - what horsemen, fury,
apocalypse - metal fragment straight-jacket torn in 17 pieces - something
moving in pieces - in the distance -

Andrew--the term "white settler" is hardly my own, nor do I endorse it

_we_
have displaced.  This isn't merely a p.c. move, either, since political

Wrestling with a similar question myself, Andrew, it seems to me that there
are really three questions here related at least tangentially to concerns
recently raised on the list by Murat and Nick - the old economic bugaboo
[peripherally speaking as I write what could be this generation's Woodstock,
Bonnaroo,
is 'happening' about thirty miles away but I fear it will be swallowed by
commercialism].

The questions are 1. location to write poetry and 2. location to be a poet,
and 3 writing poetry about a location - Rapping to or from a location is
covered in an interesting thing on Nellyville in the NYTimes today that puts
it into a techno perspective.

However, I think the relation of 1 and 2 (or lack thereof) is the more
interesting question as it relates to net location as well as physical
location.  For example if one wanted a web location to locate venues and
publish [be a poet] this list would seem ideal while I'm not sure what would
be an ideal location on the web to write poetry unless it would be a
workshop kind of elist but then I'm not sure whether that type of atmosphere
is helpful or not?  In times gone by wr-eye-tings had a fruitful atmosphere
and the rengas here were 'inspiring' but I don't know whether that type of
atmosphere exists on the net anywhere?

As far as 'real life' goes I know there are many locations where a lot of
publishing is occuring but I'm not sure that makes them good locations to
write poetry?

   The sounds were gritty, gratey, because
   I got a herd of cows with cowbells
   and their tinklings went thru an electronic gate. Pure
   resonance and grainy grittiness.  Then, by accident, a
   fluctuating deries of harmonics, so that
   the tips of these waves would trigger the sounds.

    with his robotic sorrow.

 Olson has always stuck me as the ultimate poet of location, certainly
in my lifetime.





A couple of years ago, on the periodic trek we make to Brier Island off
the coast of Nova Scotia, we stopped for a day in Gloucester, stayed at
a beach motel, saw Olson's house, the cut (exactly what it says it is)
and went up to Dogtown. I had not expected Dogtown to be what it turns
out to be - a vastly overgrown area back on the far side of Gloucester,
brush so dense that we were warned not to venture on foot further from
the road than we could see our car without a compass. It turns out to
have been a neighborhood once (200+ years ago) back before the
inhabitants figured out that the sea would be their source of income, so
that once they did figure this out Dogtown was pretty much abandoned,
the houses used at first as a place where the widows could live
rent-free. But now it's so over-grown that one can barely see the
foundations, all that remains, open space as brier patch.

Congratulations -- this is what happens when one is able to muster up the
courage to get past the resistance of one's ignorance and the overwhelming
diminishment that accompanies it.  There's a lesson here for the Buffy

I question that this is what Dogtown turns out to be.

Try Dogtown, Missouri; it's much better. We have houses, water and electric
service, paved roads, sidewalks everywhere.  What a great little
neighborhood to take a walk in at twilight-- to go garage saling on Saturday
morning.

Salon columnist King Kaufman moved to (my) Dogtown last summer and wrote
about it:

ABOUT ANOMALY

Anomaly is a (roughly) biannual magazine of
avant-garde/innovative/experimental writing, with a
focus on poetry in the Washington, DC metropolitan
area.

The goal of Anomaly is to be a means of creating
dialogue, not only among writers in the DC area, but
also between writers in DC and elsewhere. Thus, while
a major focus of Anomaly is innovative poetry in the
Washington, DC metropolitan region, Anomaly actively
seeks contributions from writers throughout the United
States and the world.

Each issue contains poetry, reviews, and at least one
essay or theoretical object. Anomaly is interested in
collaborations, interdisciplinary work, in any work
that is a deviation from the normal form/order/rule
(personal, academic, political, social, aesthetic,
psychological…), and work that is irregular and
difficult to classify.

~~~~~

SUPPORT ANOMALY

Subscribe: $8 per year (2 issues), $16 for two years
(4 issues), individual issues are $4.

Donations are most gratefully accepted in any amount.
Unfortunately, Anomaly is not (yet and may never be)
tax exempt.

Maria and all--

The story is Julio Cortazar, and it's "La noche boca arriba" (Night face
up).  It was in his 1951 collection, *Bestiario,* (Bestiary), which I have
as part of an omnibus volume, *Relatos.*  I'm sure it's been widely
translated.  It's about a man who gets in a motorcycle accident, is taken to
a hospital, develops a fever, and finds himself fleeing Aztec priests,
captured, and carried "face up" to the sacrificial stone, where he will be
flayed and have his heart cut out.  He tries to wake up, but realizes that
the sacrifice is the reality, his modern life the dream.  So it's less a
time travel story than a story questioning the distinction between "reality"
and "dream" (illusion, imagination, art).  It harks back to Lewis Carroll
(is Alice dreaming about the White King, or is he dreaming about her?),
Calderon's play *Life is a Dream* (La vida es sueno), lots of Borges.

Borges has written many stories with time paradoxes.  "La otra muerte" (The
Other Death) is about a coward who gets to go back in time on his death bed
and die as a war hero; "El sur" (The South) is about a city nerd who gets a
heroic death in a knife fight on the southern pampas in place of a death in
a hospital (Cortazar's story has to be partly a homage to this one); "El
milagro secreto" is about a Talmudic scholar for whom god performs the
miracle of freezing the bullets from a firing squad in midair so that he has
years to mentally complete his great work;  "El jardin de los senderos que
bifurcan" (The Garden of Forking Paths) is about alternative time/story
lines (people say it predicts hypertext), and a bunch of other stories all,
for want of a better word, Borgesian.  Some of the paradoxes seem facile or
predictable to us today, but that's because Borges did them first; his
imitators have made some of his insights into cliches retroactively.  Come
to think of it, that's a paradox in itself, and one he might have enjoyed.

This is fascinating...and at an interesting moment in time since I just
finished reading "At Midnight On The 31st Of March" -- Josephine Young
Case's book-length, narrative poem (probably the only science fiction story
that has appeared in blank verse?)...at midnight on the last day in March,
the lights go suddenly out, the telephone is dead, "the road ain't there no
more." Search parties report that civilization, human life, is nowhere to be
found but in their own village of Saugersville. Those in the town are left
(in timelessness) to fend for themselves, creating a new "life" from next to
scratch.

(Also has an amazing feel close to Our Town, which incidentally was also
published in '38.)

The poem's story's town was a thin disguise of the author's stomping grounds
of Fort Plain on the Mohawk and Richfield Springs on the old Western
Turnpike in Upstate New York. (And, to follow another thread, it's true to
its sense of locality!)

Case, a prolific author in many forms: poetry, fiction, biography and on and
on, seems sadly to have drawn very little in the way of recognition, let
alone examination and appreciation.

Best, Gerald

Herb:

I've always heard the performances weren't great, but I'd like to get hold of them anyway -- There is an update to the legend -- according to Campbell & Trent, "Ra and Cage perform alternately, except during a stretch of side B" -- the report to the contrary in the earlier discography is now termed a mistake --

John Corbett had earlier reported a Ra & Cage poetry reading, but others say it didn't happen -- Anybody know the truth of that matter?

HEAVEN
A short story
=A0
by Steven Barthelme
=A0
.....=20


The poet delicately picks his nose while talking on my telephone, his old
abraded sneakers up on my coffee table. This is authentic behavior: the poe=
t
is proving that he is a poet. At least I assume that's what he's doing. He
glances up at me and then continues his picking and his conversation. "...
in this country!" he shouts into the receiver. It's a joke; he is talking t=
o
a poet about a poet. Much laughter. He puts something in the ashtray.

Is he a good poet? He is thought by poetry authorities to be a good poet,
but what do they know? I love him, but this does not blind me to the qualit=
y
of his poetry. In the poem he wrote about me after my death, I wrote the
only good line. He was quoting me, but the attribution was somewhat vague. =
I
was dead twenty-one minutes before he got to the typewriter.

My sister, inexplicably, doesn't want to sleep with the poet, though I have
offered him to her on several occasions. My sister said she'd design her ow=
n
therapy, thank you. "He looks like he needs a bath," she said. "He looks a
touch gamy=8B'gamy' is the word."

"Poets prize that look," I said. "He sleeps with women by the dozens," I
said.=20

"Golly," she said.=20

"Poets get them down any way they can=8Bliquor, B-pluses, enigmas."

"This isn't winning," she said.

"Making up for high school," I said.

Heaven. In heaven no hardwood floors and no baseball, and poets caught
talking about sports get the rack. Yesterday I saw Jesus in a leather hat.

Here is what the poet is saying on the telephone: "... back together?
Really? In Vermont she and Bruno and Tige got naked in the lake and alors,
voil=E0 ..." Another part of it is like this: "... and so her pants were on
inside out, har har har ..." It's a long-distance call.

Here is what the poet says in the classroom: "Be inexplicable, but not
inexplicatable. Be emendatious but not cementatious." (Not in my dictionary=
;
suspect that's a coinage.) "Be abominable yet abdominal. Make it newt." (I
hear poorly, so this could have been "Make it new," although he loathes
Pound; it may have been "Make a note"=8Bsometimes he feigns a boffo French
accent.) "Oh, and see me after class, Caitlin, Feta, Ang Li, Eschscholtzia,
Daisy, Zinnia, Dahlia."

Before being admitted into heaven I suffered ninety days in purgatory, whic=
h
is how I know he wrote a poem about me after I died. It was okay. Some
people get the exercise bike. Apparently there's no hell.

The poet drives a Land Rover, of course. Loves his wife. Rubs dogs with
great gusto.

In heaven Scotch is blessedly harmless, and my back has finally stopped
hurting, and my body's really buffed. Didn't require crunches, either, whic=
h
are what I got into poetry to avoid. But the poet has written, "All a poet
really needs is a six-pack and a six-pack. Grolsch=8Band really ripped abs,"
he explained.=20

"But Grolsch is expensive!" I cried.

"In this country," he said.

Heaven resembles a very large Days Inn where God is always wandering around
saying, "Have you seen Jesus? Have you seen Jesus?" They argue constantly.
Jesus says, "'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise'?" alluding to somethin=
g
his Father said (First Corinthians=8BI looked it up), and snaps his fingers.
"Fundamentally unserious, Dad."

"I guess I should frown more," his Father says, and gives a weary look. The
building, heaven, goes on as far as the eye can see, into the clouds. In th=
e
lobby in the morning an enormously long white tablecloth appears, with
coffee and one lemon Danish, which renews itself endlessly. Angels are
everywhere, dancing.

The poet's life has been lived on the edge, in several countries, in his
friends' apartments. The poet spent twelve years working for the John Deere
Corporation, two weeks in law school in Boston, a night and day in jail on =
a
vagrancy charge (inspiration for the poems, later, in I Fought the Law); he
once played tambo in a rock band. The band got him started in poetry when h=
e
discovered deep feeling and first wore a perm. "Candy from a b=E9b=E9," he says
of that period.

"Only women understand me," he says. With the help of a wealthy coal widow
he started The New Bituminous Review and filled it with uncanny and hauntin=
g
work by the editors of other magazines. Then for three years he fearlessly
walked up and down Sixth Avenue, filling out grant applications, winning
nine. "It's a poet-eat-poet world out there," he says.

They don't only argue. Last week God and Jesus were in the main lobby,
rolling on the carpet, laughing about hell. "Who could have known that
they'd take that seriously?" God said. "They've been worrying about that fo=
r
two thousand years!" He snorted and fell into convulsions of laughter.

"And=8Band=8B" Jesus said, wiping tears from his shining eyes, "and we were onl=
y
kidding. God, they must think we're mean!" And they walked off slapping
their foreheads and kneecaps, and Jesus' hat fell off. His eyes are
intensely beautiful, blue. He is very tall.

The poet is thought to have a very good gamy look, I told my sister. One of
the top five, among contemporary American poets. "His wife won't mind," I
said, "because he's an artist."

"What is his poetry about?" she asked.

"Anguish," I said. "Black woe. Raw, unashamed passion. Black lung. A number
of his newest poems shockingly unmask the pylorus, where a valve
inextricably links man's stomach to his small intestine."

My death came about in this way: I poisoned myself, with loathing. And envy=
,
there was some envy. Mostly loathing.

The poet is off the phone. He has a legal pad and a blue-and-black German
pencil, working probably on "Reflux." It's a new one in the Los Angeles
Lakers series. "Overweight and eager ..." the poem begins. He pauses, penci=
l
to his lips. He is thinking. I ask if he will stay to dinner, and he slams
the pencil down, enraged. "Oh, Christ," he says, "can't you see I'm working=
?
What're you having? I'll invite Peesha, Pasha, and Tony. It's all ruined
now," he says. The pencil is very beautiful. He picks up the telephone.

Jesus comes over to me when I'm out on a chaise beside one of the pools.
He's holding a fat red notebook in one hand and two lemonade cans from the
vending machine in the other. He hands me one. Frigid. All around us people
are getting to their feet. Music is playing somewhere.

"A hat?" I say. "You're never in a hat in the pictures."

"I'm two thousand years old," Jesus says, and pats the leather hat. "I'll
wear a hat if I feel like it." He gives a droll smile. "I have you down her=
e
for loathing and envy," he says, looking up from the red notebook. "You mus=
t
forgive him."

"There's nothing to forgive," I say, and take a drink. It's Handel=8Bthe
music.

"Bo, I'm Jesus. Why are you bothering to lie to me?"

"Yes, sorry, I forgot. Gosh, this lemonade is cold."

Jesus sighs. "That's a nice touch, that 'Gosh.' A little foolish,
considering that you're already in heaven. Still, 'God hath chosen the
foolish things of the world to confound the wise'." He shrugs. "It's in
First Corinthians."

"That'd be Chapter One," I say, "verse twenty-seven?"

He glances sharply at me for a second but recovers, nods, and slaps the red
notebook on his pants. "You must forgive him."

"Okay. I forgive him."

Jesus looks at me with his brilliant eyes. It's the sort of long,
theatrically patient look one gets not from a father but from a beloved
older brother.

"Okay, I don't forgive him. Okay." The breeze in heaven is soft, sweet,
smells delicately of oranges.

The poet wants to write good poetry, I know he does. He does not think of
himself as a dull, careerist predator and sham. He could be a counterfeit
and write great poetry at the same time, perhaps. He wants to know awe. He
wants to have important things to say to his fellows, to make cold souls
warm, to ease hurt, to praise love, to give hope to the despairing and
companionship to the lonely, to hold the breath of wisdom in his hand for a=
n
instant, to add to what we have. He wants to see. Even a blind squirrel
finds a ... No, never mind that.

"Jesus, this is hard. This is hard," I say, "Jesus."

His eyes are terrible.

Marla and All,

There are varieties of literary pleasures and effects, varieties of
taste.  The question is, are there certain values placed on certain items
of cultural capital.  Must someone like or "appreciate" Finnegan's
Wake?  Also, I found the experience recounted here, along with the story in
an earlier post about the reading group, examples of different modes of
reading and engagement.  The phenomenon of reading groups or clubs is
widespread, as are cultish responses to literature (Jane Austin, Melville,
etc.).  Are there clubs reading experimental poetry and other
literature?  If so, where?  If not, why?  Finally, I am interested in the
idea of "a stupendous joke and a failure."  How much literature is either
or both.  What constitutes failure?  Clearly, FW is not a failure, not if
so many people can enjoy it so much -- and neither is the work of
Christopher Smart or Tristan Tzara or Charles Reznikoff or Herman Melville
or . . .  -- but a lot of people would consider them to be.  And they don't
want to read it -- and the Lord said, "That is good."  Some writing souls
even aspire to failure, stupendous failure, and they too will get swallowed
up with Kora, and the Lord said, "Enjoy the joke."  Who makes the rules?

Yes, I did. And I was amazed at how (frighteningly)close in style, theme and
overall atmosphere the piece was to Donald Barthleme's work, especially
circa "Sadness", "City Life"...or even the stories collected in "Great
Days".

Seems to be working the same corner without any new prospects.

rolling on the carpet, laughing about hell. "Who could have known that
they'd take that seriously?" God said. "They've been worrying about that for
two thousand years!" He snorted and fell into convulsions of laughter.

"And kidding. God, they must think we're mean!" And they walked off slapping
their foreheads and kneecaps, and Jesus' hat fell off. His eyes are
intensely beautiful, blue. He is very tall.

The poet is thought to have a very good gamy look, I told my sister. One of
the top five, among contemporary American poets. "His wife won't mind," I
said, "because he's an artist."

"What is his poetry about?" she asked.

"Anguish," I said. "Black woe. Raw, unashamed passion. Black lung. A number
of his newest poems shockingly unmask the pylorus, where a valve
inextricably links man's stomach to his small intestine."

My death came about in this way: I poisoned myself, with loathing. And envy,
there was some envy. Mostly loathing.

The poet is off the phone. He has a legal pad and a blue-and-black German
pencil, working probably on "Reflux." It's a new one in the Los Angeles
Lakers series. "Overweight and eager ..." the poem begins. He pauses, pencil
to his lips. He is thinking. I ask if he will stay to dinner, and he slams
the pencil down, enraged. "Oh, Christ," he says, "can't you see I'm working?
What're you having? I'll invite Peesha, Pasha, and Tony. It's all ruined
now," he says. The pencil is very beautiful. He picks up the telephone.

Jesus comes over to me when I'm out on a chaise beside one of the pools.
He's holding a fat red notebook in one hand and two lemonade cans from the
vending machine in the other. He hands me one. Frigid. All around us people
are getting to their feet. Music is playing somewhere.

"A hat?" I say. "You're never in a hat in the pictures."

"I'm two thousand years old," Jesus says, and pats the leather hat. "I'll
wear a hat if I feel like it." He gives a droll smile. "I have you down here
for loathing and envy," he says, looking up from the red notebook. "You must
forgive him."

"There's nothing to forgive," I say, and take a drink. It's Handel music.

"Bo, I'm Jesus. Why are you bothering to lie to me?"

"Yes, sorry, I forgot. Gosh, this lemonade is cold."

Jesus sighs. "That's a nice touch, that 'Gosh.' A little foolish,
considering that you're already in heaven. Still, 'God hath chosen the
foolish things of the world to confound the wise'." He shrugs. "It's in
First Corinthians."

"That'd be Chapter One," I say, "verse twenty-seven?"

He glances sharply at me for a second but recovers, nods, and slaps the red
notebook on his pants. "You must forgive him."

"Okay. I forgive him."

Jesus looks at me with his brilliant eyes. It's the sort of long,
theatrically patient look one gets not from a father but from a beloved
older brother.

"Okay, I don't forgive him. Okay." The breeze in heaven is soft, sweet,
smells delicately of oranges.

The poet wants to write good poetry, I know he does. He does not think of
himself as a dull, careerist predator and sham. He could be a counterfeit
and write great poetry at the same time, perhaps. He wants to know awe. He
wants to have important things to say to his fellows, to make cold souls
warm, to ease hurt, to praise love, to give hope to the despairing and
companionship to the lonely, to hold the breath of wisdom in his hand for an
instant, to add to what we have. He wants to see. Even a blind squirrel
finds a ... No, never mind that.

"Jesus, this is hard. This is hard," I say, "Jesus."

His eyes are terrible.

Actually, I don't want to try to connect nature and time here, although
I'm sure that wld make an interesting subject.  I just want to thank the
folks who responded to the query on art and time.  And then I want to ask
whether anyone can clue me in to origins of the "nature poetry" thread a
couple of months back.  I missed this the first time around, and have now
tried to follow it in the archive.  But that subject header (nature
poetry) doesn't take you back to the beginning of the thread, which seems
to have started with/around something from Spahr (again!) dealing with
flowers & politics/history.

Any tips on getting back to the source here are welcome.

Thanks,

A couple of years ago, on the periodic trek we make to Brier Island off

and went up to Dogtown. I had not expected Dogtown to be what it turns
out to be - a vastly overgrown area back on the far side of Gloucester,
brush so dense that we were warned not to venture on foot further from
the road than we could see our car without a compass. It turns out to
have been a neighborhood once (200+ years ago) back before the
inhabitants figured out that the sea would be their source of income, so
that once they did figure this out Dogtown was pretty much abandoned,
the houses used at first as a place where the widows could live
rent-free. But now it's so over-grown that one can barely see the
foundations, all that remains, open space as brier patch.

Subject:      Close reading: Lu, "Pamela: A Novel"
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

While some of us were in graduate school being told that "Literature"
doesn't exist, Pamela Lu was writing a novel.  Or perhaps I should say, a
"novel" (since it's actually an extended poetic meditation on personal
identity.)  The book is by no means a spellbinder.  It is not even
particularly well written, though it does have an appeal which, for me
anyway, is undeniable but hard to specify.  I think the appeal may have to
do with a generational sensibility.

Many younger writers are reluctant to lean too heavily on personality in
their writing.  They are reluctant to self-dramatize.  We sometimes assume
that this tendency is an outcome of academic suspicion about the "subject."
And, certainly, _Pamela_ contains nontrivial amounts of academic residue,
mostly of the Death of the Subject, Waning of Affect, End of Style,
Nostalgia for the Present varieties, which seemed so thrilling to bright
undergraduates circa 1990.

I think, though, that Lu's book suggests that a tenuous identity, a weird
sense of being alienated from one's thoughts and feelings, and so forth,
might have more to do with being a member of the Scooby Doo generation than
with academic discourse.  She is good when it comes to pinpointing this
impossible-to-pinpoint sort of experience, without self-pity or
sentimentality.  At one point the narrator speaks of a concept, perhaps
borrowed from psychology, which she calls "tone": it's the "underlying yet
coherent feeling that accompanies any experience and encapsulates some
unplaceable essence of it."  But the narrator and her friends decide that
because tone is "everywhere all at once" it is thus "nowhere we could find
it, point at it and call it a 'thing'..."  Tones are replacing things:
interesting.  And the things that remain have a weird status.  Later, for
example, the narrator refers to their "clickability": she and her friends
are never able to "dismiss the possibility of double-clicking" things in
order to "open further revelations of their deep and vastly esoteric
contests."  In _Pamela_, unsayable emotional tones dominate the world of
things, and things themselves are trapdoors opening into ever more
"content."  Thus the memory of Streisand singing a show tune can combine
with the sight of barbecued meat in S.F.'s Little Saigon to give the
narrator an "insight into the nature of Greek tragedy": "I remembered, down
to its exact tonal frequency, the wail of Andromache in the pounded Trojan
dust 1500 years ago as the butcher's knife sliced through a slab of roasted
pork above my head."  The essence of _Pamela_ differs from, say, its
surrealist predecessors because, as the book's epigraph from Patty Hearst
suggests, the mysterious forces that flicker and insinuate themselves into
personal experience may in fact be threatening rather than wondrous, yet
there is "little one can do to prepare oneself adequately for the unknown."
The book is comforting in its delineation of a generation's weirdness, yet
unsettling in the way it leaves the reader with a more tenuous sense of his
or her own identity, which is at the mercy of an experiential onrush.

Andrew, etc.

Thanks for the reading of my poem. You read it in some ways I hadn't
thought about before. Some of this makes me nervous but I'm learning
from it also.

I want to start with the term "white settler." I have to admit that I
have to accept the term. During orientation at my job here, someone got
up and told all us new faculty (a slightly multiracial bunch), here
you've got three choices: you can be a haole, you can be a stupid
haole, or you can be a stupid fucking haole. When running down the
street, just as I turn when someone says "hey you," I turn to the terms
settler, haole, stupid haole, and stupid fucking haole. To do otherwise
would feel dishonest to me. A few years ago I started writing in my
author bio's that I was a continental haole who currently lives in
Honolulu. Someone, I can't remember who, told me that was stupid so I
more or less stopped. But I think it is still true. Although for a few
more months, I'm a contintental haole who lives in Brooklyn.

I've got a few thoughts in response. They are the sort of details that
I had in mind while writing this book. Not that author's intentionality
matters all that much. But I think there are some other ways to read
some of the poems. And, I confess, I just want to try and wriggle out
of the noose.

First, the attention to collective that is part of Fuck You Aloha I
Love You, to me, didn't come out of language writing. It was rather an
attempt to think through the role of poetry in Hawai`i and the
attention to collective, to community, that is a large part of the
political discussion in Hawai'i. The reading of language writing as
grassroots and attentive to collective was something I had trouble
seeing until I went to Hawai'i (and the reading in Everybody's Autonomy
on these issues is a sort of reverse vision--not that they
aren't/weren't there but I wasn't smart enough to see them in the cold
of Bluffalot).

And the quote that you say came from Stein, actually came from a
personal email from Joan Retallack when she was basically telling me
that what matters was to make there into here (not that there is no
there there--the opposite rather--stop complaining about the
dislocation and make it the location). I found this good advice. Advice
I often get from Susan Schultz also. But it does echo Stein. But
couldn't one read the Stein quote as perhaps good--there is no
pretentious there? there are no hubristic claims of the sort that major
metropolitan cities like to make?

The sexual position in switching is a deliberately impossible position
meant not to illustrate connectedness, but its impossibility.

Where we disagree: I think though that poetry is better served by "part
of a we" yet I have to admit, history proves you and not me right. But
I have to keep on saying part of a we over and over.

Moving on to the issue of Hawaiian words and your second post...

The Hawaiian words in Palolo stream are all the names of plants (I'm
pretty sure this true; I'm in California and I don't have a copy of the
book with me). A few of the words that are in Hawaiian have English
equivalents. But 'awa and kukui do not. ki does not. niu is coconut and
it does (it might be the only one that does). I can't remember the
other words in this poem. There is no Japanese and Chinese b/c I do not
know the Japanese and Chinese words for these plants and they aren't
called that way conventionally. (I'm not even sure any of these plants
have Japanese and Chinese words; they might not grow in places where
Japanese and Chinese are the official languages.) What in this poem
reads to you as "an aura of purity or primacy" is to me an everyday and
I don't know any way around it. It is a list poem in the most literal
sense. I walked down to Palolo stream, a half block from where I lived
on Dole Street, and wrote down what I saw. I guess I could write the
poem and only list plants that have English naming equivalents but I
think that would be weirdly false. (I've written more on this issue of
naming in Hawai`i in the essay Dole Street which I recently loaded at
http://www2.hawaii.edu/~spahr/subpoetics.htm--there are a couple of
link errors I've got to fix.)

The words are deliberately not marked as native and non-native (no
italics, etc.). I wish I could convinced you that they are inclusive
gestures. Rather than find them annoying and off-putting, that you
could see them as chances to briefly touch another language, perhaps to
turn to the dictionary with pleasure, to call up your friend who knows
Hawaiian, to learn about some new plants, etc.

"Gathering/Palolo Stream" is not a complaint about paving. It is a
complaint about the restriction of basic land rights guaranteed to
Hawaiians legally.

It is true, I don't really wish to be seen as someone who disrespects
the "natives." Why should I? Why would anyone? Do you? But I've heard
ta complaint from others about the poems being too p.c. Is this what
you mean? I don't know what to say about this. One of the reasons I
tried to think about the collective and the individual in it (I prefer
to think of both and not either), was to move the political poem away
from accusation. (You know, that sort of poem that says I am the one
who resists the [insert problem here], thus I am not part of the
problem but you, dearest reader, are.)

There are many books I could recommend if you want poems that are more
rooted in Hawai`i as place. I can't tell if that is what you want or
not. But Huanani Kay Trask might be a good place for poems really
rooted in place.

just a quickie for now....
I'm really glad you chose to write about this book.....
I like your distinction between tone and things
and the primacy of scooby doo over academic discourse....

Curious however why you would say
"it is not even particularly well-written"
and also why you see it as having
"surrealist predecessors"

could you elaborate?

thanks, Chris

--As found in--
Pavement Saw 7: THE ULTIMATE ISSUE

--BLAMMO--  a few key editiorial paragraphs

The Ultimate issue not only sounds extremely important, but it is also
where we can historically return to our roots and retell our story in a
way that updates it for a whole new generation of audiences. In this we
can have the I character throw in objects, phrases and important people
which will show our newness and locate us in the USA at a trapped moment
of what cannot be explained. Be clear and do not fear, faithful reader,
Ultimate is here which does not mean the last issue, but rather the most
important, the bomb. For those of you who degrade us through logic, yes,
a thinly veiled problematic scattering of ideas splats here but keep in
mind that is why Ultimate is capitalized, like Honor or Justice in the
1870’s.

....UMMPH....

when we left off, we were making a metal plate to  affix to the ground
for free spray painted city wide advertising when the woman who knew how
to do this deed disappeared leaving us ineptly anchored for such
permanence. The staff and I were experiencing withdrawal from an
unspecified daily consumption of caffinated mints which included full
blown audio/visual hallucinations and concluded with a Columbus visit
from George Bush Jr. (see last ish—‘nuf said—dashing Dave). Shortly
after, there was a newfound profound interest in messing with the
authors subjectivity all over again.

....URRRGHAH.....

Under a viking helmet, after raiding many fishing villages, Stephen
Mainard appears from the appalachians, drunk, wearing a cod piece, and
talking about it to interest the audience in staying for the major
contents of this issue. To disrupt the silence, beyond the baudiness, he
has just finished making an AM radio wire kit which were made illegal by
the Federal Trade Commission shortly after they legitimized the only two
(right wing) radio stations under the recent policy. While finishing a
six-pack he slurs, “Whosoarfart Nautilus Preappleguy?” sputters
“Chipolteandnicknolte” drinks three shots then spouts the final show
stopping slinger “Shitsandfritzandsitsabits” You locals, steeped in a
righteous indoor Nordic track tradition, say “Doesn’t that niggling
nerf-herder know eight is enough?”

While this poor pun would conclude the humeric content of most competing
literary journals, we have more. As a strong member of a undervalued
race with high tolerance distilled (& sold) for generations and a
penchant for products that let air in (T-tops, tanktops, unscreened
windows) Stephen returns— after being frozen and rendered ineffective by
the application of momentary politically correct ethical standards to
the timeless ideals of poetry— he is now ready for scuba lessons to
patriotically stop any Arab looking Americans from lighting illegal
firework displays near waterways.

....KAPLOOEEY.....

Contributing his efforts for the war on terrorism, the editor has
created a Dirty Poem which kills through the use of metonymic forms of
radiation. Born in a city near a toxic superfund site, to a nuclear
family which split, thereby creating a broken home which lead to a
thermodynamic torching of morals, he is well qualified for this task.
Baratier will be tailed by a Marine, as most American Indians who know
codes during wartime are, and killed if he reveals his secret process.

The idea that it is "liberating" for poets to accept an aura of failure
seems counter-productive to me on the face of it. The same for poets
accepting that because of social difficulties "good and bad narcissism may
well mix" seems also to accept the social situation of the poet as it is in
an unquestioning, possibly futile way. Murat Nemet-Nejat's point that "poem
as process is profoundly disruptive to labor, and American poetry accepts
that reality" I think points to a crucial contradictory element in the
situation of poets. One of the reasons why I am suggesting the importance o=
f
poetics in the practice of poets has to do with the way poets accept their
roles and social situation with such passivity. There may have been a time
when to identify so automatically with alienated labor seemed a convenient
solution because it combined a marxist political approach so neatly and
congruently with the problems of the poet. Workers are underpaid; poets are
underpaid. Support the underpaid workers politically; intellectual problem
solved- just plug in the appropriate left politics. But Murat Nemet-Hejat's
point makes it clear that poets are not just alienated labor. Poets have
more the situation of the unemployed, unless they happen to have a job. If
not, a poet may be identified as part of the wage-driven labor force that
they are part of. Poet as poet is left with few traditions to work with. On=
e
is the Baudlairian solution, the bohemian. Read Baudelaire's life and you
find it is a variation of Orwell's -Down and Out In Paris and London-.
Indeed a painful outcome. Another is that of Jack Kerouac. Location? The
road, then home to mother; alcoholism, poverty, isolation. The other
possibility is to accept the traditional bifurcation between critic and
poet. Here the goal is to discover who the "good writers" are and support
them with complex and profound intellectual arguments. Occasionally it may
even be possible to build a kind of academic literary career around this.
The result: you've possibly helped a few writers to give up entirely, maybe
even commit suicide. Look at what the critics did for Hart Crane. On the
other hand, in embracing and supporting the so-called good poets, you may
even be assisting them in their careers. Meanwhile, by condemning some and
encouraging others you've created a divide and conquer strategy which will
be of eternal advantage to the critics and academics, and eternal
disadvantage to the poets. The critics, by definition, are already divided
because they disagree about which writers are good. However, they will
remain in league together because they are are a ready force guaranteeing
with their accredited good judgment that the field of literature will be
purged of numerous unnecessary failures. Also, how fortunate we are to have
them to preserve the reputations of writers who otherwise might fall into
oblivion. Where would we be without them? Blake forgotten, Byron despised,
Gertrude Stein neglected and vulnerable to the ignorant jibes of the
unlettered masses. How lucky we are to have these big brothers and big
sisters to tell us what to read, and if we do read, how to like what we rea=
d
and to know what is good about what we read. What does it matter if a few
hundred or thousand well meaning but hopelessly untalented poets are shoved
into literary oblivion? The problem is, even if you are one of the lucky
poets who have been discovered by a brilliant and recognized critic, you ar=
e
instantly the target for other brilliant and equally recognized critics who
may try to undermine the poet's supposed gains. Now, certain writers seem t=
o
be hinting that all of this writing about poetics leads nowhere; we are tol=
d
to stick to good old themes of location, good old values in analyzing theme=
s
and content, and especially clever critical analyses which will surely tell
us why one writer has everything to offer, while another one doesn't. I
would like to suggest why poetics might possibly offer poets an alternative
to this hopeless, vicious cycle of cultism, professional elitism and neglec=
t
or professional destruction of others. As contrasted with traditional
criticism, poetics will not tell us who the good boys and the good girls
are. Poetics might be able to present only in the form of hypothesis  which
the best works of writing might be. Sorry. But what it might do is offer
poets a way of working together and not against one another. What it might
do is put our energies towards discovering what makes certain approaches
effective and others ineffective; each to be found in practically anybody's
work. What it might do is get us off the endless lost roads of club-buildin=
g
and exclusionary practices, which bring thrills only by excluding some in
contrast to the clever inclusion of someone's favorites. Can theorizing do
all this? Here is where some comparisons to other fields might be useful.
While there is not complete agreement in any field, most other fields at
least try to focus on sharing information, exchanging theoretical ideas, an=
d
pointing to the areas where the most useful discoveries might exist, trying
to explain why some techniques and approaches apparently work and others
don't seem to and how these connect to effective or ineffective work
throughout the ages. These are the magical "locations" that I believe poets
envision: "where Alph, the sacred river ran, down to a sunless sea." The
location needed is a place of poets working together as members of a kind o=
f
intellectual union and not against one another, where they can hopefully
find a way of avoiding the divisive, depressing, rejecting values of
traditional criticism. Poets of the world unite through poetics! You have
nothing to lose but your chains to pretentious and self-aggrandizing
traditional career-based, hopelessly archaic and outdated critical
traditions and practices.

Hartley's paintings are great.  Milton Avery and Edward Hopper each have a
painting a piece there.  There is a new novel out by Francis Blessington
called "The Last Witch of Dogtown," that weaves and interesting tale in a
well researched depiction of Dogtown in the 1800s.  Other painters that did
Gloucester, but not Dogtown, are Stuart Davis, John Sloan, Winslow Homer and
Fritz Hugh Lane.  I am yet to read the bios on Olson, so I'm ignorant of his
personal life.  But I find it interesting that, given that Olson lived in
one of the most painted areas in the US, that none of his old Black Mountain
painter friends came to visit and painted there.  Anyone know the story
about this?

SCHIZOPHRENIC RESPONSES TO A MAD WORLD

Schizophrenic writing is not infrequently possessed of genius since it
emerges from a dialogue between inner soul and outer surroundings
unmediated by the burden of "correct" societal conduct. In the world of
advertising and mass media, the post-hypnotic magic of the suggestive ad
slogan or the metabolic programming of muzak blurs the distinction
between the perceived and the perceiver. Vide the recent Citibank
slogan: "We're thinking what you're thinking." The schizophrenic takes
this sort of programming seriously enough to believe that he is being
spoken to as an individual and might even reverse the syllogism to read,
"I'm thinking what Citibank is thinking." Collected here is a recent
example of an authentic schizophrenic writing. James Van Cleve's Love,
Lithium, and the Loot of Lima is a monumental 700-page work of
kabbalist-cryptic numerology combined with theories of advanced article
physics and a strange obsession with television personalities, Christ,
the Marquis de Sade, and mass murderers such as Charles Starkweather and
Caril Fugate. Van Cleve is in his late 70's (as of 1990 printing of this
article) and is still institutionalized in a home in upstate New York.

 Not sure if this is what is wanted, but --    I used the responses of
schizophrenics who were asked to explain such expressions as "People who
live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones" and "Don't cry over spilt milk"
as a kind of refrain or counterpoint to the plain narrative elements of a
poem, hoping to get across that the "real" story is fractured, weird, a
little out of reach.   I mimicked them in a couple places -- "they lost his
mind out of a glass bottle" refers to the fact that  President Kennedy's
brain, which was preserved, has been lost or hidden.

Here it is:

was wave.  Flowers grew there, the noise

right.  Everybody laughed, and the echo came off the
hearing room's panelled walls like a slap.  One of
the Committee's investigators was my upstairs neighbor,
had the President's shirt in his safe, the threads
still sharp cut, you could see the haste, the way
they'd razored it off

the rain fell out.  They lost his mind

out of a glass bottle.  Don't cry because
then you can't gather your body.  Milk

doesn't and glass doesn't quietly.

Nick,

Thank you for your thoughtful, insightful post. Here are just a few comments,
maybe as the beginning of a longer discussion:


>The idea that it is "liberating" for poets to accept an aura of failure
>
>seems counter-productive to me on the face of it.... Murat Nemet-Nejat's
point that "poem
>
>as process is profoundly disruptive to labor, and American poetry accepts
>
>that reality" I think points to a crucial contradictory element in the
>
>situation of poets....

I am trying to make a relatively simple point. When the American poem creates
(enacts) a counter vision to social "reality" (and doing so implicitly
critics, satirizes it, its value system), this is very much like an addictive
drug experience. It has a similar rhythm: a momentary vision of great power,
followed by the coming down to the world; and the experience (act) has to be
repeated. The process is repetitive, circular, discontinuous. In the same
way, the American poem (as counter vision) "falls flat" when it returns to
the "reality" of the world because, by definition, it is counter to it.
There, it doesn't exist. The poet has no option but to repeat the act. (The
poem essentially is the process, the writing of it, and maybe the individual
readings of it.) Its aura of failure is proportional to its subversive force
-it undercuts "productiveness" as a positive value

It is this "addictive" rhythm of the poetic process which makes American
poetry discontinous, tradition which is a legitimate concept in other arts or
literary traditions, an illusion. It puts the American poet as a human being
in a very difficult, problematic situation. If one calls the poet's poem a
product (which I don't and see it as an addictive process), then he/she is
alienated from the fruits of his/her labor, even if "successful"; because a
critic's function, as Nick says, is basically "domesticating" the poem,
assigning it a tradition, violating, ultimately falsifying the very essence
of a what American poem is. This contradiction is what puts a good deal of
the talk of "innovative" poetry in a problematic, in a way mainstream
conservative light.

If the poet is "unsuccessful," he/she is at least face to face with the basic
nature of his/her activity, though as a human being he/she may find the
situation excruciating.

The poet can only assert what he/she is doing, more or less disregarding the
white noise of critical thought surrounding him/her (trying to find threads
of connection to another poet's activity). Within that context, a list like
this may be helpful, a kind of valuable community.


>But Murat Nemet-Hejat's point makes it clear that poets are not just
alienated labor. Poets have
>
>more the situation of the unemployed...

Or that of a shirker.



Poet as poet is left with few traditions to work with.

Nick, did you notice your references are to "Outside" American poetry. The
influences of the American poetry come from outside (outside American poetry,
or outside poetry altogether, e.g. New York School and painting and French
poets, Kevin Killian and the director Argento, Gary Sullivan and Nada Gordon
and the internet). That essentialness of outside in the American poem is the
great insight of Jack Spicer. The issue of foreign born American poets
relates to the same point.

Kerouak's "on the road" seems like a exception. But "the road" was "sold" as
an odd ball prose piece. His "New Mexico Blues," to my mind one of the
masterpieces of our time, if I am not wrong, had difficulty to be published
first despite Allen Ginsberg's defence of it. Of course, both these works
also come from outside: rhythms, phraseology of jazz.

>oblivion. Where would we be without them? Blake forgotten, Byron despised,
>
>Gertrude Stein neglected and vulnerable to the ignorant jibes of the
>
>unlettered masses.


That's a terrible dilemma, isn't it? Yet, does a poet writing today have to
think of the fortune which might have befallen Blake, etc., and just accept
the reality of their visibility.


>Poetics might be able to present only in the form of hypothesis  which
>
>the best works of writing might be. Sorry. But what it might do is offer
>
>poets a way of working together and not against one another.


Nick, to me the essentially function of poetics is to justify what the poet
has already done or is doing -the poet's attempt to "socialize" his/her work
in his/her terms, as much as if at all possible, to preempt the critic.
Poetics follows the creation of the poem and is supremely polemical,
inventing the approach to a newly existing poem. On the other hand, the
critical attitude is the reverse: one has the poetics first, and one writes
poems within it, often called innovative poems. This is putting the cart
before the horse.


>What it might
>
>do is put our energies towards discovering what makes certain approaches
>
>effective and others ineffective;


I don't think the techniques used by one American poet has particular use for
another American poet; this is a consequence of "discontinuity. That is why
the inspiration to the poet mostly come from outsde -outside language,
outside medium, etc.

This can happen in other arts (music, cinema, even painting) or maybe poetry
in another country (16th century english poetry?), because these arts have
economic (even if very risky) viability. You can make, though very meager, a
living out of it. Economics creates tradition -a collection of works
"produced" in response to public needs. Craft involves a refinement, an
increased efficiency of that response. Without tradition (a discontinuous
poetry) craft, technique become somewhat deflated concepts. If you remember,
in his Vancouver lectures, Spicer says outside has nothing to do with craft.

It was great responding to your post. Let's continue.

Nick - "The idea that it is "liberating" for poets to accept an aura of
failure seems counter-productive to me on the face of it."

But in fact it's that hinge of failure that can be fascinating and
producting; Flores and Winograd, working through Heidegger, speak about
the positive asset of failure/disruption in artificial intelligence. It's
at the boundary of failure - entering into the foray - that the most
productive work might be done.

As far as "good and bad narcissism" - I'm not sure I even agree with the
distinction; by emphasizing "mix" I also emphasize the dissolution or
problematizing of such boundaries. Primary and secondary narcissism seem a
bit more defensible, but only a bit.

I'd tend to speak of system resonance, feedback.

Nick and Murat:

Very insightful posts.  I especially like the explanations of Spicer's
outside.  You turn away from the Collected Works and Spicer's ferocious
presence in american poetry dims.  Perhaps this is because he was the most

Announcing

 "SCRATCH"  by W. Mark Sutherland
 July 11 - September 27, 2002
at The Koffler Gallery

Opening 6 - 8 pm Thursday, July 11, 2002

Following in the traditions of Duchamp, Schwitters, Cage, Beuys and Fluxus,
the practice of Toronto artist W. Mark Sutherland explores the boundaries of
different disciplines ó  language, sound, images and objects. Sutherland
relies on a strategy of displacement in the passage from one mode of
expression to another. For example, his recent bookworks on display in the
lobby showcase are predicated on the concretizing of visual poetry, while
his series Objet Sonique and Objet Poetique transform ready-mades into
instrumental or scriptural forms, and found texts into sculptural objects.

Central to this exhibition are two interactive installations that explore
the physical structure of language. Scratch (1998) comprises 300 signed and
numbered vinyl records arranged on the gallery floor. The word "scratch" has
been etched into the metal master and the records subsequently pressed from
this master; the only sound is the physical text carved into the vinyl. The
text, viewer-activated by an 1960's turn-table playing the record,
translates
as a variety of poly-rhythmic clicks. The physicality of the text/process is
reiterated in the footsteps of the viewer as they walk on the records,
further scratching the recordings, and in the sound produced by their
footsteps on the vinyl.

Code X (2001) is a CD ROM "bookwork" which enables the audience to construct
sound poems. The viewer essentially "plays" a computer keyboard selecting
different letters which individually rebuild a self-referential paragraph of
text. The corresponding sound leads to a layered vocalization with the
computer when multiple letters are selected: a single letter produces a
single sound; two letters form a duet; three letters form a trio, etc. By
varying the density, duration and layering of sound, the viewerís
improvisations evoke a range of phonic symphonies.

Heidegger somewhere says the shape of the spirit is circular, repetitive;
that's how failure connects as a positive to poetry.

The idea that it is "liberating" for poets to accept an aura of failure
seems counter-productive to me on the face of it. The same for poets
accepting that because of social difficulties "good and bad narcissism may
well mix" seems also to accept the social situation of the poet as it is in
an unquestioning, possibly futile way. Murat Nemet-Nejat's point that "poem
as process is profoundly disruptive to labor, and American poetry accepts
that reality" I think points to a crucial contradictory element in the
situation of poets. One of the reasons why I am suggesting the importance of
poetics in the practice of poets has to do with the way poets accept their
roles and social situation with such passivity. There may have been a time
when to identify so automatically with alienated labor seemed a convenient
solution because it combined a marxist political approach so neatly and
congruently with the problems of the poet. Workers are underpaid; poets are
underpaid. Support the underpaid workers politically; intellectual problem
solved- just plug in the appropriate left politics. But Murat Nemet-Hejat's
point makes it clear that poets are not just alienated labor. Poets have
more the situation of the unemployed, unless they happen to have a job. If
not, a poet may be identified as part of the wage-driven labor force that
they are part of. Poet as poet is left with few traditions to work with. One
is the Baudlairian solution, the bohemian. Read Baudelaire's life and you
find it is a variation of Orwell's -Down and Out In Paris and London-.
Indeed a painful outcome. Another is that of Jack Kerouac. Location? The
road, then home to mother; alcoholism, poverty, isolation. The other
possibility is to accept the traditional bifurcation between critic and
poet. Here the goal is to discover who the "good writers" are and support
them with complex and profound intellectual arguments. Occasionally it may
even be possible to build a kind of academic literary career around this.
The result: you've possibly helped a few writers to give up entirely, maybe
even commit suicide. Look at what the critics did for Hart Crane. On the
other hand, in embracing and supporting the so-called good poets, you may
even be assisting them in their careers. Meanwhile, by condemning some and
encouraging others you've created a divide and conquer strategy which will
be of eternal advantage to the critics and academics, and eternal
disadvantage to the poets. The critics, by definition, are already divided
because they disagree about which writers are good. However, they will
remain in league together because they are are a ready force guaranteeing
with their accredited good judgment that the field of literature will be
purged of numerous unnecessary failures. Also, how fortunate we are to have
them to preserve the reputations of writers who otherwise might fall into
oblivion. Where would we be without them? Blake forgotten, Byron despised,
Gertrude Stein neglected and vulnerable to the ignorant jibes of the
unlettered masses. How lucky we are to have these big brothers and big
sisters to tell us what to read, and if we do read, how to like what we read
and to know what is good about what we read. What does it matter if a few
hundred or thousand well meaning but hopelessly untalented poets are shoved
into literary oblivion? The problem is, even if you are one of the lucky
poets who have been discovered by a brilliant and recognized critic, you are
instantly the target for other brilliant and equally recognized critics who
may try to undermine the poet's supposed gains. Now, certain writers seem to
be hinting that all of this writing about poetics leads nowhere; we are told
to stick to good old themes of location, good old values in analyzing themes
and content, and especially clever critical analyses which will surely tell
us why one writer has everything to offer, while another one doesn't. I
would like to suggest why poetics might possibly offer poets an alternative
to this hopeless, vicious cycle of cultism, professional elitism and neglect
or professional destruction of others. As contrasted with traditional
criticism, poetics will not tell us who the good boys and the good girls
are. Poetics might be able to present only in the form of hypothesis  which
the best works of writing might be. Sorry. But what it might do is offer
poets a way of working together and not against one another. What it might
do is put our energies towards discovering what makes certain approaches
effective and others ineffective; each to be found in practically anybody's
work. What it might do is get us off the endless lost roads of club-building
and exclusionary practices, which bring thrills only by excluding some in
contrast to the clever inclusion of someone's favorites. Can theorizing do
all this? Here is where some comparisons to other fields might be useful.
While there is not complete agreement in any field, most other fields at
least try to focus on sharing information, exchanging theoretical ideas, and
pointing to the areas where the most useful discoveries might exist, trying
to explain why some techniques and approaches apparently work and others
don't seem to and how these connect to effective or ineffective work
throughout the ages. These are the magical "locations" that I believe poets
envision: "where Alph, the sacred river ran, down to a sunless sea." The
location needed is a place of poets working together as members of a kind of
intellectual union and not against one another, where they can hopefully
find a way of avoiding the divisive, depressing, rejecting values of
traditional criticism. Poets of the world unite through poetics! You have
nothing to lose but your chains to pretentious and self-aggrandizing
traditional career-based, hopelessly archaic and outdated critical
traditions and practices.

Dear Friends,

For a book of poetry I am currently working on, I am seeking what I call
"assignments" to write: subjects, methods, and genres of poetry. (Sounds
so of like a call for S&M [and I don't mean Sun & Moon]. Paul Vangelisti
recently asked, for example, that I write a poem on being =
lazy--something
with which I'm not too acquainted. I am also thinking of the kinds of =
"experiments"
in writing that Bernadette Mayer listed in the magazine =
L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE.

So, please feel free to send me an "assignment" to write. I can't =
promise I will
attempt all of those that are sent, but I will certainly try to acheive =
of number of them.

Send requests to djmess@greeninteger.com

Thanks.  Douglas Messerli

At the bottom of this message is a prose poem by Elaine Equi.
Your assignment is to write one or more poems using nothing
but words and punctuation marks found in her text.


The rules:

   1.  Use only words and punctuation marks found in Equi's text.
   2.  If a word is used five times in Equi's text, you may use it an
            equal number of times, but no more. Same goes for marks
            of punctuation.
  3.  You may use word variants: e.g. "talked" for "talking."
  4.  You may use word parts: e.g. the "king" from "talking."
  5.  You may not use groups of words in sequence from Equi:
           (i.e. not even "of the").
  6.  You must follow the rules. All the rules.
  7.  If or when you break any of the first five rules, you must
           append a "confession" to the poem you've submitted. In
           the confession, you must explain your reason(s) for breaking
           the rule(s) and plead for mercy.

The text:

    Hi-Fashion Girl

        I'm swinging through a department store of the future
because by then it will be possible to do that. I mean hear
red. Dig the brass section of this cra-zy shirt.
          Wait a minute. If this is the future, why am I talking
like a ridiculous beatnick poet? The past must be following
too close behind. Lodged by the cosmetics like a little
Vietnamese girl with a grenade under her dress.
        I'd offer chocolate but in the department store of the
future all they sell is the potential for candy. The potential
                                   to make Mom happy on her birthday
                                   the potential to look terrific.
What is all this potential I keep seeing like landscape in
a recurring weirdo dream? It must be the reason I ask you to
style my hair, order my meals and supervise the movies I see.
        Yes,
so I'll be ready for the next big trend after death.
        Glass elevators where you really do ascend into heaven
but are kept around to serve champagne. Man,
that is not modern. That was done in the Dark Ages.

Poets of the world unite through poetics!

(last message sent in haste, so sorry all)

I think if you couple this great slogan, Nick, with what I think Murat and I
have been saying about the importance of the poetic process you might well
be on to something with potential to rise above list and poetry politics. I
think it may have to do with location (real and virtual and poetic).and
audience as well.

I'm intrigued by some of the things Antin says in his einterview with CB
_Review of Contemporary Fiction, (XXI, No. 1), Spring 2001:  (33), "As for
archetectonics [interesting wor] ...I know I start rfrom the tension between
an engagement with an audience that's in front of me and an engagement with
some discourse.  The audience is contingent, the discourse is less so." and
much more od interest seems to take it in a direction of musicperformance as
you noted, Nick.

some of this goes back to Olson, of course, and the Ginsbergs of the sixties
and on, and Naropa but doesn't need to necessarily take on that particular
anti dimension.  Having been both extablishment and anti-establishment in my
messy history I am aware that neither stance is particularlyinducive to
productive work but suspect there is a middle or productive alternative in
relation to engagement with audience, location, person, etc.  I know that
this is a reduction to narcissism but hope it is 'good' rather than 'bad' N
Right at the moment I seem to be in a process of buildup of gut feelings
without means of release or expression.

I also know this is an individual struggle in many ways but there also must
be a 'poetics' of this process?

Subject:      Close reading: Moxley, "Aeolian Harp"
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Because it is intently focused on discourse, Moxley's work affords little
in the way of vivid writing.  Rather, her imagery serves the cause of the
statement.  In her work, therefore, meaning is primarily conceptual rather
than sensuous-- which is unexpected given her book's title: The Sense
Record.  To read Moxley well demands a good deal of intellectual strain (it
is like cracking a code), and the rewards are consequently intellectual as
well.

Here is "Aeolian Harp": http://www.zip.com.au/~jtranter/jacket02/moxley02.html

The poem is a statement of artistic commiseration, presumably for John
Wilkinson.  But the style must undergo a kind of translation for that
statement to be grasped, and there are few surface pleasures along the way.
What seems to be an image in the opening lines, for example, cannot in fact
be visualized, because "dreams" cannot be visualized (nor do we get a very
striking picture of loose ribbon).  The metaphor is thus a kind of dry
equation: unraveled ribbons = lost dreams, lost hopes.  This loss is the
focus of commiseration.  When Moxley speaks of "talents" being "in truck
for fealty," she seems to refer the belief, since disproved, that literary
gifts are rewarded with a following.  And the phrase "pastoral lack of
capital in the vernal fervor couched" seems to mean, basically, "you were
poor but fervent" (I believe that some of the archaic diction and
inversions allude to heraldic insignia).  By kidding around with
aristocratic ideas and a Britishy idiom ("played upon by circumstance," "do
take your place"), Moxley presumably intends to honor the fact that John
Wilkinson is English.  But figuring this out takes a lot of effort.  For
example, when she writes that "choice" has become "the slow extinction of
your faculty of longing," I think she is referring to the traditional idea
that choice is always evil inasmuch as it limits the scope of desire.  But,
assuming this interpretation is right, you may wonder what is gained by her
way of putting it.  I am vaguely reminded of Hart Crane when I read Moxley,
and of Crane's own defense of obscurity, which is a strong one.  The
question is whether the expensive demands of reading the poem pay off.
Each reader can answer that question for his- or herself.  At least we can
see that some younger poets still demand to be read with intense scrutiny,
which seems like a good thing.

From Forced Exposure
http://www.forcedexposure.com



Artist: CHOPIN, HENRI
Title: Revue OU
Label: ALGA MARGHEN (ITALY)
Format: 4CD/BOOK
Price: $90.00
Catalog Number: ALGA 045
Miraculously over-the-top presenation of Henri Chopin's famous sound-poetry "magazine",
issued either as 4CDs or 6 LPs, each in a heavy-duty LP-sized box. "Since the end of the
fifties, Henri Chopin, an explorer in the new recorded sound poetry field, has never
ceased, through hid own work as well as through his publishing activities (Revue OU, a
magazine with record from 1963 to 1974) to defend the electronic exploration of the voice
and the body. If Henri Chopin's Revue OU is such a remarkable publication, then this is
surely because it is one of the truly -- and most authentically -- 'contemporary'
publications of its time. Yet at first sight, the word 'contemporary' seems to offer a
rather simplistic description of such a visionary publication as Chopin's OU. When we
consider in the general cultural context of the sixties, for example, aren't all
mid-century art publications generally 'contemporary' in one way or another? And when
considered in terms of most other poetry publications of the sixties, doesn't Chopin's OU
clearly stand out as one of the most significant 'experimantal' or 'avant-garde'
publications of the mid-century? As Chopin observes, he considered the sound poetry
published on the records in OU to be a distictively 'new form of art'. On one hand sound
poetry constitutes an almost archetypal practice, but on the other hand sound poetry also
emerges from the very sources of recording technology by means of its use of
electro-magnetics. As this collection of CDs (remastered under the supervision of Henri
Chopin) reissuing the complete Revue OU records indicates, Chopin's most striking
achievement was to consistently identify and publish the first major works of many of the
most visionary transatlantic artists exploring the new recording technologies of the
fifties, sixties and seventies. Far from attempting to establish any monodimensional
'movement', Chopin characteristically championed a wide veriety of those poets, writers
and composers whom he perceived to be 'in movement', and whom he subsequently applauds as
'Fabulous Independents'. Following an editorial logic of selectively eclectic inclusion,
Chopin's OU records published an astonishing diversity of inter-generational and
international experiments. These include intense electronic readings by William Burroughs
and Brion Gysin; pioneering optophonetic works by the Dadaist Raoul Hausmann;
'crirythmes' and vocalic improvisations by François Dufrene and Gil J Wolman; fragmentary
poemes-partitions by Bernard Heidsieck; high-tech text-sound works by composers such as
Ake Hodell and Sten Hanson; electronic abstractions by Bengt Emil Johnson; phonetic pomes
by Mimmo Rotella; 'handy tech' performances on self-built electronic intruments by Hugh
Davies; haunting tape-manipulations by Ladislav Novak; playful improvisations by Bob
Cobbing with Anna Lockwood; dramatic monologues by Paul de Vree; electronic concrete
music by Jacques Bekaert and -- of course -- Chopin's dynamic orchestrations of the
body's 'factory' of corporeal sounds. Chopin's writings equally consistently championed
the 'electronic language revolution' facilitated by what he describes as 'technological
means which extend the human body', thereby inaugurating an enormous expansion of human
expression. Many manifestos and theoretical texts, as well as original photos, have been
published in a 70 page book which includes: an essay by Nicholas Zurbrugg titled 'Living
with the Twentieth Century'; a detailed presentation of the contents of each issue of the
Revue OU as well as an analysis by the author of the complete Chopin's audio poems
published in OU; an essay by Chopin on the new medias titled 'Expressions and
Techinques'; the famous Chopin's manifesto 'Open Letter to the Aphonic Musicians' issued
in OU No.33 (1968) and its 'Sequel to Open Letter' published in 1982 on Zurbrugg's Stereo
Headphones; Dufrene manifesto 'Pragmatic of Crirythm'; 'Henri Chopin, a British
Viewpoint' by Hugh Davies and a series of testimonies by William Burroughs, Sten Hanson,
Jacques Bekaert, Jackson MacLow; Dick Higgins, John Giorno, Bob Cobbing, Paul de Vree,
Larry Wendt and more. The LP-size boxset also include 30 fold-out black and white OU
inserts (size cm.26x26, or cm.26x52, or cm.52x52) reproducing the original scores of the
audio works featured on the 4 CDs (by Chopin, Heidsieck, de Vree, Davies, Cobbing,
Bekaert) as well as graphic works by John Cage, Tom Phillips, Arrigo Lora-Totino, Michel
Seuphor, Ben Vautier, Stefan Themerson, Richard Orton, Pierre Albert-Birot. Aslo included
is a 16 pages booklet with a critical text titled 'You've got to Laugh' and a full colour
poster (size cm.52x52) 'for William Burroughs' both by Henri Chopin. First press of 1000
copies."

Hey stupid fucking haole,

Ten years ago when I lived in Hoboken a young Latino man walked by me and
muttered, "Fuckin yuppy mother fucker."  I actually didn't respond, since I
am not a yuppy, but I *am* white and sympathized with his frustration. Those
were the early days of Hoboken's re-gentrification.  The following year a
powerful documentary called "Delivered Vacant" came out.  Has anyone seen
that?

Dear Friends,

For a book of poetry I am currently working on, I am seeking what I call
"assignments" to write: subjects, methods, and genres of poetry. (Sounds
so of like a call for S&M [and I don't mean Sun & Moon]. Paul Vangelisti
recently asked, for example, that I write a poem on being lazy--something
with which I'm not too acquainted. I am also thinking of the kinds of
"experiments"
in writing that Bernadette Mayer listed in the magazine L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E.

So, please feel free to send me an "assignment" to write. I can't promise I
will
attempt all of those that are sent, but I will certainly try to acheive of
number of them.

Send requests to djmess@greeninteger.com

There are heaps more you can add:
Serpentine verse, where the first word and last word of a sentence
are the same.   eg.  "Snakes will sometimes eat snakes"

double syllable poem eg. "Silent shadows moving over sticky ivy"

univocalics,palindromes,anagrams,lipograms the list goes on.

I've also invented some of my own,but I will not discuss that here, you do
raise some interesting points though. Keep writing.

I'm hoping to get to sleep tonight before 4 a.m. There is much to consider
in Murat Nemet-Nejat's post and essay concerning poetics but I do want to
focus on the point about the functions of poetics. Poetics certainly offers
poets the possibility not only to preempt the critic, but to cede to poetics
certain functions usually assumed to be the prerogative of the critic. One
of these functions is to create a vocabulary that offers a bridge between
poets, or between aspects of poetic projects, for example, and various
innovative and idiosyncratic formal constructs. Too often, critics
unwittingly look for vocabularies that create divisiveness between poets or
groups of poets. Poets are of one school or another; use one technique or
another; share one goal or another; have one social or political effect or
another; represent one group or another, etc, etc. Mark Wallace in editing
-Telling It Slant- has offered an alternative vision for poetic production
and organization that allows for more diversity of form and content by
particular poets and collaborating groups of poets. Critics are like
frustrated novelists. Poets become the characters of the novels they write
and they want to offer characterizations that will stick. This and many
other traditional critical factors encourage poets to narrow their horizons,
limit their styles and formal possibilities. By choosing their own
vocabularies, analytical and functional, for example, as well as  their own
methods of categorization, poets are not risking losing their identities.
Actually they stand the possibility of allowing for a more flexible, even
idiosyncratic vision of identity that might better suit the daily
application of the kinds of energies that usually go into their work or
their evaluative and perceptual reactions to the poetry of others, as only a
couple of examples. The poet/critic tennis court oath keeps the game totally
in favor of the critic. This allows the poet only two choices. Get out of
the game or play the game according to the rules evolved over the ages, or
in  recent history, by academic critics. What also complicates this is that
virtually all really effective poets are very good at apprehending critical
processes and at initiating and responding to critical theory. But their
internal relations to such critical initiatives dilute and ultimately divest
the poet's critical work of any power, because usually unconsciously the
concepts are filtered towards the vocabulary of contemporary academic
literary theorists or the critical vocabularies and conceptual categories
adapted from them by contemporary poets. I am suggesting that the essential
function of poetics is to provide additional avenues whereby poets may
connect with one another, communicate with one another in very precise ways
about the processes and purposes of their poetry in order to gain power not
only over the means of production but the means of interpretation. They
cannot control this any more than critics can, but by seizing the
opportunity, they may evolve a critical vocabulary, a poetics vocabulary
that allows them to gain power via unmediated pathways of communication in
order to be positioned to be responsive in an infinitely more finely tuned
and applicable way towards each others literary activities. It is isolation
that breeds suffering and hopelessness, mediocrity, ineffectuality.
intellectual and other even worse kinds of poverty. Traditional critical
approaches and activities do virtually nothing to end this isolation, even,
and particularly when they are creating and supporting particular "schools."

Working on a group of works I called -Automatic Manifestoes- I started
writing extended paragraphs wherein I was trying to weave various strands of
connected ideas into an overall emotional or musical string of linked,
evolving motifs. It felt- and still feels- like a continuous unwinding or
melodic -sliding- into a series of related concepts and emotions. I like the
Gertrude Stein aphorism: "Paragraphs are emotional." Also, the long
paragraph shape as a matrix for constructing a more closely reasoned type of
prose poem attracts me.

Failure can be talked about nore simply: what is called "failure" is always
someone else's opinion....the concept is meaningless except innn relation to
somekind of prescribed task: hence my example of the first Bridge over the
River Tay in Scotland: but intruth teprooblem ariseswhen a person equates
say his lack of publications success or a man's rejection  by a beautiful
woman as he (or she in a reverse case) as bing a 'failure"  , a  "loser" :
if one thinks:"I'm not a loser" then one id bsa ically always a winner: then
eg losing a game is good. If you can "fail" and reognise that you are still
a worthy person: THAT is all tat matters...the burning ambition to be a
"great" poet may not be fulfilled: but that is not failure - unless one lets
it: in fact "practising losing " and ten still maintaining one's good
spirits builds strength far more that "winning " all the time...of course
tere are ridiculous and extremee counter examples that only prove that these
are the exceptions to my "rules" or pearls thus conirming my
self-affirmation. WE are each of us the most inporttant personon this earth.

when reading this i feel that i'm neither a poet nor a critic (in the sense
described below); nonetheless, i've got a stake in poetics.  what am i?  a
poet manque whose sensibility comes out in critique (as opposed to
criticism)?  a "fan" of poesis rather than of specific poets or specific
poems? it seems that poetics can be a realm of
intellectual/aesthetic/affective endeavor/play where the artificial binary
critic/poet can be made more fluid, or shown for the convenient but
stultifying shorthand it is.

Nick,

You are touching the heart of the matter.  As you say, the poet, practicing
poetics polemically, invents, "creates  his/her own vocabulary," in an
activity parallel to poetry, because it asserts, developes a counter way of
seeing. It extends the poetic process one step into social context. Accepting
the writing of poetry as process, and poetics a social extension of it
determined, chosen by the poet, the possibility of an "unconscious filtering"
of ready made critical ideas diminishes.

Where I disagree with you is in the "collaborative" possibilities of poetics:
"I am suggesting that the essential
function of poetics is to provide additional avenues whereby poets may
connect with one another, communicate with one another in very precise ways
about the processes and purposes of their poetry n order to gain power not
only over the means of production but the means of interpretation."

Though in general terms the polemical aspect of poetics -like here, as it is
being created and interchanges occur, itself a process- can incite poets into
new ideas and finding their own ways, as crystallized ideas to be adopted and
practiced, these ideas are not I think too helpful. First, each poem being
idiosyncratic, a new beginning, it basically must invent its own mode of
being, its own poetics. Though more organically, this is true even in
different works of the same poet. Second, once a idea is crystallized, it
tends to become a "critical thought." Look what happened to the Language
School.

Keep on.

Murat

May I remind listees that some of us are watching tapes of the games.  The

Ladies and Gentlemen! Welcome to
the Level Playing Field Stadium
for the most exclusive game of the century!

It's the G8 World Monopoly Cup!!!!

No doubt your all watching this on TV, since you
weren't allowed anywhere near the playing field!

It,s a lovely day here, folks,
And this is no ordinary game.

Today we'll be watching the Big Boys play;
the heads of the world's 8 most powerful,
most industrialized nations,
vying for the biggest stakes yet
the Globe itself!

And here they come folks, THE G8!!!

                         [G8 enter, warming up.]

Oh of course - its the Prime Minister of Canada -
the host of this prestigious event, Jean
Chretien!! Sorry, Jean.

And now, ladies and gentlemen, the challenging

In goal today, we have the IMF and World Bank, defending the
interests of corporate power.

            [The game begins. George Bush takes off with the
             ball while the others look on. They try to get
                        at the ball, but can't.]


And its George Bush with the ball. Passing it off to - George
Bush!! and George has the ball and..George Bush...

            [The other players point to George, gesturing to
                     the referee, the UN, and cry.]


The referee cries foul!

Referee: [Blows Whistle, Displaying a yellow
card] You've got to share the planet with all the

ditto:  elliptical seems like a nice term for one person to help him
work out a poetic scene, but as a general critical term i'm not sure
how productive, effective or even descriptive it is...

Dear Doug,

This sounds like it could be a fun and challenging project.

Here are a few assignments I've used when working with students
individually other than the typical ones (e.g., do a cut-up of the
Communist Manifesto, write a new version of "A Modest Proposal," various
types of lists). I don't distinguish between poetry and prose in a lot of
cases, but I've tried to pull out the more poetry-appropriate
suggestions.  I use these exercises to break old habits.  I have more, but
perhaps one of these might help your project:


Write a poem made of last lines from imaginary novels.

Write something that will get you arrested (although I then withdraw this
assignment since I really don't want to deal with the consequences).

Write a rant in the persona of someone with opinions that you find
revolting or vile (similar to above).

Write a poem on different stock market investment strategies or some other
arcane, "unpoetic" area of knowledge.

Write a sonnet with obscenities in all end rhymes (e.g., truck and fuck,
Lyotard and bastard).

A disguised how-to manual about something obvious.  This could be something
like "How to Tie Your Shoes" or "How to Breathe" or "How to Wipe Your Ass"
(no Rabelais allowed), although don't identify what it is, using indirect
language.

Invent questions, but write only answers (and vice versa).

Take a passage from a difficult philosopher -- say, Derrida -- and write a
version as a children's bedtime story.

Write "dam of consciousness": this is the opposite of "stream of
consciousness."  Every time you get an idea or flow of sentence, stop it,
divert to a new direction, stutter.  This is a cut-up in your head.

A prayer or hymn to God -- except that God is a dumb fuck or ignorant fool.

Email messages from different parts of your body (again, don't identify
which part).

Plea for mercy before execution.

Ditto, but using only nouns (or only verbs).

Write a poem of first lines only.

Your autobiography in one short poem or paragraph -- but as the opposite sex.

Never finish a sentence.  Or use only the ends of sentences without
beginnings (usually without subjects).

Take care,

Hilton Obenzinger

I Reply:

True. As any "school" of poetry falls apart (short) at some point, or at
every point . . . (think of Imagism, etc) . . . and more so here, as the
term "Elliptical" was applied from without, upon several poets
without their endorsement. This is why I first asked the question.

And it would be helpful to talk about these poets. These youngish,
newish poets. Call them the "Denver Quarterly-Colorado Review-
New American Writing-Fence" poets, maybe (though that would
make them seem more exclusive). Something is there to link them, or
many of them, together, I'd think. As this is something new, or at least
fresh . . . (so here's our chance?)

Something is different about these poets, and, though I dislike the
term "Elliptical," I do like the notion it carries of logical disruption
within lyrical desires that Stephen Burt works with.

If anyone would like to read his article, it's online at:
<http://www.poetrysociety.org.uk/review/pr88-1/burt.htm>

There's also quite a bit about this at <http://jacketmagazine.com/>
in volumes 11 and 12.

am replying to whole list, becos, well...

For a book of poetry I am currently working on, I am seeking what I call
"assignments" to write: subjects, methods, and genres of poetry. (Sounds
so of like a call for S&M [and I don't mean Sun & Moon].

constraints are so very kinky.  Is this why students love them so?

Instead of commanding the page, the text, the reader, etc., to lick one's
toes, instead of commanding and controlling something never completely
controllable, one is, instead, asked to risk the ridiculous the other way
around, to respond (to form, generally).  Why not twist it around?  Play a
different role or all of them?

at the risk of receiving thousands of xxx e-mails, I have come up with the
following:

Come
Assume Spot / Place / Rest
Silence
Attend
Mingle
Bring/Get
Fetch
Crawl

Close
Dismissed
Follow

as Alan Sondheim knows, there is some interesting crossover between these
and moo / dungeon commands for maze games and telnet ...

Write a poem about a fluffy kitty and a rainbow.  Write a poem with genteel
poet thematic constraints (i.e., a dead baby becoming an angel, etc.).  A
"sad" poem.

A poem that would lick the author's toes.  A poem that would get some sort
of erotic charge from doing the laundry.  Poems that use commands different
ways.

I think about the OuLiPo idea to write a poem that contains your pet's name
over and over so that when you read it, the pet thinks it is getting called.

Be well,

don't wish to horn in on the engaging exchange twixt nick and murat,
but i feel i need to say a few things anyway:  the sort of
phenomenology (and for that matter, model of production, or
non-production) that murat posits is problematic for me in that i
don't write only poetry... when i hear news, e.g., of what's taking
place right now with borders (see below), i don't find the sort of
affective/conceptual recourse murat details as speaking to the sense
of urgency that overwhelms me wrt our public domain (though one could
perhaps argue that the very idea of failure, of whatever sort, is
symptomatic of the latter)...

now there is what we do, and what we imagine ourselves to be doing...
w/o wishing to discount either realm (of practice, and of
imagination), i'd like to observe that the writing i've been doing of
late as a screenwriter, and as a memoirist, and as a poet-critic (or
critic-poet) seem all to overlap at times, to varying degrees...
granted there are affective (i will stick with the latter here)
differences between these spheres of practice, and granted there are
clearly material differences at stake too (and note, btw, that my
work on scripts has little if anything to do, at this point, with my
status as an academic creative writing instructor---which may or may
not be a temporary status, right?)... but the point is that in all
cases, i'm sitting in front of my screen, and typing... we can make
much of how this activity is defined, in so many ways, by what comes
out the other end (i.e., as product as opposed to process---and i
generally come to writing as a process type, even if it's true that
writing a script is clearly a more product-driven activity,
practically speaking)... sometimes i might make much of these
differences---to suit my purposes as a writer/thinker, ok---yet from
where i'm sitting, i need a grasp of poetic practice that speaks
adequately e.g. to the border's controversy...

and as to practice specifically:  i would also note here that the
distinction at play in murat/nick's discussion between product and
process seems to leave out this term, practice... for me, "process"
designates one way of thinking about practice, but certainly not the
only way (as noted by discussion of procedure)... and practice has
the advantage of moving the discussion of writing (whether poetry, or
whatever) both away from more formalist notions of product AND from
mystifications of process (and like whitehead too), potentially to
yield a more general discussion of the conditions, symptoms, and
(again) affective realities of writing (and my hobbyhorse, labor)...

so (if i may) i'd like us not to lose our heads altogether---whatever
the genre, it's still about typing (or scribbling), it's still about
distributing alphabetic strokes, with various returns and whether in
ink or pixel or by pressure disturbance, for potential consideration
by other soulless bipeds (thanx don byrd)... in fact even to make
this generic distinction up-front---i.e., to attempt to distinguish
the poetic act e.g. from the prosaic act---may be more a symptom of a
marketing reality at this point in time (and place) than anything
more, shall we say, refined...

anyway, again, a great discussion, and my remarks probably best
designated as courtesy of the peanut gallery...

best,

joe

So, I did break down and buy the CD set of the Revue Ou today. I'm listening to it now.
And of course it's predictably very good. I'm familiar with much of the material.
Although I don't have any OU stuff, much of this has subsequently appeared elsewhere.

But really great is the packaging - a big book with a bunch of Chopin essays, facsimilie
record labels, bios of the poets, etc. I'll probably end up OCR'ing most of the book to
post on UbuWeb over the course of the summer.

And then there's a bunch of reproductions of artist's pieces by Cage, Furnival, De Vree,
Tom Philips, Heidseick, etc. Again, much of it is familar and a bunch of it is already on
UbuWeb.

I'd love to rip the CDs into MP3s and throw 'em up on UbuWeb but I have a policy
(generally - not always, but almost always) of not putting things that are in print up. I
don't want to take whatever small amount of money that these publishers might be making
out of their pockets. And UbuWeb's traffic is substantial enough that it might actually
take a bite out.

HOWEVER, I will rip the CDs into MP3s and throw 'em on the OpenNap p2p group I'm a part
of:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AudioFix/

HIGHLY recommended gang of smart folks trading experimental and avant MP3s (there's a
bunch of sound poetry stuff there - I've already gotten Wolmans, Debord, Chopin, etc.
tracks off AudioFix). You're foolish if you don't join....

Subject:      Apology for Criticism
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

(This responds to Nick Piombino's recent post, in which he asks that
"poetics" not make evaluative claims about particular works.)

"Poetics" is the attempt to reconstruct the principles of good writing
based on known examples.  It is thus subsequent to judgment.  Aristotle did
not have to persuade anyone that Oedipus was a good play.  He just wanted
to figure out how Sophocles had done it, so that others might do it too.

Evaluative criticism is the highest kind of writing about poetry.  It is
also the most difficult.  It cannot go solely on the basis of established
criteria, because it must also attend to the criteria immanent in the new
poem.  Are those criteria new and good?  Or does the poem conform to old
criteria?  That's the crucial question.

All writing about new poetry is evaluative to some extent.  You can either
try to articulate the basis of the evaluation, or you can let it remain a
hidden premise, one you may not understand.  Pound, for example, was always
yelling at academics to say what works they like, and why.

Academics have in general agreed (for professional reasons) to dismiss all
notions of literary excellence.  They have their own agenda: their careers.
Magazine reviewers are seldom up to the job.  So we are left with a
situation of bland compliments and hand-holding (at least in public).  If
being taken seriously for a change makes a poet get huffy, he or she might
think about what Coleridge says in chp 2 of the Biographia, where he talks
about the temperament of great artists: "In the inward assurance of
permanent fame, they seem to have been either indifferent or resigned with
regard to immediate reputation."

Bush is Irrelevant and Must Go
by Ira Chernus

In a major policy shift, I have decided that George W. Bush is irrelevant
and must be replaced as leader of the United States. Every week, an
American somewhere murders, rapes, or brutalizes a foreigner. I hold the
president personally responsible for every such attack.

With American citizens continuing to kill and attack people in other
nations, Bush is clearly irrelevant to the world’s search for peace. I am
ceasing all contacts with him, immediately. And I am calling upon the
people of the United States to elect new and more effective leadership,
right away.

My critics will say that the president can not keep track of every U.S.
citizen everywhere in the world, and when Americans attack foreigners, he
denounces the attacks. But what is Bush doing to stop the violence? I want
to see deeds, not words. He is the leader of the country. He is
responsible for all its policies, all its actions, by all its people,
everywhere. He is sworn to uphold the Constitution, which calls for law
and order to prevail. If he can not fulfill his duties, then he is
irrelevant.

Bush has also made himself irrelevant by denying basic democratic and
constitutional rights to his own people. He came to power in an election
that appeared to be free and fair. But even his own Justice Department now
admits that many voters in Florida were illegally disenfranchised. Since
last September 11, he has suspended numerous civil liberties that used to
be considered basic to a democracy, using his parliament as a rubber stamp
to give his measures an appearance of legitimacy.

If Bush expects me to consider resuming contacts with him, he must first
show himself capable of running a genuinely democratic government. If he
can not (which seems likely, given his long history of ignoring individual
rights), then it is time for him to go.

This column is the opening shot in my major public relations campaign. I
plan to get the news media to repeat, over and over again, that Bush is
responsible for every act of violence by an American overseas, that he is
now irrelevant, and that the U.S. must choose a new leader. If the media
say it enough, people will begin to believe it. Eventually they will take
it for granted. Then it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. If enough
people assume that a leader is irrelevant, that leader does in fact become
irrelevant.

I learned this lesson from the government of Israel. Last fall, the New
York Times reported that Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon and his
advisors had decided to undermine Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat’s
authority. Their plan was to blame Arafat for every act of violence
committed by any Palestinian against any Jew and to declare Arafat an
ineffective leader, thus irrelevant to the peace process.

The plan has succeeded admirably, with plenty of help from the U.S.
government and news media. Arafat’s supposed “irrelevance” is now widely
accepted in the U.S. as a fact, even though he remains the only
Palestinian leader capable of making peace with the Israelis. So let’s
take a page from Israel’s playbook. Let’s blame Bush for everything that
goes wrong, anywhere, and demand that he leave office.

All joking aside, no leader can control the actions of all people in his
nation. It is always counterproductive to treat a nation’s leader as
irrelevant. And no nation has the right to tell another nation whom it can
or cannot choose as its leader.

But there is something to be said for treating a leader’s policies as
irrelevant, when they are counterproductive to humane goals and values.
Many courageous Palestinians have long treated Arafat’s security forces
and censorship as irrelevant, as they have gone about the daily business
of preparing for a truly democratic Palestinian state.

Here in the U.S., we should treat outrageous Bush administration policies
as irrelevant and continue our efforts to build a democratic, just, and
humane society. The Bush administration's Middle East policy is certainly
outrageous. it is based on the presumed U.S. right to tell the
Palestinians that they may no longer have the leader they choose, if Bush
and Sharon don’t like that leader. It is not Arafat, but the Bush Middle
East policy, that should be treated as irrelevant.

Weekly Update

June 26, 2002


DIRECTOR'S REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS:
I. CONTINUING THOUGHTS ON MAKING THE CASE
II. BUDGET UPDATE - no news yet
III. BITS & PIECES - passages


Hi everyone. If my remarks last week weren't of
interest to you, skip the first section. It's a little
long, but the subject is so complex.
I. MAKING THE CASE FOR THE ARTS

"So listen very carefully, and I know that you will
see what I mean..."
Apparently I touched on an issue in which many people
are interested in last week's Update. Here are some
additional thoughts.

First, I meant no slight in any way to all of those
selfless and dedicated people who have worked so hard
to mount advocacy efforts on behalf of the arts in
California. Those people are heroes. I can't thank
them enough. My comments weren't meant to diminish in
any way the enormous contribution so many of you have
made to protecting the arts; rather I meant to point
out that the model we have used for so long doesn't
work anymore. If it did, we wouldn't still be
defending the value of the arts to avoid wholesale
cuts. We can't continue ad infinitum to defend the
positive impact of creativity; we can't afford the
time and resources this ongoing effort takes. We have
to finally establish that value within the public
psyche as sacrosanct. This is what Steve Fogel said
when he assumed the Chair of the Arts Council three
years ago. It's that perspective that made me accept
this position. Yet, here we are - still devoting a
disproportionate amount of our too scarce time making
the case, ready to claim victory for a major step
backward - only because it could have been worse.

We have to rethink how to get the message across. What
we want is for there to be general acceptance of what
we know - that creativity - the arts - are essential
for California's future. Not a just a priority - but
the highest priority. The answer to the question Cui
Bono? (Latin for "Who gains?") must be ………Everyone.
How do we do that? Without any true resources behind
them, our efforts have been scattered; they have
worked some, but not enough. Now what?

In the last two years we have made enormous gains in
expanding the arts, due primarily to the Governor's
and Legislature's augmentation of our budget. No
Governor and Legislature has ever been more supportive
of the arts. This is a very hard time. Cuts have to be
made in appropriations. Nobody wants to make those
cuts. Every constituent group believes their area
shouldn't be cut. The Governor and Legislature are
doing the best they can for the whole of the state.
Not an easy task - and easy for everyone to be
critical. There is disagreement over how to bridge the
deficit gap. The backward step isn't their fault - it
isn't anybody's fault per se. We haven't gotten our
full message across - it isn't embedded in the
collective psyche. Four decades ago the clean air
movement might have had to endure Draconian cuts. But
we've all learned that clear air is something that
must be the highest priority. I believe we have to
begin to organize a systemic approach to succeed at
getting creativity to the same point. This isn't just
California's quandary - virtually every state in the
country is facing a similar set of circumstances.

It's harder to make our case than it was for clean
air. Proving the benefits of creativity is a more
elusive enterprise; more difficult to validate with
black or white tests and evidence - more subjective.

We have an opportunity to make this sea change in our
approach. The Public Opinion Survey showed that the
public is supportive and can be moved to action. This
is may be an ideal time to finally move forward with
establishing the value of the arts. I believe the
decision makers at every level are ready to be
receptive to the proposition that the arts are
essential. But we have to make a better case. The time
to make progress couldn't be better really. All the
work of the last 10 years has been to set up the
opportunity now in front of us to get to the next
level.

We've had three core arguments for the value of the
arts: 1) that the arts are an economic engine
producing jobs, tax revenue and economic activity; 2)
that the arts add significantly to the education and
the job preparation of our kids; and 3) that the arts
are good for civic life. We may now have a fourth
argument - Professor Richard Florida's thesis of the
importance of nurturing an environment attractive to
the emerging creative class. If his thesis is true,
then investing in the arts and creativity is a much
wiser public policy in terms of economic development
and competitive advantage than supporting sports
stadiums with public money; smarter than using
taxpayer money to subsidize industrial parks; sounder
than continuing to supporting existing industries and
special interests.

The arguments in favor of investing in the arts and
creativity are sound and persuasive. But they haven't
yet overcome the legacy of the arts being considered
an elective. When former National Endowment for the
Arts (NEA) Director Bill Ivey said that the NEA is the
province of the East Wing and the First Lady, the
implication was that the arts are marginalized and
undervalued in part because they are perceived as
women's work and therefore less important. I believe
that primitive bias still exists - often unbeknownst
to, and certainly denied by, those that hold it. I
think too that the arts are marginalized because for
so long they were also seen as volunteer work, and
therefore not that important. There is, no doubt, a
whole subset of reasons why people think of the arts
as nonessential.

Despite the evidence, the arts are not yet seen as an
economic tool. If that deeply embedded misperception
doesn't change, the arts will never get the support
they merit. Dr. Florida says there are 38 million
people now in the Creative Class. Those 38 million
people - where they live, what they do, the choices
they make - will determine the economic future of
every state, city and area of this country in the next
two decades, and probably long beyond. The high-tech
industry and the dot.com phenomenon were created by
those people. It is wholly irrelevant that the
dot.coms crashed, or that the high-tech industry has
changed. Twenty years ago it didn't even exist. Those
that created the revolution are equally important as
the industry itself, yet we continue to make the
mistake of exclusively embracing the thing instead of
including the creators of the thing. Building super
industry parks in Silicon Valley virtually assures
that the creative class will NOT thrive down there,
but will seek other pastures. Steve Jobs, Steve
Wozniak and the others who created the computer
revolution wouldn't be attracted to the area today.
The dot.com revolution success almost nullified San
Francisco's attraction to the creative class in that
it accelerated yuppification and threatened to price
the younger end of the creative class out of the
marketplace. What is crucial is to address the needs
and preferences of the creative class, for wherever
they end up, that is the place that will benefit from
whatever new revolution is created - for they are the
ones that will create it.

Florida's thesis is that this class is attracted to
places where there is diversity and tolerance - a
mixture of quasi-bohemia, culture and openness to
creativity. The arts, particularly the cutting edge,
newer arts experimentation, avant-garde people help to
create the environment that the creative class seeks
and demands. Their number one self-identified need is
challenge in their work - not money, not stock
options. They want an environment where creativity is
pervasive, valued and is growing; where new ideas are
the dominant currency. They want the energy and
excitement that exists when creativity flourishes.
That's the climate that nurtures the new economic
growth, the new entrepreneurs - the people who will
create the new Silicon Valleys of California. Those
that don't see this run the risk of losing those
people to wherever the powers that be do see it,
understand it, embrace it. Austin, Texas is the model.


I think in the very near future creativity will be
recognized as the economic force for the future. News
magazines will feature it on their covers; TV pundits
will analyze it ad nauseam; advertisers will use it to
sell products; universities will offer courses on it;
corporations will hire specialists to manage it - and
despite all that, it will still find its way and
emerge as an important economic development factor
that will no longer be ignored. Where will California
be when that happens? Because we have so long been
seen as the place where ideas become reality, where
dreams take shape, because several of our cities have
the elements that make them attractive to the creative
class (at least for now), and because creativity has
always been alive here - we will thrive. But at what
level, and when? Will we lead the charge, or be an
also ran? Only time will tell if this theory is valid,
or merely the flavor of the month.

Creativity can't be manufactured, but the environment
that facilitates it can be nurtured. If Florida is
right, and we do nothing, many of our cities will be
left behind because they won't have taken steps to be
competitive, and that portends an inequity of have and
have-nots. California is the most diverse place on the
planet - as I've said before, every culture exists
here. How do we take advantage of this opportunity?
While we may benefit from the coattails of our legacy,
we may also play catch-up to other centers that figure
out how to invest and nurture the twin assets of
creativity and diversity before we make a similar
commitment. (And, we currently don't even consider
creativity and diversity as economic assets/tools, let
alone have a strategic approach to their protection
and development). We may not enjoy the dominant
position that is there right now for us to develop,
and as a consequence we may lose market share of new
industries, and with it jobs and prosperity. Once we
lose even a small part of our advantage, recovery is
much harder. Investment now is cheaper and smarter.
Moreover, even a small percentage loss of the
development of new ideas may translate into huge
dollar amounts. Like a living plant, we need to water
it. And we aren't. One way to protect the potential of
what we have is the minuscule investment it would take
to advance the arts and thus the environment of
creativity. Certainly we ought to do whatever it takes
to insure that those new industries and commerce we
can't even fathom today, develop here, and that we are
at the front of reaping the benefits that come when
the winds blow in new directions. Our argument has
been that while the arts are only a part of the
equation, they are a critically important part. A $100
million investment in the arts amounts to what former
CAC Director Barbara Pieper used to refer to as
"budget dust," yet that tiny annual investment (1/10th
of 1% of the budget) would reap rewards for California
for generations to come. The economic crisis should
herald an increase in the investment, not cuts. But we
haven't yet been able to convince key decision makers
of this. And that's what we have to do.

Much is at stake, and we are making slow progress in
getting the message across. But we still don't have
all our ducks in a row. We don't have ongoing
relationships with the media and newspaper editorial
boards (and media coverage still isn't what it ought
to be); we don't have a systemic mechanism to meet
with and keep informed boards of education, city
councils, boards of supervisors, mayors, or other
elected officials; we don't have any institutionalized
connection to the academic community; we don't have
any management of strategic alliances with
stakeholders - from the PTA and AARP to the League of
California Cities, unions, and professional
associations; we don't have a centralized speakers'
bureau; we don't have a strategic approach to
research; we don't have celebrity or other outside the
arts spokespeople available to testify; we aren't even
at all the tables where we need to be; and we still
don't have any real strategy to involve business as a
partner. And most importantly we don't have any plan
to motivate the public that supports the arts to act
to protect and grow creativity. And even if we did, we
have no one to quarterback the effort.

We need to provide to everybody the full complement of
current tools and evidentiary materials to make the
case. For example, what we ought to do is create a
step-by-step, easy to use tool-kit for conducting a
reliable local economic impact study and make that
available to everyone, thus empowering research at the
local level. Ditto a Public Opinion Survey. Those are
just two things we might do. Ultimately, of course,
there ought to be a major arts PAC; artists and those
with arts administration backgrounds should run for
public office - from local school boards to the state
legislature; alliances should be formed with Hollywood
and Silicon Valley based on mutual self-interest; the
arts should become major players in the tourism
industry; and the arts should seize every opportunity
to involve their audiences - opportunities currently
being squandered.

I know that the economic argument is not the only
reason to champion the creative spirit. The
environment that creativity demands and supports is
the same environment that promotes tolerance and
builds bridges between people; it is the same
environment that promotes education and, more
importantly, genuine learning, the same environment
that respects divergent ideas, that values team work,
that celebrates risk-taking, that insists on fun and
play and joy. And I think that we should always make
the argument that creativity helps the heart
accumulate wealth.

So how do we overcome the entrenched misperceptions
and build consensus that the arts are fundamentally
critical to our future - as much as clean air, public
safety, and education? Is a concerted, centralized,
coordinated effort, supported by all segments of the
arts community, with backing by those who support
arts, culture and creativity, working to organize and
facilitate the efforts of the arts community worth
considering? Is it even possible? How would it work?
How would it be funded? What would it do? Who would
lead it? Is every segment interested and willing to
participate in the effort? There are scores of
questions - if there is enough interest we need to
begin to seek answers.

This has to have buy-in from, and be accessible by,
every corner of the community, because this kind of
effort would be doomed from the get-go if only some of
the sectors were enthusiastic. I hope people will
discuss the issue - it's critically important to every
organization's future. How do we make the case for the
value of creativity - and the arts - to California
once and for all? How do we do that together?

If I can find the time, I plan to write a monograph or
White Paper on the topic that Americans for the Arts
CEO Bob Lynch said he would publish for me. I plan to
talk to Foundations about it, and discuss it with my
colleagues on the national level and anyone else who
will listen.

I welcome your thoughts.

So sat around all night here in Albany with Don Byrd & Ken Irby & talked up
Philip Whalen & many stories were told & poems read & it seems to me the
poem that made everyone happy & sigh ah! this is Whalen indeed is:

F U R T H E R   N O T I C E

I can't live in this world
And I refuse to kill myself
Or let you kill me

The dill plant lives, the airplane
My alarm clock, this ink
I won't go away

I shall be myself --
Free, a genius, an embarrassment
Like the Indian, the buffalo

Like Yellowstone National Park.

I think there's some truth to what Andrew says here.  As a counter-example
close to me personally, I'd cite Paul Killebrew's review of my _Morning
Constitutional_ in SLOPE 14:
http://ledoptix.com/slope2/index.phtml?url=this&section=killebrew2
The review is quite critical at times (one poem he described as "camp
safety in the dominant paradigm's own end zone"!) but it's smart and
serious and I appreciate it as such, even when I disagree with it's
judgements and premises.  Hell, as long as someone's reading carefully I'm
thankful!    -m.

He is correct; as an elliptical poet, Bromige has come full circle.

Jorie Graham talks (it seems to me) intelligently
about these poets (I categorically exclude myself, not
because I perhaps don't share stylistic or thematic
affinities but because I am an upstart and generally
contrary) in the on-line interview with Mark
Wunderlich at www.poets.org.

She says something like "there's no end-run around the
vale of soul-making"

which is sort like Old Jesse McVey, who Utah Phillips
quotes as muttering "It don't matter how New Age you
get, Old Age gone kick yo ass!"

The discussion between Nick, Murat and others is one of the most
interesting on the list.  Last year, I published a paper on "Aspects of
Poetics," based on a talk I gave to the Chicago Poetry Seminar.  Part
of  it (all of it eventually) is now posted on on
http://www.culturalsociety.org/aspects.html

Here is a short extract from the end of the first section:

'While there is thought, nothing is inevitable. If a new poetics signals
closures, and thereby new openings, we might meditate on Ernest Bloch's
words in The Spirit of Utopia. There Bloch maintains that "the sign of an
authentic end opens into emptiness." If we posit a poetics as an "authentic
end," that is, if we desire that it be significant and create the
opportunity to remake human time, we are required, according to Bloch, to
address it toward emptiness, without overlaying it with preconceptions.
Against our usual psychologizing, we would have to think of a new poetics
without the kind of Golden Ageism that we normally apply both forward and
backward to our historical thinking. In this regard, Rose's notion of the
future as anachronism is helpful. For if the future which we carry in our
minds is bound already to be an anachronism, beyond our power to control,
then it stands to reason that only by freeing ourselves from a heavy-handed
premising of that future can we be led into what Bloch calls "the unfated,
or at least into a fate that can be modified."
"The unfated" is in itself a remarkable idea, worthy of further
contemplation from both the literary and philosophical-historical
perspective. As a potential for poetics, the idea is already prefigured in
Keats' poet of "negative capability" or, closer to Bloch's time, in Robert
Musil's comments in Precision and Soul on the poet Rilke."Rilke," he says,
"leads us into the future;" he gives us, "not prophecy," but an
"anticipatory scent." For we are not, Musil insists, "to be called again to
this or that ideological fixity, but to the unfolding of the creation and
possibilities of the spirit."'

My piece was about poetics as a manifesto, internalized or external.  In
this sense, it might be at odds with Nick's more generous, idealistic (even
utopian) sense of the genre.

   This was fascinating and sort of depressing; thanks for passing it along.

   The CAC director's message that the Gov and Legis must be persuaded to
see the arts as "an economic engine" distresses the hell out of me.  For one
thing, I think it's phony; I think it's pandering to the Reaganite
mentality; it is analogous to the road "socialist realism" went down under
the totalitarian regimes that passed (and in China's case, still do)
themselves off as Marxist.  Art is an economic engine for other people than
artists (if for anyone at all), and in poetry's case, for almost nobody.
People who publish poetry generally do so at a loss; people who write poetry
make almost no money directly from their work (I usually describe my income
from poetry as hitting 'the high two figures' annually).... la di da.   Must
we try to fit ourselves into these stupid commercial conceptual girdles?  Is
this a Br'er Rabbit deal where we lie to them to get what we want?

Savoring the recent posts by Nick and others, I have been sidelining and absorbing, a curious counterpart to the fast ride across obligations of these days.

Poetics is indeed a field of opportunity for many poets. As with many experiences, the most satisfying and enriching possibilities seem to exist where there lives a foundation of trust. The erosion of that trust, or the juxtaposition of name-making as a primary preoccupation, diminishes the quality of exchange. As Nick has rightly pointed out, this list, throughout its different incarnations, offers a rich context for sharing and exploration.

Some critics' criticism may indeed function as a relatively safer, wannabe zone, in comparison with the poem-making zone. (Playing fields are often crooked, slanted, or in some way tipped.) Whatever the case, there appears to be an inherent disinclination to enter the playing field (of poetics) by people who may feel a resistance to the possibility of what might easily become a hostile environment.

As with any game scenario, one makes the decision of
1)whether to enter,
2)what elements to consider once there, and
3) how ethically to behave once in the game.

I propose that there may be too much game these or any days for the likes of art.

In the field of music, a disappointing moment, not precisely parallel to what I have touched upon above, came as a sterilized view of performance to which I was introduced at an all-too-formative time. I recall a particular professor who basically perceived the study of music in this vein: "Let's see . . . as a sophomore you should now be playing this part of the literature." This was in stark contrast to the consuming love for the art that I had felt from my first, very accomplished flute teacher, who never allowed the specialness of the piece, its performance, or the learning from it, to be made small. The contrast proved a learning experience, and I continue to feel fortunate to have had the person with greater respect (and, ultimately, capacity) be my initiation into the process!

Poetry and poetics are enherently joined, and to great advantage IFF (if and only if) with the right spirit. Being a genuinely engaged player is a first step. In the final analysis, there seems to be a person, giving it his/her all, engaging with others, rehearsing the possibility of caring or not caring, and "going for" whatever comes. If the poetry is let go, or just scratched to no effect, in the process, and if the poet becomes disincented to write and grow, then what?

People are more delicate than we are given credit for. In that delicacy of human interaction lie a multitude of possibilities for growth, beauty, extension, art, and even love. I find some of the raw stuff less than helpful, and I find some spheres of engagement less than heuristic. Ultimately, I suspect that each of us chooses what will be the most rewarding and growth-enhancing.

this is a beautiful post.  i agree w/ nick and others that
criticism/critique/poetics is not about king-making.  the most useful role
poetics can play is to explore ideas/feelings/words/critique through
articulating ideas/feelings/words/critique --not through a process that
revolves around elevating some names-cum-poems and diminishing others.

Philip Whalen -- co-founder of Beat poetry

Heidi Benson, Chronicle Staff Writer
Thursday, June 27, 2002
C2002 San Francisco Chronicle.

Philip Whalen, a seminal member of the Beat poets who began a San
Francisco poetry renaissance in the 1950s, died Wednesday morning in San
Francisco after a long illness.

Mr. Whalen, who was ordained as a Zen Buddhist priest in 1973 and served
as abbot of the Hartford Street Zen Center in San Francisco, was 78.

"He was a poet's poet," said Gary Snyder, on hearing of his friend's
death. "His intelligence and skill is very subtle and very deep. There
are many poets who feel in his debt."

In 1955, Mr. Whalen joined Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Michael
McClure, Philip Lamantia and Snyder for the historic Six Gallery
reading. Organized by poet Kenneth Rexroth, who was later dubbed the
"godfather" of the Beats, the reading took place in a former auto repair
shop at Fillmore and Union for an audience of 150.

The poets -- most of whom hadn't met before that night -- became instant
celebrities. Whalen's poetry was soon published in the influential
Evergreen Review and appeared in the 1959 Grove Press anthology, "New
American Poetry."

Born in Portland, Ore., on Oct. 20, 1923, Mr. Whalen grew up in The
Dalles on the Columbia River. He attended Reed College on the GI bill
after serving in the Army Air Forces during World War II. Snyder was a
classmate, and recalled that Mr. Whalen was already immersed in Asian
philosophy and poetry at that time.

They exchanged letters for many years, Snyder said, "about politics,
philosophy, literature, poetics, Buddhist practice and Buddhist thought
-- all on a kind of fun level."

"He reminded me of Dr. Samuel Johnson. His humor was dry, witty, ironic
and learned," said Snyder. "It was always very instructive."

Mr. Whalen's many books include the 1967 poetry collection "On Bear's
Head";

"Canoeing up Cabarga Creek: Buddhist Poems 1955-1986"; "Enough Said:
1974- 1979"; "Heavy Breathing: Poems, 1967-1980"; "The Kindness of
Strangers"; "Severance Pay"; and "Two Novels."

In recent days, while discussing his death with friends whom he thought
were treating the subject too morbidly, Mr. Whalen said: "I'd like to be
laid on a bed of frozen raspberries."

He is survived by a sister, Velna Whalen, of San Diego. Plans for a
memorial service are pending.

Joe,

I agree, poetry is not very efficient, very good as a response to an
immediate, "overwhelming urgency" in the public domain. It is a "parallel,"
often delayed, rather than direct activity. That's its limitation and its

Writing a movie script for money (that's I hope what you are partly doing it
for, my son is doing the same thing) are you not dealing more with questions
of clarity, length, responding to formal conventions, etc.? Is that not the
presence or expectation of that public link, or its absence, which
differentiates other writing from poetry? Blur (too long, messy, etc) may be
a poetic virtue -of failure.

Of course, the distinctions are never absolute. Even the most public arts
experiment, creating a tension between public and subjective (experimental?).
Cinema Verite, for example (Goddard being the supreme example), may be one of
these historical moments the tension is in exquisite balance.

"Practice" limits the claims of the absolute. Even the most narcissistic
absolute internalizes the dream of a public, of "potential consideration by
other soulless bipeds."

Thanks for the comments.

First of all, I was saddened to hear of Philip Whalen's death. Perhaps I =

I want to thank everyone who sent me "assignments," and those who still =

have been some excellent suggestions, and I will attempt most of them.

It has dawned on me that since I have been so public about this project, =
perhaps I should
share the results. I'll try to do at least one assignment a week, =
although I've already done
one this morning. Obviously, I don't want to impose my poetry upon =
anyone, and if you're

imposition.

But it could be fun, since you'll also be reading any failures I produce =
as well as a possible
success. Perhaps you can laugh along with my awkward attempts to =
accomplish some=20
of the challenges many of you have put before me.

I thought I'd begin with Paul Vangelisti's request. This will appear in =
the new issue of

LAZY

Lazy? There was that day I wanted to stay in bed
after six! (Posterior possibilities of the past.)
The book fell to sleep in my lap! I wanted to send you a postcard
instead of a letter: Dear freedom, here's the design
I envision for you--Get up, eat eggs, egg on
the ones you love, love less than your desire
to devour, eat more meat.
                                     Indeed I always wanted to be
conscious in my sleep, which I stole from Alice (Notley).

Everyone stops for tea, and I not even for the dead.
The carriage comes and takes me away to an old
upright upon which I type: There is a terrible
yawning in the face of the future. The past
is always preferred by those who lived
through it. It's not fun to be on the verge

on the wall with his little legs dangling over
the edge and with a good case of vertigo too
I should imagine having rolled out his days
with that uncertain wobbling effect. But why didn't they
call a surgeon instead of all those horses and horsemen
trampling him to death? It's easier to let the government
come to the rescue I suspect. The cows are all asleep and can't give =
milk
                                                                         =
                                 until morning
or mourning what's been spilled is over and wiped up.

Toast and eggs, burnt bread and buns shining in the sun
that's why I stood and dressed. Not enterprise but modesty,
embarrassment. I've got a fat ass from doing everything I've done.
I amost didn't write this poem as a matter of fact
as I get fatter I find it more and more difficult
to accomplish any act that doesn't rest on what's behind.
The mother of my goose is merely the pact I made with the publisher
                                                                         =

I reply:

I don't want to seem a spoil sport here, but all poetics (however defined and
however explored) elevate some names (poems) and diminish others. There's
no getting away from that. Any way of looking at poetry will inevitably raise
the poems that lend themselves to being looked at the way that the
critic/reader is disposed to looking.

Which is, I suppose, why it's fundamentally necessary to keep looking, to
have many looking, so that the world of poets/poems doesn't get defined by
a few loud voices.

PS. I do believe, as well, that all poems are poetics, as well as critiques of
existing poems . . . that old "silencing an existing rhetoric" saw.

PPS. As well I believe that all manifestfeet contain manifestoes.

In the early 90's my wife and I took a trip to Cape Ann. We stopped in =
Gloucester, and found it very appealing in a small-city kind of way. =
Even though most of what Olson fought to preserve was long gone, I =
sensed what he'd been trying to keep. Seeing the church of Our Lady of =
Good Voyage was a very moving experience. I didn't get a sense that the =

town. I'm attaching a poem I wrote about the experience.

"Also, 'evaluation' of poetry is the most important part of the process and
is
unavoidable. Whenever a group of like minded individuals coalesesces into a
school or movement, an act which outwardly is political, a myriad of
'evaluative' judgements have gone into that coalescence.

Further, the implied moral dimension involved in the judgement of anything is
a
remnant of times before the "ruthless unaccountability" of the sciences and
their methods of quantification and mathematization came along. Other
disciplines like psychoanalysis have expended great energy trying to become
scientific. Poetry's take has been that the sciences have overwhelmed it and
deomonstrated that virtually all of its operating principles have little or
no
efficacy at all. The fact that poetics hasn't been able to counter this
speaks
volumes of the talent and energy of our current generation of poets. It also
demonstrates that not only will there be those who feel poets should not
evaluate the work of each other in order to have a little of that
quantitative
immunity rub off on them, but the highly politicized activity of
'evaluating'
other cutlural entities is also beyond the purview of poetry. A different
form
of 'evaluation'? At first glimpse yes, but upon reflection its all part of
the
evaluative process that would be denied by some."

murat, thanx... yes, i'd be a fool not to say outright that one of
the primary (thus far, regrettably fictional) appeals of
screenwriting is moolah (there are other appeals, as well---for
another time)... i won't get into the reasons why moolah is so
important to me---suffice to say, my current wage doesn't suffice...
at least, not based on my sense of entitlement, which (i would say)
is a far cry less keen than most of my colleagues, but a far cry more
keen than most of humanity (lucky unmonkish me)...

now, one of the more curious aspects to have emerged from this
scripting process has been that i've found that domain's focus on
moolah downright refreshing... yknow, beats the shit out of hearing
from some senior editor of a major trade that "i like your work, but
i don't LOVE it enough to publish it" (this is almost verbatim, and
if i must:  i've gone the trade route at times b/c the small presses
have been uninterested in my longer prose work)...

well yknow, always nice to cut through the bullshit... better to hear
someone say "you're work won't make me moolah" than to hear someone
fudge money and symbolic/cultural capital and aesthetics and love
altogether... better to have a strong enemy than a weak friend, if
you know what i mean...

i like "practice" in the sense, for one, that the sociologists like
it---"science is what scientists do"... now of course, scientists
have imaginations too---that is, imagining is part of what they do
(all naysaying to the contrary)---but this approach is a nice
corrective in any case to more euclidean understandings of scientific
practice, whereby the science of 300 years ago becomes "bad science"
(or unscientific) merely b/c it doesn't measure up to so & so's
conception of science today... in poetry, to say that "poetry is what
poets do" is in some sense an antidote to blanket conceptions of
unpoetry, and bad poetry... but more importantly, to think in terms
of practice, *for poets*, can be helpful in mitigating that
understanding of language activity which is so far beyond the ken of
mortal intellect that one may search in vain for the appropriate, uh,
inspiration...

the inspiration is all around us, christ...

i'm extremely interested in the discussion of poetix, precisely where
it intersects with the notion that poetry is a language practice...
things begin to slip and slide in productive ways, i think, once
poetix tries to account for its own evaluative apparatus (let's
say)... i agree with andrew r and others who are making the claim
that judgment is necessary, indeed unavoidable... my only reservation
turns on how said judgment is carried out---i.e., i lean toward those
modes of inquiry that (again) call attention to their grounding
(yeah, here on the third planet from the sun)...

best,

Making Scenes: Adrienne Eisen's debut novel, "Making Scenes," brings back to life the rival tradition of American writing from Henry Miller to Kathy Acker.

.echo: With Alan Sondheim's novel of mystical eroticism, ".echo" readers will lose themselves in a net fiction charged with sex, obsession and codework.

The three new books join the three recently published books of Alt-X
Press POD:  Mark Amerika's collection, "How To Be an Internet Artist";
the novel "Cows" by Ronald Sukenick, this year's winner of the American

"Further, the 'evaluative' act if we can describe it as such, demonstrates
serious  commitment and engagement with the genre and the object under
evaluation. This is because the evaluator is in turn asking that his
considerations be evaluated. He or she often does this at some risk though
always
modest because we are after all talking about poetry. Still there's always a
bit
of courage attached to this approach though one hastens not to exaggerate the
amount of courage involved.

Further, evaluation takes place all the time but for a variety of reasons
rarely
involves the poetry itself. Take some of the baseless evaluations regarding
Finnegans Wake that appeared on the Buffalo list as of late. This reader of
the
Wake can't imagine the body of scholars of Joyce and the Wake taking that
gaggle
of poets seriously after they proffered inanities and personal inadequacies
as
valid evaluation of the Wake.

And there is the 'subjectivity' of these evaluations as regards poetry. The
sciences, by binding the notions of progress to a geographically limited and
therefore potentially threatened standard of material well-being requiring an
empire for maintenance, have proselytized the idea that they deal with the
'object' itself and therefore the properties they regard as 'being' the
'object'
are equally inviolable. Of course, ten years studying the history and
epistemology of science disabuses the student (& poet) of the efficacy of
holding
such a position not to mention the immorality.

Poetry too has its 'objects' and like the sciences these objects should be
open
to conjecture even as they retain a certain Platonic inviolability validated
daily
by human activity. But still poetry, social sciences and the arts in general
want
to cadge off of this chimera of the immutability of the scientific object by
confusing the evaluative, that is mutable elements of science (within strict
confines of institutional practice and the limits of the investigating
organism,
etc.) with its own inner conflict that is its need to associate itself with
the
immutable. Once poets determine that their poetry should not be subject to
evaluation, it is a very short arc to where that poetry has no value at all.
We
have certainly arced over."

"Walt Whiteman is undeniably the most powerful poet of America, and the most
American of poets. He was thirty-six when his -Leaves of Grass- appeared in
1855. Neither Homes nor Lowell not Whittier was clear-sighted enough to
perceive any genius or talent in those fervent poems. Indeed, the whole of
contemporary American criticism (if the transcendentalists Emerson, Thoreau,
and Alcott are excepted) displayed a blind and ferocious hostility. Henry E.
Legler, the author of a small volume entitled -Walt Whitman, Yesterday and
To-day- Chicago,1916, has collected some of the anathemas which then rained
upon the poet. Not all of them bear quotation. Among the choice phrases
coined or used by critics where: "slopbucket," "noxious weeds," "entirely
bestial," "impious and obscene," "a belief in the preciousness of filth,"
"defilement," "broken out of Bedlam," "ithyphallic audacity," "sunken
sensualist," "rotten garbage of licentious thoughts," "a poet whose
indecencies stink in the nostrils," "venomously malignant," "degraded helot
of literature,""the mouthings of a mountebank." Among the American
periodicals, the -Criterion-, -Putnam's Magazine-, and the -Christian
Examiner- were the least restrained in their vituperation. The latter,
published in Boston, uttered a moral warning: "The book...openly deifies the
bodily organs, senses, and appetites in terms that admit of no double sense"
(November 1856)....Even more characteristic of the critics' obtuseness were
their purely literary comments in which they tried to judge -Leaves of
Grass- on other grounds than those of self-righteous and indignant morality.
The -Crayon-, of New York, uttered its verdict in these terms: "The book has
no identity, no concentration, no purpose; it is barbarous, undisciplined,
like the poetry of a half-civilized people...The -London Lancet- of July 7,
1860, is typical of the British welcome given to the poet of democracy: "Of
all the writers we have perused, Walt Whitman is the most silly, the most
blasphemous, and the most disgusting." No less an authority than a future
poet laureate of Great Britain, Alfred Austin, declared that such
"grotesque, ungrammatical, repulsive rhapsodies can be compared only to the
painful ravings of maniacs' dens." As late as 1876, the -Saturday Review- of
London, hearing that the friends of Whitman had appealed to the public for
financial help, as the American poet was sick and in distress, published a
cruel retort: "The assumptions that a man who sets himself to outrage public
decency should be gratefully supported by public charity is certainly a very
curious one." And it explained with plausible sophistry that it was a
healthy sign that the public had not bought these unsalable poems, and a
mark of God's providence that a poet like Whitman fail to make a living by
his writing....After twenty or thirty years of neglect, during which
Longfellow's "Psalm of Life" was bought and recited by millions, the
slighted poems of Whitman came into their own. Swinburne and Baudelaire and
Zola had in the meanwhile prepared the readers of America to hail the
originality of their own revolutionary bard."

and I think this intriguingly relects Antin's comments and also items in
_Homo Sonorus_ (Regrettably this does not appear readily available in the
U.S.) which contains practitioners' thoughts on their relation to
contemporary music and the relationships of sound and preformance work to
the invention of sound recording equipment and motion pictures (e.g., Rea
Nikonova "Sound poetry is the only poetry with a technical base").  It also
contains Rothenberg on performance poetics.and this from Dmitri Prigov, "the
risk of of participants of different projects differs.  If the risk of the
traditional artist is the risk of happening to be a not very talented and
lucky producer of certain conventional verbal or visual texts, then the risk
of the radical artist is a risk of being totaally unrecognized by culture as
an artist."

As one who has partaken of the other culture I feel contrary to popular
belief, the poetics of scientific discurse isn't overburdened with equations
and rats and such but tends to have a lot of talk of tenure and who's got
what grant, etc., and if I should talk with a colleague (or supervisee)
about a case, the comments are likely to be aesthetic, as in "you handled
that beautifully"

Interesting article and this discussion seems to be going in several
directions but they are all intriguing so I'll follow up here on one thing
you raise:

you note that Devin Johston "asked about the 'slippage of the term 'poetics'
between a statement or reflection on the generating principles of one's
poetry' and 'something like ideology'" and I think that slippage is what is
of interst to me here in this discussion in that my interest is in the
generating of poetry rather than the philosophy of poetry


However your comments ion the avant-garde and the future as anachronism lead
me to insert a lengthy bit that came up in Sunday's NYTimes on among other
things, the differences in the way men and women experience pain and then
I'm also adding Dr. Basmanan's response to my quetry [posted as query
without closure rather than as answer as I think this is all connected but
don't know how yet]
"It[pain]'s generated by transmission of an injury message but also by what
that message means, how it's interpreted. Once the message gets to the
brain, it may or may not lead to pain perception. If you imagine looking at
a Mondrian, there are a few bars and stripes, yellow, black, a little red.
But it can bring tears to some peoples' eyes, for others it does nothing.
Same stimulus, different experience. That's how pain is processed."

Dear Dr. Bell,


Thank you for your note.


I wish that there were  more, but there isn't. This is an analogy that I
have discussed with students to whom I teach about pain.  It usually comes
up in the context of trying to figure out "where in the cortex is pain".
The vision physiologists/psychologists seem perfectly happy to conclude that
visual perception is in the occipital lobe, or perhaps in some of the
parietal/visual areas.  The pain world is much more confused as to the
localization; it could be arguee (and I agree) that there is no single area
that encodes pain perceptions.  My argument is that the visual folks are not
examining a perception at all comparable to pain. The more correct question
perhaps is "where is beauty?".  Beauty involves a perception of a stimulus,
with an affective/emotional component to the perception; the perception is
influenced by experience, culture, age, etc. That is the origin of the
Mondrian analogy. Lots of stripes and colors, precisely what neurons in the
visual cortex respond to, but not, I believe where they perception lies.
That is precisely what the perception of pain is all about; it is an
appreciation of a physical stimulus (usually) but the perception is colored
with emotions and influenced very much by experience. No emotions, no pain.


Although the precise analogy to art appreciation has never been made (to my
knowledge) certainly many others have recognized the importance of affect
and cognition to the pain experience.

question:
what does the death of the author, which has been a critical commonplace
since 1968, mean to poets, poetry and poetics?

I wish it were that simple. I would suggest that the death of the author
results in autopsy.

And once the critic and author are both dead?  It means the death of the
typewriter salesman.  And once he is dead?  It means the fedora shop has to
close its doors. And once that happens, watch the economy fall like a field
of dominoes-- until all is left is the farmer, standing among corn.

I believe that we have had the death of the reader since 1968. This the
death year of the Avant Garde as well. It would seem that there is no
real recognition for the writing of poetry outside of people in poetry.
So one skill takes over another.

It would appear that this is the call for anarchism. Either within the
self bridging on the establishment seeking a freedom that will propell
that person upon a level playing field. Read Mikhail Bakunin. Here is an
interesting link.

oops, that link wasn't so good -- here we go.


Bakunin, Mikhail Alexandrovich (1814 - 1876)
Russian revolutionist, the moving spirit of nineteenth-century anarchism.


Although remembered mostly for his revolutionary passion, he was learned,
intelligent, and philosophically reflective. In moments of intermittent
recess from insurrection and imprisonment he wrote influential
formulations of anarchist philosophy and incisive and insightful
criticisms of Marxism. He maintained that political power was
intrinsically oppressive whether wielded by the bourgeoisie or the
proletariat. Real freedom was possible only after the destruction of the
status quo. But the individual's freedom was so bound up with that of
society that nothing short of 'collectivism', a non-governmental system
based on voluntary co-operation without private property and with reward
according to contribution, was required. In philosophical outlook he was
a voluntaristic determinist, respectful of the authority of science but
sharply critical of the authority of scientists. A keen materialist, he
was ferociously anti-theological.

Everybody involved in the process seems to be dead: author, critic and
reader. Has anybody considered who killed who when and what the consequences
are? Are these people, their poetry and poetics, more dead than the novel or
jazz? Does the literary output of ghosts assert or deny the materiality of
language? And if I'm dead, why do I feel the urge to eat lunch?

<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Apology for Criticism
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt; (This responds to Nick Piombino's recent post, in which he asks that
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt; "poetics" not make evaluative claims about particular works.)
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt; "Poetics" is the attempt to reconstruct the principles of good writing
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt; based on known examples. It is thus subsequent to judgment. Aristotle did
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt; not have to persuade anyone that Oedipus was a good play. He just wanted
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt; to figure out how Sophocles had done it, so that others might do it too.
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt; Evaluative criticism is the highest kind of writing about poetry.
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;"Walt Whiteman is undeniably the most powerful poet of America, and the most
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;American of poets. He was thirty-six when his -Leaves of Grass- appeared in
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;1855. Neither Homes nor Lowell not Whittier was clear-sighted enough to
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;perceive any genius or talent in those fervent poems. Indeed, the whole of
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;contemporary American criticism (if the transcendentalists Emerson, Thoreau,
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;and Alcott are excepted) displayed a blind and ferocious hostility. Henry E.
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;Legler, the author of a small volume entitled -Walt Whitman, Yesterday and
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;To-day- Chicago,1916, has collected some of the anathemas which then rained
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;upon the poet. Not all of them bear quotation. Among the choice phrases
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;coined or used by critics where: "slopbucket," "noxious weeds," "entirely
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;bestial," "impious and obscene," "a belief in the preciousness of filth,"
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;"defilement," "broken out of Bedlam," "ithyphallic audacity," "sunken
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;sensualist," "rotten garbage of licentious thoughts," "a poet whose
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;indecencies stink in the nostrils," "venomously malignant," "degraded helot
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;of literature,""the mouthings of a mountebank." Among the American
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;periodicals, the -Criterion-, -Putnam's Magazine-, and the -Christian
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;Examiner- were the least restrained in their vituperation. The latter,
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;published in Boston, uttered a moral warning: "The book...openly deifies the
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;bodily organs, senses, and appetites in terms that admit of no double sense"
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;(November 1856)....Even more characteristic of the critics' obtuseness were
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;their purely literary comments in which they tried to judge -Leaves of
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;Grass- on other grounds than those of self-righteous and indignant morality.
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;The -Crayon-, of New York, uttered its verdict in these terms: "The book has
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;no identity, no concentration, no purpose; it is barbarous, undisciplined,
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;like the poetry of a half-civilized people...The -London Lancet- of July 7,
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;1860, is typical of the British welcome given to the poet of democracy: "Of
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;all the writers we have perused, Walt Whitman is the most silly, the most
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;blasphemous, and the most disgusting." No less an authority than a future
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;poet laureate of Great Britain, Alfred Austin, declared that such
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;"grotesque, ungrammatical, repulsive rhapsodies can be compared only to the
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;painful ravings of maniacs' dens." As late as 1876, the -Saturday Review- of
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;London, hearing that the friends of Whitman had appealed to the public for
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;financial help, as the American poet was sick and in distress, published a
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;cruel retort: "The assumptions that a man who sets himself to outrage public
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;decency should be gratefully supported by public charity is certainly a very
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;curious one." And it explained with plausible sophistry that it was a
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;healthy sign that the public had not bought these unsalable poems, and a
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;mark of God's providence that a poet like Whitman fail to make a living by
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;his writing....After twenty or thirty years of neglect, during which
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;Longfellow's "Psalm of Life" was bought and recited by millions, the
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;slighted poems of Whitman came into their own. Swinburne and Baudelaire and
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;Zola had in the meanwhile prepared the readers of America to hail the
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;originality of their own revolutionary bard."

Dont forget to mention that the electronic poetry list is also dead, the book
has been gone for a long time, public fascination for poetry has alzheimer's,
bookstores might as well be selling widgets & living breathing poetry in the
classroom is kept alive by a remote few.  Now if we swivel to think about the
Text, the infra-structure is alive & well, mended to its digital nuts & bolts,
content or not.  The Text is common & disjunct, pervasive & perverse, known &
uncalculated, hidden within spam & buried in terrorist subtexts.  Right there
in front of you, whether you wish to see it or not.

This past week in St. Louis has seen the death of the author and critic in
shocking sequence: first the critic, then the author.

Jack Buck, hall of fame radio announcer and commentator for the St. Louis
Cardinals, died last week of complications related to lung disease; he was
77.  Later in the week Darryl Kile, an ace pitcher for the Cardinals, died
suddenly in his sleep at 33. The city has been in a daze.  The stadium is
surrounded with hand-drawn signs, bouquets, heaps of stuffed animals, and
other strange tithes brought by fans to memorialize their fallen heroes.

This may seem a facetious response to Maria's question, "what does the death
of the author, which has been a critical commonplace since 1968, mean to
poets, poetry and poetics?"  but I don't intend it to be.  I often think of
myself as a batter standing at the plate when I write-- a poem is like an
at-bat. I take a few cuts, and if I strike out, I know I'll bat again later.
If I hit the ball, I'm trying to drive it into a gap and hopefully get extra
bases.  When I'm down two strikes I change my approach and just hope to make
contact.  Sometimes I hit a home run.  But my performance does not entirely
depend on any given at-bat; it's calculated statistically over a season, a
succession of seasons, a career.  And nothing depends entirely on my career
performance, either; there are other players, other teams, even other
sports.

Thinking of author/critic as player/announcer helps me remember that no
matter what people say about the decline of our nation's pastime, the game
goes on.  We had McGwire, we have Pujols.  We had June Jordan, we have
Rachel Loden.  We should celebrate the living as much as we memorialize the
dead.

Look, I know the "death of the author" idea isn't about physical death, but
it's possible to give too much attention to Barthes and others; my strategy
is to keep my head down and focus on my own game.  "Keep writing, kid," I
tell myself.  And then of course, I have a life outside of writing, too.
Authors and critics are part of a larger & more glorious system, as are the
texts they create. I think they only seem dead when they imagine they're the
only game in town.

David and Hitler
go to the planet Mars


David and Hitler go to the planet Mars. They see 2 fire balls and red
ash. They are both wearing protective glasses. They decide to go
swimming, but realize there is no water on Mars. David asks, "How come?
I can have a coke at home." "I don't know," says Hitler.

They go to the rocketship and set sail. Their rocket spins in the air
and crashes. They see more fire balls and red ash and are stunned.

They are alone on the planet with only fire balls. They saved their
suits from the rocket and put them back on. They can now go swimming in
their fire suits.

Water is spraying out of their rocket. They collect the water in
buckets. Probes and satellites from the earth take over. Kennedy, the
President, comes to visit. Kennedy refuses to give them money because
they broke the rocketship. David and Hitler are mad.

David and Hitler see canals and go to them, just plain dry land canals,
no water. They are sad because they can't find water.

Hitler kills Kennedy because he hates him and because Kennedy didn't
even bring a canteen of water with him.

David and Hitler jump on a satellite and probe and return to Earth. They
ask, "What time is it?" Then they go buy a beer and say. "Yah. Packey."
"No, you're Packey."

Doesn't this make the critic the top dog? If the author is dead, the critic

that's exactly it!  so i'd think that that would leave "evaluative
criticism" high and dry, where it already is.  i'm puzzled about ongoing
attachment to it; where is this coming from???

Whether you're "dead" or "alive," the important thing is to keep doing the
work. I choose my creative path and read the theorists later. Sometimes I
find them useful in refining my craft or seeing where my work fits in
relations to others'. But no matter the intensity of the evaluation, nobody
has a lock on truth, Whitman of course being one the best examples in
history (which I hear is also dead). I've received enough reviews of my work
in which the reviewer is afraid to say anything good or bad to appreciate
any attempt at evaluation, even if I vehemently disagree with it. Evaluation
of work continues discussion of it and contributes to the evolution of the
form it discusses.

Martha Ronk, the well-known Los Angeles poet wrote me, suggesting:

Since I'm working with Paul [Vangelisti] and others on organizing the =
conference for
October 10-12th on Place as Purpose: Poetry of the Western States at The =

Museum and Otis College, I'd like to
see work on Place, the West, Joan Didion's hot dry wind and paranoia.

Although I've certainly been influenced by Los Angeles, particularly =
after having now
lived here some seventeen years, I've rarely written about the place, or =
any place. I did
include an earthquake (and fire and riot) in one of my Santa Catalina =
"heavy sonnets,"
but generally I'm not interested in recreating landscape. I probably =
have palms in several
of my poems, but wordscapes matter more to me that a realistic "set." =
However, perhaps
I've been here long enough, and I do feel that the landscape plays an =
important role to
some poets here who I greatly admire, including Martha and Rae =
Armantrout. So, I thought
I'd try it.

Being here is hearing being when
the sea sets and wind runs into the house
to hide: everything is red. Blood
someone once said of every dead indian.
There's no doubt I drink too much.
Here. Being here I'm becoming biblical.
The locust threaten to descend. The fires
of early evening create a kind of cozy
campfire upon which we cremate all
that might have occurred to us. There is no news
that hasn't already happened. Still--
and that is the amazing thing, even a house
away from sunset--there is a kind of sweetness
in the chill, a jacarandad scent that settles
over ahead: and we believe even at the edge
of our continent we can push forward more, just
a little bit more, yet
we fortuitiously forget
and fall back into the sling
of askewed arms. Shhhh, someone says
pointing a gun at my head, don't move.
I don't. I never will again.

I just want to offer unsolicited testimonial: The
Shrubberies is a really brilliant and beautiful book.
As scandalous as it is to say--considering how
excellent everything RJ wrote is--I think it is the
best of his books.

I am hereby directing all of you to order this book.

Thank you, Aaron, for bringing up Jack Buck.
Buck's work was a masterpiece of rhetoric, especially if you ever heard it
in the backwaters of America on a cheap AM radio (going in and out) late at
night, spelling out some late-inning play. You could see the field, the
players, the game.

When I think of someone like Buck (and the others) doing what they did (do),
I KNOW poetry's authenticated by posterity and the unfettered all of us
(...and all the others in us). Dickens was spot on: "The people have set
literature free." To which I'd add: The people make it live.

And this suggest a mission: an endless speech -- the speech we had, the
speech we have, and the speech we'll have. Many things can put us in the
ditch -- language is one of them (you know the others...). But we climb out
of the ditch when the adventurous outsider (Ronald Johnson, William Bronk,
etc.) reward us with their blooming vagrancy into the unexpected. If you
don't see it where you are, look elsewhere -- or better still ( speaking of
"location") -- make it elsewhere.

Anyway, thank you Aaron.

maria, i suspect that now, more than ever, there's a desire (need?)
to find (new?) ways to assign value, no?... the flood of
information/material coming at us, let's face it, is rather
astounding (this can be a controversial point, as some historians
will want to observe that we've always been saturated with
information, if differently---but i'll hold at least to the sense
that many of us have that ours is a qualitatively different
postindustrial-global environs in this regard)... we could talk about
same in terms of push/pull technologies, and the degree to which the
web/internet is morphing into a push technology... e.g., every day
online brings me half a dozen unsolicited spams (of zero *value* to
me, and many incl. attachments)... you too?... this wasn't the case
even 3 years ago...

i registered a script at writer's guild the other day---you can do
this online now---and another script the day after... the difference
in script registration numbers was 212---meaning, i'm pretty sure i
have this right, that 212 scripts had been registered online at wga
in 24 hrs... the registration numbers are in the high 6 figures...
leonard maltin's guide to tv and video boasts something like 20,000
films reviewed (of varying quality---as we're all only too aware)...
so wga has logged something like 40 times this many scripts...

how does one weed through same to decide which to produce?...
production understood, at least initially, in terms of marketability
(however loathsome a concept), and marketability refined via focus
groups and the like (again), the point is that there is an evaluative
mechanism in place, you bet... one wants to know how it works, one
needs to know how it works, if one is to sell scripts...  if one is
to write scripts?---of course... i mean, unless you have no interest
in producing same...

we can pretend, if we wish, that such is not the case in poetry
publishing---that such is not the case at any phase of the process
from generation to reception of poetry (reception become a key issue
in the wake of the death of the author, no?)... that one writes what
one needs to, let's say, and only afterward is thought given to where
to place same (i've worked this way mself at times---sorta)... a
colleague of mine once told me that he didn't believe writers who
claimed that they couldn't get their work published---in essence,
that if they couldn't get it published, it was b/c their work wasn't
good enough, period... i couldn't disagree more---but my point is
that said colleague put absolute faith in the judgmental integrity of
the publishing world... i don't...

now if you can't locate a publisher, you might start to ask why... if
you're lucky enough to locate a publisher, you might wish to know how
your work ends up in stores, and purchased by a readership (if you're
lucky enough, again)... i.e., you may wish to understand, or seek to
imagine, your imagined readership/community, which isn't always a
fiction either (as somebody is laying out cold hard cash for your
scribbles, or you're sending your scribbles gratis to a being with
lungs)... my hunch, though, is that some conception of this circuit
is at work during the generative process (and i would say that some
conceptions of this circuit are downright faulty)... how it's at work
will vary---the point is that it's there, however buried in one's
psyche...

which is all a roundabout way of saying, that the evaluative process
is at work from beginning to end---from deciding where to break a
line to passing judgment on a given reading (i go to a LOT of
readings, and while i think the most important thing is to support
the work of my friends and acquaintances, i never ever leave my brain
at the door... which is to say, i don't think it's a church, and i
have opines---strong opines---about what i'm listening to)...

i *will* observe, again, that the question of judgment ought never to
be rendered lightly or superciliously or absolutely... i value the
good review, which is often a judgmental review, and though i *do*
see a place for the capsule summaries, largely positive, that one
used to find in ~taproots review~ (luigi-bob?), and currently finds,
in the main, in ~rain taxi~ (where most of the reviews are, again,
positive, and serve an important informational function), i think
it's important too, given the deluge we're experiencing (or feel
we're experiencing), to develop both a nurturing AND a critical
sensibility...

can you have a critical sensibility in the absence of judgment?---i
really don't think so... so the trick would be to render judgment w/o
being, shall we say?  judgmental... to remain sensitive to and
supportive of the difficulties of doing poetic (artistic) work ca.
2002, but nonetheless to bring to what's before you a principaled
understanding of what's most desirable, whether socially or
aesthetically or _____... to make such predilections/valuations
legible in fact---and available to others...

otherwise, and here's a judgment for you, i find it likely that we're
all bound to be lost in space, together...

best,

joe

Michael Heller gave us a snip of a longer essay collected here:

http://www.culturalsociety.org/aspects.html

His bit ends like this:

<only by freeing ourselves from a heavy-handed premising of that future can
we be led into what Bloch calls "the unfated, or at least into a fate that can
be modified." "The unfated" is in itself a remarkable idea, worthy of further
contemplation from both the literary and philosophical-historical perspective.

As a potential for poetics, the idea is already prefigured in Keats' poet of
"negative capability" or, closer to Bloch's time, in Robert Musil's comments
in Precision and Soul on the poet Rilke."Rilke," he says, "leads us into the
future;" he gives us, "not prophecy," but an "anticipatory scent." For we are
not, Musil insists, "to be called again to this or that ideological fixity, but to
the unfolding of the creation and possibilities of the spirit.">

I reply:

I think this idea, this "unfated", seems much more to the point of the
possible to say than is the death of the myth of the author, which no longer
contains any hint of the "anticipatory." (If it ever really did.)

There is real potential, I think, in modifying the notions of the present that get
locked into phrases such as "the death of the author." Something for the art
to do. It's vital "yes" in the face of the theorized "no." Critical theory can
always only be Is-Becoming-Was, while the art object remains in the Will-Be-
Becoming-Is. Which is, or can be, tucked nicely into the "unfated." beautiful
phrase.

I like this "spirit" here as well. I look forward to the completed piece.

Best,
    JG

Philip Whalen from "Jimmy & Lucy's House of 'K' No. 9" (January, 1989, Friedlander & Schelling):

-- ABOUT WRITING AND MEDITATION --

I thought that I'd write books and make money enough from them to travel abroad and to have a private life of reading and study and  music.  I developed a habit of writing and I've written a great deal but I've got very little money for it.

With meditation I supposed that one could acquire magical powers.  Then I learned that it would produce enlightenment.  Much later, I found out that Dogen is somewhere on the right track when he tells us that the practice of zazen is the practice of enlightenment.  Certainly there's no money in it.  Now I have a meditation habit.

Jack Kerouac said that writing is a habit like taking dope.  It's a pleasure to write.  I usually write everything in longhand.  I like the feel of the pen working on the paper.  (I'm typing this because I'm not going to correct it, I'm just talking.)

In my experience these two habits are at once mutually destructive and yet very similar in kind.  I write for the excitement of doing it.  I don't think of an audience; I think of the words that I'm using, trying to select the right ones.  In zazen I sit to satisfy my sitting habit.  It does no more than that.  But while sitting, I don't grab on to ideas or memories of verbal phrases.  I simply "watch" them all go by.  They don't get written; they don't (or anyway, very seldom) trip the relay on my writing machinery.  Considering that I've spent more days in the past fifteen years sitting zazen than I have spent in writing, it's little wonder that I've produced few books during that time.

16:I:87


-- FRIDAY EVENING, 10 APRIL 1987 --

I become a poet by accident.  I never intended to be a poet.  I still don't know what it's all about.  If I wrote poetry at all it's because I could finish it at the end of the page.  Maybe it would run halfway down the next page but it would come to a stop.  What I wanted to do with writing was to write novels and make money like anybody else.  And now I find myself in this ridiculous industry of writing these incomprehensible doodles, and why anybody's reading them I can't understand.

As far as meditation is concerned I'm a professional.  I've been a professional since 1973.  And that's my job.  I find it very difficult to sell.  And that's interesting, that's another job I have, to sell you on this idea that it's a good idea to sit.  That's where the poetry maybe comes into all this, that it has to be an articulation of my practice and an encouragement to you to enter into Buddhist practice.  To get yourselves trapped into it -- I hope.  And then try to figure out how to get out of it.  It's harder to get out of Buddhist practice than it is to get out of writing poetry.

I hardly write anything at all, except sometimes I write in a journal and I say the sun is shining or something like that, or recently Michael McClure was in town and we had a nice time, or the flowers are blooming.  And so I don't have much to say because I talk all the time.  I have to give lectures, I participate in seminars, and I have not much chance to wander up and down a hillside picking flowers and picking my nose and scratching my balls and whatnot.  ANd thinking of *hearing*, having a chance to *hear* what's going on around me, or hearing people in restaurants or on a bus.  There are no restaurants in Santa Fe worth sitting in, there are no buses at all.  So I don't hear anymore, hardly at all, unless I travel.  Like I was recently in New York and around, and now I'm here, and it's very interesting to *hear* what's going on outside.  While Gail or somebody was talking there was a robin outside raising hell.  BUt that doesn't mean anything.  I mean I'm not about to 
 write a poem about how so-and-so was talking, then a robin outside was raising hell.  It's strange, it's just naturally that way.

And so I'm here under false pretences on about four levels.  You're going to have to deal with that however you can.  I'm quite willing to talk to people and explain things to people if they have a question or a problem.  Or site doltishly looking out the window.  So you're going to have to, if you want something from me, try to get it.  Because I'm not about to offer anything.  I don't *have* anything to offer.  I'm sorry.  That's the emptiness part.

There's a great misunderstanding about what emptiness is, the idea that emptiness is something that happens under a bell-jar when you exhaust all the air out of it.  THat's not quite where it's at as far as I understand it.  The emptiness is the thing we're full of, and everything that you're seeing here is empty.  Literally the word is *shunya*, something that's swollen up -- is *not*, as often translated, void.  It's packed, it's full of everything.  Just as the idea in Shingon Buddhism, the idea that everything we see and experience and so forth *is* Mahavairochana Buddha, the great and unmanifest, unborn Buddha, is what we're actually living and seeing *in*.  Wallace Stevens said, "We live in an old chaos of the sun."  Well we're living in a live chaos of Mahavairochana Buddha.  So leave it or not.  What are you gonna do with it?  How are you gonna handle that?

Okay that's enough, thank you.


-- SATURDAY MORNING, 11 APRIL 1987 --

I am Philip Whalen, how do you do?  My Buddhist name is Zenshin Ryufu which is very impressive.  The reason that you have a name like that is you keep forgetting it and it makes you wonder about why you got it and why it's for you, because it's a very exalted idea.  Zenshin means "meditation mind" and it's also a Japanese pun.  It means something like "complete Mind."  There's also a Zenshin essay by Dogen.  Ryufu is two Chinese characters that literally mean "Dragon Wind" but in Chinese literature I found out it means "imperial influence" or "universal influence."  It's pretty complicated, and you wonder, well what does that have to do with me?  Four words -- Zen Mind Dragon Wind.  What in the world, what connection does that have with this individual who has received this name and is ordained as a monk?  So that is a problem that becomes more or less clear as you continue being a monk -- what your name is.  And of course names and poetry all come together.  Gertrude Stein s
 ays poetry is calling the name of something.  That's what we do all the time actually, is call ourselves.  There's the story of the Zen master who every day would call his own name.  He'd say, "Zuigan!"  And he'd say, "Yes!"  "Zuigan!  Don't be misled by other people!"  Well of course the other people were Zuigan too.

I like the idea somebody mentioned of erratic practice.  It immediately reminded me of the kind of rocks that show up on the glaciers, that have been left around when the glaciers recede.  These big rocks lying around on the countryside -- and you know, being a boulder, or like they say, a burnt out stump, for ten years or something, is a good thing.  People don't notice, do they?  A lot of time you want zazen to be an erratic boulder.  You can always do that.  But a lot of time sitting out in a field there are no other rocks.  It's a very strange appearance.  You can't account for it -- how the rock got there -- unless you remember the glacier that carried the rock there and then went away.

I have a number of fancy titles at the Dharma-sangha in Santa Fe.  But when push comes to shove it means that I'm the person who goes down and does the opening ceremony in the zendo every morning and sits two periods.  And then I go down again at 5:30 in the evening and sit again with whoever shows up.  And the rest of the time study.  We have two seminars a week with Baker Roshi on the koans in the *Shoyoruku* as translated by Thomas Cleary.  I've also been studying with Baker Roshi closely for the last three years with the intention at last of trying to become a Buddhist teacher, to help get this show on the road, which is still very precarious in this country.  The chances as I see it of Buddhism simply becoming something that people do on Sunday just like Methodism or Baptism or Catholicism are very strong.  But I hope that there will continue to be centers in the country like Tassajara, or Shasta Abbey, or Mt. Baldy.  There will be these hidden spots around the country w
 here people can hide out and do more serious, concentrated practice, to keep the door open for everybody to get the chance to try it out, find out what it's like to not do anything except follow a particular schedule and do a lot fo sitting and a lot of physical work.  This is something that I think is necessary in order for human beings to go on being human beings.  So far all we've been able to invent in the United States is the business of building small cabins in the woods and going there to hide out, then come back and write a book about it.  This has happened a number of times, including one which is completely unobtainable, on of the best.  It's a little book by Ebbe Borregard called *Lean-To*.

Anyhow, that practice, that sort of individual, hermit, erratic practice, is something that's really important.  The danger of outfits like Zen Center or monasteries or city centers and all that, is that people will take them seriously as being real.  People should invent their own.  People should maybe start out in an official place, but they should find out somehow that we don't need the official business, the organizations, the license, or authorization.  You've got to invent it.  It's exactly like Lew Welch says in his poem about the rock out there, the Wobbly Rock.  He says, "Somebody showed it to me and I had to find it myself."  The quote isn't exact.  Be sure and look it up, it's in Lew's book *Ring of Bone*.  "Somebody showed it to me and I found it myself."  Something like that.  Lew was an erratic practitioner -- who was a great poet.

The real tension, I think, is between official poetry, you know, such as we're taught in school and we put in libraries and so on, and which we really believe in -- and then there's what we do, and what our friends do, and the same thing holds for meditation.  What we discover for ourselves and learn.  At some point you can forget it and go off and make a pot of spaghetti, like we used to do when we'd go down here to Muir Beach years ago and gather muscles off the rocks and build a bonfire and put seaweed on the bonfire and steam the mussels and eat them and jump up and down in the waves and have fun.  That was... enough.  Probably enough.  Or too much.  Oh I guess Blake said it -- "Enough, or too much."

That's all.

Can't help remembering one morning before dawn when I went to the Zen

meeting on the lawn outside, maybe 10 of us standing in a circle, simply
discussing the business of the day, Philip a little gruff with the broken

Perelman's words in Lowell's mouth ("Fake Dreams: Victory," Future of
Memory, p. 56):

"I'm overexposed now, with critics crawling
between my lines.  Get a life,

then get it over with!  Follow
me, you bad singularities, worse infinities!

If you want a career, die!"

What these lines (and the rest of the poem) convey is a particular form of
poetic anxiety.  The anxiety is that a total commitment to writing, such as
the one Lowell made, is connected to a desire for death.  Egoism and the
concern for reputation seem to embody a death wish.  "If you want a career,
die."  Recall Auden's quip about Berryman's suicide note: Your move, Cal.
I think Perelman wants to find a way out of all these notions.  Clearly he
wants the relation between poets and critics to be something other than
that between corpses and maggots.

But it seems to me that Lowell's life still stands as a kind of challenge
to contemporary poets, especially those with academic careers.  (If you
don't like Lowell, then think of Beckett.)  The challenge is -- I'm not
sure I can articulate it -- but it has to do with an idea of artistic
commitment, one which is somehow at odds, for example, with the mentality
that justifies life in terms of human relationships (Perelman begins his
poem by calling attention to his own identity as parent and spouse).  There
_is_ a connection between poetry and nihilism.  This is difficult to talk
about, but it seems to be grounded in reality, whereas the "death of the
author" cliche is not.

My sense is that the epitaph for authors is manifest
in a post-ownership ontology which has not yet fully
pervaded our sensibilities. Theoretically, we're no
longer discrete monads manipulating signs in a
solipsistic laboratory and more on the order of
collaborative performers who, intentionally or not,
are wired into a matrix of allusiveness. The
information age is about access and not possession,
interrelation and not understanding, and in such a
climate the cult of genius has been shown to be a
misappropriation of what it means to be writerly or
readerly.

So in a way, the film industry has a leg up on us,
because they at least acknowledge the many minds that
need come together to produce a work. Though actors or
directors may receive all the credit, it is a given
that myriad others are vital for the exsitence of a
film; similarly, a poet is nothing without the
critical atmosphere (s)he is rec'd in and the
"canonicity" of a work is directly proportional to the
dialogue it engenders; for some reason, as writers, we
are less likely to acknowledge this fact.

When more meanings proliferate, when poems, like
poets, are seen in process and not outside of time,
when criticism is not seen as parasitic or
supplementary but rather as part of the poems under
discussion, then the death of the author equals more
life for the text.

thanx for surfacing the collaborative aspects of filmmaking, ravi...
part of the reason i'm harping on same... as to digital
access/interrelation replacing print possession/understanding, i
would say that this is, in many ways, a worthy goal... i wouldn't
give up on possession/understanding, but if we're talking a matter of
emphasis, the best of the online world probably works more along the
axis you suggest...

i'm reminded that anything can be registered through wga (writers
guild)---treatments etc... which means that the script #'s may be
lower than i suggested... nevertheless, the odds are daunting, and
there is a ruthless evaluative mechanism in place for weeding through
this lot in order to ascertain which items might provide sufficient
r-o-i (if at the expense of quality)...

Chaos is always possible to confound the supposed inevitable rule of money
and power.  Sometimes dreams become reality and reality, dreams.  And
perhaps these "things" (if we can call them "things")--money, power, chaos,
dreams, and reality--are inseparable.  Or perhaps all of these things
possess their own universes inside their own meanings.

Are you confused by what I'm saying?  I surely am.  Sometimes I think my
confusion is my only certainty.

Of course your "hate to break it to you folks" is about 99.9% right.  Just
that little 0.1% is what I was concerned with.

We both nod in agreement. Yes?

Well . . . 1968 itself is surely dead, witness the ferocity of those who prop up its corpse in order to kick it once more --

There has never been any criticism that is not in some significant sense evaluative -- though there is much criticism that attempts to present itself as plain statement of eternal verity rather than as proceeding from a set of aesthetic presuppositions --

There has never been any criticism that does not know that "texts" have been written by active agents, though it is not always possible to identify those agents --

Even Hirsch went from saying that the meaning of any text is what its author meant to saying that the meaning of any text is what its author probably meant --

The "Intentional Fallacy" had been published well before '68 --


There has been, however, an increasing effort over the past three decades or so to acknowledge the fact that both meaning and value are social relationships -- Like value of the dollar, the value of a poem is not something that inheres simply and unproblematically within the text itself -- Neither can the "meaning" of a poem be forever circumscribed within the horizon of what the "author" had in mind at the moment of composition.  (Who among us has not come to find something in our own poetry that we hadn't thought of when first writing it?)

I don't see anything threatening in critical efforts to come to sharper understandings of what we do when we "mean," "read," "write," "value" etc., despite my understanding that this is of necessity a never-ending effort ---

It's hard to get the news from poetry, but presidents, mullahs, reverends, the federalist society, the SAT & the GRE and supreme court justices would like to be sure that what can be gotten from reading poetry doesn't get gotten too often -- by too many --

Dear List Lovers,

I'm not at all offended by people posting creative work to Poetics.  I've
done it myself over the years I've been signed up to this wonderful list.
What I do object to is someone using this list as their own personal
publishing service when they can (and obviously do) have other outlets for
their texts.  I think it's wonderful for other people to post their work
here, and I welcome it.

I'm neither friend nor foe of Mr. Sondheim.  I'm just someone who pleads
that he not over-post his creative work. What's over-posting?  I leave that
up to Mr. Sondheim's common sense. The option of posting links to his
prolific output is also a good one, I think, and one that I would welcome.

Finally, when I simply delete something on my machine it goes to the deleted
file on my hard drive, so whether I choose to read Mr. Sondheim's work or
not, It still takes up space on my hard drive.

Love you all,

Jesse

One of the places it might be coming from is the human need to evolve a
hierarchy, perhaps toward a reinstitution of the family model within the
writer's professional context. That  would dovetail neatly into Murat's
point about top dogs. I think that this is also why the issue of anarchy
comes in so quickly in this discussion, as a reactive literary impulse
towards countering such authoritarian reinstatements. Joe Amato talks about
tens of thousands of scripts being placed online every 24 hours, did I get
that right? Wherever there is apparent chaos, someone will come along and
make a profession out of making lists and categories and offering value
judgments. I think a lot of this organizational stuff, this classificatory
and evaluative impulse is deadly for the writer. Very useful for the critic,
who can place ideas and creations neatly on the shelves and in the bookstore
windows, and into history. I'm thinking again of the issue of momentum. What
long term writer has not faced the complicated issue of inertia? Alan
Sondheim mentioned awhile back that he doesn't see any issue of bad
narcissism or good narcissism, but for him the issue comes back to feedback.
I often have the feeling that where I once thought I wanted feedback, now I
feel that that ordinary notion, that knee-jerk feeling that feedback would
kindle the flames of the imagination, was not quite accurate.  Perhaps what
I wanted was to break the feeling of writing in a vacuum, but I didn't
realize that the vacuum was coming from an equally strong need to allow
ideas to gestate and develop without interference. This is where I feel the
need for poetics comes in. Today I was reading around in -the New American
Poetry- edited by Donald M.Allen, especially looking at the Phillip Whalen
poems in there, but also remembering how important the section called
Statements on Poetics was to so many poets.  The section includes that
terrific line of Olson's quoted by Creeley- "One perception must immediately
and directly lead to a further perception." When I get involved with
discussions on poetics, ideas which have long been dormant start to light up
on my mental screen. Of course, not all these ideas lead anywhere, but I
don't need to have them  be so tightly ironed out in order for them to
energize me. Curiosity gets kindled. When Andrew Rathman made his
pronouncement about evaluative criticism getting people so high I felt a
strong urge to check this out historically. That research activity was
incredibly energizing. But I don't suppose that evaluative criticism got
Whitman very high. Sure, Whitman seemed able to turn anything into energy,
but, sadly, as I noticed in the Peyre quote, at least the English critics
were not so quick to help find ways to turn this energy into money. I also
noticed in the Peyre quote that only other authors seem to have offered
Whitman support in his lifetime. The spontaneous tendency for many authors
to offer each other response, especially when they have been moved or
impressed or energized by each others efforts, is what I am thinking of when
I think of poetics. By discussing ideas and works, including  exchanging
evaluations tempered by respect for the mysterious workings of literary
invention, I think writers can offer each other much more access to
enlivening momentum that they have by allowing themselves to be overly
dependent on professional critical activity or the hierarchical urges of
literary organizers.

An engagement with poetics has long been associated with the Language poets.
I received an interesting letter from Tracy Ruggles who gave me permission
to quote it.

I think one of the reasons that the poetics of the L-A poets has often
obtained such interest and impact is that the need for poetics created by
and for poets is so strong. It isn't that the need for contemporary poetry
is not strong. Poetics and critical theory written by poets has the
potential of offering a way that writers might work together to sustain
momentum in that shared issues and conflicts are surfaced often with some of
the magical inventiveness writers bring to their "solo" works. I don't think
it is the content alone of poetics that does this. It is the empowerment
that emerges when writers work together to break their isolation and
dependency for gaining feedback on fleeting sensations of professional
connection and recognition gained through reviews, book sales, academic
seminars, attendance at poetry readings or giving poetry readings, to name a
few examples. While all these activities are of crucial value I feel that
exchanging their own intensive ideas in poetics and critical theory offera
writers a way to move in the direction not of hand-holding as A. Rathman
puts it, but of offering each other a method of encouraging greater access
to kindling writerly momentum without so much emphasis being placed on
issues of quality  or the tracking of professional accomplishment.

The problem is I am very, very unlikely to buy a book I can't look at!
Especially from an author I don't know.  In the case of some presses, there
are authors I know, but I am still not sure I want their books.  I am
willing to buy books from the publisher to support the publisher-- I believe
in that.  But a positive review or a list of books just won't do it.  What
would make me buy the book is a PDF edition of the whole book online that I
can peruse which would convionce me that I want to own the book.  I know
you'd worry that people would read the PDF and no longer want to buy the
book, but that isn't likely with poetry.  People want to reread poetry, not
just read it once.  And they want to read it on nice paper, not on the
screen.  I write web art myself and am very open to reading on my screen,
but a regular poetry collection on screen does not make me feel the pleasure
of owning a book.  If I saw such a PDF file and I liked it, I would buy the
book.

Short of doing this (which may be beyond your technical capabilities
although all that is involved is buying the Acrobat program -- not the free
thing online but the writer you have to buy...), excerpts from the work
which indicate the breadth of the work would be good, along with a table of
contents.

Of course it isn't fair for you to have to do this while mainstream
publishers don't, but I can go to my local bookstore and look at a large
selection of ppoetry books published by mainstream publishers.
Unfortunately, small press distribution etc. are not that successful at
getting your books into stores.  If it is better for you for us to buy
diurectly from you, I will keep that in mind when buying a small press book
at my bookstore and will consider coming home and ordering it online from
the press.  But that is rather inconvenient.

I believe Coach House Press makes its books available online for free
already and I assume they are making money by doing it.

Dear All :

far (the first year of operation).

dollars, with free shipping:

    Ronald Johnson, THE SHRUBBERIES.
    Pam Rehm, GONE TO EARTH.
    Tom Pickard, HOLE IN THE WALL: New & Selected Poems.
    Philip Jenks, ON THE CAVE YOU LIVE IN.
    Fanny Howe, ECONOMICS [short stories].
    Paul Hoover, WINTER (MIRROR).

Alll books are finely printed, sewn paperbacks. Your money will contribute
directly to the printing of our next two books (by Robert Duncan and William
Fuller). Flood Editions is a nonprofit publisher.

If you are interested in this offer, or want to order individual titles,
please backchannel.

All the Best,
Devin Johnston

Interestingly, Tracy assumes that poetics precedes the poem ["poems (poetics
in practice)], instead of poetics being an extension of the poem -by the
poet- into social discourse in his/her terms. On Tracy's terms, poetics
taking over, overwhelming the writing of the poem is possible. But if poetics
is the creation of a rational for the already written (as something supremely
polemical, part of rhetoric, rather than "objective" discourse), then doesn't
the issue Tracy discusses become moot?

Jesse,

I am not the first defender of Alan's work, but the hard-drive-space
argument doesn't hold any water. Do you really worry about the size of your
"deleted file"? Does its size affect your overall computing experience?  Do
you know how large Alan's posts *are*, anyway?  His recent "Poet" weighed in
at under eight kilobytes.  A modern hard drive will be 20 gigabytes or more.

My vote is, stop bitching and delete them if you don't like them.

Happy hunting,everyone; I'll be away from my computer for a week.

Maria,

        The death of the author is, I believe, a fifties thing: that's when Barthes
(& a bit later, Foucault) began to formulate the idea. The fifties in France
were exactly as deadly as the fifties in the US. Barthes, a frustrated gay
writer, had to force himself into the critic-closet & his revenge was to
call the critic alive and the author dead. 1968 was in fact a lesson of
liberation taught to Barthes (& Foucault, & others of their generation) by
their students -- & after that date, Roland "Death of the Author" Barthes
came out & started to be an author (cf. "Fragments of an Amorous Discourse,"
" Barthes by Barthes" ((the resurection of the living dead author by the
dead alive critic, an amazing handjob))(((while Foucault went to SF for the
actual jouissance of MS, with unhappily lethal results))). The fact that the
"death of the author" is seen as a critical commonplace "since 1968" in this
country speaks essentially to the academic obtuseness & slowness of the US
who get the news late & thus imported a dead fifties idea  right after its
reactionary mechanisms had been deconstructed by the street events of 1968.
Or else you can read it as a strategic conservative move to renew the dead
New Criticism into a more elegant & alive looking New New Criticism, aka,
"theory", needed for a throughly discredited "English Department" to make a
new bid for power.

        As JR & I wrote in the intro to MILLENNIUM: "The deathof the author has
been much exagerated."

        Pierre

I have no problem with Alan Sondheim posting his work. If this is his only
venue for getting his aspect of his work out, he should have it. This list
is probably his best audience. Don't most of us need a larger audience than
we have? If I don't have time to read his postings, I delete them, then
empty the Deleted Items folder. That way, my hard drive doesn't get filled
up. Keep posting, Alan.

An excellent question.  They're as valid or invalid as anything else, i.e. no
absolute ground for validity exists.  The quality of an evaluation may be
lacking given a set of contingencies, but alter the set and . . . .  See?
Artists once slammed are suddenly the flavor of the decade.  And likewise the
reverse.  My guess is that once a work (or worker), through influence,
achieves institutionalization, it becomes very difficult to get rid of
him/her/it (though it does happen occasionally).  At that point aesthetic
value (which may continue to be debated) gives way to position in the
semiotics of history.  Eventually the march of minutes makes it near
impossible to go back in time and right a perceived wrong, even if the set of
contingencies has changed.  Human history (including literary history), we
all know if we're honest, is a record of wealth and influence.  Pick any
important literary figure, then "follow the money."  Is the history of art
since the 1920s authored by Picasso, Pollock, Ashbery, etc.?  Or rather by
Stein, Guggenheim, Auden et al and so forth?  And it never hurts for an
artist to have a few bucks of his/her own.  By the way, I've often wondered
what would happen if Norton went out of business.  Without those anthologies
supported by a wealthy publisher whose influence spans a considerable period
of time, would a major reshuffling occur?  Possibly, but the same market
forces would inevitably exert themselves.  If one is lucky enough to suffer
the gentler strokes, my response is, of course,  "Congratulations."  Best,
Bill

Gary Sullivan suggested a very interesting exercise in selecting a =
conventional poem, typing
it into my word processor, then cutting and pasting the poem into =
Babelfish (a translating service).
Then I was to command the text to be translated from English into =
German, then from German into
French, and then from French back into English, using the result as the =
source of a poem.
=20
I tried this several times, first with a poem by Alicia Ostriker. But =
even with all the oddities of
translation and strange word pairings the final was only a bit less =
tepid than the original. I tried
it then with a Robert Bly poem with somewhat better results. But it =
didn't rouse my curiosity=20
enough--a requirement for I put my name to poem.
=20
I finally took an early poem of Charles Bernstein's, "Ballet Russe," in =
which he purposely uses
some stereotypical and banal (yet somewhat intense) phrases from =
Nijinky's autobiography to quite humorous effects. The original reads:

I took these lines, putting them into paragraph form, translated them =
into German, translated the German in French, and then translated the =
French back into English. Because I could not always provide accents =
(umlauts, etc). certain words did not make the transitions, but remain =
basically in a kind of ur-German or ur-French. These I translated =
through my knowlege of the languages themselves and the Cassell's German =
dictionary--and sometimes a bit of imagination. The result was strange. =
The original came through quite strongly (which it had not in the =
Ostriker and Bly poems). But the subtle changes made the language all =

I'd be grateful for recommendations of work by emerging writers.  Or, if
not recommendations, then at least alerts to new publications.  Alert me to
yourself and I'll spread the word.  Here are some names I've earmarked for
possible bookbuying: Schaefer, Stefans, Robertson, Wagner, Sullivan/Gordon,
Kalleberg -- and I forget the rest of them...  Creeds and schools in
abeyance: I just want to know what's out there.  Thanks.

Note to Millie Niss:  Consumer confidence may be low, but Flood is always a
safe investment.  Good value for the money, no monkey business in the

They'll definitely weather this phase of the bubble - crash - legal

You are probably aware of the new publishing venture, the Marsh Hawk Press.
Young and older poets are included.  My own new book of poems, Drawing on the

The Net Effect   By Simson Garfinkel    July/August 2002

Big e-mail providers snap their fingers, and the masses obey, like sheep.=20
But there's a way to reclaim control.

This past March, I started getting dozens of e-mails from upset but=20
resigned AT&T Broadband customers. All said more or less the same thing:=20
their e-mail addresses were about to stop working. I had to update my=20
address book to change the letters after the @ sign from =93mediaone.net=94=
 to=20
=93attbi.com.=94

More than 630,000 AT&T customers were forced to make this change. [....]

[If they each told fifteen friends to change their address lists,
that's more than ten million changes that would need to be made. -- J.T.]

Few people realize just how much control over the increasingly pervasive=20
medium of e-mail they have tacitly conceded. Many, for instance, think that=
=20
they somehow own their e-mail addresses. Wrong! Legally and technically,=20
the company, university or individual who owns the computer systems behind=
=20
an e-mail address controls all aspects of the accounts it serves. In fact,=
=20
the addresses belong to the company whose name comes after the @. (In the=20
case of mediaone.net, AT&T relinquished the name to another Media One, an=20
advertising agency in Sioux Falls, SD, to settle a lawsuit.)

You may think you=92re entitled to an e-mail address because you=92ve=20
religiously paid some Internet service provider your monthly subscription=20
fee for years. That=92s not the case. Your provider can cancel your e-mail=
=20
account for any reason and bounce your e-mail. Or it can give your=20
username=97and your e-mail!=97to somebody else. Or it can lock you out of=
 your=20
account and read your e-mail without your permission. (Having owned a small=
=20
Internet service provider since 1995, I know well the responsibilities and=
=20
dilemmas that come with this awesome power.)

In one case that I know [....] a friend lost her Internet account after she=
=20
got into an argument with the firm providing her Internet service. But=20
rather than canceling her username, the provider simply changed her=20
password. Mail to her old address accumulated for months, unread. People=20
who send messages to her old address still get the response that her=20
mailbox is full.

E-mail is tremendously different from the two other addressing systems that=
=20
we use routinely=97postal addresses and telephone numbers. Because postal=20
addresses are covered by a huge body of regulations and laws, and because=20
most are linked to physical locations, they work pretty much the way we=20
expect them to [....]

Telephone numbers [....] are increasingly regarded by law as the property=20
of the person or organization to which they connect. In fact, the 1996 U.S.=
=20
Telecommunications Act specifically requires telephone companies to create=
=20
a framework for telephone number portability, so that businesses and=20
residences can switch phone service providers without losing their phone=20
numbers.

But the Telecommunications Act was silent on the subject of e-mail=20
addresses. The U.S. Congress didn=92t think to mandate e-mail address=20
portability. It didn=92t even mandate the next best thing=97e-mail=
 forwarding.=20
If you are an America Online user and decide that you want to switch to=20
another Internet provider, the only thing you can do is send mail to all of=
=20
your correspondents, telling them of your new address. AOL will not forward=
=20
your mail.

What=92s so distressing about this state of affairs is that there is a=
 simple=20
solution to the problem of e-mail address portability. Every person and=20
every company should get a unique domain name.

Recall that the domain name is the part of the e-mail address after the @=20
sign. [....]

Nowadays you can get your own domain name for less than $25 a year from any=
=20
of a number of companies. And these names are portable=97that is, you can=20
take them with you from one Internet service provider to another.

Of course, people are taught to be sheep for a reason. Customers tied to=20
@attbi.com or @aol.com addresses are inhibited from switching to a rival=20
service provider=97which ultimately means that the companies don=92t have to=
=20
compete as hard. That=92s why neither AT&T nor AOL has worked to make it=
 easy=20
for customers to have their own domains.

In the 21st century, having your own domain name is simple electronic=20
self-defense. Alas, many people find it easier to be sheep.

if anyone does plan on purchasing a domain name, stay away from Network
Solutions / Verisign. not only do they have a history of holding domains
hostage (by making it as difficult as possible to change any information
with your name), but they repeatedly engage in deceptive marketing
practices. not to mention that you can find other registrars who provide the
same service (with better quality) for more than half of what verisign
charges.

not to mention that not all domain registrars provide e-mail services, so
more often than not you will need to find some way to have mx records
associated with your domain, allowing your spiffy new @whatever.com to
either forward your e-mail to your isp account, or provide a way for you to
check your e-mail online (such as paying for an actual hosting account
somewhere). there are quite a few hosting providers who offer incredibly
cheap hosting packages that would be perfect for an e-mail only web-space.

so if this is the route someone wants to go, shop around....

Recall that the domain name is the part of the e-mail address after the @
sign. [....]

Nowadays you can get your own domain name for less than $25 a year from any
of a number of companies. And these names are portable-that is, you can
take them with you from one Internet service provider to another.

Of course, people are taught to be sheep for a reason. Customers tied to
@attbi.com or @aol.com addresses are inhibited from switching to a rival
service provider-which ultimately means that the companies don't have to
compete as hard. That's why neither AT&T nor AOL has worked to make it easy
for customers to have their own domains.

In the 21st century, having your own domain name is simple electronic
self-defense. Alas, many people find it easier to be sheep.

I was not questioning the quality of their books.  I knew some authors and
they seemed unassailable.  But I don't buy poetry books sight unseen.  And I
haven't seen their books at my independent bookstore.  Maybe I would if I
had more money, but I'm on disability and I can only buy a few a month.

I'd be grateful for recommendations of work by emerging writers.  Or, if
not recommendations, then at least alerts to new publications.  Alert me to
yourself and I'll spread the word.  Here are some names I've earmarked for
possible bookbuying: Schaefer, Stefans, Robertson, Wagner, Sullivan/Gordon,
Kalleberg -- and I forget the rest of them...  Creeds and schools in
abeyance: I just want to know what's out there.  Thanks.

Note to Millie Niss:  Consumer confidence may be low, but Flood is always a
safe investment.  Good value for the money, no monkey business in the
boardroom, numbers you can trust.  A real company with real assets.
They'll definitely weather this phase of the bubble - crash - legal
response cycle.  As outside auditor, I bless their books.

Evaluations can be useful, as long as you're aware that the ground of their
validity might shift.  One has to understand that the relation of the critic
to the writer can affect the evaluation. The relation of one critic to
another can affect the reputation of a writer unknown to either. In "The
Literary Situation" Malcolm Cowley wrote that writers' reputations rise and
fall like fads.

If you consider all works issued by major publishers to be issued for
profit, then the evaluations are not so much evaluations of the merit of a
work in the context of literature as a whole, but as the merit of a work
that fits within the range of literature published by major presses for
commercial reasons.. This of course narrows the range of what much useful
criticism could be. As they say, history is written by the winners. I've
been fortunate enough to hear and read "the other side" of history, and, on
occasion, witness the difference between official accounts and what actually
happened. The limitation of who writes history is unfortunate because
excellent authors such as Edward Mannix and Henry Kanabus (and countless
others) will only find readers in the dustiest corners of used bookstores,
if at all.

Even though I personally wish I had more luck, I don't begrudge people
theirs. I know how much hard work it takes to be in a position to have any
luck at all.

Best,

Vernon

Since Douglas Messerli has been so busy writing poems on the net, I (Per =
Bregne) have been
called upon to report some new publications from Green Integer and Sun & =
Moon Press.
=20
First of all, check out the excellent new review of The Pretext by Rae =
Armantrout that Charles
Alexander did for on-line magazine Jacket. It ends: "Armantrout is =
generally associated with language
poetry, but if we widen our lens, we might as well think of her =
alongside Wyatt, Dickinson, Oppen--
other poets who compose intelligent, tough, uncompromising, and =
immaculately constructed
lyrics concerned with who and what we are, and how we are in the world." =

      To check out the whole review download it at  =
http://jacketmagazine.com/18/alex-arma.html
=20
We offer a 20% discount on The Pretext. With shipping (of $1.25) that =
would mean the book
would cost $9.21. Write the check to EL-E-PHANT (not to Green Integer) =
and send to Green Integer,
6022 Wilshire Boulevard #200A, Los Angeles, CA 90036. PLEASE NOTE: =
THAT'S A NEW ADDRESS
FOR SUN & MOON AND GREEN INTEGER. Just upstairs from where we were!
=20
We also have a number of new books now available.
=20
The ever-popular Notes on the Cinematographer by Robert Bresson has been =
reprinted
(its third printing in Green Integer) at he original price of $8.95.
=20
Two classics have now joined the Green Integer list: Civil Disobediance =
by Henry David Thoreau
has been published (in a new printing) for a price of $6.95. The Song of =
Songs: Shir Hashirim
has been published, translated by noted classical scholar Willis =
Barnstone. If you recall, he also
translated our edition of Sappho's Poems.
=20
If you use either of these books in your courses, please consider using =
the Green Integer edition.


In fiction, Green Integer has announced three new titles:=20
=20
Meeting at the Milestone by Norwegian novelist Sigurd Hoel is a 6 x 9 =
EL-E-PHANT Green Integer
priced at $15.95. In this moving and profound novel, Sigurd Hoel =
explores patriotism and treason through the major character's memories =
of the Resistance Movement in Nazi-occupied Norway during World War II. =
At the dark center of this work are questions of why certain individuals =
turn against their own country, their own values, their very selves. =
Hoel, who was himself active in the Resistance, has created a complex =
web of fact and fiction in which the "good" Norwegians and the traitors =
are not always easily distinguishable. This is an absorbing tale of =
adventure, set in a fateful time, by the author of The Road to the =
World's End (published by Sun & Moon) and The Troll Circle. The book has =
been wonderfully translated by Sverre Lyngstad, who also translated =
several of Sun & Moon's and Green Integer's titles by Knut Hamsun.
=20
Lee Breuer, founder and co-director of the innovative theater group =
Mabou Mines, has written a crazy new novel La Divina Caricatura =
published by Green Integer for $14.95. Related to his successful plays =
Ecce Porco, The Shaggy Dog Animation, Prelude, and Epidog, La Divina =
Caricatura is the first two parts of a trilogy of
fictions that Breuer describes as "a loose sendup of Dante, with an =
Inferno, a Purgatorio, and Paradiso. But instead of being sequential, =
they are intercut. And the main characters each have their own =
realm--the dog is in hell, the pig is in purgatory, and the ant (who =
will figure in part 3)...is in heaven." As The New York Times described =
his play, which opened at Breuer's Mabou Mines just previous to this =
publication, La Divina Caricatura is "a comic spectacle...an acid-trip =
collage of philosophy, mythology, corny jokes and lyric poetry." But the =
chaotic structure of the work definitely creates an energy that is at =
once hilariously funny and, if not tragic, animated by the pathos of =
living at the beginning of a century which at times appears heading =
toward terror.
=20
The collaborative team Ascher/Straus has produced a new fiction, ABC =
Street published by Green Integer at $10.95.
Authors of The Menaced Assissin, The Other Planet and Red Moon/Red Lake, =
the noted collaborative team contemplates the materials of the writer's =
life--"what gets cannibalized into fiction but doesn't get treated as =
fiction itself"--in this new work, which explores the boundary between =
novel and notebook. A novel that takes up the tasks of the journal can =
also be read as a journal that documents the materials in the novel. In =
ABC Street the narrative of place and life of the mind work together to =
build up a panoramic view of related lives with no epic pretensions.
=20
Douglas Messerli's book of poetry Bow Down has just been published by =
the Italian publisher ML&NLF. The book, done in collaboration with Los =
Angeles artist John Baldessari, appears in a bi-lingual edition of =
Italian and English with photgraphs of several of Baldessari's works, =
particularly those on which Messerli focused.=20
    Actually there are two major structural focuses in this work. =
Dedicated to the Italian poet Amelia Rosselli, who
committed sucide in 1996, Bow Down was written in response to several =
black-and-white Baldessari collages
and written "through" the poems of various Italian authors translated =
into English, including Mario Luzi, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Andrea =
Zanzotto, Milos de Angelis, Adriano Spatola, and many others. The book =
sells for $12.95.
=20
Finally (in two respects) Anthem by Washington, D.C. area poet Jean =
Donnelly has been published by Sun & Moon Press for $11.95. Winner of =
the 2000 National Poetry Series, selected by Charles Bernstein, this =
book is, as Bernstein wrote: "Fresh as the first moment of the rest of =
your life, where invention is an attribute of grace and the intimacy of =
the newly coined rules the roost. O say can you see the charms bursting =
in ear."
=20
All of these titles can be ordered from Green Integer at a 20% discount =
plus $1.25 each for postage. As I mentioned
above, please make the check or money order out to EL-E-PHANT (Green =
Integer's legal name) and send it to the
new address: 6022 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 200A, Los Angeles, CA 90036.
=20
Thanks for the opportunity to share these titles with you.

I'm going to see if I can cc New Poetry, which CP is actually on --

am currently reading Antliff's ANARCHIST MODERNISM:  Art, Politics, and the
First American Avant-Garde, which is primarily a work of art history, and has
some huge flaws, especially where WCW in particular and women in general and
poetry in general and little magazine history are concerned, however

he's got this argument that the pre-WWI anarchy espoused by particularly the
ashcan painters like Bellows and Henri (who were starting un-curated shows as
well as "independent" or refuses shows), (poet Lola Ridge,) The New Freewoman
/ The Egoist, against the "standards" of the academy, was for untrammelled
free expression and individualism.  While Kreymborg, Pound, et.al. were
writing criticism of the new work, it was substantively different from "old
fashioned" academic art criticism of the time -- focussed not on standards or
technique, but on philosophies the work embodied, movements and value to the
movements, and the individual situation of each artist.

Pound opened his 1914 article in THE EGOIST on Edward Wadsworth "by
celebrating vorticism as 'a movement of individuals, for individuals, for the
protection of individuality.'" p 82

1912-ish, Steiglitz pled for a modernism informed by anarchism, one "without
regard for ... authority" p. 36

P.S.  Lola Ridge:  reviews of Red Flag and Dance of Fire still wanted.

"I shall expound the phrase avasavattanatthena-anatta. As these flashes of
lightning do not last long and do not possess essence, they will not yield
to one's wishes. Just as it is not proper for one to say that these
flashes of lightning will listen to one's words and that one has control
over them, the physical and mental phenomena contained in the five consti-
tuent groups of existence being impermanent, will not yield to the wishes
of anyone. So it is not proper for one to delusively consider that the
five constituent groups of existence will obey one's orders or that one
has sway over then." (Sammadtthi Dipani, The Manual of Right Views, Ledi
Sayadaw.)

Genre Bending with Cixous by Rebecca Clouse

"Cixous: "Flying is woman's gesture-flying in language and making it fly. =
We
have all learned the art of flying and its numerous techniques; for
centuries we've been able to possess anything by flying; we've lived in
flights, stealing away, finding, when desired, narrow passageways, hidden
crossovers. It's no accident that voler has a double meaning [to fly, to
steal], that it plays on each of them and thus throws off the agents of
sense..."
