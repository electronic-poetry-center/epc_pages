So what do you make of this?

ja?

November 1, 2005
Turbulence Commission: "Exegesis" by Kushal Dave
http://turbulence.org/works/exegesis
Needs Java 1.4 + [see http://turbulence.org/works/exegesis/about.html for
other technical recommendations]

"Exegesis" is an attempt to understand how people quote the Bible - which
parts they choose to quote, and why. It highlights the portions that appear
most often on the web and presents excerpts from some of them.

The Bible is quoted in a range of contexts: political, academic, scientific,
ethical, literary, and, of course, religious. All are on display, along with
careful discussion about the meanings and implications of every line. Where
the Bible is used to persuade, Dave is particularly interested in whether it
is treated as a set of facts and literal dictates, or as an eloquent
expression of subjective ideas. Many pages examine the subtleties,
ambiguities and contradictions in the Bible, while others make explicit
statements such as "God Hates Fags." "Amidst all this, though," says Dave,
"a picture of a beautiful and inspirational Bible emerges, with popular
passages seemingly just as likely to be encouraging as proscriptive."

"Exegesis" places a set of rules in motion. No editorial selection is
applied.

"Exegesis" is a 2005 commission of New Radio and Performing Arts, Inc., (aka
Ether-Ore) for its Turbulence web site. It was made possible with funding
from the Murray G. and Beatrice H. Sherman Charitable Trust.

The final reading of Gloria Gervitz'  East Coast tour. A remarkable poet.




Friday, November 4 at 6:15 p.m., at the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center=
=20
of NYU, with Chilean poet Marjorie Agos=EDn. Both poets will be introduced=
 by=20
Mark Schafer. Bilingual reading.

Reception to follow.

_____________________________________________________________





Gloria Gervitz, one of the most important Mexican poets of the post-Paz=20
generation, will present her book-length poem Migraciones in a bilingual=20
reading with her translator, Mark Schafer. Migraciones, at times frankly=20
and lushly erotic in the tradition of both the 17th-century mother of all=20
post-conquest Mexican poetry in Spanish, Sor Juana In=E9s de la Cruz, and of=
=20
modern Mexican feminism, for which the erotic has become a way of=20
reclaiming the body, is a complex interweaving of personal and family=20
memory, Biblical reference, the mystical traditions of the Judaism of her=20
family and the folk Catholicism of her paternal grandmother, who, like the=
=20
other women of Gervitz' ancestry, rises to the surface of the poem like a=20
ghost of the imagination. Written from within Mexico's displaced Eastern=20
European Jewish community, it is, as Jerome Rothenberg has said, "an epic=20
of the migratory self," an almost thirty-year journey of the nomadic=20
spirit, and an ecstatic arrival. With its mixed parentage and its sense of=
=20
displacement, the journey is at once profoundly Mexican, and profoundly=20
American, the discovery of a new internal place where warring selves may be=
=20
brought together.



Mark Schafer has given us a translation, itself the work of thirteen years,=
=20
worthy of the original-a profound meditation on the text that stands as an=
=20
extended lyric in its own right. His thoughtful conversation with Gervitz=20
follows the poem.



Migraciones should be of interest to all those interested in poetry, Latin=
=20
American literature, and the Jewish experience.



Gloria Gervitz is a lifelong resident of Mexico City, where she was born in=
=20
1943. A recipient of fellowships in poetry from the Fondo Nacional para la=
=20
Cultura y las Artes for 1993 and 1997 to 2002, she has been publishing her=
=20
poetry since 1979, when "Shaharit," the first part of Migraciones, appeared=
=20
as a separate volume. It has been followed by Fragmento de ventana (1986),=
=20
Yiskor (1987), Pythia (1993),

Treno (2003), and Septiembre (2003), and, between 1991 and 2002, a series=20
of editions of Migraciones, each incorporating the new sections. The=20
present volume includes numerous revisions and is the definitive edition.=20
She has published studies of the work of Clarice Lispector and Osip and=20
Nadezhda Mandelstam and translations of poems by Samuel Beckett, Anna=20
Akhmatova, Kenneth Rexroth, Susan Howe, Rita Dove, and, under a grant from=
=20
the Fund for Culture Mexico-USA, Lorine Niedecker. Her own work has been=20
translated into French, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Russian.=
=20
A German edition of Migraciones appeared in 2002.



Mark Schafer was born in Concord, Massachusetts in 1962 and lives in=20
Cambridge. He has published numerous translations of Latin American poetry=
=20
and prose, including Virgilio Pi=F1era, Cold Tales (1988) and Ren=E9's Flesh=
=20
(1989); Eduardo Galeano, The Book of Embraces, with Cedric Belfrage (1990);=
=20
Alberto Ruy S=E1nchez, Mogador (1992); and Jes=FAs Gardea, Stripping Away=
 the=20
Sorrows of This World (1998). He has been the recipient of an NEA=20
Fellowship, a grant from the Fund for Culture Mexico-USA, and the Robert=20
Fitzgerald Translation Prize.



Migrations / Migraciones may be ordered from Junction Press=20
(junction@earthlink.net), Small Press Distribution (spd@igc.apc.org), Latin=
=20
American Book Source (edgardo@latambooks.sdcoxmail.com), and all of the=20
larger book wholesalers.



"To say that this is a book of the immigrant experience-which in some sense=
=20
it is-is to underrate the range of form and feeling that Gervitz brings to=
=20
it, creating thereby an epic of the migratory self. Like Pound's Cantos or=
=20
Zukofsky's A, hers is the work of a lifetime: a life's work including not=20
only autobiography and familial memories as a kind of history but rife with=
=20
religious and mystical imagery from Jewish kabbala to Mexican folk=20
Catholicism and beyond. Migrations takes its place with theirs as a long=20
and difficult poem which is the achievement of a great poetic talent: a=20
complex tribute to the complex world from which it comes."


Jerome Rothenberg



"Migraciones presents the unmistakable, majestic voice of Gloria Gervitz,=20
one of the most powerful and original voices of contemporary Jewish Latin=20
American literature, in all its fullness, and Mark Schafer's translation=20
does it justice. Mystical, at times wrenching, it is a poem of ancestral as=
=20
well as modern voices, a poem that should be read slowly as if reading a=20
prayer.


Marjorie Agos=EDn



Migraciones is an extraordinary and deeply moving poem. Gloria Gervitz=20
looks out all the world's windows and Mark Schafer throws them open to=20
gather in the most soaring and luminous of words. Migraciones is a journey=
=20
to the depths, to the heights, and across the range of our most profound=20
emotions. This is poetry that rains inside us, leading us back to=20
primordial waters.


Elena Poniatowska



The sorrowful voice of Gloria Gervitz resounds within a terrifying=20
vastness. Her words-prayer, oracle, litany-soar and plunge into the abyss,=
=20
tempered by a breath that transcends meaning. They cross to the other side,=
=20
to what precedes them, where submerged words breathe. Born of dark silence,=
=20
her poetry rescues memory; it returns to the origin of its own pale dreams.=
=20
Her poetry enthralls and overwhelms.


Sa=FAl Yurkievich



A dramatic affirmation that wonderful poetry still comes out of Mexico.

Hi Harry,
 I just translated a poem by Douglas Clark that is on the poets' Corner:
http://www.fieralingue.it/corner.php?pa=3Dprintpage&pid=3D1104 and will soo=
n be
there in Italian:
 The Ruined Chapel
 Clark said that the words:
 Hang out your brightest colours
 was what George Bernard Shaw said on hearing of the assassination of
Michael Collins, the Irish revolutionary leader. This was as a mourning
gesture.
Thus:
 Hang out your brightest colors!

Hi All,

I=B9m very interested in Asa Benveniste=B9s poetry and printing at the Trigram
Press in London. In mid-December, I=B9ll be heading out to St. Louis to do
some reading in the archive at Washington University, and wanted to try to
learn as much as I can before leaving. I=B9ve been asking around, and no one
seems to know much about the poet or the press. Any suggestions or
recollections would be welcomed, on or off list.

Cheers,

Kyle

I suspect, know much. Andrew Crozier, maybe.

Probably run a query to see how many poets named their kids "Asa"
and ask why.
I always suspected AB had something to do with it.

As promised, I've been showing restraint on Rock Heals announcements --
as it's a weekly and I don't want to wear out my welcome.

But this week has a-nudder clicky-clicky poem from Justin Sirois (you
may have seen his previous Tickle Torture, which was good good stuff) --
so come check it out and watch him fly in the face of petty petty
copyright laws. Recent weeks have had poetry from Lauren Bender and K.
Lorraine Graham; video from Katherine Gorman; dispatches from L.A. by
Bob Massey; and a  yummilicious recipe from Kevin Thurston.

http://www.rockheals.com

Also: I'm hoping to run a piece on Lisa Jarnot's Iraq Hat Memorial next
week as we've passed the 2,000 casualties milestone... if you have your
own lingering Iraq war response out there (from writing to visual to
whatever) send 'em my way back channel or to submissions at rockheals
dot com.

Sitll more news: Just putting the editorial finishing touches on the
first Rock Heals Print venture: "Hornily Flap," a chapbook of poems from
Vietnamese crazy guys Bui Chat and Ly Doi (tr. by Linh Dinh). Hope to
wrap up the production and start sending them 'round by Black Monday...
The LA Times is already saying, "Hornily Flap will be this year's Tickle
Me Elmo."
A few Bui Chat poems (also tr. by Linh Dinh) showed up on Rock Heals a
while back -- go there to get a sampling of his work -- though Ly Doi's
stuff couldn't be more different.

Sidebrow (http://www.sidebrow.net) â€” an online & print
journal dedicated to innovation & collaboration â€”
seeks fiction, poetry, art, essay, ephemera, found
text, & academia for its inaugural issue, as well as
creative response to current posts and ongoing
projects.

The first month of Sidebrow finds resonance among
pieces by Jason Snyder & Chris Tysh; collaboration
between Brett Evans & Chris Stroffolino; the
inauguration of the Letters Project
(http://www.sidebrow.net/2006/epistolary.html) under the
guise of epistolary fiction from John Cleary & the
poetry of Ed Skoog; as well as dub fiction from
Lawrence Ytzhak Braithwaite & code poetry by Mez Breeze.
Forthcoming will be caged narratives by Greg Mulcahy &
Derek White, as kicked off by Ed Skoog's paean to "The
World-Famous Topeka Zoo."

As an online journal evolving toward print, Sidebrow
provides a forum for exploring the collective & the
singular in the literary arts. By taking an open-ended
approach to its construction, Sidebrow expands on the
traditional literary journal model, showcasing
communally derived literary pieces alongside
individual works.

Sidebrow evaluates submissions both as stand-alone set
pieces & as points of departure for collaboration with
editors & fellow contributors. Writers whose
submissions resonate with other pieces under
evaluation will be contacted to participate in
communal constructions based on their work. To open
the assembly of each issue of Sidebrow, editors will
post pieces periodically in hopes of stirring creative
response. Submissions that re-imagine, depart from, or
explore the interstices between posted pieces are
highly encouraged. As a way of stimulating such
submissions, editors will annotate potential fodder
for response (http://www.sidebrow.net/2006/fodder.html) for
most posted pieces.

Given its desire to unlock what is common to disparate
literary, artistic, & cultural pursuits, Sidebrow
encourages the submission of both partial excerpts and
fully formed works.

Oh ho sing mystic all the day bards!

Here's the deal:

Take a favorite (or despised or cliche) holiday-connected phrase and
do a homolinguistic translation of it.

Send me the original phrase, your homolinguistic translation of that
phrase, and your snail mail address, by email, by December 1st.

I will put each translation onto the "picture" side of a postcard, and
place the original phrase as the "title" on the address side, along
with your name as author.

Then, I'll print up as many sets are there are participants and mail
complete sets to all the participants (postmarked) by December
7th--hopefully that will put them in everyone's hands in enough time
to be useful for your holiday card mailing needs.

How fun does that sound?
Dan

PS: Please feel free to circulate this invitation to any people or
lists you think might be interested. This is an open invitation, but
publication will only be to the closed set of actual participants.

MAD SCIENCE IN IMPERIAL CITY
by Shanxing Wang

(selected for publication by Edwin Torres, Kristin Prevallet, Heather=20
Ramsdell & Dan Machlin)


Thursday, November 3, 2005
7:00 P.M., FREE

Teachers & Writers Collaborative

with readings by Shanxing Wang and Special Guests
& Wine and cheese reception.

Directions: 4,5,6,L,N,R to Union Square, F to 14th Street.

Shanxing Wang=92s Mad Science in Imperial City is a work of genius. It =
is=20
intended to be so, and it is saturated with the melancholy and exhibits=20=

something of the fear that genius in its machinations may produce. The=20=

book is also comic, sometimes desperately and more often happily so;=20
the forces of genius are multiple. Comprised of four interrelated=20
works=97which might also be termed chapters or perhaps sections of a=20
serial poem=97this book escapes characterization; escape, in fact, is =
one=20
of its motifs. But it is an escape carried out paradoxically through=20
invasion=97it finds ways out by finding ways in. The work lays out for=20=

itself multiple trajectories, including some provided by math,=20
mechanics, phantasy, music, film, and above all by dreams (or are they=20=

nightmares?) of life in and out of a plan. Culture shapes itself to=20
grids; or, perhaps, gridding and cultural production are the same=20
thing. Shanxing Wang=92s Mad Science in Imperial City proceeds through=20=

involutions and across equations to create an astonishingly original=20
counter to the catastrophe of the contemporary world. This is a=20
brilliant book.
=97Lyn Hejinian

Mad Science in Imperial City is humbling, beautifully mapped and=20
calibrated, wild with imagination, wit, irony. I think it is one of the=20=

most naturally brilliant books I have read of late. Shanxing Wang=20
brings his engineering genius to his genius for a new magical/radical=20
language. Many bows in my old mandarin robe to this impressive debut=20
collection.
=97Anne Waldman

Mad Science in Imperial City is propelled by the personal loss and=20
trauma Shanxing Wang experienced during the political turbulence of the=20=

1980s which culminated in the 1989 tragedy at Tiananmen Square. =46rom=20=

this personal experience, Wang has created a work of art-in-language=20
which breaks new territories of poetic form. The central urgency of=20
Wang's work is a fractured personal and ideological loss; mirroring=20
this, the work manufactures its own form on the page as a broken=20
narrative. Like Dictee by Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Wang's work=20
materializes the shattered effects of cultural history on the mind of=20
the poet who is trying to piece his life together in its devastating=20
and unresolved wake.
=97Kristin Prevallet


Shanxing Wang was born in Jinzhong, Shanxi Province, China, and studied=20=

Mechanical Engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong University. In 1991, at the=20
age of 26, he moved to the U.S. to pursue a PhD in Mechanical=20
Engineering at University of California at Berkeley. While teaching=20
Engineering at Rutgers University, he began to take courses in Creative=20=

Writing, and subsequently received a Zora Neale Hurston Scholarship to=20=

attend the Summer Writing Program at Naropa University. In 2003, he was=20=

ABOUT ACTIONBOOKS

Rather than setting forth a program for a certain
aesthetic, this press is interested in encouraging
poets to follow their obsessions, dare to enlarge our
notions of what poetry and language can do and be. We
are much more interested in poetry that fails
interestingly than succeeds by skillfully replicating
models.
Among other things, we are interested in poets that
work with the book as the unit of composition (rather
than the individual poem), poets who experiment with
the visual presentation and logic of the text, and
poets whose manuscript reveals its own process, rather
than merely finalized products.

As part of this goal to enlarge the notion of poetry,
we plan to publish contemporary writers in
translation. We want to challenge the artificial
boundaries of national and aesthetic schools.
We want poetry that goes too far.

A small follow up for those who are interested, it turns out that the
rumors are true: Bowery Poetry Club will provide an audio recording of
any performance there for a very reasonable price ($25 as of this
writing). So, yes, barring any unforeseen glitches there will be a
recorded version of this evening made available after the fact.

Yay! Bowery Poetry Club, and Yay! to everyone who clued me in to the
fact that the possibility was there (first was David from Boog City).

THE CONTEMPORARY WRITERS SERIES at Mills College is proud to welcome poet
and translator,
Khaled Mattawa. Khaled will be the first reader in Mills' new Chana Bloch
Reading of Writers in Translation, a yearly reading celebrating the art of
translation.

Khaled Mattawa was born in 1964 in Benghazi, Libya and emigrated to the US
when he was 15. The translator of three volumes of contemporary Arabic
poetry, in 2003 he won the PEN Award for Poetry in Translation for Saadi
Yousef's *Without an Alphabet, Without a Face *(Graywolf Press, 2002).
Marilyn Hacker writes about the book, "These poems are urban and lyrical,
engaged in the signal struggles of our era (including the long one of the
Palestinian people for self-determination), but radiating at the same time =
a
humanist universalism attained through intense attention to the particular.=
"
The first ever Arab-American poet to win a Guggenheim Fellowship, his most
recent collection of poems is *Zodiac of Echoes* (Ausable Press, 2003).
Mattawa currently teaches creative writing at the University of Michigan.

Come see Khaled Mattawa read on Thursday, November 17, 2005.

Refreshments will be available.

CANADIAN BELLADONNA*
with Nathalie Stephens & Rachel Zolf

Tuesday, November 8, 7PM
@ Dixon Place (258 Bowery, 2nd Floor=8BBetween Houston & Prince)
Admission is $5 at the Door.
=20
Nathalie Stephens writes in English and French, and sometimes neither.
Writing l'entre-genre, she is the author of several published works, most
recently L'Injure (l'Hexagone, 2004), Paper City (Coach House, 2003), and J=
e
Nathana=EBl (l'Hexagone, 2003). L'Injure was a finalist for the 2005 Prix
Trillium; Underground (TROIS, 1999) was short listed in 2000 for the Grand
Prix du Salon du livre de Toronto. Stephens's writing appears in various
anthologies, including Shift & Switch: New Canadian Poetry (2005), Biting
the Error: Writers Explore Narrative (Coach House, 2004), Breathing Fire II
(Nightwood, 2004), Portfolio Milieu (Milieu Press, 2004), The Common Sky :
Canadian Writers Against the War (Three Squares, 2003), La Cendre des mots
(l'Harmattan, 2002), side/lines: A New Canadian Poetics (Insomniac Press,
2002), Mondialisation et Identit=E9 (GREF, 2001) and Carnal Nation : Brave Ne=
w
Sex Fictions (Arsenal Pulp, 2000). Stephens has presented her work
internationally, notably in Barcelona, Chicago, Norwich, Ljubljana and New
York. She is the recipient of a 2002 Chalmers Arts Fellowship and a 2003
British Centre for Literary Translation Residential Bursary . Some of
Stephens's work has been translated into Basque, Bulgarian, Slovene and
Spanish. She has translated Catherine Mavrikakis and Fran =E7ois Turcot into
English and R. M. Vaughan into French. On occasion, she translates herself.

Toronto poet Rachel Zolf's practice is situated near the limits of language
and the page. She creates polyvocal assemblages from found fragments, long
poems that work by accretion with montage shock effects. Themes that includ=
e
subjectivity, cultural identity, sexuality and trauma stew in wry
anti-aesthetic language/lyric explorations of the modern familiar. Her
second book, Masque (The Mercury Press, 2004), was nominated for the 2005
Trillium Book Award for Poetry, and the title long poem from her first book=
,
Her absence, this wanderer (BuschekBooks, 1999), was a finalist in the CBC
Literary Competition. She serves as poetry editor for The Walrus magazine.

AudibleWord.Org <http://www.audibleword.org> announces a first podcast:


*1.0 - _Cecilia Vicu_*_ñ
<http://www.audibleword.org/auditoria/vicuna.htm>_*_a_*

She is the author of more than a dozen poetry volumes, including the
recent titles El Templo, Cloud Net, and Instan, available from SPD
Books.Org. Some of her poetry is translated or produced bilingually in
collaboration with translators such as Suzan Jill Levine and Rosa
Alcala. Equally well known within the art world as a performance and
installation artist, she has been featured in the Whitney Biennial and
the Museum of Modern Art,  as well as countless other museums on three
continents.  One thinks of her varied arts as sharing the vision that
there is a virtue in crossing borders, joining the disparate, in
recuperating lost materials and memories.

Projected podcasts will feature John Taggart, Rachel DuPlessis, and the
sound-art of Martin Spinelli.

Audible Word  Podcasts are written and produced by Kenneth Sherwood as a
project of the AudibleWord.   The mp3 soundfile may be directly

When I posted before  about Mehmet Tarhan's situation in Turkey, some of you
from the Poetics List  wrote saying you wanted to hear updates.  Some good
news, just in from the  hard working folks at Pay Day and the Global Womens
Strike.  See their  announcement below....

Tarhan is an  inspiration!
CAConrad
-------------

STOP  PRESS
We have just received news  from Turkey that imprisoned gay conscientious
objector Mehmet Tarhan has  won most of his demands and come off his hunger
strike after 34  days.
Mehmet  Tarhan had been on hunger strike since September 30, following the
forcible and  violent shaving of his hair and beard, to protest against the
unjust and  arbitrary practices of the prison authorities.
His supporters in Turkey,  spearheaded by Istanbul  Anti-Militarist
Initiative (IAMI) _http://www.mehmettarhan.com_ (http://www.mehmettarhan.com) , also
tell us that  the Military Court of Appeal has just  overruled his 4-year
sentence on procedural grounds.  It  is now expected that he will be tried again by
Sivas Military Court on charges  of "insistent insubordination before the
[military] unit, with the intent of  evading military service altogether."
Further  information will follow.

Strange, Beautiful Things
By Susan Jefts

A man I met in December reappeared last week in a jazz club.=A0
Whispered words like incantations.=A0Words about dreams made real
and life as a circular work of art that we keep reentering.
Nowhere does it say to leave our circumstances or stay,
but only to become more alive.

In the forest where I skied with my friend, the sun laid pink
over a family of birches.=A0On the frozen lake surrounded by cliffs
we skied a path to a wall of ice, blue, green and orange.=A0
It left colors on the snow and pulled the sky in close.

Today I saw my friend Francesca.=A0Through the caf=E9 window
she thought she saw Paris.=A0I read a poem about transformation
from one thing to another. Even of hatred or despair into a blackbird=20
in winter.
Nothing is only one thing. There is always something else
hidden or waiting on the edge of its skin about to take flight.

Just heard Spike Lee here on hiphop.  I think the question is whether hiphop
is good, bad or indifferent poetry?

Subject:      New on Sporkworld: Rilke and the Archaic Torso, by Edward Picot
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Sporkworld is happy to announce the publication of the e-criticism work =
Rilke and the Archaic Torso, by Edward Picot. This project launches a =
new "Guest Artists" page on Sporkworld. Submissions for this page are =
open, and may be sent to Millie Niss.=20
Edward Picot's work provides a series of responses to a poem by Rilke. =
We begin with the poem itself along with various translations into =
English, augmented by photographs illustrating the subject of the poem, =
a Classical sculpture of a bust with missing arms and legs. Next, Picot =
gives us a collection of commentaries about the poem. These commentaries =
set the poem in the context of the Modernist movement in poetry, relate =
the poem to older poetry, and give us some insight into the =
philosophical unederpinnings of the poem. Up to this point, the work is =
a well-executed piece of conventional literary criticism. In accordance =
with the somewhat academic tone of the commentaries, the pages are =
formal, spare, and largely free of new media bells and whistles. Picot =
is quite capable of making things interact and move arond, but in these =
pages of commentary, he chooses not to make extensive use of these =
techniques.

If you stare at the Commentary page long enough, you will notice that =
the links to the three sets of comments change their order every so =
often. This is meant to indicate that the three pages are independent =
and are not meant to be read in a specifc order. New media allows for =
non-linear structures, and Picot wants us to realize that when a menu of =
links is presented, it really does indicate a choice. We are not meant =
to move slavishly down the page from top to bottom as we would be =
required to in a print paper.

The fulcrum of Rilke and the Archaic Torso is the Undercommentary, which =
is the plainest page of all. On this page, Picot turns the whole notion =
of literary criticism on its head. In the guise of a commentary on the =
Rilke poem, Picot weaves in numerous references to books he says he =
hasn't read, and tells us that "Instead of sitting here in front of my =
computer screen, trying to make myself seem important, trying to think =
of important-sounding things to say about Rilke, and European cultural =
history for fuck's sake, I should be out there walking." The =
Undercommentary is less about the Rilke poem than about Picot himself, =
and makes us wonder how and why a poem such as Rilke's could be relevant =
to Picot's life, or to ours.

If the Commentary is focused on the poem, and the Undercommentary is =
focused on Picot, the final part of the work, which makes use of more =
digital fireworks than the preceding sections, is a synthesis of the =
two. It consists of a series of poems written by Picot that give us =
several interpretations (perhaps "reworkings" would be a better word) of =
the Rilke poem, using different poetic forms and making use of a varying =
range of tones.

Picot is the curator of the website The Hyperliterature Exchange, which =
features reviews and essays about new media literature, along with a =
catalog of work (by a large variety of authors) which is available for =
sale. Picot's own new media writing is available on his personal site, =
http://www.edwardpicot.com/.

SPECIAL FORUM
THE SECOND WAVE OF "ANTI-TERROR LAWS":  SECURE OR
SECURITY STATE?

Speakers: David Bernie (A/president Council for Civil
Liberties)
& Phillip Boulten (President, Criminal Defence Lawyers
Assoc)

TUESDAY 8 NOVEMBER 2005 at 7.45pm.
Venue: Reginald Murphy Hall,
Greenknowe Ave & Elizabeth Bay Road, Elizabeth Bay
(Ground Floor, under Darlo Theatre)

November Meeting of the Kings Cross ALP Branch
All members and friends welcome

BACKGROUND
This Bill is one of the most significant pieces of
legislation curtailing our civil liberties ever to be
considered by Parliament in peacetime. Once this Bill
is passed it will remain in force for ten years. And
because Australia does not have a Bill of Rights, the
courts will not be able to stop civil rights abuses
under this Bill.

Among other things the proposed new laws will:

    * broaden the definition of a 'terrorist
organisation'
    * create new laws against 'financing terrorism'
    * introduce draconian 'control orders' and
'preventative detention orders' - to detain people
without charge for extraordinary periods of time
    * increase police powers to stop, question &
search people
    * force journalists and others to reveal their
sources to police by making it an offence not to give
up documents that the government wants
    * create new sedition laws that could even make it
illegal to protest against the government's war in
Iraq.

Dear Poetics:



I know you're all dying to get your hands on a copy of my new chapbook,
Plausible Worlds (Observable Books, 2005). The price is $8 for stapled, $12
for the "special edition" of 50 hand-sewn and numbered copies.  If you send
me a check, I'll put an autographed/inscribed copy in the mail right away!!
3734 Hartford Street, St. Louis, MO 63116.



Here's a teaser: http://jacketmagazine.com/28/belz3.html



The design and printing was done by Firecracker Press
(http://www.firecrackerpress.com/firecracker.html), so it's an unusually
beautiful book. I mean, it's one of the prettiest little chaps I've ever
leafed through.



Hope you're all well.



Aaron

Afghan poet dies after battering

A well-known Afghan poet and journalist has died from her injuries
after being beaten, police say.

Officers found the body of Nadia Anjuman, 25, at her home in the
western city of Herat.

A senior police officer said her husband had confessed to hitting her
during a row.

Nadia Anjuman, a student at Herat university, had a first book of
poetry printed this year. She was popular in Afghanistan and
neighbouring Iran.

Police say the poet received a cut to her head. Blood she vomited may
help determine the cause of death, the Pajhwok news agency reported.

It said her family had refused to allow doctors to carry out a post
mortem.

We're pleased to announce the release of Skip Fox's "At That". It's
available now from Ahadada Books and SPD. See below for ordering details.

Feel free to print out and distribute the press release below:
http://www.sendecki.com/ahadada/archives/download/atthatpressrelease.pdf

Fox, Skip
ISBN 0-9732233-6-7
"At That" by Skip Fox.  192 pages, 5.25" x 7.25" USD $16.95/ CDN $12.95

Poetry. Skip Fox, with the concern of an entomologist, presents passages
sprawling and pinned in a shadow box of observations and odd lots. Framed
under double glass, the mounting board of At That writhes with a cast of
freaks: Ezekiel in the streets, a kitty bomb squad, sadists on steroids, the
shadow of Cadmus, kingfishers, omen clad apertures of evening with cicada
wings, heart attacks of clouds rolling in off the Gulf, a city mouse,
spastic proctologists, and so forth, all projecting their "goods" in spate:
smatterings, obsolete creeds, mordacious stumps, "furious opinions,
exaggerations, fabrications," neo-prophetic stylings, verbal molestations,
elegiac mumblings, the silence above a shallow grave, etc.

Currently serving what appears to be a life sentence at the University of
Louisiana at Lafayette, Skip Fox has worked in woods, warehouses, shake and
shingle mills, lumber yards, ketchup & catfood factories, mental hospitals,
and so on.

Nazim Hikmet was not directly killed b/c of his writing, though he was
jailed for 13 year.  Some poems for young folks.  Check out Kenneth
Rexroth's "Thou Shalt Not Kill".  I think it's a good one for HS students,
and has litany of writers who came to tragic endings

Dear Group,

Blue Poets in almost completed. I have circulated the linked verse =

Reminder, I am not looking necessarily for a diatribe, tirade or =

project and I appreciate the participation and collaboration around the =

Featured artists, Pierre Joris and
Nicole Peyrafitte at THE GOLD MINE

***followed by an Open Mic***


P i e r r e  J O R I S
"To read the poetry of Pierre Joris is to listen to the ticking of =20
the words, to observe them preparing to move and alter themselves so =20
as to expose the nature of what a split second of fervor in language =20
can do to meaning." - Nicole Brossard

Poet/Translator/Professor at the University at Albany. Modern & =20
Contemporary Poetry, Poetics, Theory and Practice of Translation. =20
Pierre Joris is the 2005 Pen Award for Poetry in Translation for his =20
translation of Paul Celan's Lightduress (Green Integer, 2004). Also, =20
he has translated into English, along with Jerome Rothenberg, the =20
recently published The Burial of the Count of Orgaz & Other Poems by =20
Pablo Picasso (Exact Change, 2005). A major collection of Pierre =20
Joris' works Poasis: Selected Poems 1986=961999 was published by =20
Wesleyan University Press, 2001. A substantial selection of his =20
essays A Nomad Poetics (Wesleyan University Press, 2003) investigates =20=

the state and aims of contemporary poetry with particular critical =20
attention to avante-garde poetics. Pierre Joris is the author of more =20=

than two dozen volumes of poetry and is co-editor of the anthology =20
Poems for the Millennium: The University of California Book of Modern =20=

and Postmodern Poetry, along with Jerome Rothenberg.

N i c o l e  P E Y R A F I T T E
"Nicole Peyrafitte is a brilliant and original performer. Her =20
vocalizations, songs and gestures are provocative: both beautiful and =20=

powerfully unnerving at times, the chthonic goddess come to tempt =20
you, scare you, transform you. Hers is a poetic lineage of Greek =20
tragedy, Caf=E9 Voltaire antics, of dada and surrealist play but with a =20=

post-modern, hip sensibility." - Anne Waldman

Nicole Peyrafitte is multimedia visual/voice artist. Born & raised in =20=

Luchon, French Pyrenees, she left her hometown, where she was a cook, =20=

in 1981, and lived in Toulouse & Paris where she modeled, cooked and =20
worked for theater and local television. She arrived in the United =20
States in 1987, where she first settled in Southern California, then =20
moved to Albany, New York in 1992, where she still is. Like the =20
willful child in Marguerite Duras' Les Enfants, she resisted going to =20=

school "because they were trying to teach me things I didn't know." =20
Each step of her work attempts to fulfill her compulsion to learn =20
through a process of immersion that generates performances =20
incorporating voice / paintings / drawings / collages / writing & =20
even cooking. Nicole Peyarafitte has performed internationally, in =20
London, Paris and Luxembourg, as well as touring extensively =20
throughout the United States. She was voted Best Performance Artist =20
for the Capital Region 2005.

The "17 Poets!" program is a weekly presentation (which returned to =20
New Orleans Thursday, October 13, 2005) at The Gold Mine and has =20

& writers from all walks and minds throughout our community.
This weekly event also serves as a joining of hands for people in our =20=

community to express through the Arts their deepest loves and =20
affections for the community of New Orleans.

presentation stage and our business is family owned & operated.

Ray,

Lorca was murdered by soldiers of Spain's Popular Front in 1936.

Nigerian writer & activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was murdered by the Nigerian
government in 1995. An anthology entitled "Dance the Guns to Silence: 100
Poems for Ken Saro-Wiwa" has just been published, and an event coinciding
with that publication will happen this Friday -- ten years after his
execution. For more, see http://www.remembersarowiwa.com/press/pr5.htm.

Thanks, Dan, for mentioning Ken Saro-Wiwa, especially as we're
approaching the 10th anniversary of his execution.  Even though you
specifically were asking about poet-martyrs, Ray, I bet the students
would be interested (and disturbed, in all the right ways) to hear the
particulars of what happened to Saro-Wiwa because of his writing.

Best,
Tony

sidebrow: http://www.sidebrow.net


An online & print journal dedicated to innovation & collaboration,
Sidebrow provides a forum for exploring the collective & the singular in
the literary arts. By taking an open-ended approach to its construction,
Sidebrow expands on the traditional literary journal model, showcasing
communally derived literary pieces alongside individual works.

Sidebrow evaluates submissions both as stand-alone set pieces & as
points of departure for collaboration with editors & fellow
contributors. Writers whose submissions resonate with other pieces under
evaluation will be contacted to participate in communal constructions
based on their work. To open the assembly of each issue of Sidebrow ,
editors will post pieces periodically in hopes of stirring creative
response. Submissions that reimagine, depart from, or explore the
interstices between posted pieces are highly encouraged. As a way of
stimulating such submissions, editors will annotate potential fodder for
response for most posted pieces. And, as each issue evolves, editors
will also post calls for submissions based on predefined constraints.
Check back periodically for potential parameters to incorporate in your
work, or send your email address to constraint (at) sidebrow (dot) net
to receive updates.

Sidebrow seeks fiction, poetry, art, essay, ephemera, found text,
academic inquiries into mathematics, economics, & the sciences,
political analysis, and literary, cultural, & art critique. In short,
engaging material regardless of ilk. Given its desire to unlock what is
common to disparate literary, artistic, & cultural pursuits, Sidebrow
encourages the submission of both partial excerpts and fully formed works.

Queries and all other correspondence should be sent to sidebrow (at)
sidebrow (dot) net.

I agree.  I consider any poet who commits suicide to be a murder victim, as
society sets the stage for every creative soul's demise.  We, as a society,
despise and wish to see dead all the artists, poets, and other sensitive and
creative intelligences who live in our time, yet we revere those already
gone.  They're safe.  The won't hold a mirror up to us.  Seeing the flaws
and foibles of an age past is okay.  We don't have to deal with that; it's
done.

Desnos, if memory serves, was one of the unfortunates who died after his=20
camp was liberated--he was simply too far gone to survive.

I haven't been following this thread. Has Max Jacob, who died in Drancy,=20

Reinaldo Arenas certainly doesn't feel out of keeping with the general
thread of martyred writer, though he died later in the US after leaving
Cuba.

Dear Group,

Blue Poets in almost completed. I have circulated the linked verse through
all the Red States and only have Tennessee unrepresented. Anyone from
Tennessee or who knows a Blue Poet in Tennessee who wants to contribute
please contact me. I will be putting up Blue Poets in a Red State in the
next issue of Big Bridge.

Contributors or leads can contact me at walterblue@bigbridge.org

Reminder, I am not looking necessarily for a diatribe, tirade or whatever.
There are all kind of ways of considering these "category". I welcome the
nuances. They are the beauty of it. It has been a great project and I
appreciate the participation and collaboration around the country.

Best, Michael

George,=20
I'm unaware of any poetry George Jackson wrote...I have read "Blood in =
My Eyes,"  I can't call the text poetic.  Though his death makes for =
poignant poetic subject matter...e.g. Dylan's attempt. =20

George Jackson was a young man who got shafted by the California penal =
system...true, he was a petty thief who stole a paltry sum of money from =
a business, and for that petty crime he was sentenced to one of those =
open-ended prison terms.

I've no idea if California still sentences folks that way, and if they =
do, there is a crime of enormous proportions which needs to be =
corrected!=20

Imagine going to prison for a petty crime and being sentenced to 1 to =
"N" years, with the "N" being determined by the guards and the =
warden...what a mistreatment of humanity that is!

While I was at Soledad ( teaching H.S. English, not serving time) from =
August 64 through June 65, I met a great many inmates who were =
incarcerated under those same conditions...open-ended sentences!=20

By the way, much of what appears on the net about George Jackson that =
id's him as the man who brought the Black Panther Party to Soledad =
Prison (...ooops we should use the CA term for the facility: Soledad =
Correctional Facility, not prison) is inaccurate.  One of my former =
students, Eldridge Cleaver, actually deserves credit for that action.  =20

Hi all,

I don't know how many folks on the list are in North Texas, but I
thought I'd let y'all know that the Dutch sound poet & vocalist Jaap
Blonk will be performing at the Fort Worth Museum of Modern Art, at
8:00 pm Saturday November 19, 2005. He'll be performing a set of
historic sound text pieces and compositions (by Georges Aperghis,
Hugo Ball, Kurt Schwitters, Tristan Tzara, and Robert Wilson) as well
as a set of original works.

I hope that some of you can attend, he's a wonderful performer and if
you live in the area, you know that this kind of thing is pretty rare
around here.

Bests,

Herb

I was wondering the same thing.

Were legitimate literary inquires one of his pet fetish items?

Maybe his talents enabled him to rhyme when most males would just pant
heavily.

I'm glad somebody let me in on the doc's dirty little secret.

Hey Pierre, Nicole:

Raise it up down there!

Gerald S.

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 2005, 8:00PM

Featured artists, Pierre Joris and
Nicole Peyrafitte at THE GOLD MINE

***followed by an Open Mic***


P i e r r e  J O R I S
"To read the poetry of Pierre Joris is to listen to the ticking of
the words, to observe them preparing to move and alter themselves so
as to expose the nature of what a split second of fervor in language
can do to meaning." - Nicole Brossard

Poet/Translator/Professor at the University at Albany. Modern &
Contemporary Poetry, Poetics, Theory and Practice of Translation.
Pierre Joris is the 2005 Pen Award for Poetry in Translation for his
translation of Paul Celan's Lightduress (Green Integer, 2004). Also,
he has translated into English, along with Jerome Rothenberg, the
recently published The Burial of the Count of Orgaz & Other Poems by
Pablo Picasso (Exact Change, 2005). A major collection of Pierre
Joris' works Poasis: Selected Poems 1986–1999 was published by
Wesleyan University Press, 2001. A substantial selection of his
essays A Nomad Poetics (Wesleyan University Press, 2003) investigates
the state and aims of contemporary poetry with particular critical
attention to avante-garde poetics. Pierre Joris is the author of more
than two dozen volumes of poetry and is co-editor of the anthology
Poems for the Millennium: The University of California Book of Modern
and Postmodern Poetry, along with Jerome Rothenberg.

N i c o l e  P E Y R A F I T T E
"Nicole Peyrafitte is a brilliant and original performer. Her
vocalizations, songs and gestures are provocative: both beautiful and
powerfully unnerving at times, the chthonic goddess come to tempt
you, scare you, transform you. Hers is a poetic lineage of Greek
tragedy, Café Voltaire antics, of dada and surrealist play but with a
post-modern, hip sensibility." - Anne Waldman

Nicole Peyrafitte is multimedia visual/voice artist. Born & raised in
Luchon, French Pyrenees, she left her hometown, where she was a cook,
in 1981, and lived in Toulouse & Paris where she modeled, cooked and
worked for theater and local television. She arrived in the United
States in 1987, where she first settled in Southern California, then
moved to Albany, New York in 1992, where she still is. Like the
willful child in Marguerite Duras' Les Enfants, she resisted going to
school "because they were trying to teach me things I didn't know."
Each step of her work attempts to fulfill her compulsion to learn
through a process of immersion that generates performances
incorporating voice / paintings / drawings / collages / writing &
even cooking. Nicole Peyarafitte has performed internationally, in
London, Paris and Luxembourg, as well as touring extensively
throughout the United States. She was voted Best Performance Artist
for the Capital Region 2005.

The Korean poet Chon Sangpyong was tortured by the Korean Security Agency,
and when he was released he disappeared, permanently traumatized. An Sonjae
(Brother Anthony of Taize) has produced excellent translations of Chon's
poems; see http://anthony.sogang.ac.kr/.

It is fascinating and disturbing to think about and teach poems by poets who
have suffered because of what they believed and wrote. In reference to Ray
B.'s
original question, what are some good ways of introducing such poets and
works
to young people (those in middle or high school or even younger)?

I agree.  I consider any poet who commits suicide to be a murder victim, as
society sets the stage for every creative soul's demise.  We, as a society,
despise and wish to see dead all the artists, poets, and other sensitive and
creative intelligences who live in our time, yet we revere those already
gone.  They're safe.  The won't hold a mirror up to us.  Seeing the flaws
and foibles of an age past is okay.  We don't have to deal with that; it's
done.

Afghan Poet Dies After Beating by Husband

KABUL,
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/afghanistan/index.html?inline=nyt-geo>Afghanistan,
Nov. 7 - Nadia Anjuman, who had been gaining a name for herself as a poet
in Afghan literary circles, died over the weekend in the western city of
Herat after being beaten by her husband, police officials said Monday.

The death of Ms. Anjuman at age 25 was lamented by colleagues and condemned
by the United Nations as a tragic example of the violence that so many
Afghan women still face despite their advances four years after Taliban rule.

Ms. Anjuman was knocked unconscious by her husband during an argument
Saturday evening, Col. Nisar Ahmad Paikar, chief of the police crime unit
in Herat, said in a telephone interview.

Her husband, Farid Ahmad Majid Mia, is in custody and has admitted hitting
his wife and knocking her unconscious, Colonel Paikar said. Ms. Anjuman
died later in a hospital, he said. "She had a dark bruise under her right
eye," he added.

Ms. Anjuman, a literature undergraduate at Herat University, published her
first volume of poems this year, titled "Gule Dudi," or "Dark Flower." She
was to publish a second volume next year, said Sayed Haqiqi, a local
journalist and colleague of Ms. Anjuman in Herat's Cultural Association.
Her husband, who graduated with a degree in literature from the same
university, worked as an administrator in the literature faculty, Mr.
Haqiqi said.

A spokesman at the United Nations mission in Kabul, Adrian Edwards, called
Ms. Anjuman's death tragic and a great loss to Afghanistan. Her death
"needs to be investigated, and anyone found responsible needs to be dealt
with in proper accordance with law," he said.

"Reverence"
by Sarah Manguso

Love not the rider but the old rider,
the ghost in the saddle: Obey that ghost.
A good horse runs even at the shadow of the whip.
But we are not good horses.
We bolt. We stand still in bad weather.
We rely on things we know are unreliable,
it feels so good just to "rely."
We are relied on.
But I do not know who knows that bad secret.
I do not see who sits astride my back,

by Urmuz
translated by Julian Semilian

Algazy is a pleasant old man, gap toothed and grinny, with sparse and silky
beard, neatly placed upon a gridiron screwed under the chin and hedged with
barbed wire...

Algazy speaks no European language... But if you wait for him in the dawn of
day, at the break of morn, and say to him: “What goez, Algazy!” dwelling on
stressing the sound of Z, Algazy grins, and so as to manifest his gratitude,
pushes his mitt in his pocket and yanks at the start of a string, prompting his
beard to jump for joy an entire quarter of an hour... Unscrewed, the gridiron
serves to resolve any quandary, pertinent to the harmony or hygiene of the home...

Algazy never accepts bribes. Once only he lowered himself to this mode of
demeanor, when he was a copyist for the Church Notary, and even then he took no
cash but only a few crock shards, eager to endow with dowry several of his
indigent sisters who were about to become betrothed the very next day...

Algazy's greatest bliss — along with his customary tasks at the store — is to
harness himself of his own good will to a wheelbarrow, and tagged at the
distance of two meters by his crony Grummer — to hop at a gallop, with the
singular ambition of collecting old rags, punctured vegetable oil tins, but
notably, knucklebones, which then the two gobble together, after midnight, under
the most sinister silence...

Grummer, moreover, sports a beak of scented wood...

This is related to a cultural festival in Lowell that I'm sure would offer some honorarium. One person suggested to me was Miles Champion. I'll answer all queries.

Hello everyone. Please pass this on to every soul in Vancouver or
anyone who might like to come. The show is next Wednesday and we are
all very inwardly excited. Corey.

Do you know the way to Gabriola?

On November 16, en route to the Poetry Gabriola Festival on Gabriola
Island (Nov. 17-20), the travel trajectories of some of the hottest
performance poets from across Canada and abroad will converge at Rime
on Commercial Drive. The line-up includes: from Montreal, Ian Ferrier
and Fortner Anderson; from Brooklyn, NY, Corey Frost; from Friesland,
the Netherlands, Tsjebbe Hettinga; from Gabriola Island, Hilary Peach
and Alex Varty (on table steel and electric guitars); and joining
them from Vancouver, Kedrick James and RC Weslowski. Don't miss this
collision of incredible international talents. A weird hybridity may
spectacularly occur.

Nov. 16th, 9 pm. Come early. $5-10
Rime is at 1130 Commercial Drive, www.rime.ca or
604.215.1130.

Richard Jeffrey Newman will be reading from his translation of Saadi's
Gulistan:

Saturday, November 12
Bowery Poetry Club
308 Bowery (between Bleecker & Houston)

WHY PERSIAN LITERATURE? WHY NOW?
SAADI=92S 13TH CENTURY ROSE GARDEN IN TODAY=92S WORLD
=A0
Saadi of Shiraz, a contemporary of Rumi, is one of the masters of =
classical
Persian literature. His masterpiece, the Gulistan (Rose Garden), is =
revered
worldwide both for the literary pleasure it provides and for the wisdom =
it
contains. In the 1600s, Andre du Ryer=92s translation of the Gulistan =
into
French gave the West one of its first sympathetic windows into the world =
of
Islam. Subsequent translations into Dutch, Latin, German, Russian and
English spread Saadi=92s name and the humanistic values that are so =
central to
his work throughout the literary and cultural landscapes of the 18th and
19th centuries, influencing writers like Goethe, Byron, Emerson and =
Thoreau.
Emerson thought so highly of the Gulistan that he called it =93a secular
bible.=94 In the 20th century, a passage from the Gulistan was inscribed =
in
the lobby of the United Nations. Now, in the 21st century, with Iran
occupying an ever more significant place on the world stage, it is =
important
that we revisit that country=92s history and culture, reminding =
ourselves of
the treasures it has given the world and looking to see what we can =
learn
from those treasures not only about Iran and its people, but also about
ourselves.=20
=A0
Richard Jeffrey Newman is an essayist, poet and translator who has been
publishing his work since 1988, when the essay =93His Sexuality; Her
Reproductive Rights=94 appeared in Changing Men magazine. Since then, =
his
essays and poems have appeared in Salon.com, The American Voice, The
Pedestal, Circumference, Prairie Schooner, ACM, Birmingham Poetry =
Reviewand
other literary journals. He has given talks and led workshops on writing
autobiographically about gender, sex and sexuality. Selections from =
Saadi=92s
Gulistan, his first book, was published in 2004 by Global Scholarly
Publications (GSP). He will be translating four more books for GSP: =
Saadi=92s
other masterpiece, the Bustan, Ferdowsi=92s Shahnameh, Nezami=92s Haft =
Peykar
and Attar=92s Elahi Nameh. His own book of poems, The Silence Of Men, is
forthcoming from CavanKerry Press. You can learn more about his work at
www.richardjnewman.com. He is an Associate Professor in the English
Department at Nassau Community College.

"Samedi soir, au moment de la rupture du jeûne (vers 18h30), les 400 CRS
et gendarmes, dont une partie vient de Chalon s/saone, sont sortis un
peu partout dans la cité du Chêne pointu. Comme à l’accoutumée, il
s’agissait d’encercler - "de boucler" - le quartier. Don quichottisme
policier : en cohorte, à la façon des légions romaines, au pas de
course, visière baissée, bouclier au bras, et flashball à la main, ils
parcourent les rues une à une contre des ennemis invisibles....Pourquoi
cette démonstration de force alors même que les rues étaient
particulièrement calmes ?" -- Antoine Germa -- "Clichy-sous-Bois : zone

and


Clichy-sous-Bois, the impoverished and segregated north-eastern suburb
of Paris where the two men lived and where the violent reaction to their
deaths began, was a ticking bomb for the kind of dramatic social
upheaval we are currently witnessing. ...A simple gesture of regret
could go a long way towards defusing the tensions for now. The morning
after the gassing of the mosque, a young Muslim woman summed up a
widespread feeling: "We just want them to stop lying, to admit they've
done it and to apologise." -- NAIMA BOUTELDJA -- "The Explosion in the
Suburbs: Paris is Burning"

and


The Web document alleges that a massive police operation was
deliberately designed to exacerbate the conflict with the youth on the
estate after initial riots following the deaths of the two teenagers had
subsided...Minister Nicolas Sarkozy is bent on stoking up the revolt of
the youth...After widespread criticism—some it from his own party, the
ruling Union for a Popular Movement—for his provocative description of
the largely immigrant and Muslim youth on these poor, working class
estates as “scum” and “gangrene,” which need to be sandblasted away, he
defended his stance on November 3. --

and


The police have been unable to re-establish order despite strong action.
Hit-and-run youth gangs coordinating action over mobile phones have been
too quick for them. It now seems less and less likely that police action
alone can restore calm....Nicholas Sarkozy's remarks calling violent
youth 'scum' also provoked further violence, several experts say.

military police in racial dictatorships, and of regimes practising
ethnic cleansing," ... -- Julio Godoy -- "Paris Riots Spread Into Rebellion"

burning under the weight of Black rebellion. The American media called
these rebellions riots, but it was Kwame Ture (formerly Stokely
Carmichael) and other progressive leaders who preached to the Black
community that what was happening in the streets of America were not
riots but, in fact, were rebellions. They were an oppressed people
rebelling against an unjust authority."-- A. Akbar Muhammad -- "The veil

yay!  good news here too; the incumbent mayor of St Paul, a Democrat
(or, as they say around here, a "DFL-er" -Democratic Farm and Labor)
who endorsed Pres. Bush lost to a *real* democrat by a landslide, so
now we will have an ex-Green Party DFL mayor in Mpls and a DFL mayor
in St Paul.

I find it worth noting that the Williams lines tend to
end on stressed syllables, whereas yours tend to end
on unstressed syllables.

Out of 27 Williams lines, only 8 end on unstressed
syllables (30%); out of a comparable 31 Silliman
lines, twice as many, ~16~ end on unstressed syllables
(52%).

The difference between the Williams 30%-70% and the
Silliman 52%-48% also seems significant to me.

To do something 70% of the time (use stressed
syllables at the end of a line, like Williams) is to
do something with a convincing burden of
intentionality. So, Williams is ostensibly using
stress-accentual standards as part of his authorial
intent: the lines are, to that extent, "metrical."
There is "proof" that there exists an authentic,
underlying basis for his line-breaks: that they lean
toward stressed endings.

Doing something 52%-48% of the time, though, is so
close to 50-50 that it's only negligeably different
from randomness. The Silliman excerpt is either making
its line-breaks (from a metrical viewpoint) randomly,
or stress-accentual considerations (versus, say,
semantic considerations) were not a standard for him,
again resulting in randomness. The basis for the
line-breaks appears that much more subjective, then,
than the objectivity that can be found for the
Williams line-breaks. (In that sense, the Objectivists
may have indeed been literally objective.)

Wow!

This is fascinating; worthless, but fascinating!  And the conclusions =
from the amassed data are equally interesting...again, worthless, but =
interesting. =20

What's fascinating to me is not the knowledge I now have of the =
differences between the end syllables of the poems of two poets, but the =
knowledge that somebody out there actually spent the time and exerted =
the energies to collect the information. =20

I remember once, as an undergraduate, reading from a Concordance that =
had a count of the number of times various words appeared in the King =
James translation of the Bible...I thought then: "what a waste of time =
and effort...counting such things as the frequency of words in a =
specific text.  And I think now: what a waste of time and energy it is =
to count stressed and unstressed syllables in text, any text!

Now that we have this analysis, I ask myself this, will I appreciate the =
poetry more? =20

And the answer is a simple, "No." =20

Better yet, will the possession of the information help me improve =
either my reading or my writing skills? =20

Again...sorry, Jeffre Jullic, but, "No!"

You say, "...I find it worth noting..." and I ask, "Worth what?"=20

What benefit to either readers or writers is there in knowing what you =
have amassed?  ( And please note I don't question your technical skills =
at assessing the difference between stressed and unstressed syllables, =
though that too is a matter of interest.  Do you have the skill to =
identify a stressed versus an unstressed syllable in text, and do you =
take into account geographic pronunciation peculiarities when you are =
identifying?  What allowances have you made for regional pronunciation =
variables? How have you accounted for the variance between the Williams =
versus the Silliman pronunciation proclivities?). =20

But, again, this data, once compiled, however accurately, ranks right up =
there with all the other worthless information I was forced to learn in =
H.S. by teachers who were mesmerized by useless data drummed into them =
by associate profs who learned the junk while researching their =
dissertations. =20

Should we count the stressed versus unstressed syllables in the =
following in order to appreciate the poet's efforts?
*********************************************************

Transitional                                             =20

First he said:                                            (stressed =
final?)

  I find it worth noting that the Williams lines tend to
  end on stressed syllables, whereas yours tend to end
  on unstressed syllables.

  Out of 27 Williams lines, only 8 end on unstressed
  syllables (30%); out of a comparable 31 Silliman
  lines, twice as many, ~16~ end on unstressed syllables
  (52%).

  The difference between the Williams 30%-70% and the
  Silliman 52%-48% also seems significant to me.

  To do something 70% of the time (use stressed
  syllables at the end of a line, like Williams) is to
  do something with a convincing burden of
  intentionality. So, Williams is ostensibly using
  stress-accentual standards as part of his authorial
  intent: the lines are, to that extent, "metrical."
  There is "proof" that there exists an authentic,
  underlying basis for his line-breaks: that they lean
  toward stressed endings.

  Doing something 52%-48% of the time, though, is so
  close to 50-50 that it's only negligeably different
  from randomness. The Silliman excerpt is either making
  its line-breaks (from a metrical viewpoint) randomly,
  or stress-accentual considerations (versus, say,
  semantic considerations) were not a standard for him,
  again resulting in randomness. The basis for the
  line-breaks appears that much more subjective, then,
  than the objectivity that can be found for the
  Williams line-breaks. (In that sense, the Objectivists
  may have indeed been literally objective.)

I side with John Barth on the issue:

"My feeling about technique in art," he told an interviewer in 1968,
"is that it has about the same value as technique in love-making. That
is to say, on the one hand, heartfelt ineptitude has its appeal and,
on the other hand, so does heartless skill; but what you want is
passionate virtuosity."

(http://www.centerforbookculture.org/context/no5/harris.html)

If this kind of analysis doesn't improve your own technique, so be
it. Others do find value in precisely this sort of look at the nuts
and bolts of craft. Not because they want to construct
poems-by-number, but because it can provide another kind of
understanding of the tools being used and the material being
worked. Exploring the nature and shape of one's own understanding of
these tools and materials is one excellent way to construct a personal
style or find ones voice as a writer.

Does a chef need to know the complete provenance of every ingredient
in the kitchen to prepare an excellent meal? No, of course not. But it
might help to choose this cheese over that one to know that both the
green beans and one of the cheeses--the soft one for crumbling when
the initial thought was to use the more traditional hard one for
grating--come from the same small town. Both choices would have been
equally "good", but a consistent pattern of choices ignorant of
provenance would yield an identifiably different set of meals than a
consistent patter of choices informed by that knowledge. And it makes
no difference to that formation of style if the restaurant patrons
have the knowledge to "get" the connections or not. The style emerges
from the set of choices, not from the underlying reasons.

I'm for anything that helps people develop their individual voices.

I find concordances hugely interesting and useful, as well. It's a
revelatory experience to generate a concordance of your own collected
works, and I recommend it to anyone.

Does information like this, and like Jeffre Jullic provided, help me
improve either my reading or my writing? I say "yes" to both.

Regards,
Dan

A Is for Ancient, Describing an Alphabet Found Near Jerusalem

By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD
Published: November 9, 2005

http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/09/international/middleeast/
09alphabet.htmlb

Archaeologists digging in July at the site, Tel Zayit, found the
inscribed stone in the wall of an ancient building. After an analysis
of the layers of ruins, the discoverers concluded that this was the
earliest known specimen of the Hebrew alphabet and an important
benchmark in the history of writing, they said this week.

If they are right, the stone bears the oldest reliably dated example
of an abecedary - the letters of the alphabet written out in their
traditional sequence. Several scholars who have examined the
inscription tend to support that view.

Experts in ancient writing said the find showed that at this stage
the Hebrew alphabet was still in transition from its Phoenician
roots, but recognizably Hebrew. The Phoenicians lived on the coast
north of Israel, in today's Lebanon, and are considered the
originators of alphabetic writing, several centuries earlier.

The discovery of the stone will be reported in detail next week in
Philadelphia, but was described in interviews with Ron E. Tappy, the
archaeologist at the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary who directed the
dig.

"All successive alphabets in the ancient world, including the Greek
one, derive from this ancestor at Tel Zayit," he said.

The research is supported by an anonymous donor to the seminary,
which has a long history in archaeological field work. The project is
also associated with the American Schools of Oriental Research and
the W. F. Albright Institute for Archaeological Research, in Jerusalem.

Frank Moore Cross Jr., a Harvard expert on early Hebrew inscriptions
who was not involved in the research, said the inscription "is a very
early Hebrew alphabet, maybe the earliest, and the letters I have
studied are what I would expect to find in the 10th century" before
Christ.

P. Kyle McCarter Jr., an authority on ancient Middle Eastern writing
at Johns Hopkins University, was more cautious, describing the
inscription as "a Phoenician type of alphabet that is being adapted."
But he added, "I do believe it is proto-Hebrew, but I can't prove it
for certain."

Lawrence E. Stager, an archaeologist at Harvard engaged in other
excavations in Israel, said the pottery styles at the site "fit
perfectly with the 10th century, which makes this an exceedingly rare
inscription." But he added that more extensive radiocarbon dating
would be needed to establish the site's chronology.

The Tel Zayit stone was uncovered at an eight-acre site in the region
of ancient Judah, south of Jerusalem, and 18 miles inland from
Ashkelon, an ancient Philistine port.

The two lines of incised letters, apparently the 22 symbols of the
Hebrew alphabet, were on one face of the 40-pound stone. A bowl-
shaped hollow was carved in the other side, suggesting that the stone
had been a drinking vessel for cult rituals, Dr. Tappy said. The
stone, he added, may have been embedded in the wall because of a
belief in the alphabet's power to ward off evil.

In a study of the alphabet, Dr. McCarter noted that the Phoenician-
based letters were "beginning to show their own characteristics." The
Phoenician symbol for what is the equivalent of a K is a three-stroke
trident; in the transitional inscription, the right stroke is
elongated, beginning to look like a backward K.

Another baffling peculiarity is that in four cases the letters are
reversed in sequence; an F, for example, comes before an E.

The inscription was found in the context of a substantial network of
buildings at the site, which led Dr. Tappy to propose that Tel Zayit
was probably an important border town established by an expanding
Israelite kingdom based in Jerusalem.

A border town of such size and culture, Dr. Tappy said, suggested a
centralized bureaucracy, political leadership and literacy levels
that seemed to support the biblical image of the unified kingdom of
David and Solomon in the 10th century B.C.

"That puts us right in the middle of the squabble over whether
anything important happened in Israel in that century," Dr. Stager said.
A vocal minority of scholars contend that the Bible's picture of the
10th century B.C. as a golden age in Israelite history is
insupportable. Some archaeological evidence, they say, suggests that
David and Solomon were little more than tribal chieftains and that it
was another century before a true political state emerged.

Dr. Tappy acknowledged that he was inviting controversy by his
interpretation of the Tel Zayit stone and other artifacts as evidence
of a fairly advanced political system 3,000 years ago. Critics who
may accept the date and description of the inscription are expected
to challenge him when he reports on the findings next week in
Philadelphia at meetings of the American Schools of Oriental Research
and the Society of Biblical Literature.

Should one count the syllables in order to enjoy the poem?  Not necessarily.
Could one count the syllables in order to enjoy the poem?  Why not?

Gee, you think maybe GM Hopkins counted syllables?  That it made any
difference where the stresses fell?

Value is contingent; one person's worthless junk may be another person's
treasure.  Attention to prosody is important to a reading of some poems, and
awareness of it is necessary to an understanding of "poetry," at least to an
historical understanding.  Consider Gwendolyn Brooks' comments on how she
reads "We Real Cool."  (An associate prof who learned the junk while
researching her dissertation?)  The tone and implied meaning of the poem
shifts according to whether or not the "we" is stressed.  Brooks unstressed
it-not the way I would have done it when I first read the poem, but maybe I
spent too much time in pool halls.

Williams isn't Hopkins or Brooks, and people might disagree on what should
be stressed or unstressed, but the poem by Williams below demands variable
stresses in the repeated phrase, whether or not that variety is intentional
in anyone's reading of the poem.  I can't see how Williams couldn't have
cared about it and thought about it in the way he created the line breaks.
If Williams cared, and one cares about his poetry, shouldn't one care about
the prosody and consider it caringly?

They taste good to her
They taste good
to her.  They taste
good to her.

Particularly in the middle two lines, the end words seem to require rather
heavy stress.  Others could disagree, but a shift in stress creates a shift,
however slight, in understanding.  If one cares about language enough to
care about poetry, how could that be worthless?

By the way, I don't think this is a matter of preference or regional or
personal pronunciation: Man would be silent. (unstressed final?--YES).  I
suppose I might not care about counting syllables if I couldn't do it--I
don't care much about hitting even a hanging curve.  Yes, I am an associate
prof who counted bunches of things for my dissertation and who makes my
students count things (see GM Hopkins and taste above).  That counting may
be worthless to other people (but to some of the students in my classes,
poetry is worthless--fewer at the end of a semester than at the beginning, I
hope), but I think it is FUN. (stressed final)

One week away...

THE CONTEMPORARY WRITERS SERIES at Mills College is proud to welcome poet
and translator, Khaled Mattawa. Khaled will be the first reader in Mills'
new Chana Bloch Reading of Writers in Translation, an annual reading
celebrating the art of translation.

Khaled Mattawa was born in 1964 in Benghazi, Libya and emigrated to the US
when he was 15. The translator of three volumes of contemporary Arabic
poetry, in 2003 he won the PEN Award for Poetry in Translation for Saadi
Yousef's *Without an Alphabet, Without a Face *(Graywolf Press, 2002).
Marilyn Hacker writes about the book, "These poems are urban and lyrical,
engaged in the signal struggles of our era (including the long one of the
Palestinian people for self-determination), but radiating at the same time =
a
humanist universalism attained through intense attention to the particular.=
"
The first ever Arab-American poet to win a Guggenheim Fellowship, his most
recent collection of poems is *Zodiac of Echoes* (Ausable Press, 2003).
Mattawa currently teaches creative writing at the University of Michigan.

Come hear Khaled Mattawa read on Thursday, November 17, 2005!
5:30-7 pm

Hello Everyone.

I'm giving a talk on the Belgian painter Paul Delvaux
on Tuesday evening, 15 November, at Poets House in New
York.  It's described just below. i think it's $7 to
get in.  Thanks.

White Women, Dark Trains, and Poem After Poem—Paul
Delvaux's Railroad Sense with C. S. Giscombe
November 15th, 7:00 PM
New York

Paul Delvaux’s nudes and skeletons are well known and
much discussed; but trains, rail stations, and
switching yards also figure in his paintings.
Giscombe--poet, essayist, railroad engineer--talks
about Delvaux’s trains and their relation to issues of
race, representation, eros, and public transportation
in poetry.

C. S. Giscombe’s books include Inland, Giscome Road,
and Into and Out of Dislocation.

Hey, Mr Saliby:

No one will punish you for deciding you don't need information.
If it does not help you in your personal experience, that's okay.
Go ahead.
You are free not to know.

The York Theatre Company is happy to announce a series of workshop
performances of a new musical Dust and Dreams: Celebrating Sandburg, winner
of a 2005 Richard Rodgers Development Award, administered by the American
Academy of Arts and Letters. Dust and Dreams, inspired by the poems of Carl
Sandburg, is a new kind of musical =AD it is a mix of poetry, musical revue,
and song cycle. The poems are integrated into the musical, with the cast
performing songs inspired by Sandburg=B9s lyrical yet plainspoken language.
The music runs the gamut from folk to jazz =AD all very American and proudly
melodic. Dust and Dreams is a celebration of the land, the lives, and the
love the prairie continually inspires.
Concept and lyrics by Dave Hudson, music by Paul Libman, and choreography b=
y
Janet Watson, is directed by Victoria Bussert, with music direction by
August Eriksmoen.  The cast includes Mimi Bessette (The Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas), Daniel Bogart (National Tour of Les Miserables, The
Ballad of Little Jo at Steppenwolf), Heath Calvert (Good Vibrations),
Jessica Cope (A Chorus Line at Porthouse Theater), A Christmas Carol at The
Great Lakes Theatre Festival), Tim Ewing, Todd A. Horman (Urinetown), Kelly
Sullivan (Contact, Bells Are Ringing) and Anne Torsiglieri (Parade, Blood
Brothers). =20
Early in his career, Carl Sandburg discovered that more people came to see =
a
poet with a guitar than one who simply read his poetry. A poet of the
people, Sandburg soon developed a formula of poetry-reading followed by
singing folksongs he=B9d learned in his Midwest youth. In 1916, his =B3Chicago
Poems=B2 won the Pulitzer Prize and catapulted him to national recognition.
Two years later in 1918, Sanburg won a second Pulitzer with Cornhuskers =AD a
volume of poems that harkened back to his early years in and around
Galesburg, Illinois.  Nearly ninety years later, Carl Sandburg=B9s language
has found new life in Dust and Dreams.

Oop, I thought that the call was for poets who got offed by govts etc.

Anyway, I used to teach in special security in Montreal
and have done gigs elsewhere, so I know something
about writing behind bars.
And I thoroughly believe that Jackson was aimed at
aND screwed. It was $71, I heard, that he was convicted of stealing.
So I called a book 71 Poems for People.

The Wooden Library in Alnarp

The wooden library, or xylothek (from the Greek words for tree,
xylon, and storing place, theke) consists of 217 volumes describing
213 different species or varieties of trees and shrubs.

A xylothek is generally speaking a collection of simple pieces of
wood specimens placed together in some kind of cupboard. In a refined
form it is in the shape of "books" where you can find details from
the tree inside, everything arranged as a "library". This latter form
flourished in Germany around 1790-1810. Four different manufacturers
existed and three of them offered their products for sale. The Alnarp
collection is an example of that.

The Left's (non)Response to the French Riots


...The events in Clichy-Sous-Bois are not controlled, inspired or
organized by The Left, therefore The Left has little to gain from
them.... We all know that the only thing left-wing politicians care
about is the exact same thing that right-wing politicians care about;
power....Every day acts of insurgency are taking places throughout the
world, and very rarely if ever do these acts have anything to do with
bureaucratic political organizations....While the organizationalists of
the world are sitting in their boring meetings ... everyday rebellions
are happening throughout the world.

The Left's (non)Response to the French Riots

November 7 - So, France is burning. "The People" (in this case "The
People" happen to actually be those that The Left oh so much enjoys
claiming to speak for,) are rising up in an insurgency against racism,
the police, the state, capitalism, etc. and, predictably, the response
from the political left has been mediocre at best.

During the first few nights, the main response of The Left was to ignore
the whole thing. With a few exceptions, much of The Left completely
ignored the events in France. The events in Clichy-Sous-Bois are not
controlled, inspired or organized by The Left, therefore The Left has
little to gain from them. There are no consensus based meetings to
decide what needs to be done, what committees should to be set up, what
demands should be made, and who should become spokespersons. There is no
need for any of these things. Everyone taking part in the riots knows
what they want. Go to any ghetto of the world and ask the people what
they want, and the answers will be the same as those of
Clichy-Sous-Bois. There is no need to beg the government to fix things
(AKA making demands.) Only the most profound moron would not realize
what has led to the rioting. There is no need for statements,
proclamations or letters of solidarity. The best form of solidarity
possible is being shown in Marseille, Saint Etienne, Toulouse and the
300 other towns to which the rioting has spread. There are now reports
that Germany and Belgium are starting to experience this same kind of
unrest.

The rioters have no need of The Left. That is why The Left ignored the
rioters. We all know that the only thing left-wing politicians care
about is the exact same thing that right-wing politicians care about;
power. It is often ignored that the same can be said of leftist
political organizations. While individuals within these organizations
may mean well, the organizations soon take a mind of their own. Like a
corporation, whose only goal is to make profit, the only goal of these
political organizations is to gain power. The claim being that power is
needed to change the world. But all too soon, changing the world becomes
secondary to building power.

As the days went by, and the riots spread, The Left was finally forced
to say something about the riots. The only problem is The Left has no
influence, let alone power over the rioters of France. If anything the
power of The Left is just as much threatened by these riots as the power
of The Right. These riots are showing that the people do not need
bureaucratic political organizations to revolt. It is then no surprise
that the Communist Party is doing it's best to stifle events it cannot
control, just like it did with the events of May 1968. "Lacking a
political analysis (…) some young people are reduced to committing
unacceptable attacks against the peace, the safety and the property of
people who work for a living."* (the left wing of the "CP" – the PRCF.)
Leave it to the Communist Party to claim these riots are an attack on
the working class. While thankfully the anarchist organizations are not
as ridiculous as the CP, they too seem to be more concerned with moving
the rioters into an area of struggle which the anarchist organizations
would be able to at least influence. The CNT-FTE demands "more justice.
In practical terms, this means secure jobs, decent wages, humane
working-hours for the parents, adequate housing, an end to
counter-productive police repression, necessary and adequate social
services, and a truly libratory school system. This is how we suggest
our colleagues and the parents of our students struggle."* France is in
a state of insurgent activity and the CNT-FTE is telling people they
should beg for reforms and bread-crumbs from the government? Begging the
government for reforms is something the CNT-FTE can influence and
control. They can help create committees, have meetings, send
representatives to meet with government officials, and other forms of
bureaucracy that make their political organization a little more
influential and a little more powerful, while boring to death everyone
involved. The anarchist CNT-AIT is yet another example of an
organization looking only to gain power for itself. They can hope for
nothing more than "once the pressure lessens, this rebellion should
organize itself, give itself a structure."* The CNT-AIT no doubt
providing this structure. We can see the inner struggle facing these
organizations. How can they balance out their need for power with their
claims of fighting for "The People"? And what if "The People" do not
need these organizations?

Every day acts of insurgency are taking places throughout the world, and
very rarely if ever do these acts have anything to do with bureaucratic
political organizations. In these actions against capitalism, authority
and oppression people are taking power over their own lives. Burning an
SUV, either as a lone Earth Liberation Front action, or in the middle of
a riot in the French suburbs these insurgents are showing they have as
much need for the political Left as they do the political Right.

While the organizationalists of the world are sitting in their boring
meetings trying to decide how best to enlarge their bureaucracies,
everyday rebellions are happening throughout the world. The insurgency
in France has been going on too long and has spread to an area too large
to be ignored. The question that The Left is now asking itself is how it
can take control of these events away from the rioters and use it to
enlarge itself? The answer is it can't. These acts of insurgence have
nothing to do with the organizational Left. That is why the response of
the Left has been so dismal.

Goddard's movie Lost Weekend keeps coming to mind. The horrendous collision
(bodies, blood et al) some where on a sun filled summer highway in the south
of France. The traffic jam that goes on for miles and miles. The French
families - totally oblivious to the carnage and loss - setting up their
picnics, playing frisbee - joys of the middle class.
In current France it seems the collisions are all over the place ('partout')
Yet, I suspect, if you are not in those ghettos, it's easy to remain
oblivious to the factuality of it - as different from media.
Who's bridging this with language. L'Etranger (Camus) seems a singular title
gone way plural.
Maybe there is a 'voice' on this list living in France who speaks?

Like Detroit in 1966 I suspect what is happening ought be no big surprise to
anyone with half an ear to the ground.

George,
Three things:
Indeed, Jackson was killed by prison guards, and by my assessment, he =
was singled out and deliberately and cold-bloodedly murdered.  But the =
murder was not related to his prior robbery.  George was guilty of =
participating in the revengeful murder of a prison guard.  It was for =
that act of revenge that he was killed by guards who too took the law =
into their own hands and committed murder.=20

Second, my point is that Jackson was not a poet...though indeed he was =
"offed."

He was influential among the black and hispanic populations within the =
California penal system, but his influence came from his philosophy =
recommending the violent over-throw of the white power system, not from =
his poetry. =20

Finally, the crime committed against George Jackson I believe is the =
real cause of the death of this obviously intelligent and vibrant human =
being.  That crime is not the murder committed by vengeful guards; it is =
rather the California Justice System's crime of sentencing him.  Those =
criminals sentenced an 18 year old boy who stole $71.00 god-damned =
dollars...truly petty theft by even the CA law books definition...to a =
prison sentence of "one year to life" at a maximum security facility.  I =
mean, they put this kid in San Quentin for god's sake!  The place was =
filled to capacity with hard-core, veteran criminals, people who killed =
other prisoners for such insignificant reasons as failure to share a =
match with which to light a cigarette. =20

I'll try to find a copy of  "71 Poems for People" =20

  Oop, I thought that the call was for poets who got offed by govts etc.

  Anyway, I used to teach in special security in Montreal
  and have done gigs elsewhere, so I know something
  about writing behind bars.
  And I thoroughly believe that Jackson was aimed at
  aND screwed. It was $71, I heard, that he was convicted of stealing.
  So I called a book 71 Poems for People.

I think that it brings up some real questions about what has happened in
Europe over the past thirty years.
It is fashionable to assert that "everyone is the same" that "we are all
tolerant" when in reality people are very different and especially in
Traditional nations like those in Europe.

I can only extrapolate from my own experience my parents are from a small
town in northern Italy and in that town you have families like mine that
have been there for literally hundreds of years, they speak a distinct
dialect, they have a shared history. Immigrants are not treated badly but
everyone from the Left to the Right does not view them as Italian.

And shared history is the issue

In Europe today those who are new immigrants even those from say 40 years
ago do not share the history of the 'native'
People. This is VERY different from american racism (US, Latin America)
where everyone is in someway an immigrant and we share this tradition
together in the end Nativism in the US or Brazil is stupid but in France and
in Europe there are a set of values that are organic and come from that
culture, for example French Republicanism.

But, it seems that the "natives" in Europe do not accept these immigrants
who are unlike them as equals, and please do not mention the fact that there
are many Greek, Italian and Portuguese immigrants in Germany, France and
Britain, those immigrants are European they share parts of the same history
and they are Christians even secular ones.

The reason that the Left in Europe does not respond is because the Left in
Europe is Conservative. No one on the Left in Europe is willing to question
the value of secularism, Welfarestateism, and traditional food and norms,
these are the values of the mass of the 'native' population in Europe and
accomodating Muslims means changing these things.

Imagine Affirmative action in France? How would that work?

Curious about which are the most respected venues for online and print
poetry publication. Personally, I'm more interested in online venues. Where
do you return regularly? What can't you live without?

I have my own ideas and, of course, there are different schools or what-not,
but, additionally, is there a pre-existing resource for this type of
information?

also I though for some reason this post was going to WOMPO, not POETICS
(sorry) and so the aforementioned are less likely to be experimental & =
I'd
censored my comments

Mark(s) is pretty great
the Chain archive is fab

I find the web del sol endeavors useless

to send to this list and not acknowledge writing.upenn.edu/epc would be =
odd;
also some of the copycats like the New Zealand Poetry Center

HOW2 is indispensable; also the How(ever) archive

November 15 (Tue)
8pm

at The Kitchen
512 West 19th Street
New York, NY 10011
http://www.thekitchen.org

Musician David Grubbs and poet Susan Howe collaborate
on a new performance work based on two of Howe’s poems
titled Thorow and Melville’s Marginalia. Drawing from
the journals and letters of Sir William Johnson and
Henry David Thoreau, Thorow evokes the winter
landscape around Lake George in upstate New York and
the historical violence of our national identity.
Grubbs and Howe engage the lake’s icy surface as well
as the voices that haunt the unseen world beneath.
Melville’s Marginalia explores Herman Melville’s
notations in books he owned and loved. Grubbs brings
together a diverse collection of sound sources,
referencing Ives' Concord Sonata, Howe's splitting of
words, melting snow, and flight patterns overhead.

I think it's very hard to do an anthological publication, off or online,
with any continuing force. I almost always prefer the sites of individuals
to anthological endevours. Partly because work tends to get homogenized in
periodic pubs. This issue we have 4389 poems. Brilliant.

The sort of work that I do predisposes me to online publications, however,
and to ones that attempt some interesting diversity of work but not tens of
examples of it all at once. Something I can get my head around. I think my
favorite periodical publication is http://turbulence.org . They don't
publish 'issues' but as they accept work. Each work they publish is
announced on lists such as Rhizome.org. Turbulence.org is not specifically a
literary site, nor specifically a visual art or audio or video etc site.
It's a net art site. They have been operating since 1996. They regularly
commission net art from Americans and those abroad. They have their own
server(s?) and have a very able network administrator who supplies
artist-programmers with good toys. The site is produced by Helen Thorington
who produced the New American Radio series in the eighties and early
nineties that aired on NPR fairly regularly. Again, the project involved
commissioning independent (audio) artists and New American Radio made a
significant contribution to the art of sound via commissions to artists such
as Gregory Whitehead, Susan Stone, Douglas Kahn, Jacki Apple, Pamela Z, and
many others (see http://somewhere.org). Turbulence.org is like NAR not only
in that it commissions work of independent artists but, also, in its
predisposition toward work that takes the media/um seriously. Different
media/um in this case, of course.

Another online publication I like is http://drunkenboat.com .

some more listed here:
http://www.sleepingfish.net/links.htm

I think most of all of them take short stories or at least short short
stories. I'm mostly interested in "poetic" short stories or prose and art
for Sleepingfish, but not anything that looks like poetry if that makes any
sense, but I won't be reading for the next issue (print) until next january.

Other recent Calamari Press news:

-- if you are in the Detroit area Peter Markus will be reading with Michael
Kellerher at the Zeitgeist Gallery on 11/14/05 at 8 PM. He will be back in
NY on 12/9 to read at a mud/song/art event with poet William Corbett,
musician Langhorne Slim and artist Josh Dorman at the Pierogi Gallery in
Brooklyn. Yesterday Peter was also chosen to participate in the PEN/Faulkner
Writer's in Schools Program in D.C. The Singing Fish was also recently
reviewed in Verse:
http://versemag.blogspot.com/2005/10/new-review-of-peter-markus.html.

-- I will be publishing James Wagner's Trilce soon. In preparation I have
made some images to accompany his poems (there I go contradicting myself):
http://sleepingfish.net/5cense/trilce_visuals.htm

-- I also recently reviewed Kamau Brathwaite's new book on 5cense:
http://sleepingfish.net/5cense/Slow_Horses.htm

-- Post Road 11 (another good place for short stories) will be having their
launch party on 11/16 at the lolita bar in NYC (and in other cities listed
here http://www.postroadmag.com/news.phtml).

-- Did I ever mention to the Bufflist that Norman Lock's, er, I mean George
Belden's Land of the Snow Men is available from Calamari Press?
http://www.calamaripress.com/Land_of_the_Snow_Men.htm

And there are plenty more copies of Sleepingfish 0.75 left, you can check
out online samples at: www.sleepingfish.net. Backchannel me for review
copies, or Verse is also still looking for a reviewer for it.

hey--i've been studying the ghazal form a bit lately and all i seem to find
are agha shahid ali's set of "guidelines"--i'm wondering if a poem can be
classified a ghazal without the refrain/rhyme scheme but with some kind of
basic sufi/drunken ecstacy theme and still be written in couplets (that dont
rhyme).
does anyone sing english ghazals?

i also encountered "rubaiyyat"--i've read the book by omar khayaam but have
been told that this too is a poetic form--with refrain/rhyme scheme etc.,
but i've hardly been able to find adequate info about it

and i noticed that there was someone who invited submission to a surrealist
zine? hmm. this may be a bit ignorant, but what and how do you classify a
piece as surrealist?

Best,
Janaki

"and i noticed that there was someone who invited submission to a  surrealist

i suppose it's easier and perhaps more truthful to call it a 'zine of
surreal poetry, rather than "Surrealist." either way, dimitri and i are not
interested in enforcing any sort of strict guidelines.

from the Starfish Q&A:

Given the contentious history of Surrealism, what will the editorial  policy
look like?
Starfish is not interested in dogmatic struggles; our  working definition of
"Surrealism" is a loose one meant to encompass any work  which uses fantastic
or unnatural imagery, possesses an aura of the dreamlike,  and has genuine
interaction with the subconscious. All submissions will be  considered with an
open mind.

When the ghazal was brought over into English, it was originally brought
over without the highly demanding rhyme scheme. Rather it became a form of
loosely connected couplets, and "loose" is the operative word here, with no
fixed form, neither rhyme nor rhythm. The form as it exists in Persian or
Urdu is as Agha Shahid Ali defined it. The evolution of the form is
interesting as an example of how things change when they move from culture
to culture. It's worth mentioning that both Rumi and Hafez wrote ghazals and
that no popular translation of either of these writers does much to capture
that fact. Indeed, the translators tend to ignore the formal aspects of the
poems, not to mention the formal skills of the writers they are translating.
I don't know much about the ghazal in Urdu, though.

I am not so sure that the ghazal, as it has been imported into English,
requires what you call a "sufi/drunken ecstasy theme." And I would be wary
of characterizing that as a characteristic of the form, since ghazals have
been written that do not have those themes.

Hope this helps--

Hi Janaki,

There was a very long discussion on ghazals on Poetics a few years
ago. It culminated, I think, in a ghazal competition and a ghazal
section in August Highland's Muse Apprentice Guild. There were some
very good contributions to this discussion from, as I remember, Kazim
Ali (it may have been someone else) on the questions you are asking
below.

To find the discussion, you can search the poetics archives:
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?S1=poetics
The discussion was in June/ July of 2003.

And the unwieldy MAG is here:

Dear Factory School poetry audio listeners:

After 5 years of providing poetry audio on the internet, Factory
School has decided to decommission it's poetry audio archive. This is
partly due to a number of factors. For one, we have decided that
large scale efforts such as this are best left to larger insitutional
agencies. Our efforts arose out of the lack of institutional efforts
such as those now underway at PennSound (http://writing.upenn.edu/
pennsound), the digital audio archive founded in early 2005 by
Charles Bernstein and Al Filreis at the University of Pennsylvania.
Other efforts, such as Ken Sherwood's audio project at Indiana
University of Pennsylvania (http://www.audibleword.org), are just
getting started. Our assistance to these endeavors will help
facilitate the availability of poetry audio in a manner more
consistent with the original intent of the Factory School Digital
Audio Library. Since 2003, the archive has largely languished, when
what was needed was help with labor and support underwriting the cost
of storing a gigabyte+ of more than 600 poetry audio files. With the
arrival of PennSound, and other projects on the horizon, the time has
come for us to begin the process of removing audio files from our
servers. That will help us with the other major reason why we feel it
is time to do this. We simply do not have the space to store these
files. It's possible that we'll continue to host links to files
stored at PennSound, and it's possible that some files may remain as
we learn what the needs of our users are.

So... that's why we're asking for your help in identifying imoprtant
files stored at Factory School and in collecting information and
ideas about what we should do given the plan to deaccess the audio
files. We'd like to know what brought you to our pages and what you
use them for. Are you a student, a teacher, a poetry enthusiast?
Perhaps you met a poet recently and wanted to know what they sounded
like... We're hoping to collect narratives as well as commentary on
our project.

Please write to me at kuszai at factoryschool org and give me some
sense of what you think. We've also opened a public bulletin board
for anyone wishing to make public their comments: http://
factoryschool.org/public/.

Further announcements about these matters will be made on the public
bulletin board. The transition will continue until the end of the
year, when the links to poetry audio will no longer work.

Again, please take the time to write and provide us with feedback,
suggestions, and some indication of what has been valuable.

Thanks and best wishes,

Joel Kuszai

Last night, I wrote to a Lebanese friend and asked if ghazals are practiced
in Lebanon. (interesting coincedence that ghazals are one of today's
threads) He answered yes, and also mentioned "zajal." I emailed back anxious

I love ghazals and teach (as best I can) the form to 4th/5th graders. We

OBVIOUSLY.

That may not be accepted everywhere, but over large areas of Europe that is

I'm behind on reading my email, so apologies if this has already been
pointed out...

*Lost Weekend* is a film by Billy Wilder.

Godard's (sic) movie is called *Weekend*.

Both are well worth checking out.

Dear Joel,

I could not get the http link to work from the Bflo poetics page, but briefly,
the audio files of the Cuban poets are irreplaceable that Kristin Dykstra and
her husband took in 2000.  I have been using the Green Integer collection of
Reina Maria Rodriquez' poetry in class, and will use that work again this
coming Winter quarter.  Indeed, to be able to send Spanish speaking students
there is irreplaceable.  It would be nice if those could be transferred to
PennSound.

Thanks,
Deborah Meadows

Laurence your post was a little arrogant-


1) Europe is a conservative society based on shared values like the welfare
state, secularism, the European Union and its aversion to war and a strong
class structure that has been institutionalized in the Education system.

2) Trying to compare the Western Hemisphere experience to Europe is silly
and stupid. Immigrants, forced or voluntary has been coming to the Americas
for 500 years and we are a Mestizo continent, Europe does not have this
history Europe is a continent of nation states that until very recently were
defined by ethnicity. It is true that the Americas are full of racism and
evil and oppression but it is also the only continent where many people have
mixed and formed multi ethnic societies there are no Brazils, Argentinas
Canadas or USAs on other continents except for Australia as an exception.

3) Most Native peoples in the America were not "killed" they died from
catastropic diseases brought by Europeans then when they were weak they were
enslaved.

4) It is intellectually dishonest to refer to Native peoples in the Americas
or Africa as such and not to refer to Europeans groups that have been in
their nations for tens of thousands as something else. The French who are
descended from the Gauls are 'native' to France in the same way that
Mexicans who descended from the Aztecs are native to Mexico.

5) My proof for my "silly" remark the Native people of Europe do not accept
immigrants as equals is very simple, in Germany, until two years ago a
Turkish-German who was born in Germany could not get a German passport
easily, Italian law gives a passport to someone who has one grandparent born
in Italy but not to immigrants who have lived in Italy for years, in France
the unemployment rate for the descendants of immigrants is 50% (Check out
Manchester Guardian for this). The National Assembly in France does not have
ONE person in it who is not of Native Gaulish French origin. Obviously if
immigrants were accepted as equals in European society these things would
not be true? Or are these facts 'silly'?

6) Welfarestateism is a word used in Economics and has been defined by
various writers as " a form of state organization that is organized around
the principal that the government has a responsibility to maintain a
societal minimum standard of living."

Dear Haas (btw Lawrence is his name not Laurence as you wrote)

your number three is very true yet in on part very wrong
the diseases that were brought here were dieliberately used as biological
warfare genocide --thosand ands including in pne grou p every single one
except my great greatgrandmother --they were given blankets for their
enforced treks and trains deportations  from one reservation to another--the
american government official blankets were infested with small pox because
it was known indians would die from it--also alcohol was used deliberatley
as a way to destory indians in that when they drink they  have no
resistances to it the way other peoples have--so to give them dinrk is to
make them sic and weaken them physically and mentally  to kill themkill
tlhem or get them to sign something-which  meant whatever the governement
planned to do there was agreed  to the-another biolgical warfare weapon-then
on top of this you  put people in what is a concrentration camp--reservation
with nothing to eat  but dough (which became fry dough as a staple) to stay
warm in winter nothing--so that they die off there as many as possible die
off-
you say indians weren't  killed--they were slaughtered is the word  for what
was done in some instances --capture them and line them up  kill every man
woman and child-round them up and shoot them all-genoicde wipe them off the
face of the earth so you can come in and destroy their land with settlements
railroads mining --money money -the settlers are a form of wepaon also--to
settle is to make a claim to land you do not have any right to--then to
protect your  settlements you have to kill the people there--iti s a simple
logic-it has been used to this day--
when you say the indians died of diseases that is all used to cover the fact
that diseases were deliberatly introduced in many many  instances once it
was learned that they killed indians--biolgoical murder
to say indians were not killed they died of diseases--many many times those
diseases  were dleibaretly introduced--that is biologocial murder, killing a
person with a disaese you know wil kill them
is a way to say  you have no guilt --you did not kill them--they just died
off naturally--
my fisrt wife is a Mohawk and people would talk of it sometims -to say to a
person --here is blanket to keep warm and you wrap them in the arms of a
horrible slow motion suufferirng unto death--that is a sickness in the being
who does this-
they know what they are doing--they use the disase then afterward you can
say--oh they pot small pox somehwere along the line-- you know how it
ls--they cant take it so  they they just died off-
there is a sickness in the mind of the person who uses sickness to
kill--illness as a weaopn
and then later one can say they just died off--
the great evil of the infected blankets alone is a cover-up--literarlly--to
coverup some one one in one and kill them by doing so --and the cover-up is
the very thing used as a weapon--a deiberate murder is turnedi into the most
natural of things
it is not just a sickness of the body that came but a sickness of mind-
the u s governement used this technique--
a mass murder cover up in blankets to keep people warm--and somehow they
just all got small pox--
my really old relatives used to talk about it a lot--how the governemnt
white people could kil invisibly-
you see saying indians died off because of diseases is true in part yes
milions did de this way-which led to the dsicovery of disasese as weapon-and
also the diseases were used to kill by direct orders-
and people can today say with a clean conscience that it was al disease when
in fact i t was aso genocidal warfare murders-
don't believe that indians just simply died off becuase of dieseases--they
were murdered with deseases too

Was it? I'm sorry. But I thought it was yours that was arrogant. You
proposed to argue from one rather unusual example to a whole continent. That
is dodgy at least, you know. I used to do that with the USA and Ive almost
got over it. I urge the same on you

Before you can say this to any effect, you need to express some guidance on
what you mean by conservative if it is to be a useful statement. Only this
morning, for instance, a radio journalist described USA as an intensely
conservative country. Now I am happy with that. I have no idea how you take
it. But clearly the word is being used to mean something else. Just saying
it is pointless

"Europe is a conservative society based on shared values  like the welfare
state,"

perhaps you've been reading some EU documents

We don't all have anything like a welfare state and it's under attack

"secularism,"

excuse me?

apart from it being untrue, you are also falling into the journalist's /
politician's trap of speaking about countries as individuals. A country
can't share a value/ Nor can a continent. People can. And you'll find that
not all do

but re secularism, have a look at Poland

"the European Union"

we're not all in it, and the politicians are averse to letting us vote on
the issue. so it has hardly true to say all share the EU as a value

"and its aversion to war"

Now that would be something. I wish

 and a strong
> class structure that has been institutionalized in the Education system.

again, it depends where you go - class structure means so many different
things, as well - for instance there are some US citizens who think USA
isn't a class-based society

> 2) Trying to compare the Western Hemisphere experience to Europe is silly
> and stupid.

I didn't. I don't think so/ I don't know what it means actually. How do you
compare an experience to a territory? In what sense is the Western
Hemisphere something other than
Europe? Do you mean the west of the hemisphere?

Europe is a continent of nation states that until very recently were

No

Wrong

There is, of course, a difference between the Americas and Europe, but you
are being wildly simplistic

 It is true that the Americas are full of racism and

I live in a multi-ethnic society. And we have lots of mixed-race - culture
relationships

It's been a multi-ethnic society for some time. OK, OK, yours is bigger than
mine

oh, right

Intellectually dishonest?

Again, I am having difficulty understanding you. Are you just saying there
are only tens of thousands of Europeans ? (wrong) or that they have been in
the
same place for tens of thousands of years? (wrong)

I used the term "native people" as a term I found, as it were; I mean the
indigines from the point of view of the marauding Europeans - and earlier in
your reply you clearly understood what I meant

 The French who are
> descended from the Gauls are 'native' to France in the same way that
> Mexicans who descended from the Aztecs are native to Mexico.

The French are descended from the Gauls? Thank you for telling me that. The
archaeologists will be interested

>Obviously if

Well, as you limit my choice, I have to say that they're silly Hans. You're
not comparing like with like. All countries have immigration rules. They're
not all good. But what the govt does is not necessarily what the people want

 6) Welfarestateism is a word used in Economics and has been defined by

> societal minimum standard of living."

I apologise - I engaged in rhetoric.

I am aware of the word with that usage. I don't think it means much. That's
what I should have said. It's an abusive term to a considerable extent - as
if for instance I referred to _American simplisticism_... or Bushism

Europe, like the USA. is too big to make these simple generalisations, which
are only possible to believe in without much information

My apologies for disturbing you just because you said silly things about
where I live. I was in a really bad mood or I would have let it pass. I'm
not really in the mood for this sort of stuff. Treat me questions as
rhetorical, not requiring an answer

all best

Haas: David Baptiste-Chirot is too kind to your abysmal - one can probably
easily say  - provincial ignorance. Genocidal information re Native American
Indians - in addition to the blankets - is easily available, as in mass
slaughter. In my ancestral neck of the woods, read the early history of
Humboldt County, California. Not a trace left or speak left from several
tribes - slaughtered.

If you have reasons not to explore and acknowledge this history, I cannot

enough already.

I understand you are relatively new to this country, all I can suggest is a

not to mention a few other folks, African slaves, among them.

Sorry to be so hard on you, Haas. But your views are a little late in the

Sometimes, especially these years, Blake's vision of  "progression" seems

The human race is genocidal... It is the reason we are so successful as a
species we are expert murderers.  This genocidal lifestyle continues just
read the Wall Street Journal it is there for you in black and white.

What happened in the Americas was beyond words unspeakably evil but this is
a pattern that is thousands of years old and happens again and again.

I am not provincial, I in fact I lived and worked in Bolivia for four years
in a prison with Quechua people who were victims of US policy in the "war"
on drugs and I am very aware of the realities for native peoples in the
Americas but
where should we begin or end our lament should we be selective?

What happened in Americas is no more or less evil than what happened when
the Mongols invaded Russia. Or the Japanese invaded China. Or the Bantus
invaded South Africa. Or when the Incas displaced the Aymaras? Or Tamurlane
destroyed Baghdad,  Or the Slavs invaded Eastern Europe. Or the Aryans
invaded India. Or a million other invasions and genocides. It was the Arabs
who began the African slave trade in the Middle Ages should we go there for
recompense?

People have been slaughtering each other for 50,000 years or more this is a
fundamental part of the human condition we can work as hard as possible to
make the future better but that is all we can do we cannot recify the past
without creating more pain and more suffering. By the way I live in Chicago
and you live in Humboldt, California and we live on stolen land and we are
benefiting from Genocide; but every piece of land on Earth is stolen and
every nation has caused genocide....  Every gold wedding band has the blood
of the miners of Potosi or Minas Gerais in it...

Power is agnostic and amoral.

Nations eliminate who they have to.

Individuals ascribe moral content to what was never a moral question (to power.)

Consider it a convenience, and grow up about the world, and history, and power.

You have no moral nature, and no more value, than the bayonet does.

Ask Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, etc., etc., etc..

It may be fatuous even to respond to this, but in any case:

> You have no moral nature, and no more value, than the bayonet does.

Interestingly, though, a bayonet cannot ascribe a moral value -- to itself, or
anything else. And therein lies all the difference.

"Genocide is the human condition." I might just as pompusly (and ludicrously)
declare that "swimming the backstroke is the human condition." Just because I
say something is so does not necessarily make it so -- but it might. In many
ways that last sentence sums up my interest in poetics.

"Genocide is the human condition" has many problems, some may grasp.

Ascribing morals to humans has even more.

All life, including human, is strictly amoral.

The transaction of power is the only transaction.

All else is self-delusion or mass-delusion.

He began working in schools as a poet-in-residence in 1990 and in the 15 ye=
ars since, he has worked in dozens of schools in numerous states around the=
 country.  Michael began FootHills Publishing in 1986 for the purpose of ge=
tting into print the words of poets who found it hard to get their work out=
 to the public other than at readings or in the occasional magazine. The fi=
rst few books were published in conjunction with Great Elm Press, operated =
by Walt Franklin. Since then, FootHills Publishing has released more than 1=
50 chapbooks or books, including the work of Peter Conners, Christine Gelin=
eau, Craig Czury and Jayne Relaford-Brown. Over the past few years FootHill=
s has added the Springfed Chapbook Series for the promotion of new poets an=
d several anthologies. Michael describes the press as "a labor of love" in =
which his entire family takes part.

Craig Czury is the author of 15 collections of poetry, including,  In My Si=
lence To Justify, FootHills Publishing, and editor of two anthologies, Fine=
 Line That Screams from his N.E. Pa. Prison Poetry Project, and UN SEGUNDO =
EN EL TIEMPO/ONE SECOND At A Time, poets of the Reading Hispanic community.=
 Czury now works as a poet in schools, homeless shelters, prisons, mental h=
ospitals and community centers throughout the world. His books have been tr=
anslated into Spanish, Russian, Lithuanian, Portuguese and Italian, and he =
has been awarded many national and international fellowships to continue hi=
s collaborative poem fusion performance and poetry mural projects, includin=
g a residency at The Playhouse in Derry, Northern Ireland, and the 1999 Ame=
riCorps WritersCorps in Washington, D.C.  Czury lives in Reading, Pa. and h=
as been a featured poet at the International Poetry Festivals in Argentina,=
 Ireland, Colombia, Lithuania,Macedonia, Croatia and Romania.  A revised an=
d expanded edition of his book, God's Shiny Glass Eye, poems from the coal =
region with photos by Czury is available from FootHills Publishing.

Many chapters ahead for bookstore
Last Updated: Nov. 12, 2005

The amazing thing about the small, scruffy and scrappy bookstore and
gallery that we know as Woodland Pattern Book Center in Riverwest is
not that it's there, but that it's there - still.

It looks like it won't be closing shop anytime soon, either.

The bookstore has endured for 25 years, and like the postal service,
it refuses to let either rain or snow or giant bookstores or rank
capitalism or the Internet or a consolidating publishing industry
keep it from its mission.

"For twenty-five years Woodland Pattern has celebrated the
contemporary imagination and, thanks to your support, will continue
to do so . . . " it vowed quietly in small print in its November
newsletter.

And last week, as it prepared for its 25th anniversary celebrations,
its director Anne Kingsbury - she's been running the place at least
as long - sat in an armchair among the wobbly book stacks and
promised again that Woodland Pattern would continue "celebrating the
imagination," and that's how it would survive, would hope to survive.

Karl Gartung and Anne Kingsbury met when she was a teacher and he was
her student. They moved to Milwaukee and in 1980 opened the decidedly
out of the mainstream Woodland Pattern Book Center.
25th Anniversary Events
Nov. 18: Writers Lisa Jarnot, Terri Kapsalis, Peggy Hong, filmmaker
Jennifer Montgomery; readings and a screening
Nov. 19: Writers Keith Waldrop, Rosmarie Waldrop, Roberto Harrison,
Kiki Anderson; readings
Nov. 20: Wanda Coleman, Martha Bergland; readings
Nov. 20: Emcee Hal Rammel

"We've always wanted not necessarily to be the biggest, just the
best," she said. "I think what makes us a little different from other
literary centers is that we've presented different art forms where it
intersects with text or literature.

"As new things (such as the Internet) open up, we want to be open and
free to investigate that. But I guess literature and the world where
it crosses into other things - that's what we want to celebrate. We
want to get past the idea that people are creative only in one thing
. . . The poet Derek Walcott, for instance, is also a very
accomplished painter."

So, the center, which stocks around 27,000 books for sale, has also
curated art shows, hosted jazz musicians, held poetry slams, taught
neighborhood children how to tell stories, given lessons in making
books, invited major writers to read, invited obscure writers to
read, and even reserved a section of its shelves for Wisconsin
writers who have self-published their work.

The center's anniversary celebrations will be no different. They
begin Friday evening with readings and a film, and continue through
the weekend with writing workshops, readings by poets and fiction
writers and a concert of new music in Milwaukee that Woodland Pattern
is slyly billing as "25th Anniversary Waltz (without the waltz)."

In the center's gallery is "The Bright Glade," a visual and text
exhibit by the poet Thomas A. Clark and his wife, Laurie.

Here, last week, Kingsbury paused at the threshold of the gallery as
"The Bright Glade" lay in various stages of completion. Painted on
one whitewashed wall was the phrase "a domed vest of bracken, leaf
debris and moss." There were other phrases on other walls - to be
read / seen with the visuals. In the center of the room a young woman
sat on a rolled-up carpet and directed a group of giggling and
shouting grade school students in performing stories.

"This is what I'm talking about," Kingsbury said.
Kept his day job

While many smaller bookstores across the country have fallen victim
to competition from mega chains such as Barnes & Noble, Woodland
Pattern has survived - or "managed" as Kingsbury says - for three
reasons.

First, it has never strayed from its niche; it remains a powerhouse
of poetry and small presses. Second, as a long-time non-profit center
that actively takes its programs to the community, it has been
fortunate enough to find some support from arts boards and private
foundations each year. And third, because Kingsbury and her husband,
Karl Gartung, both passionate book and art lovers, doggedly refuse to
let the tiny store they turned into a non-profit book center founder.

"Well, Karl has always kept his job driving trucks," Kingsbury said.
"So that has been an underground subsidy. He had to get a day job for
insurance, benefits. And you know, Karl and I own this building - we
bought it in 1980 and we fixed it - and if Woodland Pattern cannot
pay rent sometimes, well -. " She shrugged, then smiling, added,
"Well, no one is going to foreclose on them."

Kingsbury is an idealistic, enduring woman, her tenacity softened by
a smile and a pair of nearly waist-length braids hanging below
precisely trimmed bangs.

She prods and persuades, hunts for funding sources, draws up charts
and projections in her daily battles to stay afloat. And she often
credits her husband, a poet and volunteer coordinator of the center's
literary programs, with setting the tone and vision of the center
early on.

The pair met in the mid-1960s when Kingsbury was teaching visual arts
at a college in Nebraska and Gartung, about three years younger, was
a student in her class. Gartung, she has remembered, cut a lot of
classes so she had to have "a little talk" with him. After that, he
did well enough on the final to make up for his earlier trespasses,
so she gave him a "C."

That was supposed to be the end of it, but after he graduated they
began dating. They married in 1970 and moved to Milwaukee a few years
later when she got a job at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
Passion for poetry

Gartung always had a passion for poetry, and it soon became important
for him to find the works of good, new poets who may not have been
well-known.

When the opportunity came to manage a small bookstore - about 100
books - that three Milwaukee poetry lovers had started in the lobby
of Theater X, he took the job.

That's how he discovered Lorine Niedecker, the Wisconsin poet whose
centenary Woodland Pattern celebrated in 2003 with a conference that
attracted participants from several countries, including the United
Kingdom and Japan.

When Kingsbury was denied tenure at UWM, Gartung went to work as a
truck driver and Kingsbury took over his job at the bookstore.

Soon, the original three founders of the small store moved on to
other ventures; Kingsbury stayed.

By 1980, the couple had moved the store to 720 E. Locust St., its
present address, and achieved non-profit status. They began calling
the new entity Woodland Pattern, after the fictional Midwest cultural
center in Paul Metcalf's epic poem "Apalache."

"We started with less than a thousand books," Kingsbury said. "One
thing that really helped us was that Truck Distribution, which
distributed small press literature, let us take books on consignment.
For quite a few years we were able to build our inventory with that.
It allowed us to build with books we hadn't heard about.

"We've always felt that the small presses are where exciting work is
published. We felt there was a need for a place where these books
could be found. We believed what we had to offer was extremely
important for people. A lot of it is education. It needs to be here.

"I've always felt that people need to be able to choose. So we say
here are some things that you should try out - and you may find a
contemporary classic."
National in scope

Kingsbury and Gartung tried out their multimedia approach their first
year as the new Woodland Pattern center.

That year, 1980, Paul Metcalf gave the store's first poetry reading,
Tom Palazzolo was the first visiting filmmaker, Laurie Anderson was
the first performance artist, and Milwaukeean Jill Sebastian was the
first exhibiting visual artist.

Since then, the center has brought in a host of artists and writers,
among them such exiles as Chinese poet Bei Dao, and in 1995 it
organized its first poetry marathon with 90 Milwaukee writers
participating.

Its work has been noticed; the center is now considered one of the
foremost stores for poetry, especially new poetry, in the nation.

"The reputation of Woodland Pattern is itself national in scope, and
I know of no other center - anywhere in the U.S. - that has carried
on a more intricate and demanding program in the literary arts,"
wrote writer Jerome Rothenberg in 1989.

That reputation, Kingsbury hopes, will help the center secure funds
to keep its four full-time and two part-time employees and continue
its programs.

The revenue from the store might pay for one of those positions,
Kingsbury said.

"It's been touch-and-go many times, many times," she added. "But
we're very appreciative - because when one thing ends we find
something else opens up."

And so, Kingsbury remains calm - and sustained.

===============================================

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

The Words Beats & Life Global Journal of Hip-Hop Culture is currently
requesting the submission of content for Volume 2 Issue 2-4.
www.wblinc.org

Process of Submitting
All submissions are accepted on a continuous basis and need not be
limited to the themes outlined below. Please send all submissions to:
submissions@wblinc.org

Schedule of Topics and Due Dates:

July Volume 2 issue 2
WB&L Journal

1. Topic: One Day it Will All Make Sense:  The Roots of a Culture
Call for submission: 9/31/05  Submission due: 11/25/05
Early b-boys like the rest of the hip-hop community found themselves
looking for inspiration in multiple forms and mediums.  In many ways
the early b-boys reflected and resisted these cultural phenomena in
creating the dance form later called break dancing.  Volume 2 issue 2
is
focused on understanding all of the early influences of upon hip-hop.
The b-boy is not an anomaly in hip-hop, but rather a physical
representation of the rebellious and eclectic nature of the culture.

October Volume 2 issue 3
WB&L Journal

2. Topic: Spinning the Wheels of Steel: DJ's Fading and Mixing
Planets into Harmony
Call for submission: 11/26/05  Submission due: 2/6/06
In contemporary hip-hop culture, the DJ in some instances is as
prominent as the MC.  From the mix tapes, to the battles, it is the DJ
who decides what gets heard.  It is the DJ who creates one continuous
vibe that guides the listeners into becoming active participants in
the
culture of hip-hop.  The DJ makes the party hot, or the mix tape
popular, and is the true director of the hip-hop orchestra.  This has
been the case from the very beginning of hip-hop's emergence in the
late 70s. Submissions for Volume 2 issue 3 should reflect the history,
relevance and innovations of the DJ over the past 40 years.  The
submissions need not be confined to the hip-hop DJ but can include DJ
from throughout the Diaspora.  The DJs can also represent different
musical traditions along with technical papers about the affect of
innovations in equipment upon the ability of a DJ to move a crowd.

Please Join The Mercury Press as we celebrate the publication of:

FROGMENTS FROM THE FRAG POOL: haiku after basho
by Gary Barwin and derek beaulieu

Gary Barwin and derek beaulieu's seamless collaboration has resulted in
frogments from the frag pool: haiku after basho. This collection of poetry
mixes joy with rigour, playfulness with contemplation, and the absurd with
pure poetic passion. Barwin and beaulieu have created poetry that is wise,
witty, and wry. Filled with translations, responses, remixes, and new
takes on Matsuo Basho's famous frog haiku, frogments from the frag pool
exuberantly ripples genre, expectation, and meaning.

about FROGMENTS FROM THE FRAG POOL:
(see http://themercurypress.ca/poetry/frogments.html)

"Delightful surprises lurk within these pages as Gary Barwin and derek
beaulieu examine the old pond, the frog, the splash, and the mind of
Basho. From the microcosmic "old pond / universes rise & fall / a single
splash" to the anthropomorphic "pond holding / its breath..." to the
subjective "mind ponding" to the conceptual "splash as a hole in
silence"--it's all here. This book is a grand addition to the
reverberation of Basho's splash."--Nelson Ball

"Who says you can't teach an old frog new tricks, new licks? Here b and B
take on B, with echoes of bp, in a way that honours Basho and that does
yes "teach the mind again to leap." Their jubilant transribbitations don't
inhibit, they inhabit--visual, bounding, unbound, unwound. Does the frog
jump into water, or into the sound of water? Both of course, and when the
ripples touch us, the joy and anticipation is catching: our hearts jump
too."--Erin Mouré

REVISITING THE BLACK ARTS MOVEMENT
Department of English
Howard University

March 23-24, 2006


The twentieth-century saw the rise of two African American literary
movements-the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and the Black Arts Movement of
the 1960s and 1970s.  Of these movements, the Harlem Renaissance has
received the greater amount of scholarly attention by far, but things are
beginning to change.  The past ten years have seen the publication of books
by Julius Thompson, Cheryl Clarke, and James Edward Smethurst detailing
important aspects of the history of the Black Arts Movement.  Kimberly
Bentson has offered a theoretical exploration of the drama of this period.
Joanne Gabbin's historic Furious Flower conference and the collection of
poetry that followed have done much to rekindle interest in the movement.
Coffee House Press has started a Black Arts series dedicated to publishing
the fiction of the Movement.  And critical texts by Kalamu Ya Salaam and
Mike Sell are forthcoming as well as an edited collection of essays
revisiting the movement by Lisa Gail Collins and Margo Natalie Crawford.

Leading the way in this resurgence of scholarly interest, the Department of
English at Howard University is convening a 2-day conference on the Black
Arts Movement.  The conference will be held from March 23-24, 2006.

I find myself submitting to a lot of online journals at the moment.  I'm seduced by the fact that they tend to respond quickly and that the work, if accepted, appears soon.  This is in contradistinction to many print journals which often take a year to respond and even longer to publish.  I like the idea of participating in a relatively new medium for poetry, also.  As for who reads these online magazines, I've been told by a poet friend that more people read these than the print journals we've been publishing in for decades.  But, so far, I read the ones I submit to and the ones I get published in, as was the case and still is with print magazines so I still don't really know.  I've been in several or rather quite a few of these online magazines, at least one or two supposedly prestigious, so at the moment I'm content to concentrate mostly on online publications.  I'm sure this will change.  Some of them are both online and print.  Is this the best of both possible worlds?

Did anybody mention Shampoo, Big Bridge, Masthead, Fascicles? I find them
all variously ambitious and wonderful.
As to audience - I understand an "audio skull  implant chip" is being
developed that will go "bing" every time your name and a work of yours is
being read, and no matter where on the globe! The chip comes with a visor
that illuminates the name of the publication and poem (or whatever). You can
then either use your cell phone - voice or email - to dialog with the reader
when the reader says he wants to hear from you.
And, excitedly enough, I hear a team of MBAs are working on a business model
to figure out ways in which the author and publisher can get paid! This will
be much to the pleasure of of online publishers and authors - particularly
since nobody, at this point, is getting paid. By the way, the conversations
with the author will also be paid for by the reader. $1 a minute.

Bing. Bing. Skull-on!

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present
Brandon Brown & Brent Cunningham
Friday, November 18, 2005 at 7:30 p.m.

Brandon Brown read brilliantly at the War & Peace party last spring and we are
very pleased to have him back for a full reading now. Brown is the author of
the unpublished books Aphorisms Ghosts, Gnomic Utterances, Metaxia, Four
Pre-Socratic Philosophers, The Bridge Book, Pool, The Laws, My Life As A
Lover, Kidnapped, 1616, and Odes, in addition to unpublished translations of
Catullus, Horace, Diogenes Laertius, and Euripides' Hippolytus.  His work has
appeared in Mirage / Period(ical), Small Town, Bombay Gin, Shampoo, and
Crumpets.  He co-curates Performance Writing at New Langton Arts.

Brent Cunningham joins us in celebration of his debut collection, Bird &
Forest, out this year from Ugly Duckling Presse in Brooklyn. Peter Gizzi
writes"the repeated 'awakenings' of Bird & Forest suggest the wonder of
conversion narrative without the ideological baggage. Engaging myriad
rhetorical 'types,' he exhausts their function to disclose the backstory of
creation, romantic love, and the curious permanence of warfare while
gorgeously demonstrating the resilience of the imagination." Since 1999
Cunningham has worked for Small Press Distribution in Berkeley.


Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to current SPT
members and CCA faculty, staff, and students.
Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in
Timken Lecture Hall
California College of the Arts
1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the intersection of 16th &

In case you had been made to feel that Alito was coming into the Supreme
Court arena as open minded - or were made to feel 'liberally hopeful", here=
,
so it appears, is the flesh made word. I suspect its quick time to put full

Alito rejected abortion as a right
By Bill Sammon
THE WASHINGTON TIMES
November 14, 2005 =20
Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr., President Bush's Supreme Court nominee, wrote
that "the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion" in a 1985
document obtained by The Washington Times.
=A0=A0=A0=A0"I personally believe very strongly" in this legal position, Mr. Alito
wrote on his application to become deputy assistant to Attorney General
Edwin I. Meese III.
=A0=A0=A0=A0The document, which is likely to inflame liberals who oppose Judge
Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court, is among many that the White House
will release today from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.
=A0=A0=A0=A0In direct, unambiguous language, the young career lawyer who served as
assistant to Solicitor General Rex E. Lee, demonstrated his conservative
bona fides as he sought to become a political appointee in the Reagan
administration.=20
=A0=A0=A0=A0"I am and always have been a conservative," he wrote in an attachment t=
o
the noncareer appointment form that he sent to the Presidential Personnel
Office. "I am a lifelong registered Republican."
=A0=A0=A0=A0But his statements against abortion and affirmative action might cause
him headaches from Democrats and liberals as he prepares for confirmation
hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, scheduled for January.
=A0=A0=A0=A0"It has been an honor and source of personal satisfaction for me to
serve in the office of the Solicitor General during President Reagan's
administration and to help to advance legal positions in which I personally
believe very strongly," he wrote.
=A0=A0=A0=A0"I am particularly proud of my contributions in recent cases in which
the government has argued in the Supreme Court that racial and ethnic quota=
s
should not be allowed and that the Constitution does not protect a right to
an abortion."=20
=A0=A0=A0=A0A leading Republican involved in the nomination process insisted that
this does not prove Judge Alito, if confirmed to the Supreme Court, will
overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that made
abortion a constitutional right.
=A0=A0=A0=A0"No, it proves no such thing," said the Republican, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. "In fact, if you look at some of the quotes of his
former law clerks, they don't believe that he'll overturn Roe v. Wade."
=A0=A0=A0=A0Judge Alito sided with abortion proponents in three of four rulings
during his 15 years as a judge on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Philadelphia, usually based on existing law and technical legal issues
rather than the right to abortion itself.
=A0=A0=A0=A0"The issue is not Judge Alito's political views during the Reagan
administration 20 years ago," the Republican official said. "It's his 15
years of jurisprudence, which can be evaluated in hundreds of opinions. And
in none of those opinions is it evident what his political philosophy is.

    The British poet Andrew Duncan was born, in 1956, and brought up in the Midlands, in an atmosphere of technological optimism and class leveling which the South (UK) succeeded in reversing thereafter. He worked as a laborer (in England and Germany) after leaving school, subsequently as a project planner with a telecomms manufacturer (1978-87), and as a programmer for the Stock Exchange (1988-91). He spent much of the nineties with no money at all, simply talking a lot. A shift from (academic) linguist to computer engineer exposed a deep attachment to complex virtual arrays.

there was an interesting article in the NY Times  about how the French concept of all being "citoyen" actually impedes  their acknowledging ethnic difference and the resulting class conflicts  it helps create.  one immigrant from Algeria came to France as a  citizen, because Algeria was a colony.  Once it was free, he and  his family lost their citizenship, because they didn't realize they  would have to apply for it.  but the thrust of the article is that  since ethnic difference is not tracked, the French only know by  anecdote what it is like to be of African or Carribean descent, but yet  still French.

If one wants to make a comparison, on should compare "immigrant" labor in

sources of cheap labor; officially, neither wants to give them the legitimacy of
full citizenship (basically by calling them names). In retrospect, maybe the
Mexicans have done better, many of them through amnesty, etc, becoming citizens
in the next generation. Of course, that doesn't quite mean equality.

One of our poets for The Burning Chair Series will be
giving a multi-media project on Friday night in
Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn.  His plans for the
borrowing of a projector fell through, so now we are
scrabmling? If anyone out that has a projector that

Hello Poetics Listers:

I realize that this is one of the conversations that is recycled
every so often, but I'm wondering if anyone has any inspiration for a
basic literature anthology for an introduction to literature class. I
know all the mainstream ones, from Norton, on down the feed line, but
I wonder if there are any that I'm missing, especially ones by
smaller, indy presses, or especially presses that take into account
certain factors, such as the cost of the book, students as people as
potential readers, etc.. I'm partly looking for something that will
be of use immediately, as well as scouting for a potential book to
develop for future courses, published through Factory School or some
other like-minded publisher. Factors used to consider such a book
serving as an "introduction to literature" anthology would not make
any swipe at being comprehensive but instead be organized around
other principles, including but not limited to:

1. I'll sacrifice eliot, pound, etc., and all the other expensive
authors for ones that don't cost a lot. These authors drive up the
cost of books, so a good intro to lit anthology need not introduce
young readers to books that graduate students have to account for.
Keeping the big "guns" of the canon out of it might help keep costs
down.

2. Community-based, perhaps organized around themes of "work" or
social or ethnic identity, etc. (and I have only my several
personalities to guide me on possible organizational principles, this
list is only suggestive of the kind of approach I'm working with.
Since this approach might allow for a purpose-oriented introduction
to literature and not one rooted in myths of coverage, it's possible
that students might actually enjoy reading the texts in such a
course, not feel that they're being told "what it is" --

I'm going to take a look at the SPD website, since it would be ideal
if this book would be available through SPD and not the corporate
distribution network.

Any thoughts?  Anyone interested in such a question and want to meet
somewhere (online) to talk about this? Please let me know

Thanks...

accidentally sending exactly the right thing you're looking for, sending
something exactly like something you've already published, or writing a
cover letter that really sucks up?

Natural Bridge no. 16: Writing Responding to Women Writers Alongside its
usual miscellany of fiction, essays, poetry, and translations, the 16th
issue of Natural Bridge invites submissions for a Special Section of =
writing
that reflects the presence, influence, or tradition of women writers
(stories, poems, personal essays/memoirs). The more women writers appear =
in
the work of other writers, the longer they will endure. These writers =
may
appear explicitly in submissions, in epigraphs, as characters, etc. They =
may
appear implicitly, in formal, verbal, stylistic echoes: a hint in a =
cover
letter identifying the writer will be appreciated. Respectful salutes,
contentious engagements, and parodies and caricatures (gentle ones, =
please!)
are all welcome. Examples would include Alice Walker interrupting a =
story to
interview Ida B. Wells, Carolyn Kizer caricaturing Sara Teasdale for =
another
generation to wonder about, and Lucia Perillo quoting Vassar Miller in =
her
2005 Luck Is Luck. All forms and schools of writing welcome. Guest =
editor,
Nanora Sweet. Submission period for this issue is November 1--December =
31,
2005.

well, aside from your and a few initial responses, Catherine, the discussion
has not grown much... bragging 1200 subscribers worldwide and then some, and
well-matched target audience, i would have expected more...

my relative obscurity could have something to do with the lack of
responses... it is also possible that my questions were perceived as
uninformed... one might even assume that no one (or, at least, not very
many) reads any of the rags, online or otherwise, that are going around in
those circles...

regarding your message below... i've often looked at a publication,
particularly in my younger days, thought, perhaps zealously, my work a fit,
and then followed the instructions for making someone aware of it, receiving
similar remarks about my lack of research in response... personally, I don't
have the income to purchase every magazine to which i'm interested in
submitting... is it enough to leaf through at it in a bookstore or to simply
respond based on reputation? aside from that, i live abroad, have moved
around often, and find it tedious to deal with such things as subscriptions
at this time... i can accept my failures to meet expectation...

i do rely on the computer for this information and almost all of my
publications in the past four years have been solely electronic... if a
publication doesn't have even a small sample of work online, it's relatively
useless to me... if the publications doesn't take e-mail submissions, it's
simply behind the times and the old boys can keep chugging it... the
opportunity for me to read something online only increases the possibility
that i will actually purchase something when i have the chance...

and you ask a good question, Catherine... if the editor is unfamiliar with
me, and hasn't solicited me *sigh*, is my work automatically round-file
material? do they google for something? possibly, but unlikely...

and, finally, though nigh impossible one might argue, i try to write in a
way that DOES NOT sound like something that has been written before... so
then what?

Woodland Pattern Book Center was my home away from home for 12 miserable
Milwaukee years.  I called it "church" and it truly was the place to
see the greats and the near-greats.  Helen Adam came through there as
well as Robert Duncan, Ric Caddel, Jean-Paul Curtay, and the list goes
on and on and on.  If Karl ever decides to sell that archive of his,
including the tapes of the Woodland Pattern readings and performances,
he and Anne will have a cushy retirement fund and whatever university
comes up with the cash will have its own ready-made center for the study
of 20th and 21st century poetry, fiction, alternative music,
performance, and visual art. Good to see them and the operation
flourishing!  Jess

New York Times has a short obit as well -- Deloria wasn't a poet, but
anybody who wrote CUSTER DIED FOR YOUR SINS deserves a spot in poet's row.

Synopsis:
Inside of room 603 in an unnamed hotel, a man dwells inside a parallel univ=
erse
where he attempts to avoid his quickly approaching destruction caused by th=
e murder
of his wife.  This fractured crime of love weaves George Bataille's =22Mada=
me Edwarda=22
with Barry Gifford's =22Tricks=22.  Both stories spiral around a woman who =
has been
created by the dangerously obsessive desires of their male companion.  The =
opposing
forces of man and  woman play out inside the landscape of deception, while =
all the
characters attempt to hide within the confines of fantasy.  =22Tricks=22 wi=
nds around it's
story with an evocative sparse dialogue and claustrophobic mood that places=
 it in the
tradition of film noir.  =22Tricks=22 contains within it a porthole transpo=
rting the performance
into a vaudeville presentation of =22Madame Edwarda=22, where on her ropes =
and swing
the female character continually transforms herself inside The Mirrors, a s=
eedy brothel
where the male character hopes to find evidence of God in the grotesque.  T=
he stories,

My favorite of his books is Red Earth White Lies. He was an amazing
intellect, writer, and person. I had the pleasure to meet him once at a
wedding and he was very kind and funny as well. Encouraging of a younger
writer, and charming as hell. What a brilliant family he's from too -- Ella
Cara Deloria wrote the great underappreciated American novel, Waterlily.

New York Times has a short obit as well -- Deloria wasn't a poet, but
anybody who wrote CUSTER DIED FOR YOUR SINS deserves a spot in poet's row.

             Third Queens International Poetry Festival To
       Be Held At LaGuardia Community College December 10
     Festival Will Feature 14 poets and Music from World Acclaimed Musicians

  For immediate release

  Long Island City, New York
  November 15, 2005 The Third Queens International Poetry Festival, organized by the New York-based arts non-profit organization Movement One: Creative Coalition, will be held Saturday December 10 beginning at 7pm at LaGuardia Community College’s Little Theatre in Long Island City, New York.The program is free and open to the public.

  The festival will include readings from poets such as American Book Award Winner Daniela Gioseffi, Mario Susko, the Croatian-American author of 23 books, who was a witness and survivor of the Bosnian War, and Harlym 125, who has won many competitions as a spoken word artist. As well, there will be readings from 11 other poets, many of whom write in a language other than English (translations will be provided).

  The program will also feature live music from Gambian griot/kora player Papa Susso and Afro-Cuban Bata drumming with David Gomez and Friends.

  The program is funded in part by a grant from The New York State Council on The Arts’ Decentralization Program as administered by The Queens Community Arts Fund and by Poets and Writers Inc.

  The festival is seen as a celebration of both poetry and New York's diversity. Past participants include Huang Xiang, a writer who was imprisoned in his native China twelve years because of his advocacy of human freedom and self-expression. Huang Xiang is currently a resident in The North American Cities of Asylum Program in Pittsburgh, Pa.

  For its first two years, the festival was held in the auditorium of The Flushing Library, America’s busiest library. This is the first year it will be held on a college campus.

  LaGuardia Community College's Little Theatre is on Van Dam Street between 47th Avenue and Queens Blvd. By public transportation, take the 7 train to 33 Street Rawson and walk two blocks to Van Dam. Buses: Q60, Q32, Q39.

I just thought that Fence was, you know, on the  fence about Poetics.  It does have a certain time marking quality  about it--every so often Fence subscribes and unsubscribes to the list.  There is something performative about it.

  I trust that those who know about the electronic gremlins can make the  appropriate sacrifices to them so that mail from Fence stops bouncing.

WHY PERSIAN LITERATURE? WHY NOW?
SAADI'S 13TH CENTURY ROSE GARDEN IN TODAY'S WORLD

Saadi of Shiraz, a contemporary of Rumi, is one of the masters of classical
Persian literature. His masterpiece, the Gulistan (Rose Garden), is revered
worldwide both for the literary pleasure it provides and for the wisdom it
contains. In the 1600s, Andre du Ryer's translation of the Gulistan into
French gave the West one of its first sympathetic windows into the world of
Islam. Subsequent translations into Dutch, Latin, German, Russian and
English spread Saadi's name and the humanistic values that are so central to
his work throughout the literary and cultural landscapes of the 18th and
19th centuries, influencing writers like Goethe, Byron, Emerson and Thoreau.
Emerson thought so highly of the Gulistan that he called it "a secular
bible." In the 20th century, a passage from the Gulistan was inscribed in
the lobby of the United Nations. Now, in the 21st century, with Iran
occupying an ever more significant place on the world stage, it is important
that we revisit that country's history and culture, reminding ourselves of
the treasures it has given the world and looking to see what we can learn
from those treasures not only about Iran and its people, but also about
ourselves.

Richard Jeffrey Newman is an essayist, poet and translator who has been
publishing his work since 1988, when the essay "His Sexuality; Her
Reproductive Rights" appeared in Changing Men magazine. Since then, his
essays and poems have appeared in Salon.com, The American Voice, The
Pedestal, Circumference, Prairie Schooner, ACM, Birmingham Poetry Reviewand
other literary journals. He has given talks and led workshops on writing
autobiographically about gender, sex and sexuality. Selections from Saadi's
Gulistan, his first book, was published in 2004 by Global Scholarly
Publications (GSP). He will be translating four more books for GSP: Saadi's
other masterpiece, the Bustan, Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, Nezami's Haft Peykar
and Attar's Elahi Nameh. His own book of poems, The Silence Of Men, is
forthcoming from CavanKerry Press. You can learn more about his work at
www.richardjnewman.com. He is an Associate Professor in the English
Department at Nassau Community College.

Face-out on the shelf in the bookstore this morning was
ORPHEUS EMERGED by Jack Kerouac.  Discovered by
the Kerouac estate not long ago, it has been in print for a
couple of years, but was released last month in paper
by ibooks incorporated, complete with an amazing
R. Crumb drawing of Kerouac on the cover.

Below the drawing it says,
"INTRODUCTION BY ROBERT CREELY"

Creeley's name has been part of my generation's lives
on bookshelves across the globe for as long as we've been
pouring over poetry sections whatever city we find ourselves
in, and the missing "e" made me think it was someone else
named Robert Creely. It was instantly odd, wrong, so it must
be someone else.

Then on the back of the book is THIS!
"'There will never be a moment like this one,' says poet and
fellow Beat writer Robert Creeley, in his introduction to this
literary event:  the first full-length work to be published  since
Kerouac's death in 1969."

How much fucking pot must an editor at ibooks incorporated
smoke to make such an idiotic mistake!?  This is really a
disgrace this misspelling of Creeley's name!

At first I was angry when I realized it WAS Creeley, and not
Creely, then I was amused, then I was angry, then amused,
but now I'm stuck on angry again.  What a bunch of stupid
fucking people they must have working over there!  I'm sending
hate mail today!  Good way to start off the morning!

For the memory of CREELEY,
CAConrad

Khaled Mattawa reads tomorrow, 11/17.


THE CONTEMPORARY WRITERS SERIES at Mills College is proud to welcome poet
and translator, Khaled Mattawa. Khaled will be the first reader in Mills'
new Chana Bloch Reading of Writers in Translation, an annual reading
celebrating the art of translation.


Khaled Mattawa was born in 1964 in Benghazi, Libya and emigrated to the US
when he was 15. The translator of three volumes of contemporary Arabic
poetry, in 2003 he won the PEN Award for Poetry in Translation for Saadi
Yousef's *Without an Alphabet, Without a Face *(Graywolf Press, 2002).
Marilyn Hacker writes about the book, "These poems are urban and lyrical,
engaged in the signal struggles of our era (including the long one of the
Palestinian people for self-determination), but radiating at the same time =
a
humanist universalism attained through intense attention to the particular.=
"
The first ever Arab-American poet to win a Guggenheim Fellowship, his most
recent collection of poems is *Zodiac of Echoes* (Ausable Press, 2003).
Mattawa currently teaches creative writing at the University of Michigan.


Come hear Khaled Mattawa read on Thursday, November 17, 2005!

On Valentine's Day "Loving Repeating: A Musical of Gertrude Stein" begins
its run at the Museum of Contemporary Art here in Chicago (see
http://www.mcachicago.org/mca/performance/pe-upcoming-txt2.html). I'm
wondering if people on this listserv have been to any good readings of works
by or about Stein, or seen "Four Saints in Three Acts," or know about any
good upcoming events like this.

 You begin to sense the byshadows that stretch from the awe of global
 dominance. How the intersecting systems help pull us apart, leaving
 us vague, drained, docile, soft in our inner discourse, willing to be
 shaped, to be overwhelmed -- easy retreats, half beliefs. Works of art
 are complex formal interventions within discursive traditions and their
 myriad filiations. These interventions are defined precisely by their
 incomparable capacity to trace the dynamics of historical process in
 paradoxical gestures of simultaneously prognostic and mnemonic
 temporalities.

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from { brad
brace }. The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the
recognizable; it suspends identity, relations and history. This
discourse, far from determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding
the ground on which it could find support. It is trying to operate a
decentering that leaves no privilege to any center.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------

  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

        A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual
impact; an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present
of the Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone...

~ This interminable, relentless (online) sequence of imagery began in
earnest on December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been
over twenty-five years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs has been presently orchestrated for many years` worth of
12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour image
is like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation.

~ The sites listed above also contain information on other cultural
projects and sources.

~ A very low-volume, moderated mailing list for announcements and
occasional commentary related to this project has been established at

This project has not received government art-subsidies. Some
opportunities still exist for financially assisting the publication of
editions of large (33x46") prints; perhaps (Iris giclees) inkjet duotones
or extended-black quadtones. Other supporters receive rare copies of the
first three web-offset printed ISBN-Books. Contributions and requests for
12hr-email-subscriptions, can also be made at
http://bbrace.laughingsquid.net/buy-into.html, or by mailed cheque/check:
$5/mo $50/yr. Art-institutions must pay for any images retained longer
than 12 hours.

Well, it's about publishing kick ass books of poetry that
blow the top off people's heads one perfect-binding at a
time.  It's a series only in the sense that the books
come out one book at a time.  We've published two thus
far.

In April we'll publish the first full-length collection by
American poetry's unorthodox daughter, Katie
Degentesh.  The book is THE ANGER SCALE.  Not
surprisingly, it kicks ass. Look for more about it on the
website soon.

We are not acepting unsolicited book manuscripts at
this time.

Yrs,

Mike

Praise for The December Project

Time stopped in December when I read this fine book of postcard poems.
Written from short bright days and long cold nights, filled with Sean Cole=B9=
s
signature humor, these deeply felt and completely original poems address
those of us who also consider December a project. The poems move from the
mundane to the serious, from love to war to simple pop songs, all in a voic=
e
that captured me at once and wouldn=B9t let go.
=8BWyn Cooper, author of Postcards from the Interior.

Read this book in the middle of the night. Pure clear words as real as any
novel. Read this book in the middle of the day, by sunlight or in rain. Sen=
d
the words to everyone. Everyone needs these words. Who would have thought
that poetry could open so gently into the world? Who would have thought the
brilliant, tender cadences of Sean Cole=B9s Itty City would slow into this
cold radiant narrative of awareness? Still brilliant, still tender; slower
now, and even deeper.
=8BJoseph Lease, author of Broken World, forthcoming on Coffee House Press

t
collections of poetry, By the Author (Boog Literature, 1999) and Itty City
(Pressed Wafer, 2004). He is also the author of this bio.

Aaron Seven Kiely is a model prisoner of love. He was born in autumn 1970, =
a
few days after the summer after the summer after the Summer of Love. His
book, "The Best of My Love," was released this year on Ugly Duckling Presse=

Conrad,

Have you written to the publisher? I suspect the =B3right=B2 thing to do is pul=
l
the book from the shelves and send it back to the bindery to have a fresh
cover put on. Granted, this often destroys the gutter. Of course, that is a=
n
expensive burden for any publisher, large or small.  The book certainly
shouldn=B9t be banned, and an errata slip would be a joke. I haven=B9t seen it,
but if it is a conventional paperback, perhaps they could print a dust
jacket (corrected), but otherwise similar to the botched cover to have thei=
r
distributors and retailers slip on the copies that haven=B9t left the shelves
yet?=20

     Very often later on in both the book and record/cd etc collecting
worlds--items with a misprint may become collectors' items.
I'd by me a copy or two in case--
     In the hardbound edition, Creeley's name is consistently spelled
correctly.
        Bob C would probably get a laugh out of it--and also being
considered a Beat writer rather than the  usual  Black Mountain.

I have two copies of the original ibooks paperback of 2000,
and Creeley's name is spelled correctly on the cover.
Now, how dumb is it?

Hello all --

After a long, long hiatus -- and a move for me from New Jersey to
Chicago -- rhubarb is susan is back online and putting out new reviews.
This week, just one, a review of a poem by Laura Sims from her
forthcoming book _Practice, Restraint_.

Please swing by, share your thoughts here or there, and join the
conversation.

Yours,

Simon

  ah but in Seattle, we no longer mix recycling, so you would be put in  your own box, specially designed, for recycling poets.  that said,  i think when the boxes are picked up, they are taken to Magnolia park  and dumped into the Sound--not even in a current that takes everything  to the San Juans.

     Carl Thayler, a poet and friend of ours, was found dead of natural causes Sunday November 6th in his small apartment a few blocks off Park Street in Madison, WI.
     He was 72 and leaves family in California, several books of sometimes polyvocal, sometimes lyrical poetry and an unfulfilled desire to buy a candy-apple red Harley.
     His poetry was published in several books and small press journals.  He taught poetry, survived poverty and poetry critics, race car driving, an acting career in which he was touted as the "next James Dean" (a friend of his), dates with movie and television star, Loretta Young, heart bypass surgery and a liver transplant.
     Of Carl's poetry, Marcia Wolf, his former wife, said: "He wrote 12 hours a day, short stories, essays, poetry, he wrote the way other people breath.  Among a certain set of poets, he was well-known and respected."


A selection of Carl's poems and reviews of some of his books appear on the literary magazine web-site: jacketmagazine.com.


Howard McCord, who was a very close friend of Carl's, was the one who alerted police that something might be wrong on Sunday when Carl didn't answer his phone after he had been trying to call him for a couple of days.  Howard said most of the poetry Carl really wanted out was published in SHAKE HANDS (Pavement Saw Press, 2001) and in the two volumes of NALTSUS BICHIDIN (Skanky Possum Press,1999,and 2004)  Volume 2 runs 331 pages. His novel, WEST, is being published in 2006 by Ron Horning's press.

Madison poet, erstwhile B-actor Carl Thayler dies
00:00 am 11/16/05
GEORGE HESSELBERG ghesselberg@madison.com

http://www.madison.com/wsj/home/local/index.php?ntid=61018&ntpid=3


Carl Thayler, a Madison poet, died Sunday. He was 72.
One of Madison's most successful unknown poets, Carl Thayler, was
found dead of natural causes Sunday in his small apartment a few
blocks off Park Street.

He was 72 and leaves family in California, several books of sometimes
contrarian, sometimes lyrical poetry and an unfulfilled desire to buy
a candy- apple red Harley.
His poetry was published in several books and small press journals,
including the "Skanky Possum Press." He taught poetry, survived
poverty and poetry critics, race car driving, an acting career in
which he was touted as the "next James Dean" (a friend of his), dates
with movie and television star Loretta Young, heart bypass surgery
and a liver transplant.
In the 1950s in his native California, Thayler was a movie actor,
rugged, curly haired, handsome, but destined for smaller, supporting
roles in B- movies. He played Robert Ford, the coward who shot Jesse
James in the B-movie classic, "The True Story of Jesse James." He
also appeared in "The Abductors," "The Man from Del Rio," "High
School Confidential," and others.
"He was very gentle, passionate about his beliefs," said Deborah Katz
Hunt of Oregon, a former sister-in-law of Thayler.
Thayler, an admirer of country-western music and iconic poet Ezra
Pound, moved to Madison in 1968 with his then-wife, Marcia, to attend
graduate school in philosophy. Their daughter, Emily, was born in
Madison. In 1969, he also had his first book of poetry published, a
limited edition "The Drivers" by Perishable Press in Mount Horeb.
"He didn't finish his Ph.D. because he just wanted to write poetry,"
said Katz Hunt.

Carl was, in the late 1970's when I was in Madison and knew him, one of the
few lights providing openings to younger poets there. He informed us not
only by his work but by his intensity, and the intensity of his commitment.
Rob Fitterman and I, among others, took sessions with Carl, and sometimes
he came to classes I began to offer. He almost seemed so intense, at times,
that it hurt. Yet he also had a warm heart and a gentle sense of humor
about language, and about people. Very sad to hear he is now gone.

Kimberly Bird has done a very nice, and intriguing interview with Carl R
that has just been published - online - at Bancroft's Regional Oral History
Office. I was going to pull a quote, but PDF's do not like that, or here it
seems.
Anyway, from youth to almost death, it's here - shamelessly honest and
direct, whether it's talking about Zukofsky, or Z's son, or the relationship
between the O's and the LP's.

Compliments to K Bird for doing her homework and making this possible.

Scoot around and enjoy. & Let's ROHO can keep interviewing folks on this
level.

fish their gills
water the medium

I remember that after, what, more than thirty years.

dear all,

One of the grand elders of the human tribe has died.

VINE DELORIA JR., RENOWNED AUTHOR AND
AMERICAN INDIAN LEADER, DIES AT 72

Vine Deloria, Jr., University of Colorado, Boulder professor emeritus Vine
Deloria, Jr., author of "Custer Died for Your Sins" leader, died Sunday,
aged 72.

"Vine Deloria was the most important American Indian intellectual,
writer, speaker and man of action," said historian Patricia Nelson Limerick.
"If they gave a Nobel Prize for advocacy of indigenous people's rights, he
would get it first."

Deloria earned a law degree at CU-Boulder in 1970 and taught at CU- Boulder
from 1990 until 2000 in history, ethnic studies, religious studies,
political science and the law.

A provocative and original scholar, he was deeply involved in the campaign
to reclaim native rights.  He wrote more than 20 books, including "God is
Red," "We Talk, You Listen," "American Indian Policy in the Twentieth
Century" and "Singing for a Spirit."

Born into a distinguished Yankton Sioux family, Deloria served in
the Marines and then graduated from Iowa State University and earned a
master's degree in theology from the Lutheran School of Theology in
Chicago and a law degree from CU-Boulder.  In 1964 he became executive
director of the National Congress of American Indians, the largest
intertribal organization, where built coalitions, fought confiscatory laws
and outright theft, and proposed genuine reforms.

He taught at the University of Arizona from 1978 to 1990 before joining the
CU faculty.

Memorial arrangements are pending.  Contributions, in lieu of
flowers, are suggested to the Vine Deloria Scholarship Fund, c/o The
American Indian Scholarship Fund, Attn: Rick Williams, 8333 Greenwood
Blvd., Denver, CO  80221.

Thank you (and the others) for bringing
out his work. SHAKE HANDS and NALTSUS BICHIDIN (1 & 2) are this century's

The problem is, and I knew Bob as a dear friend, and I
haven't read the preceding messages, but how? For fuck
sake how? Seems pretty elemementary to me -- and I
apologize if I'm late (and no disrespect to anyone).

The Washington Post story this morning about the continuing saga of
SONY/BMG's attempts to destroy our computers in the name of copyright
protection had a sidebar listing the offending CDs -- I checked it out,
thinking maybe it would explain problems I've been having with my own
computer.  None of the CDs I'd purchased was on the list -- but I couldn't
help noticing that THE BEST OF SHEL SILVERSTEIN was on the list -- I always
thought there was something infectious about Uncle Shel's poems.

Steve, Don't get me wrong, in an ideal world I'd be looking at everything sent
my way and no doubt finding manuscripts I really want to publish -- but at
the present time I've got to be realistic about how many books I can afford to
publish and how many manuscripts I have time to earnestly read.  Yrs, Mike

Vine Deloria Jr. was more than a little bit a trickster.  He spoke to
the Portland, OR, Chamber of Commerce at their monthly luncheon about
1996.  All the women came in their black nylons and little patent shoes
and all the men were wearing as close to bespoke suits as they could
manage.  The food was elegant -- the lunch was at the Benson Hotel.
The policy of the CofC is to allow anyone to attend the speeches after
the lunch and sit in rows of chairs to the side.  On this occasion the
chairs were ALL occupied by a pretty rough assortment of Indians and
the CofC folks kept sending nervous glances over.  I was sitting with
the Indians.

Vine had been to Powells and bought himself a book on the Spanish
Inquisition.  "I want to tell you about your religion, which came and
shut mine down because mine was cruel."  Then he went through the book,
showing the torture instruments and giving us the stats about how many
were killed, etc.  The ladies in their patent leather shoes began to
leave, looking green.  The Indians were laughing hard.

A few years later we were on the same Nat Lit bulletin board and I
challenged him over his resistance to the theory that ice dams closed
off the Flathead Valley after the big ice ages, but broke through in
the warm times and let the water come rushing through, carving the
Snake river and the Columbia.   It was an audacious idea at the time.
He thought it was pretty far-fetched.  I sent him references.  He saw
that there was a good case and stopped pushing.

What I'm saying is that he often worked in the method of the students
at Reed College who were rumored to have written in the lav:  "God is
dead,"  signed Nietsche.   And then "Nietsche is dead," signed God.
Deloria was very sharp about the crazy contradictions that turn up in
our civilization when you use the same standards they apply to others.
He was a terrific consciousness-raiser and on a far more solid footing
that many challengers realized until it was too late.

72 is not old.  He died too young.

reviews don't have to be of poetry books or journals.


For instance, people could write about the NEW CONTINUOUS PEASANT album....

Paper Kite Press presents:

nothing but poetry. be there.
Third Friday
Open Mic at the Mansion
Nov.18th
6:30 p.m.

Featuring Mischelle Anthony
from Wilkes University.

Limited OPEN MIC to follow Mischelle=B9s reading.
Arrive early to sign up - 8 slots available.

156 S. Franklin Street -- Wilkes-Barre, PA 18701
For more information call: (570) 328-8658

Mischelle Anthony received her Ph.D. in Early American Literature and
Eighteenth-Century British Literature from Oklahoma State University in
December 2000, specializing in scholarly editing.  During that process, she
wrote many tortured poems and even published a few in Calyx, A Room of One=
=B9s
Own, and Midland Review, among others.  Since moving to NEPA, she
infiltrates open mike readings shamelessly with her dirges about being a
woman in the world.  She facilitates impromptu poetry workshops in coffee
shops, buses, and Kirby Hall, where she also is Assistant Professor of
English.  In addition to sponsoring The Vagina Monologues and Wilkes=B9
creative writing magazine Manuscript, Mischelle also feels compelled to
correct misconceptions about American history through essay offerings to
encyclopedias, scholarly journals and local newspapers. (The founding
fathers, for example, were neither Christian nor for a completely
representative government, and the Puritans were, actually, way into sex.)


81 South, October

Sun beams riot
with clouds
as fiery autumn
complicates
the cool green.

Dark birds and golden oak
leaves wheel across the blue,
startle my highway gaze.

Please take care
of my heart.

- Mischelle Anthony

(ok, you Olson fanatics, what would be the SMS version of Maximus
Poems?)

'Literary' texts no more?
Project reduces classic works to text messages

Thursday, November 17, 2005; Posted: 2:32 p.m. EST (19:32 GMT)

LONDON, England (AP) -- "Romeo, Romeo -- wher4 Rt thou Romeo?"

It could be the future of Shakespeare.

Dot mobile, a British mobile phone service aimed at students, says it
plans to condense classic works of literature into SMS text messages.
The company claims the service will be a valuable resource for
studying for exams.

Academic purists will be horrified. Hamlet's famous query, "To be or
not to be, that is the question," becomes "2b? Nt2b? ???"

John Milton's epic poem "Paradise Lost" begins "devl kikd outa hevn
coz jelus of jesus&strts war." ("The devil is kicked out of heaven
because he is jealous of Jesus and starts a war.")

Some may dismiss the summaries as cheat notes for the attention-
deficit generation, but John Sutherland, a University College London
English professor who consulted on the project, said they could act
as a useful memory aid.

"The educational opportunities it offers are immense," said
Sutherland, who chaired the judging panel for this year's Booker
Prize for fiction.
Sutherland said the compressed nature of text messages allowed them
to "fillet out the important elements in a plot."

"Take for example the ending to Jane Eyre --
'MadwyfSetsFyr2Haus.' (Mad wife sets fire to house.) Was ever a
climax better compressed?"

But political commentator and author Oliver Kamm said the terse texts
were "more than a travesty."

"What you lose with text messaging in literature is what makes
literature what it is -- the imagery, the irony, the nuance," he told
British Broadcasting Corp. radio.

"What I fear will happen with text versions of Shakespeare is that
students will be encouraged not to read the books but to settle for
something else, and people don't need excuses not to read books. They
don't read enough as it is."

Books planned for the service include Charles Dickens' "Bleak House,"
whose tale of the interminable legal suit of Jarndyce and Jarndyce is
reduced to a few snappy lines, and Jane Austen's "Pride and
Prejudice," which describes hunky Mr. Darcy as "fit&loadd" (handsome
and wealthy).

Dot mobile said it planned to launch the service in January, with
Shakespeare's complete works available by April. The texts will be
free to subscribers to the company's phone service.

The English Department is one of the largest academic units at UW-SP.
Some 30 faculty offer a full range of classes from freshman composition
and humanities GDRs to upper-division literature, writing, and teacher
education classes fulfilling the requirements of our Major/Minors. Our
commitment to teaching is of primary importance, but department members
also manage to engage productively in a variety of scholarly and
creative projects. We have almost an even mix of experienced and
relatively recent faculty members and, as we continue to grow, we are
dedicated to increasing the diversity of our department and of the
institution as a whole.

UW-SP is located in Stevens Point on the Wisconsin River, almost
precisely in the center of the state. It is the only degree-granting
institution in north-central Wisconsin, offering 54 undergraduate majors
and masters degrees in 12 disciplines, including the M.S.T. (English).
Enrollment is 8000-8500 students, served by over 400 faculty, over 200
academic staff, and about 350 support staff members. The campus contains
both historic and contemporary buildings in an attractively landscaped
setting, bounded on one side by a 200-acre nature preserve with its
man-made lake.

length and uses language, rather than temporal events, as the first =20
given. Glimpses of action, person (not as in fiction, =93character=94), =20=

and scene may also appear in them. Prose poems are less calculating =20
than fiction and less tightly crafted than a short story or short =20
poem; they are less pre-meditated. Perhaps they are more rhythmic.

Subject:      Looking for Publisher for "book-length prose poem"

Dear List:

I recently finished a novel and am looking for names of
presses/publishers/agents. The work has been termed a "book-length prose
poem" which agents in NY have (one after another since May) turned down
for being too poetic and "not commercial enough."

Most of it is nonfiction with a fictional story as a backdrop, or
skeleton to hold it up. Themes are people who go missing and Elvis
Presley... a girl is abducted in a forest fire in suburban LA in 1976 by
a someone dressed as Elvis (dead 10 months hence) and it's now 30 years
later (2005 and after) and each person who lived in town at the time:
the girl's best friend, a police officer, a psychic, a swami, an
astronomer, an AM radio paranormal talk show host, and finally the girl
herself- all offer explanation about who or what abducted her. It took 3
years to write and research. 134,000 words. The narrative is straight
and at other times is a long list of accounts of the missing or details
of Elvis' life/music or it veers off in a nonlinear way. It's lyrical
fiction yet has an almost trash-fiction quality that mixes with the
intense, thick language.

If anyone has any referrals, names of small presses (web or not) open to
offbeat work, or ideas besides a recycle bin at this point please b/c
burketATmail2southamericaDOTcom (yes, the numeral ?"). Attachments won't
make it to my inbox at all. Thank you and I love you.

Fresh goods from local zones - images & text off the Valencia Street (San

Raising the question, though not necessarily:
How does the image protect itself against the onslaught of text?
When do they cooperate?
When do they betray each other?
How does an object - found or otherwise - give birth to language?
Do objects (closely witnessed) reconfigure the lost (destroyed?) art of
metaphor?

CALL TO ACTION MEETING: SAVE TOOKIE WILLIAMS

Date: Saturday, November 19th
Where: St. Mary's Church of Harlem
Time: 3-5 PM

The Campaign to End the Death Penalty, New York Chapter, and the NYC
Free Mumia Abu Jamal Coalition is putting out a call for all NY area
anti-prison and anti-death penalty organizations and individuals to
come together and strategize avenues for action to save Tookie
Williams (see description below). All are welcome.

The aim for this gathering is to collectively facilitate a strategic
action agenda for the upcoming weeks before Tookie's clemency ruling
and date of execution (Dec. 13, 2005). We must act NOW!

Come to this meeting to:
* organize for the national day of action for Tookie and other events
* discuss how our organizations can support each other in our organizing
* strategize petition drive
* build a strong network of anti-death penalty and anti-prison
organizations in NY

Tookie Williams was one of the founders of the Crips street gang. In
1981, he was convicted of four murders, sentenced to death, and
incarcerated on San Quentin's death row. While Tookie has maintained
innocence with respect to the crimes he was convicted of, he has
openly apologized for his role in forming the Crips gang and has
become a prominent anti-gang spokesman. In addition to writing an
anti-gang book series for children, Tookie has initiated gang truces
and inspired many through his talks to at-risk youth. Stanley has been
nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and for the Nobel Prize in
Literature in recognition for his work. In addition, he has recently
received the President's Call to Service Award. Tookie is set to be
executed on December 13, 2005.

2005 International Dub Poetry Festival Part II: Dubbing the Elements
November 24-27, Toronto (various locations)


Wind and rain, earth and fire; as the season changes, the Dub Poets
Collective shouts November to a close with "Dubbing the Elements;" the
second half of the 2005 International Dub Poetry Festival.

 From November 24 - 27, some of the most provocative poets, performers
and thinkers in the Americas converge upon Toronto.  Words and rhythms
their only weapons, they come to challenge the mind, excite the spirit
and chant down the status quo.  Join us for:
Ã˜      four nights of performance, including a youth poetry slam &
competition with prizes;
Ã˜      three days of panel discussions, including a youth discussion on
poetics and performance, the history of dub poetry, and the challenges
of translating the voice to the page;
Ã˜      a rediscovery of the works of Phillis Wheatley, America's first
published black poet;
Ã˜      the triumphant launch of collective member Klyde Broox's book of
poetry, "My Best Friend is White."

Festival guests include: Kateri Akiwenzie-Damm (Cape Croker Reserve,
Ontario); Michael Bennett (Jamaica); George Elliott Clarke (Toronto);
Melville Cooke (Jamaica); Shauntay Grant (Halifax); Oni the Haitian
Sensation (Ottawa); Peculiar I (Toronto); Ras Mykkal (Bermuda); Eintou
Springer (Trinidad & Tobago); Samuel Fure Davis (Cuba).

Formed in 2003, the Dub Poets Collective is a creative organization
totally dedicated to promoting dub poetry as a vital cultural practice.
The DPC is also committed to the enhancement of other spoken word
genres. Since our first main festival in June of 2004, we have been
working hard to engage Toronto and the greater world in the rhythms and
reasoning of dub and dubbing towards enlightenment and overstanding.
DPC members include Klyde Broox, Afua Cooper, Clifton Joseph, Sankofa
Juba, Chet Singh, and dâ€™bi.young.

Evening performances:
Thursday Nov. 24          Opening night: "Dubbing the Elements"

Hi Lea:

Some presses that continue to impress include:

Burning Deck Press http://www.burningdeck.com/
Chax Press http://chax.org/
Coracle http://www.coracle.ie/
Ugly Duckling Presse http://www.uglyducklingpresse.org/
Phylum Press http://www.phylumpress.com/
Poltroon Press http://www.poltroonpress.com/
Tougher Disguises http://www.tougherdisguises.com/
Verdant Press http://www.verdantpress.com/

As Charles said, I'm sure there are more=8Bmany more. If you have a library
with a fair special collection in the neighborhood, it might be interesting
to looking back 50 years or so. In the Bay Area, for example, there was
Zephyrus Image, White Rabbit, Tuumba, Auerhahn and Dave Haselwood Books,
Semina, Cranium, Oyez, Four Zoas, etc. etc. All examples of fine printing,
great poetry and some works pre-date what came to be known as the =B3artists=B9
book.=B2=20

Cheers,

Palm Press in California does a wonderful job, www.palmpress.org

The book design is very responsive to the individual project; also -- and =
I speak from experience -- Jane Sprague gives intense and loving attention =
to detail, e.g., difficult formatting, and to all elements material and =
otherwise of the enterprise.

Out-Roving the Rovians

=09As far as I can determine Harold Pinter will be delivering his speech
accepting the

Nobel Peace Prize for literature on December 10.  In light of recent events
here I would

guess that this might lead to some adverse press and =93dirty tricks=94 by some.

=09As a disabled veteran, retired psychologist and poet I feel that this is
unfortunate.

One of the criticisms might be that he is mixing politics and art.  My only
answer to that

would to use some lines from one of his plays (Ashes to Ashes) that critics
should read

and understand before they criticize him:

I absolutely second this.  Bill Mazza who designs the Belladonna* series =
does impeccable work.  The Wild Honey chapbooks and list are non pareil.

Chapbooks have saved me from despair. =20

A funny thing: people outside the poetry business will say "What's a =

I say "I think it's a chapter book." =20

So glad to be a chap with a few chapbooks,

The altered books project is a series of ongoing collaborations being
done by me and the other artists listed at the site; the site is a
chronicle of this specific set of collaborations. It isn't accepting
outside submissions of pages--though I'm happy to make a link in the
sidebar to other things by other people if they're altered books
related.

The way the project works is this:

I bought two copies of a book (usually a western or a romance)

I cut the binding off of one copy

I took a grease pencil to the odd numbered side of the first page of
the unbound copy and found "my" poem.

I mailed each participant a) the bound copy of the book for their
reference (planning ahead, or, if their chosen methods of alteration
bleed through from "their" side to "my" side, they can cut a page out,
or, I suppose someone could cut it up to use for collaging if they
wanted--the point being it's a purely optional object that I send
along for them to use or not use as they see fit), b) a grease pencil
just to get them started, obviously many people have moved away from
using that as their sole means of altering, and c) the single loose
page on which I'd altered the odd numbered page.

Then each participant took the single, one-side-done page and altered
the other side, their side, the even numbered side.

That single, now altered on both sides, page gets mailed back to me
and when I receive it, I alter and send along the next page in that
book. And so on.

So, each person is going to end up doing all the even numbered pages
in one single title. And I'm going to end up doing all of the odd
numbered pages in every title.

But thanks for your interest, if I hear of a site that is open to
submissions of altered pages, I'll let you know.

Regards,
Dan

friends,

the good guys don't often win this big, so i wanted to share with you
some news i heard through the grapevine (from a little birdie):
charles alexander is the 2006 arizona arts award recipient.  it's a
huge deal.  apparently a ceremony was involved, as was champagne (and
an excellent vintage, at that -- piper-heidsieck, i believe -- not
1995, regretably, but '98 was not a bad year).

no one deserves a fete-ing more.  many congrats, charles.

Making up for a lost four months, two more reviews up on rhubarb. I won't
post another update for at least a week; apologies if I trip your spam
detectors.

Up this Saturday we have two reviews, one of Heather Christle from
Octopus, and one of Karol Wojtyla translated by Jerzy Peterkiewicz:

BRITISH-ARAB LITERARY FESTIVAL
Reply to: Pablo.Ganguli@lycos.co.uk
---

I recently organised the Marrakech International Literary and Arts
Festival which helped strengthen British-Moroccan cultural relations.
Next April,
the UK-Indian festival of literature called the Kitab Festival will be
held in
Kolkata. Clare Short MP, William Dalrymple, Liz Calder of Bloomsbury,
Katharine
Viner of the Guardian Newspaper, Boyd Tonkin, Literary Editor of the
Independent,
Hari Kunzru to name but a few participants will be coming to the festival.

I am now planning the first ever UK-Arab Literary Festival to be held
in London, UK next year. Grateful if you would kindly recommend Arab and
British
authors/literary figures who you think should definitely participate.
Perhaps you could suggest a name for the festival? This proposed festival
will also celebrate the festival of muslim cultures that is going to
take place
all over Britain in 2006.

Finally, could you please pass this message on to all those contacts
who in your
view would be interested in hearing more about the festival's
development.

With many thanks,

Whether you are escaping the encroaching darkness of winter or the impending
visits to your in-laws, winter is the best season to escape into a book. And
forget about who's wearing the red robe at the North Pole when the South
Pole is where all the epic action is at. Take it from George Belden, who
claimed to be on Robert Falcon Scott's tragic expedition to reach the South
Pole almost 100 years ago. Now, thanks to Norman Lock's brilliant
"discovery" of Belden's journals, which otherwise might have been forever
lost to the elements of post-modern literature, Calamari Press is offering
George Belden's Land of the Snow Men, along with one other Calamari Press
title of your choice for $12. Go here for details:
http://calamaripress.com/2005WWO.htm

Other Calamari Press news:

* Congratulations are in order for Peter Markus, who was chosen to
participate in the PEN/Faulkner's Writers in Schools program in Washington,
DC. in January 2006. If you are in the NYC area, Peter Markus will read at a
mud/song/art event with poet William Corbett, musician Langhorne Slim and
artist Josh Dorman at the Pierogi Gallery in Brooklyn
(http://www.pierogi2000.com/wburg.html) on Dec. 19th at 7 PM.

Too Much Bliss: Twenty Years of Granary Books
40 Artists=92 Books on View at Smith College Museum of Art
November 12, 2005 =96 February 19, 2006

SEE WEBSITE:=20
http://www.smith.edu/artmuseum/exhibitions/granarybooks/index.htm

Northampton, MA November 1, 2005 =96 Too Much Bliss celebrates the work=20=

of Granary Books,
publisher and catalyst for the creation of some of the country=92s most=20=

innovative artists=92 books, and a key
entity in the fields of poetry and scholarship on the history of the=20
book arts. The exhibition focuses on 40
limited-edition artists=92 books, including collaborations between a=20
diverse selection of important artists,
writers, poets, printers, and binders such as Susan Bee, Charles=20
Bernstein, Ted Berrigan, John Cage,
Henrik Drescher, Johanna Drucker, Larry Fagin, Phillip Gallo, Barbara=20
Fahrner, Yvonne Jacquette,
Daniel Kelm, Jerome Rothenberg, Carolee Schneeman, Anne Waldman, and=20
Jonathan Williams.
[Please read through end of press release for related program=20
information.]

Serving the vital function of bringing together writers, artists, and=20
bookmakers to investigate verbal/visual
relations through the making of artists=92 books, Granary=92s mission is =
to=20
produce, promote, document, and
theorize new works exploring the intersection of word, image, and page.=20=

Since 1985, Granary Press has
produced over 100 outstanding publications, including artists=92 books,=20=

books on poetry and music, and
scholarly writing about the history of books. This exhibition=20
celebrates Granary Books=92s twentieth year of
operation, featuring 40 examples of artists=92 books, and displaying =
what=20
has earned them the reputation as
one of the most unique and significant small publishers operating today.

Initially, founder and director Steve Clay regarded Granary Books as a=20=

vehicle for the distribution of
small press books, particularly poetry, with a lot of attention paid to=20=

the crafts of bookmaking=97printing,
papermaking, and binding. Granary Books occasionally produced small=20
broadsides and ephemeral
pamphlets until the early 1990s, when a conversation between Clay and=20
artist Barbara Farhner sparked the
production of Nods, a book that combined the talents of Farhner,=20
letterpress printer Philip Gallo, binder
Daniel Kelm (who operates The Wide Awake Garage in Easthampton), and an=20=

existing text by the avantgarde
composer/writer/artist John Cage. This spontaneous collaborative effort=20=

brought to life Clay=92s view
of the book as an interactive process involving writer, visual artist,=20=

typographer, binder, and reader, and
reaffirmed his sense of the creative role of the publisher.

Since that time, Granary Books has branched out, producing important=20
scholarly texts on the history of
writing, poetry, and the book arts, which are printed in trade editions=20=

and are widely available, alongside
limited edition books that display the cross-media creativity for which=20=

Granary has become known.

While the exhibition primarily focuses on the limited-edition artists=92=20=

books produced by Granary, a
reading room within the gallery allows viewers to peruse the trade=20
editions, representing the full scope of
Granary Books=92s unique creations. Some works in the exhibition =
indicate=20
a local collection where that
item can be seen in its entirety, as only selected pages are shown in=20
the exhibition. We encourage
everyone who sees the exhibition to visit these local collections and=20
experience the books fully
themselves.

Presentation of Too Much Bliss: Twenty Years of Granary Books at the=20
Smith College Museum of Art
has been made possible in part by a gift from the estate of Selma P.=20
Seltzer. Exhibitions and programs at
the museum are also supported by the Tyron Associates, Friends of the=20
Museum, and the Museum Shop.
Media sponsorship for this exhibition has been provided by The Valley=20

  Stephen Elliott is the author of the novels Jones Inn, A Life Without Consequences, What It Means To Love You, and Happy Baby.

Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

    The Martian Press is pleased to announce the publication of its fifth
    chapbook: Call & Response. The book began as a selection of 10
    concrete poems by derek beaulieu. Each poem was altered during the
    editing process by Jonathan Ball to create 10 new works. Each work and
    its resulting corruption is presented, back-to-back, on a piece of 8
    1/2 x 11 card stock. The cards are contained in an envelope along with
    an 11th "title page" -- each of which is signed by both authors. The
    chapbook is published in a limited run of 100.

    If you would like a copy of Call & Response then contact me at
    jonathan at jonathanball dot com. Books are $5 each. If they need to
    be mailed out, that's an extra whatever, probably $2. I am also very
    willing to make trades -- I actually prefer this.

Sometimes poetry readings are a big yawn.
But then sometimes...

Wish I had taken notes at the Berrigan COLLECTED event the other day,
it was such a fantastic time!

Most memorable moment for me was Eileen Myles getting up to  the
microphone and saying, "TED BERRIGAN WAS A GREAT BIG LESBIAN!"
That was wonderful!  HEHEHEHE!  With that she shifted the  atmosphere
for the rest of the event, no doubt about it!

SO MANY people in the room, hundreds and hundreds!  That number  of
bodies together to share the Love, well, the current jumps around,  you
feel it, feel us, in there, with it.  Exciting hearing poems you've  read and
always WANTED to hear aloud, other than your own voice that is.

Poems you wanted to hear read aloud with many others there to soak
it in with you.  That was a beautiful thing.

A little like the time VALLEY OF THE DOLLS was showing on the  big
screen in Philadelphia, and you always wanted to see it on the big  screen,
but weren't even alive when it first came out.  Of course you GO see  it!
It's a great big fucking joyful night!  And Ted Berrigan's  poems!  Yeah!

The donuts and Pepsi were also nice.

If you were there, what did you think?

Otherwise, sorry you didn't make it, if you didn't make it.
Wish you could have come over there with us,
you would have enjoyed yourself,

New on PFS Post (www.artrecess.blogspot.com):

  "George Bowering, as he appears in “Blonds on Bikes”, is a serious poet— too serious, in fact, to take poetry all that seriously. Not that he’s formally deficient— he is, in fact, a master of form. Not that he’s glib— there’s pith in his every utterance. It’s just that Bowering has reached a point of such complete and utter comfort with poetry and linguistic nuance that it comes as naturally and effortlessly to him as breathing."

The thing I agree with the most is that it's ridiculous considering  that
there was a previous hardcover and paperback edition with different
covers, FROM ibooks, and Creeley was Creeley then, both times.

I just think they're fucking stoned or something at ibooks.  Which is
fine, I'm not saying don't get stoned, I'm just saying type Creeley in,
THEN take a hit, okay Jacko?  Oh, too late, you already fucked  up.
Shit!

It's such a damned shame because the R.Crumb drawing is good.
It's good even though it's sad, because it's Kerouac after he's  gotten
too much drink in him, and soon to die.  You almost see him  tipping
into the grave with Crumb's ink, a sweat of 90 proof juicing the  sluice.

Kyle, your idea of contacting the publisher is a good one.  Maybe  I'll
do that, now that I'm somewhat calm(ish).

But anyway, Creeley, with a shining "e"
Shiny shiny shiny shiny "e"

    “What is certain is that since 1992, “Tookie” has been a voice reaching out to the voiceless. He has encouraged youth to lift themselves up so as not to end up locked up.

Through his personal transformation in prison, he has brought light to dark places because he knows where to look....

Statement of the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, Sr. Following His Visit
With San Quentin Death Row Inmate Stanley "Tookie" Williams

Tracy K. Rice, Esq.

STATEMENT OF THE REV. JESSE L. JACKSON, SR. FOLLOWING HIS
VISIT WITH SAN QUENTIN DEATH ROW INMATE
STANLEY “TOOKIE” WILLIAMS

“Today I met with “Tookie” Williams, a man who is scheduled to be killed 17
days from today. We had prayer. At the conclusion of our one and a half hour
visit I told him ‘We are going to fight for you and we are going to win.' He
told me that his work here is not finished.

The State of California is gearing up its machinery of death based on the
assumption of the certainty of this man's guilt. The State has a plan of
certainty for his execution. Date certain. Time certain. But there is more
uncertainty about his guilt than there is necessity for execution,” Jackson
stated.

“Tookie” Williams is a changed man. He stands before Governor Swarzenegger
requesting clemency. There are those who state that he should not receive
clemency because he has not acknowledged guilt and remorse. But this is not
a legal requirement for clemency. It cannot be predicated upon a false or
coerced confession of guilt or remorse.

“What is certain is that since 1992, “Tookie” has been a voice reaching out
to the voiceless. He has encouraged youth to lift themselves up so as not to
end up locked up. His voice has reached impoverished and alienated youth in
places police dare not tread. Through his personal transformation in prison,
he has brought light to dark places because he knows where to look. He
speaks truth to power with a sincere knowledge of what lies ahead for these
youth and gives them a stark look at what their future could be if they
don't renounce gang life and all that it stands for. And they listen,
because he was one of them.

“Tookie Williams personifies what “Redemption” is all about. He has used his
time in prison to reach others and save lives. We may not be able to
quantify the number of children he has saved, but I am certain that there
are children in this country and abroad that would not be here had they not
received his powerful message.

"In the days to come we will bear witness to our criminal justice system at
its lowest point. As California gears up for the taking of a life, the eyes
of the world are upon us. We must kill the idea of killing as a remedy to
societal problems and shortcomings. We do not condone “Tookie” Williams past
actions, however, the streets of California will be no safer on December 14
th should he be executed. In fact, there is reason to believe that they will
be even less safe as those he would have reached in his ongoing efforts to
stop children from joining gang life will never hear his message." remarked
Jackson.

“Today I have requested a meeting with Governor Schwarzenegger. I will urge
him to grant clemency and convert Tookie Williams' sentence to life without
possibility of parole. By granting clemency in this case he would be setting
an example of courage over cowardice, of humanity over brutality.
Commutation in this case would follow in the best traditions of Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr., Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi and Cesar Chavez. Gov.
Swarzenegger has the ability to come down on the right side of history and
make it clear by this single act of courage that he remains committed to the
principles of justice.

I will also urge the Governor to halt all executions while the California
Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice conducts a thorough study
of the state's criminal justice procedures. This Commission was formed by
the state Senate in August 2004, “to study and review the administration of
criminal justice in California to determine the extent to which that process
has failed in the past, resulting in wrongful executions of innocent
persons.' There should be a moratorium on all executions pending the
completion of this official governmental body's investigation,” Jackson
declared.

The legislative findings will be presented to the Governor by December 31,
2007.

WORKERS OF THE WORD, UNITE AND FIGHT! examines current crises in the =
literary landscape and book culture of the United States. Nowak's =
influential essay on not-for-profit literary centers in the era of =
corporate mergers ("Open Book, Case Closed: The Democratic Paradox of =
Minnesota's New Literary Center," originally published in Chicago =
Review) is republished here in conjunction with his previously =
unavailable essay, "Neoliberalism, Collective Action, and the American =
MFA Industry"-a challenge to public intellectuals, culture workers, and =
collectives to impede and revise the American MFA industry and its =
subsidiary industries through cultural adjustments. This new essay also =
outlines the interventions of the Union of Radical Workers and Writers =
in its struggle to organize a Borders bookstore in Minneapolis. WORKERS =
OF THE WORD, UNITE AND FIGHT! also includes the poem "Better Dead than =
Bound to Be Read (Bookselling in America at the Millennial Turn),"  =
based on the corporate closure of Bound to Be Read bookstores in =
Albuquerque, NM and Minneapolis, MN.
Mark Nowak is author of Revenants, Shut Up Shut Down (afterword by Amiri =
Baraka), and co-editor (with Diane Glancy) of Visit Teepee Town: Native =
Writings after the Detours, all from Coffee House Press. He is the =
editor of the journal Xcp: Cross Cultural Poetics and founder of the =
Union of Radical Workers and Writers. His verse play "Capitalization" =
(about Reagan's firing of striking PATCO workers) won a development =
grant from the Stage Left Theatre in Chicago, where it premiered in =
2004; another verse play about a Teamster organizer, "Francine Michalek =
Drives Bread", premiered at UAW Local 879 in St. Paul, Minnesota, in =
March 2003. Nowak's essay on gothic-industrial music and =
deindustrialization in America's rust belt is forthcoming in Goth: =
Undead Subculture (Duke University Press).=20

Dear List Members - There's a terrific student of mine from Britain
currently living in New Mexico doing his 'year abroad' thing (University of
New Mexico, Albuquerque).trouble is, he's miserable because he has yet to
meet the poets he dreamed of connecting with.he is now writing long emails
to various functionaries here in England in which he pleads to be moved to
San Francisco.



Do any of you have any knowledge of interesting poetry / art scenes.friendly
ones.that he can at least visit and get a sense of.and people he might want
to contact? (He's twenty years old).don't mean to come off sounding like I'm
hustling a personals ad, but I just hate the idea of a good guy going mad
for no good reason.



Please feel free to contact me at dkane@panix.com

Best,

--daniel

Discussion of an interdisciplinary poetics: from anthropology to poetry to
history and archeology to visual art. Micro and macro level approaches to
theme-based  poetry, art, and creative prose. Use of historical documents,

text and the lyrical, between visuals and words. Questions of subjectivity
and authorial presence. I-witnessing, textual layering, the physical page,
the poet in the library. Some examples from poet Susan Howe, photographer
Lorna Simpson, and others, as well as Jill=B9s projects including the Seneca
Village Series, The March of America Facsimile Series, and text and images
from Threads.  Jill Magi's book, Threads, a hybrid work of poetry, prose,
and collage, is forthcoming in spring 2006 from Futurepoem and her chapbook=

Dear Poetics List:

If you weren't present at the Hy-Art Gallery in Oxford Ohio on Saturday Nov
19th, what you missed was, while perhaps not historical, surely hysterical.
Here's my scuffy gloss w/ plenty of memory leakage.

cris cheek read/wrote his reading/writing of a page from his and Sianed
Jones' Songs From Navigation (Reality Street, 1998) begging the question
WHOSE "house martins" and what could be the sonic corollary to the
difficulty of transcribing a square booked page onto a rectangular sheet of
butcher paper?; William R. Howe delighted and indulged us with selected
poems (namely, "So CRUCIFY Me!" and "sad") by
the-eastern-rim-of-the-Midwest's-rising-star Nannah U. Fosster from her
newly released chapbook The Emergence of Nannah Fosster (Megaphone Piggy,
2005); Keith Tuma and i blubbed and bloviated a slothy rendition of Holiday
in Tikrit (Critical Documents, 2005) with, as a surprise finale, Keith
passing me the mic to climax thru the last of the "fuck you's" as he threw
himself to the floor and brushed his teeth with his finger; there was wine
dripping from our fangs as one Abby Trenaman, one Peter Drummond and myself
read the night's markers smeared across the bare torso of one Pete Castaldo=
;
and this against the backdrop of a pre-flood Lake Pontchartrain glittering
and spiking to the beat of a slowed radio oscillating b/t channels (as
filmed by cheek and Howe during their now-epic 3 Little Heretics
cross-country romp); agent 405-12-3415 cut Richard Simmons against Cold War
instructions for family fallout shelters w/ video of an AC-130's
terrorist-cave-bombing mission; Keith left early of course while video loop=
s
shined and a man in chain-mail god-blessed the English bondage scene for
financing the links on his Hummer; one Aaren Yandrich dic-tate-id his
mock-mock-elegy "A Bird Here" beneath the blue glow of excess simulacra;
Abby Trenaman, kind host, showed her film/sound-work "Vanity Insanity" w/
ample dodgy close-ups of walkway buns; shown was a video by one Todd
Seabrook concerning authorship and ownership and the brand name (critiquing
ad agencies' use of exploitative iconography); and a set of intriguing
transformative translations from Anna Akhmatova poems by one Rachel Smith.

There were works of art on the wall, there is video to be edited, there was
something going down, there was more than i can mention.

Speed of Light

The speed of light is 299,792,458 metres per second. Or approximately
300 million metres per second, or 186 thousand miles per second, or 1
foot per nanosecond. The speed of light, sometimes known as "C" (as in
E=MC2), is a constant of the Universe. However you measure it, it really
is 299,792,458 metres per second precisely, or about 186,282.4 miles per
second.

Sometimes the speed of light is approximated as 300 million and is
written as 3 x 108. To find out about this way of writing big numbers,
see exponential notation <http://www.zyra.org.uk/expno.htm>

This item also crosslinks with Xyroth's "Speed of Light" page
<http://www.xyroth-enterprises.co.uk/c-light.htm> which has the context
of other constants of the Universe, such as the number of dimensions and
the bonding energy etc.

What use is the speed of light in everyday applications? One of its many
uses is in working out radio frequencies and wavelengths
<http://www.zyra.org.uk/freqwav.htm>

"Our intention is to disrupt the empire, to incapacitate it, to put
pressure on the cracks, to make it hard to carry out its bloody
functioning against the people of the world, to join the world struggle,
to attack from the inside. Our intention is to engage the enemy, to wear
away at him, to isolate him, to expose every weakness, to pounce, to
reveal his vulnerability. Our intention is to encourage the people, to
provoke leaps in confidence and consciousness, to stir the imagination,
to popularize power, to agitate, to organize, to join in every possible
way the people's day to day struggles." -- w.u. prairie fire

dead indians

november drizzles a soggy leafed carpet
little burial mounds in the  park
memorialize extinct tribes
under civil war canons
tiny twigs snap  beneath rubber soles
their sound stays at my feet
in muffled foggy  silence
but for a blue jay piercing echo
or a woodpecker shaman drum

clouds break loose
so i sit down
take off my gloves and press my  palms
against the warm black polyvinyl bench
i take off my hat and let my  hair blow free
faced up towards the sun
when the hollow hat blows off the  bench
rolls down to the pond and stops
on the edge

there are times
i miss picking up your empties
cleaning your  ashtray
you know
the plastic turquoise colored one i bought for  you
when you come to visit
after all we have between us now
is  history
it's where everything is headed

The moon is roughly 380,000 km away. So it takes a bit longer than a second
for light to travel from the moon to the earth.

And that's with a very fast connection.

Does the moon's light still travel to the earth when there is no moon?
Is it very slow, like a dial-up connection?
Who gets it? Where does it land?

Goodnight moon. Happy Thanksgiving all.

In a country seemingly gone - or led - more than looney.
All Bang with more than a few dark holes.
Dance on 'em.

270,000 times the distance of the sun to the earth

  4.35 light years= travelling 299,792,458 metres per second for 4.35 years.  Or 9.5 quintrillion miles.

  Travelling at 55 mph, it would take us roughly 19,650,000,000 years to get there, depending on the bathroom stops.

  How many McDonalds would there be?  That's what I want to know.

On November 11, 2005, eight people were arrested at an anti-war
demonstration during an event featuring Colin Powell at De Anza
Community College Campus in Cupertino, California. One person was
arrested inside the hall disrupting Powell's speech. Seven students
were racially and religiously profiled and brutally arrested by
Sheriffs outside the hall.

Please visit the A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition web site and use a simple
mechanism to send District Attorney of Santa Clara County George
Kennedy a message demanding that the charges against students
arrested be dropped and that the Santa Clara County Sheriffs
Department be investigated and punished for their racial and
religious profiling and brutality.

Nec laudas nisi mortuos poetas: tanti non est, ut placeam, perire [i]=20

Hello and welcome to the table. This is the fourth year of our =
Thanksgiving
day poems. This series is designed around a dinner menu and acts as a
communal poetry gathering. This menu dinner was planned and sketched out =
in
December of last year. I asked for and kindly received permission to =
write
this before his death. It was not intended as an ultimate tribute, as it
must unfortunately become. Thus, I am committing myself to making this =
years
trivial menu series into something that I may not be able to accomplish.
Therefore, I apologize, and it is rightly needed as my poetic acumen is
stridently contrasted to what is needed. So I humbly ask you to read =
this in
the spirit it was conceived and not as the crowning achievement it =
should
be.

Thank you, Geoffrey Gatza

The moonlight is so there, fresh, one second away. Only an emotion away or
erm less.

Sunlight is a blessing. At least here in Victoria. Eight point three minutes
in its journey from the nuclear core one durst not look upon. The time it
takes to smoke a long cigarette.

Alpha Centauri, the nearest star to our home of crumbs and manna, is four
years on a beam of light from here. The length of time it takes a babe to
learn (or grow) to remember, or some dreams to be registered upon wishing on
a star.

On his birthday, Robert Keppler used to say "another trip around the sun."
These cosmic measures of our earthly lives.

Happy Thanksgiving everyone.

This was just sent to me - so i thought i would pass it along
They are looking for 2 teachers to teach english in Seoul!
pay is $2000 Can? a month with free apartment and free transport



Dear Adeena Karasick,

I'm sending you this e-mail because you're a writer and thus might know
people that would be interested in the following job offer.  I apologize if this is
of no interest to you or anyone you know.  Once you've read it please feel
free to delete this with extreme prejudice :)

My name is Jodie McNamara.  Two years ago I moved to Montreal upon having
completed a two year teaching contract at a school in South Korea.  My experience
there was tremendously positive due in most part to my having been placed in
a good school.  I might have stayed a good deal longer if I hadn't been so
homesick :)

Two of my co-workers that did stay are leaving the school at the end of
December and the director has asked me to find her new teachers.  I would like for

Jim,

Here is a poem by Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet about time and politics and jail
time. Happy Thanksgiving to you all:

Since I Was Put...

Since I was put in this hole
The earth has gone round ten times.
If you ask the Earth, it'll say,
                  "don't mention it,
                   such a microscopic amount of time."
If you ask me,
                         "Ten years of my life."

The day I was imprisoned
             I had a small pencil
Which I used up in a week.
If you ask the pencil, it'll say,
             "My entire life time."
If you ask me, I'll say,
              "So what, only a week."

Osman, serving a sentence for murder
              when I first came to this hole,
               left after seven years and a half;
               enjoyed life outside a while
               then he came back for smuggling
               and left at the end of six months.
               Someone heard the news yesterday, he's married.
               He'll have a child come spring.

The children conceived
             the day I was put into this hole
are now celebrating their tenth year.
The foals born trembling on their thin,
               long legs that very day
Must now be lazy
                       mares shaking their wide rumps.
But the young olive shoots are still young,
             still growing.

They tell me new squares are built
              in my own town since I came here.
And my family in that little house
         is now living
           in a street I don't know
              in a house I can't see.

The bread was white as virgin cotton
the year I was put into this hole
and then it was rationed.
Here, in the cells,
             people killed each other
                     for handfuls of black crumbs.
Now things are a bit better
but the bread we eat has no taste.

The year I was put into this hole
                   World War II hadn't started.
In the concentration camps of Dachau
the gas ovens hadn't been built.
The atom bomb had not exploded in Hiroshima.
Oh, time has just flown
              like the blood of a butchered baby.
Now that it's over
         the American dollar
          is already talking
          of a third World War...

All the same, the day is brighter now
            than before
                    when I was thrown in this hole.
Since then
               my people have raised themselves
                  half way up on their elbows.
The earth has gone round the sun
                                                  ten times...
But I repeat with the same yearning
             what I wrote for my people
                        ten years ago today:
"You are as plenty
            as the ants in the earth
               as the fish in the sea
                  as the birds in the sky...
You may be cowardly or brave
         literate or illiterate,
       and since you are the makers
           or destroyers
                          of all deeds,
only your adventures
       will be recorded in song."
The rest,
          such as my ten years' ordeal,
          is mere idle talk.

noirs  (the unrated artist - for odilon redon)


blinded by evil glory
a large bird
descends from the eye balloon
hurtling itself against her hair
within the precarious glimmering of
haunted light
in a window
within the precarious glimmering of
haunted light
the ghost of christ
in the shape of a serpent
closes its eyes
avoiding evil glory
the seated woman's fear of battle
is only heightened by the precarious
glimmering
of haunted light
while
the baptist & saint anthony
tempted by the serpent christ
watch their heads roll from platters
toward the
trees on a rocky slope
@ daybreak against the blue sky
near a beach of rocks
touched by the precarious glimmering
of haunted light
thru the window of a fishing boat
where christ the serpent
& a seated woman battling fear
reside among the black winged angels
& a winged horseman &
a centaur who aims his arrows
@ the clouds
while descending toward hell
@ the bottom of a well
where the precarious glimmering
of haunted light lies
trapped
within the degeneration of imaginary figures
where fairy convicts dwell
beside a burning sobbing bodiless orpheus
& a hideous smiling polyped cyclops
whose eye is shattered by the precarious glimmering
of haunted light
as he questions his feet & where they might take him
he planted on the earth
like a tree on a rocky slope
near a beach of rocks where a fishing boat waits
in the murky light which is very much different tho similar to
the precarious glimmering of haunted light
where within the window the serpent christ sits
opening toward terror
onto the backdrop of our nights
& the germination of stars
while tempted by sanity
the heart has its reasons for creating evil glory
from a precarious glimmering of haunted light
where the beautiful woman closes her eyes
& touches her hair while battling fear as the bird
settles down
builds a nest in her hair
making death's head the only real juror now.

the paintings of elizabeth murray

1. shrinking lines


night
mirrors
an empire of shrinking
lines
tangled & trembling
within the true air of this
wonderful world

a beam of light
raises itself like a glass of beer
@ noon
& the alphabet flies by like a long arm
tugging at itself
near the entrance to where the children
meet
think
join
fall
fly
become a mobius
of
heart &
mind
then leap like the heartbeats of
beginners
into the spiraling
waves.

2. do the dance

can you hear me
from where you are?
i've been off the farm a long time
& been defying the laws of arithmetic
more than you'll ever know
searching for things to come

don't be too cruel
my feet are trembling in the
hollow canal
    (ah my kingdom for a shoe)
another you
sketched within my sketch books

what is love? you ask
it is a dog bounding as it unlocks its
tongue
a bed of waxen water
at the bottom of a summer wind
a top poppin offa da lowdown
bare boppin @ the showdown
swoopin the sun @ the moon
from their saucers
& saucerin 'em back to the sky
where they will dance once again
amongst the bowtied
constellations.

Conclave Obscurum ( http://www.conclaveobscurum.ru )  by Oleg Paschenko,
Ivan Dembicki, and Alexei Bazunov is an artistic project of considerable
beauty and impact. Visual poets will take note of the animated script. You
won't have seen this approach before. Designers will note the complex
interweaving of the hand and the machine. Programmers will appreciate the
approach to interface. The audio is minimal and strongly atmospheric.

Subtle. Russian. The site has been up for years. I visit it from time to
time. And note that the project is ongoing.

Thank you for the Marxist website of Nazim Hikmet's poems
(http://www.marxists.org/subject/art/literature/nazim/index.htm) . Who are the translators. Are
Blazing and Konuk the translators only of the Gioconda poem or also of all the
others?

Featured guests, Malaika Favorite and Anthony Kellman
at The Gold Mine Saloon

M a l a i k a  F A V O R I T E

Malaika Favorite is a self-employed artist and writer residing in Atlanta, Georgia. She received her B.F.A. and M.F.A. from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Favorite has taught at various educational institutions including Grambling State University in Grambling, Louisiana; Episcopal High School in Baton Rouge, where she was artist in residence; Louisiana State University; and Augusta College in Augusta, Georgia. She was also the artist in residence for the Baton Rouge Arts Council. Among her many accomplishments are her published collection of poems and prints. The title of her book is Illuminated Manuscript published by New Orleans Poetry Journal Press. Favorite has exhibited throughout the nation. Some of her creative collections are held at the Morris Museum of Art in Augusta, Georgia; the Alexander Museum of Art in Alexandra, Louisiana; the National Ecumenical Museum of Art in St. Louis, Missouri; the River Road African American Museum in Burnside, Louisiana, t
he Coca Cola Museum in Atlanta, Georgia; and at Absolute Vodka in New York. In 1998, Favorite was commissioned by the Fulton County Arts Council to create 28 paintings for the Harriett G. Darnell Multipurpose Facility.


A n t h o n y  K E L L M A N

Anthony Kellman was born in Barbados in 1955, educated at Combermere School, at UWI (Cave Hill) and in the U.S. At eighteen he left for Britain where he worked as a troubadour playing pop and West Indian folk music on the pub and folk club circuit. He recalls that this was ?glamorous and a great deal of fun?, but when the ?harsh realities? of living as a full-time musician set in, he enrolled in a journalism training programme. During the 1980s he returned to Barbados where he worked as a newspaper reporter, then worked part-time to pay his way through UWI (Cave Hill) where he did a BA in English and History. Afterwards he worked in PR for the Central Bank of Barbados, experiences which he drew on in writing The Coral Rooms. As part of this job he was involved in organising art exhibitions and readings. At this time he published two poetry chapbooks, In Depths of Burning Lights (1982) and The Broken Sun (1984), which drew praise from Kamau Brathwaite, among others. In 1987 he
 left Barbados for the USA where he studied for a Masters of Fine Arts degree in Creative Writing at Lousiana State University. After completing in 1989 he moved to Augusta State University, Georgia, where he is a professor of English and creative writing. He finds considerable resonances between the Caribbean and the Southern states in the USA, which feed into his poetry, where blue jays, dogwoods and wisteria rub shoulders with angel fish, sugarcane and coral reefs. In 1990 Peepal Tree published his third book of poetry, Watercourse, (which appeared with a glowing endorsement from Edouard Glissant), the novel, The Coral Rooms (1994), The Long Gap (1996) and Wings of a Stranger (2000). A second novel, The Houses of Alphonso was published in 2004. All his work has a powerful involvement with landscape, both as a living entity shaping peoples? lives and as a source of metaphor for inner processes. The limestone caves of Barbados have provided a particularly fertile source of i
nspiration. He is currently working on a long narrative poem written in the rhythms of tuk, the indigenous musical form of Barbados. In 1992 he edited the first full-length U.S. anthology of English-speaking Caribbean poetry, Crossing Water. A recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship, his poetry, fiction and critical essays have appeared in journals all over the world. An account of his own writing processes can be found in ?The Revisionary Interior Image: A Caribbean Author Explores his Work?, in Studies in the Literary Imagination, Georgia State University, Vol XXVI, No. 2, 1993.

          Swelter by Elise Ficarra
  Chapbook Release Reading
          with guest reader Robin Romm


          Join us in celebrating the release of the chapbook Swelter that is:


      "Exploratory  in form yet ultimately grounded in, and devoted to, everyday  experience.  Elise Ficarra's Swelter seeks to rescue te lyric during  the latest war's assault on our senses." -Brian Henry


      "Where  words foreshadow and mirror each other in Elise Ficarra's Swelter,  where we apprehedn their correspondences, our re-reading is always a  first reading--startling--as of a poem which can be inhabited in  multiple dimensions at once." -Benjamin Hollander


      "These brilliant and engaging poems   do double time as the world's most innovative and advanced Ouija  board." -Stacy Doris


  About the Author:

hi poetics friends.....as some of you know, amina cain
and i have started a new reading series in chicago.
each RED ROVER event is designed as a reading
experiment with participation by local and national
writers.

we're currently looking for proposals for our 2006
season and want to see your ideas for reading
instructions, experiments, themes, etc.  if any folks
are passing through chicago, we'd be happy to have you
participate.  long distance collaborators are also
welcome.

onwards,
jennifer karmin

Red Rover Series
{readings that play with reading}

Experiment #5:
Greek Translations

Featuring:
Asimina Chremos
John Tipton

7pm Saturday, December 3rd
at the SpareRoom
2416 W. North Ave, Chicago
suggested donation $3
http://www.spareroomchicago.org

Dancer/choreographer ASIMINA CHREMOS works as Dance
Editor for Time Out Chicago magazine.  She was an
active member of the Philadelphia creative community
for over ten years, with occasional forays into New
York City via Dixon Place, PS 122, Movement Research
and the Gowanus Arts Exchange (now BAX). Currently
Asimina resides in Chicago, where she was the Artistic
Director of Links Hall from 2000 - 2004.  A 2005 grant
recipient from the Chicago Dancemakers Forum, she
continues to develop and facilitate performance,
workshops, classes, discourse, and other dance
activities on a freelance basis.
http://www.asiminachremosdance.net

In the reading/performance piece "A NEW GREEK READER,"
dancer Asimina Chremos uses her skills as a dancer and
performer to interpret the educational text "A New
Greek Reader," published by the Harvard University
Press.  The publication date of the book, 1954,
precedes by only a few years her father's emigration
to the U.S. from Greece. The Reader contains texts in
Ancient Greek by Herodotus, Plato, Thucydides,
Aristotle et. al., a language similar to—but not the
same as—the language spoken by Chremos's father and
spoken by Greeks today. Despite having grown up with
intermittent exposure to the sounds and of the Greek
language, and the visual impressions of Greek alphabet
shapes, Chremos herself (whose entire life has been
spent in North America), is not near fluent in Greek
of any type.  In a very personal approach to the text,
Chremos links sounds, meanings, visceral impressions,
memories and learning.

JOHN TIPTON is the author of "surfaces" (Flood, 2004)
and director of the Chicago Poetry Project.
http://www.chicagopoetryproject.org

With a few guest performers, John Tipton will read
from his translation of "The Ajax," perhaps the
earliest of Sophocles' surviving plays. It relates the
madness and suicide of Ajax, the greatest Greek hero
at Troy after Achilles.  Following Achilles' death,
his arms were awarded to Odysseus under questionable
circumstances. Ajax believed they were his by right of
strength; he was after all the strongest Greek left
alive. He became furious and set out one night to kill
Odysseus and other Greek captains. Athena, the patron
of Odysseus, drives Ajax mad so that he attacks a herd
of cattle, thinking the animals are the Greeks he
seeks to murder. The next morning Ajax comes to his
senses and realizes what he's done. He reflects on the
reversals in his life and then commits suicide in
shame. The remaining third of the play is an argument
over the fate of his body. His half-brother Teucer
arrives too late to save him so he makes plans to bury
him. He has to face Menelaus and Agamemnon in turn,
each forbidding the burial. Strangely, in the end
Odysseus arrives to intervene on Ajax' behalf and
convince Agamemnon to allow the burial.

Red Rover Series is curated bi-monthly
by Amina Cain and Jennifer Karmin

Folks might disagree on that:

Conservatives-- The universe as it is . . .

Liberals/progressives-- The universe as it might be . . .

Idealists-- The universe as it seems to be . . .

Here is an interesting page concerning the sculptural poetry of Spains's
Joan Brossa: http://www.spaindev.pomona.edu/barcelona/brossa.html

From the "commentary":

"SSomebody told me one time that the first man who compared a woman to a
flower was a poet, but the second was simply an imbecile." For over fifty
years Joan Brossa has been investigating the link between metaphor and
image, inventing what he calls "object poems" that have the autonomy and
power of a poem yet include no words."

Here is an interesting page concerning the sculptural poetry of Spains's
Joan Brossa: http://www.spaindev.pomona.edu/barcelona/brossa.html

From the "commentary":

"SSomebody told me one time that the first man who compared a woman to a
flower was a poet, but the second was simply an imbecile." For over fifty
years Joan Brossa has been investigating the link between metaphor and
image, inventing what he calls "object poems" that have the autonomy and
power of a poem yet include no words."

Thank you so much Jim-
yes--Brossa is a Catalan--
i have a friend who has known of him for some time--and translated some
things of his--from catalan-
there is a realtionship with the object, the actual forms--in many
Catalans--Picasso, Joan Miro Gaudi--the object itself as a speaking
form--and a form of writing--
and form of dance--

I just read in this morning's PARADE magazine (that irreplaceable source for
poetry news) that Denzel Washington is planning to make a movie about Melvin B.
Tolson.  The news item makes no mention of poetry, so I assume the movie will
be rather like COACH CARTER but about a debate team instead of basketball.
Maybe they'll at least show Tolson looking thoughtful at a typewriter at some
point in the film.

I think I see: Catalunya is part of Spain but Spanish is not the language
generally spoken. So that they usually wouldn't call themselves Spanish but
Catalan. Correct?

I like what I've seen of Brossa's work on the Web. Anyone else have some
interesting links to his work? I searched around a bit but couldn't find
anything as good as the link I sent before.

if you are interested in algorithmic art, you will find
http://www.gratin.org a fine resource. this is antoine schmitt's (paris)
links page to

algorithmic art
cybernetic art
generative art
genetic art
artificial art
interactive art
software art
=> programmed art

i visit antoine's links page from time to time and check out a few pieces.
there is work from north america amongst his links, but the majority is
perhaps from elsewhere. i take great pleasure in such a rich links page to
algorithmic art from all over the place. honestly i enjoy this links page
more than many an online publication. which isn't to denigrate online
publications but, rather, to note the value of a good links page. i think
such things are undervalued. you know we make the web. aol and google
yadayada do not do this for us. links pages are a very special part of any
site. when sites do not have a links page, i wonder if the authors are
self-absorbed. building net art consists not only in building works of net
art but the net of art.

concerning antoine's own work, i wrote something about it, if you like, at
http://turbulence.org/curators/Paris/schmittenglish.htm ; this is from a
larger project profiling the net art of six parisian net artists.

You are invited to EMBEDDED, an exhibition curated by the Center of Attention as part of frisbee (miami) at the Cavalier Hotel, 1320 Ocean Drive (between 13th and 14th), Miami Beach, December 1-4, 2005, 1 to 7pm

Art fairs are disgusting
They make us feel sick
Is this the best way to show art?
And curate art?
It is revolting

We are against it
We are for
Freeing the Tiananmen 126
Stopping dictators
Cleaning the world's water supply
Stopping child abuse
And other stuff

'...There's these two curators in bed...'

The curators of the Center of Attention
take to their hotel bed in a 'bed-in' protest
for the entire 4 days of the Miami art fairs
'Down with stuff!' they say.

we imagined the show would cover significant points
What is the curator to do for an art fair?
like the impotent protest gesture of the artist
the curator is to the art fair what the artist is to politics
expendable



We hope to see you in Miami. For further information on EMBEDDED and other frisbee participants, please visit the website: http://www.thecentreofattention.org/exhibitions/miami.html or contact Pierre/Gary at the Centre of Attention on +(44) 20 8880 5507 or on@thecentreofattention.org

With music from Providence?s
The New Nice

Curated and with an introduction by Boog City editor David Kirschenbaum

-----------

Bryson Newhart?s writing has recently appeared in Snow Monkey, Taint Magazine,
Word Riot, Muse Apprentice Guild, Reinventing the World, and Eyeshot.

Matvei Yankelevich is currently working with Eugene Ostashevsky on an Anthology
of Oberiu Writers for Northwestern Univ. Press. His translations of Daniil
Kharms have appeared in Open City and New American Writing, and are forthcoming
in The Germ. Matvei's translation of Alexander Vvedensky's The Grey Notebook was
published in the new Eastern European Poets Series from Ugly Duckling Presse,
which he edits. He is also a coeditor of 6x6, a poetry periodical. Matvei's own
poetry and prose writing has appeared in Lit, Lungfull!, Fulcrum, Raised In A
Barn, Dirigible, New York Nights, and online at Can We Have Our Ball Back,
Shampoo, 3 AM, and Aught.

The New Nice are a cello and piano duo hailing from Providence, RI who, if they
had to describe their music, would say it combines elements of Baroque,
Minimalism, and Weimar Republic-era cabaret with a New Wave pop sensibility.
Caroline Rodriguez is a classically trained pianist and singer who could read
music before she could read words. Matt Everett started his career playing
electric mandolin and whored around with many bands, from the Eyesores to Bonny
Prince Billy, before mending his ways to become the cellist and principal
songwriter and singer of The New Nice.

Readings @ The Schlafly Tap Room presents K. Curtis Lyle and Marcellus
Leonard, two great African American poets performing their work together for
the first time.

K. CURTIS LYLE



K. Curtis Lyle was born in 1944 and grew up in Watts, in South Central Los
Angeles, and was a prominent member of the seminal Watts Writers Workshop.
He came to St. Louis in the late '60s to teach at Washington University and
became connected with the Black Artists Group (BAG). Curtis's work has been
widely anthologized for decades, but the most succinct collection of his
poetry is Electric Church (Beyond Baroque Press, 2003). Also in 2003, Ikef
Records re-released "The Collected Poem for Blind Lemon Jefferson," one of
Curtis' collaborations with his dear friend, the late Julius Hemphill, of
BAG and the World Saxophone Quartet.





MARCELLUS LEONARD



Marcellus Leonard is a life long poet who writes primarily from
maturational, family and travel inspirations. He has taught creative writing
for 15 years at the University of Illinois at Springfield. He has published
three volumes of poetry: Nubian Cousins: Adventures in Verse, Cardboard
Ears: The Early Poems, and Shake The Thunder Down. Of learning to handle
difficult people you can't get away from, Marcellus says, "Ain't no point in
chopping down the tree if you have no place to ship the wood."

I like this poem a lot, Steve.  Thanks for reminding me of Elizabeth Murray's show also. I keep meaning to see it each Friday since it opened and then something always comes up that I have to do.  Will see it soon, however.  Also the Redon show at MOMA.  His work I've loved my whole life long.  Murray's work I've loved as long as I've seen it in galleries.  Anyway, I hope you saw the Redon, too.  Regards, Tom Savage

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present
a reading by
Del Ray Cross & Graham Foust
Friday, December 2, 2005 at 7:30 PM

Del Ray Cross joins us in celebration of his first full-length collection, due
out next year. He edits and publishes Shampoo, an online poetry magazine found
at www.ShampooPoetry.com, and has done so for over five years, which is also
the number of years he's been living in San Francisco. Ron Silliman called
Cross's earlier chapbook, Cinema Yosemite (Pressed Wafer, 2001), "precisely
the kind of book that gives one great hope for the future of poetry."

Graham Foust is the author of the collections Leave the Room to Itself
(Ahsahta Press, 2003) and As in Every Deafness (Flood Editions, 2004). Susan
Howe says he "has an unerring sense of the exact contours of a particular
thought and is able to express them with mathematical precision and emotional
delicacy; yet pushing against lyric constraint is wildness, uneasiness,
sometimes terror." Foust recently relocated to the Bay Area, where he is
teaching at St. Mary's College of California.


Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to SPT
members, and CCA faculty, staff, and students.

clicking on Forum in the top menu or else indirectly by clicking on:

http://www.newpoetryreview.com/forum

While membership is free, it is not automatic. Of course, we hope that
you will consider applying for membership in NPR. This is done by
clicking on Register at the top of our forum home page. We would
appreciate it if you could send us a sample of your work, either as a
poet or critic (5 poems max and/or one critical essay). Or send us a URL
to any publications online. If you qualify (and we expect that you
will), your registration will be activated. Of course, before you take
this step, we do urge you to explore the site, especially the forum, to
be sure that NPR is right for you.

New Poetry Review is a little over a year old. We have road-tested it
during this preliminary, probationary period. We currently have under 15
members but we hope to reach out to the poetic community and add many
more qualified members.

The main focus of our workshop is a discussion of each poem in depth, as
captured in our subheading: "One Poem at a Time". While we strongly
favor New Criticism, which would seem rather understandable for a site
that concentrates on "one poem at a time", other critical approaches are
welcome. Essentially, we tend to assume that any other approach, e.g.
historical, biographical, psychological, socio-political, archetypal,
etc., be based on an understanding of the poem as a poem. Thus, while
poetic technique is central to an understanding of a poem, it may be
only a springboard for a larger appreciation. However, we would like
every discussion to focus on the poem in question as its centerpiece.

In view of the serious problem of copyright, we have added special
"Private" forums for each of the forum's main sections, e.g. NPR Poems
-- Public and NPR Poems -- Private. These private forums are NOT visible
to any outsider or guest. You will see them only after you become a member.
These private forums will allow you to post poems that you wish to see
critiqued without actual publication.

For full details about NPR, please see the Guide to Newcomers under
Administrator's Corner on the forum home page.

Below is a brief summary of what NPR is and what our objectives are.

What is NPR?

Reading poetry is like digging a tunnel. The reader and the writer both
share the responsibility of meeting each other half way. The writer must
write greatly, and the reader must read greatly. Otherwise, there is no
true communication.

In my opinion, the most important and most valuable service those who
are experienced in the reading of poetry can do for others is to help
them appreciate poetry as a unique art form, that is, as something more
than mere linguistic proficiency and cultural significance. All of that
is a foundation for poetry, and no poem can come into being, consciously
or otherwise, without being nurtured by it. Yet, poetry makes special
technical as well as intellectual and emotional demands that are unique to
it. Without the language, there can be no craft, and without the craft,
there can be no art. I would like to see NPR as a forum where poets
and critics give and receive in a spirit of mutual respect and
appreciation.

In my role as Administrator, I try to insure that only qualified people
join the forum. Everyone, from novice to experienced poets, is
welcome. All that is required is some proof of a poetic sensibility and
a desire to learn and share. Like any forum, NPR cannot survive without
DIVERSITY. Poets and critics of every stripe and color, of every style
and point of view, are welcome. There is room for every kind of
discussion and every kind of literary style from the analytical to the
impressionistic to the dramatic to the aphoristic to the lyrical or
whatever is right for you. On the other hand, in my role as a member
of NPR, I am just another member and carry no more nor less weight than
any other member. You will notice that I personally tend towards the
analytical approach, but this need not be so for others. Let each
discuss poetry in their own style. Let each member gain what they can
from everyone else. If there is no diversity, we will gain nothing but
an echo of ourselves, and nobody wants that. I certainly do not.

Yet, in the final analysis, all that really matters are the poems and
our experience and appreciative understanding of them. Hopefully this
forum will help us share this understanding among discerning poets,
readers and critics. And we will engage with each poem on its own
merits, one poem at a time.

As the founder of this forum, I see my own role as a kind of matchmaker,
if you will, helping to bring together poets and critics of quality in
an atmosphere of high expectations and fruitful interaction.

If you are interested in a unique probe into New Orleans, the inveterate
poet/photo found object realist Chris Sullivan has real work there in
demolition!  The little audio recordings ("West Lake Demo", among a couple
of others) - accounting the immediate terrain - gets as close to residual
facts as I've "seen."

Hi all,

I'm writing because people are actually starting to buy stuff off the new
Combo Arts website and, to my amazement, it actually works!

Combo Arts, if you haven't heard, is the new non-profit organization which I
started after seven years of publishing Combo Magazine.  The non-profit
supports the magazine and book series as well as the Downcity Poetry Series.
We also hope to start awarding writing Fellowships for writers who could use
some extra money in order to finish worthwhile projects.

Anyway, this is all detailed on the site:

You can subscribe to the magazine, buy the first two Combo Books (K. Silem
Mohammad's A THOUSAND DEVILS and Kent Johnson, ed., ALSO WITH MY
THROAT I SHALL SWALLOW TEN THOUSAND SWORDS: ARAKI YASUSADA'S
LETTERS IN ENGLISH) and you can also make a donation (and we'll send you
Combo products in thanks).

The "About Combo Arts" button tells you what our mission is. The "Donate"
button starts you on your way to donating.  The "Purchase" buttons etc...

All transactions are done thru PayPal.

There's also a blog to read.

Have a look!

Yrs,

WHY PERSIAN LITERATURE? WHY NOW? SAADI'S 13TH CENTURY ROSE GARDEN IN TODAY'S
WORLD

Saadi of Shiraz, a contemporary of Rumi, is one of the masters of classical
Persian literature. His masterpiece, the Gulistan (Rose Garden), is revered
worldwide both for the literary pleasure it provides and for the wisdom it
contains. In the 1600s, Andre du Ryer's translation of the Gulistan into
French gave the West one of its first sympathetic windows into the world of
Islam. Subsequent translations into Dutch, Latin, German, Russian and
English spread Saadi's name and the humanistic values that are so central to
his work throughout the literary and cultural landscapes of the 18th and
19th centuries, influencing writers like Goethe, Byron, Emerson and Thoreau.
Emerson thought so highly of the Gulistan that he called it "a secular
bible." In the 20th century, a passage from the Gulistan was inscribed in
the lobby of the United Nations. Now, in the 21st century, with Iran
occupying an ever more significant place on the world stage, it is important
that we revisit that country's history and culture, reminding ourselves of
the treasures it has given the world and looking to see what we can learn
from those treasures not only about Iran and its people, but also about
ourselves.

Richard Jeffrey Newman is an essayist, poet and translator who has been
publishing his work since 1988, when the essay "His Sexuality; Her
Reproductive Rights" appeared in Changing Men magazine. Since then, his
essays and poems have appeared in Salon.com, The American Voice, The
Pedestal, Circumference, Prairie Schooner, ACM, Birmingham Poetry Reviewand
other literary journals. He has given talks and led workshops on writing
autobiographically about gender, sex and sexuality. Selections from Saadi's
Gulistan, his first book, was published in 2004 by Global Scholarly
Publications (GSP). He will be translating four more books for GSP: Saadi's
other masterpiece, the Bustan, Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, Nezami's Haft Peykar
and Attar's Elahi Nameh. His own book of poems, The Silence Of Men, is
forthcoming from CavanKerry Press. You can learn more about his work at
www.richardjnewman.com. He is an Associate Professor in the English
Department at Nassau Community College.

Dear Buffalo Listers and Others:

As many of you know Chicagopostmodernpoetry.com tries to publish two or
three Poetic Profiles (r) a month and every six months we do a Global
Profile (r) our first was of Brazil and our Second was of France (Edited by
Jennifer K Dick). Now as we reach our third year and our 150,000th unique
visit I am in need of your help to recommend poets of interest with whom I
can do poetic profiles for 2006. So if any of you have suggestions on poets
to be interviewed backchannel me with their names and I will approach them
over the next year.

Again I thank all of your for all the great support

Regards

Ray

thanks for this address, jim (http://www.gratin.org)

i went to the link for camille utterback's work & became fascinated by her
dynamic, interactive works in which viewer's movements create corresponding
movements in the programmed projection . . . see especially the quicktime
documentation of "Untitled Five" & others:

http://www.camilleutterback.com/

can you imagine this kind of work using letters & words? how cool would
that be!

& check out "text rain," one that does use letters & words interactively .
. . reminiscent of brian kim stefans' "dream life of letters" . . .
amazing! has anyone here experienced (that seems the right word) her work?

i guess i am interested in algorithmic art, even though i don't know what

such things are undervalued. you know we make the web. aol and google
yadayada do not do this for us. links pages are a very special part of any
site. when sites do not have a links page, i wonder if the authors are
self-absorbed. building net art consists not only in building works of net
art but the net of art.

concerning antoine's own work, i wrote something about it, if you like, at
http://turbulence.org/curators/Paris/schmittenglish.htm ; this is from a
larger project profiling the net art of six parisian net artists.

Dear Lori Emerson:

This is a late response, and so I won't be too
surprised if I've just plain missed it. But I just
received your e-mail, or should say retrieved, and
notice the submission deadline. I reside in Beijing,
so posting a submission to you is impossible -- in
fact might've been if I'd sent it out on the day your
e-mail first entered my inbox. Would it be possible,
I'm trying to ask, to make my last minute submission
via e-mail (understanding the this might not jive
well, as they say, will norms of your publication).
Your time and consideration will be sincerely
appreciated.

Regards,
Alex Jorgensen

Hi Camille,

Yes, "experience" is clearly an important word concerning such work. I
haven't experienced Camille Utterback's work in its particular habitat but I
have visited her site a few times. It is an unusually good site concerning
documentation of offline digital art. It does not leave one with the feeling
'sheesh take up net art and give me something other than the faintest of
echoes'. Instead, you can appreciate the concepts and make a note to see her
work if you get the chance. Utterback's work is actually quite famous in
digital art circles.

I suspect her background is in visual art, as is often the case with digital
artists. You noted the piece "Text Rain". Sometimes visual artists create
text works that are smarter about new media than writers often are (if they
can't quite escape being dominated by print paradigms). Joseph Kosuth's work
is another example of that. Not sure what Jenny Holzer's formal background
is, but I love her work with language--and her work suggests to me that she
too has a visual art background, though the writing is erm i would say
exceptionally strong.

As for what algorithmic art is, there may be subtler definitions, but I
think of it as art in which the programming is crucial to the art itself,
rather than being merely a technical aspect such as a glorified page turner.

Hey I hope your new life in Toronto is going well!!

Do you know of any poetry venues in Southern Louisiana?

Since 1995 the performance poetry group, 3 Guys from Albany (NY), has been
executing a grand plan to perform in all of the 18 Albanys in the U.S.
We've just returned from a week-long tour of the Upper Midwest which
included performing in Albany, MN, our 11th Albany, and we'd like to make
Albany, Louisiana our 12th.  We think it would be good to take our poetry
down there while they are still going through the aftermath of Katrina,
but we don't yet have personal connections in the area or know what venues
are currently active.  Albany is mostly west and a little north of New
Orleans, and a little northeast of Baton Rouge.  Typically we line up a
long-weekend or a week of gigs which includes performing in the Albany.
We'd greatly appreciate hearing from anyone with connections to possible
venues in that part of Louisiana--colleges, libraries, schools, bars,
cafes, regular open mics, slams etc....thanks.

Yours in Peace & Poetry,

Charlie Rossiter

Hey, Camille!  How are you? Where are you  now? Still in Lafayette, or have you made your way to Toronto? Hope  you're doing well!

  As for "Text Rain," I do know it; it was--may still be--installed in  the lobby of the CIT here at Brown. She gave a talk about a month ago.  I got the chance to interact with the work, but after seeing video of  people interacting with what I feel is her far superior installation,  "Liquid Time," (which, thankfully, does not involve text), "Text Rain"  was a bit of a disappointment. The lines of the poem are almost  impossible to constitute and you get, at most, one word here, another  there, that don't add up to any kind of even fragmented syntax with the  faintest of associational, semantic content. At least, it didn't for me  when I experienced it. Maybe other people had a better time with it  than I did, but I find a lot of purely visual uses of text, though  initially very interesting as ideas, mostly disappointing in the end.  It seems to me that many of these might as well have used any other  object besides letters. A bunch of letters flying at your face or  fallin
g to the
 ground or whatnot just leaves me thinking "so what?" -  and sometimes with a headache. If the point is merely to underscore the  purely material aspect of the signifier, I think this is better  accomplished in more "traditional" ways, in juxtaposition to its  signifying aspects (also and equally "material," yes?). Take the work  of one of my favorite poets, Michael Palmer, whose gorgeous lyricism  fleshes out the material nature of the signifier, its signifiance  or "signifierness," without throwing out the proverbial baby along  with. Some of Susan Howe's work does this for me, as well, in a more  visual manner. I guess, for my part, I always need the semantic element  to be present and interacting with the non-signifying, purely opaque  textual elements to give it significance, if not signification.

  I suppose "Text Rain" may be intended to do this--Camille Utterback  said in her talk that it IS important to her that the poem is there, it  isn't (intended to be) incidental--but I think this is undermined by  the logistics of how that text is reconstituted. I don't know if I  would have ever realized that there is a full, pre-written poem that is  "supposed to be" reconstituted in my interaction with the text had she  not told me. My experience of it otherwise was less than exciting. More  like, kinda fun for a bit; let's move on. All about the techno trick.  She can program. Yay. And technically, it IS quite amazing, but I'm  just not swayed by her particular use of text in that piece. Of course,  part of this might also come from having been shown the whole poem in  her presentation. Not the best.

  As a sociological experiment/performance piece, however, it's much more  interesting to me. I liked watching others interact with it, with  varying levels of self-consciousness, and interacting with others  myself as I "played" with it. It is, she said herself, all about play  (which would ideally include the semantic play of the signifier, as  well, but again, I'm not sure that's working for her). But the text  aspect seems purely incidental to me, not like in the best of  electronic writing (though not so far from some of it). I'm sure others  on the list have a much more nuanced understanding and greater  appreciation of these sorts of works than I so far do. I kept meaning  to get back and try it out again, actually, and it may be too late now.  I'll try to remember when I'm on campus tomorrow. If I have any  experience that turns my view around, I'll happily report back.

  Take care,

  Tod

Subject:      ruminating on "previously published"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

There's been discussion on this list in the past about the problem of
"previously published" as it pertains to poetry.

Good arguments have been made for both sides.

The most compelling points for me have been:

Pro: the small publisher is at (ever more) legitimate risk of being
destroyed by a copyright litigation, and, the administrative costs of
securing permissions is prohibitive. These are serious and valid
concerns, in my opinion.

Con: A good poem should have the chance to be widely circulated--in
fact, this can even be a metric of one type of quality judgment, and,
"no previously published" leads (necessarily) to "no simultaneous
submissions" which ends up being untenable when you have writers
submitting to publishers who are, after all, human and taking care in
their reading of submissions (this is the old: good/fast/inexpensive
problem. you can only ever have two of the three), and thus have slow
turnaround times. These are also serious and valid concerns.

I'm wondering, this morning--and maybe this is a stupid question that
I'm just not seeing the answer to--if the problem isn't really one of
"is it previously published?" but one of "who owns the rights?" I
think small (read: almost all) poetry publishing might be strangling
itself because it adopted some practices and some terminologies from
Big Publishing that just don't apply.

There are exceptions all around, but in broad general terms, Big
Publishing buys--practically by default--"all rights". Small
Publishing, on the other hand, more often than not buys "first time
rights," and after publication the remaining rights revert back to the
author.

In a world where the rights holder for any given previously published
piece is almost certainly Sony or AOL/Time/Warner or Microsoft Press a
policy of "no previously published" makes total sense.

But, in a world where the rights holder for any given piece is almost
certainly the author themselves, "no previously published" ceases to
make the same kind of sense.

These issues be addressed by changing "no previously published
submissions" to "previously published submissions are invited if the
author specifies that they own and are offering the reprint rights"?

Or am I missing something here?

Regards,
Dan

The Maggie Nelson whom I caught a glimpse of at  the end of the CBS television program, "48 Hours Mystery," that ~was~  the same Maggie Nelson as Maggie Nelson the poet, right?  I only  caught the last minute and at first I thought maybe I was only  imagining a likeness because of the same name, but now that I see that  our Maggie Nelson's most recent book is in fact a real life murder  story, . . .

  Did anyone see the program?

First I thought: Art is pure voyarism. We, non-artists (in a sense) look at=
 art for inspiration, answers, emotions that we can't quite reach. This is =
pure bullshit because I know nothing about art.

Then I thought: But then of what worth is the unique vision of the artist?

And then: Why is the artwork looked at as something permanent instead of so=
mething temporal, unique?

And then I thought: Why don't we feed our unique vision so that everyone ha=
s a say in what art can be?

Then: What's keeping everyone from their unique vision?

O.K., then it became: Is it laziness? Or are we seriously challenged becaus=
e art is, um, no, has become something totally alien to us (because some th=
ink it CAN be taught)?

And now I'm thinking: Like Borges writes, can we become a part of any numbe=
r of futures?

So: What's next?

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

This Friday, Nexus Foundation for Today's Art (137 N. 2nd St. Philly) will
be featuring an audio installation by Frank Sherlock & CAConrad, entitled
The B. Franklin Basement Tapes. The collaborative piece is part of the
gallery's Benjamin Franklin: an American Idol exhibit to commemorate
Franklin's 300th birthday. The show runs through January 2006, & will offer
website access to many of the works via podcast. The opening reception is
December 2, 5-9pm. We welcome you to stop by & listen. You may see our
street team on your way to Nexus, handing out fliers & hyping the project,
thus participating in the show beyond the gallery walls. (If you're
interested in rousing with the street team, please email me.) Hope to see
you there.

Frank Sherlock & CAConrad: The B. Franklin Basement Tapes

****************************

Be cupid to world government. - “Pops” Lonnie Lynn

The B. Franklin Basement Tapes is a lo-fi response to the
institutionalization of the Franklin myth. On the occasion of the 300th
birthday of this visionary rebel & sexy nerd, much will be made of Franklin
the statesman, the writer, the founder of services, and of course- the
inventor. Rather than exalting the larger-than-life creator alongside his
voluminous discoveries, we choose to take it back to the beginning. We
channel Benjamin Franklin, DIY Idea Man. Mythology has a life of its own,
establishing vertical relationships and hierarchical systems. But before
mythology, there was/is the seed. Since we've yet to discover the Franklin
Sun Recordings or Ben's Woodstock Years, The Basement Tapes document the
kinds of beginnings that propelled Franklin to rock star status. Before the
marble busts and the institutes, there were moments- as basic & genius as
re-imaginations of the present.

The project can alternately be known as The Be Franklin Basement Tapes. In
the spirit of the democratic thinker, these dream liberator exercise tapes
can be worked out in basements all over the world. The poems are
instructions to coronate our private parts. Make new musical instruments.
Develop new ways of communicating subversions. Be a douser of flames. Make
up lies & stoke revolts. This kind of urban planning & good-natured treason
requires no degrees, and no academic pedigree. Franklin stopped schooling at
age eleven and started studying margins, where all things are
visible/possible. The Basement Tapes are not an homage to The Great Genius,
but a recognition of the G-E-N-I-U-S that is not born & does not die. Today
is your birthday. Be Franklin.

ABOUT FREEDOM IN EDUCATION:
Cultural Writing. Education. Anarchism. Elizabeth Byrne Ferm=20
(1857-1944) was principal of the Modern School at Stelton, a=20
utopian-anarchist colony in New Jersey. Stating that "Education, free=20
from outer interference, would flow as normally through human life as=20
the sun, moon and stars move on their way and so fulfill their use and=20=

destiny," Ferm proposes an educative practice distinct from pedagogy,=20
one where the task of the educator is to get out of the way of the=20
self-directed child. If at first this book seems addressed only to=20
young teachers or parents, consider the first sentence: "If human life=20=

had been left free to reveal itself, there would be no need to consider=20=

the question of education."

After years of running the Neighborhood Playhouse and Workshop=20
kindergarten, Elizabeth Byrne Ferm and her husband Alexis became=20
co-principals at the Modern School of Stelton, New Jersey, the pioneer=20=

libertarian school. Assembled from Ferm=92s contributions to Stelton=92s=20=

The Modern School magazine, Freedom in Education  is a classic text in=20=

child development and anarchist theory.

The object of Mrs. Ferm=92s endeavors is to create, not a school in the=20=

ordinary sense, but a play-house in which the child can express himself=20=

and have his neighborhood experience, =93where he is free to act, but=20
also free to get the full reaction, reflection and consequence of his=20
act.=94 Her principal aim is the cultivation of initiative, of=20
self-expression, both of which are destroyed by the ordinary school=20
system. It is Mrs. Ferm=92s conviction that the best way to teach a =
child=20
is to follow the line of the child=92s own interest =85 Education, in =
Mrs.=20
Ferm=92s view, cannot be reduced to a system. It cannot be standardized.=20=

There is no method for demonstrating its efficiency. =93Every locality,=94=
=20
she says, =93must reveal its educational method in a particular, unique=20=

manner. Education is a spiritual union of unconscious youth and=20
consicious age. No degree can make an educator. The spiritual=20
development of adult life is the magnet which attracts and holds the=20
developing child.=94   =97 The Modern School, 1920

Writer Could Face Death Sentence
Freedom of expression is a dangerous concept in Afghanistan, and
could cost one man his life as well as his liberty.
By Wahidullah Amani in Kabul (ARR No. 196, 29-Nov-05)
The well-publicised case of a magazine editor jailed for blasphemy
could soon take a more ominous turn, with a state prosecutor
threatening to press for the death penalty.

Mohaqeq Nasab, editor of Huquq-e-Zan, Womenâ€™s Rights, was found
guilty of blasphemy on October 22, and sentenced to two years at hard
labour.

Nasabâ€™s offence included publishing articles that, among other
things, questioned the Islamic precept that a womenâ€™s testimony in
court carries only half as much weight as a manâ€™s, and the harsh
punishments meted out for adultery, theft and heresy.

His theoretical musings were deemed an insult to Islam, and he was
duly arrested, charged and sentenced. Now Zmarai Amiri, the
capitalâ€™s chief prosecutor, is asking a court of appeal to impose a
harsher punishment.

"The decision made by the lower court on Muhaqeq Nasab will in no way
satisfy the public prosecutor's office. The court has given him two
years imprisonment. Nasab must be punished more severely, up to and
including execution,â€ Amiri told IWPR.

Nasabâ€™s arrest has been condemned by organisations defending press
freedoms inside Afghanistan and also by international media rights
groups, such as Reporters Without Borders and the United States-based
Committee to Protect Journalists.

But those defending the embattled editor could soon find themselves
in legal difficulty, with the prosecutor threatening to arrest and
imprison anyone who springs to Nasabâ€™s defence, including members
of the governmentâ€™s own media commission.

â€œThere are some people who speak irresponsibly through television
and newspapers, without knowing anything about Islamic law, the
Afghan constitution or Afghan law. We have decided to arrest and
interrogate these people, too,â€ said Amiri.

According to the prosecutor, arrest warrants have already been
issued. On November 15, political analyst Azizullah Mamnun, who had
spoken publicly on Nasabâ€™s behalf, was detained, questioned, and
later released.

If the prosecutorâ€™s office makes good on its threats, it will have
to arrest, among others, the deputy minister of information and
culture, Sayed Ahmad Fazel Hussein Sancharaki, who serves as head of
the media commission in the ministerâ€™s absence.

"The media commission assessed all the articles published in the
magazine, and found nothing to support a charge of blasphemy,â€
Sancharaki told IWPR.

According to the deputy minister, the arrest, trial and imprisonment
were all illegal, and Nasab should be released.

â€œIn my opinion, Nasabâ€™s arrest and trial, as well as his
detention in jail, are against the media law,â€ asserted Sancharaki.

Others threatened with arrest include Rahimullah Samander, head of
Afghanistanâ€™s Independent Journalistsâ€™ Association and member of
the media commission. While Samander laughs off the threat of arrest
and imprisonment, he is deadly serious in his defence of Nasab.

â€œThe media commission is satisfied that Mohaqeq is neither an
infidel nor an apostate. He is not trying to promote depravity. It is
all a misunderstanding,â€ said Samander.

â€œWe have asked President [Hamed] Karzai to let Nasab go. If he does
not do this, then freedom of the press is being trampled underfoot in
Afghanistan.â€

One of the main points of contention is Nasabâ€™s statement that
human beings have a right to question and interpret individual
strictures of Islamic law, or Sharia.

â€œWe believe that the main sources of Sharia are Godâ€™s scripture
and human wisdom,â€ he wrote in his magazine.

Just as controversial is his assertion that there is no difference
between men and women as court witnesses. According to Islamic law,
the testimony of one man is equivalent to that of two women.

â€œThe importance in menâ€™s and womenâ€™s testimony is the same in
all fields and on all issues,â€ wrote Nasab.

But according to a fatwa or ruling issued in September by the highest
council dealing with legal matters, this statement could be
punishable by death. The Dar-ul-Ifta, the council of religious
scholars within the Supreme Court responsible for issuing fatwas on
Islamic issues, ruled that Nasab had contradicted verses of the
Koran, which is not allowed under Islam.

The punishment for apostasy is clear, according to the council, whose
fatwa quoted one of the Hadiths, a collection of writings documenting
the life and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, saying, â€œWhoever
changes or denies any verses of the Holy Koran will legitimise their
own execution.â€

But Muhammad Daud Noori, a lecturer in the department of law and
political science at Kabul University, says that Islam is not quite
as cut and dried as that on this issue.

â€œThere is no limitation on freedom of expression in Islam. Every
Muslim has the right to express his opinion," Noori told IWPR.

â€œThis kind of intolerance, where no one can give an opinion about
religion, is like Christianity in the Middle Ages. We have had a lot
of clerics, poets and intellectuals who have commented on Islamic
principles. Not only have they not been punished, they were admired
for their contributions,â€ said Noori.

According to Sancharaki, Nasabâ€™s case is evidence of judicial
anarchy in Afghanistan, â€œIf this continues, we will see other
similar cases, which will not benefit democracy or the media in this
country.â€

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Subtext continues its monthly series of experimental writing with readings
by
Rebecca BROWN, David McALEAVEY, Charles ALEXANDER at Richard Hugo House on
Wednesday, December 7, 2005.  Donations for admission will be taken at the
door
on the evening of the performance.  The reading starts at 7:30pm.

Rebecca Brown's new book _The Last Time I Saw You_ will be published by City
Lights in Jan 2006.  She is the author of _Woman In Ill Fitting Wig_, a
collaboration with painter Nancy Kiefer, and _Excerpts From A Family Medical
Dictionary_ which was recently published by Granta Books.  Other books
include
_The End of Youth_, _The Gifts of the Body_, _The Dogs: A Modern Bestiary_,
_Annie Oakley's Girl_ and _The Terrible Girls_.  She has recently written
the
libretto for _The Onion Twins_, a dancer opera created in collaboration with
Better Biscuit Dance which will have its Seattle premiere in Jan 2006.  She
teaches at Goddard College and is Creative Director of Literature at
Centrum.
She lives in Seattle.

Charles Alexander's books of poetry include _Hopeful Buildings_, _Arc of
Light/Dark Matter_, _Etudes: D & D_, _Pushing Water 1-6_, _Pushing Water 7_,
_Four Ninety Eight to Seven_, _Near or Random Acts_, and more. _Certain
Slants_,
from Junction Press, is forthcoming. He founded Black Mesa Press in 1981,
and
founded Chax Press in 1984, where he works as director, editor, publisher,
and
book artist. Alexander has taught at the University of Arizona, Pima
Community
College, and Naropa University. In the mid-1990's he was the executive
director
of Minnesota Center for Book Arts, where he organized the symposium _Art &
Language: Re-Reading the Boundless Book_, and edited the book _Talking the
Boundless Book_. Very recently, Charles Alexander won the most prestigious
award
for artists in AZ, the Arizona Arts Award:
http://www.azstarnet.com/metro/103231.

Poet Robert Creeley has written that Alexander's work "hears a complex
literacy
of literalizing words. By means of a fencing of statements, sense is found
rather than determined. The real is as thought."

Ron Silliman writes of Alexander's _Arc of Light/Dark Matter_ : "What begins
in
the eye as a paragraph becomes in the ear a line, 53 of them in fact, one
line
poems rich with news, life, war, sex, parenting, the texts at hand, the
spicing
of mulled thought, humor, bright southwestern colors, and an ear to die
for."

David McAleavey's fifth book of poems, _Huge Haiku_ was recently published
by
Chax Press.  Earlier volumes are _Sterling 403_ (1971), _The Forty Days_
(1975),
_Shrine, Shelter, Cave_ (1980), and _Holding Obsidian_ (1985), and _David
McAleavey's Greatest Hits, 1971-2000_ (2001).  He was editor and publisher
of
Ithaca House Press in the 1970s, and has been teaching at George Washington
University since 1974, where he has been director of creative writing in the
English Department since 1998.

I haven't seen the piece, as I said. But it has apparently done quite well.
It's showing at Brown six years after it was done ("Text Rain" is from
1999), for instance.

Her background is not in literature or poetry or whatever. I think doing the
sort of work with semantic content you describe, Tod, takes somebody who is
intensely involved in language. To really flesh it out. To flay and flesh,
flay, flesh. Personally, I would be interested, rather than seeing the
language fall like an easily brushed off light snow, to see it begin to
encrust the wreader. So that their flesh was corroded by the text and they
themselves were transformed into a text, suffered the fate of poetry,
suffered poetry. Though one would also want a way out of such a fate, apart
from leaving the space. Perhaps if they danced the mazurka very beautifully,
their image would not become crusty with bad poetry but would, instead, be
transformed into something rare and beautiful.

In any case, think of the space as a language space, as something radically
different from the page where the self-image is present and plastic and text
is present and as plastic, transformable. Think of it as literary media.
Serious literary media. What would it take? What would it take for it to be
serious literary media? What would it take to stir that space up into
something deeply unsettling and revelatory? Then steal the techno gear and
have at it. Or simply imagine it to the point of reality. What would it take
to create serious poetry in that space that radically departs from easy
expectations about what poetry is, that's at one with that set of media, yet
is intense in its engagement with language? What would it take to create and
destroy in that space?

These are open questions, I think. All these techno spaces are still
mysterious concerning explosive literary poetential. I don't think it's
enough to present a pre-written work of poetry; surely part of the idea is a
more dynamic conception of poetry coming into existence.

Meanwhile, in our lives, there's more and more intrusion of technology. Most
of it bereft of deep connection. Technology should extend our humanity.
Extend our sense of what it is to be human and alive and open to what is
beyond us. To take poetry forcefully into these territories with originality
and poetical significance is a challenge.

ACCIDENTAL SPECIES: A REPRODUCTION
Kass Fleisher
Literature/Innovative Writing
Chax Press

	In Kass Fleisher's wild and wonderful universe, "the traffic
was horrible and lots of people were late with their periods," or
again, the poet busies herself trying  to "express debt on a sly
chart meant to show asset retribution."  If there is a "question of
the day" for her young couples, who "naturally" refuse to share their
food, it's "who ate the oreos?  who drank the tab?"  The reader,
turning the brilliant and hilarious pages of Accidental Species,
hardly has time to come up for air before s/he is taken on yet
another verbal space shuttle, engaged in language games at once
preposterous and yet deadly in their accuracy.  If you want to know
what it's like to navigate the shoals of
intellectual-life-on-a-shoestring, as it plays out today across
mediated America, Accidental Species is the book you cannot afford to
miss. -Marjorie Perloff, author of Wittgenstein's Ladder and The
Vienna Paradox

	Imagine an evolution where each generation sets up an
expectation for the next, which in turn satisfies in ways that
couldn't be expected, and you'll get some sense Kass Fleisher's
Accidental Species.  At the level of the sentence, it evokes the
prose-poetry of Gertrude Stein; at the level of the story it is a
chimera of the personal and the public, past and present-a
defamiliarization of the pathways of mind on which men and women,
mothers and daughters, tread so leadenly, wondering why the other is
such a strange animal. At the level of the book, Accidental Species
is a stunning achievement, a constantly surprising collection that
word-by-word, sentence-by-sentence, story-by-story generates a
picture of what we are by exposing the grammars we live and
unwittingly reproduce. -Steve Tomasula, author of VAS: An Opera in
Flatland and In&Oz

	Exploring (exploding) language to uncover gender's syntax and
undo the sentencing of women to specific (and limited) roles in the
compelling narratives of marriage and family, Accidental Species is
tough-minded, brilliant, gorgeously written, completely original, and
extraordinarily freeing.  "say a poem when you can't breathe," one of
its many multilayered, contradictory voices advises -- and this is
the poem "[...this is not poetry]" to say: Fleisher's words loosen
all false stays against confusion to allow a transformative laughter
"[knot poet tree]" which opens the hope chest "[nota bene]"!
	"'N.b.:  These words are not chains binding you to any one
specific construct of hardwood forests."
	With Accidental Species, Fleisher's mother wit and creative
fury give us a "novelpoem... -- or is it poememoir," undoing knots
(and nots) to loosen breathing room in all our lives. -Laura Mullen,
author of Subject and Murmur

"A Thousand Moons Float in the Yahoo River" or "I Click Therefore I
Am?": Yi Won's Korean Buddhist Poetry of Cyber-Transmigration

A Talk by Walter K. Lew on translating and interpreting Yi Won's
cyber-writings

Thursday, December 1, 7:30,
SFU Harbour Centre, Rm. 2270
Vancouver BC
=46ree of Charge


Yi Won is a  contemporary Korean woman poet whose ruminations on
cyborgian and cyber-existence, -writing, and -thanatos extend a
tradition of Korean literary modernism in which external mirroring or
articulating devices both project and doom unfolding subjectivity. At
the same time, Yi Won's works resort to the oldest foundations of East
Asian thought, including Taoism and Buddhism, to help frame and
concretize the bewilderments that are thus encountered.

Walter K. Lew is a scholar and translator of Korean literature whose
books include the award-winning Treadwinds: Poems and Intermedia Texts
(Wesleyan U. Press), The Ga-guhm Poems (in press, Palm), and Excerpts
from: DIKTH DIKTE, for DICTEE (1982). Founder of the small press Kaya
in New York, he also edited Crazy Melon and Chinese Apple: The Poems of
=46rances Chung (Wesleyan), K=F4ri: The Beacon Anthology of Korean
American Fiction (co-editor, Heinz Insu Fenkl), the acclaimed anthology
of Asian American and Canadian poetry Premonitions, and Muae 1. Lew has
also produced TV documentaries and performed multimedia "movietelling"
pieces at film festivals in the U. S. and South Korea. He presently
teaches in the creative writing MFA program of Mills College (Oakland,
California).

Frank Wilson, Book Review Editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer, has just =
begun an interactive blog.
He hopes that enough activity on it will show the newspaper that book =
reviews deserve more space.
Wilson has always been supportive of poets, and I'm honored that he =
mentions some of my recent work.
He, in turn, has asked me to pass word of the blog around.
