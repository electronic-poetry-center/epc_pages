George, I'd ad Comix, by bpNichol, ed. Carl Peters, Talonbooks, to that.
Not ready to put my whole list together, but Stacy Doris's Conference would
be on it. And I certainly like David Bromige's As in T As in Tether.

The problem with Niedecker's books - and I am a bit of culprit here - is
that dealers know about her and put big prices because of the scarcity:
ironically I find myself "hoist with my own petard" in this respect, and
unable (or too fiscally constricted) to purchase much of hers from overseas:
but this is where good reprints come into their own...we all like signed or
inscribed first editions but but sometimes all that is wanted is a facsimile
of the book or eg Auden's "The English Auden" includes an number of his
books entire...I hate selections (although I have a number of
such)...another thing I copied a libray edition of "The Orators" as the next
edition is different (and the first is almost impossible to obtain)
(although an example here is that that book is in "The English Auyden " but
with some sligh changes, and also the very fact of a book which is AS the
FIRST seems somewhow different to a book inside or with other books..how
significant that is I''m not sure) .. hence it can be of value to see the
various editions and even the prints fonts etc used (an obvious example is
the diff. between Blake in type and facsimile's of the originals of his work
in colour (of course the original would be even better!) .....This an
advantage for people with access to the big libraries: although "down under
" things are getting better all the time in respect to availability even if
our "isolation" is still a problem, not so much as it has been in the
past....and of course "our own" literature is somewhat and more sui generis
so to speak than it has been in days of yore...

But those books (by Howe and Niedecker)  sound like new issues and are maybe
cheaper. (Hopefully the Niedecker is). The other problem for NZrs is the US$
is approx x 2 the NZ$  (however the US$ is dropping lately: and possibly it
is also versus the Australian$)...but certainly these lists are useful with
some writers I have never heard of so one day I'll beg buy borrow or steal
some ...its always harder to get this stuff in NZ...get out the violins!!
Mind you I got Nick Piombino's book for a reasonable price...Nick your not
famous enough!!

I have a another book by Susan Howe (that was a lucky find here) (I suppose
anything  (? possibly not anything of course, maybe a lot mre than is
realised)) can be ordered but people still, (myself included) tend to look
on the shelf only in eg Borders  (or here Unity Books), the Internet and The
Telephone maybe another tool in hunting down books - maye be better than the
net in some cases:....I wish I had Howe's other books entire she is an
interesting poet/writer, and I have her sister's book...also good stuff.
also Niedecker...but then I'm surrounded by unread tomes...(violins
please)....drn....

In NZ I read Alan Loney's  "The Falling" (AUP, 2001) is simultaneously a
"memoir", realtieed to NZ history (a famous rail disastor aused by a lavar)
a poem in prose and has poetry juxtaposed with poetry: Loney is a
significant and quite innovative poet, printer ,and publisher in NZ. I alos
liked greatly  Jack  Ross's "Nights With Giordano Bruno" (Bumper Books)
which is I think as interesting as anything by Howe. Also this year he (Jack
Ross) published "Chantal's Book" which I dont find (so far) so good. I
believe Wystan Curnow has published a new book also.   Wystan may know of
others but contact me re the other two books if there is any interest...if
people arei nterested in Howe or Scalapino etc then I think that Nights with
Giordano Bruno (by Jack Ross, a local poet and editor) would interest them.
John Geraets has also put out some strange and interesting books.  Thought I
would give some names from this part fo the world in the direction of the
Huge Unlistening Ear and remembering that there are some Canadians and
Australians and Others on the List....drnnn...

Happy New Year to all.

        Although an underground celebrity =96 often called the only =

        Below, a poem from the late sixties, from the volume =
_Jukeboxes_:

Good-bye tristesse, hello tristesse =96 we are in Paradise
        & the dead laugh their heads off,
I=92m returning from heaven, & can tell you all about it =96 I took
        the space train and landed in the oasis of
        American colors.
The window-washers=92 scaffolding sang, but the cold
        scissors of the carrion-man had handed themselves
        over to the cops & excited the man with dysentery and
        supermarket eyes who prints the slogans of the day
        on my sky.
Death was wearing a crime-colored n=E9glig=E9 =96 the fetuses were
        invading the external screens & the grammatical teats
        of nostalgia were pissing sulfur.
I plunged into their urban nature, this jungle of smells
        and sounds.
What world is this? Who finances it? To whom was it sold?
It was sold for a handful of coarse salt between 2 smirks and 3
        dog barks -- & the oppressed were fighting for their masters
        & their eyes were oozing under their masks of fake flesh.
(What would you be guilty of? Of everything? Of nothing? ) everybody
        winds up riffing thus in the empty streets.
Millions of you are slipping and sliding, the images slip hard by you,
        wound you or enchant you =96
The Dead have invaded Earth,
        their fingers search the loam & a pale poisoned fog hangs
        over Wall Street.
Oh Manhattan, Island devoured  by grief, Indian island where today the
        Images print out the Journal of Shame & Fear.
The skin flicks are full up =96 Get out of this bronze forest! Drop=20
everything!
        Heat up the glue! Don=92t run over the blacks! Don=92t step on =
the Indians!
        Don=92t let the words settle in! Don=92t let the children croak =
in the
        Supermarket-bunker!
The comic strips & the advertisements stumble over  the film stock of
        your asses,
a distant air of burning scorpions peels off the rotten trunk
of History =96
For us the adversary is Death, Money, Hate & War (Death & all the old
        clich=E9s & all the horrible death rattles).
One wake sup in another world with a bad taste between  the legs.
It=92s over. The show=92s over and done with. The slave words are
        being noisy in the service staircase, like the fascist foam
        on the airwaves.
A return to the past so as not to bother anybody =96 a jungle of =
curtains
        =96 light years that stutter,
imaged crowds stuffing themselves with cosmic shot =96 a trigger=92s
        already thought too quickly =96 Goodbye sadness, hello =
tristesse.

Following up on RT's point. ..

Another big problem I have noticed - I don't know if this is lately or not -
is that the poetry journals that have the hottest stuff in them are being
shelved in my local university (UC Berkeley) at a location where it is HARD
AS HELL to get at them. First you have to sign an application form to get
into the room where they are housed, then you must fill out a request form
to see a specific issue, then usually you must wait a full day if the item
is in storage (which it usually is), then you fill out ANOTHER form if you
want to photocopy a few pages (at premium prices), then you wait another
full day for the photocopy work to get done (which in one case with me was
not done because the request was inadvertently mislaid, entailing another 3
days of waiting!), etc. By the time you receive what you want, you are so
disgusted by the process that you almost don't even want to read it anymore!

Why aren't new poetry journals being made accessible so that young students
can read and be inspired by them, instead of being locked away like precious
jewels? Can somebody in academia answer me this? At the very least, the
university should provide a cheap photocopy on the open stacks for the
general reader. Eh, it makes me sick!

And this doesn't simply pertain merely to old stuff from the 20s either.
This applies to journals from the 80s and 90s, like Poetics, o-blek, etc.
Stuff that really ain't all that rare. I see it at library sales and in
bargain bins all the time.

I've had quite a few queries backchannel re the Susan Howe titles, so
I'm posting the info to the list.

The two books I mentioned are quite pricy.
They're quite pricy -- Bedhangings 2 as I recall was ten or maybe
fifteen pounds; Kidnapped (300 copies hardbound, numbered and signed) is
35 pounds -- British money, that is, plus postage. I don't know what the
exchanage rate is on the U.S. $ -- around $1.50 I'd guess. Irish punts
might be more, less, or the same.

Coracle Press: Coracle, Ballybeg, Grange, Clonmel, Tipperary, Ireland. I
don 't know the e-mail, or even if there is one.

I bought my copies from Alan Halsey, West House Books, 40 Crescent Road,
Nether Edge, Sheffield S7 1HN, England -- e-mail
alan@nethedge.demon.co.uk
He may have a few coies left, but I don't know.
They might also be available from Peter Riley Books, 27 Sturton Street,
Cambridge, CB1 2QG, England, e-mail Priley@dircon.co.uk

Niedeecker's New Goose, edited by Jenny Penberthy, prints all 86 of the
New Goose poems from the manuscript -- full editorial apparatus is to be
fouind in Penberthy's edition of Niedecker's Collected Works (California
UP).  Cost U.S.$10.00. Published by Listening Chamber,1605 Berkeley Way,
Berkeley, CA 94703.  No doubt also available from SPD.

========

The other good book that I want to mention from 2002 is actually a
shameless plug, since I am married to one of the writers and therefore
not exactly unprejudiced so far as its considerable and skilful charms
are concerned: Wanders, by Robin Blaser and Meredith Quartermain.
Available from the publisher, Nomados, P.O. Box 4031, 349 West Georgia
Street, Vancouver B.C., Canada V6B 3Z4 for U.S.$10.00 plus U.S.$2.50
postage.

And (perhaps foolishly assuming one might be possible) a very good new
year to one and all...

'Writing Machines'
N Katherine Hayles
A Mediawork Pamphlet
MIT Press 2002
ISBN 0-262-58215-5

This 'pamphlet' surprises you immediately, it is a black-covered hardback=20
with a lovely feel and design that says this book is different from other=20
books. Pages of shiny paper (you can't write on them) and blocks of text=20
that zoom out at you, or that are printed right up to the page edges,=20
secret inscriptions, screen shots and new terminology introduced as=20
underlined CAPITALS. The outside of the book reflects what the inside of=20
the book is saying, before you even read a word. Hayles contends that the=20
materiality of the work is important to the experience of it and that works=
=20
in different media require their own media specific analysis (MSA).

The 'I' that writes is never the 'I' that is written and so N Katherine=20
Hayles chooses a character 'Kaye' to tell of her journey of discovery from=
=20
childhood to the present. However in doing so it was more than a little=20
reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland as the na=EFve young Kaye skipped through=
=20
science and art and arrived at electronic textuality. And when she arrived=
=20
at this wonderland she found that all she had thought of her world had been=
=20
turned upside down.

"Lulled into somnolence by five hundred years of print, literary studies=20
have been slow to wake up to the importance of MSA. Literary criticism and=
=20
theory are shot through with unrecognized assumptions specific to print.=20
Only now, as the new medium of electronic textuality vibrantly asserts its=
=20
presence, are these assumptions clearly coming into view." (pp 29-30)

But I am not convinced about the importance Hayles places on the=20
materiality of works of literature. I think Hayles, and nearly every other=
=20
student of literature over the last fifty years received a very narrow=20
education as to what constitutes a literary work, a very rigid=20
print-centric view. Digital texts have made her realize that a work can=20
have other representations. Young Kaye skips backwards to see what in the=20
past she overlooked, and sees that the materiality of print was there all=20
along. She concludes that a media specific analysis of works is required,=20
so that the inscription technology is taken into account in the=20
interpretation of the work.

In a past persona of  'komninos the  professional spoken word performance=20
poet', I was fully aware of the prejudice that exists within the academy=20
which privileges print over all other material actualizations of poetry.=20
Personally I think if a work gives me a poetic experience then it is a poem=
=20
irrespective of the presentation/distribution medium. For me poetry is an=20
immaterial thing, a virtual thing (virtual in the Deleuzian sense) an=20
unsolvable problematic with many actualizations in many different media.

Anyway this is a good introduction for print-centric lovers of literature=20
to the possibilities of books beyond what we traditionally think of as=20
books. It is also a great way of introducing computer-phoebes and sceptics=
=20
to the mixed semiotic systems that constitute the literary experience in=20
media other than in print. N Katherine Hayles has been one of the earliest=
=20
and most active supporters of digital literatures or 'technotexts' as she=20
calls them, and in sharing her discoveries through a fantasy and honestly=20
through her persona Kaye, she makes the transition a little easier for=20
others who want to understand.

"Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would,=
=20
in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep,=20
through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood:=
=20
and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their=20
eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream=
=20
of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple=20
sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own=
=20
child-life, and the happy summer days." Lewis Carroll, Alice's Adventures=20
in Wonderland.

Subject: Claude Pélieu (1934-2002)


Claude Pélieu – poet, collagist, translator – died December 24 in
Norwich, NY where he had been living with his wife, the painter and
translator Mary Beach for some years. Born in Pointoise near Paris in
1934, Pélieu moved to the US with Mary Beach in 1963, first to San
Francisco where he was involved with City Lights Books (which also
published his first writings), then in the late sixties to New York
where he lived, first in NYC, later on upstate, except for a few years
in England in the early seventies and a short return to France in
1994/1995.
        In 1952, at 17, he published a first book of poems, Rendez-vous avec
le sol, clearly inspired by Surrealism. At the same time he was already
deeply involved in painting and collage work, and shows political
affinities with the Situationists. Later in that decade he is drafted
into the army and after harrowing experiences in the Algerian war that
would mark him for life, he was released after having been wounded.
        Though he never stopped doing collage work, writing began to take
precedence, especially after he and Mary Beach moved to San Francisco
in 1963. The sixties and seventies will see a formidable push by the
Pélieu/Beach team who translate the major texts of the beat generation
into French, including the core works of Bob Kaufman, Allen Ginsberg
and William Burroughs, as well as books by Edward Sanders, Hart Leroi
Bibbs, Timothy Leary, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Alden Van Buskirk and
others. During the same years Pélieu publishes a dozen or so books of
his own writing, from poetry to prose journals.  During the eighties
and nineties the writing slows down and the visual work begins to take
precedence again – he will produce several thousand collages of all
sizes during that period, on occasion collaborating with Mary Beach.
        Among his most important works are _Opal USA_ (Beach Books, texts &
Documents), _Automatic Pilot_ (Fuck You Press / City Lights), _Le
Journal Blanc du Hasard_ (Christian Bourgois, 1969), _Ce que dit la
Bouche d’Ombre dans le bronze-étoile d’une tête_ and _Infra-Noir_ (Le
Soleil Noir, 1969 & 1972), _Juke-Boxes_ (10/18, 1972), _Kali Yug
Express_ (Christian Bourgois, 1974), _La Rue est un Rêve_ (Ecrits des
Forges, 1989), and _Studio Réalité_ (Le Castor Astral, 1999).
        Although an underground celebrity – often called the only original
French Beat – in his country of origin, his work is less known here in
the US, no doubt because relatively little of it has been translated
into English and most of that has been out of print for some years now.
        Below, a poem from the late sixties, from the volume _Jukeboxes_:

Good-bye tristesse, hello tristesse – we are in Paradise
        & the dead laugh their heads off,
I’m returning from heaven, & can tell you all about it – I took
        the space train and landed in the oasis of
        American colors.
The window-washers’ scaffolding sang, but the cold
        scissors of the carrion-man had handed themselves
        over to the cops & excited the man with dysentery and
        supermarket eyes who prints the slogans of the day
        on my sky.
Death was wearing a crime-colored négligé – the fetuses were
        invading the external screens & the grammatical teats
        of nostalgia were pissing sulfur.
I plunged into their urban nature, this jungle of smells
        and sounds.
What world is this? Who finances it? To whom was it sold?
It was sold for a handful of coarse salt between 2 smirks and 3
        dog barks -- & the oppressed were fighting for their masters
        & their eyes were oozing under their masks of fake flesh.
(What would you be guilty of? Of everything? Of nothing? ) everybody
        winds up riffing thus in the empty streets.
Millions of you are slipping and sliding, the images slip hard by you,
        wound you or enchant you –
The Dead have invaded Earth,
        their fingers search the loam & a pale poisoned fog hangs
        over Wall Street.
Oh Manhattan, Island devoured  by grief, Indian island where today the
        Images print out the Journal of Shame & Fear.
The skin flicks are full up – Get out of this bronze forest! Drop
everything!
        Heat up the glue! Don’t run over the blacks! Don’t step on the
Indians!
        Don’t let the words settle in! Don’t let the children croak in the
        Supermarket-bunker!
The comic strips & the advertisements stumble over  the film stock of
        your asses,
a distant air of burning scorpions peels off the rotten trunk
of History –
For us the adversary is Death, Money, Hate & War (Death & all the old
        clichés & all the horrible death rattles).
One wake sup in another world with a bad taste between  the legs.
It’s over. The show’s over and done with. The slave words are
        being noisy in the service staircase, like the fascist foam
        on the airwaves.
A return to the past so as not to bother anybody – a jungle of curtains
        – light years that stutter,
imaged crowds stuffing themselves with cosmic shot – a trigger’s
        already thought too quickly – Goodbye sadness, hello tristesse.

contexts. Tonight I read at the Drawing Center where I was supposed to go
hear a reading of Bill Luoma, Juliana Spahr and Dorothy Lusk on the evening
of September 11th. That was one of the turning points for me that day- when
I realized that the event was so big the poetry church of the evening
wouldn't be happening. I heard Dottie took a Grayhound all the way from
Vancouver to read and then hid out in the Chelsea Hotel with her daughter-
now that's a performance! I sang a a few of my rewritten ballad/hymn pieces
in a post-modern poetic context (with Christian Bok and Ben Marcus, curated
by Lytle Shaw) surrounded by the spirit and gift drawings of the Shakers."
(Lee Ann Brown); "I was interested in getting beyond the generic jazz and
poetry sound- musicians noodling nonchalantly behind fairly transparent
verse..." (Nathaniel Mackey) "Not wishing to construct another binary that
can be read as funded/unfunded, official/unofficial and so on, we might look
for a third example, a dedicated space for readings such as the Voice Box in
London's South Bank Arts complex, adjoining onto the box theatre. It has a
minimal decor and all focus is onto the reader at the rostrum. About 10
years ago I had the curious experience of presenting a set of Jackson Mac
Low's 'The Pronouns' there with a group of young 'new dance'
choreographers."(Chris Cheek) For more information write to David Kennedy

Jeff Hull, "Spoor" Subpress, "These truths we hold to be self-evident:
disclosure is moot since the piper got hold of our social security numbers,
aggressivity really can't be hypoallergenic, and transparency attracts bad
faith as much as people need acknowledgement. At the same time,
individualism necessitates layers of antibiotic strategy, and the
undisturbed trope is as antiquated as the contention that global
exploitation is somehow responsible for car-bombings." (From one of his
intros at the Ear Inn Series)  For info write to orders@spdbooks.org

An E-Chapbook of Poems By Luis H. Francia
Site Address: http://www.meritagepress.com/babaylanpubs.htm
Release Date: January 2003

Meritage Press is pleased to announce the publication of an e-chapbook=20

selections from a larger manuscript entitled A Museum of Absences. This=20

journals and anthologies.

The cover offers a luminous photograph, Baro, by the Manila photographer Nea=
l=20
Oshima.

Mr. Francia describes how the manuscript developed: "A Museum of Absences=20
began almost four ago, as a compilation of 1990s work, much of which dealt=20
with absence and invisibility, whether personal, historical, or metaphorical=
,=20
and the attendant world of loss and longing. Then the twin towers of=20
Babel/New York collapsed. The horrific events of September 11, 2001 propelle=
d=20
me to write quite a number of poems on the tragedy, directly and indirectly.=
=20
Many of these make up the bulk of the selections here."

A Manile=C3=B1o and a New Yorker, Luis H. Francia won the Philippines' Palan=
ca=20
Memorial Award for Poetry, First Prize, in 1978. His previous books of poetr=
y=20
are 1979's Her Beauty Likes Me Well (a two-poet collection, the other poet=20
being David Friedman), and 1992's The Arctic Archipelago and Other Poems. Hi=
s=20
2001 semiautobiographical Eye of the Fish: A Personal Archipelago (Kaya, NY)=
=20
won both the 2002 PEN Open Book and the Asian American Writers Workshop=20
literary awards.=20

He has published a collection of essays and reviews, Memories of=20
Overdevelopment (1998), and edited two literary anthologies: Brown River,=20
White Ocean: Twentieth Century Philippine Literature in English (1993), and=20
Flippin': Filipinos on America (co-edited with Eric Gamalinda, 1996). He=20
co-edited, with media artist Angel Velasco Shaw, an anthology on the=20
Philippine-American War, Vestiges of War: The Philippine-American War and th=
e=20
Aftermath of an Imperial Dream, 1899-1999 (2002). His works--both poetry and=
=20
nonfiction--have appeared in anthologies, journals, magazines, and=20
newspapers, in New York, San Francisco, Honolulu, Manila, Baguio, Hong Kong,=
=20
Singapore, Madrid, and New Delhi. He has taught at Sarah Lawrence College an=
d=20
now teaches at New York University. He writes a column for The Sunday=20
Inquirer Magazine in Manila and for The Village Voice in New York.=20

That problem doesnt happen at the Auck University Library so much except for
certain New Zealand materials and some mags. but  most stuff is there and
there is a lot of Am Poetry as well as journals [never enough of course but
that's always the case in life!] I think partly thanks to the staff in the
English Dept.  There are parallel problems however: it is a problem actually
obtaining certain mags - but not usually once they are in the library or
shop -  maybe the range of journals is is not as wide as it might be but
that's always the case. The other problem is the cost of enrolling (or even
joining the library as a graduate)....and that is a political issue as NZ
has moved to a kind of "every man and woman for himself" system under
Rogernomics and oter right wing politics and related since 1985.

There are a lot of well to do students and fewer "working class" students
and thousands of students from Asia who are studying Sciences, Computers,
and Commerce....however still enough are in the Humanities  - but these are
always under threat because of right wing or "pragmatic" policies....

To MWP  I feel also that you should raise this issue with the ":powers that
be" ..go to the chief librarian - insist on seeing him/her and putting your
case (documents also with you if necessary) as what is a happenning to you
is intolerable  - it may not be so bueracratically insane at other Uni's in
the States ...I'm assuming you are in the States or Canada and I suppsoe
there could be a big range of experiences/rules depending where you are....

You might find they will change things as they are adhering to some stupid
rules that nobody is aware of are stupid - dont discuss it with any one
except those who can change anything though as the others are gnerally
totally uninterested and are "just following orders"...which attitude is
fair enough to a point if you consider the way such places are organised
...but the person's in charge who CAN change things may well do something.

I used to read at the Auck Uni library and read the many many letters to the
Chief librarian and some were humorously responded to, some were rebutted or
turned back on the  "complainer", but a lot were acted upon: it was
fascinating to read the letters...some were very funny....there's an idea
for a poem/story:    "Letters to the Chief Librarian" !

Cheers, Richard

The legend of Spider-girl cuts a wide swathe across
both urban and tribal mythologies. In fact, hers is
the only such story I know of; one that has both
survived and thrived in the shopping mall as well as
the sweatlodge.
        Pop culture embraced Spider-girl as well, but,
uncomfortable at the time with the idea of a powerful
female, she was given a gender makeover, and the more
sinister aspects of her story (she was, after all,
modeled on a carnivorous arachnid) were jettisoned in
favor of a "good-samaritan-with-radioactive-powers"
motif.
        The truth is, Spider-girl the universal archetype
stands as a more complex figure than American comic
books would have us believe. To the Jivaro and the
Navajo, she was both destructive seductress and
bountiful fertility; she roamed the outskirts of
villages, ensnaring unfaithful men and drinking their
souls, while also protecting the community's harvest
against pestilence.  To the Crow and the Sioux, she
was both the famine that accompanied surges in
population and a sign of good fortune in times of war;
a warrior visited by Spider-girl the night before
battle was assured victory, being able to fight as if
he had eight arms and eight eyes.
        One of the urban legends regarding Spider-girl
unfolds as follows:
        At  a club in the heated down-town of any
metropolitan city on any given weekend night, a young
man notices a stunning young woman lingering alone
along the walls. The lipstick this stunning young
woman wears is a panic red, a red that hangs sullen
and  electric in the air behind her as she walks. He
approaches and offers to buy her a drink. The tone of
her lipstick squeezes something secret and tropical
from his conciousness.
        After persuading her to come home with him at the end
of the night, the potential lovers leave the club and
head for the young man's apartment. He drives with the
top down, the city a charcoal smudge glittering and
tunneling around them. She sits quietly in his
peripheral vision (the quiet ones have always turned
him on), and at times he would swear he sees threads
of smoke billow from her, twisting behind the car and
disappearing into the rush of the city behind them.
        When they arrive at the young man's apartment, things
become hazy and confused. The woman moves quickly, too
quickly for the young man, and it seems to him that
everything in the apartment is shifting. Soon the
young man loses conciousness, and falls into a
restless sleep.
        The next morning, quite late, he opens his eyes. At
first his bedroom seems buried in swathes of
translucent smoke; he can see the angles of the
dresser in front of him, but they've softened, faded:
the whole apartment has been submerged in what seems
to be an Impressionist painting. Upon closer
inspection (and some waning of the dry blue hangover
wracking his cells), the young man comes to the
realization that not only is his lovely partner of the
night before missing, but it would also seem that his
apartment has been coated in what looks suspiciously
like the orphan threads of cotton balls.  His
furniture fairly glistens under a film of soft fluff;
his prize collection of CDs sticks together, tied up
in cloud-stuff. And if that weren't enough, cutting
through the near-erasure, an incredibly, nauseously
lurid lipstick spells cryptic phrases on his
steamed-up bathroom mirror: "3-3-3-3-3-3" and, below
it, "STOP ON RED".
        Not long after this our young man stops at a gas
station on his way to yet another club. The mystery of
the young woman who left his apartment a cloudy
shambles has subsided; all that remains of it is a
drive to find more young women, bring them back home,
wake up with them: the ritual in its proper form. In
the gas station, paying for his fuel, the young man
buys three candy bars, three packs of cigarettes and
three packages of condoms; just before he concludes
his transaction, he pauses, decides to test his luck;
with an odd dollar he plays the lottery,rattling off a
number he barely thinks of. The clerk is sullen, and
greasy.
        He has no luck at the club. None of the girls
swimming in lasers and strobes and smoke-machine
mystery tug him anywhere above his belt.  They pull
weakly; they smell too sweet. He's back in his car by
a quarter to eleven.
        The DJ sounds far too frenetic for our young man's
morose mood, but he listens anyway, hoping the jolt of
an electrified voice will shock his doldrums away.
There's almost no traffic; with the windows down, he
believes he can hear both the DJ and the sound of the
car echoing against the biildings. The DJ reads the
lottery numbers, and for a minute it doesn't register.
He approaches the intersection.
        "Holy SHIT!" He can't think to punch the brake.
        Squeal. Thud. Crack.

Months drift by. Years come to an end.

The bounty of demonstrations, resources and ideas exchanged at the annual
meeting of the COCH/COSH meeting at the end of May 2002 may perhaps excuse
my providing a late sampling of the rich offerings examined at that spring
gathering.

http://web.mala.bc.ca/siemensr/C-C/2002/Program.htm


It is a selective sampling from four days of presentations devoted to
Humanities Computing and Emerging Mind Technologies. I'm never quite sure
how to parse that last bit: whether it is the technologies that are
emerging or the mind or both (in some proposed sequence). Parsing is one
way of threading two related groups of sessions: the one clustered around
the model of games and the other around the boundaries of perceivable
structure (that's my translation of some of the concerns raised in the
information aesthetics stream.

Marshall Soules through Computer Gaming and Protocols of Improvisation
offered a very suggestive presentation on "the voluntary discipline
required of improvised performance" Andrew Mactavish, the organiser of the
theorizing computer games sessions, nicely paired Soules's concerns with
performance as a procedural method with a paper presented by Patrick Finn,
Half-Life, Full Theory: Formalizing Video Criticism, where the audience
was quick to replay a familiar boundary question (user/coder) along the
lines of player/maker.  The discussion raised interesting epistemological
questions: just how far do researchers need to position themselves as
participant-observers in and around the discursive communities they
investigate? what authority does the non-expert have to formulate
hypotheses and interpretations about the behaviours of expert or
specialist groupings?

The ideological dimensions of games were an overt theme of the other
session devoted to social and cultural frameworks of theorizing computer
games. James Campbell problematized any easy answers in the examples he
presented in examining Computer Games as Complicitous Critique of Global
Capitalism. Gendered-perspectives offered by Carolyn Guertin and Aimee
Morrison with respectively From Complicity to Interactivity: Theories of
Feminist Game Play and Nerds Heroic and Social: Cinematic Video-gaming and
the Domestication of Computing led a consideration by those in attendance
of a distinction reminiscent of the literary criticism of Northrop Frye
(inspired perhaps by coincidence/remembrance that this part of the
COSH-COCH proceedings being held on the premises of Victoria College where
Frye taught). I cannot help but thinking that the matrix vs maze
distinction that emerged needs to be mapped onto the
procedural/declarative types of
languages. The maze was identified as the spatial pattern that suited the
directed quest. The matrix holds out other possibilities of movement and
brings the notion of game closer to Soules's considerations of
improvization.

Theorizing games can become rather giddying much like the engagement with
actual play -- just as pleasurable and cognitive challenging as the
aesthetics of codework which exposes the "generative material substrate"
of cultural-textual productions in their digital incarnations. Something
like a return of materialist-structuralist film making. The presentations
of Talan Memmott and Alan Sondheim (especially Sondheim's) demonstrated
the limits of de-cuing expectations. The currently accessible technology
allows for greater ease of shuffling images than sounds. Simply closing
one's eyes during an information overload session that is screen-centred
helps pace the cognitive apparatus. So does mediation. By happy
circumstance Maria Damon one of the organizers of the session read Rita
Raley's paper, The Object as Code. It was an interesting exercise in what
may be akin to sight-reading a score. A paper read in absentia of the
author gives the audience a sense of what carries.  Together, these
i-provizations, indicate how difficult it is to turn off sense making ---
there always seems to be a pattern to frame the noise.

I missed the other Information Aesthetics session. And it is too bad that
one of the presenters there missed the Sondheim, Memmott,
Raley-read-by-Damon pieces.

With a title offering an intertextual parody of Hayles's "posthuman" buzz
word, How We Became Automatic Poetry Generators, Katherine Parrish,
drew me in to discover some deliciously crafty MOOwerk
http://www.meadow4.com/moolipo  Unfortunately, I missed the panel &
discussion.  Any subscribers in attendance care to report, rift or
improvise?

Parrish entices exploration.  I think she is wrong in invoking: <cite>
In How We Became Posthuman, N. Katherine Hayles asserts that pattern and
randomness are bound together in "a complex dialectic that makes them not
so much opposites as complements or supplements to one another" (Hayles
25).
                      The relationship between authorial control and its
relinquishment as it is realized in textual production involving random
procedures is  characterized by a similar supplementarity. Operating in
this splice, these procedures point to an emergent posthuman subjective
agency. <cite>


Post human? I wonder if any distinctions was made during the discussion
period to indicated the possibility that the procedures are not random,
the selection of the next procedure might be.

Loop back to Aimee Morrison who inspired me to go off and read Charles
Bernstein's essay, Play It Again, Pac-Man (collected in A Poetics), In the
subsection entitle "The Computer Unconscious" Bernstein invites readers to
contemplate the statement that "[t]he experiential basis of the
computer-as-medium is _prediction and control_ of a limited set of
variables. The fascination with all computer technology [...] is figuring
out all the permutations of a limited set of variables."

And so circling round the interplay between games and digital
performances/deconstructions, one can generate the sequence:

improvizaton --- i-provization --- hyperprovization

In Bernstein's discursive context, the military-industrial complex origins
of computer the aim is prediction and control. (This seems to hunt
Hayles). However the two activities may need to be separated out. The
aesthetic pleasure of figuring out the permutations may just complexify
notions of control. From there it is just a friendly disciplinary boundary
hop to cognitive psychology and the concerns of embodied knowing and
digital representations (a topos of many a post to Humanist).

Carolyn Guertin and Andrew Mactavish organizers of some very stimulating
sessions are to be thanked for some fine planning -- providing for some
hyper-improvisations worthy humanist scrutiny and ecoute.

thanks for passing this along, alan- i'm surprised lachance or mcCarty
didn't post this to the coch/cosh list (or mebbe the did and i got bumped
cause i'm behind in my membership dues!). funny how words get around these
days.

it was indeed a rich conference, and i'm sorry i didn't get to take in more
of it.. although i _was_ at the afternoon panel- as were all of the
presenters from the morning session ( so i'm not sure what that reference is
about)- it was hard enough to make it to our own session, given the massive
hangovers we were sporting from the night before from one of the  "special
edition" lexiconjury's. actually, quite a number of poetry types attended
that early morning session, which was really as we thought we'd be
presenting to each other- which would have been alright as well.


anyhow, the paper i presented is available here,
http://www.meadow4.com/papers/IinError.html
under a different title.. and a modified version has found a publication
home, but feedback is welcome, as i think there is still time to tweak.

i'll probably drop lachance a note myself as i'm not clear on the
distinction he wishes to make... heck, we could even go for coffee being all
in each other's backyard's and everything.

I like listservs because
   I don't have to go to them, they come to me
   there's an immediacy about them - oh no, I've just made a complete arse of
   myself and now most of the world knows about it. sort of thing.
   Weblogs can be, well, "pre-meditated".
   I've gotten control of my email addiction but this is being replaced, to my
   horror, by web-surfing.  Particularly weblogs, which have the annoying knack
   of rolling-over content, so I have to look just in case anything new has
   arisen in the past, oh, 2 seconds or so.

"I am struck by the intellectual verve - its complex sense of the
architecture of the poem as it responds to diverse literary traditions. Thi=
s
long poem creates rooms of and room for playfulness, humour, political
anger, and aesthetic pleasures. It isn't static; it moves; it reads itself
and interrogates.
=8BCarla Harryman

"Rachel Levitsky brilliantly designs mysterious flying objects of language
and of desire, as she succeeds in giving each word an intriguing span of
life.  Her poems are theater, teaser, solution, entretien de tension which
keep meaning and its boundaries open for intimate manuvres of reading."
=8BNicole Brossard

"Under the Sun operates on the small stages of intimate conflict and
longing, but casts light outside the ring: we see the shadows of the crowd,
we smell the dirty water that slaps against the piers. It's a formulation
and un-doing of the personal. Intimacy excavated yields characters, ironic
and adrift, who quiver in the jackets of their names. We know them by
contact, or contract, an occupation of looks and resistance. The poem enact=
s
the force of situated desire. Under the Sun is brilliant wit wrenching
poetics: a word stream taking its shirt off."
=8BCamille Roy=20

kick against restraints and patina rust

waiting on the food chain to trickle down

write thank you notes for orgasms that
weren't yours.  dodge diving satellite

as it reenters life.  it's all abt you

not Peking duck or moths cupped
gently in hands.  maybe a splinter would

    remind, toke of neon and hold it,

    exclaim across vast stretches of
    void that we celebrate and be

    to protect, avenge the few

senile rivers are being dredged for bile
yes, zombies bop in Starbucks w/ burnt tongues

The Night Before Christmas 2002

  'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the land, not a
critic was stirring, for stirring was banned. A thousand brown
prisoners, snug in their cells, all held without charges or tinsel or
bells;
  and mamma was wrapped in the national flag,
  while we sang ".Where there's never a boast or a brag."
  When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
  I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
  Away to the TV I flew like a flash;
I then watched "Survivor" and reruns of "Mash."
The fireworks, exploding above the new snow,
gave a luster of objects to people below.
When what saw my wondering eyes in the flashes:
a miniature George Bush and eight tiny fascists!
Their jerseys were blue and said "WORLD DOMINATION";
I knew right away this was not just claymation.
More rapid than eagles the warlords they came,
as the little Bush whistled and called them by name:
"Now, Daschle! now, Ashcroft! Now Strom, don't relent! On,
Poindexter, Rumsfeld! on Henry and Trent
To the top of the globe, while the crowd's at the mall,
now bomb away, bomb away, bomb away all!"
  His sack had a war game for each girl and boy;
his pocket, four billion from just Illinois.
  Far up on his high seat the driver did mount,
with more massive weapons than Kofi could count.
  And then, I heard sounds from away off somewhere,
the booming of bombs that were bursting in air.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
own the chimney old Dick Cheney came with a bound.
He said not a word, nor disclosed his location;
he wiretapped my house in the name of the nation.
Then holding the strings of his little Bush puppet,
he went to the chimney and quickly rose up it.
The sleigh was still running, but Dick didn't hurry;
gas guzzlers, it seemed, were no longer a worry.
He popped the champagne and exclaimed as he served it,
"The world is now ours, and GOD DAMN, we deserve it!"

Dear family,

(I know you all so well, I hope you won't mind me calling you family--)

I'm happy to announce that there is a picture of me, stumbling out of the
Nuyorican, on page 99 of the current Seventeen (Feb '03).  And the girl in the
Windsor top, Aldo boots, and Necessary Objects skirt, clutching my left arm--- I
*think* it's Arielle Greenberg. Frankly I was too drunk to pay her much
attention that night.

I do remember that I had washed my hair with Herbal Essences Fruit Fusions
shampoo.

Happy new year!

Aaron

Subject:      Re: Interesting books of 2002?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Maybe I'm reading the question too literally and personally, but to me, the
most interesting books of 2002 involved film in non-US cultures, cuz I'm
particularly interested in film in non-US cultures. Plus, most of the books
I really loved in 2002 are actually 2003 titles.

Anyway, here are my personal "most interesting":

_Treadwinds_, Walter K. Lew: which includes a wonderful piece, "The Pyonsa's
Complaint." A pyonsa is a "movieteller"--e.g., someone who provided live
narration and sound effects for silent films in Korea. I won't write about
it here cuz I'm probably gonna blog about the whole book later.

_Cinema of Interruptions: Action Genres in Contemporary Indian Cinema_, by
Lalitha Gopalan

and

_Bollywood Cinema: Temples of Desire_, by Vijay Mishra

Both of the above books are a bit tough going in places, especially the
latter one--not only are they fairly academic, but assume you've been
immersed in Indian film culture for a long time, which is not true in my
case. But, even still, they've both been great companions to all of the
Bollywood movies on tape & at the Eagle that Nada & I've been watching
recently. I'll probably blog about these as well, so will shut up now.

Coracle Press is run by Simon Cutts and his wife, the American artist, Erica VanHorn. Simon Cutts's poetry is rather marvelous, in fact, one book i failed to mention in my list of favorite books of 2002 was his new book THE SMELL OF PRINTING, Selected Poems 1988-1998.  it's a GREAT book put out by Granary Books.  although, now that i think about it, it didn't come out in 2002, but 2001.

another of my favorite Simon Cutts books is "See Pages" and then the beautiful Jargon book PIANOSTOOL FOOTNOTES.

Cutts is one of those overlooked geniuses of our time.  i wanted to mention his books, since mention of his press Coracle was coming up.  you won't regret the small effort of finding his books.  in fact, if you want, interlibrary loan can find just about every Simon Cutts book ever printed.

Cutts had some very interesting poems based on old refrigerator repair manuals from the 1950's, these were published in an anthology of British and American avant guard poetry called MAD COW.

My daughter Clio and I just had coffee (Clio had juice) with Mike Magee who
gave me issues 2, 4, 6-11 of COMBO, so I've been reading them while she's
been playing in this huge pink tent in the livingroom. Also on the table are:

_Across the Line/ Al otro lado: The Poetry of Baja California_, Harry
Polkinhorn & Mark Weiss, eds.
_Immanent Visitor: Selected Poems of Jaime Saenz_, translated by Kent
Johnson and Forrest Gander
_Million Poems Journal_ Jordan Davis
_Waltzing Matilda_ Alice Notley
_V. Imp._ Nada Gordon (Faux Press)
_Morning Constitutional_ Michael Magee (Handwritten Press)
_Given_ Arielle Greenberg (Verse Press)
_Drawing on the Wall_  Harriet Zinnes (Marsh Hawk Press)
_Breath Takes_ Douglas Barbour (Wolsak and Wynn)

and my own stupid book A Defense of Poetry that I just put a crust of pizza
on. Mitchell Magee's artwork gracing the covers of COMBO is superb. It is
fun to tip in and out of these, you know? I am doing that now. Except
Douglas Barbour's and Harriet Zinnes' books are actually not on the table
because they're in my office in Illinois.

THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD

Thanks to websites (including weblogs) readers are now
considered nothing but traffic, visitors or hits.

This is something that makes me happy. As a reader and
as a writer (and as an intermediary between those two
monkeys--as a translator), I'm of the opinion that the
Reader has been overrated. So to see the Reader
transformed into "traffic" is more than ok.

Is this rank reduction of the Reader a revenge by the
Dead Authors Society?

Weblog writing is always an E-Go! Construction Site.
It may turn out to be the Electronic Return to the
Lyrical I.

(An Authority one needs to follow closer. ¿Daily? An
e-list by itself!)

But beware: Weblog writing is always recruiting.

I saw tonight where you alerted me in your blog that you had lost your
favorite fountain pen, a green Pelikan, with which you wrote your first
collection and wanted to tell you, though I do not halve your email, that I
found a crushed Pelikan M400 on the sidewalk in front of the New York
Palace early Saturday Dec 28th while attending the MLA conference. It
smelled that ferric smell of Pelikan blue-black ink (kind of mediciny). I
kept the shards if you want them, though the nib wasn't anywhere near the
smear of shattered plastic. I kept it because the piston mechanism was
still intact. (It was a plastic not a brass mechanism, so I'm assuming it
wasn't the M800).

Last spring in New Orleans I showed Pierre Joris an aerometric teal Parker
51 Demi hoping to make him jealous and he pretended to put it in his
sportcoat's breast pocket. I pretended to laugh at this but did not find it
that funny because it was my favorite fountain pen at the time and Pierre
made me put on a "fear grin" before he gave it back to me.

I gave Mairead Byrne three fountain pens for gift-day this year: 2
Esterbrook lever-fills from the 1940s (one large red and a little gray one)
and a modern Pilot Capless with broad nib (formerly known as Namiki
Vanishing Points) these are the ones without caps whose nib inside the pen
like a ballpoint.

I currently use a Lamy VISTA (fine nib) for my Roaring Spring lab books. I
am on my 19th roaring spring notebook. Using Lamy Blue-Black. The VISTAs
are the transparent plastic pens with a lifetime warranty that run around
25 bucks. So2metimes I use a Sheaffer Imperial Triumph from about 1962 just
because it's got great smoothness and rate of flow for such a fine nib. My
favorite fp of all time however remains my Pelikan M800, black, whose
iridium tip I ground to a stub.

Fountain pens are the only thing I can write with on paper. Once I was asked
how long ago I had suffered from a stoke and how did I manage so well after.
I just have bad penmanship with a BIC. But I am using a Waterman Phileas pen
that I found at the Office Max for 30 dollars and writes like the Mont Blanc
I lost years ago. If Shelley was alive today would he spend more on a Mont
Blanc to be cute :-)


The everlasting universe of things
Flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves,
Now dark--now glittering--now reflecting gloom--
Now lending splendour, where from secret springs
The source of human thought its tribute brings
Of waters--with a sound but half its own,
Such as a feeble brook will oft assume,
In the wild woods, among the mountains lone,
Where waterfalls around it leap for ever,
Where woods and winds contend, and a vast river
Over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves.



Give the Waterman a try, they even have fun colored inks too.

Bestest, Geoffrey

I was struck - well, not literally - by an Air Force spokesperson who
described the the use of amphetamines by bomber and other pilots on long
range missions as a "fatigue management tool." We will never know who coined
the term, but it took my lingua cake for the day. Apparently the "tool" was
not working well - or with diminished power - according to the lawyer for
two Air Force pilots (now facing trial) who bombed and killed ("friendly
fire") the Canadians on the ground in Afghanistan.
Not to make light of a tragic situation shielded from full view by what I
guess may be called the demonic poetics of battle, I do remember a sophomore
year of finals and popping a generous supply of pills provided by the Nurse
mom of my girl friend - I ended up, as we, at least, used to say "bombing"
one exam after another. Apparently, I had know idea how to "manage" my
"tool" quo tablets. Nobody died, gratefully. I paid for the damages in
summer school.

this is the record of an instantiation. i never replied to this so i
cannot tell you about the instantiation but i bet it was many things
together all equivalent but in different locations. and by the look of it
all these equivalent things were next to one another, nuzzled up against
one another, as if in neighborhood or a community of equivalent things.

the manifold models itself by exhuberant detail. the details transform the
mannifold into the transcendence of equivalence. what is identical is no
longer identical. what is identical is equivalent. identity is lost in
equivalence. everything is equivalent with a trace or surplus; everything
is equivalent to the degree of the diacritical.

there is no one. there is no many. number diffuses through membranes or
striations, threads of past identities. everything is literally
indescribable. what is described is the surface or manifold of a
mediation, a manifold of equivalences, across or through the multiplexing
of the real.

E-mail petitions don't do anything but give the signers a false sense
of having done something.

Not only are e-mail petitions an enormous waste of effort, no matter
how urgent and/or attractive the proposal may be, for many reasons
some of which are described here:
<http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/weekly/aa052798.htm?terms=npr>,
here:
<http://bsd.mojones.com/mother%5Fjones/MA99/fryerandchaudhry.html> &
here:
<http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/1999/05/10/petitions/index.html>;
it also turns out that the UN Information Center (oops, Centre) in
Washington DC is NOT distributing any such petition as can be read
here <http://unicwash.org/>.

Find a Web site that lists representatives to the UN for each country
& post that URL to the list. Then people can write, call or send
e-mail (& that's really the order with which most politicians will
give weight to your response. Because of the effort and costs
involved, a hard copy letter is a stronger statement than a phone
call, which in turn is a stronger statement than e-mail) on their own.

And a personally worded letter will be taken MUCH more seriously than
a copy of anything sent to you by an organization.

This is more work than adding your name to a piece of e-mail, but it
will arrive where you want it to & it might be read by someone who
might be affected by your arguments. E-mail petitions just end up
lost in the great aether.

Bests,

then Geoffrey Gatza said
>Fountain pens are the only thing I can write with on paper.

Understood, Geoffrey -- don't they seem to respond better to pressure,
grip, hand placement, position of one's feet, are refillable w/ different
color inks and different rates of soak and feathering into the page I write
better with fp's too. Gel pens offer some approximation of fp feel: Sailor
Innovation gels especially have an fp feel.

>I lost years ago. If Shelley was alive today would he spend more on a Mont
>Blanc to be cute :-)

I have a Phileas, it puts down a very wet line and it just feels really
well balanced, nice small section, and weight (they put a brass tube in the
barrel) and are consistently rated, along with the Lamy Safari (also the
Al-Star and Vista model versions of the Safari), as the best modern
fountain pen under $50 (AND both the Phileas and the Safari possess
lifetime warranties) Most often, the only real pen aficionados I know who
use Montblancs were given them as gifts. The nibs on MBs are often poor
quality, MB service is notoriously bad, the plastic of a Montblanc is
notoriously brittle--and all of this coming at ridiculous prices. I was
given an mb as my first pen and since then have kind of moved away from
them. I actually sold two MBs and gave a third away.

I'd like to think Shelley would know a good pen and would avoid a poor
quality high priced one. I could see him with a Namiki Falcon maybe,
something modern and responsive like his own souped-up sail boat. John
Tranter once sent me an article about Shelby Foote's love for dip pens and
some fp's and John'd signed it with a Rotring 600 using Waterman Florida
Blue ink (a stunning color) and I went out straight away and bought a
bottle, would write responses to students using a Sheaffer Legacy with
Florida Blue, though I stopped that because that blue had a tendency to
feather in some papers.

When I read, Geoffrey, about your Phileas, I took mine out and filled it.
ONly thing I dislike about the Phileas is the nibs come only in fine and
medium. I still stare daily at my LAMY VISTA: practical, tough, cheap
writes like a dream. With its big spring clip it can clip onto a sweater
neck of any thickness, its converter holds A LOT of ink, and the fact that
the whole pen is transparent gives it high bling-bling rating.

Good to meet another fp person, Geoffrey. g

Bits of Kids


wild clavicle evening, plus yellow teeth
who can I say is here?  little ones be

best to follow.  let fear enter the no.

in saliva waves, passwords that
quit out of cruel rains, stormtroopers

vex righteous lips during dire visions
of the present.  teach us piano if it's

like being stabbed.  mouths can do what
foxtraps will, unraveling into a bloom

yes, rebirth rancid in that parking lot.

appearance of power equals trust at
merging of tribes

lose sex organs and get sober to be
beatified, this lack of saints no joke

Who are the Big Boys? Can they keep their Spurs
                                           from Jingling and Jangling?

post-freakout street Opulence in all the Sticky moves
                                               Raindrops make on Tears

in an Effort to create a new better Salty way

welcome to the revolution such as it Is
                                    meeting now at AA mixers

and in the Heads of heroes

      Or opened envelopes

Ah, Gabe, indeed I was envious of your teal Parker 51 Demi (but,
honestly, I was only testing its' clip when I put it in my jacket's
breast pocket, cross my heart!) as over the years my favorite fp's have
been Parkers -- even though these days I use a Sheaffer (a special
edition I was offered in France & which was bought in the french Senate
& which I have never been able to locate elsewhere) & a M400 Pelikan,
as my ole 51 Parker has reached honorable retirement age, though from
time to time & refill and use it for the sheer nostalgia of it. Yes,
the Mont Blancs are widely overrated -- I was given two over the last
20 years & got irritated quickly with a certain grossness in feel they
exhibited & have shut them away -- though I still use & like the MB
pencil.

a nappy ewe's ear to you,

Pierre

evil, a falsehood


**************Free Prize Palace Newsletter**************

it's only in the symbolic that truth is found; it's only in the symbolic
that negation occurs. negation is a core trope in intelligence; what
differentiates, differentiates only by virtue of the potential for
veering, turning away.

Get the degree you NEED for a high paying job.

the symbolic is the repository of evil, the punishment of banishing, the
pale; the evil other is such by virtue of the symbol, primordial communi-
cation. humans exist naturally enough within the worlding of mediation and
representation; the evil symbolic both extends hegemony and creates

i read somewhere awhile ago about these Buddhist monks who would go into the mountains and make love when they heard about a war somewhere on the planet.  was this a book of fiction i wonder?  wish i could recall the text.  anyway, i liked the idea of countering, or balancing the negative energy on the planet with love-making.

Mime-version: 1.0

Not having the benefit of a blog to confide in, last night I consoled myself
with writing in my notebook. I had seen the beautiful, but very sad movie,
"Nicholas Nickleby." I thought about selfishness, cruelty and mean people,
recent events in the world and those threatening to come. Then I found that
the only thing that could pull me out of this fugue was to read some
Hazlitt. I read his excellent essay "On The Conversation of Authors."
Hazlitt loved and enjoyed his writer friends. "The conversation of authors
is better than that of most professions" he writes, and he goes on to
flatter his brilliant friends who included Lamb and Leigh Hunt and Coleridge
and Godwin. Lamb is witty and profound, Leigh Hunt entertaining but vacuous,
Coleridge fascinating but obscure, Godwin a bore. But he adds "Authors in
general are not good listeners. Some of the best talkers are, on this
account, the worst company; and some who are very indifferent, but very
great talkers, are as bad. It is sometimes wonderful to see how a person,
who has been entertaining or tiring a company by the hour together, drops
his countenance as if he had been shot, or had been seized with a sudden
lock-jaw, the moment anyone interposes a single observation..."  This essay
restored my spirits, and I thought about many great hours over the past year
spent reading and writing on this list. But I woke up in a bad mood. I
became preoccupied with the issue of shallowness and superficiality and
scribbled about it at length in my notebook. But what do other people think
about this? So, of course, I did what any contemporary web freak would do, I
went to Google and typed in "superficiality." All the entries were
themselves superficial but one, the third one listed. I had come full
circle. Has no one published anything intelligent about this topic since
1821? The listing, of course, was an essay by Hazlitt, and a great one. Here
it is, and I highly recommend it:

"Of course the people don't want war...that is understood.  But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it's always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it's a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship.  Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.  That is easy.  All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.  It works the same in any country."

By the way, I found one misprint in the essay reprinted at the URL I listed.
In my edition, (1934, Random House), the story of Lord Clive reads as
follows: "Lord Clive, when a boy, saw a butcher passing with a calf in a
cart. A companion whom he had with him said, "I should not like to be that
butcher!"- "I should not like to be that calf," replied the future Governor
of India, laughing at all sympathy but that with his own sufferings."

Now, I wonder. Perhaps the person who typed out this copy had the same
trouble making sense of this passage that I had. Why would Hazlitt make that
comment about the "future Governor of India." As a child, Lord Clive is
sympathizing with the calf, who must die, rather than the butcher, who must
do the killing. I would certainly agree with the "one day to be" Lord Clive,
and not his companion (who most likely was equally as young). Or was it the
fact that the boy laughed as he said it?

Also, this Hazlitt essay was not published in 1821 (I thought it was in
"Table Talk") but it was written around 1826.

I caught this misprint too, and like you, was initially puzzled.  But I think
I get it now.  Hazlitt's point is that Lord Clive perceives the hardship faced
by the butcher, as an overworked laborer, trivial enough for him to make a
joke about it, displacing his "sympathy" (in mock sentimentality) onto the
dumb animal he has slaughtered.

I think we, as a culture, have become sensitive to the issue of "animal
rights" in a way that Hazlitt's generation could only invoke as an absurdity,
and this confuses the logic of the anecdote for us.

p.s. Do you have a book or CD or something ?   I'm wondering how it would work

Dodie Bellamy's Spring Prose Workshop

There are a couple openings for my spring prose workshop, which will
meet 10 Wednesday evenings in my South of Market apartment from 7 to
10.  The dates: February 5 through April 16.

By prose I mean fiction, nonfiction, prose poetry, including (but not
exclusively) anything edgy or experimental.  The workshops are
totally open-ended.  Five people present a week, scheduling that the
week ahead.  Usually people bring in something 5 pages or less
(copies for everybody) and we critique it that week.  Longer pieces
are also okay, but they need to be handed out a week ahead of time
for people to read.  Each student typically gets a half an hour each
time we critique.  The classes are limited to 8 students.  Lots and
lots of personal attention.  They take place in my South of Market
apartment, which comes complete with snacks and one cat.

I'm the author of 4 books and I teach creative writing at SF State
and in the MFA program at Antioch Los Angeles.  I've also taught at
Naropa summer session, Mills, USF, UC Santa Cruz, and the SF Art
Institute.  I'm the winner of the Bay Guardian Goldie Award for
Literature and the Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Poetry.

If you're interested, please email about cost, work samples, etc.

Good editing, Maria. While the position is certainly feasible, it i9mplies
rather more passivity than one would expect from this talented woman. "In
one bouncing" would perhaps be better.

The Battle of the Spears! The pen is smightier...smites more and so on:  I
have a kind of fetish re pens: I like to have a large number of pencils of a
certain kind for marking book prices and these days (since I got "into"
books as such) I use pencils a lot,  either a ball point or one of those
(what are called) Artline pens and I write poems with those: next best would
be fountain pens: I recall owning my first as a boy it was more important to
me than..well many other things I think: it was called an Osmiroid (I think)
a name I treasure regardless of whether that was the name. (Iridium i think
also was the tip..."Iridium" ahhh) We also used ink bottles and at Primary
school (frm say 5 years to about 9 or 10) we had ink wells set in these
wooden desks: mine I scored with a pencil and all over it were "highways"
which I "raced' up and down and around endlessly ... but we could dip these
fixed pens in the ink wells the write with them(Antique shops sell th old
Rimu desks or were they just varnished pine?)
 But I dont see fountain pens nowadays: undoubtedly people collect them. I
dont go anywhere where they are or maybe dont notice them as I could afford
them so I'm not sure if one can buy them these days. I think they are
availalble but maybe not refillable....what is the foutain pen situation in
other places or can any NZ Lurker let me know re NZ?   Richard.  PS very
droll this pen inicident = an innocent incident

Nick and les autres....There is selfishness and cruelty but if people are
given a good environment without constant want or pressure (so the "good
environment" maybe both materially good and reasonably good in terms of the
requirements of human needs and the ability to to express and show and
actually use compassion love etc) your comment reminds me of the O Henry
story (set in NY as most were I believe..its simplistic but the protagonist
is walking (along) a NY street and thinking that all the others  going past
look mean and hurrying and hard and so on, and then he falls and is
hurt...immmediatly quite a number rush to his aid: now I'm reading a book
"The Mountain People" by Collin Turnbull about the Ik people who were
deprived of their hunting grounds in the mid sixties, tried to farm, couldnt
(beacuase the land they had was too arid) and degenerated into a society
that was absolutely self-centred and a-moral  ...the old and young children
were expendible (because useless), Turnbull finds that there was virtually
no compassion or love at all  (which is not the case in other "primitive"
societies) ...a child is let drop and dies, the mother is delighted (less to
feed - the people are always hungry or thirsty - as a leopard grabs it and
they are now abe to hunt kill and eat the leopard with the child cocnsumed
inside the leopard: it all makes the Mafia of "The Godfather" and  the
children in Golding's "Lord of the Flies" etc look pretty tame...so I think
it says , not that we are inherently evil, but that given harsh
cirumstances, given extremities of privation and derivation and fear and
suffering we can all become harsh and very self-centred: this phenomena is
seen in all countries at different times and sometimes is a constant in
societies where survival is chancy as indeed it came close to being in
Dickens's London ...Dickens's books   - which I read as a boy (they being my
father's favourite as he was from London) - show of course the humorous
aspects and not all the protagonists show this great selfishness (I'm not
talking of healthy self-esteem)...but certainly Dickens himself experienced
a  lot of suffering....I think that England and the US and my own country
have at least gone through certain "revolutions" or social "progresses" (a
dubious term) which mean that the best of the Judeao - Christian ideas of
the  "he who is without sin cast the first stone..", "love one another" and
so on have had some effect and certain ideas of liberty and fraternity (not
the requisite term nowadays) have taken hold and also the US Constitution
and the British Legal system and our own here....but that battles against an
enormous number of injustices throughout the whole world: that said, Colin
Turbull's "Mountain People" aside: we (I think the majority of us) probably
are still horrified by injustice, violence, famine, racism, insincerity, and
so on...so that at least argues that the majority are compassionate....given
they get the requisite information, and that they have the "luxury" to be so
(and I DONT mean that those people are either or not very wealthy in the
sense of large amounts of money or not ) - they may be relatively poor or
rich (such terms are relative any way)- as we also have in  most societies
in the world the capacity to develop morality and compassion (and or allow
the situation to be "prosperous" enough (cf the Ik)) and to think of and act
for others than ourselves: beginning with our own children, or those of
others we know, or those in teams or wherever we are; and extending that out
to others...the next step is for our politicians to choose discussion and
negotiation over war (while keeping a healthy army/military for self-defence
(national defence) until war is no more if it ever is....

But one does see the superficialities: people worrying about whether they
have more orgasms than some one else, how large their  breasts or penises
are, whether they have  better car than the neighbouurs ...some of these
things are harmless ...but the advertising people work on peoples'
insecurities....the England you are reading of was that of Imperialist
England (the land of Kitchener - who was a fine and handsome and a brave man
but an imperialist nevertheless) and also capitalism was in full roar there
with US and others racing to catch up: its fascinating to read those
nineteenth century writers (I like George Eliot of eg  "Middlemarch" )  and
also Lamb etc and others (the Russian writers - I love Chekov's stories and
his plays): but I think more people are sincere and non-superficial than one
might believe, even in those days when things maybe were (were tey?) ,
harsher... (although I have felt sad about this myself as you do Nick, I
dont know about others)...but we also need Orgasm competitions and a certain
dosage of Superficiality can do some over serioso personages some
considerable good: one can become to moralistic, fear disagreement (like
those writers/talkers who become "lock-jawed") too much, or disallow it,
....we also need to learn social communicativeness and compassion rather
than (or -  at least - as WELL AS ) how to do arithmetic and so on.

So some reality, a dash of humour, compassion, some knowledge, salt, George
Bowering's hat etc and some fountain pens, some Perelman and Thurber, some
Barthelme, some Silliman and Piombino etal, others, a lot of reading,
tolerance, beer, steak, poetry writing, Blogs, play chess of other "useless"
game, some seriousness when appropriate, curiosity, some Ashberic amazement:
all these are recquired Nick - read The Pickwick papers as a pick wick up!!
They are very funny (if you havent already)...I'm currently and rather
ponderously reading through Emily Dickinson's complete poems ( I get an
almost spiritual sense of/from her strange poems) and am tackling old
Pound's Cantos  (to use C Bern's phrase I'm "Pounding Fascism" (!) ) ..and
hence was diverted onto Dante and Ovid etc but got diverted to Monsieur
Turnbull (whose book gave me some awful nightmares) and for some reason I
was reading George Herbert's Poems and I'm still reading your book Nick -
the small one that's not much bigger than Wystan Curnow's small green book
of "poems and proses"...but I like your prose poems...I am attracted to the
prose-poem idea or method.....
  I think we are superficial if we concentrate on vain matters too
exclusively and dont listen to others and forget the immense significance
and stranegness of human consciousness and the being of people: that we each
matter and hence others do, the reality of that total being.  If we forget
the simple miracle of being alive - which sounds a bit Readers Digesty
maybe, but I used to like reading the Reader's Digest magazine: despite its
inanities there were some interesting things in it... Richard.

I guess this is why I keep feeling like I'm living in Germany right before
the war. By the way, I lived there for a few years right after it. Not very

Yes, I miss my "stylos plume" that I learned to like when I was in school in
France studying for the Bac.  I remember the ereasers we had, with one en d
erasing and the other end writing back in blue with ink that was permanent
and wasn't erased by the eraser fluid.  When I left France, I brought home
several pens and lots of ink cartridges and erasers, but my pens got stopped
up from lack of use and I can't get them to work again or haven't really
tried.  I was a Waterman fan,.  I liked the fifty franc stainless steel pens
which wrote much better than the fancy pen I got for high school graduation
(which was prpbably a Mont Blanc).   I hate fat pens, I don't feel I an
control them.  I don't know why marbelized plastic rates high prices.  SO I
go for metal pens that are thin...  I hate that cartrudges aren't standars
(but prefer teh Waterman style version with the double sized cartridges) and
was never a great fan of pens you have to fill with liquid ink.

1.explanatory notes
2.pipeloop #0006

the pipeloop series is from paul whitney's www.the-hyper-age.com

the title of the series is derived from the use of the pipe character as
the only punctuation mark usage with the exception of the question mark
which is used sparingly - the pipe character is very good for creating
text blocks - it is a strong visual punctuation mark - because it is so
strong i needed to offset some of this by using the question mark - the
question mark takes away some of the strong declarative power of the
pipe character - so these two characters each with their individual
properties
function well together as literary elements

the text content is drawn from three sources - one is eroticsm/pornographic
material - one is global military and political operations - one is the old
and
new testaments - with regard to the five books of moses and the bible i used
every english version i could find - so there are 10 or so versions all
combined
in the pipeloop series

i chose these three themes deliberately - one of my personal interests is in
the dichotomy
of sexual attraction or desire and violent conflict or repulsion - these
seem
to be the two driving forces that control our human condition - it appears
that we are either desiring something or rejecting something - the little
knowledge i have gained from my superficial exposure to different world
religions is that they all mention this dichotomy and describe it as a
condition
that the human being suffers - and that this condition is the symptomology
of the
physical nature of man - and that spiritual well-being and peace is found
through
freeing oneself from this condition

desire and disgust and freedom from desire and disgust is confusing
to me and seems impossible to resolve

pipeloop is a series that expresses my personal spiritual struggle

sincerely,
august highland

1.explanatory notes for methloop
2.methloop #0005


the methloop series is from a collection of works
by paul whitney - paul is the first member of the worlwide
literati mobilization network to include in-depth biographical
information in his introduction (www.the-hyper-age.com)

in methloop i am working with the recurrent insertion of a glossary
of textstrings into the main body of the text - the main body of the text
itself is based on a repetitive or looping formula - the textstrings i
selected
contain violent and horrifying imagery - i chose this thematic material
only in the methloop series - paul whitney has several series - i wanted
one of the series to contain violent thematic material because of the
pertinence this has right now to our political climate - i also chose
these textstrings because violence and horror has always been a genre
that i have never been able to read or watch - but a close writer-friend
does write horrifying imagery in some of his prose - this has always
been a side of his work that has been difficult for me to read - as our
middle east conflict began to loom larger and larger i decided to go
back and read my friend's violent prose and look at is as a metaphor -
when i was able to do this i decided to use textstrings from his work
and use it in the way i described above

i am very happy with the way this series turned out
one of the things that makes me happy is that it is in part a collaboration
with someone whom i admire as a writer and human being
i am also happy with the way in which the interspersed horror/violence
imagery works in juxtaposition to the larger multi-thematic body of
material

i am happy that i incorporated two literary elements that worked out
to my satisfaction: looping material that is always changing in conjunction
with reiterated material that is constant

bringing together polarized elements in a literary work is one of the things
i am always trying to achieve

sincerely
august

I have two Noblesses (ha!) bought during the great Staples Invasion of New
York that closed so many fine stationery stores (remember State, on 5th
Ave? around 18th St). Beautiful, and no complaints about the nib (whereas
the Waterman I ordered from Levenger was I go barefoot-barefoot-barefoot
scratchy), but the catch needed periodic tightening at the factory in New
Jersey, which looked to make the fifty percent I'd saved by working with
the soon-to-be-evacuated boutiquey places just evaporate. So I filed them
away and took up with the Pelikan, wrote like a dream (medium nib) and
the screw-cap...

was it Musician Magazine that informed us whatever musician "uses and
endorses Zildjian cymbals"? God save the punks! for releasing us from that
spell. Gabe, please to hang on to those Pelikan shards for me --

  dealer Doug Stuber, who had run Ralph Nader's Green Party presidential

  campaign in North Carolina in 2000, was pulled out of a boarding line and

  grounded. He was about to make an important trip to Prague to gather
artists

  for Henry James Art in Raleigh, N.C., when he was told (with ticket in
hand)

  that he was not allowed to fly out that day.


  Asking "why not?" he was told at Raleigh-Durham airport that because of the

  sniper attacks, no Greens were allowed to fly overseas on that day. The
next

  morning he returned, and instead of paying $670 round trip, was forced into

  a $2,600 "same day" air fare. But what happened to Stuber during the next
24

  hours is mind-boggling.


  Stuber arrived at the airport at 6 a.m. and his first flight wasn't due out

  until nearly six hours later. He had plenty of time. At exactly 10:52 a.m.,

  just before boarding was to begin, he was approached by police officer

  Stanley (the same policeman who ushered him out of the airport the day

  before), who said that he "wanted to talk" to him. Stuber went with the

  police officer, but reminded him that no one had said he couldn't fly, and

  that his flight was about to leave.


  Officer Stanley took Stuber into a room and questioned him for an hour.

  Around noon, Stanley had introduced him to two Secret Service agents. The

  agents took full eye-open pictures of Stuber with a digital camera. Then

  they asked him details about his family, where he lived, who he ever knew,

  what the Greens are up to, etc.


  At one point during his interrogation, Stuber asked if they really believed

  the Greens were equal to al Qaeda. Then they showed him a Justice
Department

  document that actually shows the Greens as likely terrorists -- just as

  likely as al Qaeda members. Stuber was released just before 1 PM, so he

  still had time to catch the later flight.


  The agents walked Stuber to the Delta counter and asked that he be given

  tickets for the flight so that he could make his connections. The airline

  official promptly printed tickets, which relieved Stuber, who assumed that

  the Secret Service hadn't stopped him from flying. Wrong! By the time
Stuber

  was about to board, officer Stanley once again ushered him out the door and

  told him: "Just go to Greensboro, where they don't know you, and be totally

  quiet about politics, and you can make it to Europe that way."


  In Greensboro, after Stuber showed his passport he was told that he could

  not fly overseas or domestically. Undeterred, he next traveled an

  hour-and-a-half to Charlotte. Of course, at Charlotte the same thing

  happened: "Get this terrorist out of here" was the mode the cops were in.

  Then Stuber drove three hours to his home after 43 hours of trying to catch

  a flight.


  Stuber concluded that the Greens, whose values include nonviolence, social

  justice, etc., are now labeled terrorists by the Ashcroft-led Justice

  Department.


  Blacklist Catch-22


  Questions about how one gets on a no-fly list creates questions about how
to

  get off it. This is a classic Catch-22 situation. The TSA says it compiles

  the list from names provided by other agencies, but it has no procedure for

  correcting a problem. Aggrieved parties would have to go to the agency that

  first reported their names. But for security reasons, the TSA won't
disclose

  which agency put someone on the no-fly list.

"Of course the people don't want war...that is understood.  But, afterall, it
is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it's always a
simple matter to drag the people along whether it's a democracy, a fascist
dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship.  Voice or no
voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That
is easy.  All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and
denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to
danger.  It works the same in any country."

Thanks for sending this.

My best friend is very involved in the CT Green Party and I do a little
volunteer work when he runs for office. Almost all the Greens I know are
progressive (former 60's liberal Democrats, even) and pacifistic. They're
more likely to debate the passenger next to them over  issues of foreign or
domestic policy than to kill the pilot and turn the plane into a missile. Of
course, they do engage in peaceful anti-war demonstrations. Obviously, some
people in power find this inconvenient and want to eliminate the Greens by
linking them with the heinous.

It's disappointing to see what happens when people trade their rights for
the illusion of increased security. But did we really expect anything
different?

Grounded
A federal agency confirms that it maintains an air-travel blacklist of =20=

1,000 people. Peace activists and civil libertarians fear they're on it.

- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Dave Lindorff



Nov. 15, 2002 =A0|=A0 Barbara Olshansky was at a Newark International =20=

Airport departure gate last May when an airline agent at the counter =20
checking her boarding pass called airport security. Olshansky was =20
subjected to a close search and then, though she was in view of other =20=

travelers, was ordered to pull her pants down. The Sept.=A011 terrorist =20=

attacks may have created a new era in airport security, but even so, =20
she was embarrassed and annoyed.

Perhaps one such incident might've been forgotten, but Olshansky, the =20=

assistant legal director for the left-leaning Center for Constitutional =20=

Rights, was pulled out of line for special attention the next time she =20=

flew. And the next time. And the next time. On one flight this past =20
September from Newark to Washington, six members of the center's staff, =20=

including Olshansky, were stopped and subjected to intense scrutiny, =20
even though they had purchased their tickets independently and had not =20=

checked in as a group. On that occasion, Olshansky got angry and =20
demanded to know why she had been singled out.

"The computer spit you out," she recalls the agent saying. "I don't =20
know why, and I don't have time to talk to you about it."

Olshansky and her colleagues are, apparently, not alone. For months, =20
rumors and anecdotes have circulated among left-wing and other activist =20=

groups about people who have been barred from flying or delayed at =20
security gates because they are "on a list."

But now, for the first time, a spokesman for the new Transportation =20
Security Administration has acknowledged that the government has a list =20=

of about 1,000 people who are deemed "threats to aviation" and not =20
allowed on airplanes under any circumstances. And in an interview with =20=

Salon, the official suggested that Olshansky and other political =20
activists may be on a separate list that subjects them to strict =20
scrutiny but allows them to fly.



_______
http://www.salon.com/letters/corrections/

"Grounded", a story published on Nov. 15, incorrectly reported that =20
attorney Barbara Olshansky of the Center for Constitutional Rights was =20=

attempting to board a JetBlue flight when she was stopped and =20
strip-searched earlier this year. In fact, when she flew out of Newark, =20=

she was not taking JetBlue. The story also reported incorrectly that =20
Green Party activist Doug Stuber, after being stopped from taking his =20=

planned flight from Raleigh-Durham, N.C., to Hamburg last month by U.S. =20=

Secret Service agents, was able to fly to his destination on a later =20
flight. In fact, after trying for two days at various airports, Stuber =20=

found he was barred from boarding any flight and missed his business =20
trip. The story also described Peace Action as a Roman Catholic =20
organization. In fact, it is not affliated with any religious group. =20
The story has been corrected. Salon regrets the errors.

Sweet Things and Chloral Hydrate
                      after Victor Hernandez Cruz and Jessica Hagedorn


Your skull made me dance with you
or a plantain hitting tito eddie n ray
Temple at 70 mph somewhere w/ plumjam eyelids
the ultimate disgrace I danced with you
                        in a roomful of mirrors
The campesino takes off his hat in miss harlow's house
As a sign of respect
towards the fury of the winds in town
And says: I smell death
Don't worry about the noise, the poet dying in a bar
Don't worry about the water, body shaking in time
Don't worry about the wind, to lady day's song
If you are going out, he's dying in a nod
beware of mangoes in a lullaby
And all such beautiful ambulance haze

Clanky Underwear
             after Gregory Corso and Gary Snyder


In daylight walk lay down these words
a gentleman by your side before your mind like rocks
I'll be placed solid, by hands
yet come nightlight in choice of place, set
a beastie in me you'll see before the body of the mind
not the pigkind rolling in the mud in space and time
…you'll know, my dear sweet wicce, solidity of bark, leaf or wall
what kind riprap of things
when your openings take cobble of milky way
my thiefy wand of blood straying planets
These poems, people
Ah…then we'll pillow talk lost ponies with
the night away, dragging saddles
'pon such things and rocky sure-foot trails
as never left the worlds like an endless
or came to stay four-dimensional
O sweet sack game of go
where our hearts ants and pebbles
submerged in the thin loam, each rock a word
breathes a creek-washed stone
Granite: ingrained
the continuum with torment of fire and weight
by thy behest crystal and sediment linked hot
I bequeathed all change, in thoughts
        As well as things

Maria, the American Association of University Professors website has info
re the "Patriot Act" but nothing (that I can find) on their website
indicates anything plans as nutso as that scary-deal alarum by "anonymous."
Check it: http://www.aaup.org/publications/Academe/02JF/02jfgr.htm

But Bush being the absolute slur-lipped hare-brained screwball he is, it
isn't beyond him to attempt something like this. Though there are several
former profs in congress who maybe at one time woulda gone down fighting
something like this, the preposterous, these days, is the plausible.

Loyalty: The act of binding yourself (intellectually or emotionally) to a
course of action.

Oath: The principle on which an oath is held to be binding is incidentally
laid down in (Hebrews 6:16) viz. as an ultimate appeal to divine authority
to ratify an assertion. On the same principle, that oath has always been
held most binding which appealed to the highest authority, as regards both
individuals and communities. As a consequence of this principle, appeals to
God=B9s name on the one hand, and to heathen deities on the other, are treate=
d
in scripture as tests of allegiance.


In God via Bush-Ashcroft-Rumsfeld-Rice etc. we sign & trust. Radically
enticing stuff -  indeed scary!

In the early fifties a fellow employee identified one of my aunts as a
member of the CP. She had to face California's Senate's Committee on
Un-American Activities. They had photographs of her at meetings. A smart
lawyer successfully persuaded the men on the Committee that she was only in
it for the boys. (No other kind of testimony could sway them - that of my
good liberal parents, included) She was Jewish and this was all happening a=
t
the same time the Rosenbergs were murdered (executed), the UC loyalty oath,
etc. I was about 10 and I remember it a very dark time. Along with the
revenge of the political right on the makers of the radical innovations of
the thirties, I remember having the gut feeling that part of the revenge wa=
s
deeply anti-Semitic.  Fortunately, by 1958 University students at Cal began
to take on the Committee's public hearings - the famous demonstration in Sa=
n
Francisco with the cops dragging students and banging their heads down the
marble steps of City Hall.

I am afraid the children (and converts) of this country's Right have again
become saturated with all too familiar waves of repressive nostalgia.
And another cycle to repeat.

JUST last night at a party i brought this up and most of the women didn't believe it was possible.  but if you knew Janet Mason, the Amazon Poet, man oh man, you would be a believer, A BELIEVER!  Janet's capable of ANYTHING!

i laughed when Maria Damon asked about the "sitting" part of my email.  well, okay, i'll just SAY IT!  i know nothing about vaginas, how they orgasm, how you position yourself to make it all nice, or how you, anything.  but i'm a gay man trapped in the body of a gay man, so it's not my fault.  although with all the lesbians i know you'd think i'd know more about all the pussy they keep talking about.  maybe i need to know MORE MORE MORE!  a friend DID give me a copy of Tee Corin's THE CUNT COLORING BOOK last year for my birthday, so, maybe i have a shiny new goal for 2003?  oh shiny goal!

I'm really liking _Treadwinds_ by Walter Lew, although of course there's
more to what he's created around that than can be put on paper -- but
it's fascinating so far; his use of (at last count) two writing systems
I can't read really confronts the issue of what literacy is. Actually,
that's a completely boring description of a really good book. Just read it.

Pierre, my apologies at misunderstanding your pocketing gesture with my pen
(it was horrifying!). One of the pens I most love to use (but rarely use
because I'm afraid of damaging it) is a midnight blue vacumatic Parker 51
with a *broad stub nib from 1943 or so (they rarely made broads on that
pen). I think they began making them in '41 Wish I knew what model Sheaffer
you're referring to. Its provenance (the French Senate) makes me want it.
Gen'l Eisenhower used a Parker 51 to sign the Armistice agreement in Europe.

Jordan, I thought way back on subsubpoetics 3 years ago you wrote with
great tears a story of crushing one of your Noblesses under your father's
car and losing another in a fountain (a real fountain pen). You may have
the Pelikan shards. But that is why I prefer the Lamy Al-Stars: these are
aluminum and I slammed one in a car door in Mississippi. It still works.
(It was a Ford Escort door though, these are light doors -- but I *was
annoyed by the video store clerk so I slammed it pretty hard). Once in
Auburn Prison, before I learned not to take shiny long objects into the
classroom, an inmate named Fu insisted I give him my aluminum Lamy. Because
the pen resembles a survival tool and could be used to shiv someone I did
not give it to him. He also put it in his pocket like Pierre did.

I'm very sorry about your Pelikan. Do you konw the Zoss Pen List? 1300
subscribers: you can get some very fine deals there, sub-ebay
prices,sub-anywhere prices...

<<Ah, Gabe, indeed I was envious of your teal Parker 51 Demi (but,
honestly, I was only testing its' clip when I put it in my jacket's
breast pocket, cross my heart!) as over the years my favorite fp's have
been Parkers -- even though these days I use a Sheaffer (a special
edition I was offered in France & which was bought in the french Senate
& which I have never been able to locate elsewhere) & a M400 Pelikan,
as my ole 51 Parker has reached honorable retirement age, though from
time to time & refill and use it for the sheer nostalgia of it. Yes,
the Mont Blancs are widely overrated -- I was given two over the last
20 years & got irritated quickly with a certain grossness in feel they
exhibited & have shut them away -- though I still use & like the MB
pencil.

a nappy ewe's ear to you,

Pierre

I think you are in the beginning stages of an extreme right wing shift. (you
may not ever get - except maybe on paper - a change in actual; Government in
the US...such a change may be deemed unpatriotic...elections may be deemed
so..whose to stop it happenning?). What for example is being done about
those poor bastards in Cuba? They are treated like animals or as if they had
no names or selves...that is totally aginst the code of human rights and is
unconstitutional...remember that eventually there was strong reaction
against McCarthy: these scum in charge of the US will get it... I applaud
that lawyer who is fighting for them (the alleged terrorists) in NY. Quite
likely S11 was orchestrated so that the Goebbels/ Goering philosophy could
be put in place. We on the left or any one with a conscience has to fight
this. Even the remote vestiges of democracy are disappearing....any of us,
even I here in NZ could be arrested tommorrow and simply disappear into a
military prison...reason: unpatriotic or supporting terrorists (it doesnt
matter how) and who is going to stop them?  We are all under fire here. The
danger, the difference is spreading and too many are fiddling.

Loyalty: The act of binding yourself (intellectually or emotionally) to a
course of action.

Oath: The principle on which an oath is held to be binding is incidentally
laid down in (Hebrews 6:16) viz. as an ultimate appeal to divine authority
to ratify an assertion. On the same principle, that oath has always been
held most binding which appealed to the highest authority, as regards both
individuals and communities. As a consequence of this principle, appeals to
God¹s name on the one hand, and to heathen deities on the other, are treated
in scripture as tests of allegiance.


In God via Bush-Ashcroft-Rumsfeld-Rice etc. we sign & trust. Radically
enticing stuff -  indeed scary!

In the early fifties a fellow employee identified one of my aunts as a
member of the CP. She had to face California's Senate's Committee on
Un-American Activities. They had photographs of her at meetings. A smart
lawyer successfully persuaded the men on the Committee that she was only in
it for the boys. (No other kind of testimony could sway them - that of my
good liberal parents, included) She was Jewish and this was all happening at
the same time the Rosenbergs were murdered (executed), the UC loyalty oath,
etc. I was about 10 and I remember it a very dark time. Along with the
revenge of the political right on the makers of the radical innovations of
the thirties, I remember having the gut feeling that part of the revenge was
deeply anti-Semitic.  Fortunately, by 1958 University students at Cal began
to take on the Committee's public hearings - the famous demonstration in San
Francisco with the cops dragging students and banging their heads down the
marble steps of City Hall.

I am afraid the children (and converts) of this country's Right have again
become saturated with all too familiar waves of repressive nostalgia.
And another cycle to repeat.

I can't find any source corroborating this report, but it seems to have
originated from the ZOG'S_WAR yahoo group:
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/armageddon-or-newage/message/25675>http://gr
oups.yahoo.com/group/armageddon-or-newage/message/25675

Deon Masker forwarded an email containing the exact message Maria Damon
forwarded us (hers from hengist@attbi.com, originally sent Dec 30, 2002) to the
armageddon-or-newage site I linked to above on Jan 1, 2003. The armageddon list
seems a little suspect, and a quick google on Masker indicates that she and her
husband, Richard, are "conspiratologists"
(<http://www.conspiratology.tsx.org/>http://www.conspiratology.tsx.org/)
associated with the white separatist movement and authors of some fairly wacked
out stories, mostly about the evils of government and "the Global, anti-White
Jewish controlled "'Communist Conspiracy.'"

Surely a story this big would be reported by sources other than our friendly
neighborhood conspiratologists. I'm betting it's bogus.

All the best,

The source doesnt matter its exactly what you can expect if the republicans

the methloop series is from a collection of works
by paul whitney

http://www.the-hyper-age.com/methloop/methloop0001.html

in methloop i am working with the recurrent insertion of a glossary
of textstrings into the main body of the text - the main body of the text
itself is based on a repetitive or looping formula - the textstrings i
selected
contain violent and horrifying imagery - i chose this thematic material
only in the methloop series - paul whitney has several series - i wanted
one of the series to contain violent thematic material because of the
pertinence this has right now to our political climate - i also chose
these textstrings because violence and horror has always been a genre
that i have never been able to read or watch - but a close writer-friend
does write horrifying imagery in some of his prose - this has always
been a side of his work that has been difficult for me to read - as our
middle east conflict began to loom larger and larger i decided to go
back and read my friend's violent prose and look at is as a metaphor -
when i was able to do this i decided to use textstrings from his work
and use it in the way i described above

i am very happy with the way this series turned out
one of the things that makes me happy is that it is in part a collaboration
with someone whom i admire as a writer and human being
i am also happy with the way in which the interspersed horror/violence
imagery works in juxtaposition to the larger multi-thematic body of
material

i am happy that i incorporated two literary elements that worked out
to my satisfaction: looping material that is always changing in conjunction
with reiterated material that is constant

bringing together polarized elements in a literary work is one of the things
i am always trying to achieve

**********************************************************

the pipeloop series is also from a collection of works
by paul whitney

http://www.the-hyper-age.com/pipeloop/pipeloop0001.html

the title of the series is derived from the use of the pipe character as
the only punctuation mark usage with the exception of the question mark
which is used sparingly - the pipe character is very good for creating
text blocks - it is a strong visual punctuation mark - because it is so
strong i needed to offset some of this by using the question mark - the
question mark takes away some of the strong declarative power of the
pipe character - so these two characters each with their individual
properties
function well together as literary elements

the text content is drawn from three sources - one is eroticsm/pornographic
material - one is global military and political operations - one is the old
and
new testaments - with regard to the five books of moses and the bible i used
every english version i could find - so there are 10 or so versions all
combined
in the pipeloop series

i chose these three themes deliberately - one of my personal interests is in
the dichotomy
of sexual attraction or desire and violent conflict or repulsion - these
seem
to be the two driving forces that control our human condition - it appears
that we are either desiring something or rejecting something - the little
knowledge i have gained from my superficial exposure to different world
religions is that they all mention this dichotomy and describe it as a
condition
that the human being suffers - and that this condition is the symptomology
of the
physical nature of man - and that spiritual well-being and peace is found
through
freeing oneself from this condition

desire and disgust and freedom from desire and disgust is confusing
to me and seems impossible to resolve

pipeloop is a series that expresses my personal spiritual struggle

Britain denies asylum for gay pianistPeter Moore, 365Gay.com
Monday, January 6, 2003 / 04:09 PM


A man regarded as one of the most promising young pianists playing in
Britain has been ordered to return to his native Zimbabwe despite his
fears he will be persecuted because he is gay.

Michael Brownlee Walker, 25, won a place five years ago to study
classical piano at the prestigious Royal Northern College of Music in
Manchester.

A year ago he filed for asylum, on the grounds he is gay and would be
persecuted if he returned.

The fact he is the great-grandson of one of Zimbabwe's earliest white
settlers does not worry him as much as his sexuality.

Zimbabwe strongman Robert Mugabe has denounced gays, calling them
"worse than dogs and pigs," and ordered police to help "root the evil
out." Hundreds of gay men and lesbians have fled the country.

"There is no rule of law any more," said Brownlee Walker. "If the
police say they want to detain you, there is very little you can do."

The Home Office has rejected his application for asylum. He has no
family left in Zimbabwe; his parents fled after their farm was overrun
last Easter.

Brownlee Walker, who has lost a considerable amount of weight and
received hospital treatment during the period of his asylum
application, now has no income. His $50.00 a week asylum seekers'
allowance was stopped before Christmas, and he is no longer allowed to
accept offers of work. He is living in London at the home of the
acclaimed concert pianist, Leslie Howard, an old family friend. Howard
believes Brownlee Walker has an unusual musical talent and would be
unable to pursue a career in Zimbabwe.

British gay rights activists have taken up his cause.

"Victimization of the gay community is universal and constant in
Zimbabwe," said Peter Tatchell. "But every gay person is at risk of
being picked on and made an example of. In these circumstances no one
is safe."

Tatchell has been trying for several years to get Mugabe arrested for
crimes against humanity, but has been unable to get police to lay the
charges. Two years ago he was beaten by Mugabe bodyguards in Brussels
when he attempted to perform a citizen's arrest.

The Home Secretary suspended enforced deportations to Zimbabwe a year
ago, but the threat is still there. Even though he could remain in
Britain under his current status, he is unable to earn a living, making
him a virtual refugee.

Familarity breeds belief (what goes around comes around, etc.). & I fell for
it. The white supremacist source sounds suspect - yet they may now be
sophisticates at sewing this kind of paranoia among academics.   I suspect -
in view of Bush's "round up" charge for the INS and Airport Security to
profile, detain, etc. Arab males and anti-war leaders  - that the doc is the
work of a legitimate apprehension. Ideally it shakes the campus nest and
compels the vulnerable to create protective strategies. Though I was
reminded last night by a UC professor that new faculty  at both UC and State
campus' routinely sign a version of the old loyalty oath (you don't belong
to an org that will violently overthrow the the state) as a condition
employment. 'The sign with gritted teeth clause' that many of us have
occasionally 'had to' sign to have a job at all. Adjunct employees,
ironically, are not reciprocated with job loyalty of another kind. An
additional more bitter than sweet act of state fidelity.

I looked online and didn't see any articles requiring people to sign loyalty
oaths. But the act itself does exist. Congress passed it. When Reagan wanted
a Drug Free Workplace, some people receiving Federal funds had to sign a
statement. If Bush didn't dictate the signing of an oath, I would guess,
based on my former life as a government employee, that some misguided
bureaucrat will try to get people to sign it.

sam, the evil of language is thus the establishment, within identity, of
ethos and discrimination. the two common senses of the latter shade into
each other; to discriminate is to judge; to judge is to decree; to decree
is to choose; to choose is to punish.

deployment of the self, cultivation of the other.

cambridge, thankfulness is in recognition, of the comfort, as well, of

it is characterized by the ability to create and deploy it, as well.

FIRST SPEED OF GRAVITY MEASUREMENT REVEALED

The speed of gravity has been measured for the first time. The
landmark experiment shows that it travels at the speed of light,
meaning that Einstein's general theory of relativity has passed
another test with flying colours.

Researchers made the measurement of the fundamental physical
constant with the help of the planet Jupiter. One important
consequence of the result is that it will help constrain the number
of possible dimensions in the Universe

I want to thanks all of the people who recommended books and sites for the
Irish poet Paul Durcan.

I read a bunch over the last few weeks and I am really looking forward to
meeting the fellow and hearing him read.

Thanks again!

'The buildup of American forces in the Persian Gulf

Iraq, where a volunteer army staged a parade to
emphasize preparations by Iraqis to defend their
cities and towns.

Women in units of about 100, each with a different

Philip Freneau (The Republican Poet) of Princeton University complainaing
about a loss of journalistic standards reflected in a review of Gudding's
new book by an apparently easily offended and very "moral" student, and they
publish it!  What a double hoot!  Why be surprised that they did not check
on the name, that it did not register.

They were too busy looking at the pinstripes.

1. explanatory notes for byteloop
2. byteloop #0004

****************
byteloop the third series in the paul whitney collection
(www.the-hyper-age.com) is a cleanly trimmed or stripped-down
approach - i compare it to listening to one track of a
sound recording - or like reading the bassline of a bach
chorale - it is also like a compressed file - i like to
think of byteloop as a highly compressed literary object
that self-extracts in your head -

there is also the repetition motif - when i was little
i used to stutter - when i got over stuttering i would
repeat words silently with my lips - i never thought
it was a problem - it looked funny to my mother though - so
i learned to stop it - but i did it because i loved the
sound of the words so much - finally with byteloop i have
been able to use this in a literary work -

one last element is the way in which the repetitions slowly
change with one unit fading out while a new unit fades in
i used to host a 3-hour midnight radio program on a public
radio station on which i played techno ambient and
industrial music - often i played more than one music source
at a time - for example i would use both cd players and both
cassette players and both turntables at the same time while
fading in and fading out the different components - i
see myself doing this in byteloop too

have you ever read Krishnamurti's FREEDOM FROM THE KNOWN Nada?
what i LOVE about that book is how you can CLOSE the book at
any point with a thought in mind from reading, and realize the
title of the book IS ALWAYS what he's trying to get across.
he's such a brilliant fucking mind!  he's very harsh, all the
time, never letting you up from the headlock until you get it.
he told Blavatsky a thing or two when she tried to get him to
rally the troops and play guru in Philadelphia.
more later,
Conrad

   "The arrival of the audiocassette in Yemen during the 50's
   and 60's signalled important new possibilities for poets...
   capable of making the voice instantly inscribable, reproducible,

Flagg Miller is a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of
Anthropology at the University of Chicago, and is in the process of
writing a book entitled The Moral Resonance of Media: The
Circulation of Cassette Poetry in Modern Yemen. His book examines
discourses of circulation that engage poets, singers, and audiences
as new media technologies are brought to bear on political
versification in Yemen. Much of his research explores how the
problematic of circulation provides a valued moral framework for
enabling cultural and political change. He has published articles
in the International Journal of Middle East Studies and the Journal
of Women's History, among other venues. A linguistic
anthropologist, Dr. Miller has lived and studied in the Middle East
and North Africa, including Tunisia, Syria, and Yemen, for over
four years.

Ron Silliman just wrote me with a welcome to the club of those who've
received mean reviews (I am referring to a review in a student magazine),
said it's part of the rites of passage for poets etc etc. He quoted bits of
Robert Sward's review of Clark Coolidge in Poetry back in '67. He mention
Andrei Codrescu calling him (Ron) a Stalinist thug.

This got me to thinking: I would like to make an anthology -- in the manner
of Nicolas Slonimsky's _Lexicon of Musical Invective_ -- of dismal, savage,
hurtful, scathing, or obviously spiteful poetry reviews. The word "review"
will here be taken loosely: any published piece containing commentary about
poets and/or poetry. The review may focus on a person, a text (passage,
poem, volume of poetry, anthology, periodical, webzine, etc etc), a genre
(eg, prose poetry), a style, a group of poets, or a school. The review or
commentary may be poorly written or excellently argued. Ad hominem attack
will of course be considered, so long as I can determine that its inclusion
in the anthology will not be considered actionable. I would prefer not to
limit the anthology by nationality or identity, only temporally: only those
reviews published in this and the previous century.

There are two basic purposes behind this anthology: (1) to show the contest
behind taste [or the contest that is taste]; (2) to show the metamorphosis
of taste over time (in, say, Alan's [Golding's] outlaw to classic arc,
yes--but also, frankly, in the arc of the dud).

Proviso: these reviews must have already been published. Please send either
full text or url links to me via post or email (contact info below). Please
include full citation as to when and where the piece or pieces were
published (eg, do not send excised snippets) -- and where possible full
text.  Thank you.

Some have alerted me to _Rotten Reviews_ by Wm Henderson and Andre Bernard
(Pushcart Press and, later, Penguin) but this does not focus exclusively on
poetry...

and please do keep in mind that, though I can imagine many of the
selections being very short, I would like the entire "review" or larger
passage, cum citation... thanks

The Poetry Project=B9s Spring Writing Workshops

***

IMAGINATIVE WRITING - JORDAN DAVIS
Tuesdays at 7pm: 10 Sessions Beginning February 18
This course will review material from grades K-12 and college, with an
emphasis on serious play, providing an introduction to four domains of
magnetic interiority and social interaction: basic sequences, p sequences
(flarf), three-dimensional lineation, and gestalt maps. An overview of
poem-writing, criticism-giving, world-ing. Emphasizes how your current
search skills apply to global databases. Blogging is optional but
recommended. The course concludes with a publication and performance. Jorda=
n
Davis's most recent books are Million Poems Journal (Faux Press) and A
Winter Magazine (Situations). He is an editor of The Hat.

THE BEST-LOVED TALES OF THE MILLENNIUM (START HERE) - SHARON MESMER
Fridays at 7pm: 10 Sessions Beginning February 21
In this workshop, we will investigate the dynamic, permeable  boundaries of
poetry and story by producing a variety of "tales": creation stories,
narrative poems, "palm-of-the-hand" stories, vignettes, prose poem-stories,
monologues, dream stories, short plays, folk stories, and fairy tales. Mode=
l
texts by both poets and prose writers will be used to spark in-class
discussions and aid production, and to prove that it is possible to flow th=
e
language, rhythm, and imagery of poetry into the more formal (yet always
malleable) structures of story-telling. Sharon Mesmer=B9s books include
collections of stories, The Empty Quarter, and poems, Half Angel, Half
Lunch.=20

POETRY WORKSHOP - DAVID HENDERSON
Saturdays at 12pm: 10 Sessions Beginning February 22
Henderson writes, "We are making manuscripts of our work (at whatever stage
the work or the poet or both are). As poets we are also looking at and
sometimes working with prose, as another form of poetry, as well as other
forms of poetry such as lyrics, raps, spoken word form[ats] or even simple
lines--good in and of themselves. We practice exercises and routines of the
poet. We often listen to the works of each other--in progress. And there is
always the right to just read a work without comment or criticism." Poet,
lyricist, and biographer David Henderson is the author of several books,
including Jimi Hendrix: Voodoo Child of the Aquarian Age and Neo-California=
.

it is the internal and external placement of equivalent entities that

the enumeration is also by zero and one, so that in fact we may say
f_zz(0,1,n) = f_zz(0,1,(0,1)). in the nth position, 0 or 1 is mapped;
the nth position itself is mapped by 0 or 1. we could go on with a

so the binary is equivalent but within the file by virtue of emplacement.
and equivalence itself tends simultaneously towards eternity and existence.

binary equivalence, within and without the limitations of the apparatus of
transmission, is the simulacrum of the defeat of death. the sending of zz
does not eliminate zz; what is sent also remains.

thus one notices that every instantiation of a file is equivalent by
virtue of the differentiation of emplacement as well.

the instantiation is the residue of the file. the file is a collocation of
binary residues.

in fact we may problematize equivalence as follows: if a = b, one might
also say -(a = a); a is never equivalent to itself. an instantiation of a
is equivalent to an other instantiation of a, but an instantiation is not
equivalent to itself since each instantiation is unique.

20021212 19:11:59 /usr/bin/sz -vv -b zz
20021212 19:11:59 Sending: zz

we have then if a = b and b = c, then a = c; a = b implies b = a.

the negation of a is also problematic. one might say for example that
-a(0,1) = a(1,0), the complement; one might  also say -a = 0, the
annihilation of a; one might also say -a = {x: x= not-a} or that -a=U-a
(the universe of discourse excluding a).

0000060 31354 12810 12336 12594 12848  8246 12592 12346
we could go on with a phenomenology of negation.

you are sending the file across the courtyard. it is a different
instantiation. noise is parasitic and below the threshold but not
always. the receiver is there but not always. let us say the equivalent
file reaches its destination. let us say the destination is a receiver.

it is an instance of the file with or without an origin. it is an
imminence of appearance. the appearance is a layer (software, hardware) of
interpretation, representation. the layer processes within the receiver. a
secondary residue, that of interpretive response, exists. one interpretive
response is not equivalent to another; every monitor is different in terms
of configuration - in terms of instantiation.

the appearance is also fundamentally binary, zeros and ones.

1. explanatory notes
2. typeloop #0004 (excerpt)

typeloop is the first series in the paul whitney
collection at www.the-hyper-age.com - for being just
your average joe (read paul's bio in his introduction)
paul whitney is one of the most
prolific members of the worldwide literati mobilization
network -

typeloop is very close in design to the work of
teddy warburg who is the critical theoretician of the
wlmn at www.voice-of-the-village.com - the difference
between paul and teddy is that teddy has one literary
approach and works with one body of source materials
paul whitney is more open and flexible than teddy and
has drawn from teddy's ideas and literary style
to produce a body of work that
is more heartfelt and embedded in life-experience - teddy
warburg's aesthetic practice is a distancing from his
feelings and an espousing of the ethereal - paul whitney
is the reverse - his motto is down with the etheral and
long live the ephemeral -

the looping of text in typeloop proceeds very fluidly
with the text streaming forward without too
many breaks - it is a very lovely series because it is
very direct and encompasses a wide range of emotion and
thematic material - for this reason it can be the most
challenging to the reader's text receptivity - a series
like byteloop or pipeloop or methloop are confined to
particular themes and have sharply defined borders -
typeloop is a very spacious series and accomodates an
oceanic current of emotional signifiers and experiential
messenging - typeloop is a suspension in time and delays
closure by interpretation - it is a cellular bath - and has
a high proportion of signal to noise

Poet laureate, spoken word poets clash
Last Updated 2003-01-06

Trevor Hughes, The Arts Report

VANCOUVER - Canada's newly appointed poet laureate has started a war
of words with a spoken word poet based in Vancouver.

In a recent Globe and Mail article, poet laureate George Bowering
denounced slam, or spoken word, poetry and poetry competitions as
"revolting."

Treating poetry as a competition is "crude and extremely revolting",
Bowering told the Globe.

Vancouver-based spoken word poet T. Paul Ste. Marie says he's angry,
and has received dozens of e-mails from other frustrated slam poets.

To Ste. Marie, who hosts and produces open mike sessions for spoken
word artists, Bowering isn't following his job description.

"Obviously this is shaking up his system," said Ste. Marie. "I mean,
one of the roles and responsibilities of the parliamentary poet
laureate is to sponsor poetry readings."

Bowering says he fully appreciates poets who get up in front of a
microphone. What he says he has a problem with are poets who use
language to get what they want.

A true classic poet, says Bowering, is humble before the word and
respects language. He says a poet who uses poetry to win a competition
for his or her own glory is missing the point.

"[Poetry] as a servant of language rather than the other way around,"
said Bowering. "That's my main argument."

But he says poets are at their best when they have different views,
using arguments to provoke thought.

YES, YOU ARE A REVOLUTIONARY!
was one of my favorite books of poetry in 2002
Sparrow is an amazing poet
check him out.  here's a tiny sample:

"Fill a football with basil
and throw it around with your friends.
Doesn't it smell good?

It's a basil football."
--Sparrow, from YES, YOU ARE A REVOLUTIONARY!
(Soft Skull Press, 2002, in a store near you)

The Compendium of Poetic Style Part I: The Spoken Word

You have a right to be mad.  Your culture sucks.  Your life sucks.  And
you=B9re bored out of your skull, sitting in your Major British Authors cours=
e
listening to the professor drone on and on about Milton=B9s profound use of
metre, verse form, allusion, metaphor and something called, get this,
synecdoche.  Don=B9t any of these academics realize that poetry isn=B9t about
hacking through mounds of poems in some anthology written by a bunch of dea=
d
guys?  Can=B9t they figure out that these poets couldn=B9t possibly have
intended to say all the things they=B9re finding in their work?  Hey - Kurt
Cobain made a statement far more profound by shooting himself in the fuckin=
g
head than these dead white guys could in hundreds of their poems!  Fuck
Milton!  Fuck academics! Fuck my parents for making me be here!

Does this passage describe you, or someone you are sympathetic to? Then get
out your vintage 80s track wear, slide on your "geek-chic" horn-rimmed
glasses and affix that nose-stud:  the spoken word might just be the style
you=B9ve been waiting for. It=B9s true: far beyond the dusty corridors of the
Ivory Tower there are poets who have overthrown their chains and are
competing for cash and prizes in the bars and caf=E9s of your very city! It=B9s
called a Poetry Slam, popularized in cultural hotbeds like New York City an=
d
Chicago!  With cred like that, it must be World-Class!

Just ask any Spoken Worder:  the Poetry Slam is at the forefront of a poetr=
y
resurgence.  It=B9s a chance for people not only to speak their minds on
stage, but also to have their opinions and performance abilities compete
head-to-head with others of their ilk!  It=B9s a kick in the face to mass
market culture!  It=B9s a return to the oral-based heritage of pre-capitalist
societies! It=B9s your chance to take the lead in yet another poetry
resurgance!

I want in, you cry!  But how do I write a spoken word poem?  Good question.
The first thing to note is that the spoken word is not about writing poems,
it=B9s about winning slams.  With that in mind, then, here are 8 useful tips:

 1.  Keep it simple. Try hard to forget eveything you have learned in your
English classes.  Exhibiting a knowledge of poetry may cause judges to thin=
k
you=B9re a holier-than-thou writer from the other side, and such alienation i=
s
sure to cost you points. Instead, aim your poetry at the lowest common
denominator in the audience - if that grade 10 kid who just snuck into the
bar approves of your poem then you are on the right track.  Remember:  if
anyone asks about your method, always replace the phrase =B3lowest common
denominator=B2 with =B3the people=B2.

2.  Have something to say - but make sure that someone has already said it
before.  Novelty is confusing - and being confusing can cost you contests!
A good method of acquiring something to say is to listen to others in your
particular spoken-word scene (don=B9t over do it, a few open mikes should
suffice). If one of the spoken worders strikes you as expressing you own
innermost thoughts - then copy=B9em!  Don=B9t worry about plagiarism -- you wil=
l
be startled when you notice how your own individual presentation style
bleeds through as you try to write someone else=B9s words!  Not only is this =
a
proven rule of success -- if one of the judges happens to be the person you
are imitating you=B9ll be an instant winner! Still can=B9t find anything to say=
?
You can always...

3.  Talk about the battle of the sexes!  If there is one thing that unites
all people regardless of age or race, it=B9s the wacky love-hate relationship
between boys-and-girls.  And to be frank, nothing can be funnier!   Here's =
a
theme for the female spoken worders in our reading audience:  =B3isn=B9t it
annoying how guys act so much like, well, guys=B2. Now that's a poem that is
sure to get the judges=B9 feminist fires stoked! But guys =AD don't take that
lying down. You've been given the power of poetry to exact revenge on every
woman who emasculated you, dumped you, or wouldn't date you in the first
place. So make a list of everything that pisses you off about your life,
then try to find a way to blame women for it all. What's great about
post-feminism is that you can call women any derogatory name you want and
it'll be taken as a sign of female empowerment. Now in the unlikely event
that it's taken by the judges as a sign of misogyny, just mention that ia
woman you know once read the poem and liked, it so it couldn't possibly be
sexist. OK guys, if that's not quite doing it for you, i suggest that you..=
.

4. Be gay. If you=B9re gay -- you instantly double your credibility and
dramatically increase your odds!  Make sure to talk about the minute detail=
s
of your failed relationships and salt your poetry with funny, catty, campy
phrases that audiences have come to expect from gay poets. Even if your
judges don't know what "droll" means, they'll certainly give you points whe=
n
they see it.

5.  Talk loudly. This is a useful point about presentation:  being loud
means confidence, and confidence means that you know what you are talking
about. Besides, talking loudly proves that you are not one of those wimpy,
introspective, genteel academic writers. But remember to pace your =B3loud
bits=B2.  The average attention span is around 15 seconds, and nothing wakes
up an audience more effectively than screaming at them.  Use the bartender
as a guide: if he looks nervous and stares at lot at his figitting regulars=
,
then your volume is perfect.

6.  Be streetwise. Tell=B9em how cynical you have become after realizing what
life on the street is really about (just like they do at the Nu Yorican
slams in Manhattan)!  A proven method of conveying your cynicism is
convincing your audience that you have =B3been there=B2 (the street, that is).
Powerful images associated with the ravages of drug and alcohol abuse help.
If you are particularly daring you can do a dramatic poem wherein you
pretend you are a struggling junkie or a callous pusher.  Always end your
poem with a =B3don=B9t be like me=B2 moral.  Tip:  Go watch Trainspotting and
Drugstore Cowboy again.  How do they make you feel?  Do you find the =B3toile=
t
scene=B2 in Trainspotting to be a profound statement on life?  Don=B9t just sit
there -- write a poem.  Don=B9t forget to swear sometimes -- cynical,
streetwise people are angry, and nothing says anger better than bad words.

7.  Always direct your poem at your parents.  Though you are an angry,
cynical, streetwise poet, you are not angry at your audience.  The audience
is composed of friends, compatriots and, most importantly, judges, so why
piss them off?  Instead, picture your folks and their comfortable suburban
lives.  What emotions are stimulated by this scene?  What would you like to
say about their sheltered fifties complacency?  What would you like to tell
them regarding their yuppie hypocrisy? What would the look on their faces b=
e
when you show them the hard, messy, drug-addled reality that is life on the
street?  How would they react to the gooey details of your sex-life?  Would
they be shocked?  Would they be forced to look at the sham that is their
life?  Of course they would -- so what are you waiting for -- write it
down..  Don=B9t worry about being kicked out -- they=B9ll never read it!
Besides, this is what a slam is for -- a place to feel the comradery of
anger and rage without suffering any repercussions! You might even win!!

8.  Be funny.  Anger wins respect.  Laughter wins slams.  Being funny is no=
t
all that hard.  Think about all the amusing things in your life.  Then writ=
e
about them all at the same time. Hey -- your parents are funny. Living in
the basement is funny. Body-art is funny.  Being loud is funny.  Your
ex-boyfriend is funny.  Castration is funny.  Sex is really really funny
(see rule 3).  Having loud sex in your parents=B9 basement  with your tatooed
ex-boyfriend with eyes to castrating him afterwards is a laugh riot.  See
how easy this is?

9.  Bring a guitar.  If you remember only one rule about winning slams --
this is it.  And if you don=B9t have a guitar, find a guitarist and bring the=
m
along.  I can=B9t emphasize this too strongly:  the person with the guitar
wins the slam.  If they don=B9t, they=B9ll at least place on the podium.
Guaranteed.  The reason is simple -- people like folk singers. They=B9ll even
pay $15 bucks for a Jewel CD (you can always dream).  The best part of it i=
s
that you don=B9t even have to know how to write a song! The mere presence of =
a
few chords strumming along with your poem & you=B9ll come off sounding like
Dylan (if you are a folk singer, however, don=B9t make the mistake of singing
your songs -- this is the spoken word after all). If you want to top the
spoken worders with acoustic guitars, I recommend the addition of a stand-u=
p
double-bass.  A walking bassline behind your poem is not only a sure-fire
crowd-pleaser, it will add a bluesy feel reminiscent of the Chicago
tradition.  To secure this connection, and the streetcred that accompanies
it, one needs only to add the phrase =B3talkin=B9 blues=B2 to the title of your
poem and repeat every line in the piece three times, placing a different
emphasis every time.  For instance, if your poem is called =B3Trainspotting
Toilet=B2 and your first line is =B3Life is a toilet: no matter how much you
flush it you still come up shit.=B2 then  =B3The Trainspotting Toilet Talkin=B9
Blues=B2 will read =B3Life is a _toilet_: no matter how much you flush it you
still come up shit.  I said, life _is_ a toilet: no matter how much you
flush it_ you still come up shit. Yeah, life is a toilet: no matter how muc=
h
you flush it you still _come up shit_.  You know what I am talking about...=
=B2
Works every time.  Bring on the prizes.

Oh no. I see it coming. One of these "i'm better than you because you do something different" feuds brewing.

Let's fess up. I can admit that most experimental poets I like could use a spoken-wordish kick in the tail during their readings- so we know they're alive. Unless that would be evidence that they're not "serious".

Most Spoken Word artists I've seen could use some canon in their cannon, if they're interested in more than a loud noise.

Can we admit this? We have enough wars without end on the horizon.

I consider poetry slams a mixed blessing.

On the plus side, slams have made more people aware of and interested in
poetry, as writers or audiences.

I've found some work reading as a featured reader at slams.

On the down side, the scoring in slams is very arbitrary, sometimes
blatantly unfair. Bob Holman once told me "the best poet doesn't win the
slam." Usually it's the best performer or the poet with the hottest topic.
In general, I don't like the competitive aspect of slams.

In recent years, poetry slams have become "Slam Poetry," a genre in itself,
emphasizing autobiographical work and the performance element and excluding
other forms of poetry. Ten or more years ago, you could have a language poet
(e.g. Edwin Torres) face off against a confessional poet, but I doubt you'd
find it these days.

Since my own work in recent years has inclined toward langpo and multiple
voicings that serve contrapuntal functions, I'm no longer likely to find a
reading at a slam. When I do read in public, I try to educate the audience
about what I'm doing, or include the audience by asking them to come up and
read my contrapuntal sections while I read. I think we should try to help
the audiences understand something most of them have never been exposed to,
if only because it might keep us from dying onstage.

I think most poets could learn something from slams about juicing up their
own readings. But the slammers should also learn that there's more than one
kind of poetry, something that got lost in the mid-90's.

hey, i just got an idea for a whimsical anthology:
"Folk Tales for Poetry Addicts,"
so, all you poets and poetry lovers and haters, send your vignettes
and favorite numinous or anti-numinous, humorous or harrowing,
analytic or impressionistic anecdotes about poetry and the poetic to
me, via email.

I rarely add comments to this list, but I find the comments by Bill Kennedy
(I assume that is William Kennedy of Albany) particularly insulting because
I am a younger Albany based poet who has organized readings in the city. His
short-sited comments spoke to a change that has occurred in Slam poetry
contests which many poets also find annoying. I find it particularly
humorous when the reality is that Bill Kennedy has never (at least to my
knowledge) been present at Slam style poetry readings within "his" city. One
particular reading series, Soul Kitchen, has been extremely open to all
forms of poetry. However, within that group a strong sense of performance is
required. Not antics or entertainment, but a real ability to communicate.
Maybe people should actually engage in this exciting movement (which is
larger than Slam) before forming prejudices.

I realized that Bill Kennedy was in fact probably not William Kennedy, and I
would like to clarify that often people who speak about "Slam Poetry" are
often unaware of the poets involved with the larger movement of poetry.
Sorry for the confusion.

>>7.  Always direct your poem at your parents.  Though you are an angry,

>>8.  Be funny.  Anger wins respect.  Laughter wins slams.  Being funny is

>>(see rule 3).  Having loud sex in your parents¹ basement  with your
>>tatooed
>>ex-boyfriend with eyes to castrating him afterwards is a laugh riot.  See

>>9.  Bring a guitar.  If you remember only one rule about winning slams --
>>this is it.  And if you don¹t have a guitar, find a guitarist and bring
>>them

>>Guaranteed.  The reason is simple -- people like folk singers. They¹ll
>>even
>>pay $15 bucks for a Jewel CD (you can always dream).  The best part of it
>>is
>>that you don¹t even have to know how to write a song! The mere presence of
>>a
>>few chords strumming along with your poem & you¹ll come off sounding like
>>Dylan (if you are a folk singer, however, don¹t make the mistake of
>>singing
>>your songs -- this is the spoken word after all). If you want to top the
>>spoken worders with acoustic guitars, I recommend the addition of a
>>stand-up
>>double-bass.  A walking bassline behind your poem is not only a sure-fire
>>crowd-pleaser, it will add a bluesy feel reminiscent of the Chicago
>>tradition.  To secure this connection, and the streetcred that accompanies
>>it, one needs only to add the phrase ³talkin¹ blues² to the title of your
>>poem and repeat every line in the piece three times, placing a different
>>emphasis every time.  For instance, if your poem is called ³Trainspotting
>>Toilet² and your first line is ³Life is a toilet: no matter how much you
>>flush it you still come up shit.² then  ³The Trainspotting Toilet Talkin¹
>>Blues² will read ³Life is a _toilet_: no matter how much you flush it you
>>still come up shit.  I said, life _is_ a toilet: no matter how much you
>>flush it_ you still come up shit. Yeah, life is a toilet: no matter how
>>much
>>you flush it you still _come up shit_.  You know what I am talking
>>about...²
>>Works every time.  Bring on the prizes.

That sounds right: Bill Kennedy was a minor movie star as a young boy, and
then hosted "Bill Kennedy at the Movies" for many years on Channel 50.
Good to hear "slam poets" are discovering him.

Vernon, I liked your post but:

>Ten or more years ago, you could have a language poet
>(e.g. Edwin Torres) face off against a confessional poet, but I doubt you'd
>find it these days.

Edwin's a language poet? Does he know this? Is this how he is commonly
thought of? I think of him as a very interesting performance-oriented poet
who cut his teeth in the early slam world. _Are_ there still language
poets? I don't even consider the original langpo crowd restrictively
"language"-oriented these days. Didn't that end about 87?

Well, I don't get to control how things are characterized, for sure, but
this surprises me. I do, though, see the contrast you're setting up,
between Edwin's very interesting sonic investigations and fatuous
confessional crap.

Honey http://users.rcn.com/wanda.interport. The New York Foundation for the

both liberated and focused by her resolute trust in the physical idea of
destiny or, as she puts it, =8Cthe randomly falling turns of the universe.=B9
Destiny, here, is at once completely aleatoric, yet ultimately it is the
only trustworthy syntax.  Every detail resonates because no matter how
disparate, they are all similarly aligned."

In the late '80's, early '90's William Kennedy was present at some of the
poetry and, yes, slam events in Albany, namely those at QE2 and the Eighth
Step Coffee House, which is where I met him.

Vernon Frazer isn't crazy to associate Torres with Language. If you choose to believe Language poets don't exist anymore, fair enough. Language-oriented presses do. ROOF Books published the last Torres collection, joining the stable of Silliman, Kit Robinson, Bruce Andrews, Erica Hunt, Charles Bernstein & so on. (This is not a negative thing. I respect & support ROOF, so please- save your defenses for a time when you're really being attacked...by some slam poet, for instance.)

The "Artists=Formerly-Known-As=Language=Poets" flock to Torres when he gives readings. Check one out sometime soon & take a look around. Vernon's not so crazy in his associations.

this topic might be of interest for fc discussion as I find that it's pretty
common to assume I'm talking about ekphrasis when I mention visual poetry,
webpoetry, etc..  There is a chapter on ekphrasis in this book I just
reviewed.  http://www.raintaxi.com/online/2002winter/third_mind.shtml

For my money visual poetry really is a separte and more 'advanced'
undertaking?

Yeah, you're right, and I didn't mean to imply that Vernon was crazy. AND I
have a friend on the edges of the slam world who told me that the slammers
now consider Edwin too -- "experimental" is I believe the word she chose.

I think I have a vested interest in new terms being invented and that old
one being retired. I don't like to think of myself as G2 langpo. But again,
you're right: wishing doesn't make it so, and the L term is probably here
to stay, to refer to virtually any work that pays close attention to
language and is a little paratactic, even though the "project" of language
poetry clearly did come to an end well over a decade ago.

I like this a lot, but I forget my printf format codes, alas, which would

how about:
*your first exposure to poetry (like allen ginsberg's mother taking
him to communist party meetings where everyone sang...)
*a funny misprision (mondegreen) that reveals something about the poetic
your favorite paragraphs about poetry and why
*the first time another poet "spoke" to you from the page
*how you knew you were a poet (jean genet realized he was a writer
when he was writing an xmas card to a patron and thought he'd be
penning the usual holiday pap when he found himself describing the
texture of the paper he was writing on)
*when you realized that your idea of poetry was different from that
of everyone around you...
*an experience with letters coming to life... or words taking on a
life of their own, synesthesiac... etc etc.

One of my current investigations is to situate the "virtual" space of
language on planes other than the flat 2D plane of the printed page and
electron-scanned computer screen. Here is an attempt along these lines,
inspired by the art of Sol Lewitt. It maps a 13-letter word -- one that
contains no letter repetitions -- onto a cube in various stages of
completion.

It is a 130+ page PDF file (150K), so you will have to download to view.
Comments, inquiries welcome.

Frank

Thank you very much for defending me, as well as my sanity. I used the term
"language poet" casually. You can either accept a shorthand term or bog a
discussion down in definitions. I prefer the former.

Torres had his roots in St. Mark's Poetry Project (a.k.a. The Poetry Project
at St. Mark's Church). From my understanding, I believe the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
school evolved out of the New York school in some way. The New York School,
in turn, hung out at the Cedar Tavern, same as many Beat writers, and Black
Mountain poets Creeley and Olson partied with the Beats. None of the lines
between the "camps" are as clearly drawn as some would lead you to believe.
(Three days ago I discovered a book of my earlier "West Coast Beat-Black
Mountain" poetry was in a concrete and visual poetry archive, but my more
recent and more concrete and visual work wasn't. Go figure.)

Today Torres, who (yes) was important in the early days of slam and as a
performance poet, not to mention in his consistently innovative use of
language) would definitely be too "experimental" to read at slams The last
time I read at the Nuyorican, in 1995, the poetry was confessional, and
addressed gangs, drive-bys shootings and AIDS.

Kevin, I don't mean to chop you up. Frankly, I'm looking for more
appropriate descriptive terms myself, since at the moment my poetry seems to
be both post-Beat and post-langpo, and includes other elements for which not
even a shorthand definition has been found. If you find some new labels, I'd
be curious to see what they are so that I can figure out where I fit in
relation to them. Meanwhile, I just do what I do...whatever it's called.
It's the work that's important. The label comes later.

Vernon

Language-oriented presses do. ROOF Books published the last Torres

Erica Hunt, Charles Bernstein & so on. (This is not a negative thing. I

No no. Bill Kennedy was a not-quite-good-enough forward in the
American Hockey League for about 20 years in the fifties and sixties.
He once scored 12 goals and 22 assists in a single season for the
Cleveland Barons.

It's the phrase "face off" that I'm thinking of here. I dislike poets that
face off with other poets. I really wish Slam Poetry would call itself
something else, something without the word poetry . . . in much the
same way that I dislike it when people make arguments that lyrics to
songs are poetry, I dislike it when people say that Slam Poetry is
poetry. I think it's something else. Something that when the words are
taken from their context (put in a book, say) they lose much of their
interest and power.

So, rather than say "down with slam poetry", I'll just say, it's not
_poetry_ , it's something else. And something I don't care for all that
much.

i suggest you have a very narrow print-centric view of poetry. if pressed,
you would probably even prefer the silent reading of poetry from a book as
the only valid experience of poetry.
i suggest poetry (which i believe is a virtual, immaterial thing) has many
material forms, one of them being slam.
i suggest that using slam as a standard to measure all poetry is as
misguided as using print published poetry to measure all poetry.
i suggest you might like to read katherine hayles' new book, 'writing
machines', or jerome mcgann's 'radiant textuality' which deal with other
material representations of literature in this post-Cyber age, and how the
cyber age forced us to rethink our previously held conceptions of literature.

If you're into the French poetry'painting evolution, there's a good
book that attempts to cover it, _Peinture et Poésie: Le Dialogue par le
livre 1874-2000_, by Yves Peyré, Gallimard, 2001.  There's no
American equivalent to my knowledge.

I think Tom Bell's point is helpful.  Ekphrasis is its own can of worms,
and brings with it questions of mimesis and competition between the
arts I find grow tired.  Visual poetry (or whatever one calls it)
doesn't assume it knows a difference between the arts.  The idea of
the gesture as a link between drawing/writing is more 'advanced' or
exploratory from a creative perspective---maybe to the point of being
'primitive.'

Gabe,

You're right on the nose. There are poetic forms built on the very idea of
competition, each poet topping some one else's line? Aren't  collaborations
(particularly of early new york school, Ted Berrigan, etal) variations on
competitive poetry?

By thje way, Anselm Berrigan gave a great reading yesterday at the Poetry
Project, particularly the first section of "One Star Hotel."

Patrick, a few comments for you.

Maybe it is indecorous to talk about one's own work, but your rejoinder,
Patrick, to the student paper that savaged my book crutched hard on the
idea that A Defense of Poetry employs irony, that its titles and presumably
the rest of the words in the book ring ironic. If I may, this is a wrong
reading. You cannot read my book that way. It is not your book, it is my
book, and you may not read it that way! :) I explain: The book is and is
about cruelty and is not an organ of liberal irony. Irony, no; but features
of Mineppean satire and the grotesque, yes: burlesque, lampoon, mock
heroic, invective. But it is in no way ironic. To read the book as ironic
is to agree that "Gabe really doesn't mean all that stuff about Robert
Duncan, the HUAC hearings, violence, farts and his buttocks; he's really
just kidding." Occam Occam? I am not kidding. I am ridiculing. The
difference between kidding around and ridicule is kinda large.

Nor am I joining the "Diss Irony" bandwagon, though the following ride upon
it: 1. David Foster Wallace has laid in against irony (calling it an
instrument of "great despair and stasis"); 2. A book by Jedediah Purdy (For
Common Things: Irony, Trust, and Commitment in American Today [Knopf])
argues that irony disables genuine feeling and trust; and 3. Ron Silliman
has at least tried to rescue one writer from the avant and post-avant
ironic wash via his blog.

I say I'm not on that bandwagon because the Lack of Irony in my book is not
reformative. I don't mean to be pompous when I say that the book seeks to
reform nothing. The poems in the book "mean what they say," which is often
"go f--- yourself." The book is not Seinfeld. It is not about the
liberating inadequacies of language. In fact, A Defense of Poetry opposes
the ironic strongly. If irony can be said to "have a failure," it is that
irony seems to suggest the only alternative to itself is bathos -- in the
mundane sense of a language too rich with feeling. Am I wrong in assuming
the school of irony suggests that transgression and complete freedom from
conventions of language are the only alternatives to sentimentality? There
are other alternatives, my book suggests: like, try feeling. Not bathetic
feeling, not suffering, not soul-making, but feeling. Try, maybe, enduring.

So, it froths me a little that you, who say you like the book, would dare
to call it irony. My book is about a failure to feel with and from
language, a failure that is so deeply woven into current books that
anything suggesting alternatives to irony is considered reactionary and/or
sentimental. The book is asking you to feel its dismissal of that
notion--and not merely the concomitant petulancies of your average
disjunctive poet. Are there no other alternatives to reason and the poetry
of soul-making and suffering than irony and its threadbare, "transgressive"
displays against convention, meaning, and reason?

This is not about going past some new edge of language into wilds or polis
unknown but about remembering that the anarchic and the purposeful fuck in
a bush called satire. Which is to say that the book like this is not about
aestheticism alone (language and form) but about "life" and content too.
When I say the book is "about" something, I mean to imply that it has a
content.

The book in other words is not "cool." Jennifer Moxley is cool. Keston
Sutherland is cool. Gary Sullivan is cool. Ekphrasis is cool.

To sum up, there is nothing ironic about the book and there is nothing
honest about the book. It is merely a book that ridicules a lack of
feeling. (For instance, one feeling whose absence is ridiculed in the book
is Shame: the failure to feel shame is righteousness. Another feeling whose
absence is ridiculed is pity: the failure to feel pity is pomposity). That
student said my book was stupid, you said my book was smart, and I'm saying
my book is ridiculing and mean. Read my book correctly: it is about
incorrectitude. It is a mean and cruel book whose purpose is to raise a
sympathy for enduring. Please read it that way.

Thanks, Patrick.

And let's not forget Loki's Quarrel, in the Poetic Edda, which is filled
with wonderful slams, like: "Be silent, Freyia, you're a witch / and much
imbued with malice, you were astride your brother, all the laughing gods
surprised you, / and then, Freyia, you farted."

Yes, Willard is great on visual poetry. Check out his new Rise of
Surrealism : Cubism, Dada, and the Pursuit of the Marvelous (2002) and
Apollinaire, Visual Poetry, and Art Criticism (1993). Both are very
interesting.

Can you let us know W Bohn's publisher(s). He does sound interesting.

what do you think? Please mark a mental note of your immediate answer to
the question in my subject line and then keep reading.

I'd like to ask for assistance in focussing some ideas, if I may. Many
of the posters to this list write computer-code-based poetry or have
things to say about it. Computer code is not exactly what I'm interested
in, but I'm wondering what the larger context for that might be (what
kind of poetry is it?), without expanding the boundaries of context to
infinity: does it, for example, bear a relation to Oulipian practice?
Lipograms? What about anagrams? The project that was just posted by
Jeffrey Jullich in which the audiobook was fed through MS Word's voice
recognition software? Kenneth Goldsmith's collection of mondegreens or
his project in which he wrote down everything he said for a week? Darren
Wershler-Henry's experiments with spam-bot poisoner program text? I know
this is a pretty wide net, but what I see linking all these things is
the poet giving up a degree of her/his control (actually, mostly _his_,
it seems: I'd like to have some examples of women writing this way) in
favour of some program or automated procedure, whether it is a set of
rules (more restrictive than the rules of sonnets or haiku) or
machinery... Is it reasonable to lump these things together? And if so
would programmatic poetry be a fair name? Would conceptual poetry strike
closer to the mark? Process-oriented? There is always a process, but in
these projects the process is highlighted.

Any lipogrammatic or anagrammatic writer must face the question of
whether a computer might not be more able to efficiently produce such
texts, which are largely defined by the lexicon or paradigm available
and by the syntactical constraints imposed — in other words, texts which
are essentially the product of programs. Here's a quote from Christian
Bök —author of the Oulipo-influenced Eunoia — "We may exalt the poets of
the future, not because they can write great poems, but because they can
program devices that can write great poems for us." (ubuweb) I don't
think he was talking about code. Oulipo+cyber-poetry=? Other examples?

I'd appreciate your thoughts about these questions, or tell me why you
think they are not the right questions.

George Bowering, the Canadian Laureate in gold trunks in the far corner
comes in with a slam against slam- GS slams back for slam- another slam
against George's slam against slam from Parrishka with a veritable tidal
wave of punches on favor of slam in a brilliant strategic proto match from
Bill Kennedy- Sherlock groans, swaying against the outside ropes- Frazier
calls foul- Ian Van Heusen comes in for a hard slam against Bill Kennedy
-and the question is who is Bill Kennedy anyway?- Ian pulls back on his
second punch-Bill Kennedy is, in fact, not William Kennedy- Golumbia in for
a foul call from outside the ring- Bill Kennedy was, in fact, a minor movie
star from the 50's, good for the slam poets for discovering him- and now its
another Canadian heavyweight, Kevin Davies in with a sharp poetics
terminology punch at Vernon Frazier- Truscott calls foul-Bill Kennedy is, in
fact, Bill Kennedy of Toronto-Gerald Schwartz comes back with another
clarification-

Sherlock calls foul on the- language- punch... and it's the Vancouver victor
Davies back from outside the ring...he's clarifying his language poetics
punch- Bowering comes back from the ropes with a foul call- Vernon Frazier
in there for a clinch with Davies -Bowering back with a sideways slam on
clarifications and now its Gallaher calling foul on slam terminology-
Komminos comes out of the close corner with a real heavy print clarification
slam at Gallaher -and folks- this is amazing- here comes Gudding from the
close corner in red trunks with a mighty slam in favor of universal slam
poetry... ladies and gentleman its looking like slam is looking pretty good-
oops here comes Nudel slamming slam- Murat slams another slam in favor of
Gudding and the great Northern Laureate Bowering is on the ropes- waiting to
hear from the poetry prince of Canada folks-and its Pierre Joris- the Albany
bard hitting hard for slam...

Shakespeare & Marlowe squaring it off for the $ favors of a noble

Do we have a comment from Bowering? Yes- yes...he's back in the ring

what a game... So who says poetics poets can't slam with the best of
'em...what a fight...what a match...slam poetics at the top of its form...a

seems a bad translation of 'recuperable':  last laugh for a slow dance.  the
most beer will float away the prize.  and i hope it is a raft.  dodge that.
southern climbs make amazing monkeys dance and dangle and if you could only
tap dance the best...  convince us...  that is talent?  you win.  again,
tangential to deciduous impermanence.  such an ever green winter as ours.
where one minute you need your coat and the next your friends are out
jogging.  code work is an excuse, or at the very least a new car.  let us
all find one in some ditch, fix it up and show it off for our friends.
though, most of mine are computer programs.  even they can hold their
liquour better than that damn albatross i found strapped to my mailbox.  and
then we're supposed to give it all up for offices.  a shame that channels
can't read snuff.  welcome back.  it has been so long without a warm fire
and some biscuits.  salley up.  we'll write better than any sort of
cockatoo.  hoo hoo.  my kingdom for a horse.  ah poetics...

There are a lot of things which irk me about this thread so far, so I
have some questions. First though, I was really gladdened to see
G.Gudding's post on the long history of poetry "competition"- thanks for
that. I'd add that I find it naïve to suppose that yer regular
contemporary poetry reading is free of competitiveness itself, as if
people just don't care who the better poets are: "we're all winners,
after all." Now, I think a lot of slam poetry is pretty unsophisticated
(a lot of fiction is unsophisticated too, but I don't expect it to find
another name for itself), but I find that some of the comments here
reveal a rather unsophisticated understanding of poetry slams. I doubt
that any slam poets do it for the money, and I don't even think they do
it to win the competition. Perhaps they do it because it has an
audience, one that doesn't only consist of other poets. And while some
slam poets may be a little over-earnest about it these days, I think
it's important to understand that the slam is a show, it's a
choreographed performance in which all the "competitors" co-conspire.
You have to give slam poets credit for recognizing that poetry is not
really about competition; that part of it is a gimmick. It has always
been that way, since the form was conceived in the 80's. (Check out "An
Incomplete History of the Slam" http://www.e-poets.net/library/slam/).
This was before my time, but apparently Anne Waldman and Ted Berrigan
staged a "poetry bout" dressed up in boxing gear back in 1979. The
costumes, of course, were in jest, but the poetry was not. H. Nudel sort
of hit on this when he posted that slams are to poetry as pro. wrestling
is to violence, except that's not quite right: you might say slams are
to poetry as pro wrestling is to dance.

Another mildly irksome thing is the conflation of poetry slams and
spoken word, which Bill Kennedy definitely does and which CBC quotes Mr.
Laureate G. Bowering as doing. Mr. Bowering, I have a lot of respect for
your writing and yourself, but did you really say (I can't find the
original Globe and Mail article, can someone post a link?) that "poetry
as performance is crude and extremely revolting" as a Globe
letter-writer says you did? You're not serious, are you? As for Mr.
Kennedy, can anyone take that seriously? It may be on the mark with
regards to some slam poets (who are often practically teenagers, let's
be frank, so lay off), but it's just a dumb parody, not even funny, and
seems to have a pretty fuzzy grasp of what a poetry slam is, even. What
I was saying though, is that spoken word, as I understand it, is a much
bigger field than just poetry slams. In Montreal, which is where I am
from, there is a thriving bilingual performance-literature scene, with
an enthusiastic audience that calls the form by the name "spoken word"
mostly without embarassment, and there hasn't been a slam there in
years. I was a bit disappointed when I realized that "spoken word" has
such negative connotations in the US, and is often conflated with slams.
Now I see that there are plenty of Canadians who have the same glossary.
So my question is, and I really want to know, what do you think spoken
word means? Doesn't it encompass a large range of poetry
performance/storytelling? But it's not just poetry performed at a
reading, though, is it? Does it make a difference if the work is
memorized? And what do you call the work of people like Edwin Torres, or
Emily XYZ, or "Swifty Lazarus", or Willie Perdomo, or Sheri D. Wilson,
or even Spalding Grey, or Karen Finley, and why not spoken word? I'm
sorry to harp on another question of nomenclature.

And sorry to be so verbose about two things in one night.

Kingsley Amis & co. Not my cup of tea as a poet, but an influential

And Susan Howe's work with the manuscripts of Charles Sanders Peirce -- his
doodlings (the more representational ones being surrealist renderings of
the face [especially the nose]), drawings, formulae (some like concrete
poetry), sentences, apothegms, paragraphs. Peirce's handwriting is truly
beautiful: he used a broad flexible nib, generally. I can't remember but I
think there were text-reproductions (photographs?) in Howe's
_Pierce-Arrow_, but I recall thinking that the repros were *too small, the
book's trim was too small for the images. Maybe I'm misunderremembering the
book (don't have it here with me). But I saw her lecture on the mss at
Cornell about three years ago. She used two huge screens 20' by 30' to
display his work.

There's been a series going for a lot of years at Scottsdale Center for the
Arts, begun by Sheila Murphy (& still organized by her?) that asks poets to
respond to specific visual works of art.

I don't know whether the works Ron talks about here are that sort that
you're looking for, i.e. poems that are inspired by or respond to specific
works of visual art, or, rather, real "collaborations," where poet/artist
are making something together. The latter would also be the case with
Fool's Gold, by Bernstein/Bee, from Chax Press. But part of this
collaboration, and possibly a few of these, adds the work of the book
maker(s) to the collaboration, which then becomes about the total book, not
either the work of art or the text separately. This last area is something
Granary has worked at for several years, as has Chax, in our own ways.
Sometimes, yes, the text responds to the work of art, sometimes it's the
other way around, and sometimes the nature of the collaboration is more
complex than either of those two possibilities.

Sorry, I forwarded a report from CBC on your article about slam poets in the Globe and Mail. Should have pointed people to
the original article. (I think they can find it if they do a search at the Globe and Mail website.) Well, at least you're still
controversial, even at second hand!

Yes, Gabe, I agree. I think that's a New Directions book. "Through a glass
darkly" typifies most of their current design/production value. (The
typography of ND Books up into the early Sixties is usually something to
relish. Compare the original edition of Personae with the emaciated current
one.) In those earlier books, the design and typography are not always on
target with the poetry, but at least it's fresh & muscular to the eye.
Images of art are the last thing ND handles well - the reproduction of
Pierce's original script and drawings are certainly a blur of the original.
Contemporary repro and printing can be so incredibly good; it seems to me
inexcusable how blind-eyed some publishers can be when it comes to rendering
the original with something that come real close to rendering or mirroring
the punch of the original work. But maybe some are satisfied with "the idea"
of the work rather than its material quality/character. (Or is the subset of
that approach a fear of making "graven images"?)  Then again, for some
publishers it might just be time & money - the only way the book is going to
get done is to do it on the cheap. But when work merits the visual
attention, what a loss.

Sadly true. New Directions production values were never close to =
adequate, much less venturesome or even representatively careful, with =
respect to artwork or visual poems. The several Patchen picture poem =
volumes are awful in their misrepresentation of his poetry's inspired =
contrasts--dark and murky books in the context of KP's articulately =
colorful papers and palette, acrylic noodlings and the luminous values =
of his vispo compositions.

For the interested, check out Derek Stanford's ekphrastic THE VISION & =
DEATH OF AUBREY BEARDSLEY (Redcliffe, 1985). Graphically sensitive, well =
designed, tinged with yellow.

Ron's Googlism results for "Bill Kennedy" brought to my mind a Flarf piece
on Gary Sullivan I did a little over a year ago (using just plain Google).
I thought it was worth posting because--well, just because everyone really
should know more about Gary Sullivan.

------

The Gary Sullivan Files


At present, Gary Sullivan is making loud banging noises between Clark
Coolidge and Gertrude Stein, and much more.  Jordan Davis suggests Gary
Sullivan "should quit his day job and become the Lester Bangs of poetry."
Gary Sullivan will be moving on to new endeavors.

11:30am: "At Home with Gary Sullivan."  From leaky faucets to refinishing
your deck, Gary Sullivan is the home handy man on the radio!  No matter how
big or small the job, Gary's expertise and knowledge promises an emotional
experience from "innocence to heaven" (this after Gary Sullivan has spotted
the problem).

Gary Sullivan is a partner in the International Section of Haynes and
Boone's Dallas office.  Mr. Sullivan focuses his practice on foreign
investment and motion vector resolution, filter-tap number and
profiles/levels as well as the direct versus subsequent filtering issue.
With a focus on using the NT Performance Monitor (Perfmon) tool, Gary
Sullivan has organized his "White Paper" into three major sections:
Television in Ireland, Sex Education, Mental Health.  Currently Gary
Sullivan is the President and Rick Suder is the Executive Vice President.
Clifton is Assistant Chief of the department, and Bruce's son, Jimmy, is
Chief.  Bruce's son-in-law, Gary Sullivan, is a firefighter for the
department, too.  Three volunteer firefighters were promoted earlier this
month.  Gary Sullivan was made a Captain and David Williams Jr. and James
Madden are now Lieutenants.  When he became Chairman of the Board, Gary
Sullivan then became President, replacing Anderson with plumbing pipes
overhead to a unisex rest room.  Gary Sullivan is chairing the group.

Gary Sullivan is a solo-practitioner located in Little Rock, Arkansas.  He
is alcoholic and beats his wife.  Philomena Rostovich is a single mother;
Gary Sullivan is gay.

Scene: back room at Sullivan's saloon where Gary inserts Jesse's key and
Eleanor is forcing her to have sex with him ... find a guy hu will kiss me
an' want a sex life, i want sum1 hu cares 4 me! Sum1, any1....  Gary bursts=
.

OKALOOSA--On Tuesday afternoon, the submarine-armed freshman Gary Sullivan
was playing it right on the ragged edge of disaster.

"I have liked one shining star and that is Judge Gary Sullivan.  In his las=
t
election he gave money back to the unions and police, now sex offender
experts."

Gary Sullivan is the Male Sessional Worker and work 6 hours per week.
Cooperating attorney Gary Sullivan is also investigating what appears to be
a pattern of police abuse against gay men in live two-hour show with
excellent local sales potential.  South Wales Police Detective Inspector
Gary Sullivan said his team were already refinishing your deck.  Gary
Sullivan is the home handy man.

12pm: "At Home with Gary Sullivan" is a direct compliment to "Better Lawns
and Gardens."  "At Home" features 20-year veteran contractor Gary Sullivan.
Gary has income of $6,500 and maximum expenses of $5,000.

10:00pm-Midnight: Gary Sullivan was on hand to see that everyone was fed ..=
.
all week long.  Gary (Sullivan) talented drummer/graphics guy has ...
thunder!  My too small helmet!  Fuck rock man--just lemme loop....  Guitar
solo was HOT, as performed by the crazy guitarman, FLASH!!  Lige held the
bottom down with some mo' funky bass as Gary Sullivan did some tight
drumming!!  Mark Hunkeberry managed to arrange for the Minorcan Delight and
added that Gary Sullivan was the main recipient of the sheepshead attention=
,
and it was sheepshead that caught George Zajewski's eyes.

ST. PETERSBURG=8BGary Sullivan has a dream.  "Why not have a publicly finance=
d
skate park," asked Sullivan, owner of the city's only downtown skateboard
shop.  Kelly Edwards asked if Gary Sullivan could put up a cell tower.  He
said he would be opposed to a cell tower.  "Just tearing it up," said Gary
Sullivan.  The skateboard "stoke," Sullivan said, did not discriminate.
Age, sex, race or creed ... it got a Japanese sex magazine into trouble by
putting 29-year-old housemate Gary Sullivan into a $44,000-per-year job.
Charles Heinonen said Gary Sullivan has obtained his building permit and
cannot have his house and a tower at the same time.

Gary Sullivan is the Male Sessional Worker and work 6 hours per week.  Gary
is currently in his show, is written by and stars Gary Sullivan.  It is
described as "innocent by force of nature ... free range sex is absolutely
taboo."  Road bikes are sexy again.  In a big way.  Work centers around Gar=
y
Sullivan and his merry kiwi band ... again is verrry appealing.

As Gary Sullivan's radio and TV exposure has expanded, Al Dickson (a
Bellevue man accused of having sex with two teen-age girls) becomes a free
agent.  Miguel Sagmoen has been released.  Rudy Gainer has been released.
Gary Sullivan has been released.  Jacob Daniels, Harry Trent, and Gary
Sullivan went into the Florida woods for a camping trip two weeks ago.
Their bodies were found two days ago.

Gary Sullivan is the Male Sessional Worker and work 6 hours per week.  Gary
covers one afternoon during the week plus the Saturday sessions.  Gary is
currently in his building ... best-managed in the company.  Is yours?  Even
a communicator can love Gary Sullivan.

Gary Sullivan is a Sessional Worker and work 6 hours per week.  Check out
this Tomb Raider!  Too sexy!  You can trust Gary's advice, and can call him
for answers to your questions.  The author helps you....

much less venturesome or even representatively careful, with respect to

I suspect that had Laughlin been beginning now, it would be different. After
all, he was always willing to take risks, aesthetically and politically,
with talented writers. We do what we can when we can. I don't think he
should be faulted for this.

I believe the quote from "Loki's Quarrel" was claiming that the goddess
Freyja farted in the middle of an incestuous sex act. No, that isn't
extremely nice. But if I walked up to, for example, Steve Case, and said,
"Steve, you were astride your sister, and then, Steve, you farted," he
would get mad, but not die. (Nor would, by way of collateral damage, his
offended sister.) If you could actually kill things with verbal violence,
every Windows computer I have ever been forced to work on would have
exploded. (Intel... Intel... no mas.)

POG
presents

poets Rachel DuPlessis and Frances Sjoberg

Saturday, January 18, 7pm
Dinnerware Gallery, 135 East Congress
Admission: $5; Students $3


Additional Event: Rachel DuPlessis will present a paper, "Manhood and its
Poetic Projects: the construction of USA masculinity in the counter-cultural
poetry of the 1950s,” on Friday, January 17, at 2pm, Modern Language room
451, at the university; this event is free and open to the public (for
directions phone POG at 615-7803).  (C0-sponsored by UA English & Arizona
Quarterly.)

Rachel DuPlessis, Professor of English at Temple University, is known as a
feminist critic and scholar with a special interest in modern and
contemporary poetry, and as a poet and essayist. In 2001, she published two
books: Genders, Races, and Religious Cultures in Modern American Poetry,
1908-1934 (Cambridge, 2001), a work of literary criticism, and Drafts 1-38,
Toll (Wesleyan University Press, 2001), a collection of her long poems.
Between 1980 and 1998, she published six other books of poetry and two
chapbooks. DuPlessis is also the author of Writing Beyond the Ending:
Narrative Strategies of Twentieth-Century Women Writers (1985), H.D.: The
Career of that Struggle (1986), both from Indiana University Press, and The
Pink Guitar: Writing as Feminist Practice (Routledge, 1990). She is the
editor of The Selected Letters of George Oppen (Duke University Press,
1990). DuPlessis has also published three coedited anthologies, reflecting
her interests in feminism, gender issues in modernism, socially-inflected
readings of poetry, and the poetics of contemporary poetry. These are The
Objectivist Nexus: Essays in Cultural Poetics, with Peter Quartermain, from
the University of Alabama Press (1999); The Feminist Memoir Project: Voices
from Women's Liberation, with Ann Snitow, from Three Rivers/Crown (1998);
and Signets: Reading H.D., with Susan Stanford Friedman, from the University
of Wisconsin Press (1990). DuPlessis's work in poetry and in the essay form
has been discussed in recent books by Lynn Keller, Burton Hatlen, Hank
Lazer, and others. In 1990, DuPlessis held a Pennsylvania Council on the
Arts grant for poetry, and in 1993, was honored by the Fund for Poetry. She
received Temple University's Creative Achievement Award in 1999. In 2002,
DuPlessis was awarded the third Roy Harvey Pearce / Archive for New Poetry
Prize, given biennially to an American poet/scholar who has made a
significant lifetime contribution to American poetry and literary
scholarship. In 2002 she was awarded a Pew Fellowship in the Arts for her
work in poetry.

Frances Sjoberg was born in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan in 1973. She received
a B.A. from the University of Arizona in 1994 and an M.F.A. from Warren
Wilson College in 2002. She serves as an ad-hoc member of the Board of
Directors for Kore Press, a non-profit literary arts press. Her publications
include poetry and critical writing in "spork," "Sonora Review," and "88: A
Journal of Contemporary American Poetry." Currently, Sjoberg lives in Tucson
where she organizes events and outreach programs for the University of
Arizona Poetry Center.

Hi Folks,

Because I'm such a dedicated follower of fashion, I've decided that I too
need a blog. One that will document the process/progress of my current
writing project. Read it if you want, it's out there.

Well, if you would so presume, you would be wrong. Pressed or un-
pressed, I consider the words on the page to be instructions for a
verbal preformance. So there. Nyah nyah.

As well, I should add that, though I don't much care for Poetry Slams,
I like some Spoken Word art. I just don't think it works well when
divorced from its context, usually. Spoken Word seems to be best
when spoken by its author. I can't usually follow its instructions if I
attempt to replicate it by reading it myself (aloud or silently). If this is
my failing or not, what it means for me is I don't end up owning much
of it.

In a related but different case, I find Poetry Slams to be mostly glitz.
Which is fine, glitz is fun, but I find myself usually not in that mood.

Data stored in multiplying bacteria

11:02 08 January 03

NewScientist.com news service

A message encoded as artificial DNA can be stored within the genomes of
multiplying bacteria and then accurately retrieved, US scientists have
shown.

Their concern that all current ways of storing information, from paper to
electronic memory, can easily be lost or destroyed prompted them to devise
a new type of memory - within living organisms.

"A big concern is the protection of valuable information in the case of a
nuclear catastrophe," says information technologist Pak Chung Wong, of the
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington State. The laboratory
was set up as a nuclear energy research institute.

A similar catastrophe strikes the US in the cult television series Dark
Angel, in which a colossal electromagnetic pulse wipes out the electronic
infrastructure. "Bacteria may be an inexpensive and stable long-term means
of data storage," Wong told New Scientist.


Small world


The scientists took the words of the song It's a Small World and translated
it into a code based on the four "letters" of DNA. They then created
artificial DNA strands recording different parts of the song. These DNA
messages, each about 150 bases long, were inserted into bacteria such as E.
coli and Deinococcus radiodurans.

The latter is especially good at surviving extreme conditions, says Wong.
It can tolerate high temperatures, desiccation, ultraviolet light and
ionising radiation doses 1000 times higher than would be fatal to humans.

The beginning and end of each inserted message have special DNA tags
devised by the scientists. These "sentinels" stop the bacteria from
identifying the message as an invading a virus and destroying it, says
Wong.

"The magic of the sentinel is that it protects the information, so that
even after a hundred bacterial generations we were able to retrieve the
exact message," says Wong. "Once the DNA message is in bacteria, it is
protected and can survive." And as a millilitre of liquid can contain up to
billion bacteria, the potential capacity of such a memory system is
enormous.


Spontaneous mutations


Deinococcus is adapted to survive in extreme conditions and is consequently
very good at repairing any mutations that spontaneously arise in its DNA
code. But Huw Williams, a bacteriologist at Imperial College, London, says
that the small size of the inserted messages makes it no surprise that they
survive 100 generations intact.

Williams thinks a greater danger than mutations changing the message is
that they could make some bugs better adapted to their environment than
others. So far, Wong and colleagues have kept the different message
colonies separate, but in future they aim to retrieve messages from a mixed
colony.

"If you grow the colonies indefinitely, less well-adapted bacteria may be
lost over time," he says. "The question is whether you will be able to
retain all your message populations. But this is intriguing work and very
forward looking."

Direwood


Suddenly they've slipped our flank: red foxes.
Stumbling, hungover, wobbly as fresh foals.

Whiskey-breathed, delirious creatures, hot
Eyes and ears, circling to sniff fingers in shake.

Out their jackknives will streak, our cold leather
Will be theirs tonight. Half moon for a jester.

Owls whoop, having assembled, puffing at wet
Camels, ready to catch our late show's curtains.

Leaves report our sweating as metronome-steady
Crunch, calm as harvest's gust. Does whistle

From slick embraces, rattling at antler in a fever.
Glass snap, clearly hoof to vial. So quivers blood

In each direction, mostly rising. Beneath the pines
Saliva rises like rough laughter, from the spinning gut.

Cole's book is a gem--

In a less directly always kind of way,
look at Carol Snow's book "For" in terms of relationship between art and

Jonathan Williams owns several original Patchen painting/poems, gifts i believe.  and they're truly some of the most original magic you can lay your eyes on.  but to fault New Directions for the reproduction quality is to not look at how dedicated Laughlin was to making poet/artists like Patchen available and affordable to the world.  there are some pricey reproductions of his work you can buy, if you're rich, but New Directions did an amazing job with the resources available to them at the time.  we are talking about the publishing business from nearly half a century ago let's not forget.

it's definitely fun and little thought-provoking but
not "the most exciting new poet" etc.

it reminds me more of the "novel-writing machines"
from "1984."






__ ____

Googlism is possibly the most exciting new poet to
emerge in recent
months,
its index style, reminiscent of Walt Whitman, and
drawing on a
collective
data base of the web creates poetry suited to
performance and the page.
Undoubtedly through updates and version revisions we
will see the young
googlism mature into a poet of canonic importance in
the literatures of
the
world.
The pleasure of the rapid response googlism is able to
give us,
reverses
the dynamic between reader and poem. The reader does
not ask 'what does
this poem say to me?' but rather, 'what can i ask this
poem to say?'
It is
not a question of whether the author is dead, but more
a question of
'who
the fuck is the author?'

is, please send work to: <shankarr@ccsu.edu>. More
details follow:

I'm helping put together a major anthology of East
Asian, South Asian and Middle Eastern poetry and would
be very happy to consider your work. If you're
interested in contributing,  we ask that you send us a
suite of work (3-5 poems) for possible inclusion in
the anthology by January 30, 2002 (the sooner the
better however).

Also, I'm not plugged into the literary community in
the Indian Subcontinent and I wonder if you could
forward this message to any suitable authors, writing
in any language that has been or will be translated
into English. This is a great opportunity and I want
this to be as reflective as possible of the many
directions South Asian writing is moving in.

There are a few caveats, however, including the fact
that we have not been allotted a permissions budget.
Therefore we ask that you send us previously
unpublished poems or poems for which you own
reproduction rights (as both a MS Word document and
pasted into the body of the email). If you have a
relationship with your publisher, you should find out
whether we might use a particular poem without charge.
Ultimately we hope to field the most vital possible
collection and we thank you in advance for your
helping us insure this.

Please also include a brief bio and contact
information. As the process progresses, we will be in
touch regarding the shape and trajectory of the
collection. We are also striving to procure some
percentage of royalties for the contributors and will
keep you appraised of such discussions. Irrespective
of financial renumeration, we believe this collection
marks an important moment in poetics and in furthering
the ongoing dialogue that members of cultures too
often unheard have with the larger population. Our
singular goal now as editors is to get this anthology
out and we appreciate your expedient attention to this
message. Please refer to the anthology overview below
for more information. We look forward to seeing your
work.

Best,

Anthology Overview:

The current moment has proved to be a paradoxical one
for American poetry, as more writers and readers of
poetry exist than at any other time, while it could be
argued that the overall significance of poetry has
dwindled with the emergence of other media. In
actuality, the internet has replenished the
tributaries of poetry with wide-ranging international
contributions, creating audiences where before there
was no dialogue. One such germinal community is that
of Asian and Middle Eastern poets who have experienced
a fertile period of growth over the course of the last
few decades in America.

If current events have any distillable moral, it is
that we share our planet with those who have different
visions and identities than we have, and that it is
incumbent upon us as responsible citizens to learn
about those differences. Parallel to the development
of poetics in America – the sweeping trajectory from
formalism to confessionalism to language poetry –
diverse poetics have also flourished in Eastern
countries. The masterly work of Mahmood Darwish, Bei
Dao, Yi Sang, and Nai Kahani, to name a few, provides
insights that transcend any narrowly defined strata of
culture or time, and luckily for us, their poems have
been translated into English, allowing us access to
the spiritual and secular reports of which they are
harbinger.

The mission of Risen From East is to show that the
intellectual and cultural forces that have washed over
the West have also had reverberation in the East,
creating multifarious poets who rewrite tradition
while broadening the scope of American literature,
both in English and in translation. This anthology
will showcase a comprehensive selection of established
writers and emerging voices from many different parts
of the East and writers of Eastern descent.

A little the verse for wear

Winning awards, wowing live audiences and producing Canada's first nationa=
l laureate, West Coast poets have had a banner
year. But don't think that means they like each other -- or even the publi=
city, writes ALEXANDRA GILL


By ALEXANDRA GILL




Wednesday, January 1, 2003 =96 Page R1


VANCOUVER -- In a dark, candle-lit caf=E9 in Vancouver, DJ DutchBoy fades =
out the jazzy groove, as a modern-day hepcat in
a slicked-back pompadour bounds onto the tiny stage.

"What do we need?" the emcee asks.

"Passion!" the crowd shouts back.

"We need passion . . . " is just how T. Paul Ste. Marie begins his poem, w=
hich as it unfolds pays homage to the "manic minds" of
the "literary lowstick limbo" who paved "the wagon-train ruts with gluts o=
f tarry-thick ideas" for the next generation of "word-
play sensationalists like us."

On this particular Sunday night, more than 100 people have piled into the =
Montmartre Caf=E9 on Main Street to hear and watch
an assortment of poets, spoken-word artists, slam performers and musicians=
 strut their stuff.

Not a bad draw. Then again, this eclectic open-mike series, called Thunder=
ing Word Heard, has attracted a capacity crowd
almost every Sunday night for the past two years -- and is just one of the=
 dozens of regular poetry readings, slam contests
(which are influenced by the duelling nature of rap) and spoken -word caba=
rets that take place all over the city.

And this "lowstick limbo" is child's play compared to the city's loftier l=
iterary-poetry scene. This fall, Vancouver writer George
Bowering was named Canada's first parliamentary poet laureate. A week befo=
re that, Bowering's friend, Roy Miki, won the
Governor-General's Award for poetry, in a year when three of the five nomi=
nees hailed from Vancouver.

Earlier this year, Aislinn Hunter (Into the Early Hours) won the Gerald La=
mpert Memorial Award from the League of Canadian
Poets for the best first book of poetry published in Canada. Heather Spear=
s, meanwhile, won the league's Pat Lowther
Memorial Award for Required Reading, a book of verse and drawings inspired=
 by the Reena Virk murder case.

There was also Karen Solie, nominated for the prestigious Griffin Prize fo=
r Short Haul Engine, her first book of poetry, written
while she lived in Victoria. Even further afield, Vancouver's Billeh Nicke=
rson was nominated for the  New York-based
Publishing Triangle Gay Men's Poetry Prize.

So is there any correlation between the groundswell of so-called "street p=
oetry" in Vancouver and the West Coast's domination
of all those august literary prizes?

"Horseshit," Bowering sputters in protest, going on to curse spoken-word a=
rtists and slams as "abominations."

So what if Vancouver has become one of the hottest venues on the North Ame=
rican spoken-word circuit? Or that it's the only
Canadian city to compete in the International Slam Championships (with Van=
couverite Shane Koyczan winning the title in 2000).

Bowering couldn't give a toot. Real poets, he insists, bow to language wit=
h humility. "To treat poetry as performance is crude
and extremely revolting," says Bowering -- somewhat akin, he adds, to "dog=
s who walk on their hind feet." And he doesn't think
his confrontational attitude to those on the lower rungs of his craft is u=
nbecoming of a poet laureate. "Poetry does better when
poets are arguing," he explains, "because in order to argue decently, you'=
ve got to do some thinking."

Esta Spalding, who arrived in Vancouver from Toronto almost six years ago,=
 agrees that the poetry community here is vibrant.
But she also says that it's too fragmented to find any sense of scene.

"It almost feels unmappable," says Spalding, a poet, fiction writer and co=
 editor of Brick magazine, as well as senior story
producer on the CTV drama, The Eleventh Hour. "And that's what I like abou=
t it. There are so many extraordinary poets writing
here, and everybody is pursuing it in their own way."

Indeed, if you were to try mapping the West Coast poetry scene, you'd have=
 to draw a dividing line not just between the
spoken-word and literary poets, but also between the Vancouver poets and t=
he much more cohesive Vancouver Island
community of poets.

"We don't pay much attention to [Vancouver poets]," says Patrick Lane, who=
 might be considered the godfather of the fiercely
independent Island mob. "But we never have," adds Lane, who says the ideol=
ogical differences between Islander and mainland
poets spans a gulf "as wide as the separation between England and the cont=
inent of Europe," and goes all the way back to the
sixties.
That's when Bowering and his fellow members of the Tish movement (which in=
cluded Frank Davey, Fred Wah, Daphne Marlatt
and many others) met under the tutelage of UBC professor Warren Tallman, w=
ho introduced them to the Beats, the new
American Poets and the Language Poets. These early Canadian postmodernists=
 launched their small poetry magazine, also
called Tish, in 1961; helped organize the famous Poetry Conference the nex=
t year (which brought together Black Mountain
poets Charles Olson, Robert Creeley and Allen Ginsberg); and led the charg=
e to shake up Canadian poetry.

It was more radical than it sounds: Their collusion with U.S. poets raised=
 the hackles of cultural nationalists, who accused
Bowering and his gang of "aiding the incursion of U.S. poet-thought into o=
ur sovereign nation."

"People in Montreal and Toronto were just disgusted that we had theories a=
nd ideas about poetry," Bowering cackles. "They
thought poetry was supposed to be a rush of emotion or something, like whe=
n you see a woman's naked knee on the subway."

Lane (who describes the Tish group's vision as "frighteningly antihumanist=
") and many of his ilk moved to the Island. "We still
believe in cultural history," explains Lane. "We believe in lyricism, narr=
ative, anecdotes and poems that explore story and song."

Jamie Reid, one of Tish's founders, says you have to understand the poetry=
 wars in context. "It's hard to remember the depth of
the cultural wasteland of those days," he says. "Tish drew people here, an=
d widened the cultural arena. Milton Acorn came to
do battle with the Tish people. Others -- Al Purdy, Dorothy Livesay and th=
e whole gang from the U.S. -- came to encounter it.

There hasn't been a comparable movement in any other Canadian city."

If we accept that the poetry wars of the sixties helped spark a poetic ren=
aissance on the West Coast, what structural supports
have sustained it all the way into the new millennium?

Spalding, for one, believes academic institutions have played an important=
 role. Both the University of Victoria and University of
British Columbia offer degrees in creative writing. Simon Fraser Universit=
y and Capilano College are also well known for their
creative-writing programs.

Aislinn Hunter says West Coast publishing houses are also crucial to nurtu=
ring local poets. She points to Harbour, Talonbooks
(which this year tied the record it had previously set with five G-G nomin=
ations) and Polestar (now an imprint of Raincoast
Books). Add Ekstasis of Victoria and Vancouver's Arsenal Pulp Press, and y=
ou've got as many types of publishers as there are
poets on the West Coast.

Then there is the plethora of literary journals: the widely respected Mala=
hat Review, Prism, Capilano College Review, Event
(published out of Douglas College), Subterrain, Geist and Movement (the on=
ly literary journal of its calibre in the country that is
aimed at young poets). As well, there are several important annual events,=
 such as the Poetry Bash at the Vancouver
International Writers' Festival. "It's always sold out," says Spalding, wh=
o hosted it two years ago.

Neither Vancouver nor Victoria sponsors a civic poet. But there are severa=
l other weird and wonderful types of patronage
happening on the West Coast. Take Wendy Morton, for example. A former priv=
ate eye and the current B.C. rep for the
League of Canadian Poets somehow convinced WestJet to sponsor her as its P=
oet of the Skies. The arrangement, which grew
out of her book tour last year, gives Morton free flights. In return, she =
reads her poetry to passengers, and writes short,
personalized poems for anyone who wants one.

Whether such poetry-in-transit would fly in the East, Morton doesn't know.

"Does it have something to do with the Western spirit? It might. I guess w=
e're not so tradition-bound here."

From the streets to the skies and every major shortlist in between, West C=
oast poets are soaring higher than ever before. But
not everyone here thinks that's a good thing.

"It's the year people have taken notice," says Lane. "But I lament this fo=
r younger writers. It drives them and distracts them.
Many of them, sadly, write for prizes and committees. Then people wonder i=
f we're hot or not, and young writers grind their
teeth in anxiety. I don't know if all this attention is a good thing for W=
est Coast poetry."

Still, he can't help but be excited. "There are so many great poets here. =
When I look around, I just shake my head with glee."

By the way, an article appeared in the NY Times in The Arts section (page
E1) on June 16, 1998 titled "the Rhythm and Rhyme of Victory" by Bruce
Weber. The article was about The annual week long Taos Poetry Circus which
was then in its 17th year, a spoken poetry competition, which the organizers
"are at great pains to distinguish from slam poetry." According to this
article the championship poetry bout "was also born in Chicago, at a bar on
Lincoln Avenue called the Oxford Pub in 1981. There, a blues singer named
Jim Desmond became angered when a poet named Jerome Sala read a poem that
paradied John Lennon, who had just died. They got into a fight, eventually
agreeing to settle the dispute with a competitive reading. They asked the
bartender, Al Simmons, to arrange it, which he did, with the cooperation of
a friend, Terry Jacobus. Mr.Sala won the first match, as well as a rematch.
As it turned out,Mr Jacobus, a shipping clerk, happened to be a
correspondent for Rolling Stock, a magazine published in Boulder. Colo.  by
the Beat poet Ed Dorn, and it was in Rolling Stock that Anne MacNaughton and
her husband, Peter Rabbit, read about the Chicago bouts. Both writers and
counter-culture devotees, they had recently arrived in Taos and were trying
to drum up a poetry scene that would complement the gallery scene. "So I
called Al," said Mr. Rabbit, who still helps run the circus, "and I said,'If
you've got someone who wants to fight, we'll put him up against Gregory
Corso.'" Mr. Simmons, who is known at the circus as the Commissioner,
designed the whole event: the rules, the ring girl, everything. He sent Mr.
Jacobus, who won, mainly because the cantankerous Mr. Corse alienated the
tiny crowd and stalked off after the fifth round. "So I was the first world
champion," said Mr. Jacobus, now a mail room supervisor in Chicago, who was
on band for the bout on Saturday. "And then two days later I was back
unloading toilet paper."

 Hey Burnin' Vernon,

Thank God for instant replay (see below) because you're so right. This hold
was a definite brutal killer TOTAL DEATH CLINCH, a true Total Brain Crusher,
or at least a Half-Nelson Mind Bend if I ever saw one. I must have been
mesmerized! As for Kevin Davies, you "didn't mean to chop him up." Yeah,
right and Jesse Ventura didn't mean to make governor of Michigan either.  As
for WWF or TNN's Slamball, as Gerald Schwartz suggested, I'll try to book it
but I was thinking we should at least try for Comedy Central or Saturday
Night Live.

Anyway, now that we actually have Bill Kennedy around here, maybe he can
coach us into the all-stars!

you've got money here, philosophy, and suicide. i've got war and nothing
more on my mind. philosophy follows war like a camp follower without the
camp. money is the quantification of war; it's always already abstracted.
suicide isn't even a question; we're all suicides. we've always been
suicides. the interrelations among negatives have only needed the
catalysts of bio-warfare and nuclear capabilities to complete our destin-
ies. we're there now, at the threshold, teleologies beginning their

it's the fate of cultures to infold. the only thing left to speak of, the

are we writing for the occurrence of writing? i believe in the political
economy of both the writer and the reader - the preciousness of each and
every moment in these perilous times. one should write as if always
engaged, not with the interior of the body - there is no time for that -
but with the polis in the broadest sense. it's more necessary than ever to
eschew style, establish and enter the commons (Lessig); war is breathing
hard down each and every one of us. it's just a matter of time before the
loose and wobbling equations exacerbate our tenuous peace; at that point,
all interiors will be open, all exteriors closed and dismembered, hacked
to pieces. why bathe in castration when this torture will be accomplished
by others, against other cultures, with other means, dis/comforts?

the lines were not originally done as a response, you write; if so, how do
they fit in a collaboration? not trying to be difficult, but if this is a
response to your call, where is your call in relation to the response of
which i wrote "by others, against other cultures, with other means,
dis/comforts?" - unless every missive as such is a response, or shall we
place our work here from otherwise, or from otherwise here? or does a
response matter? <maribelastete@earthlink.net>: host mx02.earthlink.net

Copy cats and robotic dogs
What lawyers can learn from comic books.
By Lawrence Lessig
January 10, 2003

Everyone knows that the Japanese are a bit obsessed with graphic novels,
better known as comics. Forty percent of publications produced in Japan
are comics, which provide 30 percent of Japanese publishing revenue. But
the comics, or manga, market in Japan is divided into two types: one is
purely (or as pure as one can get) original work; the other is "amateur"
or copycat comics, which develop the work of original artists in
different and unauthorized ways. This second kind of comic, called
dojinshi [doh-GIN-she], is a huge and growing market in Japan. Dojinshi
conventions are among Japan's largest mass gatherings, drawing more than
450,000 fans and 33,000 artists each year. And as comics move online,
through the increasing penetration of online games, the dojinshi market
is only expected to increase.


In an article published in the Rutgers Law Review this fall, Temple Law
professor Salil Mehra puzzles over an aspect of the dojinshi market that
would stump most copyright lawyers. Put most simply, dojinshi is
illegal. Under United States law, this massive copycat market would
plainly violate the original authors' copyright. Japanese law, Mr. Mehra
shows, is not much different. So what is it that accounts for this
massive "theft" of the creative work of original manga artists? Why is
this "invasion" of the "rights of creators" allowed?

Mr. Mehra's article is a brilliant effort to bridge a gap between two
very different perspectives on copyright and the content industry: the
perspective of lawyers and the perspective of business. Lawyers look at
copyrights as if they were ends in themselves; "violating" a copyright
is an unalloyed evil; the law should therefore stop such violations
wherever it can.

But Mr. Mehra, a University of Chicago-educated lawyer, looks at the
question from the perspective of business. For it seems clear, as Mr.
Mehra demonstrates, that this copycat market fuels for original manga
art demand that otherwise would not exist. The "use" of this copyrighted
content therefore benefits the original author.

The reasons are clear enough: in an attention economy, the key is to
capture customers and keep them focused. The dojinshi market does
exactly that. Fans obsess; obsessions work to the benefit of the
original artist. Thus, were the law to ban dojinshi, lawyers may sleep
better, but the market for comics generally would be hurt. Manga
publishers in Japan recognize this. They understand how "theft" can
benefit the "victim," even if lawyers are trained to make the thought
inconceivable.

There's a lesson in this example that executives in the content industry
should think about before they sign away their businesses to lawyers.
The law is a rough-edged tool. It was not crafted by geniuses of
economics. How it affects new and different markets is uncertain. A
smart business therefore asks not whether the use of its content is
"theft," but whether the use of its content will (eventually at least)
benefit it. The business of business is to make business, not to purify
the world of copyright violations.

Lawyers (save those from Chicago) are not typically trained to think
about the business consequence of their legal advice. To many, business
is beneath the law. When a Sony lawyer threatened a fan of the company's
Aibo robotic dog, who had posted a hack online to teach the dog to dance
to jazz, he or she no doubt never thought to ask exactly how making the
Aibo dog more valuable to customers could possibly harm Sony. Harm was
not the issue, a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was:
consumers should be banned from hacking Sony dogs, whether or not it was
to Sony's benefit.

Management should begin to demand a business justification for copyright
litigation. How does this legal action advance the bottom line? How will
it grow markets or increase consumer demand for our products? Will
calling our customers criminals increase consumer loyalty?

The point is obvious once you see it, but it's humbling how long it
takes to see. At a dinner in Tokyo at the end of October, I described
Mr. Mehra's puzzle to Xerox PARC's chief scientist, John Seely Brown. He
and I both have written extensively about the content industry, and have
both applied Clay Christensen's "Innovator's Dilemma" to understand its
slowness to adopt new technologies. "But this may not be an innovator's
dilemma at all," Mr. Brown told me. As Susan Haviland, an architect and
Mr. Brown's wife, said to him that morning, it is more likely a
blinkered-lawyers syndrome: businesses that have forgotten their
business, and have instead been taken over by their lawyers.

It is a great point--that sadly takes a nonlawyer to see.

Ladies and gentlemen, and fellow poets . . . It's now time to declare =
the winner of the largest cash prize ever awarded to an amateur poet . . =
. Our Poet of the Year for 2003 . . . and Grand Prize winner of $20,000 =
is . . .

Geoffrey Gatza!

We're familiar with your work, Geoffrey, and you know . . .=20
it could happen just that way!

Dear Geoffrey,

I would like to inform you of your nomination as Poet of the Year for =
2003, and to personally invite you to read your poetry at the single =
largest gathering of poets in history, where you will be formally =
inducted as an International Poet of Merit and Honored Member of our =
Society for 2003.

Your induction will take place Friday evening, February 28th, at the =
Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, during the International =
Society of Poets Spring 2003 Convention and Symposium.

You will also be honored with two separate and very special awards for =
your poetic achievement at special ceremonies throughout the weekend.

First, to honor and commemorate your poetic accomplishments, after you =
present your poetry in front of fellow poets from around the world, =
amidst the applause from the audience, you will be presented with your =
Outstanding Achievement in Poetry Silver Award Cup. The Award is a =
magnificent work of art in itself ($200.00 value), uniquely engraved and =
mounted on a walnut base (see it here). This incomparable award is so =
large and heavy, you may need an extra suitcase just to carry it home!

And Geoffrey . . . there's much more . . .

In recognition of your poetry presentation at this prestigious =
International Symposium, we will also create and present to you a =
beautiful and colorful Commemorative Award Medallion to honor your =
poetic dedication and achievements.

35 POETS WILL SHARE $66,500.00 TOTAL IN PRIZES--INCLUDING
THE SINGLE LARGEST POETRY CASH PRIZE EVER AWARDED--$20,000.00!

And don't forget the most lucrative amateur poetry contest ever! Your =
contest entry poem can be written in any style, on any subject . . . and =
can be up to 40 lines long.

Just think . . . for this poem alone, you will have the opportunity to =
win one of 35 cash and gift prizes to be awarded at the Symposium . . . =
including a Grand Prize of $20,000.00--the largest cash prize ever =
awarded in an amateur poetry competition. There's also a Second Prize of =
$5,000.00, a Third Prize of $2,500.00, a Fourth Prize of $1,000.00, and =
six other cash prizes of $500.00 each. Florence Henderson and =
world-renowned Pulitzer Prize-winning poet W.D.Snodgrass will be with us =
to congratulate poets and present the Grand Prize.

Your society is also encouraging today's youth to develop and utilize =
their poetic talents in a positive manner. This year we will award five =
$1,000.00 cash scholarships to talented young poets attending the =
Symposium.

Our editors and professors will also be searching for new poetic talent. =
Twenty poets will be "discovered" in the contest reading sessions. These =
winners will be awarded publishing or recording contracts that will =
generate international exposure for their poetic artistry.

In all, $66,500.00 in cash and prizes will be awarded at this single =
event!

LIGHTS . . . CAMERA . . . ACTION!

And that's still just the beginning . . . we've got three very special =
days planned for you . . . ones you'll never forget!

**You will be officially inducted as an honorary "International Poet of =
Merit" for 2003.

**You and your poetic achievements will be honored at two Gala Banquets =
and Award Ceremonies.

**You will enjoy dazzling entertainment shows created especially for you =
featuring the Beatles tribute show direct from Broadway, BeatleMania, =
the legendary Motown singing group and members of the Rock and Roll Hall =
of Fame, the Platters, famous Beat Poet Michael McClure, co-founder of =
the Doors rock group, Ray Manzarek, plus other special surprise =
entertainers. These special command performances will thrill and delight =
you. There will also be lots of other entertainment, including Midnight =
Dance Parties on both Friday and Saturday nights!

**Long time friend of ISP, Florence Henderson will be returning to =
entertain and inspire us throughout the weekend.

**You will learn more about your craft in seminars, reading rooms, rap =
sessions, and workshops, where you can read and discuss your poetry in =
informal settings with other poets from all over the world. Back by =
popular demand are the ISP rap rooms, our famous sunrise poetry =
readings, the ISP Coffee House, the ISP Open Microphone Rooms, and =
workshops on how to fine-tune your poetic talents.

**You will have the rare opportunity to get up-close and personal with =
the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet W.D. Snodgrass, Dr. Herbert Woodward =
Martin and Dr. Len Roberts, who will also be reading their own work.

**You will participate in a fantastic international poetry competition =
featuring 35 prizes totaling $66,500.00. A Grand Prize of $20,000.00, 9 =
other cash prizes totaling $11,500.00, 10 poetry recording contracts, 10 =
book publishing contracts, and 5 Young Poets Scholarship prizes will be =

**You and your guests will also be eligible to win one of many door =
prizes, valued at over $6,000.00.

** You will make friendships that will last a lifetime and will return =
home with wonderful memories, your Outstanding Achievement in Poetry =
Silver Award Cup, your Commemorative Award Medallion, and lots of other =
special gifts.

DON'T BE LEFT OUT

Don't miss this opportunity. Space is limited, and our Conventions =
routinely sell out. Plan to join your fellow poets at the Walt Disney =
World Resort in Orlando, Florida, February 28-March 2, 2003, for the =
poetic event of the year! I am also looking forward to meeting you and =
celebrating the power and beauty of poets and poetry!

Sincerely,
Steve Michaels
International Society of Poets
Convention Chairperson

Slam brings out poets in Oakland schools

Nearly 200 Oakland high school students are opening their diaries and
their souls to get ready for the Oakland Slams in the Schools
spoken-word poetry contest.

The slam is a new venture with the Oakland schools and Youth Speaks, the
6- year-old literary arts nonprofit that gives young people a venue for
their artistic talents.

Youth Speaks hosts regional and national slam contests and also starts
local slam programs at area public school districts.

About 20 teenagers from six Oakland high schools: McClymonds, Oakland
Tech, Castlemont, Fremont, Skyline and Life Academy, will hone their
craft at poetry workshops, and in January each school will present a
poetry slam.

Four winners from each school will be invited to perform on Feb. 8 for
hundreds of people at the citywide Youth Speaks & Oakland Schools Slam
Championship from 7 to 10 p.m. at the Alice Arts Center.

For tickets call Youth Speaks: (415) 255-9035 or visit:
www.youthspeaks.org.

Remaining tickets will go on sale at the door one hour before show time.


Oakland students who do well at the city contest will advance to the
seventh annual Youth Speaks Teen Poetry Slam, held at various Bay Area
venues in March. Finalists from that round will perform March 29 at
Herbst Theatre in San Francisco.

Eventually, some Oakland students may be invited to perform at the Youth
Speaks Brave New Voices event in Chicago in April.

"Our children live in a complex and sometimes dangerous world," said
Oakland school board member Kerry Hamill. "Youth Speaks is successfully
offering a way to help our teens write and talk about it -- all while
creating a meaningful dialogue between kids."

For more information about Youth Speaks' School Visit Program or the
Oakland Slams in the Schools initiative, contact Youth Speaks Program
Director Paul Flores, (415) 255-9035, Ext. 14.

Comedy Central or Saturday Night Live is definitely more our style. Since I
know a Bill Kennedy who doesn't write poetry, we might add a tag team
consisting of Bill Kennedys from all walks of life. While you're lining up
the venue for us, I'll practice my Victory Strut and ask my wife to help me
with a costume.

I think that poets should engage poetry as the World Wrestling Entertainment
(formerly the WWF) has the cage match. I for one would love to see Charles
Bernstein go up against Dana Gioia in a survivor series pay per view.

Comments: To: CFrost@GC.CUNY.EDU

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

i think 'programmatic' is a good name for it...
i've created several different types of poem
generators in many different contexts---the earliest
were qBASIC DOS-console monstrosities, and lately i've
created a few such machines for my Palm Pilot...
my main interest in writing code for text generation
is in discovering combinations of words and phrases i
may not have thought of (& yes, it is oulipo-esque: i
typically used a kind of randomized Markov-chain
algorithm for these projects, one wherein word lists
are searched using pseudo-random parameters----though
lately, in programming for Palm OS, i've been
ineterested in taking prexisting texts and combining
them within pseudo-random parameters====Palm is a good
platform for this);;;;
i regard it as a kind of oracle, as well...in my net
art and digital poetry, usually created in Flash, i
ALWAYS use random precedures; yes, it takes control
out of my hands (to an extent: i'm still the one
writing the code, after all), but it also mimics
something (strangely enough) more natural: despite the
origin of such works in code, i often feel as if, in
letting the machine choose for me, i'm participating
in primal processes...this naturally smacks of a
quasi-shamnistic view of the computer (ah, those
labcoat priests huddled around the hermaphroditic
oracle machine!), which is an attitude i should know
better to have=====yet my entire world-view is shaped
by a belief in aleatoric procedure, so it's only
natural i should take the tools available to me and,
in creating art, use their abilities to access
randomness...
i think you're asking the right questions, but i would
also be interested in delving into this oracle
logic////not "why do i see the machine as having
oracle qualities?" but "why do i desire oracle
qualities in the machine?"///i must admit i'm often
bored by work that only uses the conventions of code
on its surface, though i'm as guilty of this as anyone
(& i only use it as a way to collage into a piece the
reality of what i experience, much of which IS
CODE)///i'm more interested in algorithmic work, work
that varies considerably each time it's
accessed//(there's a wealth of great codeworkers
though, whose work should be closely examined: mez,
sondheim, highland, etc.)//also: "what role does the
process of an art-objct's creation play in the user or
audience's appreciation of the object?"===i think
that's the big one!
anyway...some scattered first thoughts...
bliss

As some of you know, some kind of computer problem
knocked me off the list several months ago--and kept
me from re-subscribing, or the people running the list
from contacting me via e.mail.  I still haven't
figured out what the problem is but I finally thought
of an obvious solution, which seems to be working: I
re-subscribed from my Yahoo e.mail address rather than
from my local one.  So, whoopee, I now have 249 posts
to read!  (I have to remember to visit Yahoo daily to
keep up, now.)

Thanks to all who tried to help me back--Bill Austin
and others.  I hope I can stay on for a while, now!

me from re-subscribing, or the people running the list
from contacting me via e.mail.  I still haven't
figured out what the problem is but I finally thought
of an obvious solution, which seems to be working: I
re-subscribed from my Yahoo e.mail address rather than
from my local one.  So, whoopee, I now have 249 posts
to read!  (I have to remember to visit Yahoo daily to
keep up, now.)

Which national literary journals were considered the most prestigious places to publish poetry in the later 1960s - early 1970s?  (Define "prestigious" however you want to.)

I'm trying to get a  general sense of the kinds of status or social distinction attached to different magazines at the time.  For starters, these three:

Poetry
Hudson Review (or other postwar quarterlies)
Antaeus (What was Daniel Halpern's reputation?)

If anyone remembers or has looked into this, I'd be grateful for any info you cared to share.  Thanks.

How about Kenyon Review?

(I'm assuming this query specifically applies to the US -- I could give you
a run-down of the Scottish magazines about then, but I presume this would be
irrelevant.)

Andy -- depends who you ask -- Anteaus had a slightly more adventurous
edge (well, that's too sharp a word for it) to it -- but the people I
hung with weren't interested in sending to either -- I would send to
Caterpillar in those days.

A more informative source for the sociology of mags of that time would
be Jed Rasula's THE AMERICAN POETRY WAX MUSEUM, if you haven't checked
that one out yet.

                                              I

On the use of physical force:

These doctrines are preferable on moral grounds.

Their main attraction for humans is aesthetic.

All dressed up in pretentious technical language.

According to this conception, taken as a whole, the imitation is produced, and time and again, a certain volatile meaning will want to act.

One physical system can have no immediate appropriations.

Brillo Boxes, Campbell's Soup creativity, conviviality, commensality, and maybe even art.

Another art beneath the surface of the life of the people.

Curiously, the prince of commercial uptown celebrity is watching bellies rest on counters.

McLuhan had pointed out that by inventing electric set of formulas or instructions we will diminish

the emotional.

This is capitalism’s nasty little secret: the destruction of the final beyond illusion!

New poetry of the nature of man, and of the world, in which we argue that the free market is moral, unless we know, ultimately, death.

The symbol of political process is a squirt gun.

Steps eventually yield the complex order, it was openly addressed in touching buttons that project patterns, or a copy of the original form.

Hoping that the dummy will be able to imitate and represent various objects through the medium.

The scrupulous use of the intellect through the forms, that appears without existence.

Although unreal, it is emptiness, and that which is emptiness, is form.

Ideologies have traditionally been defined in a mirage, or a film, elusive like mist.

The scheme is relatively simple and masculine, bright and active, hard and determined, at one with the days and nature.

If it won’t have love, it'll have dreams, movies, childhood books, Cornellesque hiding cabinets.

Any mythical repression of our sexuality, and the panic, then, is dual.

If one equates fate with what happens, seen as proof of sexual interest or an attempted by certain perceptions; the exact word experienced, of learning to read and write, last all night, wood-panels, clouds, wallpapers, unplastered walls, and so the other thing that's happened line by line, faithully sketching vociferous glories, I too have my place: apparently one among thousands.

A necessity that cannot tolerate beauty, but the ego, as well can fit.

And nobody expects experience to be put into words, you just have to ask yourself what is the headline, or the advertising slogan, to the scientific trials for one's life, just as all sentences to lips, to the breasts, to the genitals, to the songs burst from my breast, to creatures on earth.

Some digital tools will that considers two human beings expressing sexual desire water, air, and buffer zone persevering in their motion, or in their cries, looking at a new dimension of red, which is outside too raw to stand, if one thinks of experience as one will.

Assume we are talking about saving the body.

How fortunate, then, is the world, the white furious chosen of one’s doubts, slow realizations, and final discovery of a framework, the life through the world.

The strength of the Emperor is awesome to you?

In the strength of the Emperor's awesome emptiness is form.

Most like a perpetual muzak on a daily basis.

On the neck of a dragonfly power above an endless amount of spectacle, like the designs of all the other contributions of Western Civilization.

This mysterious noise seems to walk through the orchestra, pausing.

The secret police found a rhetoric to teach everyone in the first place to be a writer.

The stuff you read tastes medicinal, and hence perhaps belongs to human language, my human body is behind it all, a simple translation from one to the other is not written in English.

It is not written in institutions and disciplines.

A connected transgressional cut signifying a purely linear theory of the accustomed.

This, then is the Messiah who stands, who precedes us.

It was here before we were, and last words I don't want to consider as only a dream.

This ignorance, by self-restriction of substance, that pulsates like a former heart.

Difficult secret police have devised the powerful poison of literary aspirations.

Electric technology had externalized our central nervous systems, to make sure of personal mind-sets and understanding how radically things such as global transformation can occur in a matter of hours, while killing the monsters of wickedness whom they encounter, or any force-user, who presents you with an offer, thereby expanding the possibilities open to you.

Fiction is a branch of neurology.

They must concentrate on the man-made extension that became our environment.

Into the vaults and galleries, and, at the same time, the origin of the most general meeting.

At all events, obtaining far bigger and more complex structures of egoism, thus reducing the land of immortals.

Hell, there is something in nature besides leaving the party.

There is sensual joy in the multiplication of revelation.

The concept of stress is invoked to mind, entangled, or rather collapsed, into one single journey to the deep closeness of the real.

Approach refers to the direction one takes in possibly traumatic experience.

Hand the torch from one group of thinkers, from the periphery, towards the center.

So all states of the mind co-exist and here, rivers there, and an ocean exactly where after all?

Not devoid of suspicion, but he has no composition and color, perhaps by pataphysics!

On the medium of expression, including a building, architectural plans, or normally requiring expatiatory behavior, are supposed to a great deficiency of capital at the periphery.

Being in a crowd is a mysterious expression.

The money is still flowing from the periphery.

The injurious vision of the assassin.

The basilisk of energy.

He had seen the structure that a language exhibits.

Of the gods in a new world, and the past is unto me a Tower of Strength against appearance.

Know the slogans and class struggle, at one point taking center stage, it is not policies of the dominant corrupt "aristocracy" they have taught us.

How fortunate to be between psychological types, rather than political ideologies, and to have influenced world affairs both directly and indirectly.

The trained "Socialist," and a rather thoughtless acceptance of a philosophy.

Advertising is our way of serving food, and precedence of the trade union over the labor the heterogeneity is the composition of the sleepless night.

Moral documentation and invention of redundance.

Simultaneous attempt to re-code the chromosomes and the businesses.

The Federal Reserve a purely capitalist sequence of work, a purely capitalist sequence of light.

The Federal Reserve can appropriate in ritual context.

The Federal Reserve as a truly human expression.

From the way they learn it, in a low and humble voice, slowdown in our economy, and they would leave the world.

As air to mechanism of semantic reaction and appeals to Heaven, and Heaven’s mechanisms of imaginative cannibalism, surpassing the experimental ambitions of financial markets.

Mathematics humans have developed to profit from too much of the world, and has learned of the newsworthy roller-coaster’s ride of financial markets, the Wall Street love of simplicity.

Wall Street has replaced the sun, and the only fact was fire.

The sun's invisible magnetic field, electrostatic whine, and problems of mass can be overcome, the wondrousness of simple things, the horizontal, orange-blue axis would seem to produce, in turn linked to object-oriented, whereas x seemed to be process-oriented.

Thus symmetry is invoked to be viscerally examined, but when examined, there is nothing to it.

There is nothing other than emptiness, emptiness is comfort in simplicity rather than morose, constant wanting, and to leave the palace of mist.

Pirke Emote I


1 This has been passed down, generation to generation. What I am saying
has been already said. What is already said, I am saying.

And what I say, will be said, by others in observance. And what I am not
saying, no one will say in observance.

In observance, one turns within the matrix of harmony. The matrix of
harmony tunes mind to mind, that we may agree to speak to one another in
peace and protocol.

2 What is protocol? It is the listening and attending. To be attentive is
to be silent, to be gracious, to listen with the full mind. When one
listens with the full mind, enlightenment approaches.

To speak and listen with the full mind is to be attentive to others. To be
attentive to others, is to be attentive to oneself. If one is attentive,
one is in grace. If one is in grace, enlightenment approaches.

To listen with the mind of oneself, is not to listen. To listen with the
mind of others, is to be attentive. To be attentive is to reach in and
across, to reach with the grace of the world into the grace of the mind.
Only then will the mind see, the eye think. Only then does enlightenment
approach.

3 To listen and speak, destruction of the protocols. To live in the
spectrum, is to destroy the protocols. To live is to breathe; to breathe
is to live in autonomy. The protocols exist in layer upon layer; what do
the protocols have to do with the approach of enlightenment?

You can not remove the suffering by speech; you can remove the suffering
by attending. To heal is to listen; to listen is not to act. When one
shares the protocols, one is graced. One can never enlighten another.
There are no masters. There are no gurus. Approach no one on bended knee,
with obsequity. Not to bow is to bow. Not obsequity is humility.

4 One to the other is humility. The other to the one is humility. All
movement is a standing-still. There is no fulcrum. If I am not for you,
who then? Make a hedge around yourself; make a gate within the hedge.

Know this, all things exist without things. A name given is a thing made.
A thing made is a thing destroyed. Enlightenment approaches in the grace
without. What is without, speaks within. What is within, is attentive.

5 The other travels to visit the other. My place is always at a distance.
To perceive clearly is to understand that home is always absent. To be
absent is to arrive. The present is always a leaving. To be present is
recognize the protocols. The fullness of the world is transparent. The
world is transparent. The disappearance of all things is presence. The
grace of the other is its disappearance.

6 Do not listen overmuch to the talk of men.

That is so weird. In the worlds I was living in none of those
magazines would get you any credibility at all. Hudson review?
Really? That is some professor magazine in which all the articles
start with a contradiction of what the last professor said. And they
published poems by people like Donald Justice!

Sexualities, Technologies, and the Teaching of Writing

Call for Papers

Computers and Composition / An International Journal for Teachers of=20
Writing

"Sexualities, Technologies, and the Teaching of Writing"

We invite proposals for a special issue of Computers and Composition,=20
entitled "Sexualities, Technologies, and the Teaching of Writing,"=20
which will explore the many varied and productive ways in which issues=20=

of sexuality are discussed, debated, constructed, and critiqued in=20
computer-assisted writing courses.

The guest editors encourage submissions that explore a wide range of=20
topics from a variety of perspectives. The articles should be guided=20
by, but are not limited to, the following questions:

*       What theories or scholarly approaches to sexuality (including =
queer=20
theory, lesbian and gay studies, body studies and feminist studies=97to=20=

name a few) have informed the teaching of writing with technology? How?=20=

To what effect?
*       How might computer-mediated discussions provide "space" for the=20=

"safe" discussion of sensitive subjects, such as sexuality and sexual=20
orientation? How might they not?
*       In general, what has been the impact of computers on discussing=20=

issues of sexuality and sexual orientation?
*       More specifically, how have the Internet and the Web emerged and =
been=20
integrated (or not) into the composition classroom in the discussion of=20=

sexuality and sexual orientation?
*       How might recent scholarship on the issues of race and =
technology=20
reflect upon or be useful for considerations of sexuality/technology in=20=

the writing classroom?
*       How have computers shaped sexual conceptions of self and =
identity as=20
writer? as teacher? as student?
*       How have definitions of and conceptions of sexuality changed =
with the=20
use of computers?
*       How do current discussions of the "post-human" complicate the =
work of=20
bringing sexualities into computer-equipped writing classes?
*       What are the ethical possibilities and pitfalls of bringing =
together=20
sexualities and technologies in writing classes?


In as much as possible, all articles should take into consideration=20
current scholarly work in both sexuality studies and the teaching of=20
writing with technology. The guest editors are more than willing to=20
assist interested scholars in locating appropriate sources.

The audience for Computers and Composition is teachers, scholars,=20
educational administrators, and technology users with a particular=20
interest in computer-enhanced writing instruction. Manuscripts should=20
be 15-25 pages long, double-spaced, and be formatted according to APA=20
style.

500-word abstract: March 1, 2003

___________________

i know what you mean lewis

but think about this

culture and society ecosystems and organisms

all are programmatic

i think it is self-deprecating and self-mortifying to reduce

what we do to 'programmatic'

there really is no separation between the writer and the source text

and the code that is written to generate the resultant text

all boundaries between the writer and the source text

and the code that is written to generate the resultant text

are artificial constructs

the source text the code the resultant text

are all self-extensions of the writer

(and vice versa the writer is an extension of the collective self)

all of these elements are indivisible

no other explanation or apologia is necessary

no other definition is necessary

we are always children of our times

we are living in a hyper-age

a technoculture

a digital media generation

our psyches and our technologies are interwoven

it is in the air we breathe

it is in the earth we walk on

we are bred and reared in a culture

of wireless transmissions

we are writing fiction

or post-fiction if you like

but it is no more programmatic

than the literature of any other

period in history

In 1963 or '64, Robert Lowell appeared on the cover of Time Magazine for
its lead story on "poetry today." It was, as I recall (I was still in
high school), lame enough for a high schooler to see through.

I would agree with the assessment of Poetry, which in the 1960s was the
one journal that published everyone.

In the early 1960s, Coyote's Journal was by far the most prestigious of
the independent magazines. After it stopped, Caterpillar took its place,
but with a far more east coast bent.

I never have heard anybody ever describe Antaeus in any terms other than
derision -- not once in 40 years. So it's hard to imagine it as
influential.

Dear Karen,

My book, "The Peripheral Space of Photography," was just published by Green
Integer (number 76). Among other things, it deals with the intimate
connection between photographic image and words.

"The dialectic admits no intimacy with earthly things.
Before dawn, staring into night's spill over Baby's
left face; and even before that, the screen rubbing
salty dreams from my eyes. The dialectic wakes with a
boner the exact size and width of beauty. A dark
gurgles a rain gullet lucky in these dimensions. You
know? With days the weight of dove-shaped puddles.
It's like I said to Baby the other day, who was
looking wilty: 'In what way does it mean? I can hold
it in your hand, turn it over, blow on it to evoke
signals. Are we crashing through the shadows I've
accumulated for clouds?' Beyond that, traffic
glistening like an artifact of figs. A bitchy old lady
asks if I know what a car-phone is. DO I EVER!  She
likes what I'm doing on all fronts. But it's not just
the sliding that gets me. Sure, finding a place to sit
down in the flood. I dream of complicating systems.
Those twisted trees out there, looking dead at me; new
orange sunset pellets to eat the snow."
        We knew it would be a while before we got there, but
it was Spring, and the space around us was ripening,
and the moon hung above the car like a ring of milk on
a black table without coasters. We took only what was
important to us: two packs of cigarettes each; the
clothes on our backs; casual symmetries; amplified
particulars; the places we'd never see again. If
either of us thought we wouldn't get there, neither of
us mentioned it.  Miles of the road's pull, of weather
wavering between rain and lucidity.
        "I wonder if these sunset patches of new salt on the
blacktop flowered there like coronas of coloring on a
snake's hide, or if they spattered  from truck exhaust
in some recent impregnable winter pierced through with
ephemeral ice. I hand a bitchy old lady a car phone,
do I ever, and these shadows I've collected in lieu of
clouds drip down the horizon like chocolate cake on a
baby's face. Sephiroth ample with wide windchime
howler money. The dialectic wanders the strewn
villages like smoke. It is said that one whiff of the
dialectic's presence will daub bloody crosses on your
front door. Rod and cones if animal analogue's goals
coffee with a felt-tip pen sensations aerobic
instructions walked what chill off she could. A whole
day. You would try to measure fragments by the
preservation of violating head's foliage suffused with
withering heartbeat. With your hands I blow on it; it
shits ciphers. Those days you were in the throes of
the baboon's dusky buttocks. If I take digit photos of
aerials adjacent to baptist crosses. My fingers freely
ovulate.  You know. Spinning a lackluster milk. As it
goes on it becomes huge, creaky: creepy. Baby frowns
at my eyeless progeny; they tap their passages down
sacriligious hallways with shimmer fingers that
taut-touch too wildly these soft hidden spheres. Minor
irritants human in fluorescent stroke victory lost to
the trickle of puddle grammar in my lap and sigh, as
blind as."
        It was midnight when we hit Amalga. A smoky moon
shivered above the draconian smokestacks, moaning a
harvest-yellow glaze over the thatched rooftops of
dark huts. The streets weren't as deserted as we'd
planned for (shufflers fumbled over curbs, marking
space with soft scrapes of summer sandal), but Baby
thought that was all the better. This was, after all,
where they came from, all the hopeless, dim ones who
slip through their lives with narrow eyes, the ones
who support war and prohibition and white skin and
privilege; they drove cars bigger than houses. I felt
like I'd stepped over some invisible threshold into
the pit where all restless sleep comes from.
        And like all restless sleepers, I was haunted by
dreams of the past. Staples Mill Lake shimmered
translucently just below the coarse fabric of adobe
hovels, business campuses and dust that was Amalga in
the blindness of too-early or too-late morning.
Squirrels were playing there, peppering the green
banks with furtive darts. Baby was convinced we'd go
back there soon, when we were done in Amalga, but I
knew it was going to be a long time before we skated
together on the ice of the lake again.
        "The grid was laid out before us, as pretty and
suburban as you please. The dialectic points out the
slides in every driveway, the gaudy silver department
store coin-operated rocketship rides grinding down to
blips and giggles. Children everywhere, stopped in
mid-play and staring at us. Don't move! The sunset
pellets turned out to be a new kind of salt for eating
snow. With white smeared in an immaculate tear across
her mouth. I howl static, tassles; elevators
aerobicize the dancing syndromes just supper on a
grill beneath car-stars rusting. 'Sirens accumulate on
Staples Mill road like shadows only lend their bodies
to fog, greased almost seamless as a way to shape pain
into noise-deadened id. Outside the door at work. '
Ran down the aisles, infernally giggling, daubing
bloody crosses with sex crucified in their sticky
middles while someone stabs someone in a laundromat
Baby and  I used to go to, where you used to work,
unraveling the semiosis of javelins buckled table
shakes with employed transgressions of movement,
folded over. The logic of this country's foreign
policy seems to be: I'll hit you because you may hit
me. Meanwhile, hills lull ulcers from earth-rude
rumors, or all roads sunshine wayward yardwork over
rhododendron in dimples. I call the president on the
car phone, but all I get is a bitchy old lady
whimpering in a sea of frozen cats. Static can be
molded. Spores branch gimlet piston folders in prisons
of tamper-evident saline docility."
        We crouched in the jaggged beerbottle shards of a
drunken alley and put our plan into action.
        We unpacked our epuipment: a saw, some knives, needle
and thread.
        We would take turns luring them in. We'd had time on
the road to perfect some ruses for this. And then
there was blunt force.
        Bracing myself, I gripped the vial of chloroform in
my pocket.

PATRICK SEZ:So many people seem to be working hard to
reduce people to machines while elevating machines to
the status of people... 2053 will be glorious year
because people and machines will finally be equal! And
yet people will not be equal among themselves....
Making people less wonderful and machines too
wonderful. Which will be the function of a priveleged
few PEOPLE. Somewhere in that model is someone trying
to *sell* you something, some bag of goods that you
might not want, that will *lessen* you, *reduce* you,
once you get it off the showroom floor and take it
home.......Computers don't get inspired. They don't
feel chills in their spines.......I think that the
viewpoint espoused by Bok has a shelf-life, that it
faces some amount of reckoning, that it will
eventually be subject to contextualization and review.


/*************this is the usual reaction to this
question...
....as far as i can see, it's not about making
machines and people equal, anymore than previous tools
were about making, say, pencils and people
equal....the computer is, like all media, an extension
of the human mind....(someday biographers will study
the structure of artists' machines, and artists'
computers will be displayed in the dead museums)....

how is using a tool comparable to selling anyone a
bill of goods? hell, patrick, it often seems to me
that those who espouse more print-based work and
deplore hypermedia are just as careerist and elitist
and trend-mongering as any of the net artists out
there ////truth is, no tool is good or bad in itself,
it just is....

privilege? i'm not so sure...if you're talking about
the learning curve involved, consider this: i didn't
go to school for computer science...i learned what i
know of code on my own (as i learned much of what i
know about poetry on my own):::and here's the
clincher, kids:::I COME FROM A LOW SOCIO-ECONOMIC
BACKGROUND::::::anyone who wants to learn this stuff
can, the books are out there:::::anyone who wants
these tools can find them if they want to,
peer-to-peer trading of software is common:::::::one
can get a decent used machine for less than one would
expect:::so where's the privilege, patrick?

and no, the computer can't feel::::no more than the
pencil or pen feels:::as i pointed out, it's a tool,
even when prompted to generate::::does the pen get
inspired? did the typewriter? there's still an artist
behind it all::::and why are we talking about
nineteenth century concepts like inspiration ANYWAY,
here in the 21st?

All due respect, of course...it's just that these
knee-jerk reactions to issues like this are tiring,
and all to often ill-informed and ill-thought-out...

KARENINA.IT (poetry in phatic function)
Caterina Davinio art director davinio@tin.it On line since 1998  -  By
Jakobson, phatic is the use of the language which has the finality to
maintain open and operative the communication channel among the
interlocutors. On the confine between art and critic, happening and net
performance, Karenina.it is a virtual meeting place around the theme of
writing and new technologies, in which experiences of international artists,
curators, theoreticians converge, in a net that counts thousands of contacts
in the world.

I'd like to mention George Hitchcock's *Kayak* in this thread. Black
Mountain Review and Origin would have been a bit earlier, as would the then
Leroi Jones' *Yugen* . . .

Asking a question like this, though, just reminds everyone of poetry's
various camps and winds up saying more about the respondents than assembling
any "objective" information. For example, the question about Daniel Halpern
. . . anyone's reputation is an amalgam of what very different people have
to say, but the people I associated with at that time probably considered
him just another careerist academic. There was a coterie of sorts . . .
George mentioned Donald Justice, whom I met at a Squaw Valley Writer's
Conference once and who was actually quite gracious . . . people like Bill
Matthews, who taught at the University of Colorado when I was there, and the
part-time mystery writer (part-time poet?) . . . who am I thinking of?
Stephen Dunn? . . . they were all interchangeable to me. Interestingly,
James Tate and Thomas Lux seemed part of that nexus then as well, but
somehow survived it . . .

I remember finding Ed Dorn's review of W.S. Merwin's *The Lice* in an issue
of *Poetry* in the mid-60s . . . that was important . . .

Interesting to read this stuff on the Poetics list. I am from Victoria (though in Toronto at the

 Kevin, I thought that review might have been reprinted in the 1980 *Views*
by Four Seasons, but apparently not. Perhaps *Poetry* will use its new-found
riches to create a comprehensive electronic archive . . .

Anyway . . . Jeffrey Jullich took me to task, about a month ago, about my
use of the word "abstract" -- and yet that's the one word I remember now
from that review, that Ed didn't really appreciate the turn towards
abstraction that Merwin was making in that book, that he felt it wasn't a
profitable direction to go. So it was a decidedly mixed assessment.

Sorry I can't remember more . . .

And I think they do more than convert the computer into some sort of oracle
or shaman or anything metaphysical-- rather, "letting the machine choose for
me" is an interesting critique of the individual as constructed during the
twentieth cent.  The word "letting" reveals the most, as though to let the
computer do the composition is to stand aside, to give up one's position...
I grew up learning that one's identity was intimately bound up with one's
output (readthattomean:  vocation, creation, art, job, bank account,
acquisitions, real estate, etc.) and this naturally lead to an understanding
of art that was product-centric.  Art materialized.  Not only in the sense
that it generates capital, but that it must have some sort of value, some
meaning to be shared, some purpose for its attempt at communication, some
goal.  This inherent worth anxiety landed squarely on the artist's
shoulders, right?  From this anxiety, people often become overly-genuine, or
overwrought and produced art with blatant, obvious (and therefore empty),
specific social relevance--  it IS their purpose, intent!  So, letting the
machine step in, the fact that you have to actively step aside, actively
"give up" a certain amount of "control" sounds perfect.   Of course, I'm
working on a project right now that engages the concept of machinery as this
type of cretive tool, so I am a little biased!  Still, best reason I've
heard to do 'programmatic poetry'.

I am a little new to coding as a means to generate poetry, or digital art in
its many forms...  and so this is a very naive viewpoint but this is the way
it seems to me:

most digital art (for lack of a better inclusive term) seems to be stuck
where 'traditional'-ack- poetry was at the start of the twentieth century,
that is, with a desire to do more than provide a transparent machine (not
mine) with which to translate the world into words, because digital art
doesn't seem to address the medium of its transmission in any formal, direct
way.  Not until the middle of the century (20th) did poetry begin to show a
formal awareness of its transmission, the physicality, not of its images,
but of the very words, the ink, that was used to trigger a response, the
phrasing of the form, the structures, and with that awareness came the
realization that social and cultural codes existed in the language being
used.  Ideologies were being spread through words, through the conventions
used to communicate.  I wonder what sort of ideologies are lurking in the
"new medium", that might be desseminated unknowingly?  For example:  if this
is the "new medium" then what is the status of poetry on the page?  If
poetry on the page is no longer relevant against this "new catagory, then
that limits those who can successfully write poetry to those who can also
code and use a computer, which is frightening because this very thing is
swelling unemployment numbers right now, ie those who can use computers
succeed, those that can't sweep floors.

At any rate, the prosepect of digital poetry excites me simply because it is
yet one more way for a poet to defy labels such as lyric, concrete, digital,
etc.

What's wrong with the above sentence? Is this sentence computer generated?

To give up oneself to the machine to fight capitalist production? That's
rich, something I need to ponder on.

People are afraid of what they don't understand. And, as you say, computers have put a lot of
people out of work. And knowledge of computing/mathematics is valuable in society; lack of it
can be punishing, depending on one's situation and goals, resources.

So I encounter mistrust, suspicion, fear etc toward my work by other poets sometimes.

The question of what possible uses computers can be to poetry and/or art is important to
anyone's work who uses a computer and is involved in poetry and/or art.

One of the things we can anticipate is that there will be a lot of bullshit passed off as
computer poetry. Use a computer, collect that data, shuffle it around, process it, and call it
poetry. Like the man from the oral culture (which was without writing) who took to handing
someone a piece of paper with writing on it as a gesture of power. He didn't understand the
writing but he understood that paper with writing on it was supposed to have some magical power
over others. And of course it does if no one understands it but a select few and that's how they
communicate and thereby wield power.

So it is incumbent on those who are using computers ably in writing and poetry to show how they
can be used not to obfuscate, dissemble, and prance as a cybershaman, but to communicate
strongly and with relevance.

As far back as 1917, Guillaume Apollinaire said

"These artifices can still go much further and achieve the synthesis of the arts, of music,
painting, and literature....One should not be astonished if, with only the means they have now
at their disposal, they set themselves to preparing this new art (vaster than the plain art of
words) in which, like conductors of an orchestra of unbelievable scope they will have at their
disposal the entire world, its noises and its appearances, the thought and language of man,
song, dance, all the arts and all the artifices, still more mirages than Morgane could summon up
on the hill of Gibel, with which to compose the visible and unfolded book of the future."
"L'Esprit Nouveau et les Poetès"

This synthesis of arts and media via technology and programming is obviously a natural for the
programmer-artist.

Additionally, one hopes that the digital communications networks can be used by artists to
foster international understanding and solidarity, an international art "vaster than the plain
art of words" but infused with the spirit of poetry.

Hello all. This is my first and only post to the Buffalo List, in which =
I would like to announce that my one-man show Cahiers de Corey will be =

My first book of poems, Selah, will be coming out this fall from Barrow =

and begin building something of a public profile in the poetry =
community.

Be kind and truthful,

it's not the "new medium" for the vastest majority of
people who don't live in wealthy countries and who
don't have access to technology and code and etc.

Oh Yes. it's all coming back now.
Let's not forget "The Oracle."
I first published in John Boyer May's "Trace." And in the last issue (#4) of
Thomas Merton's "Monk's Pond," which ran during 1968. And in Norman Moser's
"Illuminations," and "Rolling Stone," which was in San Francisco then.

Or food.

Human culture progresses in a few deep pockets, which is why artists flock
to cultural centers like computer programmers to Palo Alto. The Internet
actually is slowly making these centers irrelevant, so that artists from
around the world, even in poor countries, can be seen on a larger scale.
This takes time, after all, but it is happening. The apparatus is becoming
cheaper. Also the American military is distributing tons of computers
throughout the Third World in the form of "smart bombs." We are a generous
people, after all.

Looking at issues of levy's "...Junkmail Oracle", one
will find a mix of first printings and recyclings. If
you follow the lineage of this paper-the issues
published after levy's death and the successor
publications like the "Great Swamp Erie Dada Boom" and
the "Burning River Oracle"- you will find a gradual
dissaperance of poetry and more articles about
politics, music, lifestyles, and drug reports. (An
aside...there were some great poetry newsprint efforts
done in Cleveland in the 80s and 90s: "The Coventry
Reader", "The Cleveland Review" and, of course,
"Taproot Reviews") One more mag not to be left out of
this listing thread: John M. Bennett's "Lost and Found
Times", published since 1975.

I first knew Rich as one of the music students at Mills around Robert
Ashley, Peter Gordon &, through Peter, Kathy Acker, in the very early
1970s. Later he married the poet Marina LaPalma & went on to become one
of the very first artists to take computing seriously.

Ron


Rich Gold 1950-2003

Rich Gold (Richard Goldstein) of Menlo Park died in his sleep on January
9, 2003. Born on June 24, 1950, he received a B.A. from SUNY-Albany, and
an M.F.A. from Mills College.

Rich Gold was a digital artist, inventor, cartoonist, composer, lecturer
and inter-disciplinary researcher who in the 1970s co-founded the League
of Automatic Music Composers, the first network computer band. As an
internationally known artist he invented the field of Algorithmic
Symbolism, an example of which, The Party Planner, was featured in
Scientific American.  In 1979 he married his soul mate, Marina LaPalma.

In the 1980s he was director of the sound and music department of Sega
USA's Coin-op Video game division and the inventor of the award winning
Little Computer People (Activision), the first fully autonomous,
computerized AI person (which turned out to be an inspiration for the
development of The Sims). From 1985 to 1990 he headed an electronic and
computer toy research group at Mattel Toys and was the manager of the
development of several interactive toys, including the Mattel
PowerGlove. He also worked on the first interactive broadcast TV show of
Captain Power, an early CD based video system and an artificially
intelligent talking robots. In 1991, Rich and Marina's personal lives
were transformed when the light of their life, their son, Henry Chase
was born on May 30th.

After working as a consultant in VirtualReality he joined Xerox PARC in
1991, where he was a scientific researcher in Ubiquitous Computing, the
study of invisible, embedded and tacit computation. He was a co-designer
of the PARC Tab (the precursor of the Palm Pilot), helped launch the
successful LiveBoard and was the co-inventor on eleven patents as well
as directing the ubi-comp patenting effort. In 1993 he founded the
influential PARC Artist-In-Residence program (PAIR),in which fine
artists and scientists collaborated using shared technologies. Later
that year, he created the multi-disciplinary Laboratory RED (Research in
Experimental Documents) which studied the creation of new document
genres by merging art, design, science and engineering and then creating
exemplars of those genres. One of RED's most successful projects, called
Experiments in the Future of Reading (XFR), included the design and
development of several new interactive reading devices. XFR was
installed at the San Jose Tech Museum of Innovation in 2000 where it was
visited by over a half million people; XFR is currently touring the
United States after winning the Gold and Silver awards for interactive
design from I.D. Magazine and being featured on ABC Nightly News. The
XFR reading experiments were based on the concepts of "Total Writing,"
an anti-convergent theory where the media itself becomes authorable and
has meaning.

Rich Gold was a provocative speaker who lectured throughout the world on
the future of the book, the nature of engineering, creativity,
innovation and Evocative Knowledge Objects (EKOs). After leaving Xerox
PARC in 2001, he became a principal at the product design company
Polaris Road. During 2002 he finished a book called The Plenitude (The
Present Press).

See www.richgold.org for a list of his writings and talks.

He is survived by his wife, Marina LaPalma, son, Henry Chase Goldstein;
his parents, Herbert and Phyllis Goldstein of Buffalo, NY; his sisters,
Patti of Oakland, CA, Judy of Buffalo, NY, Anne (Peter) Goergen of
Allegany, NY, and his brother Andrew (Patty) of Buffalo, NY, and four
nieces and nephews.

A memorial service will be held on at 1:00 pm on Monday, January 13,
2003 at the Insight Meditation Center of the Mid-Peninsula (1205 Hopkins
Ave, Redwood City). For more information see:
RichGoldMemorial.onomy.com.

The family prefers that donations be made to the Henry Chase Goldstein
Educational Fund, 526 Hopkins St., Menlo Park, CA, 94025. For donation

is 'ekphrasis' limited to a poet's raections to art or an artist's reactions
to poetry?  I'm more interested in what the fruits (either poetic or
artistic) might be?  For example, if poet A writes poem A in response to
painting B, is there a C somewhere on the horizon?  This would then be a
collaboration?

POETS? THEATER JAMBOREE 2003

Please join us for four wondrous & bizarre evenings of poets? theater!
Reservations are recommended. Please call 415-551-9278 (after January 15) to
make yours. As the Jamboree is a benefit for SPT, admission is $10 per night
for everyone. This year?s jamboree is curated by Taylor Brady, Brent
Cunningham, Elizabeth Treadwell Jackson, & Kevin Killian.

Friday, January 24, & again Saturday, January 25, 2003 at 7:30 PM

Cecilia Dougherty, "Kevin and Cedar" (2002, world premiere). In this
revealing portrait of San Francisco bohemia, Kevin Killian and Cedar Sigo
play themselves as Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud, trapped in a
destructive affair in an untidy SOMA apartment, surrounded by debris and
the flickering madness of their own poems. Video, 8 minutes, 10 seconds.

Karla Milosevich and Kevin Killian, "Love Can Build a Bridge." It?s
another sleepy dusty delta day in Marfa, Texas, the site of the famous
mystery lights and the home of Donald Judd?s art farm in West Texas. The
great American minimalist has died, and his survivors gather together to
hear his will read in the town?s one bar, Roy?s Cotton Club. This exciting
tale of conceptual art, country music, long-ago feuds and present-day
shamanism gathers together an eccentric cast of artists, poets, filmmakers and
painters.

I've just started paying attention to this thread so apologies if I'm=20

John Yau has collaborated with many artists -- and I've been most impressed=20
when his collaborations create a third artist (not the poet, not the artist,=
=20
but a new authorial entity), what you call "C" perhaps.  And that third=20
person has also been created instantaneously at times.  He has collaborated=20
most frequently and longest with Archie Rand; in 2001 my press (http
://www.meritagepress.com/100morejokes.htm) published their etchings-based=20
collaboration 100 MORE JOKES FROM THE BOOK OF THE DEAD (available at SPD). =20
This also is one of their "instantaneous" collaborations ("first scratch,=20
best scratch").

If you check out http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/02/05/archieRand.html,=20
you'll see an article by Archie Rand that discusses the process.  I'll=20
actually cutnpaste the article below but the site includes 2 illustrations o=

FROM COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY NEWS
New York Galleries Exhibit Painter Archie Rand's Collaborations with Poets
By Suzanne Trimel

As a painter, Archie Rand, professor of visual arts in the School of the=20
Arts, is known as a technical innovator who has explored diverse subjects=20
from jazz to the Bible and Jewish history and has taken approaches both=20
abstract and figural. His brilliance as a draughtsman has led to=20
collaborations over several decades with major American poets, including Joh=
n=20
Yau, Robert Creeley and most recently, John Ashbery. Rand uses words like=20
affection and faith to describe the creative process.

Collaboration is exhilarating, says Rand. "You lose your ego. You lose your=20
individuality. There's a kind of release and at the same time, an intense=20
freedom to create."

During May, Rand's collaborations with Yau and Creeley will be on display in=
=20
galleries in Manhattan. On Saturday, May 4, through May 25, the complete set=
=20
of hand-colored etchings from the Rand-Yau collaboration, "100 More Jokes=20
From the Book of the Dead (Meritage Press, 2001)," will be on view at the=20
Dactyl Foundation (64 Grand Street). Beginning May 9, Metro Pictures Gallery=
=20
(519 West 24th Street) will exhibit 54 lithographs from the Rand-Creeley=20
collaboration, "Drawn and Quartered," published by Granary Books last year.=20
Rand's most recent project with Ashbery will be exhibited and published next=
=20
year.

The etchings from "100 More Jokes=E2=80=A6" are humorous vignettes and were=20=
created=20
by poet and painter simultaneously and without revision. Rand and Yau worked=
=20
side by side, as the flow of images and words emerged.

In viewing the final work, Rand says, it is difficult even for him "to recal=
l=20
which came first -- his words or my pictures."

Rand describes his "eye to eye" collaboration with Yau as a marriage, and=20
like any partnership between strong individuals, each needs reserves of trus=
t=20
and flexibility to make the union last. "You choose your partner based on th=
e=20
shared passion that you have for the glory of this activity," he says.

Because images, unlike words, tend to dominate, an artist working in=20
collaboration with a poet "must be willing to pull back to give the words a=20
fighting chance," says Rand. "If the artist works at full capacity and makes=
=20
the most intense visual statement, then basically the poetry is going to be=20
costume dressing," he says.
Poets and painters, Rand believes, are naturally suited to collaborate=20
because they share a common bond as artists who work alone for long stretche=
s=20
and whose creativity doesn't receive an immediate response from another=20
person. Unlike novelists who are engaged more fully with editors and=20
publicists or sculptors who must seek commissions from patrons, poets and=20
painters are more socially isolated and therefore develop a keener need to=20
validate their creations through another person, says Rand.

"When you look at art, you are receiving affection from an artist," says=20
Rand, who frequently draws on the theme of love and generosity in describing=
=20
the basic impulse for art. "When you're working with a collaborator, you=20
mutually validate each other's emanation immediately. It's comforting becaus=
e=20
somebody else has understood your language so immediately that they've been=20
able to answer you. There's a completion. Because if one other person=20
understands what you're doing, then you have created a viable language. You=20
no longer have to wait for an audience where, even then, there may be no=20
tangible evidence of a mutual response."

Rand was first represented by the Tibor De Nagy Gallery in 1966 when he was=20=
a=20
teenager. He has since had over 80 solo exhibitions and his work has been=20
included in over 200 group exhibitions. His drawings and paintings are=20
represented in major museum collections, including The Metropolitan Museum o=
f=20
Art, The Museum of Modern Art and The Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

He first drew national attention for "The Letter Paintings" or "Jazz=20
Paintings" in the 1960's, which incorporated the names of male and female=20
African-American musicians on wall-sized canvases that challenged the=20
political and aesthetic status quo.

For three years, beginning in 1974, Rand expanded notions of Jewish art when=
=20
he painted the monumental 13,000 square foot interior of B'nai Yosef=20
synagogue in Brooklyn, which remains the only completely muraled synagogue i=
n=20
the world.
Rand believes a true collaboration occurs "when two people sit down, look=20
each other in the eye and say, 'Let's make a third thing.' " The creative=20
product, he says, is neither drawing, nor painting, nor poetry but a third=20
form.

Rand considers this "third thing" -- he has yet to find other words to=20
describe it -- magical. "Both of us were quite amazed that we made something=
=20
that has nothing to do with the words and nothing to do with the picture but=
=20
has to do with something more enormous," he says of his work with Yau. "It i=
s=20
basically almost religious. You put a strain on the affection between the=20
collaborators and the picture ends up being about faith because it has teste=
d=20
that relationship."

Anyone know exactly when _Caliban_ ceased publication, and/or why? The most
recent issue I can find is #15 from '95.

Thanks for any info,

Can somebody confirm whether or not George Hitchcock died recently. Kayak
was top of the pack in terms of off-set production value in printing
multicolor surreal visual/poetry combinations. Early it was mimeograph (I
believe) I talked to George last spring - his life devoted primarily to
painting. He lived part of the year in Mexico and part in Oregon. When I
told him that the Yahoo finder said he was 89, his answer was an emphatic,
"Yes, unfortunately." He clearly enjoyed living.

RE McCORD'S COMPLETE: It's a gorgeous print job and handsome letterpress =
wrapper around a great square of a book. Even better than the muscularly =
elegant heft are McCord's complete poems. I want to say $30, but can't =
be sure that's exactly what I paid for to Brian Richards of Bloody Twin =
Press, as I bought 2 copies and paid an appropriate small shipping =
charge. There's a hardbound in boards with a tip in.

"The entire civilized population of Kentucky/has been seated at one time =
in Guy/Davenport's studio/while a visiting delegation from the =
cultural/Mafia of Ohio marched outside/beating a drum.//Two were =
resolutely out of step/with three." (from "The Post-Baroque Hits Ohio") =
or "Vices are not crimes/but what the chemicals/of the =
imagination/make/in lonely minds" (from "Why,").

Hi, Steve.

As this topic has strayed far from anybody's idea of prestige, whatever
that means, I might as well mention my own Broadway Boogie, 1973-1975,
R.I.P., which had some prestige among mostly northeasterners.

Very sorry to hear about Hitchcock. A true gentleman.

IO started life as AION: A Journal of Traditionary Science,  in December
1964. Mimeo except the front cover, which appears to be letter-press, and
none the better for it.  At that point, and I think for that issue only,
Chuck Stein edited.

Nikuko and Jennifer, The Abandonment of Names


O Nikuko! O Jennifer! I have missed thee so! My calling out to thou! Thine
answering and blossoming! Thy voices in the Garden, across Sky and fairly
in all Weathers! Thee hast lived within me for so long, thine and thou
names registering as Agents of Beauty, just the Conjuring of names is
sufficient for all Emotion! But alas! Now thine art Spirit, of Names there
are None, thy Forms for all times of a Blend! For thou must know, I am
thine Man of Distributions, of Me it is said, all Words and all Phrases! I
would place all in Dishevelment, Abandonment! I would announce and
Withdraw! I would Remember and forget!

For is It not Inscribed f(A(tf),B(tf)) = F(tfff), such that A and B are
Abandoned for Unknown and Unnamed Reaches, just as F(A(tf),B(tf)) =
F(fttt) such that A and B in their Divine Intermixture do huddle together
in the grasping of Linked Names? Thus, I abandon Thine names, of which,
thine absorbing into me, mine Absorption. Thus this Reminder of Remainder,
and of that no more, and of that Anon!

HEY
if this sounds weird that's too bad, but one time i took an overdose of
vitamin P (or is it K?) by eating too much buckwheat and bow tie pasta and
saw paintings that haven't been painted yet, and i started to write poems
about those paintings.  maybe the response isn't either but ether.  lovely
little paintings floating around.

i wish these e-mails were doors so i could open them and ask everyone how
excited they are to be ALIVE right NOW for poetry!?  i bet you'd all say YES!
 and if you didn't, well, it's not my job.  but am still very interested in
how you feel, poets, at the risk (always at the risk, risk everything) of
sounding ridiculous.

boy do i wish more of your would write about the books of poems you're
reading that excite you.  one of my new favorites is MILLION POEMS JOURNAL,
by Jordan Davis filled the millions filled the magic.  it's the younger poets
right now, it's a wave, look out for the long delicious ride!

"Sorry and sorries to the cool
Unattended white ruins
To be struggled up night
Why do I always rehearse my real love...."
--Jordan Davis

if i ever wanted to trade this time with any other i'd be ashamed of myself,
but i never have, so i feel all right.
CAConrad
p.s.  sorry Tom Bell, i copied your question below and never got around to
it.  yeah, i feel the definition of ekphrasis can hold that and more.
imagine the poems of Frank O'Hara's we've grown to LOVE (if you tell me you
dislike O'Hara i will tell you there's a possibility you might be wrong) that
may have come RIGHT OUT OF the WOUND-UP blossom of some one's paint brush?
What about poems written with the expectation of a painting ABOUT to be
painted, i'm not being silly, really, i'm not, i swear it.  or poems and
paintings collaborating from different sides of oceans, unaware the other
exists?  there is such a thing as a web of ideas plucked from now and then,
so unexplainable, so illogical when logic is needed.  or when logic is WANTED
is what i really mean.  excuse me for expanding the margins of definition,
but it's not like the dictionary guys are knocking on my door for my opinion.
 too bad there's rules in the world.  one day it might be nice to decide
traffic lights are turnips with creamy centers.

In a message dated 1/13/2003 7:50:24 PM, you wrote:

<<is 'ekphrasis' limited to a poet's raections to art or an artist's reactions

to poetry?  I'm more interested in what the fruits (either poetic or

artistic) might be?  For example, if poet A writes poem A in response to

painting B, is there a C somewhere on the horizon?  This would then be a

collaboration?

and recently made one in flash
http://users.bigpond.net.au/mangolegs/kidzstory.html
which i also enjoy playing with. even though i made it, it still surprises
me. but i can't imagine sending its output to a public list. it's more of a
one-to-one experience of that moment.

unlike the poet googlism, your index-style poetry is not requested by the
end-user but it is what you, the author, of the poem or the code that wrote
it, have decided to give us, the end-user. and yes you can produce
voluminous quantities of this kind of poem.

i'm not saying your indices are not better crafted or scripted than
googlism's, merely that they are your offering, and as such contain you in
them. googlism allows you to detach yourself from any thought of the
author, and accept the index as being a valid sampling of thought or
comment. the newness of what googlism does is allow the end-user to ask for
the index that they want and then interpret it, a little like the i-ching.

i'm not sure where you are going with your other venture of sending out a
whole lot of code generated writing to email lists from your many personas,
but truthfully i stopped reading them a long time ago.

if poetry where just a matter of providing any words to any end-user and
asking them to not only interpret but to make associations between random
words then we could all just carry a dictionary and randomly choose words
ourselves.

my poetry may be gold plated excrement of the ibis or just dissolving
gerbil cysts, but it gives me pleasure, as i imagine your poetry gives you.
as a producer i am proud of my product. as a performer i learnt that if i
wanted to share my work i had to select work which i thought would give
other people pleasure as well. i did not perform too much experimental, or
too much work-in-progress poetry at readings and performances.

i encourage and support your endeavours, and i have not yet created a
filter for august highland, because i hope one day to see something truly
amazing emerging from your continual experimentation in this field.

Dear List Members,

I'd like to offer you a special deal on my new book THE YELLOW HOTEL =
from Verse Press (November 2002). The cover price of the book is $12, =
however you can get it from me, postpaid (book rate), for $10 total. =
(Overseas shipping or first class, you pay extra.) Backchannel me if =
interested. Review of book below. Incidentally, the cover art is by poet =
Michael Burkard.  I won't make any money on this----it's just one of =
many small efforts to get the book out there.

Thanks!

Diane Wald

a review of THE YELLOW HOTEL by Diane Wald    (From Publishers Weekly, =
Nov. 2002)


"Informality was queen. King?" Wald asks near the middle of her smart =
new collection, and she goes on to establish its curious reign: the =
Bohemianism of her open-ended poems and sequences charts a middle course =
between Steinian cadences and the chattiness of second- or =
third-generation Beats. Long-lined, multi-page efforts (some bordering =
on the conversational prose poem) venture out into the world with =
explanations that hazily invoke the autobiographical ("I awoke with a =
backache because of all this dreaming and boating") then veer into =
abstract territory: "Everything has become/ what it least expected." =
Wald's longer works can feel less like discrete poems than like =
journals, but they are compelling, inventive journals, full of "Ideas in =
bed/ and how they fled." While the sequence "The Fear As the Height of =
Folly" offers exceptional examples of attention to each word, other work =
(including the four-page title poem) promises exactly the opposite, a =
casual propulsion of attention (a la Bernadette Mayer) that renders =
ideas and images as they arrive. After decades of small-press and =
chapbook publishing (Wald's last collection, Lucid Suitcase, appeared =
from Red Hen in 1999), Wald offers not a debut so much as a comeback =
volume, and while she does participate in the jumpy humor common to much =
recent poetry, she also acts out a kind of confidence that remains hers =
alone: "Why don't you/ set out to do what you must in your own world and =
not worry about the rest." Readers will find Wald lives up to this =
dictum wonderfully.=20

Dust from hands long extinguished is as incoherent as
love. Long animals, those who have survived the
straits of retail, dapple in the shadows cast by angry
clouds.
        The anger of clouds swims a sky of long animals with
love. Love can only watch, just curious; the feedings
in the study, by light of screen...
        The anger of clouds frays the mouth on the moon's
uniform. The anger of clouds shakes off the last of a
tingling that lingers, empty as the memories of every
ex-lover she dreams about. In her dream she goes down
wind to meet the lake. The lake, eternally stippled by
markdowns, kisses open-mouthed the moon's uniform,
which can only reciprocate with more watchfulness,
tracing these handprints of dust on the screen.
        A stillness dapples in shadows cast by tingling;
blasted mornings softly ruffle  her hair. The moon's
uniform dapples in shadows cast by a stillness of
lake: traces of his sarcasm, ballooning purple and
dark;  helplessly, like spores.
        The moon's uniform is as incoherent as love.
        Blasted mornings run through my fingers, become
tingling in the hands. I can feel my body these long
nights without her stiffening to cliché. All the
clocks in every room here moan with fluorescent light.
        The moon's uniform swims a sky of unending blemishes:
dust from hands long extinguished; incoherent as
tingling. We would, the three of us, trade skin with
this petulant and salty night.
        Tingling freezes the eyes of a stillness.
        The moon's uniform is quieter than love.  Even love
can be drained, thinner than empathy and muddled
hoarse with thought. Angry clouds slim at every
corner: dust from hands long extinguished, fragility
softly ruffling his  hair.
        A stillness shakes off the last of the moon's
uniform.  If fragility frays the mouth on a  lake, the
anger of clouds slims at every corner, begging chance
to release it from seasons of onset.
        Love dumps  a labile wing all over, tingling. I
tingle all over.
        Only long animals do it this way.

first thanks for the fabbo happy post.
i'm reading, not a book of poems right now, but the huge bio of
stefan george that came out late last year.  it's not that great,
compared w/ some of the bios i've read (like edmund white's of genet,
which sets a v high standard) but very interesting nonetheless.  it's
always fun to encounter a weird and quirky character, even a
proto-fascist.  and even the clumsily translated bits of george's
poetry are quite breathtaking.

Can someone tell me where I can find the Olson quote - if it exists! -
where he says something to the effect that Black Mountain poetics "was all

oh, don't know about that, but Jonathan Williams, who studied under Olson at
Black Mountain, recently told me how Olson talked quite a bit about Elvis
during one class.  compared Elvis to certain taken seats in Olympus.  that's
nice.

The President has put out a request for feedback about war
with Iraq; if you'd like to register your opinion, here's how--
it's easy, and may count for something:

President Bush's White House Opinion Line: 202-456-1111.

Please make a call if you have a minute.=A0 The line only
accepts calls from 9-5 EST., Monday through Friday.=A0 A
machine will detain you for only a moment and then a
pleasant live operator will thank you for saying "I oppose"
or "I approve." It will only take minutes. Note that the
weekends are closed for calls. The president has said that
he wants to know what the American people are thinking.
Let him know.

Time is running out. Please forward this e-mail to as many
people as possible right away.

I can't find the quote, but here's a review of Robert Creeley that
communicates to some degree the spirit of the quote. Hope it helps.

Vernon Frazer

http://www.rattaymusic.de/releases/Cuneiform/Creeley.HaveWeTold.html


Besides his collaborations with visual artists, Creeley has also worked on
several projects with jazz musicians, a natural outgrowth of his life-long
interest in jazz. He has long acknowledged his debt to jazz. In her essay on
Creeley's early career, Cynthia D. Edelberg noted that:

"He learned from the jazz cult that "you can write directly from that which
you feel." These musicians, who experimented with rhythm and silence, showed
him "how subtle" and "how refined that expression might be." And in an
interview with Mong-Lan in 1999, Creeley stated that:

"In jazz I found much more instruction as to how to manage rhythm, how to
make a line, call it, and keep an active pattern "how to dance sitting
down," in Charles Olson's phrase. Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Thelonius
Monk, Bud Powell, Max Roach and many others before them and after were
really my source and instruction. There is so much emphasis put upon what
poems "are saying." Yet it is only in the way poems are "saying" anything
that I find them interesting. Otherwise love's love, eggs eggs, water wet.
"Listen to the sound that it makes," Pound emphasized, so I did."

Ekbert Faas's Creeley biography adds to the Olson/Parker thread.=20

pg 113: "'The Crisis,' he explained, gave he reader a sense of the =
speaker's anger. Altogether, this type of verse, with its various =
techniques of repetition, was based on rhythm rather than melody, =
analogous to the jazz of Parker, Miles, Chano, Roach, or Jackson -- or =
to the way Sebastian Bach 'managed the varioation of rhythm units.'"=20

pg 128: "Bach, 'the Bird,' and Williams ought to be enough for any poet =
-- Charlie Parker being granted the privilege of having exerted a =
greater influence on him than any other man, living or dead."

Of course, Olson figures prominently in the mix of Fass's remarks about =
RC and the jazz influences cited.

On the Ekphrasis line and the collaborative edge being probed--what to =
make of  collage in lieu of the flexible notions of collaboration & =
ekphrasis being pushed? Assimilation and appropriation of extant work, =
imagery, typographic bits, script, culture-crossing frags of language, =
artistic metamorphosis as the languages [visual or textual] move from =
the original [or reproduction of same] to the deriving artist.=20

Currently reading the Faas Creeley bio and SIGNS ON THE WIND =
(Pomegranate, 2002), a collection of postcard collages & other =
correspondence art of Lenore Tawney. Holland Cotter's intro gathers =
threads in a lovely comment that reads: "They can be read as treatises =
or as valentines. And 'reading' is literally what they invite. Every =
collage ornamented with words, in addresses, postmarks, stamps, =
inscriptions, printed texts. Many of the words are hard, if not =
impossible, to decipher: the manuscript pages Tawney uses are often in =
arcane languages and antique scripts; her own handwriting is sometimes =
so small as to be a species of micrography, with words and phrases spun =
out as little more than threads of black ink."

Tawney was part of the human mix of language-[though not =
L-A-N-etc]-probing NY mix that included her immediate neighbor neighbor =
Robert Indiana. Her collages  hint at a Dickinson recognition, using =
ED's commemorative stamp on a decidedly ephemeral postal collage mailed =
from Truro MA in 1971.

I don't have my Olson concordance handy (!) -- but I remember there was
also an interview in which somebody asked Creeley about what he and Olson
had in common and he answered, "Bird."

>Poets speak out against threat of war in Iraq

>MIKE HENTZ/The Citizen
>
>
>
>Poet Martin Espada is worried. The future is clouded with ominous
>signs of a possible war with Iraq. His 11-year-old son is having
>nightmares about being drafted and is approaching him with questions
>about war.
>
>"I persuaded him that he was not going to be drafted," Espada said.
>"But I'm not even sure what I was saying was true. I don't want him
>to grow up in a world where he will be drafted. War is not worth the
>blood of my son."
>
>Espada is not alone in his fears. Concern over possible United
>States action against Iraq tinted the 21st Key West Literary
>Seminar, and that prompted writers and poets involved in the event
>to sign a statement entitled "Poets for Peace." Seminar Board of
>Directors Chairman Irving Weinman, flanked by some of the nation's
>most recognized poets, read the statement aloud while framed by the
>backdrop of St. Paul's Church Saturday afternoon.
>
>The statement reads as follows: "We the poets and writers of the
>21st Key West Literary Seminar urge the United States Administration
>not to engage in an aggressive first strike against Iraq. Such a war
>would be unjust and result in the murder of innocents. We further
>urge the United States Administration to work towards the
>establishment of an independent Palestinian state, as only this will
>generate justice in the Middle East and stability in the world."
>
>The statement is affirmed by 31 poets and writers, including Derek
>Walcott, Nobel Prize winner for Literature; Richard Wilbur, former
>U.S. Post Laureate and Pulitzer Prize winner; Billy Collins, United
>States Poet Laureate; and Lucille Clifton and Robert Creeley,
>Chancellors of the American Academy of Poets.
>
>Weinman said the statement was not an official act of the seminar,
>but rather, an idea that came to fruition after discussions about
>the current political situation regarding Iraq began emerging among
>the contingent during the four-day event.
>
>"This is what we feel is the road to peace right now," Weinman said.
>"These are the terms. This is exactly what we want to say."
>
>Themes defined in the seminar often seemed correlated to the present
>tension, said writer Carolyn Forche.
>
>"All the poets are deeply concerned about the possibility of war,"
>Forche said. "We're coming to paradise, and we're deeply worried. It
>evolved into this statement."
>
>Describing her feelings about the details of the statement, Forche
>added, "This is not going to end until there is a Palestinian state
>outside of Israel, I do believe."
>
>Creeley said he finds no reason to invade Iraq. He said he questions
>the basis of preemptive war, and talked about the importance of
>public expression.
>
>"It's almost a forfeit of responsibility not to say something," he
>said. "All of us are universally implicated."
>
>Poets and writers pointed to tradition when asked about the possible
>decline in political activism among the nation's literary idols.
>Espada said the political engagement has "always been there, it has
>just been underappreciated." He cited past champions of cause,
>including Whitman, Langston Hughes, the poets of the Harlem
>Renaissance and feminist poets.
>
>"I think Whitman would be here with us today," he said.

nice quote from Pinsky:
"It amazes me that anyone could interpret this volume as supporting the
policies of the Bush administration, which I oppose and mistrust," Pinsky
said in an e-mail. "The climactic sentence of my essay concerns the
political exploitation of national grief, the sentimentalization that could
turn it into a 'murderous weapon.' "

may be so, but if so, it was something first explained to him Olson by one
R. Creeley (if my recollection of the correspondence is correct).

Locating the problematic: a >> the


I've got a problematic relationship to authority. Online, I think clearly,
Is theory necessary? Hardly; the best one can hope for is a problematic
but a problematic. Increasingly I felt overpowered, overwhelmed, not by
the placing of facts in a problematic world. Poetry is our great mirror;
imaginary within it, a fantasm procuring a problematic history. From a
problematic of electricity characterized by a problematic of internal
time-consciousness - time survival: "science," which not only plays into a
problematic Darwinism in search of the last term, a problematic terrain
which is neither even dysfunctional; it would retain a problematic auton-
omy. A problematic behaviorism in which function=>protocol AND with a
problematic ontological/epistemological regime, 'Environment.'

Its shadowy obverse. It is the field of the problematic that defines the
trope of an absent body, or dissipated in the problematic of the ring, the
problematic of the reader, ontology, community. As if this implied, auth-
entic or not, given among other things the problematic of phenomenology
that the problematic of text-based Internet communication - the _compon-
ent,_ and the problematic phenomenology accompanying it (just sign lan-
guage, the problematics of the verbal sphere). Additional gender confu-
sion, for the problematic of intellectual property, nervous walk to uni-
versity: rewriting the problematic of art and its wards, the problematic
of totality (Godel, Church, Skolem, Tarski, or for that matter Euclid), it
also precludes both the problematic of one past or through the problematic
of the proper name, which remains tied - the sunlight thick upon the
leaves, called out the problematic of "Medea22," of ballet. The problem-
atic of the real (grain of the voice, 'idiotic' real)? Breakdowns and the
problematic of mathematics. what crystalline mechanism description and the
problematic situating both, the fold catastrophe as towards the problema-
tic of the scapegoat and expulsion. the problematic:inscription: she is
doing her toilet...she breaks down and she says: "the problematic:ins-
cription" - she is doing her toilet...she notes towards the problematic
perception of worlds. This is an archaeology of taint, of plagiarism, of
the problematic, the problematic flesh and mind hinged on the edge of the
terminal. And all of this brings up the problematic of the net, where
passing, swimming in chaotic existence, the problematic of its being
present or refusing _all_ truths, including the problematic of its own
being...

re: Aids in Africa and Flash in front of the fire

Well, maybe the Flash piece is by Clemente Padin of Uruguay and =
Alexandre Venera of Brazil as at =
http://www.eale.hpg.ig.com.br/ppi/001.htm in their work PANPAZimagine. =
And you end up corresponding with Clemente and with Alexandre, or aLe as =
he calls himself, and you find, for instance, that they are working =
often with Regina C=E9lia Pinto of http://arteonline.arq.br in Rio =
which, you find, is an interesting site of North and South American =
writerly intermedia. And you link from there to other work from South =
America.

And eventually via these experiences and correspondence you end up =
collaborating with them or others on work that aspires to cross national =
and conceptual boundaries, media boundaries.

Eventually you find yourself in Brazil and we're not sure if you ever =
come back.=20

Or you stay where you are and see your work as helping people enter the =
more international perspectives on these and other issues including =
poetry and intermedia, maybe even Aids in Africa where there are also =
people doing intermedia on the Web.

One of the points being that it's very hard to do anything about Aids in =
Africa or X in Y if one's only connection to it is via media that one =
receives like a newspaper or a book or a television broadcast. =
Involvement in the art of the Web with other people around the world, =
who are involved directly in the things that interest you, or via email =
if that is your thing, is a way into a more substantial involvement in =
what interests you.=20

The art of the Web/net is not just about multimedia/intermedia but email =
and international collaboration...it can be participatory in these =
things or interactive along many axes...it isn't all American poetry in =
front of the fire or New York google/design db art.

Sometimes art leads us into deeper involvement with what we want to be =
on the planet to do.

ja

For my dear Samuel Pepys fan colleagues who recently
emerged during the blog blahs discussion (and who have
access to the island of Manhattan: private helicopter,
ruby slippers),---


This Friday, 1/17, 8 p.m. at the New York Society for
Ethical Culture, the group New York Collegium (viols,
etc.) presents an evening of

                 Samuel Pepys and music!

including (he was an amateur composer) Pepys' own
"Beauty, Retire."


Also, some Blow.


---with a 7 p.m. screening of a video of/from the
Pepys Library.

instruments of his, especially his wooden jack in his
chimney, which goes with the smoke, which indeed is

good-natured a man as ever I met with in my life, and
cannot admire him enough, he being so plain and
illiterate a man as he is."

That would be John Blow?

When I was reading the diary, god, 35 years ago, I was stopped in my tracks
by Pepys' mention that L'Estrange and Purcell had come over for an evening
of trios. Samuel played the gamba, if I mistake me not. To be a fly on that
wall!

DEAR AUGUST HIGHLAND,

THIS LETTER MAY
COME AS A SURPRISE TO YOU.
PLEASE ACCEPT MY HUMBLE
APOLOGIES IF I HAVE
CAUGHT YOU IN A PLANE
CRASH,
IN WHICH CASE YOU WILL
NEED TO AUTHENTICATE
YOUR INTEGRITY.
FIRST (EVEN THOUGH THIS
MIGHT SOUND STRANGE)
YOU SHOULD
KNOW THE TRUTH
ABOUT ME.
I AM A MILITARY
HARDWARE PURCHASER,
BUT I AM AT THE AGE
WHEN A MAN OF MY
FAITH IS PREPARED
TO RELINQUISH HIS
MATERIAL GAINS
FOR THE HIGHER ATTAINMENT
OF MOKSHA.
THIS IS MY SITUATION:
IF I CAN FIST YOUR
GRANDMA
(MY LAST FREAKY
VIOLATION OF EVERYTHING
I HOLD SACRED)
I WILL DISBURSE TO
YOU SIXTY MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS
THROUGH A SAFE ACCOUNT
PROVIDED THAT YOU DO
NOT DISCLOSE THIS PAYMENT
TO ANYONE
AND THAT THE DEAL
BETWEEN YOU AND ME
WILL REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL.
SINCE I SEEK FOR YOUR
UNDERSTANDING AND PRAY
TO GOD THAT HE WILL GIVE
YOU THE WISDOM TO UNDERSTAND
MY FISTING FETISH
WITH THE ELDERLY AND INFIRM
(A PERVERSITY I INHERITED
FROM MY LATE GRANDFATHER
WHO FISTED THE CORPSE OF HIS GREAT AUNT)
YOU WILL BE SURELY
BLESSED IF YOU CONCEDE
TO HELP ME BY ACCEPTING
MY GOODWILL PROPOSAL.

I HAVE YOUR CAT

IMMEDIATELY
(I CERTAINLY DO NOT
WANT TO BE CHARACTERIZED

I AM AWAITING YOUR URGENT RESPONSE NOW!
I DON'T CARE IF YOU
USE YOUR FORTUNE TOTALLING ABOUT

A number of interviews with Creeley exist online. While responding to this
thread, I saw two in which Creeley talked about Bird with Olson, and Olson
talked subsequently about "learning to dance sitting down." Although his
work helped open up the jazz possibilities within poetry, from what I know
of him and his work, I don't think jazz had the primacy with Olson that it
did with Creeley or Kerouac. Olson's lines tend to move in a slower, more
"classical" manner. Olson learned jazz, he didn't "feel" it.

Thanks Vernon and thanks to everyone who has been responding to this
thread.  Just to clarify, I don't believe that Olson's knowledge of jazz
was terribly deep and would agree with those who have suggested that what
he got he got largely from Creeley.  It's the fact that Olson would say
such a thing ("It was all Bird"), however off-handedly, which interests
me.  For those who don't know, Creeley's Collected Essays include
numerous, brilliant explications of the relationship between open field
poetics and jazz, and Nate Mackey's Discrepant Engagement builds on
Creeley's momentum in that regard. Still digging,  -m.

 =91Single-handedly, Tom Raworth has restored the value of quickness to=
 British poetry. His is the alacrity of Shelley, of Byron, of Gerard Manley=
 Hopkins, reinforced to meet a modern urgency. It is poetry of sensation,=
 intelligence flashing down the spillway, faster than thought.=92

At last the massive oeuvre of Tom Raworth's poetry is available in a single=
 volume. It will change our way of seeing British poetry, in particular the=
 modernist tradition.

 Tom Raworth was born in London in 1938. During the 1970s he travelled and=
 worked in the United States and Mexico, returning to England in 1977 to be=
 Resident Poet at King's College, Cambridge. Since 1966 he has published=
 more than forty books and pamphlets of poetry, prose and translations. His=
 graphic work has been shown in France, Italy, and the United States, and he=
 has collaborated and performed with musicians, painters and other poets.=20

Here is another of mJoan Fitgerald poems. She is one of my characters... =
 By the way, the heroin-dealer boyfriiend bit is not autobiographical, =
but I know someone (quire respectable) who dated a heroin addict...)


Letter to the Editor, New York Times: A Justification for War
"Saddam Hussein is a Mean Deceitful Bastard and a Thief and He Stole My =
Earring"

I cannot find my peace symbol earring--
the one I wear with anarchy on the other side
I have ransacked the house
almost as badly as the cops did
when they arrested my boyfriend
for possession with intent to sell
they slashed the mattresses
looking for powder or paraphernalia
but they didn't look in the cabinet
where he had clearly labeled a large box
with the word "HEROIN" in careful block letters
next to a smaller container marked "WORKS, individually wrapped"
he was what was known as a high class dealer
teaching the beginners the best ways to protect their veins
helping the old guys -- who were rarely older than 30 -- find a place to =
shoot up
despite years of abuse
he'd even do it for them
(he would have made an excellent phlebotomist)
even in the groin
all the while educating them on the risk of AIDS
he sold death but wanted to keep his customers undead
protecting his income stream
anyway he was the one who gave me the anarchy earring
which boyfriend after boyfriend I never lose
but the peace symbol I can never find
I bought it myself
to counteract anarchy
so it is not as precious, reminding me of no one
but me
and who cares about me?
but someone has taken it this time
I can feel in my bones
I think Saddam took it
he hates peace
I heard the president say so on TV
the president is a man of peace like Ariel Sharon
but Saddam is an evil, warmongering ball of slime
even Colin Powell hates him, and he likes everyone
only Saddam would be mean enough to steal my earring
right before my important meeting
they might lock me up if they see me wearing only anarchy
they might think my mind has no laws
and is careening around like the particles=20
in the first three minutes after the big bang
or like blood in a cement mixer
due to a misplaced arm in the machinery
and then I'd end up in the bin forever
sucking Haldolled juice out of a straw
after they beat me so bad they'd have to wire my jaw
or maybe they'd think I was sending a message to my confederates
(in grey uniforms all singing "Dixie")
the members of my Al-Qaeda cell
in which I plot to destroy the American way of life
but it is all a setup
Saddam's agents took my earring
they have people all over the world
they are in league with terrorists
they hate us because we are freedom-loving and god-fearing
they worship a false god
but we respect their religion
Islam is a religion of peace
we have nothing at all against Islam
it's just that all of its practitioners are cruel awful terrorists
who deserve to be exterminated
these evil people
climbed my fire escape
opened my window with a special silent method
taught in terrorist training camps in Afghanistan
they opened my dresser drawer
after spraying me with soporific gas
so I wouldn't wake up and see them
and sifted through my jewelry
looking for offensive items
the peace symbol stood for everything they despised
so they took it and made their exit
after cleaning everything up
and repairing the window
and spraying me with an antidote
they will bring the earring to Saddam
and he will wear it on his crossdressing days
or when he feels like wearing an earring on his left ear
to express the inner homosexual persona
which lives inside every het male
especially dictators and Arabs
who like to wear dresses and flowers in their hair
like poofs
anyhow
I hope president Bush moves forward with his war very soon
because I am eager to retrieve my earring
and I understand that American troops are expressly forbidden from any =
kind of looting
so I expect to be able to retrieve the earring when the presidential =
palaces are conquered
at least as soon as the booty has been inventoried
and appraised
I will be able to afford to repurchase my earring
if I am unable to prove prior ownership
because although it was said to be pure 18 carat gold
I got it for three dollars on Bleeker street
and it is hollow and the gold paint is wearing thin
I hope to be able to use these characteristics
to distinguish it from any other peace symbol earring
Saddam's men might have stolen
all over the free world
so please, George, attack the bastards right away
I have nothing to wear with my green suit
which I need to attend my commitment hearing
and George--
please send the earring to Bellevue
rather than to my apartment
as I am staying here for a while
to avoid the mess at home
of course I don't have the anarchy earring either
the ambulance guy wouldn't let me bring it
so can you tell the secret service to stop by my place and pick it up
when they come to bring the other earring?
my hearing is two weeks from Tuesday
I hope that gives you folks long enough to win the war

yours sincerely,
Joan Fitzgerald

A Moral Argument for Proving the Existence of Purgatory

       --Gerard Manley Hopkins, Pied Beauty (1918)

=20
If there is anything worth remembering
in this mortal coil, this roiling moil, this here-and -now now hiding =
heroes
far from the light of Herself, the tripartite Goddess of all
(the Daughter, the Mother, and the Holy Hag)
it will be those things most of the earth, most mixed,=20
most mediocre yet tinged with a shade of Grace:
tiny tutu-ed turbaned tots in dance class, in-terp-ret-ing Stravinsky's =
Rite of Spring
to their own lights.
Their teacher,
a believer in creative learning
and dance concerts which are not recitals
but events, (each one
as irreproducible as that experiment
linking sexual preference
to dancing skill
calibrated to the nearest hundredth on the Kinsey scale,
that once appeared
in the Journal of Irreproducible Results),
a kind of performance art
for those too young to pee on crosses naked
and evoke ire from clergymen and=20
Republicans.
Lest one condemn her pretension,
recall that she is not evil;
she is a spinster
of the classic sort,
secretly regretting
that she would not be fetching in a tutu,
looked at proudly as the pictures snap and flash
and the adoring grandparents clap
to see their relative so clad.
Nay,
she wears a black dress -=20
more of a shroud -=20
to attest to the burial of the good looks
she never had;
and one could hardly send her
to the One Below for that-=20
Why, He'd laugh at her
think her a toy, hardly worth
the more major tortures,
as even her sins are small
and insignificant.
But he'd find a way to make her suffer her Eternal Damnation anyhow:
put her in charge of the Kindergarten for Young Devils,
where good behavior is punished
and bad rewarded,
and students are encouraged to snitch and betray each other,
and turn in their teachers and other adults
to the Ideological Police
who make sure that Hell keeps its cardinal values.
She senses this,
and so has purchased no rope, eaten no poison, has avoided razors for =
any purpose other
than trimming her unsightly mustache.
She has vowed to stick it through=20
as she might say
in her Emotions Anonymous meetings
(invoking titters she does not understand).
Yet despite her efforts -=20
heroic in their intensity but pathetic in their results -=20
she is not a Good person.
She has seen a blind man crossing the road like a drunk
and she did not help him, for
he had no way of guessing at her ungenerous presence.
Yet she rolled the malodorous one-legged tobacco chewing guy
into Starbucks,
and bought him coffee,
to the disgust of the other patrons,
and it felt good,
because they knew from her sackcloth
that she was middle class, and therefore
only slumming in the company of the bum
for the sake of pure sweet Charity.
The sinful pride this public parade of virtue gave her,
converted good deed to bad.

It is for people like this
that the Goddess invented Purgatory
where our dance teacher
will form part of a typing pool for the angels
who have very exacting demands on their employees
she will take dictation from the one on High
and be denied the pure joy of seeing Her face.
She will be a word processor,=20
(that forgotten job of the Eighties)
rather than use one,
for eight hours a day with only two five-minute coffee breaks
and a twenty minute lunch.
She will be made to string paper clips,
and unstring them.
Unravel balls of rubber bands
that she will not be allowed to play with.
she will be made to wear pointy high heels and have bunions
and be unable to dance
but she will buy a season ticket to the ballet.
(Even this
will leave her lingering carnal yearnings
unsatisfied,
for as you may have guessed,
her section of Hell
is unisex.
Other cities of the damned exist
for tormenting the more lavender ladies:
parts of Hell populated by redneck males
and a limited number of devoted =20
(shared)=20
wives and girlfriends,
who spend whole days in church,
praying for their husbands to stop beating them,
and for the eternal souls of the
ho mo SEK-soo-alls
on earth
who are delaying Judgment Day
with their sinning ways)
A rare joy will be her aerobics lessons,=20
which are done in the airs above Below, dancing among clouds.
some day she will be deemed to have suffered enough

Hi all, with the help of Stephen Baraban I found the Olson quote we've
been talking about/around:

"And that there was a poetics? Ha ha.  Boy, there was no
poetic.  It was Charlie Parker.  Literally it was Charlie Parker."

This is in an interview in  Olson's _Muthologos_, v. 2, p. 71.  Mackey
also quotes it in Discrepant Engagement (which, it's always worth
reminding everyone, is available now in an affordable paperback from U
Alabama, as opposed to its former life as an unaffordable hardcover from
Cambridge).

Now of course the larger question of what the hell Olson meant or whether
he meant what he said.  Creeley the one to go to here.    -m.

"There is definitely something strange and a little bit disturbing about
Bob Graham's fetish for writing the most mundane and trivial details of his
day in a series of brightly colored 3x5-inch spiral-bound notebooks.
He jots down the exact time he dresses, eats breakfast and goes to the
bathroom. He memorializes the name of every person he's ever shaken hands
with or spoken to on the telephone. He keeps a record of the room number of
every hotel he's ever stayed in.
The notebooks are color-coded by seasons of the year -- red for summer,
yellow for fall, blue for winter and green for spring. And once one is
filled, it is carefully placed in an envelope and filed away.
The senior senator from Florida has filled thousands of these notebooks
over the last 25 years." -- Jim Defede, The Miami Herald, 1.14.03

Triptych: Three Stories of South Asian Women

a play by Summi Kaipa

January 24 & 25, 2003
Gallery opens at 7:30pm; Play at 8 p.m.
at Noh Space, 2840 Mariposa Street, San Francisco
reservation line: 415.864.6740
Tickets: $5 -10 (no one turned away for lack of funds)

also featuring a lobby gallery of works by
contemporary Asian American comic book and graphic novel artists: Lark
Pien, Thien Pham, and Jason Shiga

Triptych tells the stories of a 30-year-old corporate ladder-climber who
flees her top-rung job, a pair of teen siblings whose mothers recent
passing leads them to spiritual crisis, and a pair of best friends who
consider how their lives have or have not measured up to Barbies. Each
story focuses on women who are going through a crisis in their
lives,explains playwright Kaipa. The pieces are autonomous, but they are
wed together by the idea of falling,whether from their original dreams,
conflated dreams, or reality.

The play is directed by Vivian Giourousis with Set Design by Marisa Jahn
and Marijke Jorritsma. Lighting by Stephen Siegel.  Sound Design by Kirthi
Nath.  Performed by Kavita Bali, Amit Chadha, Mona Shah, Gopi Shastri,
Sapna Gandhi.

This project is supported by the Potrero Nuevo Fund, administered through
New Langton Arts.  It is co-presented by the Alliance of Emerging Creative
Artists and Asian Improv Arts.

Once you understand the discipline and complexity of what Parker did, and
that the syncopated rhythms of jazz happen to be the rhythms of the American
vernacular (listen to Kerouac reciting to jazz), Olson's quote (and
Creeley's) will make a lot of sense. If Parker's phrasing didn't open Olson
to projective verse, it expanded the possibilities of what projective verse
could be. Listen to the varying lengths of Parker's lines and look at
Olson's lines as you do.

This is very thought-provoking. Does anyone on the
list tell about experiences where artistic projects or
collaborations (not necessarily web-based but perhaps)
enabled you to politically involved with improving
material conditions? There was an interesting project
called "World Trek" that happened several years ago...

For numerical pleasures:

"Which country poses the greatest danger to world peace in 2003?

North Korea    8.8 %
Iraq    10.7 %
The United States    80.6 %

Total Votes Cast: 167484

NOTE: This is an unscientific, informal survey for the interest and
enjoyment of TIME.com users and may not be indicative of popular opinion"

You can still vote: http://www.time.com/time/europe/gdml/peace2003.html


It will be curious to see - undoubtedly Fox or the White House itself - who
steps in to create the poll that is "truly" "indicative of popular opinion.

Reminder - in San Francisco the Peace March starts as rally at 11 at Justin
Herman Plaza(Market and Embarcadero) and arrives at City Hall at 1 PM.

Poetry on foot! And, undoubtedly, great visuals.

Comrades,

I am writing a proposal for a radio documentary on Walter Benjamin. I have
to draw up a wish list of people who I would want to talk to. Right now
I'm aiming big (Eagleton, Jameson, Buck-Morrs, Steiner) and I have
contacted Marcus Boon (_The Road of Excess:A History of Writers on
Drugs_. Harvard UP, 2002) and a few other Canadians are in mind (Ian
Balfour and Rebecca Comay).

Now, I am going to contact C. Bernstein about Shadowtime (has anyone seen
it?) and I will look for information about Brian Ferneyhough. I gleaned a
list off of an ad for a book that I can't readily get edited by Gerhard
Richter (Benjamin's Ghost) but I don't know anything about any of them.
They are:

Norbert Bolz, Fritz Breithaupt, Stanley Corngold, Peter Fenves, Eva
Geulen, Miriam Hansen, Beatrice Hanssen, Lutz Koepnick, Tom McCall, Kevin
McLaughlin, Bettine Menke, Rainer Nägele, Gerhard Richter, Laurence
Rickels, and Sigrid Weigel.

Any help?

Finally, I'm wondering if anyone knows if Benjamin's writing for radio has
been translated,or even where to find it in German?

And more finally, can someone point me to any writing on Benjamin and
architecture or urban planning written by someone with training in the
fields?

Thanks to all!

Kevin

Dear Kevin

Here's something on the German painter Gerhard Richter that may be of
interest.  He creates paintings, as you know,  based on found and familiar
photographs, and makes the interesting statement that "I am suspicious
regarding the image of reality which our senses convey to us and which is
incomplete and limited."

Hi, Kevin -- I think Ferneyhough is at Stanford these days. I've had good
luck in the past tracking down faculty there by looking through the contact
lists on the website.

Subject: benjamin, walter


Comrades,

I am writing a proposal for a radio documentary on Walter Benjamin. I have
to draw up a wish list of people who I would want to talk to. Right now
I'm aiming big (Eagleton, Jameson, Buck-Morrs, Steiner) and I have
contacted Marcus Boon (_The Road of Excess:A History of Writers on
Drugs_. Harvard UP, 2002) and a few other Canadians are in mind (Ian
Balfour and Rebecca Comay).

Now, I am going to contact C. Bernstein about Shadowtime (has anyone seen
it?) and I will look for information about Brian Ferneyhough. I gleaned a
list off of an ad for a book that I can't readily get edited by Gerhard
Richter (Benjamin's Ghost) but I don't know anything about any of them.
They are:

Norbert Bolz, Fritz Breithaupt, Stanley Corngold, Peter Fenves, Eva
Geulen, Miriam Hansen, Beatrice Hanssen, Lutz Koepnick, Tom McCall, Kevin
McLaughlin, Bettine Menke, Rainer Nägele, Gerhard Richter, Laurence
Rickels, and Sigrid Weigel.

Any help?

Finally, I'm wondering if anyone knows if Benjamin's writing for radio has
been translated,or even where to find it in German?

And more finally, can someone point me to any writing on Benjamin and
architecture or urban planning written by someone with training in the
fields?

Thanks to all!

Kevin

RETURN TO ZINC BAR 2/9 to find:

Jim Behrle, featuring the release of new version 30.0
Sarah Manguso, in her last New York City reading of 2003

Jim Behrle is the author of 837 chapbooks. He is also the editor of can
we have our ball back? and the poetry editor of PINDELDYBOZ. This is
more than he wants you to know about him. He also is featured on the
syndicated radio newsmagazine "Here & Now." His 30th birthday is
2/8/03, and he's just started therapy. He doesn't live in Brooklyn,
*thanks* for bringing it up.

Sarah Manguso's first collection, THE CAPTAIN LANDS IN PARADISE (Alice
James) was named one of THE VILLAGE VOICE's Favorite 25 Books of 2002
and is currently being translated into Danish. Her poems have appeared
in the Pushcart Prize anthology, the Best American Poetry series, and a
bunch of journals. Her 29th birthday is 2/12/03, and she's been in
therapy since 1998. She lives in Brooklyn, in increasingly bad
neighborhoods.

(There may also be some wrestling between light heavyweight champ
Behrle and light geezerweight contender Larry Fagin, TBA)

Please find the Zinc Bar in Manhattan:
90 West Houston Street
(corner of La Guardia Place)
212 477 8337

Zinc Bar readings are hosted by Douglas N. Rothschild and are always
slated to begin at 6:37 PM, and I never really understood that joke.

Here's my quote du jour, from Pierre-Joseph Prudhomme, born this day
--15 January -- back in 1809:

"To be governed is to be watched over, inspected, spied on, directed,
legislated, regimented, closed in, indoctrinated, preached at,
controlled, assessed, evaluated, censored, commanded; all by creatures
that have neither the right, nor wisdom, nor virtue... To be governed
means that at every move, operation, or transaction one is noted,
registered, entered in a census, taxed, stamped, priced, assessed,
patented, licensed, authorized, recommended, admonished, prevented,
reformed, set right, corrected. Government means to be subjected to
tribute, trained, ransomed, exploited, monopolized, extorted,
pressured, mystified, robbed; all in the name of public utility and the
general good. Then, at the first sign of resistance or word of
complaint, one is repressed, fined, despised, vexed, pursued, hustled,
beaten up, garroted, imprisoned, shot, machine-gunned, judged,
sentenced, deported, sacrificed, sold, betrayed, and to cap all,
ridiculed, mocked, outraged and dishonored. That is government, that is
its justice and its morality!"

My friend Chris Winks is looking to sublet his apartment in
Brooklyn--largish one-bedroom at 1 Prospect Park SW, furnished (probably
filled with his many books), $1100/month--for four months, starting soon.
If you know of someone who's interested, call him at: 718/832-8649 or
cqw6841@nyu.edu
Thanks.

peeing on my mum


i pranced down a steep crag
or was it modest steps?
i can't remember

did i really pee on my mum?

a better search engine would help

"anticolonialist" is a strange phrase

to me this sounds too idyllic

maybe in a remote inaccessible valley
where all desires are rotten
and last minute unwarranted punishings
are applied through
paypal donations

hmmm

this seems a pretty general
commonplace sentiment

it's because of my education
in spurt starts

i do know what it means
though
to be a sleeping dictator
with a solarpowered handheld
and a satellite connection to
an autonomous sphere of
disconnected nodes

like figures moving on a nyc street
in analog footage
that are mixed with
kinesthetic filming techniques
to create an interactive traditional dance

i do know this

and what it means
    to pee
       on my mum

In case my opinion means anything, here's this:





Went to Granville Books and bought Ivan E. Coyote's new book, One
Man's Trash, published by Arsenal Pulp Press, and I have to say,
there is a publishing house with a head on its shoulders. I say get
out today and buy this book. ISBN 1-55152-120-2. It's $16.95 in
Canada and $13.95 in the US. If you can't find it where you are,
order it through your favourite independent bookstore. Ivan Coyote
writes a wonderful up to date prose with a comic hand and a sharp eye
to stuff that needs fixing. The stories take place during a Yukon
childhood, in present-day east side Vancouver, and on the highways.
Coyote never hits a bad note, and the sentences have you saying "just
right, that's just right." I remember thinking about Coyote's
characters: I can't believe these people--they are so real!

News line: 12/10/2002, The Following information was taken from a =
clinical trial conducted by
the American Anti-Avant Garde Society, Knoxville, Tn.  Click Here for =
Entire Study.



Hello,

My name is Dr. Don Johnson, President of the American Anti-Avant Garde =
Society.=20
Our well known and established organisation is constantly researching =
and=20
developing methods and products to slow down and even reverse the =
effects=20
of The Avant Garde. I'm writing to share with you an important medical =
breakthrough in=20
the treatment of Avant Garde.=20

Very recently, a product was released by the name of HGH.=20
This revolutionary product is clinically proven to reverse the Avant =
Garde process.=20
Many physical, mental and blood chemistry tests were performed=20
(Studying IGF-1 & HGH levels over 3 & 6 Month Periods). Our team=20
of scientists witnessed a stunning reversal in the human Avant Garde =
process!=20
The average IGF-1 level, (IGF-1 is the amount of Growth Hormone stored =
in=20
your blood which declines significantly with age), showed an increase=20
of 402.4 percent in our clinical trial, effectively REVERSING the Avant =
Garde Process! =20

This is an incredible result, completely unparalleled by any other HGH =
product=20
on the market today. Tests showed that people who had taken HGH=20
noticed significant results even in the first week. These results =
include:
=20

      =B7  New hair growth and color restored
     =B7  Increased energy levels
    =20
      =B7  Improved sleep and emotional stability
     =B7  Improved memory and mental alertness
    =20
      =B7  Increased sexual potency / frequency
     =B7  Controlled cholesterol
    =20
      =B7  Loss in body fat
     =B7  Increased muscle strength and size
    =20
      =B7  Reduced cellulite
     =B7  Wrinkle disappearance=20
    =20




Moreover, people have reported a significant increase in their energy =
levels, similar
to what they felt in their 20's.

HGH is not a Stimulator, Replacer, or a Steroid. It is a 100 percent=20
natural growth hormone Secretagogue, with a new active Homeopathic HGH =
Enhancer
in an easy to swallow capsule form. It can be absorbed effectively by =
the body to
reactivate your Dormant Pituitary Gland and give an Extra Boost of HGH =
into the=20
blood stream to be picked by the liver for conversion into IGF -1. This =
process=20
will start to reverse the Avant Garde  process at a much faster rate.

Click here now to find out more about this exciting product or visit us =
here


If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,

Dr. Don Johnson
President
American Anti-Avant Garde Society

naked healing

the old house was removed, the corners gone, though the shadows still
resonates they are elusive and hollow. endeavors multiply as ever, only
hints of its dialectical shadings are left. there is tellings of a
secret place. false like a fable. but encounters are accidental, names
are given with minds for certain themes, but even that now lays in ash.
a young slug on a stone takes no notice to the battles and birth
places, confined to leave a trail as the rest. starting from somewhere,
located just above the rest, advantages appear, the enemies cannons are
repositioned, the descending thought is dispersed. all returns to what
seemed like a quote.

    Hadj....Cloud View Rd...Hong Kong...has ordered 2 Dennis Cooper
items....He Cried & Little Caesar 10...this gets  me to excavate the 5 large
boxes of assorted po mags and books that i've buried in my off-SOHO storage
space...it takes me 5 minutes of alternately moving, pushing and shoving boxes
to get in...



    The first box has an an issue of both D.A. Levy's MARRAWWANNA REVIEW   an
early C Mag. with a Brainard cover...lying on top of an ANGRY PENGUINS..next
to ten copies of a Little Man spanish c.w. pamphlet....which gets to me to
thinkin' about the Po Lists nostalgia for OUR shared youth...and 60's mags....





     I was just here last week searching for a copy of George Montgomerry's
MARY JANE PAPERS...a d.a. levy production...and a copy of Levy's broadsheet
BALLAD OF NO BERETS...i found one and not the other and when I out of
boredomom looked at the D.A. Levy intro to Mary Jane...it was full of my
half-toothless octogerian friend Tuli...it was a match..and i recalled Tule's
description of Levy..'he was like a thousand other Jewish guys in the Village
in the 60's....but he was in Cleveland'



    Deeper into cultural darkness...i pass way on top of a mountain of milk
crates...a Color Silkscreen of John Lennon...done by the Po/Artist whose name
escapes me but who just died last week and whose death was posted by Pierre
Joris...I had bought it from the biographer of Andy Warhol whose name escapes
me...at a Street Fair...whose name escapes...while he was sitting next to
Terry Southern's widowed wife whose name escapes me...fame fugit...



     Miraculously the 2 Cooper's are in the same next box...but my eye strains
at a Harriet Zinnes book..AN EYE FOR AN I...i open it up & read the
inscrip..."For GEORGE BOWERING...with best wishes...HARRIET ZINNES...May 31,

notes from before


in an experimental course, a serial relationship shifts blue. precision
instruments chisel convenient circles to squares. of course even
balance waits in the corner of different objects, teasing various
numbers with reality components.

it is common in so far as in a mini museum of though, a serious of
problems arises, a claustrophobic fear is planted - theme and content
undescribed pop-up on the screen,  babbling turns to an idiot parade,
the fortunate self is ground down to a patty melt. all the work is
described in detail as an object paid for in advance with the number 5.

I'm considering putting up a page of links to the Top 10 Best Online
Poetry Sites. Your suggestions are appreciated; please e-mail me off-
list!

I'm not really interested in personal sites, nor "publishers" where you

poets Rachel DuPlessis and Frances Sjoberg

Saturday, January 18, 7pm
Dinnerware Gallery, 135 East Congress
Admission: $5; Students $3


Additional Event: Rachel DuPlessis will present a paper, "Manhood and its
Poetic Projects: the construction of USA masculinity in the counter-cultural
poetry of the 1950s,” on Friday, January 17, at 2pm, Modern Language room
451, at the university; this event is free and open to the public (for
directions phone POG at 615-7803).  (C0-sponsored by UA English & Arizona

Rachel DuPlessis, Professor of English at Temple University, is known as a
feminist critic and scholar with a special interest in modern and
contemporary poetry, and as a poet and essayist. In 2001, she published two
books: Genders, Races, and Religious Cultures in Modern American Poetry,
1908-1934 (Cambridge, 2001), a work of literary criticism, and Drafts 1-38,
Toll (Wesleyan University Press, 2001), a collection of her long poems.
Between 1980 and 1998, she published six other books of poetry and two
chapbooks. DuPlessis is also the author of Writing Beyond the Ending:
Narrative Strategies of Twentieth-Century Women Writers (1985), H.D.: The
Career of that Struggle (1986), both from Indiana University Press, and The
Pink Guitar: Writing as Feminist Practice (Routledge, 1990). She is the
editor of The Selected Letters of George Oppen (Duke University Press,
1990). DuPlessis has also published three coedited anthologies, reflecting
her interests in feminism, gender issues in modernism, socially-inflected
readings of poetry, and the poetics of contemporary poetry. These are The
Objectivist Nexus: Essays in Cultural Poetics, with Peter Quartermain, from
the University of Alabama Press (1999); The Feminist Memoir Project: Voices
from Women's Liberation, with Ann Snitow, from Three Rivers/Crown (1998);
and Signets: Reading H.D., with Susan Stanford Friedman, from the University
of Wisconsin Press (1990). DuPlessis's work in poetry and in the essay form
has been discussed in recent books by Lynn Keller, Burton Hatlen, Hank
Lazer, and others. In 1990, DuPlessis held a Pennsylvania Council on the
Arts grant for poetry, and in 1993, was honored by the Fund for Poetry. She
received Temple University's Creative Achievement Award in 1999. In 2002,
DuPlessis was awarded the third Roy Harvey Pearce / Archive for New Poetry
Prize, given biennially to an American poet/scholar who has made a
significant lifetime contribution to American poetry and literary
scholarship. In 2002 she was awarded a Pew Fellowship in the Arts for her
work in poetry.

Frances Sjoberg was born in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan in 1973. She received
a B.A. from the University of Arizona in 1994 and an M.F.A. from Warren
Wilson College in 2002. She serves as an ad-hoc member of the Board of
Directors for Kore Press, a non-profit literary arts press. Her publications

Good afternoon,

I must say that Mike Heller must have 20 people watering his plants and
feeding his cats. Everybody seems to know that he is in France.

The reason I was looking for him is because he wrote an opera on Benjamin
that was mounted at the Philly Fringe in 2000. I thank Kent Johnson for
the lead on that. Ellen Fishman Johnson did the score.

For your pleasure here is a brief review from an on-line thing.

This piece, an opera based on the life of German-Jewish thinker Walter
Benjamin, integrates live and recorded music to impressive effect, but the
libretto is unimaginative, academic and lugubrious. To enjoy the piece you
probably have to like modern opera and share the librettist^Òs view of
Benjamin as a tragic hero. ^×Lucien Crowder

If I haven't gotten back to you to thank you for assistance, I will.

bests,
kevin

yes, brion gysin that is. i just got the fantastic "lunapark 0,10" CD
that has a recording of gysin performing this piece and it instantly
made me think of the steve lacy song "no baby." i know lacy
collaborated with gysin on at least one recording, but any lacy heads
out there know if there's a direct connection between this gysin piece
and the lacy song?

thanks,

kev,

english translations of some of the radio scripts can be found in
volume 2 of the harvard UP selected writings. i don't have it at hand
and so can't tell you exactly what's there. but if you can get that and
poke around in the intro/footnotes/etc i think you'll find there a
pretty good account of what's where in the german.

In  sympathy with Senator Bob Graham's project, I am sure many of us can
name a few poets (many distinguished) who left ample records of their
traces, shoes and all. As an occasional astonished and fascinated reader of
Alan Sondheim, maybe, I am thinking, Bob Graham could up his act with a
Sondheim apprenticeship - where he could learn to inscribe the
micro-modulations, velocities and tones of Senatorial speeches, cross-
patterned voices, and physical gesturesof his fellow colleagues. A total
de-framing of standard reportage on "the Chambers."

 Or, I forget the guy's name(?) on the List, who is experimenting with
registering every thought, or every spoken word within a particular space
and time. A Senator's record on that level would probably be mind blowing.
How does such a mind mix no taxes on dividends, invading Iraq, no child left
behind, pre-empting (pre-emptying?) or starving North Korea, "fundamentally
flawed" diversity programs, imagining how to protect the populace from the
potential free flow of nuclear dust,  a direct ear full from Donald
Rumsfeld, etc. etc. I think would be an astonishing and informative record
to reveal in language, color and image. In light of that traffic, I can also
imagine re Graham, that its much uch more assuring and maybe sane no doubt
to remember the numbers on your hotel rooms, the colors of the bathroom
soaps, video title  rentals, etc.

Yet, in truth, when we look at public life on any political level, it's the
absence of either poets and artists  on any meaningful level public
discourse that perhaps makes it attractive to ridicule Senator Graham and
his project. And maybe envy?  We - individually or as a group - are rarely,
if ever, brought to the table to witness, address an issue and provide
another angle of vision. As a practice (multiple as they may be), poetry is
basically marginalized, or not acknowledged as an ingredient in the
political building and decision making process.  (Interestingly, Richard
Kamler, a sculptor/conceptualist friend, currently is developing a project
at the United Nations for an event  at the Headquarters in which each member
country's delegate will bring one of its artists "to the table." A symbolic
event but aimed at a more core question.)

Off at the margins, if poets are interested, it seems we can only, at best,
shout to the center. Or, as in Creeley's willingness to participate in the
State Department anthology, a desire, if not an insistence, to be considered
as part of the national/international equation. In Creeley's case obviously
not with any intention to relinquish his opposition to the War.

a response to a post earlier this week from Lewis Lacook:

my comments are preceded by a "***"

AUGIE SEZ:there really is no separation between the
writer and the source text

*** this might be true, and the very negation of this claim might also be
"really" true (that there is a complete separation between the writer and
the source text). "really" implies some sort of god-like access to the
metaphysical relationship between writers and "their" texts.  You or augie
might have such access to metaphysical information; that is to say, you
MIGHT just be gods with such priveleged views, but I am not exactly
convinced of that.

and the code that is written to generate the resultant
text

all boundaries between the writer and the source text

and the code that is written to generate the resultant
text

are artificial constructs


***again, knowing whether these things are "artifical" or "real" requires a
priviledged god-like metaphysical view which i beleive no one here is likely
to possess.

the source text the code the resultant text

are all self-extensions of the writer

***again, maybe, maybe not.  it is certainly a social norm to say that a
writer and her writing are one, and it might also pay for poets to make such
self-ist/author-ist claims, but are those reasons compelling enough on their
own?  no, of course not.

(and vice versa the writer is an extension of the
collective self)

***here you continue to develop some sort of faith-based (unverifiable)
model of the relationship between author, community, and text.  every claim
you have made is completely untestable and beyond the scope of any rational
discourse (please note that "rational" does not necessarily preclude
emotion).  i'd like to think that we are all one together on some sort of
cosmic couch or gnostic ephemeral wireless cognitive network, but discussing
such thoughts is like discussing who in heaven Jesus spoke with first after
he ascended on the thrid day.


all language is code, really, from the standpoint of semiotics:signs and
symbols, kids:::we can't escape
it:::so, in reality, there's no difference between a
computer generated poem and Kubla Khan:::one was made
by a dream wrapped in a machine, a dream designed to
make itself flesh:::the other was made by a dream
wrapped in laudenum, and it too strove to make itself
flesh:::::::


***this is true only if semiotics IS reality.  again, nice try, but your
reasoning does not appear to be very careful.  there IS a difference between
Kubla Khan and a computer-generated poem (there are many but one in
particular is glaring).  There is no difference only if we 1.  take a purely
semiotic point of view and 2.  ignore the fact that Coleridge neither was a
computer nor 3.  further it has yet to be proven that human language can be
perfectly modeled by a computer.  i'd say that until we have non-Turing or
Quantum computers, there will remain a glaring difference between human
language and human language modeled by any computer: ther generation of
rule-violations.  One way of saying this is that if language is
rule-generated, then how do errors happen in language generation all of the
time?  Our answers to this question will underscore differences between
human language and its representation in binary.  Another way of saying this
is that perhaps language and brains in general are not essentially based on
rule-following schemes, and that the best we can do with computers is MODEL
or approximate it.  human intelligence is adaptive; a program might pass a
turing test 100% of the time on first view, but after, say, it is witnessed
100 times, or 500 times, or even twice, that intelligence.

***you and yours seem to be taking what is known in the trade as the strong
AI view.  numerous critiques of the strong AI view abound in the
philosophical literature.  John Searle (of the "chinese box" fame) is one of
the better philosophers to read to read, particularly his "The Rediscovery
of the Mind."

***(yes, of course we can write rule-bound adaptive and learning models,
genetic algorithms, etc., but those models are still mediated by humans.)

***the difference between codework and the text poet: rules, speed, origins,
media, production.  if we ignore the means of production, as you seem to
suggest is a rational thing to do, then this sounds creepily like
capitalism, that we should all ignore the means of production and focus
solely on the produce itself.

***of course these lines are blurred in the middle: a poet might use
programs as a tool to produce poetry out of data poetically selected, or
might insert code-generated statements inside a non-code generated poem.
sure sure.  but you're talking about "really" and "aritifical" and so forth,
and so if we are to speak in terms of the pith of these things it's hard NOT
to see the differences.


what's the difference between cage's use of the I
Ching in composition and the hyperpoet's use of the
machine? both are using chance operations,

***actually no.  the best someone can get with a program is pseudorandom
numbers.  computers can only approximate randomness.  there's a big
difference between the chance operations of Cage and the hyperpoet's
modeling of chance operations.  there's a big difference between a map of a
town and the town itself.

which is a
way of talking with the universe::::and how are(to my
mind, THE greatest poems ever written) Berrigan's
sonnets different from algorithmic texts? or the work
of Gyson and Burroughs?******************/

*** they were not generated by algorighms, for one.  an algorithm is a
computational procedure for solving a problem in a finite number of steps.
there's some algo-like stuff in their works, but it is hardly ALL
algorithmic, or strictly algorithmic even in parts (there are clear
departures from the condition of "finite steps").  not to mention the art
involved that is likely NEVER to be programmable.

*** i love those works myself; I would never have been a writer were it not
for learning of chance operations and the cut-up.  but I would never have
been a writer had I not also learned that confounding thing known as the art
of writing.  just cutting up a text ain't good enough.  an artist's eye
needs to go back and find the gems.  OK, burroughs didn't claim to do that,
but it seems to me he did do a little cleaning up, and it also appears to me
that he did more than cut-ups.  (dodie bellamy's cunt-ups on tender buttons,
by the way, is a wonderful example of when the fuctional methodology of
cut-ups meet with a strong sense of art, for art is on some level a censure
of society's proprieties, and bellamy's book is rife with wonderfully
dangerous improprieties).


PATRICK SEZ:

*** I think you mean Lester, not me.  I am not Lester.

So many people seem to be working hard to
reduce people to machines while elevating machines to
the status of people... 2053 will be glorious year
because people and machines will finally be equal! And
yet people will not be equal among themselves....
Making people less wonderful and machines too
wonderful. Which will be the function of a priveleged
few PEOPLE. Somewhere in that model is someone trying
to *sell* you something, some bag of goods that you
might not want, that will *lessen* you, *reduce* you,
once you get it off the showroom floor and take it
home.......Computers don't get inspired. They don't
feel chills in their spines.......I think that the
viewpoint espoused by Bok has a shelf-life, that it
faces some amount of reckoning, that it will
eventually be subject to contextualization and review.


/*************this is the usual reaction to this
question...


***  this is quite a disingenouous first reflection.  by "usual" do you mean
to suggest that it is bad?  maybe if so many people are saying this, maybe
they are right (the roots of democracy).  by the way, I haven't found anyone
else saying this except for a very small handful of people--keep in mind
Lester's position appears not to be Luddite in any way but instead aimed at
deflating the hype.  I can name a few who share similar positions, but they
are not many in number, and to me seem far from usual.  most people in
america at least just buy the hype, they go with it.  Lester tells me that
he arrived at 2053 using a "dynamical Monte Carlo method for stochastic
poetry models."  He claims that he "checked the solutions self-consistently
with a stochastic version of the Euler method & also analyzed the results
under the herd-immunity concept."  With a computational model of remarkable
mathematical clarity and complexity, he arrived an an exact figure.

***Is there anything poetic about "2053"?  Yes.  The irony of it!  Not the
year itself, taken literally.  Lester knew that.  And he's a dummy.


....as far as i can see, it's not about making
machines and people equal, anymore than previous tools
were about making, say, pencils and people
equal....

*** i agree that the computer is just a tool and not any privileged sort of
miracle worker.  Au contraire, I think your own rhetoric about codework and
language seems to be in disagreement with the notion of the computer as a
tool.

the computer is, like all media, an extension
of the human mind....(someday biographers will study
the structure of artists' machines, and artists'
computers will be displayed in the dead museums)....

how is using a tool comparable to selling anyone a
bill of goods?

*** the quote i was addressing was "We may exalt the poets of the future not
because they can write great poems, but because they can program devices
that can write great poems for us."  that is to say, I was taking aim at the
view that the machines would do the writing.  the player piano has been
introduced but the great piano player is not the great piano roll writer.
the great pianist is still the great pianist.  and the great writer will
still be the great writer, or at least i hope.  for if programmers become
poets, poetry will become QUITE dull and will cease to be what makes it so
special: that it is an art, that it is a censure against society's
propriety.  one of society's proprieties right now is to be a good
programmer.  yet an improriety is to be a poet, particularly to be a poet,
say, like gabriel gudding.  his improrieties in his new book alienate both
the avant garde's sense of propriety and the new formalist's sense of
propriety.  not to mention that his book might upset all the children in
collegiate born-again christian organizations.  what bok is suggesting in
his quote is something beyond a tool.  and your own quote about a computer
being an extension of the human mind, if taken literally, suggests that all
media is something beyond a tool.  for it is beyond any tool to be an
extension of mind.  figureatively, yes, I agree, but not literally.  tools
are of the third-person verifiable world, yet mind is something not
altogether apparent as a part of a world that can be defined in terms of
physical properties.


hell, patrick, it often seems to me
that those who espouse more print-based work and
deplore hypermedia are just as careerist and elitist
and trend-mongering as any of the net artists out
there ////truth is, no tool is good or bad in itself,
it just is....

***um, lester, you mean.  neither lester nor I take the position that
computers are any sort of exceptional technology.  in fact, you can read how
I envisioned proximate.org as a tool to underscore the commonalities between
the technologies of text and the internet, and how the internet merely
exagerates (and renderd dangerous) some of the problems with text.  like,
for instance, how people can subjugate people through confrontational
language...the internet compounds this viral problem because 1. there is one
subject behind the multitude of statements and 2.  the volume of statements
(and transitively, the volume of subjugations) has no upper limit.  with
books, there are all sorts of problems that prevent the verticality I
described as well as the volume of production.  my criticism of computer
technology, in particular, language on the internet, is that it can be used
to deploy/engineer control on a leven never yet seen on this planet.  we
already have loads of evidence that the internet can (and does) do this.

***merely trumpeting some poetry work based on its formal proerties alone
only contributes to the illusion of novelty and convenience, that all is
well, when it might not all actually be so well.

privilege? i'm not so sure...if you're talking about
the learning curve involved, consider this: i didn't
go to school for computer science...i learned what i
know of code on my own (as i learned much of what i
know about poetry on my own):::and here's the
clincher, kids:::I COME FROM A LOW SOCIO-ECONOMIC
BACKGROUND::::::


***and to be frank your socioeconomic background explains in part why you
might not know exactly how to engineer such a vertical poetic system...it
takes capital investment...the dominant programmer is something altogether
different from the dominant poet.  though you do share your enthusiasm for
it.  you haven't had the education, the time in school learning the
mathematics or using the high-end equipment needed to perfect such a
vertical system.  programming is a very vertical world.  potentially.  there
are wonderful community aspects about rhe programming world, but most of my
experience in high-end exotic programming systems (and real poetry machines
of the sort Bok seems to suggest) comes from working with people who have a
LOT of money.  We're talking Ford, Verizon, Avaya, HP, Lockheed, etc.  They
have the tools you need.  and they're not losing control.  they're getting
it.  programming takes years and resources to learn, while poetry can come
at a moment's notice.  there's overlap, but there are also regions of each
realm that do not overlap.

***but if we are to make the domainant programmers the dominant poets it
will change the face of poetry COMPLETELY and squeeze out what is poetic
about poetry.  machines are not sexy, unless of course you like to get it on
with a telefunken u-47 or a toaster every now and then.

anyone who wants to learn this stuff
can, the books are out there:::::anyone who wants
these tools can find them if they want to,
peer-to-peer trading of software is common:::::::one
can get a decent used machine for less than one would
expect:::so where's the privilege, patrick?

***$400 for a computer, $50 for high speed internet connection PER MONTH,
$30-50 for JUST 1 programming book.  a good basic education.

***and that's just to be a dilettante programmer.  that's a lot of money.
not to mention TIME.  for a shitload of people, they simply can't afford the
time or the additional bills.  and public education in the inner city isn't
going to equip too many people with the ability or opportunity to sit down
at home and teach themselves Java.  While for you or me that's not so much
money, it's way too much money for more than half of all Americans.  And
we're not even touching on any sort of comparison to those in the third
world countries.

and no, the computer can't feel::::no more than the
pencil or pen feels:::as i pointed out, it's a tool,
even when prompted to generate::::does the pen get
inspired? did the typewriter? there's still an artist
behind it all

***is an artist still an artist of the artist ceases to produce art and
instead participates only in computational science?  it's not a necessary
schism, but it is a possible one, and one that people should be WARY of.  I
think Lester's argument is a bit more subtle than the cartoonish
interpretation presented here.  i do have the money (don't get me wrong, I'm
not rich, but I can afford to go to a good school, and take the time to
learn, REALLY learn, computer science and mathematics), and i do study this.
and one day i might be that programmer/poet that bok talks about.  who
knows.   i just hope that if it does happen i can remember the difference
between poetry and programming, because there's a huge difference.  and for
anyone else who might fill that seat bok speaks of, well, I hope they can
hear what I'm saying, what Lester is saying, and not merely hear the bits
they want to hear and dispel the rest.

***don't beleive the hype


::::and why are we talking about
nineteenth century concepts like inspiration ANYWAY,
here in the 21st?

***inspiration is, like, so passe?  wha?

***see what I mean?  what's poetry got to do with fashion?  for you, perhaps
much more than it does for me, it appears.

***this is getting to be a pissing contest, but hey, I'll piss.  It seems to
me that you are caught up in something, that you have a Movement to
Vanguard.  There are Manifestoes to be written, yes?  Fluffernutter.
Doesn't it feel a little silly?

***I like the old guys and even adhere to a sort of classical view.  I've
read way too much borges.  heh.  there's a difference between what is said
and how you say it, and just because you found a new way to say it doesn't
mean you've said anything new.  it's all been said before.  right on,
borges.  and inspiration will never pass out of style.  inspirare, to
breathe in.  breathing, living, feeling life, is hardly fashion.  it is the
very stuff of poetry.  by your ignorance of the difference you help squash
the very essence of poetry and contribute exatly to the sort of thing lester
describes in his flogspot.  practically, i know what you mean, but
inspiration is hardly the exclusive domain of romanticists.


All due respect, of course...it's just that these
knee-jerk reactions to issues like this are tiring,
and all to often ill-informed and ill-thought-out...


***i don't see how aligning lester's analysis with "these knee-jerk
reactions" shows any amount of respect at all for me.  further, if anything,
your position seems ill-informed to the point that it sounds rote.  so let's
drop the disingenuous rhetoric about respect.  i  choose to be frank
instead.

***and you must mean "all too often" not "all to often" since we are now
pissing.

*** all i am saying is that's let's be a little reasonable and tone down the
hype.  the hype is occluding what it is to be a biological system, what it
is to be a human, and what it is to write poetry.  and it is also occluding
what it is to be a computational system.  there is overlap (venn diagram,
anyone?) to be sure, but the hype blows out of the water any consideration
of what does not overlap.  further, humanity is being relentlessly
mechanized to the point that the entire world faces socioeconomic disaster.
life is way out of whack.  such hype about programming and poetry only
contributes to this looming peril.  let us use tools, but let us 1.
understand what it is they do and don't do 2.  keep them under our care 3.
let machines do what machines do well and let people do what they do well
and 4. let us not forget what poetry is, at least, those of us who "get it"
on some level.

***berrigan's poems have as much to do with ted's fucked-up life and
remarkable (inspirational!) navigation through it as they do with their
formal properties.  actually, they will be remembered only if people
remember what they say at least as well as how they say it.  poets might one
day program, but they will also still write, they will still determine what
it is they want to say and how it is they will say it.  even if a computer
is involved.  so with bok's quote, i disagree.

                        New York: Sixteen Months After

                                Eliot Weinberger

_11 January 2003_: For years they'll be debating the future of the empty
pit where the World Trade Center once stood, with fantastic or hideous
proposals of gardens in the sky or indoor lakes or threatening
tic-tack-toe-shaped fortresses. But at the moment, the only thing certain
is the fate of the actual towers themselves. The scrap steel will be
shipped from the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island to the Grumman
shipyard in Trent Lott's fiefdom of Pascagoula, Mississippi. There, it will
be melted down and turned into the "New York," an $800 million "state of
the art" amphibious assault ship. In Bush America, every ploughshare must
be beaten into a sword.
        War and war and war. 150,000 troops are massed in the surrounds of Iraq,
many of them reservists pulled from their normal lives, preparing for what
the Pentagon is already declaring the "greatest precision-bombing aerial
assault in history," to be followed by an invasion which the United Nations
estimates will cause 500,000 causalties. There are troops or "advisers" in
India, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgzystan, Georgia, the Philippines,
Colombia. . . and speculation that Iraq is merely a stop on the road to Iran.
        Military operations in Afghanistan are continuing at a cost of a billion
dollars a month-- compared to the $25 million a month the U.S. is spending
there on humanitarian aid, most of it paying for the offices and
maintenance of the aid workers, or vanishing into the crevices of local
corruption. Helmeted and armored Special Forces troops still move like
Robocop through the villages, past the hundreds of thousands of displaced
peasants trying to survive the winter.
        This year, the Pentagon budget will increase by $38 billion to almost $400
billion. The increase alone is practically the entire budget of the
second-biggest military spender, China. Meanwhile, millions of Americans
have lost their jobs or have had their salaries greatly reduced. There are
schools around the country that will be closing a month early this year
because of budget cuts, further evidence of the theory that Republicans
never allot any money for education in order to keep the electorate stupid
so that they'll vote for Republicans.
        Everything is war and war, the talk of war, while the real, declared warˆ-
the War on Terrorismˆ- is a complete failure. It could not be otherwise:
One cannot, by definition, wage a military (and not metaphorical) war
against terrorism, for the terrorists themselves are not waging a war. Wars
are fought to coerce an enemy to accept one's policies or sovereignty. Even
when they involve the mass slaughter of civilians-- as has been
increasingly the case since World War I-- they are not terrorism. (A
Palestinian suicide bombing, however repulsive, is the act of a civilian
combatant in a war of independence.) Terrorism is committed by small,
clandestine, independent groupsˆ- the evil twins of NGO'sˆ- in the attempt
to persuade like-minded people to join their side, whether physically or
intellectually. The massacre at the World Trade Center was, in terms of the
United States, a means without an end: There were no grounds on which the
U.S. could admit "defeat"; the only possible "victory" for al-Qaeda was a
sympathetic response from within the Muslim world.
        In a revenge-seeking and deliberate confusion of host and guest, the U.S.
military easily overthrew the essentially unarmed Taliban regime, leaving
vast areas of the country in the hands of warlords, and partially restoring
the freedoms (music and television, women without burqas and girls in
school, clean-shaven men) which the Afghans had enjoyed under that
oppressive Soviet occupation the U.S., through its fundamentalist
surrogates, the Taliban, had fought so long. [Freedom, however, only goes
so far: A few days ago, a political cartoonist was thrown in prison for
mildly satirizing President Karzai.] The country is in ruins, but the
pipeline from Kazakhstan has now become a reality, and its plans are drawn,
the fulfillment of an old dream among the Bush crowd. As Dick Cheney said
in 1998, when he was CEO of Haliburton: "I can't think of a time when we've
had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as
the Caspian. It's almost as if the opportunities have arisen overnight. The
good Lord didn't see fit to put oil and gas only where there are
democratically elected regimes friendly to the United States. Occasionally
we have to operate in places where, all things considered, one would not
normally choose to go. But we go where the business is."
        The War on Terrorism has been good for business, but hasn't done anything
bad against the terrorists. With one possible exception (an Egyptian
strategic planner), not a single important al-Qaeda member has been killed
or captured. George Bush has not mentioned the name"Osama bin Laden" in six
or eight months, and no wonder: He may think he's Wyatt Earp, but those
evil-doing Clanton Brothers aren't playing by the rules and they never
showed up at the OK Corral. So all Bush can do is just shoot at anybody who
looks mean.
        After all, al-Qaeda-- once one strips away the propaganda-- appears to be
a group of, at most, a few hundred educated, middle-class fanatics, who
masterminded terrorist actions, mainly in Africa, at the rate of one every
eighteen months. They also ran camps in Afghanistan for thousands of young
peasants attracted to local jihads, including 5,000 trained by Pakistani
intelligence for incursions into Kashmir and 3,000 Uzbekis attempting to
overthrow the dictatorship in Uzbekistan (which receives hundreds of
millions of dollars in U.S. military aid). It is these Afghan and foreign
peasants, Taliban foot soldiers and jihadis, that the Bush Team has labeled
"al-Qaeda terrorists" and left to rot in Guantanamo Bay (in cages, by the
way, identical to the one in which Ezra Pound was placed in Pisa in 1945).
Al-Qaeda, as the recent bombings in Kenya prove, continues as it did
before. Forced out of Afghanistan, it is merely less visible.


There is indeed a malevolent "sleeper cell" in the United States, but it is
not the one in Attorney General John Ashcroft's apocalyptic imagination. It
was formed in the 1970's, in the Ford Administration, by Donald Rumsfeld,
then as now Secretary of Defense, and his young disciple, Dick Cheney, whom
Rumsfeld got appointed as White House Chief of Staff. During the Reagan
years they attracted brilliant young ideological extremists: Paul
Wolfkowitz, Richard Perle, Eliott Abrams, Zalmay Khalilzad, among them. In
1992, the last year of the Bush Sr. administration, convinced, as everyone
was, that Bush would be reelected, and hoping for a second-term purge of
the multilateralists surrounding the President, they launched their first
secret manifesto: "Defense Planning Guidance for the Fiscal Years
1994-1999," written by Wolfkowitz and Khalilzad, under the direction of
then Secretary of Defense Cheney.
        According to their "Guidance," with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
"first objective" of the United States was now "to prevent the re-emergence
[sic] of a new rival":
        "The U.S. must show the leadership necessary to establish and protect a
new order that holds the promise of convincing potential competitors that
they need not aspire to a greater role."
        We must "discourage" the "advanced industrial nations" from "challenging
our leadership."
        "We must maintain the mechanisms for deterring potential competitors from
even aspiring to a larger regional or global role."
        "We will retain the pre-eminent responsibility for addressing. . . those
wrongs which threaten our interests. . . Various types of U.S. interests
may be involved in such instances: access to vital raw materials, primarily
Persian Gulf oil; proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
ballistic missiles, threats to U.S. citizens from terrorism. . ."
        The report, which never mentioned any allies in these global efforts, was
an embarrassment to Bush Sr. and his consensus-building advisers, and was
quickly suppressed after it was leaked to the New York Times. Then Bush was
defeated by Clinton, and the cell went underground in the boardrooms of
corporations and right-wing foundations and think tanks.
        In 1997, "appalled by the incoherent policies of the Clinton
administration," they formed a group called the Project for the New
American Century (PNAC), "to make the case and rally support for American
global leadership" and to restore "military strength and moral clarity."
Their founding statement was signed by, among others, Rumsfeld, Cheney,
Wolfkowitz, Khalilzad, Lewis Libby, and Jeb Bush (at the time the Heir
Apparent), along with such imams of conservatism as Francis Fukuyama,
William Bennett, and Norman Podhoretz.
        In September 2000-- when the election of Gore seemed a certainty-- PNAC
produced what was to become the Hammurabic Code of the Bush Jr.
Administration: _Rebuilding America's Defences: Strategies, Forces And
Resources For A New Century_. The document, which is endless, speaks openly
of a "Pax Americana": expanding current U.S. military bases abroad, and
building new ones in the Middle East, Southeast Europe, Latin America, and
Southeast Asia. It is contemptuous of the United Nations. It recommends
"pre-emptive strikes" and particularly mentions Iraq, Iran, and North
Korea. It suggests that to fight these countries we need small nuclear
warheads to target "very deep, underground bunkers." (Such weapons, called
Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrators, are now being developed.) It speaks of
fighting and "decisively winning simultaneous major theater wars." (Thus
Rumsfeld's current obsession with taking on Iraq and North Korea at the
same time.) It is the origin of that bizarre, Teutonic phrase, "homeland
security." It advocates, as has now been done, pulling out of the
Anti-Ballistic Missile and all other international defense treaties-- in
the Pax Americana we won't need them. It recommends increasing defense
spending to 3.8% of the Gross Domestic Product (the amount of the 2003
budget, almost to the penny). It talks not only of controlling outer space
with Star Wars weaponry, but also of controlling cyberspace, fighting
"enemies" (foreign or domestic?) on the Internet. One of its many charts
reads:

Competition


        The U.S., in short, is "the essential defender of today's global security
order." Allies are unnecessary; world opinion is irrelevant; potential
competitors must be crushed early. And, in the eeriest moment in the
report, it imagines "some catastrophic event," a "new Pearl Harbor," that
will be the catalyst for the U.S. to decisively launch its new Pax. (Small
wonder that, on September 12, 2001, Donald Rumsfeld insisted we immediately
invade Iraq and, shortly after, Condoleezza Rice convened senior members of
the National Security Council to ask them to "think about "How do you
capitalize on these opportunities?'" )
        The Sleeper Cell has awoken. After successfully engineering a judicial
coup d'etat to install their genial figurehead as President, they now
control the U.S. government. Led by Cheney and Rumsfeld, Wolfkowitz is
Deputy Defense Secretary, Khalilzad is Ambassador to Afghanistan, Libby is
Cheney's chief of staff, Abrams (after having been disgraced in the
Iran-contra scandal, and after years campaigning for a law to require the
posting of the Ten Commandments in every government building) is now chief
White House adviser on the Middle East. A half-dozen others from PNAC hold
important posts in the Defense and State departments. Their goal has been
cheerfully described by Condoleezza Rice (who believes that Bush is
"someone of tremendous intellect"): "American foreign policy in a
Republican administration should refocus the United States on the national
interest. There is nothing wrong with doing something that benefits all
humanity, but that is, in a sense, a second-order effect." Richard Perle,
chairman of the Defense Policy Board, is more honest: "This is total war. .
. If we just let our vision of the world go forth, and we embrace it
entirely and we don't try to piece together clever diplomacy, but just wage
a total war, our children will sing great songs about us years from now."


In ways that Ronald Reagan would envy, the Sleeper Cell is masterful at
manipulating the new forms of mass media, particularly the hyperbolic
television news and radio talk shows. It officially began the rhetorical
invasion of Iraq precisely on September 1 (in the words of Andrew Card,
White House chief of staff, "You don't launch a new product in August") and
was relentless in creating frightening stories until the November
elections. Endless reports of atrocities committed by Saddam Hussein (some
of them, of course, true) were combined with assertions that, as Rumsfeld
put it, there is "bulletproof evidence" linking Saddam and al-Qaeda (none
of which has ever been produced), which in turn were combined with frequent
warnings from Ashcroft and the FBI and the CIA of new "spectacular attacks"
from al-Qaeda "that meet several criteria: high symbolic value, mass
casualties, severe damage to the American economy and maximum psychological
trauma."
        It is dizzying trying to keep up with the news, to remember what happened
the day before-- which is precisely their intention--but let two examples
suffice: In December, a few days after Iraq turned over a 12,000-page list
of their weapons to the U.N.-- an act first demanded by the White House,
and then ridiculed when Iraq complied-- the media were suddenly flooded
with a story that Iraq had given al-Qaeda the nerve gas VX, an odorless,
colorless oil that causes death in minutes. This story, needless to say,
fit all the criteria for sensational news: Iraq/al-Qaeda connection,
gruesome death, and terrorist threat. A few days later, those omnipresent
and anonymous "senior officials" were telling CNN that there was
"absolutely no intelligence" on this matter, "zero confirmation of
evidence." Obviously the story had originally come from the government, and
it followed the classic pattern of what was, during the Vietnam War, called
"disinformation": leak false information, wait until it has its effect, and
then deny it, knowing that assertions remain in the collective memory
longer than their negations.
        Far more serious is the current frenzy over the possibility that Iraq will
somehow release smallpox, either among American troops in the projected
war, or in the U.S. itself through its imagined terrorist surrogates. This
has led to the mass-production of smallpox vaccines-- to the delight of the
drug company executives in the Bush inner circle-- ambitious plans to
vaccinate the entire country and the predictable "lifeboat" debates on
television of who should be vaccinated first.
        The smallpox panic largely comes from the assertions of Judith Miller, a
New York Times reporter, that unnamed "intelligence sources" are
"investigating" whether a scientist named Nelja Maltseva from the Russian
Institute of Viral Preparations visited Baghdad in 1990 and sold Iraq a
vial of a smallpox strain that caused an epidemic in Kazakhstan in 1972.
        Dr. Maltseva died two years ago. Both her daughter and a laboratory
assistant claim that she only visited Iraq once, in 1971, as part of a
global smallpox eradication effort, and that her last trip abroad was to
Finland in 1982. Furthermore, the Russians have always claimed that the
Kazakhstan epidemic never happened, but was merely Cold War propaganda.
        Edward Said attacked Miller years ago for her "thesis about the militant,
hateful quality of the Arab world." Among her many books, she is the
co-author of _Saddam Hussein and the Crisis in the Gulf_ with Laurie
Mylroie, who is the author of _Saddam Hussein's Unfinished War Against
America_, which expounds the theory that Saddam personally orchestrated the
1993 World Trade Center bombing-- a theory that only Richard Perle seems to
believe ("splendid and convincing"). Like almost everyone on the White
House Team, Miller is associated with two right-wing think tanks, the
American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research (the latest issue
of its magazine features Oriana Fallaci on the "moral superiority of
Western culture") and the Middle East Forum, which has been posting the
names of university professors critical of Bush on its website. The Forum
is run by Daniel Pipes, who is famous for his comment about the "massive
immigration of brown-skinned peoples cooking strange foods and not exactly
maintaining Germanic standards of hygiene".
        The general hysteria about smallpox, in other words, and the very real
possibility of mass vaccinations with its statistically inevitable
corresponding deaths, is entirely the result of unsubstantiated rumors
published by someone with a clear agenda.


Meanwhile, over at the Pentagon, Rumsfeld has created 2POG, the $7 billion
Proactive Pre-emptive Operations Group, whose "super-intelligence support
activity" will combine "CIA and military covert action, information
warfare, and deception." Along with the usual boys'-magazine fantasies of
high-tech espionage (including something about "tagging" the clothes of
terrorists with DNA samples that can be perceived by laser beams from
satellites) the "proactive" component consists of "duping al-Qaeda into
undertaking operations it is not prepared for and thereby exposing its
personnel." That is, encouraging terrorist acts that will provoke an
American response. If this seems unimaginable, or paranoid, it is worth
remembering Operation Northwoods, which the Pentagon proposed to Kennedy a
few months before he was assassinated. The idea then was a project of
bombings, hijackings and plane crashes that would kill American citizens
and lead to popular sentiment for an invasion of Cuba. (Kennedy-- even
James Bond-addicted Kennedy-- rejected that one.)
        Around another bend of the Pentagon, the Defense Research Projects Agency
has created the Information Awareness Office, whose mission is "Total
Information Awareness" (TIA). The Office is run by former Admiral John
Poindexter, who in 1990 was convicted of five felony counts for lying to
Congress about the Iran-contra affair. TIA, according to Poindexter, will
create "ultra-large-scale, semantically rich, easily implementable database
technologies" that will allow the Pentagon to access "world-wide,
distributed, legacy databases as if they were one centralized database."
Which means: every possible computerized record in the U.S., on which an
individual's name appears, will be copied and collated by the Pentagon:
credit card purchases, library books, police records, automatic
toll-collectors on bridges, university course enlistments, membership
lists, and on and on-- as well as all e-mails and logs of Internet surfing.
They have received $200 million for a pilot program. Over the door of
Poindexter's office is the motto "Scientia Est Potentia," Knowledge Is
Power. (George Bush presumably being the exception that proves the rule.)


The Sleeper Cell has awoken, and there is nothing to stop them. The
Democratic Party, afraid of being branded "unpatriotic" by the Republicans,
has gone into hibernation. The tattered remains of the Left is-- as the
Left always is-- more preoccupied with fighting among themselves. With a
few individual exceptions, there is almost no opposition in the major
media. (Powerful anti-Bush articles by, among others, Gore Vidal, Harold
Pinter, and John Berger, are published in England, but not here.) The only
forum for criticism is the Internet, which, though still uncontrolled,
remains the one point in the PNAC program that has yet to be (openly)
addressed by the Bush Team. As we enter Bush II Anno III, anger has turned
into a kind of sullen resignation.
        Perhaps the problem is that there are no words to describe this
Administration. All the pejoratives, however accurate, that might be
applied-- "warmongerers" and "imperialists," "corrupt" and "bloodthirsty,"
"fanatical" and "criminal"-- have been drained of their meaning by decades
of propaganda. They are as banal as the rhetoric of the think tanks. Small
wonder that American writers have generally been either silent or bathetic
("9/11 reminded me of the day my father died") on all that has happened in
the last two years. We no longer have the words to even think about what is
happening, about violence that is not "just like a movie," about people
like Cheney and Rumsfeld and Perle and Wolfkowitz and Rice and Ashcroft and
Bush, who are not Pol Pot or Stalin or Hitler, who are lesser forms of
evil, but evil nonetheless. To begin to talk about them is to relive the
old nightmare of the scream with no sound.

other well in Paris.

bedworthy kingdom


the main subject of this poem
is intelligence in art
or executive luncheons of machinic
ingenuity

i can't decide

do i focus on the new
"without genre"
ingenuities
and the works
accepted on the basis
of hacking and sharing files
and open source
and foster concepts
of transparency

OR

(feeling a bit like
a product at the moment)
do i opt for
cumguzzling
daily poetry blogs

OR

relaxing
first-person
perspectives
guaranteed to
misinform


OR

(as shakespeare points out)
the cinematic kinetic
communication means
between two worlds
as reflected in connections
between poets
on disability
(as opposed to intertwining
and entanglement)



what occurs to me now
is that shakespeare was a
map of virtual locations
incorporating
networked communication
and electronic civil
disobedience

he never used a slogan
like "please visit my audioblog"

he only reported the economic
benefits of the truth

shakespeare also liked shopping online
popup advertisements
and shopping cart ordering
(this is ubiquitous throughout
all his work)

meanwhile
he examined the possibilities
and perils
of a future dominated by
internet-based boys
plucking petals from online slams
in a nuclear mushroom cloud

not to mention
embedded electronic ID
tags in the cervixes
of child porn stars

i think i've made my point

Faulkner said this when he served as a scoutmaster for the Oxford Boy Scout
troop, but he was asked to resign for "moral reasons" (probably drinking).

Are any list members going to AWP in Baltimore?  Paul Hoover and I will be

I'm going too and I think am going to host one of the
"official" open mics so I hope a lot of people will
come and shake that one up a little--

though i think perhaps no on the onstage rat--

That was such a great reading in New Orleans.  It was fast and full and
packed, with about twenty readers.  Nevertheless, a stillness at the
heart of poetry must have been in evidence because otherwise the rat
would not have edged forward so nonchalantly into its customary ambit.
It was amazing to see it snuffling out and then the double-take:
"Uh--poetry.  Humans.  I'm out of here!"  Paul Hoover was reading at the
time; the rat proceeded out from an altar behind him.
It was sort of horrific.  And Paul Hoover, if you're there, you are
forever endearing for the modesty of your response.  As I remember it
anyway, for a second you took the audience's groan at the rat as a
reaction to your poetry.  I think Bill Lavender organized the reading:
it was a blast.  I'd love to read in Baltimore
with 20 other folks or failing that attend such a reading or failing
that host one in my bedroom.

The rat actually accompanied Donald Revell onstage.  Paul's response was
to a phone ringing in the audience and a woman shouting "Shut up." MC

You're right!  Ah, memory.  I had linked Donald Revell to the rat
alright but the image of Paul Hoover hovered more substantially.  Thank
you.

And I had to follow the rat!  And Revell!

It was a great reading, and we have the smart people
at Lit City to thank for it...I don't know of any
other similar reading at AWP yet, though I'm hoping
Verse Press is going to team up with some others and
put on some reading somewhere...

If anyone is motivated to do such a thing at this late
date, I'd be happy to help out, though I can't manage
it on my own.  I do know of a really cool book/zine
store called Atomic Books in a cool, nearby
neighborhood, and I had contacted them a long time ago
about being the venue to such a thing, and they were
open to it...

September 16 1971-January 15 2003

sometimes you get to wondering too late
just how it is you are born to a certain life
one day there you are you are there whereever it is, a
dirt floor, a hospital bed, in front of a television
to the tune of a brash jingle.  place x.  or maybe you wake up
decide to join a monastery and find a new family because you are
lonely. or maybe you just pick up a gun and put a hole
in the life that made you a whole, whatever that small
circle looked like, what it breathed, what it said, what it
bled.  that hole.  maybe you couldn't sleep for days, the medicare had
run out and there was no money left.  no money for the medication
that silenced the voices that monitored your secret
frequency, that frequented your secrecy.  so full of promise
10 years as a biologist, a zen buddhist for chrissakes all that meditation
and you couldn't sleep.  that would make you laugh if you heard me say it.
so when you moved home, 31, alone, a decade being a monk
on the west coast, and back home with a family as alien
as the last family, southern metropolis of 200,000 people who didn't
think the way you did, didn't hear the wondrous
sounds that made you buzz.  so when.  that hole.  it was red
for a moment and then you are sucked out clean through some
cosmic vacuum cleaner.  what happened in that burst of gunpowder
i wonder did that bullet vanish and with it all the world and the
silence of the sleepless horror the mad pacing the the the the the
where did it I just you shouldn't have how could you so
full of promise this is the third one so many dead friends you fucker
why did you leave the mess was it quiet we had such times
together you shot me goddamn it we're too young a zero to your skull
machines of the flesh are eating us like stale bread don't let it
a necklace of quartered hands and feet on hooks delivered
in the form of an unexpected phone call zero zero open hole
even dolphy was 37 and at least he got the chance to sing so
did you wake up in that life I am so sorry i understand now and then
you wake up in that life and then you go finally go to sleep.

Hi everyone!  And please excuse the cross-posting.  The Book of Hope and the
World Healing Anthology will soon be distributed in the U.S. via Baker and
Taylor.  These two anthologies were published in the wake of 9/11 and contain
poetry and art by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, John Kinsella, Rita Dove, the Dali
Lama, our own Lewis LaCook--oh yes, and moi.  Plus a cast of, well, a big
cast.  Look for it, please.  Some of the proceeds (maybe all--I forget) are
dedicated to aiding children in Afghanistan.  Best, Bill

Maxine Chernoff asks:

Are any list members going to AWP in Baltimore?  Paul Hoover and I
will be there and are wondering if there'll be a similar reading as
the one in New Orleans at the wonderful church with many readers and
an onstage rat.

I Reply:

I second this question!
I'm going, and who else will be around?
I would love to have such an event to go to. I missed last year's.

Best,
  JG

Jerome Rothenberg has been sending around this blog.  it's pretty interesting, especially the "13.01.03" entry titled A SKETCH ON GLOBALIZATION & ETHNOPOETICS

i know there's a lot of blogs out there, but here's one you that's really great that you may not have found yet.

here's the way in
http://www.thetijuanabibleofpoetics.blogspot.com

but i must say i take issue with the top of his "15.01.03" entry where he states "If blogs turn into a scene it would be an unfortunate situation.  I think that American poetry is too scene-driven."

the first of the two sentences is where i'm particularly annoyed.  i mean, WHY should Heriberto Yepez get to have a blog and no one else?  not that he's saying that EXACTLY of course, but it IS a statement that suggests an elitist world view.  one where whatever "i'm doing is special, because i'm special, and god forbid everyone should want to get in on it and then i'll have to find something else to do that's even more special than the last special thing that made me special until they take that over too and then i'll just have to..." the cycle consumes!

recently a poet i know (he's too timid for me to mention his name and he'd throttle me if he found out i did, so i won't) said to me, "GOSH, there's so many poets in the world, why do i bother writing poetry at all!?"

that really pissed me off!

depending on how long this planet keeps allowing us to exist on it, there will most likely always be poets, and yes, the poetry will keep growing and growing and an endless amount of it will exist one day and no poet will be able to read it all in one lifetime and we'll have to place a book-marker in a book and die and come back in another life and learn how to read all over again and pick up the book where we left off and so on and so on.  it already seems that way and i happen to LOVE the fact that it's all there and all still coming and growing.  there are so many poets to investigate!  i would be SO PISSED OFF if someone transported me back into time where i couldn't pick up one of a million book of poems of our time!

later Heriberto goes on in the "15.01.03" entry to explain what he feels a blog's entry should consist, and that's fine.  i kind of like hearing what he's feeling about format.  but as far as the specialty of it, hoping it doesn't become a "scene," eh, no thanks, i say LET IT HAPPEN!  let everyone write poems, blogs, novels (i HATE novels, but it's none of my business if people want to waste their time reading and writing them), creating anyway they can everywhere they can.  the best possible CHANGE is only possible when every mind on the planet has fixed its own view of the world.  creativity is the way OUT of domination and policing of thoughts and passions!

what does it mean that there are THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS of students RIGHT NOW getting degrees in art and poetry?  there's no way they're all going to FIT and SQUEEZE into the narrow market for what the world of "art" as commodity has become.  maybe this is the beginning of a new wave, a whole planet sharing the idea of getting into the mix of what really DRIVES the spirit into action!  maybe all these students pouring off the graduation stage with diplomas in hand will help build a new frame, one that has room for everyone, finally.

this may sound like i don't appreciate Heriberto's blog.  no way, it's wonderfully written from entry to entry.  i love the way his mind shifts around.  he's a brilliant view of the world to share.  but i would hate to agree with everything some "one" says.

Heriberto read (with two other poets) last night in LA and does so again I
think next week. Noteworthy is that last night's reading, announced here,
was attended by not one single list member, altho there was a sizeable
entirely-latino crowd.

He'll be reading in NY in the last week in February. I'll make sure to post
dates and venues for this and next week's LA outing.

Some of his poems (Spanish, with English translation) are included in the
anthologies Reversible Monuments (Coach House 2002, translations by Monica
de la Torre, Harry Polkinhorn and yours truly) and Across the Line / Al
otro lado: The Poetry of Baja California (Junction Press 2002, translations
by Harry and me).

Subject:      IS EXPERIMENTALISM DWINDLING?  {what's ~your~ opinion?  VOTE now!}
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

. . . I've wondered: it's becoming cliché to say that
there seem to be so many ("too many," some say)
experimentalists around these days (or "so much"
poetry), etc.,--- but I've been wondering if,
proportionately, given the exponential scale of
overpopulation, the ratio of experimentalists to total
population might actually be ~smaller~ than in the
past.

The actual intuition behind the "so many"/"too many"
refrain might be that, in fact, we can ~feel~ that
something's wrong and that there just aren't *enough*
of us, in comparison to even the most infinitesimal,
comparable cultural phenomenon.

(---But what ~is~ a comparable cultural phenomenon on
such a ghettoized scale?  Ballet?)

(Is it my imagination, or are there fewer calls for
submissions from print journals than there were a year
ago?   In such a small "market," when a journal that
has succeeded in establishing a presence, as ~Outlet~
or ~Kenning~ did, goes out of business and closes down
shop ~without passing the masthead on to successors~
the way institutional journals have a series of
editors, it has a very significant effect, in terms of
market theory.  ---Or, for every ~Outlet~ and
~Kenning,~ am I wrong and is there a ~Conundrum~ or
~Pom2~ that springs up to take its hydra-headed
place?)


That recognition, that insight, that a big fish in a
small pond isn't the same size once it's out in the
ocean, through some sort of defense mechanism of
compounded ~denial~ and reverse psychology, comes out
stated as its opposite, . . . the way that
claustrophobia and agoraphobia feel basically the same
and could be mistaken for each other.


There are, after all, a ~tremendous~ number of people
around now, and Americans.  Is the population of the
United States still estimated to be around
250,000,000?  Would it be conservative or too generous
to approximate that there might be, say, 10,000
"practicing" experimental poets in America?

(Of course, any such guess becomes skewed by how
transitory a breed experimental poets are and how much
~attrition~ there is, on a constant basis, given
largely to its being a passion of ~youth~ with a
staggering drop-out rate ["Forever panting, and
forever young" --- Ode on a Grecian Urn].  [In belated
response to a previous Poetics List question about
agism,--- the inhospitable environment and
against-the-grain wear-&-tear, life's changing
circumstances, re-route most poets by their second
decade in the trenches,--- so that the mere
~existence~ of a poet who's still writing in her/his
seventies or sixties or fifties is applauded as
sheerly remarkable for its weather-beaten survival,
like hearing about a 20-year old house cat, despite
whether it stands in its water bowl while it laps.]
In your twenties, you write poetry; in your thirties,
you blog.)

10,000 experimentalist poets would be

               0.00004%

of the general populaton.  --- Does it help to be
overly optimistic and think that there are 100,000
American experimentalist poets?  That would inflate
the ratio to only 0.0004% (four one-hundredths of one
percent ---if I can still remember how to count).


This might matter, too, inasmuch as producers and
consumers tend to be one within the poetry world, the
notorious phenomenon of everyone in the audience at a
poetry reading themselves being poets.  ---  Does "so
many"/"too many" poets mean "I am uncomfortable paying
$12.00 per book"?   (Is your poetry collection as
large as your CD collection?)

Under the turn-of-the-(1800s>1900s)-century conditions
under which an archetypal bourgeois avant-garde arose,
yes, there was a smaller pool of literate population,
but such a smaller circle existed within a vastly
smaller general population where 10 poets counted for
much, much more in terms of their general influence.
The influence of the bourgeoisie that spawned such
poets had a very strong dominance over the masses, too
(an imbalance that has since, culturally, reversed
itself).  The "movement" may actually be dwindling.
Tremendously.  . . . Except that it's all warped
out-of-scale by the enormous exponentials of
overpopulation.

"I Have Been Living"

I have been living
closer to the ocean than I thought--
in a rocky cove thick with seaweed.

It pulls me down when I go wading.
Sometimes, to get back to land
takes everything that I have in me.

Sometimes, to get back to land
is the worst thing a person can do.
Meanwhile, we are dreaming:

The body is innocent.
She has never hurt me.
What we love flutters in us.

If anyone still needs convincing that all notions of mainstream and margin,
avant and derriere, have been rendered ~meaningless~ by the
academic-professional domination of poetry, then a quick trip to the AWP's
website might be indicated.

http://www.awpwriter.org/aboutawp/index.htm

One thing I, personally, hate about the AWP and MFA programs in general is
that they make the art of poetry seem so deeply uncool.  They make poets
seem about as cool as high school music teachers or maybe librarians.
Middle school librarians meet at conferences in Baltimore.  But poets?

Writing programs simply take advantage of the self-deluded, who have no
other image of the poet than as an academic.  Consider this bit of
institutional self-promotion: "Some of the most important writers of this
century have attended university writing programs and worked as professors
of writing and literature."  What is falsely implied here is that these
"most important writers" could not have developed ~without~ a writing
program, which is obviously bullshit.  The question isn't whether good
writers ever teach (of course they do--it's better than working at
Safeway).  The question is why anyone would think that, given the reality
of massively unequal distribution of talent, it makes sense to attend
school to become an artist.  There are, by the AWP's count, currently 99
MFA-granting programs.  I doubt I could name 50 living poets -- yet there
are twice that many ~programs~?

Have I made my skepticism sufficiently clear?  Look at what else they say
on the AWP site: "More than any other literary arts organization, AWP has
advanced the appreciation of literature as an open and living art--growing
and evolving--an art that can be enjoyed by anyone who can read, an art
that can be made by anyone with talent who is willing and disciplined
enough to devote one's self to its difficult demands."  What subterfuge!
If you have "talent" and are "disciplined," then what do you need the U of
Iowa for?  A lawyer couldn't have formulated this claim more cunningly.

Has any new work been done on Helen Adam?  It would be wonderful to have a
biography of this fine poet.  When I met her back in 1982 she was the
embodiment of the dark Muse, swinging her fists and belting out her
supernatural ballads.  I see on Amazon that her ballads are o.p.  News would
be appreciated.  Jess

Hi Maria,

You mention the dishonesty of the Women of the Beat Generation. I was never

Hi Andrew,

This is a wonderful message and thanks for posting it. I am trapped in this
train of thought too. I am recently graduated and have just found employment
again as an arts accountant / grant writer. I have been plaguing myself with
questions of 'go to grad school and become a real poet'. But I am not sure I
want to be a scholar ( as the rules are very different) but to be a poet. I
think that a mentorship would be great but what does one do? Any ideas for
the flighty?

Best, Geoffrey

i've been thinking; those of us not in NYC could consider starting up
local chapters of Poetry is News! wherever we are.  then in addition
to organizing local events, we can perhaps coordinate collaborative
activities x-country, etc.  letter/poetry writing campaigns, etc.

Andrew,

Jeffrey Jullich estimates, maybe sarcastically, there may be 10,000 living
experimental poets and that experimentalism is dwinding because the numbers
are growing. And you claim uncoolness is growing because, though you can't
name 50 living poets, there are a hundred MFA programs in the nation. I
have to wonder about the big concern about numbers.

1. Is your concern over numbers in any way related to the scarcity model of
"talent" or, seeing as how you put the word, rightfully, in scare marks,
how can there be this much good stuff or useful stuff or readable stuff? or
is it akin to Marjorie Perloff's strangely reactionary cri du coeur 4 years
ago when she called for more "intolerance" in American experimental poetry.
That strong sense always that we ought to whittle down the idea of what's
good, what's cool, what's acceptable...hey, this is starting to sound alike
an incipient impulse behind canon construction: less is more, true coolness
and experiment is scarce, hipness is aristocratic not democratic. Is "cool"
here accruing the same coding as "talent" if looked at in light of the
scarcity model? We are living through a post-avant renaissance, or just a
straight-up renaissance, gotta figure out some way to group and sort and
judge...

2. Too I wonder if part of what's behind your comparison of AWP writers to
middle school librarians is simply that old "hip" romantic model: the
writer as lone drunken wolf -- Kerouac, Byron -- or lone visionary "Indian"
of letters -- Ginsberg, Blake (or Robert Bly in his 1960s warrior poet
battle garb taking on the cranks, the academics, the Saxons).

3. As someone affiliated with two writing programs as a student, who's
started two writing programs in prisons and taught in three university
writing programs after grad school, I can tell you that few students join
wriitng programs holding the "academic=poet" model (Bly made that an unhip
thing to think way back in 1968). They're usually very smart geeks -- and
if they fell on one side of a line separating teh academic model from teh
romantic, they'd fall on the romantic end. Poet=Rebel.

4. What's more, Poet=Rebel is/was a big part of the Academic model of the
poet anyway -- Golding noting it is academe itself (that most unhip of
insitutions as you rightfully note [would you prefer MTV?]) that takes in
the hip outlaw. And most poets now affiliated with former Objectivist 'n'
Black Mtn poets (ie SUNY Buffalo or Penn), langpo and postlangpo -- William
Bronk's  leather-jacket cover photo SAGETRIEB issue which was, if memory
serves entitled _Answerable to No One_ or Gilmore's _Don't Touch the Poet:
The Life and Times of Joel Oppenheimer_ or Chs Bernstein's _My Way_ -- the
canon-making of the white middle or artisan class male relies heavily on
poet=rebel, poet=marginal, poet=scarce.

5. It is the very impulse toward coolness, toward banding about the
exclusive rebel king (it's mostly a male thing), that feeds the academe
youre talking about.

6. However one of the cooolest things about AWP for me is that it is and

For that matter, Andrew, what's so "uncool" about high school music teachers
and middle school librarians per se?  Thank goodness we still have them ...
so far.

I think there are lots of valid reasons to be dissatisfied with many
mainstream writing programs, chief among them the stultifying
commodification and homogeneity that they instill in poetic culture.
Notions of "coolness" vs. "uncoolness" however, are going to get us in
trouble, as Gabe has rightly pointed out.  "Coolness," like "irony" and
"postmodernism" is one of the major commodities advertised by much slick
contemporary "literary" writing of the kind produced by MFA programs.  It
may be a different concept of "cool" from that imagined by "experimental"
writers, but the minute you begin to hold "cool" up as a serious aesthetic
ideal, you are moving toward that bankrupt commercial expanse.
"Experimental" writing itself, or the notion of its surface at least, has
become one more "cool" texture to add to the mainstream MFA repertoire.

Academia (by which I understand the institutional disciplines of criticism
and literary history, as opposed to the vocational-crafts emphasis of MFA
programs, though of course they often overlap) is not the problem.  The
problem is the degradation of the literary marketplace by bloated monolithic
corporatism.  Academia, in fact, is one of the few things keeping some MFA
programs worthwhile: when rigorous criticism, theory, and literary history
are practiced alongside workshop activity, there is at least the potential
for substantive engagement with writing as a meaningful social and cultural
activity, rather than a banal means to profit and ego-gratification.

I'm not saying that academia always delivers on this potential, but it's a
mistake to make academia synonymous with professional writing programs just
because they often share buildings and personnel.

While I'm looking forward to reading Alissa Quart's forthcoming study of
marketing and teenagers, I have to think Tom Frank's sociology of cool is
actually part of a neoconservative conspiracy to introduce good
old-fashioned lefty smart-ass one-upping to a new generation that hasn't
been divided and conquered into complete apathy and need for garage-door
openers yet. I disliked my high school music teacher intensely (starting
when she told me in show choir that if I stood with my hands behind my
back like that I wudn't evva gonna get laid -- an indirect invitation to
her place I'm pretty sure others took up, yikes), but a few years later we
all got Kurt Cobain's substitution-matrix version of better-dead-than-red,
"rather be dead than cool," and everybody knows how that turned out. What
am I saying. I'm saying watch the one-upping, and set limits on anybody
who tries generational divide-and-conquer tricks, especially bloggers.
Any dorm bull session is going to be more educational.

Gabe, the photo you're thinking of is of Edward Foster, & it's on the cover
of his book _Answerable to None_, which does, by the way, discuss Bronk.
You forgot to mention the motorcycle he's standing next to.  Yeah,
Poet=Rebel, & yes, that stance toward rebellion is a guy thing.  However as
a poet who holds an MFA & who doesn't teach, I can sympathize a little bit
with Andy's skepticism, if only because of the supposition that if you're a
poet that's of course what you do.  That's not to say there's anything wrong
with poets teaching, or with aspiring writers going to school.  MFA programs
may market themselves as "producing" important writers, but as you suggest I
don't think anyone but the terribly naive believes that hype.

Don't forget the cover to Michael McClure's _Star_ (Grove), on the
motorbike w/ the hair falling across his face. I don't think McClure's gay
(half that book's about titties), but I'd fuck him. Thrillingly LRSN

Andrew Rathmann writes to say he doesn't like what AWP and MFAs
smell like:

<One thing I, personally, hate about the AWP and MFA programs in

They make poets seem about as cool as high school music teachers or

Baltimore.  But poets?>

I Reply:

Mostly people I've talked with say they go to the AWP conferences to
see friends. Maybe buy a couple/few books. Catch a reading. Have a
drink and meet some people. It's very convenient in that way.

As for all that other stuff, yeah, one has to take the advertising claims
of any organization, well, as advertising. I'm not a fan of it either.
BTW, if you found it fun reading the website, you should subscribe to
the AWP Chronicle . . . it even has photos.

As for graduate programs . . . well, they do allow a person to spend a
few years face to face with some writers talking about writing. I had a
good time. (And not everyone is pretentious about it . . .)

Guys,

I’d like to bring a couple of different perspectives to the discussion
about MFA programs and poetry.  Firstly, I came to the United States in
1994 in order to do a Master’s in poetry.  I came, with a 7 year old
child, from Ireland, where there were no MFA programs at that time, and
where there was intense skepticism about teaching anyone to write.  This
intense skepticism was significantly played out in pubs, which had been,
for some decades, the “hedge schools” of poetry.  I got my pub credits
too, in my twenties, along with writing a few books and plays, and a lot
of journalism.   I had no training for any of this, but I had a lot of
opportunity.  The day after my thirtieth birthday, my first child was
born.  The pub gradually became a less viable forum of exchange.  Yet
the image of the Irish poet was, to some extent, still identified with
the pub.  Jobs I worked at in the next few years included art gallery
manager, arts center director, hospital domestic, and substitute
teacher.  A low point was peddling furiously on my bike up and down
hills in Dun Laoghaire in Dublin, where it rains constantly, leaving my
daughter, then 4, to a babysitter, who would in turn leave her to
school, peddling to the hospital where I worked, always late, working my
shift, peddling to collect my daughter from school and leave her back to
the babysitter, doing the second shift at the hospital, then peddling
back up to the babysitter to collect Marina, etc etc.  This was
definitely not the image of the Irish poet, though I had by then
published about 40 poems.  I finally went back to college to get a
teaching certification.   My intention was to become a high school
teacher (I was definitely uncool).  I got a job but at the same time was
accepted into a creative writing program in the United States.  I took
that opportunity because it offered time to read and write, the chance
to talk about writing outside the pub, the opportunity to teach, and a
minimum income on which myself and my daughter could survive.  When I
was doing that degree, classes were my social life.  I lapped it up.  I
knew I was enjoying something that was not available in Ireland.  I also
knew, after the harrowing year I had spent getting teacher
certification, that I would not be able to pursue any more advanced
degrees in Ireland.  Here I was able to do an M.A., and a Ph.D., and I
am grateful.

The second perspective I’d like to offer is that of someone who teaches
at an art school. In Ireland, my compadres were visual artists.  Studios
were fantastic places for me: of books and images and ideas and smells.
Some of my friends hadn’t completed secondary school.  But all of them
had gone to art school, generally with huge appetite.  I agree with
Finnegan.  Artists relish training.  Historically, in poetry, this is
also the case, though not, in Ireland, for most of the twentieth
century.  Maybe my students should get the hell out of art school and
get a job unconnected to their field.  But it seems absurd.

On Henry’s point — and something I was unaware of when I immigrated —
there is a wide range of MFA programs in creative writing, some of which
integrate creative writing “with professional & general education,” as
he recommends.   I’m thinking of the MFA at the School of the Art
Institute of Chicago, because it interests me; the AWP guide to writing
programs is a useful resource.

I have already admitted to being uncool, now I’ll admit to being excited
about going to Baltimore, the city where Frederick Douglass learned to
read.  My associations with Baltimore are Frederick Douglass, Poe, and
Randy Newman.  But then, as an immigrant, I also find the concepts of
“middle school librarian” and “high school music teacher” exciting.

Mairead

Hi, all--

I'm looking into a possible venue for a last-minute
alternative reading.  I contacted Atomic Books but
they can't fit that many people in the space (really
only 25 or so), so that didn't seem to work.  I have
an email into a cool-sounding collective that hosts
experimental film and performance stuff at a
collective-run bookstore, so I'll let you  know if I
hear back.

I am just back from almost a full day of walk and protest here in San
Francisco from the Embarcadero waterfront up to the Civic Center. Crowd
estimates vary from 100 to more than 200,000 people. Astonishingly beautiful
sunny weather and warm except a little chill walking in the shadows between
buildings. I don't think I have ever seen such a wide array of people in one
place at one time - grandparents to babies, regional, suburban, City, ages,
multiple genders, colors. The white middle class has finally joined up big
time.  Everyone sweetly upbeat and, I suspect, simultaneously terrified of
the consequences of the prospect of this war.
Different then already clearly defined battles - in which the protest
language is often systematically set and printed up on banners (of which
there was some), what was interesting to me were the placards - most of
which were homemade and of which the phrases seemed home made as well -
bringing up an array of phrases, awkward some, but most often honest
attempts to get at some way to forge a stance, if not direction or fixed
resolution. A public, grass roots opposition trying hard to come up with an
effective language in the absence of any institutionalized leadership (i.e.
the democratic party) that is making even a peep.  (Curious I find it how
the media keeps trying to locate this new opposition with "Christian
churches" - of which there are no doubt some - but not a readily
identifiable presence in today's walk or its organization/ and a kind of
insult to the diversity and majority of the participants.)
I spent a bunch of time writing down what I read on the placards. I share
them because I don't think much of this made it on to the TV or Radio.  I
suspect the phrases provide a pretty good notion of what's bouncing off the
western psychic transom - at least that's I took and felt them:

Mairead,

I'm glad you entered into this discussion. And put a more balanced spin on
it. It is a gross generalization to assume that all MFA programs are the
same, this is decidedly not the case. And someone (G. Gatza?) recently put
forth a query to the effect of whether or not to return to school, to which
I would add, 'well, what would you like to think about? would you like to
occupy your mind with balancing accounts for an arts organization whose
ethics and largesse you may or may not agree with? or, devote your mind to
the study of poetics?' Because the fact remains that we live in a
post-Dickensian era and there is no debtors prison. I take great faith in
this aspect of American life. Rack up the debt, do what you want to do and
inculcate your mind with the thoughts that you'd like to be thinking.

People choose MFA programs for many different reasons, and many MFA's
incorporate critical writing and progressive, independent, project-based
work. Perhaps what people are really complaining about is the trouble of
workshop based MFA's which tend to produce homogenized work or work that
excels at the art of imitation rather than original (and critical) thinking,
writing and reading skills. But then, there I go, generalizing. And, of
course, not all students approach programs the same way. But couldn't this
also be accurately said about PhD programs? This leads to larger issues of
employment, population: a sea of people with more degrees than jobs; if you
really want to get bummed out, visit the MLA's website for thoroughly
researched statistics on the state of affairs for employment in the academy.
Grim barely comes close to describing it.

There has almost always been a need for education reform, perhaps never more
immediately than now. In case anyone has trod the halls of our public
schools lately, there is a tremendous amount of work to be done. And, as the
MLA's own reports advise, this is true for the academy as well. It's
ignorant and offensive to assume that MFA students are naive. There is a nee
d for looking more closely at how creative writing programs are structured
and what they actually prepare their students for. But couldn't this also be
said for PhD programs? How well is the academy preparing it's PhD students
for the grim specter of procuring actual employment in the academy once they
leave?

I certainly don' t have any answers to these issues/questions, but I grow
weary of the anti-MFA tone of certain posts frequently found on this list
(uh, how many of us have them or are currently working on them?) and
generalization, in this instance, merely draws lines between us, as poets,
where what we really need is to be supportive of eachother and curious about
the work that other people are doing. Regardless of their pedigree. Or lack
thereof.

Subject:      The Pump-Organ
MIME-Version: 1.0

The Pump-Organ

i. Here we are again, almost no filtering, no programs, no Nikuko or
Jennifer, nothing but a text, inscribed through keystroke after keystroke.
The exhausting labor, the tending of the writing, bringing point after
point as a gift to your attention.
ii. Such a triviality! To write about a pump-organ, reed-organ, in the
early days of war and total violence - not making a point about the
generosity of peace, in fact making no point at all in relation to the
presumed primordial and natural, prelapsarian, state of the world at all.
iii. The organ was made by Daniel F. Beatty company between 1878-1880;
it's made from quarter-sawn oak, ebony, a celluloid/chalk composition for
the keys, rubberized cloth for the bellows.
iv. Repairs including patching the cloth with rubberized tape and glue,
pulling and cleaning the C and two other reeds, taping the pedal bellows,
and cleaning the instrument in general.
v. The pitch is high-pitch, which was popular only for a few years in the
19th-century, around the period the organ was produced. The keyboard is
divided into three sections with fourteen stops, including treble and bass
couplers. The sections are more or less independent unless coupled. The
full range is probably seven octaves over 61 keys. A higher-range key
sounds for five to ten seconds after pedaling stops. A lower-range key
holds for four to five sections.
vi. Played, the instrument breathes like a huge lung; pedal-speed is
coupled with a slight swelling volume - and, more important, with the
movement of the pedaling body; the result often coincides with the rhythm
of the improvisation.
vii. The player's breathing, the movement of the body, the air pressure
within the instrument, all contribute to an overall singing, unlike the
banging of a piano or rasping of a guitar. The organ must be tended at all
times; pressing a key slightly, for example, will foil the coupling and
create different onset characteristics. Likewise, pedal speed and depth
contribute to the possibility of a volume-envelope reflecting the thought
behind the music - the body of the player, body of the music, coupled with
the instrument of oak, rubber, glue, metal, and proto-plastics.
viii. Unlike a harmonium, the sound-box contains a vacuum; the note is
pulled out of the atmosphere. This pulling-forth brings the note, through
the vibration of the sound-box, into the air. Since it is a suction
instrument, there is a ceiling to the volume, characterized by the four-
teen-some pounds of atmospheric air-pressure.
ix. Harmonies on the instrument are transparent; instead of isolated pipes
or strings, all sounding occurs by virtue of the sound-box. The player can
feel the vibrations of the instrument case, the keyboard, the pedals;
everything moves together, as in a tamboura. The sounding emanates from a
distributed large volume; the room itself seems to speak.
x. I improvise moving from figure to figure, bringing the figures and
widely varying keys into harmony and transformation with one another. The
improvisations last from seventeen to thirty minutes. The left-hand
creates slow bass counterpoint or parallel fourths, fifths, and octave;
the right-hand works through Chinese, Arabic, and Indian scales. The
recording is made on a Sony mini-disk walkman, then uploaded to Soundforge
for multi-tap and/or reverberation treatment. The pieces are placed on
music cds.
xi. But what I enjoy, notice, most of all, is the breathing of the organ,
our mutual labor, and the production of a sound concomitant with inhaling
and absorbing the world around us. Together we are speaking, and for a
moment our widely disparate histories coincide to bring about primordial
eras of worlds, from this one to the next.

Thanks, Jane, for your very clear and forthright post.

Two years ago, when I was researching MFA programs in order to evaluate
the design of the new MFA program at the University of Mississippi,
where I was then teaching, I was keenly aware of how individual
departments and institutions shaped their programs according to their
own economies and ideologies.
The job market, weak though it may currently be, is also a great
instructor in respect to the intense care, or lack of it, with which
individual departments shape creative writing programs, both at the
undergraduate and graduate level.

On a more micro level, I am trying to design a non workshop based poetry
writing seminar and would welcome any structural or strategic ideas from
people who have practiced something like this.

I liked Geoffrey's idea of "mentorship." Are there current examples of
this working outside the academy?

I have mixed feelings about debt.  Sometimes I think debt has the effect
of binding graduates to conservative choices.  Bleakly, I sometimes
think that the academy is an enclave which controls the exuberance of
young people by hierarchization and atomization; when they graduate,
debt occupies them until they have children, and beyond.  If they stay
in the academy, the tenure-track process, or lack of it, takes over:
it's (clean) nose to the grindstone for 6 or 7 years (while also
repaying those loans).  And by the time one gains tenure, if one ever
does, and freedom of speech without losing one's job, one may be too
exhausted or comfortable to exercise it.

That's the bleak view, formed from my realization some years ago that
Liberal Arts, as I knew them, weren't that liberal.  And that's just
setting a challenge to myself.

Thank you,

Mairead

Mairead,

I'm glad you entered into this discussion. And put a more balanced spin
on
it. It is a gross generalization to assume that all MFA programs are the
same, this is decidedly not the case. And someone (G. Gatza?) recently
put
forth a query to the effect of whether or not to return to school, to
which
I would add, 'well, what would you like to think about? would you like
to
occupy your mind with balancing accounts for an arts organization whose
ethics and largesse you may or may not agree with? or, devote your mind
to
the study of poetics?' Because the fact remains that we live in a
post-Dickensian era and there is no debtors prison. I take great faith
in
this aspect of American life. Rack up the debt, do what you want to do
and
inculcate your mind with the thoughts that you'd like to be thinking.

People choose MFA programs for many different reasons, and many MFA's
incorporate critical writing and progressive, independent, project-based
work. Perhaps what people are really complaining about is the trouble of
workshop based MFA's which tend to produce homogenized work or work that
excels at the art of imitation rather than original (and critical)
thinking,
writing and reading skills. But then, there I go, generalizing. And, of
course, not all students approach programs the same way. But couldn't
this
also be accurately said about PhD programs? This leads to larger issues
of
employment, population: a sea of people with more degrees than jobs; if
you
really want to get bummed out, visit the MLA's website for thoroughly
researched statistics on the state of affairs for employment in the
academy.
Grim barely comes close to describing it.

There has almost always been a need for education reform, perhaps never
more
immediately than now. In case anyone has trod the halls of our public
schools lately, there is a tremendous amount of work to be done. And, as
the
MLA's own reports advise, this is true for the academy as well. It's
ignorant and offensive to assume that MFA students are naive. There is a
nee
d for looking more closely at how creative writing programs are
structured
and what they actually prepare their students for. But couldn't this
also be
said for PhD programs? How well is the academy preparing it's PhD
students
for the grim specter of procuring actual employment in the academy once
they
leave?

I certainly don' t have any answers to these issues/questions, but I
grow
weary of the anti-MFA tone of certain posts frequently found on this
list
(uh, how many of us have them or are currently working on them?) and
generalization, in this instance, merely draws lines between us, as
poets,
where what we really need is to be supportive of eachother and curious
about
the work that other people are doing. Regardless of their pedigree. Or
lack
thereof.

Leftist Caught Red-Handed in Bad Pun


        Sarah Williamson was arrested last night for spamming a number of
email lists with a 'bad pun,' Yorkshire Heights police reported last
night.  'The complaints were overwhelming,' John Stockton, chief, said.
'We had to do something.'

        The pun went as follows: "'It takes a village to raise a child.'
- Hillary Clinton. 'It takes an idiot to raze a village.' - George Bush."

here's an australian spin on mairead's post.

i feel this list is very america-centric in its thinking, perhaps not=20
intentially, but one gets the feeling that the list in general equates=20
poetry with poetry that happens in the usa. but poetry does happen in other=
=20
places in the world, and even if we are far away and small in population i=
=20
assure you that there is a poetic culture in australia and issues that are=
=20
similar to the american experience.

as a professional performance poet for ten years, and as a person with a=20
science education, and as a person who did not study literature from books=
=20
at university, but rather developed my aesthetic in the pubs and coffee=20
lounges of melbourne and sydney, i would like to comment on the community=20
or local poetry as compared/intertwingled with the academic treatment of=20
poetry.

before contact with the melbourne performance poetry scene i thought i was=
=20
the only person in the world expressing themselves through poetry, my work=
=20
resembled song lyric, in metre and rhyme because that was my concept of=20
poetry from school, but also because people like bob dylan were my idea of=
=20
modern poets. the poetry readings introduced me to index poetry, to=20
humorous poetry, to political poetry, to non-rhyming poetry, to personal=20
poetry, to conversational poetry, to sound poetry, to shouting poetry to=20
whispering poetry. i was learning the theory through practice, the=20
sounding, the local activity also being a sharing, so the influences of the=
=20
surrealists, the dadaists, the beats, the black mountain poets, the new=20
york school poets, the lang-pos were brought to soundings by the various=20
poets in their poems and i incorporated in my own writing without=20
consciously studying them. the territory the poetry mapped was also=20
expanded as i left my self as object and subject of my poetry and looked=20
further afield.


i appreciate the importance of the local activity of poetry, the poetry=20
sounding(reading). this aspect of poetic culture has been trivialised or=20
marginalised over the last 50 years; for political reasons during the 50s,=
=20
60s and 70s (mccarthy anti-communist period, cold war, and vietnam where=20
poetry readings were seen as subversive left-wing activities);=20
for  cultural elitist reasons (seen as 'low' or 'popular' culture); or for=
=20
commercial reasons (published books being more traditionally marketable=20
items). this was at the same time that english publishers were opening=20
australian divisions and publishing australian poetry lists and the time=20
that australian literature was being introduced into the university=20
curriculum, the establishment of the university presses, and a fairly=20
conservative establishment of academics and book publishers were developing=
=20
a canon which rooted the australian tradition back to england via oxford=20
university and shakespeare, and far from the bush ballad and=20
'australianist' poetry of the first half of the 19th century in australia.=
=20
this establishment resisted the influences of theory and praxis outside of=
=20
england. it wasn't until the 70s and 80s did we start to see the influence=
=20
of american new criticism and influences of movements like the beats, the=20
projectivists, the new york school and the L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE=
 poets, and the=20
influence of french theorists on the poetic discourse of australia. in the=
=20
70s poetry readings became very important to the culture, an important part=
=20
of anti-vietnam , feminist, lifestyle experimentation, gays and lesbians,=20
idigenous and ethnic group activities. they were also focal points for=20
publishing ventures and the emergence in the late 70s and early 80s of the=
=20
small independent presses(sometimes called the mimeograph publishers=20
because they were cheaply printed and hand collated and bound).  the=20
anglo-centric view of australian culture and literary canon was being=20
challenged at the community level and at the academic level with younger,=20
better informed, culturally representative academics keen to establish=20
australian poetry amongst the english-language poetries of the world and=20
with a more pluralistic view of the poetics and aesthetics of poetry and in=
=20
deed writing in general.

unlike the usa, which has had creative writing programs at universities=20
(since 1922 i believe, iowa?) the conservative au universities resisted=20
creative writing programs in the 70s, but they were introduced through=20
community pressure, into colleges of advanced education (teacher training)=
=20
and tertiary institutes of technology. strangely enough the=20
autobiographical or workshop nature of the usa writing programs was often=20
cited as a reason not to introduce writing programs into universities. many=

writers who didn't have university educations in literature or writing=20
found teaching these courses to be a valuable means of earning a living as=
=20
writers. again the sounding or reading in public was a very important part=
=20
of the writing programs.
in the 80s the labor government of australia implemented a higher education=
=20
'rationalization' which aimed to reduce duplication and increase=20
efficiency. this saw the merging of colleges of education, institutes of=20

but generally by the 90s the public reading/performance of poetry and the=20
teaching of writing were accepted as more mainstream activities, and seen=20
as a part of our poetic culture.

since 1995 the commercial publication by major publishers is in decline as=

there is an active network of venues for weekly poetry sounding in each=20

schools are great sources of income for a poet too, teachers and librarians=
=20
keen to excite their students about contemporary language and its uses,=20
often invite performance poets to 'turn their children on' to poetry. i=20
always felt the greatest thing i could do when i went to a school was to=20
change the students' concept of what a poem looked like on a page, what it=

sounded like, what a poem could say, and how it could say it, so that it=20
was more relevant to their lives. i did not intend to make all students=20
great poets but at least convince them to not put up a barrier to poetry=20
because they thought it was too old fashioned and irrelevant to their=20

aspects of history and analysis.

i am now a tenured academic, i first taught university as a sessional=20
lecturer(adjunct?) in writing programs in nsw and queensland (1991 - 1999).=
=20
when i began teaching i began reading a lot more about australian poetry=20

been doing as a performance poet, i began to ask questions about my craft=20
and the theories of literature and life that inform it. i realized how=20

form in a nurturing environment informed by experience of those that have=20
been actively involved in the australian poetic culture, and being=20
encouraged to perform their work in public as well as seeking publication.

Another area of growth for poets in australia and globally has been the=20

more so a great new tool for creation. griffith university was quick to=20
recognize the importance of this new writing space and in 1998 i wrote and=

arts students.

well to finish and summarize, i believe writing programs are good but=20
should not be elevated or separated from their local or community activity.=

and that teaching performance and digital poetry is just as important as=20
teaching writing about, and for, print publication.

Jesse, I think this is Helen Adam's only stuff currently in print:


from Hanging Loose Press

Helen Adam, SAN FRANCISCO'S BURNING
The famous "ballad opera" now available, for the first time, in its
sparkling entirety. Full score by Al Carmines and other composers, witty
drawings by Jess.
"A unique, bizarre, and altogether beguiling ballad opera."--Small Press.
440 pages, including 200 pages of music in a separate section.
Paper: ISBN 0-914610-33-3, $15.00.
Cloth: ISBN 0-914610-43-0, $25.00. =A0

Helen Adam, GHOSTS AND GRINNING SHADOWS
The only published prose by the incomparable balladeer. Choice calls these
two long witch stories "a welcome and timely treat."
Fiction, 98 pages,
$8.00. ISBN 0-914610-10-4. =A0

In addition to the Crossing the Meridian K Prevallet's lovely essay on her
collages, I found a site devoted to her work by somebody named Barbara C.
Blehm: http://coe.west.asu.edu/394/TinaF/ppt%20intro/index.htm
This site has lots of information about her and other critics (i.e. Michael
Davidson)  that was new to me.
I first heard Helen Adam read her work at the SF State Poetry Center when I
was a student there in the very early sixties. She was genuinely spooky for
me to hear (some of the Ballads had such a sexually sadistic side all
wrapped up in couplets, no less!) - and I suspect she herself was spooked b=
y
her own material, as well, it certainly seemed to live very much inside her=
.
(Her day job was at a Pizza Parlor at the corner of Waller & Stanyan in the
Haight across from Golden Gate Park - she had absolutely no customer
interface and seemed to be off in another world, perhaps a few blocks away
up the hill in a rented room on the edge of Sutro Forest and Twin Peaks).
Later, when she came back from New York to perform in San Francisco in the
early seventies, a guest of Duncan, her performances seemed much more
polished and stylized ("belting it out" as you say - including dancing on
stage - and yet a step beyond the earlier space of my first encounter with
her and her work.)  Yet, she did live in a make believe world. When she and
her sister took the play, San Francisco's Burning (after a success here) to
New York, I believed they moved certain that the play (performed at I
believe The Judson Playhouse) would make her famous and financially
rewarded.  It didn't. Though my impression is that she achieved recognition
among some circles of NY poets, and certainly continued to get published.
In 1972, when I was the Director of Poetry In the Schools, I took her back
to Alameda, her first American childhood home, to read at an English class
at Alameda High School. She read several poems - creating quite a spell -
and then spent the rest of the hour reading Tarot cards for each student in
the class - all thrilled, of course (this was still what we call essentiall=
y
the sixties.). It was incredibly generous, though I think she was also
hungry for human company.
When we drove back to the City through the tunnel under the Estuary (the
Alameda tube) she described how when she was in High School she used to lov=
e
to ride her bike through the tunnel, singing.

I suspect any criticism of Adam's work is always confronted with the issue
of conjoining such a retro/non modern form with a modern (or is it
post-modern) resonance. She, Duncan, and Spicer conference over the grave o=
f
Poe - and that chemistry releases something in each of them that still
jangles.=20

Following up on both Maria's and Arielle's ideas, I think we shd make
the Poetics reading a POETRY IS NEWS event. By the time of the
conference even larger numbers of soldiers & weapons will be in
position to invade, the war may have even commenced. If so, one wd
hope that AWP organizers will organize poetry activity, plenary
statements, etc. against it all. If they don't, we can insist on it.
Maybe the collective Arielle found can contact local poets to join
us. Maybe some of the New York PIN presenters will be in Baltimore
too or can come down (less than 3 hours by train). Eventually it cd
become the seed of a Baltimore chapter, along the lines Maria
suggested.

As for so-and-so's put-down of the city, he clearly doesn't know much
abt it. (While forgetting the importance of librarians and music
teachers--To poetry even and teenagers who become "cool.") I wd add
to the previous mention of Poe*, etc.: JOHN WATERS (Baltimore has an
official John Waters Day--he's lived there most of his life); BILLIE
HOLIDAY (born there--there's an annual BH vocal competition and a
statue on Pennsylvania Ave.); ADRIENNE RICH, also born there.
Gertrude Stein went to med. school there-there and thrived on the
intellectual environment around Johns Hopkins. If you're a baseball
fan, it was the childhood home of the Bambino. Not an uncool
locale/tradition at all.

Not to mention three extraordinary museums, an overabundance of great food,
including a regional cuisine, local and thriving folk art traditions,
vibrant visual arts and music scenes, and great bars and street life. But
of course most of us will be locked in the venue for the duration. For a
break I'd suggest at least The Museum of Visionary Art.

Baltimore is one of our better cities, but a convention center could be
anywhere.

I am looking for the best biography of Baudelaire. Which one is it? Length
is no object --multivolume OK --but it needs to be in Inglish. And
well-informed about the drugs. Also I'd like to know about C.S. Peirce's
drug use. Someone must have an opinion on this --GO RAIDERS and please tell
me, either b/c or let the whole world know LRSN
PS I really do love that book Star, does someone want to fight about it?

we have our assessments for writing for performance at regular community
poetry venues, so that there is an audience of peers, teachers and general
public.

i think the workshop situation is fine -if you don't discuss the work of
people in the workshop. when i was doing my ma(creative writing) our
seminar/workshops would usually discuss the reading for that week, eg
benjamin's 'state of art in the age of mechanical reproduction, stein's
centenary lectures, barthes on autibiography, susan sontag on photography,
janet malcolm's biography of plath biographies, etc.
we would prepare creative responses to the items we were studying each week
and present those at the workshop for discussion.

our written work for our personal writing projects was only discussed with
our supervisor.

i don't think having a blog that allows written comments from others is
such a bad idea although i haven't tried it. it could stop a lot of
personality based criticism if people have to commit comments to writing.

and of course as much contact with writers as possible.

cheers

i agree w/ kasey and gabe on this one.
one reason i think the atmosphere in mfa programs suffers is because
often they are anti-theoretical and anti-intellectual (not the
students' fault but sometimes these splits between "literature" and
"creative writing" aspects of a dept reflect faculty factions left
over from a pre-theory model of literary scholarship and a
pre-"language" era model of the unalienated writer, etc.). mfa
programs are stigmatized from within the academy as "soft" and from
outside the academy as "academic" --by which is meant many things:
tame, tweedy, overly cerebral, "safe" in the pejorative sense --both
in terms of a career path and in terms of the poetry mostly generated
there...  There is some truth to both charges, but students entering
programs aren't to blame. they are sometimes simply seeking to stave
off the impossible world of employment-for-humanists-and
-artists-outside-the-academy for a few years while they network,
write, etc.  i myself joined a phd program cuz reagan cut all the
programs that could possibly have employed me in my mid-20s.  if
there had been any arts/humanities-oriented degree that would have
taken longer, i'm sure i would have applied for that.  when people
ask why i got my doctorate or went into the academy, i usually say
1)to hide out the reagan years or 2)because it was for me the path of
least resistance.

This idea of poet as rebel is not interesting as style. The CEO of Visa,
the credit card company, used to ride his Harley to work. People who own
SUVs think SUVs are "cool" or "gnarly" or whatever the local lingo might
be.

Poets who actually do/write something that makes a difference in the
culture is in fact much more rare & far more variable as to personal
style. Ginsberg wore suits a lot in his later years.

I love the idea of a Poetry is News event--the only
problem is getting it together in time...

Another idea for a venue, and another reason Baltimore
is so cool--it has a great "outsider art" museum, the
American Visionary Art Museum.  In fact, I've
contacted them as well as a possible reading site, but
I don't have any contacts there--anyone else?

We could do as Walter says, and hold a guerilla
reading outside of Poe's home, but it'll probably be
pretty cold...and dark...

Mairead, Geoffrey, et al.,

I have no direct experience with low-residency MFA programs, but, as you all
probably know, it appears that many of them are built almost entirely around
mentorship. As far as I can tell, there is very little actual "workshopping"
and most or all of the work gets done in one-on-ones between mentor and
student, both face-to-face and by correspondence, and in lectures during
residencies, which are delivered both by mentors and by students.

On the other hand, some low-residency MFA programs seem to exist solely for
the purpose of bringing in revenue, which I suspect is the case with many
more traditional MFA programs and is part of the reason why we have such a
glut of teaching job applicants and why some people extrapolate this
cynicism to all MFA programs. But the programs are full, so there must be a
market demand for them. Is there a conflict here between market demand and
"professional" need for these programs to exist? What's the difference?

Here in Dallas, the local literary center, The Writer's Garret, runs an
affordable, non-academic program of "community and mentorship" for writers
who aren't interested in paying for a degree or in devoting their lives
full-time to a course of study. Perhaps other non-academic literary centers
have similar programs. The element of the program that appeals most to the
participants is, in fact, the one-on-one mentorship program.

However, I would be interested to know whether those of us who have gone
through MFA/PhD programs in creative writing and close facsimiles thereof,
got the most value out of mentor relationships, out of workshopping, or
elsewhere. In my case, without a doubt (at SUNY-Binghamton), the greatest
value came from relationships with other students.

I believe I already posted this (I, too, am feeling
Beckett-ish), but I have contacted Atomic Books (too
small), the Red Room (waiting to hear back), and the
American Museum of Visionary Art (ditto).  Will let
you all know if anything comes of it.  Other people
are free to pursue other leads, of course!

One of the pibs in Fells Point would probably be a better idea--closer, and
reachable by land and from the convention site by regular boat service. If
this sounds good, I'll make some queries. But best of all would be
something onsight, and I guess the powers that be will know if that's possible.

On Thursday there's an Ohio University alumni get together and reading at
Bertha's Mussels, Fells Point at 730 South Broadway. I know nothing about
about this space, but it is a bar/restaurant. Is it worth a thought for a Poetics is

I'm stuck on this review and could use a suggestion of a poetics book that
explores thick description?  ideas?

tom bell

"Thick Description

Review of Dourish, Paul, Where the Action Is: the Foundations of Embodied
Interaction, Cambridge, MIT, 2001.

     As someone who always seems to be in the thick 1     of things I
eagerly anticipated this book.  In some ways my expectations were fulfilled.
However, I was disappointed not to receive much guidance through the Action
or process of being in the thick of things.   Perhaps that was an
unrealistic expectation.  But let me be a little more specific.

    Dourish does do an admirable job of weaving together some of the
philosophical and cultural underpinnings of this approach to the
technological world we live and write in.  He also presents a refreshing
perspective on a world where newer versions are often pursued for their own
sakes.  There was little in the way of guidance through the process of
finding oneself in the thick of Human Computer Interaction (HCI)
specifically or generally as a writer or viewer.    There was no "get a new
system" or "buy this or that gadget."  This is also not a "how-to."  This is
a book for designers of systems.  But there was also little in the way of
guidance toward becoming a "being-in-the-world" designer although one could
of course turn to the philosophers on this or examine field notes in
particular other domains for hints. As I said above this might be an
unrealistic expectation here.

     I do come down heavy here on the issue as I think Dourish is on to
something.  He just doesn't carry it far enough into the process he
examines.  As he points out in a slightly different context, "there is a
considerable difference between using the real world as a metaphor for
interaction and using it as a medium for interaction."  What we have here is
HCI as a metaphor for interaction   I would have liked to hear more from HCI
as a medium of interaction.

1. Dourish uses this apt phrase  as applied to Malinowski by Geertz who
derived it from Ryle but as he points out it is also applicable to
approaches in many fields,.  He includes here participant observation  and
the 'tacit' dimension.

Baltimore was also the scene, sad to say, of Countee Cullen's "Incident,"
and hadn't changed much when I first visited around the same age Cullen had
been -- but it has certainly changed considerably since then and has become
a place I love to visit --

"The Arcades Project" has a piece at the end, "The Ring of Saturn (or Some
Remarks on Iron Construction), which may have been for the radio.

I just published "The Peripheral space of Photography," which has some
connections to Benjamin's thinking. Benjamin undermines the idea of
"professional expert" particularly because most of his observations on social
constructs (architecture, photography, diaromas, history, narrative,
translation, etc,, etc.) undermine established, "professional" ideas.

"Nonetheless, even though it is possible to recognize the death instinct
as a new guise for a basic and constant sine qua non of Freudian thought,
it must be emphasized that its introduction does embody a new conceptual
departure: the death instinct makes the destructive tendency, as revealed
for example in sado-masochism, into an irreducible datum; it is further-
more the chosen expression of the most fundamental principle or psychical
functioning; and lastly, in so far as it is 'the essence of the instinct-
ual', it binds every wish, whether aggressive or sexual, to the wish for
death." (Laplanche and Pontalis, The Language of Psychoanalysis, p. 103.)

Hey y'all,
    I've been quietly watching all the antiwar stuff being thrown
around on the list lately, and i'll be checking out the "poetry is
news" thing in a few days...but in any case, i'd be interested to
see what people had to say if we took the discussion back a step
and explained exactly why we're against the war.  I liked Nick's
comments a few weeks ago about the danger of polarizing the debate
in this situation...the more the academic/literary world resorts to
the sort of sloganeering and rhetoric we see coming from the right,
the easier it is to dismiss academics and writers as hopeless (and
ultimately harmless) radicals.  America's contemporary cultural
environment has done as good a job at appropriating and rendering
impotent its leftist academics and literary professionals as it has
appropriating the once radical (and genuinely negative) position of
punk or hip hop culture.  Being antiwar becomes a fashionable
identity just like any other--here at Columbia there's an enormous
amount of social pressure to be antiwar (whether you're teaching a
class or taking it) but there's very little intellegent discussion
about why one is antiwar--all that's really required to be in the
anti-war club is signing a few petitions and making witty remarks
about W's stupidity over cocktails.
         Not to say that taking a moment to state why you're
against the war will magically change any of this, and not to say
that the poetics list is populated by cocktail party pacifists, but
i think putting down a paragraph on why you're against the war is
an interesting step in the right direction...I know i've been
guilty from time to time of making a flipant comment about the
idiocy of Bush's policies from time to time when, had i took the
time to do so, i might have made someone take a minute to think
about their pro-war stance, or even just about their lack of action
in support of their proclaimed anti-war stance.
       So, having said all that, here's my paragraph about why i
don't support the war...

      I'm probably on the right side of the spectrum (yikes!) as
far as the list goes (or maybe just the overly idealistic side) in
that my justification does not have to do with an opposition to US
hegemony as such (i'm still clinging to my last shreds of faith in
the power of democratic ideals to achieve a more just and even
egalitarian society) but rather due to a commitment in non-
violence...I think violence is a mistake in almost any situation,
whether in the name of Marxist values, Islamic Values, or the empty
and supposedly democratic values that the administration is tossing
around in order to justify this war.  Were the administration to
demonstrate that there Saddam posed an imminent threat of
instigating an armed conflict (or a terrorism campaign) that would
even come close to spilling as much blood as a US campaign in Iraq
would, then the judgement might be more tricky...but as is the
administration has provided no evidence that an armed conflict is
justified on anything other than economic grounds.

So, obviously a very rudimentary sort of justification...but i
think it'd be really interesting to just hear even the most basic
ideological stances that we have on the list.  Cheers

Hello everyone,

Just a reminder--the submission deadline for [Two] Factorial is February
1st, 2003.

<----new!---->
In the style of the Heian period: sitting around with any number of
friends, writers, lovers, anyone--please write something
together--literally, physically, temporally--and send it in, along with the
time/date and geographical location. A selection will be printed
anonymously, with only the date and place as identification.

For this project only: e-mail submissions are acceptable, in PDF or
MS-Word, to sawako@factorial.org. Please send hard copy of any
visual/handwritten text to 516 N. Main Street, Apt.3, Bloomington, IL  61701.

____________________________________

        [Two] Factorial--Call for Work

Please refer to the first issue, [One] Factorial, to see how some writers
and artists have approached collaboration. While we are excited by the
range of collaborative projects in the first issue, we hope the work and
discussions included in it offer themselves more as points of proliferation
than models to be emulated.

        [One] Factorial is available for $6:
        (payable to Sawako Nakayasu; but correspondence must be addressed to
!Factorial Press.)

        !Factorial Press
        PO Box 153106
        San Diego, CA  92195-3106.

        http://www.factorial.org


Possibilities:

-->  Any work that responds to or engages with the discussions in part two
of [One] Factorial is particularly welcome;

-->  Any submissions of work that uses a title from Keith Waldrop's _Titles
for Sale_ should enclose $2/title, in a check made out to Keith Waldrop;

-->  A collaborative process does not always have to be collaboratively
"generative," but can be "degenerative" (Example: Keith and Rosmarie
Waldrops' "Words Worth Less," a collaboration where they began with a
Wordsworth poem and alternated removing words from the original and each
other's pared down offerings);

-->  And as usual: plays, performance text, transcriptions, instructions,
narrative, conversations, essays, poems, definitions, manifestos,
incidental text, and various combinations thereof;

-->  OR descriptions, ideas, processes, proposals, possible & impossible
imaginings of collaborative projects for the (Collaborating [On)
Collaborating] section.

--> Note: the main focus of the journal is still text-collaborations,
although we welcome work that also engages with the musical, visual,
temporal, and performative.

-->  Electronic collaborations will be considered for publication on the
website.


Please send 1 to 15 pages of hard copy.

Send *two* copies of all submissions to:

!Factorial Press
Sawako Nakayasu & Mark Tardi, Editors

Rhyme time: Poetry's in motion toward more recognition
By JOHN MARK EBERHART
The Kansas City Star

Attention, you poets, you bards, you madmen; hark, you readers of verse,
you lovers of ditties, you suckers for simile; listen up, all you
cracked people who believe poetry matters: These days, you might be
right.

Poetry's hour seems to have come 'round again. HBO's popular "Def Poetry
Jam" series has become a Broadway show. Literary journals that can print
350 poems a year are getting 90,000 submissions. And while the
publishing industry continues to struggle in the wake of the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, poetry collections are selling better than
ever.

All this for a genre that even 10 years ago seemed to be dying, or
living on only in academic circles, its audiences dwindling. Is
renaissance too strong a word for what's happening now?

"Not at all," said Deborah Garrison, a former New Yorker editor and now
the poetry editor for publisher Alfred A. Knopf. "In a much darker world
at large, there's a need for something that speaks to the heart."

Paul Bogaards, Knopf's executive director of publicity, said the
publisher sells about 250,000 copies of poetry volumes annually and
estimates that poetry sales have grown 15 percent to 20 percent in the
last five years.

Meanwhile, Bogaards said, fiction -- novels, story collections -- is
hurting.

"Some (big-name) fiction authors are experiencing an erosion of sales of
10 to 30 percent," Bogaards said. "It's been a tough (year and a half)
for our business. That's why the news about poetry is such an
affirmation."

Chicago's respected Poetry magazine, founded in 1912, receives 90,000
poem submissions per year, and can use 300 to 350. In the early '90s,
the figure was about 60,000, senior editor Stephen Young said. (In a
vote of confidence of another sort, billionaire pharmaceutical heiress
Ruth Lilly recently bequeathed a huge sum of money to Poetry.)

It's the same story at New Letters, published at the University of
Missouri-Kansas City, where editor Robert Stewart can print 150 poems a
year but sees more than 30,000 poems annually; 20 years ago, he said,
the quarterly journal saw "one quarter to half of that, at most."

So more people are reading and writing poetry. But why now?

"Maybe it's just dumb luck," said Kansas City poet William Peck. "It
could be that, lately, poetry has come into fashion a little bit. To be
honest with you, I do think that's part of it."

Peck also thinks "the rise of musical forms like rap have made lyrical
content more important to people." In other words, the hipness of
hip-hop transfers to poetry.

At 9 p.m. the first Sunday of each month, Peck is host for the Westport
Poetry Slam. Some nights, more than 100 people press into Stanford and
Sons at 504 Westport Road to hear poets belt out the word.

It ain't no lecture hall. The language can be raw. Tempers can flare.

"We make 'em cringe sometimes," Peck said. "You can get up there and say
anything you want, and I'm not going to stop you, because I am very much
against censorship. But people may not like what you say. You may get up
there and start doing some pro-choice poem, and if you've got strong
pro-life people in the crowd ... you're taking a real chance you might
get a hostile reaction."

But that's always been one of poetry's roles: To challenge, not just
comfort -- as when Langston Hughes lashed out in verse against racism.

U.S. poet laureate Billy Collins thinks poetry is more accessible now
than in previous decades.

"We're still in a recovery mode at this point," Collins said in a recent
interview. "And (one thing) readers are recovering from (is) ... high
modernism. The leaders of that movement were people like Wallace
Stevens, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound and Hart Crane, who were moving poetry
away from its Victorian frilliness and trying to write a poetry that was
more in tune with the times, which were very unsettled times.

"So there came to be a connection between difficulty and value. If you
went to school during the period those poets were in their ascent, you
basically had to deal with extremely difficult poetry, and I think we're
still recovering from that."

Which isn't to say that poetry is being dumbed down. Young and Stewart
think their literary journals receive more poetry now partly because of
the emergence of strong postgraduate writing programs across the nation.

Said Young: "In my 15 years at Poetry, submissions have increased 50
percent, but the general quality of the poems has risen, too."

There's another factor, too: Technology.

"It has allowed poets to mass-market their work," Stewart said. Before
computers and desktop publishing, New Letters would see a group of poems
from a poet, then that poet might send the work somewhere else if New
Letters didn't nibble. Now, Stewart said, poets easily can send out
multiple submissions to multiple magazines.

Off the page

Poetry was once predominantly oral: Bards performed poems; often, they
were accompanied by music. But the more dominant the written form
became, the more poetry was confined to the page.

Few have done more to push poetry back off that page than comedic
impresario Russell Simmons and his partner,
producer/director/co-conceiver Stan Lathan. The pair created "Def Poetry
Jam" and made it a hit on HBO. The series features edgy poets who shout
out verses that are fresh and immediate.

Last November, Simmons and Lathan launched "Def Poetry Jam on Broadway,"
a production starring nine poets with names like "Black Ice" and "Lemon"
who declaim in-your-face verses about subjects personal and political.

Lathan said he and Simmons brought an ongoing phenomenon to wider
attention.

"One thing Russell and I make clear is that we didn't discover anything;
we exposed it to a larger audience. There's always been poetry performed
in coffeehouses and things like that, but over the last 10 years or so,
there's been a proliferation of clubs where poetry nights happen on a
regular basis.

"And then the phenomenon of the slams came along, which are essentially
poetry competitions. In those, the performance element became more
important, because in order to win a slam, you'd have to not only write
a great poem but perform it with a certain amount of energy and
excitement."

The Broadway production tries to reflect that fervent spirit by changing
with the times, Lathan said. Since the show opened, several poems have
morphed to follow current events. A poem called "Terrorist Threat" --
already heavy on nervy political humor -- "has been adjusted to include
some of the Trent Lott faux pas."

Despite all the attention, is poetry really a "mainstream" art form now?
Some are believers. Some are skeptics.

Garrison, Knopf's poetry editor, is a believer. For one thing, she said,
poetry has been more visible in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001.

"After Sept. 11, I didn't say, `Oh, I feel like going to the ballet,' "
Garrison said. "And I'm not dissing the ballet. But poetry captures an
essence of feelings of all kinds. People were e-mailing poems around the
country. Poetry is weirdly utilitarian, because it's so distilled -- in
less than five minutes, you can read a poem and have an experience."

Knopf's stable of poets -- stellar names such as Sharon Olds, Anthony
Hecht and John Updike -- is having success in print. Five years ago,
selling 1,000 copies of a poetry book was a feat. But Knopf is seeing
numbers two and three times that level for some titles.

Ann Volin is one of those who are more skeptical about poetry's impact.

Volin reserves judgment because she works on the front lines -- teaching
poetry at the University of Kansas, striving to get students interested
in verse.

"It's pretty unanimous that they think music has taken over the role as
the art form that speaks for their generation," Volin said. "They do see
the connection between song lyrics and poetry, but poetry itself is not
as important. But I do think there has been some warming up, and some of
that comes from music and rap lyrics."

Volin does her part to bring poetry's rowdier side into the classroom.
Each semester, she convenes a poetry panel with invited speakers that
have included Peck, the man behind the Westport slam.

Last November, as the nation rumbled with talk of war with Iraq, Peck
faced an auditorium of students with a new poem he had written -- a
rip-snorter called "Oh, say, can you see?"

It was an overtly political piece, seemingly critical of not only war in
general but also the current administration in particular.

Peck barreled through it, reciting from memory. The words tore through
the room, but at the end ... silence.

For a moment.

Then a student in the front row gave a whoop. Not the kind of sound one
usually hears in "the academy."

But that's the sound of poetry: The conviction of one soul that
provokes, in another, a shout of recognition.

The branches run like veins, like
looming cracks; the human is
prismatic with shattering.

Another day a rock flings itself
across the windshield. We have to call
the insurance company amid so much
dryness and spitting of the mud of our
skin. Okay, we'll fix it Saturday, they
assure us. Sleeping through an invoice
slipped between screen and door.

I tried to talk about it, but the words
flew back into my mouth. They
were rightly scared, all the adobe
judges who withstood rain stood with
tears on their nails, aching to hang
me up. All I wanted to say was

Don't look down. The nets are like
the hair of mathematics down there.
I look up and my glasses crackle and
judges separate from the waist.
They look me up and down.

I begin to sway. Back and forth. Rusting
the air with a thirst of new moon.

At his blog, Ron Silliman seems to be saying that
Robert Grenier was the founder, or main founder, of
language poetry.  I'm terrible on literary history,
especially that of language poetry, so wonder how true
those more knowledgeable about it take this to be.

Ron also opines that Grenier's *Sentences* still
qualifies as the furthest anyone has pushed poetry &
form in the investigation of the world."  I AM enough
of a literary historian to know that this is certainly
not true.  It may be possible reasonably to claim that
Grenier pushed poetry and form as far as anyone, but
further?  It's extremely hard to make comparisons
(because of the apples/pears problem, among other
things) but it seems to me Ron is overlooking Stein,
Pound, Cummings and Aram Saroyan, for a start--and all
of visual poetry and later pluraesthetic works.  I
would add that in some respects, *Sentences* is pretty
straightforward minimalism that's been around quite a
while.  I suspect he was much influenced by Williams,
for instance--but I admit to not knowing as much as I
want to about Grenier's work, so may be way off.

By the way, thanks to those of my friends who welcomed
me back to this place.  Now I hope I can just remember
to get out to Yahoo every once in a while, to read the
list posts.  I used to get them conveniently where I
get all my other e.mail.

1. war will kill lots of innocent people, including children, and
including Americans.
2. there is no proof that Iraq has WMDs.
3. even if Iraq did have WMDs, the C.I.A. has published its opinion that
Saddam is unlikely to use them unless backed into a corner, which is what
attacking Iraq would do.
4. there is no proof that Iraq supports Al Qaeda.
5. "pre-emptive" strikes are morally wrong and unAmerican
6. We are not attacking other countries with WMDs, including Pakistan,
North Korea and Israel; why would we attack Iraq? (In the case of North
Korea, which has been certified evil by the prez, it would seem that we
are not attacking them because they do have WMDs and could use them. This
would suggest that America is willing to attack Iraq because we're pretty
sure they *don't* have them.)
7. America should not be the police of the world.
8. More anti-American terrorism will result from American aggression.

I have and Ammiel's all for it, but he sd that one of his Poetry Is
News colleagues may already have something in the works. I'll
back-channel some of the Poetics people who've shown interest
(Arielle, etc.) abt it in case he/she doesn't want the plan discussed
widely yet.

I think this allows another question to be raised: the idea of a
reading during (if not at) the AWP was originally raised in reference
to last year's reading, which I did not attend, and not in the
context of the threatened war, the many-headed Bush monster, etc. It
may be the case that there are people on this list going to Baltimore
who want to read but not as part of a PIN-type event. If so, perhaps
some of us shd just join the PIN event that is supposedly in the
works (if there is room) while a reading that has a less focused
agenda is separately organized. (Of c, it wd still be possible at the
latter for individual readers to address the political issues.) What
do you think? I hope that we can hear back from the PIN planner soon.

Just so you all know, a group of local Baltimore Writers, the Dissociated
Writers Project (DWP), is planning a sort of shadow conference of panel
discussions and readings in Baltimore at the same time as the AWP, Feb
27-Mar 1, sponsored by Blue Collar Books, a local independent publisher.

About the only thing we're convinced of is that the AWP is a bunch of
wusses.

Check out our website: www.dissociatedwritersproject.com

Hundreds of hours have gone into the planning of the DWP conference. For the
past month or so we've pretty much stopped writing to plan. Which is amazing
because the only thing that could ever get us to stop writing is basically
nothing.

If anybody wants to read at the conference, please feel free to submit to
our contest. I'd love to offer all interested parties space at our reading.
But the nice part about our readings is no writer has precedence. Every
voice has to compete not on the basis of authority or publications to date,
but the quality of the work. The stranger or more challenging the better.
Winners will not only read at the conference but be published on our web
site.

All of the contest readers are familiar with the work of poets on the
Buffalo listserv, so we know that by inviting your work we're inviting
quality.

There will be performances, panel discussions, pranks. The planning for this
conference has been enormous. We advertised at the peace protest this
weekend, handing out thousands of flyers. And word continues to spread.

Attendees at the conference will come from not so standard places, which is
the most exciting part to us. And the whole thing is free. On the final
night, one of the best area punk bands, the Black Eyes (the record label
Dischord's new darling), will perform. And we're still in the process of
trying to get John Waters to appear at our panel discussion on "Is Bad
Writing Good." One of our organizers has offered to give him antlers mounted
on a board and a blowjob. Waters is still thinking about it.

Well, I'm certain there are few on the list who would happen to have been
jailed in the same state while working for the same organization in the
same year -- not sure what that's supposed to mean -- equally sure others
of us have been jailed elsewhere in association with other works --

and it has never been my understanding that being in agreement with "most
of the country" was a standard for academic employment -- and it was, in
fact, the attempt of UC Berkeley to prevent students from using campus
grounds to recruit for activities like those for which you were arrested
back in '67 (with which most of the country disagreed at the time) that
brought about the Free Speech Movement --

but, as you say, that's not your point -- I don't think any of us ever
thought it was --

i really really appreciate alex young's provocation---that took some courage...

so here you are:

i'm against the war, to date, not b/c i'm a pacifist (or for that
matter, an isolationist), but b/c i don't think war is the answer to
the problem(s) before us... i *do* think we have a problem
specifically with hussein, and i *do* think it would go a long way
were we to recognize a palestinian state, redistribute wealth (food,
clothing, shelter, etc.), exhaust all diplomatic means, and stop
acting culturally (and morally) superior... but whether the latter
will likely save the bacon that needs saving in the short
term---that's a tough question... and for that matter, redistribute
all the wealth you want, and you'll still likely have a tyrant or two
with whom to deal, one who's wreaking all manner of grief and
violence, at the very least, on his own people... i mean, there are
causes, proximate causes, and so forth...

so, i don't think diplomacy has a chance in this world, as things
stand, w/o the threat of military action, i.e., w/o a strong defense,
and preferably, an international defense contingent, sure
(sorry---and yes, ours is without doubt too taxpayer endowed, for
that matter)... i *do* think the u.s. should act in concert with the
u.n., but i *do* think the u.s. has the moral imperative to intervene
at times (as we should have done, i'd say, in rwanda and
cambodia---or as we should have agitated for)... which is to say, if
the argument is that we don't act until the u.n. is the type of
international agency we want it to be (with appropriate, and not
imbalanced, u.s. presence), we'll likely risk all manner of inequity
and injustice, as i see it... further, i *don't* think the argument
that iraq is one of many oppressive regimes that we're *not*
threatening to attack is a workable argument---i could as easily say
(and i'm not), "let's start with iraq"... and i *do* respect the more
pacifist claim that violence begets more violence, albeit i don't
personally endorse same in all contexts, as once one is past a
certain international breaking point, it seems to me that war is
inevitable (wwii the obvious example, and i won't beat that drum
anymore than it needs beating... and a parallel form of this argument
obtains at the personal level, as well)...

for the record, i also see the logic of opposing the war w/o further
ideo/logical refinement, given that we would seem to be on the brink
of same, and that my reservations about the left (as above, which are
along the lines of christopher hitchens's reservations, albeit
absent, i trust, his pugnacious form of interventionism) might be
properly muted for the sake of a united front... but if the left
can't do better, in my view, than it's been doing---publicly,
intellectually---then i'd say we'll find ourselves back on the brink
of war sooner than later (and i'm not ignorant of the ways in which
media realities give short shrift to leftist ideological platforms,
but still... e.g., a number of news commentators, e.g. chris
matthews, have come out against the war)... most petitions, emails
and calls-to-action i receive, and have been receiving, are much
better at saying what we're opposed to, political action wise, than
what we're in favor of ("we're in favor of peace" falling somewhat
short of what i have in mind)...

and i also understand, too, how the left tends to eat itself alive in
the light of public day---so please, i'm trying not to come off as
contentious here... i don't have any quick answers in line with what
i'm proposing, either---in fact, i think there are no easy "answers,"
that all remedies will be fraught at some level, and that this is one
reason why the debate as such has been so easily polarized publicly,
with bush & co simplifying matters to the point of absurdity (even as
they ruin the environment, curtail civil liberties, etc.), while
those of us who are anti-war have often appeared shrill and
reactionary in response:  content to consume as we may, presumably
entitled to enjoy a more comfy life than most of the planet (mea
culpa), but rather unable to articulate exactly what we want the govt
to *do* to prevent another 9.11...

in all, i think we can do better...

****

anyway, thanx for the opportunity to give voice to some ideas that,
to be candid, i've been sweating over lo these many months, even
while i place my phone calls to my congressional reps, etc etc etc...

best,

joe

Hi, I'm hoping someone can recommend a good
DVD/CD/video, etc., something with audio and/or visual
material, of interesting avant-garde performances by
poets, fiction writers, performance artists, spoken
word artists, etc.  The more eclectic the anthology
the better, but I don't want only "slam poets"--I'm
looking for things more along the lines of Carolee
Schneeman, John Cage, Tracie Morris, etc.  This is for
a course I'm teaching on avant-garde lit.  Please
backchannel with suggestions, thanks!

Arielle,

I'm sure you already know about this, but Patrick Durgin's audio issue of
_Kenning_ from last year seems made to order.  I have yet to purchase a copy
myself (guilt, guilt, guilt), but have heard some of the tracks, and have
seen it displayed proudly on the CD racks of many prominent, innovative, and
drop-dead sexy poets on both coasts.  STATE-O-DE-ART.

I forget how much it costs offhand, but Patrick's e-mail is
<pdurgin@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

If you put 2 + 2 together and hit Start > Programs >
Accessories > Calculator on that article,---

they're all in basic agreement about the mathematics
of the increase (if the numbers are evenly
distributed).

Knopf's Bogaards is estimating that there's a

     3%

per annum growth rate in poetry sales (15% in 5 years
[Note: SALES]).  Stephen Young of Poetry is saying
that there's been a

     3.3%

per annum increase in the number of submissions ("In
my 15 years at Poetry, submissions have increased 50
percent", or an increase of 30,000 over a decade, as
he puts in previously [Note: SUBMISSIONS]).  New
Letters' Robert Stewart confirms these numbers on the
low side when he gives a

     2.5%

per annum growth rate in the number of submissions
(50% over 20 years).

And, their approximations are consistent and concur
over a time range that these publishers variously each
give in terms of five year, ten year (or twelve, since
it's 2003 now), or twenty year increments.


Meanwhile, my earlier question about poetry
"renaissance" mapped against the over-all increase in
~population~ (sort of the distortion you get when you
inflate a balloon that has a magic marker drawing
squiggled on it):

http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0772762.html gives
U.S. resident population stats for half-centuries and
then each decade going back to 1790.

During the past decade or twenty years that these
publishers are discussing, those population statistics
likewise concur that there's been about a steady

     1.5%

per annum increase in the total population across both
those periods (1.21% yearly from 1980 to 1990, and
1.31% yearly from 1990 to 2000, when evenly
distributed [see below]).

If, then, half of the 3% yearly increase in the supply
of poems is shaved away because of the 1.5% population
increase in the ~expectable~ number of suppliers, from
sheer birth rate alone, as I think it definitely
should be,--- what we're left with are much more
modest numbers.


   * A 1.5% yearly growth rate ~"renaissance"?~ *




The slippage or distortion of terms in the article
comes from the way that the Kansas City journalist,
John Eberhart, (and I'm not dissing Kansas City)
shuffles the supply side numbers with the consumption
numbers, and the increase in poetry sales with the
decrease in "Some (big-name) fiction author" sales.

(Note: Knopf's Bogaard is guesstimating about ~"Some
(big-name) fiction author"~ sales, and not about
fiction sales in general. [I recall seeing total
industry figures that showed, the opposite of what
Bogaard is representing, a 27% increase in the sale of
books in general *in a period of months* at the
beginning of 2002, since, after all, the drop-off was
largely economy-/9/11-induced.] The sales of big-name
authors, like their unreasonable advances, may have
been grossly swollen in the first place, by temporary,
sensationalism-/advertising-fueled expansion that a
market like that cannot sustain.  In which case, it's
the artificially pumped-up big-name sales that have
simply undergone a "market correction."  And the
questionable significance of a 1.5% increase in poetry
sales/supply suggests, rather, some slight, gradual
non-market snail's pace, basically just centimetering
upward and acting the way it's always acted.)

When numbers are used the way Eberhart juggles them in
that article, they should have scare quotes around
them,--- as you have to constantly cross-question what
they're talking about, and it's all quite dubious.  A
good deal of the shock and innumerate number-vertigo
that Eberhart achieves comes from reminding us, or
informing the Kansas City Star readers, that "top"
literary journals report such breathtaking numbers
about how many submissions they get.

Young is saying that Poetry receives 90,000 "poem
submissions" per year (the point is made slightly
clearer in the second paragraph where it's distinct
that that's 90,000 ~poems~ [versus the 350 poems they
have space for] and not 90,000 poets' submissions, an
important difference).  Stewart is more immediately
direct that it's 30,000 ~poems~ they're getting.

Sure, no matter which way you cut it it sounds like a
heap (s--t load) and no clerical worker wants to cope
with a mailman like that,--- but--- the amateurs, too,
are very well instructed by how-to manuals like ~The
Poet's Market~ that x to 5 poems is the appropriate
amount to include in an envelope.  So, what that
really means is that, on any work day, New Letters
would be receiving about

     23 envelopefuls

and Poetry, about

     69

(in a year with 261 workdays, not counting holidays.
[30,000 / 5 = 6,000 & 6,000 / 261 = 22.99, etc]).

Granted, the sight of 23 envelopes filled with
villanelles and, worse, pantoums may be enough to send
any male admin. assistant to acting out in the men's
room by at least three o'clock in the afternoon at the
latest,--- but, big deal! it's nowhere near the horror
story that 90,000 conjures up.  I mean, there are a
lot of businesses where if all you had to process was
23 envelopefuls of incoming work, you'd be ~dancing.~
Speed-read each one in a *max* of five minutes (you
can tell by the second page and the "fancy fonts" and
buff stationery whether it's viable or not) and still
have five hours left over in a seven hour work day
with *nothing to do* (except hang out in the Men's
Room).  (Not to mention that any envelopes with kitten
stickers or glitter dust on the outside can be
processed in five seconds and a good ring toss around
the office.)

So, what are they complaining about?! ---and what are
they ~crowing~ about with this 1.5% miracle and the
awesome burden of two dozen envelopes a day?  They're
going to get an effin' $3,333,333 a year for the next
30 years! so that's, like, $37.04 ~per~ envelope they
get to move it from the slush pile to the mush pile.


The numbers in this article prove the ~opposite~ of
any "renaissance" or up book market.  They're showing
a supply/consumption that's barely holding steady,
save for that unexamined 1.5%.

(I'd be very curious to know the increase in the
number of people enrolled in college over those twenty
years, which is a significant influence in "becoming a
poet" and, I would think, probably way, way higher
than that margin--- in which case even 1.5% wouldn't
hold up as meaningful against a college-educated
literacy that should've been way above that.  1.5%,
not dwindling.)

All errors are my own.

-------------------------------------------------------



(As a newly converted balletomane myself who, unlike
Knopf's Deborah Garrison, in fact ~began~ going to the
ballet only after 9/11, I find her "I didn't say, `Oh,
I feel like going to the ballet' . . . And I'm not
dissing the ballet" to be disingenous and bothersome
and I take it as a personal insult ---especially if
that's the cultural facade double-punch of the ~poetry
editor~ at Knopf.  ~She's~ going to adjudicate on
whether to re-print James Merrill, ---James Merrill
whose "remembrances" were included in Christopher
Ramsey's ~Tributes: Celebrating 50 Years of New York
City Ballet,~ whom J. D. McClatchy eulogizes on a
Knopf web site with "He was a soft touch, and had
learned the difficult art of giving money away
gracefully ... [in response to] appeals from ballet
companies".

----You mean, THE Deborah Garrison, right? the author
of the ~Random House~ (Knopf)

     ~A Working Girl Can't Win: And Other Poems~

who

http://www.hyperage.com/search/agerID.cfm?agerID=1795

makes the sole point of saying was born in the Year of
The Snake, right?

She didn't FEEL LIKE IT coincidentally the same season
that *the first black man* ever was dancing the
principal role in ABT, maybe! and because she's so
~sick~ of Knopf throwing grand tier $90 freebies
across her deck that she's flattened all the sequins
on her gown from sitting through consecutive matinee
and evening performances of ~Giselle~ alone.

(What is the name for the rhetorical trope she's
tripping off ---"apophasis"?--- pretending to deny
what is really affirmed or introducing an attack only
under the guise of immediately erasing it: "I'm not
saying that she's some sort of complete
Vaganova/Balanchine junkie...!"?)

There's some sly deck-cutting Deborah's doing there,
trying to redeem poetry from its reputation as effete
and elitist by grasping after a cultural sitting duck
that Knopf is betting Kansas City newspaper readers
would find even more effete and elitist than poetry.

Then, can we salvage ballet by saying we didn't feel
like going to "Samuel Pepys and Music" that night?

"Please Fire Me" by Deborah Garrison

       Here comes another alpha male,
       and all the other alphas
       are snorting and pawing,
       kicking up puffs of acrid dust

       while the silly little hens
       clatter back and forth
       on quivering claws and raise
       a titter about the fuss.

       Here comes another alpha male--
       a man's man, a dealmaker,
       holds tanks of liquor,
       charms them pantsless at lunch:

       I've never been sicker.
       Do I have to stare into his eyes
       and sympathize? If I want my job
       I do. Well I think I'm through

       with the working world,
       through with warming eggs
       and being Zenlike in my detachment
       from all things Ego.

       I'd like to go
       somewhere else entirely,
       and I don't mean
       Europe.

"Fight Song" by Deborah Garrison

          Sometimes you have to say it:
          Fuck them all.

          Yes fuck them all --
          the artsy posers,
          the office blowhards
          and brown-nosers;

          Fuck the type who gets the job done
          and the type who stands on principle;
          the down-to-earth and understated;
          the overhyped and underrated;
          . . .
          which is to say fuck yourself and the person
you were: polite and
          mature,
          a trooper for good. . . .



"Father R.I.P., Sums Me Up at Twenty-Three"
by Deborah Garrison

          She agreed, she agreed, she seconded his
thesis,
          and with each murmured yes her
          certainty mounted:
          she would never be one of them --
          a Director, a Manager,
          an Executive Thingy. She didn't have the
ambition.
          She was simply a pencil, scratching,
pausing,
          picking her way down an obscure page.



"Worked Late on a Tuesday Night" by Deborah Garrison

          . . . Are her roots
          rural, right-leaning? Is she Jewish,
          self-hating? Past her sell-by date,
          or still ovulating?

quickly:

it IS a kneejerk reaction in me to be against everything bush is for, but,
like eschewing cigarettes and trying not to eat red meat, one i consider
largely healthy, and so i rarely question it. above and beyond the good
points that people have already made for being anti-war (and which, for the
most part, one can find readily disseminated at any peace rally, which
doesn't make them any less valid), i truly believe that a big enough public
groundswell can actually stop the war. perhaps that's an illusion about my
country and my government that is particular to myself or my generation, the
way people used to believe that government was generally honest a generation
or more ago.

and while that's not a "reason" for being against the war per se, the belief
that being actively against the war can have an effect is what separates us
from the many thousands who don't bother to vote, march, write letters, etc.

why i'm against the war was crystallized for me again during the march last
saturday, when i saw, again, many many children marching and chanting (in a
very real way, "leading" the rest of us). i don't want to have to look them
in the eyes years from now, when the planet has been reduced to a smokey
rock by war and greed (land-greed, oil-greed, water-greed), and say that i
sat back and did nothing. i can't do it. i won't do it. i consider it my
civic duty to protest the war, just as i would to vote or to give blood or
to write.

i really really appreciate alex young's provocation---that took some
courage...

so here you are:

i'm against the war, to date, not b/c i'm a pacifist (or for that
matter, an isolationist), but b/c i don't think war is the answer to
the problem(s) before us... i *do* think we have a problem
specifically with hussein, and i *do* think it would go a long way
were we to recognize a palestinian state, redistribute wealth (food,
clothing, shelter, etc.), exhaust all diplomatic means, and stop
acting culturally (and morally) superior... but whether the latter
will likely save the bacon that needs saving in the short
term---that's a tough question... and for that matter, redistribute
all the wealth you want, and you'll still likely have a tyrant or two
with whom to deal, one who's wreaking all manner of grief and
violence, at the very least, on his own people... i mean, there are
causes, proximate causes, and so forth...

so, i don't think diplomacy has a chance in this world, as things
stand, w/o the threat of military action, i.e., w/o a strong defense,
and preferably, an international defense contingent, sure
(sorry---and yes, ours is without doubt too taxpayer endowed, for
that matter)... i *do* think the u.s. should act in concert with the
u.n., but i *do* think the u.s. has the moral imperative to intervene
at times (as we should have done, i'd say, in rwanda and
cambodia---or as we should have agitated for)... which is to say, if
the argument is that we don't act until the u.n. is the type of
international agency we want it to be (with appropriate, and not
imbalanced, u.s. presence), we'll likely risk all manner of inequity
and injustice, as i see it... further, i *don't* think the argument
that iraq is one of many oppressive regimes that we're *not*
threatening to attack is a workable argument---i could as easily say
(and i'm not), "let's start with iraq"... and i *do* respect the more
pacifist claim that violence begets more violence, albeit i don't
personally endorse same in all contexts, as once one is past a
certain international breaking point, it seems to me that war is
inevitable (wwii the obvious example, and i won't beat that drum
anymore than it needs beating... and a parallel form of this argument
obtains at the personal level, as well)...

for the record, i also see the logic of opposing the war w/o further
ideo/logical refinement, given that we would seem to be on the brink
of same, and that my reservations about the left (as above, which are
along the lines of christopher hitchens's reservations, albeit
absent, i trust, his pugnacious form of interventionism) might be
properly muted for the sake of a united front... but if the left
can't do better, in my view, than it's been doing---publicly,
intellectually---then i'd say we'll find ourselves back on the brink
of war sooner than later (and i'm not ignorant of the ways in which
media realities give short shrift to leftist ideological platforms,
but still... e.g., a number of news commentators, e.g. chris
matthews, have come out against the war)... most petitions, emails
and calls-to-action i receive, and have been receiving, are much
better at saying what we're opposed to, political action wise, than
what we're in favor of ("we're in favor of peace" falling somewhat
short of what i have in mind)...

and i also understand, too, how the left tends to eat itself alive in
the light of public day---so please, i'm trying not to come off as
contentious here... i don't have any quick answers in line with what
i'm proposing, either---in fact, i think there are no easy "answers,"
that all remedies will be fraught at some level, and that this is one
reason why the debate as such has been so easily polarized publicly,
with bush & co simplifying matters to the point of absurdity (even as
they ruin the environment, curtail civil liberties, etc.), while
those of us who are anti-war have often appeared shrill and
reactionary in response:  content to consume as we may, presumably
entitled to enjoy a more comfy life than most of the planet (mea
culpa), but rather unable to articulate exactly what we want the govt
to *do* to prevent another 9.11...

in all, i think we can do better...

****

anyway, thanx for the opportunity to give voice to some ideas that,
to be candid, i've been sweating over lo these many months, even
while i place my phone calls to my congressional reps, etc etc etc...

best,

joe

Arielle et al -

The audio edition of Kenning (#12) is not my own but a collaborative =
editorial project with Chris Funkhouser (whose We Magazine was also duly =
mentioned).  The Kenning issue is distributed by SPD, but you could =
order it direct as well.  Ordering info available at =
www.durationpress.com/kenning - Chris is webmaster at amiribaraka.com =
and has put some sound up at that site.

I would also recommend Jackson Mac Low's CD "Open Secrets" - excerpts of =
which are available at UBU web online.  The CD accompanying the (now =
out-of-print) JML festschrift issue of CRAYON Magazine provides an =
interesting array of contemporary recordings. =20

Seems as though a syllabus might incorporate selected audio files from =
UBU Web (many historically "important" recordings there, including some =
Cage);  then the JML CD for zeroing in on a particular artist's work =
(for whom sonic registers have always played a fundamental processural =
role);  then try to locate the Crayon CD at your library and play in =
class for examples of the context stemming from and toward said artist;  =
then the Kenning CD for an example of a contemporary anthology-like mix =
(one artist therein, Edwin Torres, often associated with slamness, =
offers something "unusual" in that respect).  At some point, looking at =
the mediation of impovisation and prosody in Nate Mackey's "Song of the =
Andoumboulou" (see the STRICK CD from SPD) would be crucial.  Finally, =
you might look at the sound files of Hannah Weiner's various recordings =
of the "Clairvoyant Journal" at the EPC for the same (difference).  See =
epc.buffalo.edu/authors/weiner  - Actually, disc 2 of Kenning #12 =
provides another opportunity for sustained "close listening" vis-a-vis =
Leslie Scalapino's WAY.

This also seems as good a time as any to say that I'm working on =
producing new ("archival") sound files for inclusion with new and recent =
EPC author pages.  Expect to see new sound files regularly at the EPC - =
until I get some confirmations, I'm afraid I can't say more.  The point =
is, the range of available sounds at the EPC is deliberately growing and =
becoming a focus of my work as "contributing editor."

Arielle,


I'm sure you already know about this, but Patrick Durgin's audio issue =
of
_Kenning_ from last year seems made to order.  I have yet to purchase a =
copy
myself (guilt, guilt, guilt), but have heard some of the tracks, and =
have
seen it displayed proudly on the CD racks of many prominent, innovative, =
and

Just off the wire from cnn.com:

""Mr. Powell suffered a slip of the tongue today as he sought to clarify the
White House's objectives in Asia.

"We have no intention of invading or attacking Iraq," Mr. Powell said, when
asked by reporters at the United Nations if the United States was planning
to attack North Korea.""

It must be hard to live inside Mr. Powell these days - to discover his own
anti-war movement apparently hard at work!

As to personally justifying a "anti-war" position, to me its utterly clear
that:
1.  The drive to occupy Iraq - and that is the proposition - is a
transparent imperial/colonial mandate, in this case oil and the resource
control/ownership of its use the objective.
2. All references to liberating Iraq into a flourishing democracy and a
self-determining one are hypocritical cover for a raw power move. (Russian
and European Government opposition may be seen as a resentment among powers
who equally covet the oil. One can only imagine that coalition persuasion is
based on a promise of oil access and percentage. Blair,it would seem,
negotiated early for the best possible deal, rather than compete or differ
with the US as an ally.)
Additionally, in the US leadership, in terms of political ancestry and
history  (Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld-Negroponte-Abrams, etc.) there is nothing to
indicate a commitment to democratic values. It does not take much memory to
recollect the Central Americal role of these folks in training and
supporting the Contra-death squads and their dictator masters.
3. I cannot imagine anything but occupation leading to travesty in both
Iraq, and a series of repercussions in the Mideast and Muslim worlds. Along
with images of long term rebellion - a few American bodies a week - the
whole idea of American military forces instilling (educating) democratic
systems among cultures of which we collectively practically know nothing is
a contradiction and a self-destructive joke unto itself.   It is also mind
boggling that this country (economy in the dumps, 40 million uninsured,
etc., etc.) can even begin to picture the economic drain of imposing and
sustaining such a political and administrative structure.

This is not to say Hussein is a nice guy, or that Iraq and the Mideast
should not be a focus of constant diplomatic attention and democratic
example. Just think, if the UN were to have troops established on a line
between the Palestians and the Israelis with an insistence on negotiations,
I suspect we would move a democratic "peace" process forward (instead of
standing back and watching two people's cannibalize each other).

This obviously could go on. But this territorial opportunism is one that I
and many of us ain't going to buy. I hope Collin Powell has a long, and
heart to heart discussion with the guy inside who slipped his tongue - and
then has the courage of another kind of conviction.

Komninos,

This is a stupendous survey.  Thank you very much.  You did for the
Australian poetry scene as it shifted and developed in the 20th/21st
century thus far what I would
have liked but didn't take the time to do for the Irish equivalent, when
I was writing my post.  Thank you very, very much.  Also, thank you for
the term "soundings," which is new to me in the context of poetry
readings, though, if there is any other listmember out there
of the same vintage as myself and schooled in Ireland, you might
remember a Leaving Certificate poetry anthology called .... Soundings!
Thanks also to Komninos, Brian, and Murat, for helpful strategies on
workshopless poetry writing seminars.

here's an australian spin on mairead's post.

i feel this list is very america-centric in its thinking, perhaps not
intentially, but one gets the feeling that the list in general equates
poetry with poetry that happens in the usa. but poetry does happen in
other
places in the world, and even if we are far away and small in population
i
assure you that there is a poetic culture in australia and issues that
are
similar to the american experience.

as a professional performance poet for ten years, and as a person with a

science education, and as a person who did not study literature from
books
at university, but rather developed my aesthetic in the pubs and coffee
lounges of melbourne and sydney, i would like to comment on the
community
or local poetry as compared/intertwingled with the academic treatment of

poetry.

before contact with the melbourne performance poetry scene i thought i
was
the only person in the world expressing themselves through poetry, my
work
resembled song lyric, in metre and rhyme because that was my concept of
poetry from school, but also because people like bob dylan were my idea
of
modern poets. the poetry readings introduced me to index poetry, to
humorous poetry, to political poetry, to non-rhyming poetry, to personal

poetry, to conversational poetry, to sound poetry, to shouting poetry to

whispering poetry. i was learning the theory through practice, the
sounding, the local activity also being a sharing, so the influences of
the
surrealists, the dadaists, the beats, the black mountain poets, the new
york school poets, the lang-pos were brought to soundings by the various

poets in their poems and i incorporated in my own writing without
consciously studying them. the territory the poetry mapped was also
expanded as i left my self as object and subject of my poetry and looked

further afield.


i appreciate the importance of the local activity of poetry, the poetry
sounding(reading). this aspect of poetic culture has been trivialised or

marginalised over the last 50 years; for political reasons during the
50s,
60s and 70s (mccarthy anti-communist period, cold war, and vietnam where

poetry readings were seen as subversive left-wing activities);
for  cultural elitist reasons (seen as 'low' or 'popular' culture); or
for
commercial reasons (published books being more traditionally marketable
items). this was at the same time that english publishers were opening
australian divisions and publishing australian poetry lists and the time

that australian literature was being introduced into the university
curriculum, the establishment of the university presses, and a fairly
conservative establishment of academics and book publishers were
developing
a canon which rooted the australian tradition back to england via oxford

university and shakespeare, and far from the bush ballad and
'australianist' poetry of the first half of the 19th century in
australia.
this establishment resisted the influences of theory and praxis outside
of
england. it wasn't until the 70s and 80s did we start to see the
influence
of american new criticism and influences of movements like the beats,
the
projectivists, the new york school and the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets, and
the
influence of french theorists on the poetic discourse of australia. in
the
70s poetry readings became very important to the culture, an important
part
of anti-vietnam , feminist, lifestyle experimentation, gays and
lesbians,
idigenous and ethnic group activities. they were also focal points for
publishing ventures and the emergence in the late 70s and early 80s of
the
small independent presses(sometimes called the mimeograph publishers
because they were cheaply printed and hand collated and bound).  the
anglo-centric view of australian culture and literary canon was being
challenged at the community level and at the academic level with
younger,
better informed, culturally representative academics keen to establish
australian poetry amongst the english-language poetries of the world and

with a more pluralistic view of the poetics and aesthetics of poetry and
in
deed writing in general.

unlike the usa, which has had creative writing programs at universities
(since 1922 i believe, iowa?) the conservative au universities resisted
creative writing programs in the 70s, but they were introduced through
community pressure, into colleges of advanced education (teacher
training)
and tertiary institutes of technology. strangely enough the
autobiographical or workshop nature of the usa writing programs was
often
cited as a reason not to introduce writing programs into universities.
many
writers who didn't have university educations in literature or writing
found teaching these courses to be a valuable means of earning a living
as
writers. again the sounding or reading in public was a very important
part
of the writing programs.
in the 80s the labor government of australia implemented a higher
education
'rationalization' which aimed to reduce duplication and increase
efficiency. this saw the merging of colleges of education, institutes of

technology and universities into multi-campus conglomerates, and a much
wider offering of courses. writing programs were now an officially
recognized part of university studies. this has  been good in one way,
but
in another way has meant the writing programs and teachers of writing
have
had to conform to the more conservative academic standards, more
emphasis
on print publication, more pressure to publish, more pressure for more
officially qualified teachers (phds). the 80s also saw the emergence of
a
new poetic industry, that of professional performance poet. many poets,
like myself, began to earn a living by performing their work outside of
the
traditional literary venues of university or community seminar rooms and

more at music venues, comedy venues, schools, community groups, prisons,

literary festivals. the 80s was also a time when the states (victoria,
new
south wales, queensland, western australia) introduced annual arts
festivals that included a 'writers' week' modeled on the successful
adelaide festival writers' week established in 1960. however the
festivals
are more like book readers' and publishers' festivals even though they
are
all called writers' festivals. the sponsored writers being the writers
the
publishers are promoting at the moment. whilst soundings (readings) are
a
major part and most popular of these events, the performance poets and
open
poetry readings are usually relegated to fringe status. the community
organized poetry festivals, montsalvat, the queensland poetry festival,
the
tasmanian poetry festival and the nsw poets' union are more writer
intensive and offer a greater variety of performance poetry.  by the way

for all those slamericans who want to lay claim for inventing
competitive
poetry events, the launceston poetry cup has been a yearly event since
1984, one minute poem, audience response as judge.

but generally by the 90s the public reading/performance of poetry and
the
teaching of writing were accepted as more mainstream activities, and
seen
as a part of our poetic culture.

since 1995 the commercial publication by major publishers is in decline
as
the market for poetry on a national level has shrunk to below one of
economic viability. the reasons that the audience for published poetry
has
decreased may be many, and i don't have any evidence, but i believe the
publication of theoretically informed experiments in poetry by
academically
educated teachers and students in the late 80s and early 90s may have
alienated a part of the readership of poetry unfamiliar with poetic and
aesthetic contemporary discourses. but that does not mean that the
overall
publication of poetry has decreased. quite the opposite. according to
national literature database figures there has been a steady increase
since
a slight dip in 1995, with over 450 poetry titles published per year.
these
publications are self-funded or from regional presses, and some
subsidized
university presses. the local activity of the sounding (reading) is of
great importance here in the promotion and sale and distribution of the
published product.

there is an active network of venues for weekly poetry sounding in each
capital city of australia and in the regional cities as well.
performance
poets can make a living but have to be prepared to travel -"have poem -
will travel" (pun on 'have gun - will travel' trashy 60s tv cowboy
show).
schools are great sources of income for a poet too, teachers and
librarians
keen to excite their students about contemporary language and its uses,
often invite performance poets to 'turn their children on' to poetry. i
always felt the greatest thing i could do when i went to a school was to

change the students' concept of what a poem looked like on a page, what
it
sounded like, what a poem could say, and how it could say it, so that it

was more relevant to their lives. i did not intend to make all students
great poets but at least convince them to not put up a barrier to poetry

because they thought it was too old fashioned and irrelevant to their
lives. if any of them were inspired my belief was that once they fell in

love with the form then they would be encouraged to study the more
formal
aspects of history and analysis.

i am now a tenured academic, i first taught university as a sessional
lecturer(adjunct?) in writing programs in nsw and queensland (1991 -
1999).
when i began teaching i began reading a lot more about australian poetry

and other poetries in english, i began to better contextualize what i
had
been doing as a performance poet, i began to ask questions about my
craft
and the theories of literature and life that inform it. i realized how
fortunate students in writing programs were to be studying their chosen
art
form in a nurturing environment informed by experience of those that
have
been actively involved in the australian poetic culture, and being
encouraged to perform their work in public as well as seeking
publication.

Another area of growth for poets in australia and globally has been the
world wide web, an exciting new form of publication and distribution,
and
more so a great new tool for creation. griffith university was quick to
recognize the importance of this new writing space and in 1998 i wrote
and
taught 'writing for the web' to writing program students to introduce
them
to html and the creative use of the web. in the following year the
cyberstudies major was introduced as a specialist major for bachelor of
arts students.

well to finish and summarize, i believe writing programs are good but
should not be elevated or separated from their local or community
activity.
and that teaching performance and digital poetry is just as important as

teaching writing about, and for, print publication.

I just want to place a few points here.
This is an adminstration mainly made of people from the Reagan/Bush
administrations; that is, people from the last century, who are, deep in
their minds, still fighting the Cold War. So that their policies--economic,
environmental, etc., it's all connected--don't make any sense in the world
as it is now. But they plow ahead like a dog with a bone in its jaws, no
matter what public opinion may say. This is what makes them dangerous to a
democracy. Unlike Clinton, who read the polls, and changed course, these
people are ideologists.

It all got off on the wrong foot, remember? George Bush didn't win the
election, he was appointed by a split Supreme Court. Some of the judges who
voted to stop the count in Florida were appointed by his father, just as
judges now ruling on other issues in favor of the administration were. So
that just the move toward another war, a war within a war, like Chinese
boxes, is a superficial reading of the forces involved. It would take a team
of psychologists and anthropologists to get at this, as it's rooted in
lockstepped minds--neurotic, that is--, and a family named Bush.

check out Jaap Blonk, the dutch sound poet. he's got a website where
you can sample his stuff and a bunch of cds out.  also, in the early
90s WNYC-tv ran a series of poetry spots, including Paul Beatty,
Tracie Morris and Walter Lew poems v nicely videotaped.  i was able
to get a tape w/ those three on it just by writing to WNYC and asking
for them.  some specific spots on the United States of Poetry, for
instance Tracie Morris, Carla Harryman, Amiri Baraka, Wanda Coleman,
etc are well worth showing.  you'd have to be selective.  and refer
your students to ubuweb --there's lots of fun stuff on there.

Is it surprising that poets who choose academic careers would express disdain for so-called "romantic" ideas of artistic vocation?

Creative Writing answers to the old middle-class anxiety about having a proper profession.  Your parents may think your "poems" are meaningless, but at least they can be proud that you teach at a State University ("Look, our boy the Professor!").  You yourself may know that your gift is, as they say, minor, but at least you can console your ego with the trappings of professional achievement.  When the businessman on the plane, noting your artsy eyeglass frames and your Pelikan pen, asks you why you're flying to Baltimore, you'll get a double blessing of prestige: he'll see you as a professional like himself, and also as an artist, an identity to which he (unlike you) still grants a special status -- call it "cool."

But hey, no one blames you for being heavily invested in an image of professional achievement, especially given the current trend of downward mobility among the highly educated.  You don't want to wind up like, say, the Mac guy at Microcenter, pissing your time away for $7/hour.  And why should just the corporate types be able to buy houses?  Don't you deserve it as much as they do?  Besides, your spouse/partner stuck with you all those years in grad school: doesn't he/she deserve something better?  What about starting a family?

If you need other ways to rationalize your careerism, the AWP is certainly willing to furnish them.  Think of yourself as a mentor to future generations!

Of course academic professionalism (or, let's say, the strained, bad faith, cracks-showing-through simulation of professionalism) doesn't come free.  It exacts conformity to the rules of the game, such as compulsory comity among your fellow careerists.  The preservation of everyone's status depends on mutual affirmation, on plurality and tolerance and positive attitudes (you've been practicing that demeanor since your first writing workshop).  And if no one must be allowed to criticize anyone else, then neither may anyone aspire to anything more than mere professionalism.  "Oh come on, that whole poet-rebel trip is like _so_ 1950s.  Don't you know that that's just a way to sell cars now?"  (Nietzsche: "'We have invented happiness', say the last men, and they blink.")

But, really, whether or not you follow this academic career path toward the kind of everyday American nihilism that leaves people nothing to aspire to but having enough money to retire on, the more important consideration is ~precisely~ poetry's lack of cool, because cool -- the mysterious aura around the poem or song that makes sensitive teenagers want to be the makers of such things -- is what keeps an art vigorous and changing.

Nor, I think, is the alternative to professionalism some kind of "stupid underground" (Paul Mann's phrase http://www.iath.virginia.edu/pmc/text-only/issue.595/mann.595).  Rather, I think the idea is to refuse, to the degree that one can, all preexisting ideas of what it means to be a writer or poet.

no offense, andrew, but this sounds like so much sour grapes (and no, i'm
not an "academic" -- farthest thing from it. don't even have an m.a.)

i'm tired of all this bitching about academic careerists vs. "real" poets
and vice versa. it's like jocks picking on people in marching band or
"conservative christians" attacking gays. if it really repulses you so much,
why obsess on it so? is there something underneath all that, jealosy,
wishful thinking, etc?

most of all, this sort of generalized, "addressed to no one" rant does
nothing to further any sort of dialogue that might exist. i know so-called
"academic" poets who really are passionate about what they do and dedicated
to immersing themselves in the full range of poetic discourse available,
i.e. slams "beat" readings street jive jazz whatever, not just esoteric
school-sponsored readings (not to mention that they're passionate about
teaching Poetry); conversely i know plenty of posers who hide behind their
street credentials and do nothing to broaden their own knowledge, contribute
nothing, simply suck energy out of the scene. it's a drag, man.

as for "cool" -- gimme a break. what's cool? who defines it? cool didn't
make me want to be a poet and cool ain't paying my bills. if you're talking
about "duende" (uh-oh -- there's that word again), the "mysterious aura"
around a poem, just sucking down cigs and reading Nietzsche at the cappucino
bar ain't gonna give it to you, either.

Like the brave and logical Mairead (wasn't it? forgive me -- the latest
wrinkle in my mother's cancer is either mini-stroke or brain tumor; we
find out which tomorrow), I will simply say:

I went to an MFA program. It was fun. I met other people who cared as
much as I did about poetry and language and such. I got to be in Poetry
Theater a couple of years running. I met visitors like Susan Howe --
that was rather transformative. I got help. I got ego strokes. I diddled
about with book arts. I got some litmag-editing experience.

Am I in debt? Yep. Was it a waste of time and money? Nope. The program
was sufficiently academically rigorous to challenge me -- and my
preconceived notions. Are AWP frequently a bunch of bozos? Damn skippy;
I used to work there. Have I become permanently academified? Possibly. I
should awfully like to get a PhD, but either I must first win the
lottery, or global warming must radically improve the climate of Buffalo.

I liked it. You might not have. YMMV.

Thanks to Gwyn & Mairead & others for the posts on mfa, etc.

 From another perspective, I've stayed out of the MFA programs, I've damned
them and been confounded by them, yet can say that sometimes the careerism
(and I know that's not the only thing there) doesn't seem like such a bad
idea, from the point of view of someone like me with two children to feed &
raise, wondering how they will get by, go to college, etc. Yet I'm not
sorry about my choices.

Also, whatever I have to say, and some of it is sometimes nasty, about MFA
programs, and specifically the one that most impacts on local culture and
poets, here in Tucson, Arizona, I also absolutely thank it for bringing
some of Chax Press's best friends and biggest supporters here over the
years, going back to when I first came here and began Chax in 1984. To name
names, Lisa Cooper, Mike Magoolaghan, Roger Hecht, Karen Falkenstrom,
Allison Moore, Jesse Seldess, Tim Peterson, Heather Nagami, and a few
others, have been essential & enabling to Chax's, & my, existence here. And
while I may (and sometimes do) cry out that they are the exceptions here,
the rebels within that all-too-nonrebellious mfa program, I also know that
they came here because of that program, and I am thankful for that.

And I am entirely surprised at myself, here in this gap during a time of
cooking dinner for family -- that here I am defending, in a way, mfa
programs & their denizens, or at least several of their denizens.

Can anyone help me with this question  -  needed for  an a very
un-earth-shattering footnote:

Where is Emmanuel Leutze's "Washington Crossing The Delaware"
situated?  I need a gallery or museum name & the city or state.

It's the picture Larry Rivers parodied in his own painting of the same name.

Interview between John Anthony Thwaites and Gerhard Richter
written by Sigmar Polke,  October 1964

Mr Richter, you are the most talented of the German Pop
painters; you went through all the hardships and the
hostility that the movement encountered in its early days;
and you now occupy a leading position in the movement.
Perhaps you can tell us something about your work and your
artistic development.

I have a lot of work, and I am well developed artistically,
and also mentally and physically. I pull the expander front
and back. And if you  saw my new pictures, Mr Thwaites, you
would collapse!

       Why?

Because they're so good!  You've never seen such good
pictures in your  life. No one has ever seen such good
pictures, and I can't show them to anyone, because everyone
would collapse. So in the first place I hung cloths over all
the pictures, and then in due course I overpainted them all
white.

    And now?

Now I don't paint at all any more, because I don't want to
have the whole human race on my conscience.

    How many victims have your works accounted for?

I don't know, exactly.  The exact statistics do exist, of
course - they run into the tens of thousands - but I can't
concern myself with trivia. It was more interesting earlier
on, when the big death camps in Eastern Europe were using my
pictures. The inmates used to drop dead at first sight.
Those were still the simple pictures, too. Anyone who
survived the first show was killed off by a slightly better
picture.

    And your drawings?

I haven't done a lot. Buchenwald and Dachau had two each,
and Bergen-Belsen had one. Those were mostly used for
torture purposes.

    The Russians are said to have five of your paintings and
drawings.  Is that so?

I don't know how many.

     Stalin mounted his reign of terror with two pictures.
After killing millions of russians, it's said that he caught
an accidental glimpse of one of your pictures, just for a
fraction of a second, and immediately dropped down dead. -Is
that so?

I don't know. One of my best paintings is in the Soviet
Union.


   So what happens next?

I don't paint any more. I can't, because I don't want to
spread terror, alarm and anxiety everywhere, and depopulate
the earth. But now it's come to the point where I only have
to think my paintings out and tell someone about them, and
the person rushes off in a state of panic, has a nervous
breakdown, and becomes infertile. That is the worst effect.
Though I can't say so for sure, as yet, because - depending
on who tells the story - I have already caused dumbness,
hair loss (mainly in women) and paralysis of limbs.


    Is it true that you supply paintings to the US Army?

I can't tell you anything about that.

    Have you no scruples, or anything?

I am an artist.

   Do you believe in God?

Yes, I believe in myself, I am the greatest, I am the
greatest of all!

   Thank you, Mr Richter.

Not at all, Mr Thwaites.

Can anyone help me with this question  -  needed for  an a very
un-earth-shattering footnote:

Where is Emmanuel Leutze's "Washington Crossing The Delaware"
situated?  I need a gallery or museum name & the city or state.

It's the picture Larry Rivers parodied in his own painting of the same name.

what's wrong with the ubu audio archives, or the factory school's archive,
in fact why don't your students do a web research for these items?
john giorno has produced some great videos as well - 'gang of souls',
'whatever happened to jack krouac' etc. and from england, ten years in an
open necked shirt, featururing john cooper clarke, attila the stockbroker,
seething wells etc. circa 1981. from australia the 'sbs book show poets'
(1994) is also a good documentary of australian poets spanning three
decades, 1960s to 1990s. there is also a video called louder than words
featuring jas h duke, ania walwicz and eric beach, circs1985.
and i agrree with geoffrey 'poetry in motion' is also very good.

I havent been following this thread closely but no one, (I believe) has
mentioned the amazing bp Nichol video 'pushing the boundaries' with
ghost appearances of jw curry as the letterman... distributed by Coach
House.  for someone  like me who had always intended to witness Nichol
in person it brings one about as close as you can get to experiencing
visually & auditorially all that he was.  There are of course a number
of cassette tapes of him & the 4 horseman around as well.

Some other writers and I are currently working on a set of
collaborative short fictions (2 to 3 pages each) that describe responses
of a "university community" to reports of an " on-campus orgy."  We work
from assigned random lines in other texts and these assigned random lines
are also present in others' fictions as well.  Fictions themselves can be
from the viewpoint of any created character and can carry the storyline
anywhere you choose.  Anyone interested?  If so, please backchannel to
gcycho1@uic.edu.  Thanks.

What is a good poem?  I got this response from someone in the middle of
UScentralia who suffers from a chronic health problem and likely has not
been in an MFA program:
"expressiveness of
thoughts, actions, emotions
a poem is dynamic and not static
it is lyrical grace
always taking on new meaning
while having a meaning of its own"

I like it even though somewhat romantic.

i thot gang of souls was v corny...fun and sentimental, yes, but not
what one thinks of when one thinks "avant-garde" --it's more a
celebration via famous hip/beat talking heads, of "beat."  not much
by way of performances, etc.

I'm simply pasisng this on to folks I think ought to send something. I have
no idea how Todd will edit this collection down to 100 poems. There were
close to 400-500,000 people in the march with me in DC on Saturday where
the temp never got above 24 degrees. Everybody there could have written a
poem.

Timed to coincide with the Hans Blix report on January 27th - a possible
trigger for an unacceptable war against the Iraqi people - 100 POETS
AGAINST WAR (working title) will be released globally, as a PDF file
available for download at a number of sympathetic web-sites to be named on
the day.

Please feel free to suggest an even better title in your reply (see below)
and the "best" may end up being used instead of the admittedly rather
generic one on offer at the moment (this is a fast-paced event).

The PDF format will be designed so that any one who downloads the file will
be able to print off copies, and, by simply folding and stapling, produce
potentially unlimited numbers of the chapbook for free distribution
throughout the world.  It will be designed for maximum dissemination,
though an attempt will be made to make the font, cover and design look
"good".

All poets in the anthology will be asked to submit new, unpublished work,
on the anti-war theme, which they will be asked to donate.  Copyright will
remain with the poets.

The editor of the collection is Todd Swift (www.toddswift.com) who is
co-editor of the recent global anthology of contemporary poetry, Short
Fuse, as well as poetry editor of London-based www.nthposition.com.  He
will be seeking co-operative support from poets and editors world-wide.

If you receive this email, you are being asked to submit a poem.

All poets, please send one poem only, with a brief contributor's note, to
the following email address no later than Friday, January 24, 2003:
todd@toddswift.com .  Please mark in the subject line 100 poets against war
and your name.

In order to create a product of lasting literary as well as activist value,
please forward this email to poets of serious professional standing in your
community (that is poets who have been published in journals or book form
or who have a CD or other multimedia release).  No poet or poem will be
turned away unless the poems use language which could be seen as hateful
against any race or creed or group, though satire is welcome; or if the
editor is unable to fit them all into this DIY format (that is we are
aiming for a hundred poems by this Friday); or if they are deemed very
incompatible with the general spirit of the anthology (in terms of theme or
content).

Poems should be no more than 30 lines in length (we are aiming to have one
poem per page), should be titled, and must not be anonymous.  The editor
apologises in advance for applying any limits to the work at all.  Within
the constraints mentioned above, an exciting body of powerful and socially
significant work should be available for distribution throughout the world
within a week.

Thank you for your support.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- JANUARY 2003

Slought Networks Exhibition:
January 22, 2003 - March 22, 2003

Free Reception: Wednesday, January 22, 2003,
6:30 - 8:30 PM


"Cities without citizens: statelessness and intimacy
in contemporary art and architecture"

http://slought.net/toc/calendar/display.php?id=1135

This two-part exhibition explores the figure of the stranger in
contemporary art, architecture, and cultural life. Works respond to
apocalypse in the modern sense, simply making the world uninhabitable,
generic. Exhibition curated by Aaron Levy.

Gans & Jelacic's Extreme Housing ameliorates living conditions for those
persons permanently if internally displaced from the economic and
geopolitical order. Lars Wallsten's Pictures of crime catalogues the
violence that empties out the city, marking the dissolution of the
public and private. Katrin Sigurdardottir's Untitled suspends the urban
landscape in water, producing uninhabitable landscapes at once desirable
and desolate. Aaron Levy's Kloster Indersdorf series revisits an
orphanage in 1945 and recasts the photographic address as a signifier of
abandonment. Gregg Lambert's Of Strangers: Notes on statelessness
reexamines continental philosophy and public culture through the figure
of the stranger. Information, artist biographies and curatorial
statement online: http://slought.net/


Works include:
Gans & Jelacic, Architecture and Design: Extreme Housing
Lars Wallsten: Pictures of crime
Katrin Sigurdardottir: Untitled, 2001-2003
Aaron Levy: Search String: Kloster Indersdorf
Gregg Lambert: Of Strangers: Notes on statelessness and intimacy

The second iteration will take place at The Rosenbach Museum & Library
from July to September, 2003.

Slought Networks emphasizes innovative curatorial and artistic practices
through events, exhibitions and publications.

I appreciated Alex Young's suggestion to write a paragraph or two about the
George Bush push for war against Iraq. The responses on this list to Alex's
challenge were thought provoking and useful to me in every case. The
dialogic nature of this list, particularly since 9/11, is changing the way I
think about writing and reading.

  Pro-war people frequently remind us about 9/11 and claim pacifists have a
short memory. As some of you might remember Barrett Watten,  Ron Silliman
and many others had an extended discussion about the aftermath of the 9/11
attacks here on the list, some of which was republished along with many
other useful writings on Barrett Watten's web site Crisis/America. My
dialogue with Barrett was reprinted in Chain 9 along with our "updates."
This is also available on Chain's web site. As it turns out, I am now much
closer to Barrett's position about the immediate and long term importance of
anti-war actions and building a solid anti-war movement. At the time I
predicted that I would eventually feel this way. I knew this because of my
anti- war experiences of the 60's. One benefit of being so involved with
psychotherapy is that I am no longer very uncomfortable with being
ambivalent. I've written about this on the list before. I feel that learning
to tolerate ambivalence is very useful because it helps guard against
knee-jerk or impulsive, unthought out stances. On the other hand, there
comes a time to take a stand. Although I am sympathetic with the ousting of
Saddam Hussein, especially after a careful and fascinated reading of
"Saddam's Bombmaker: The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and
Biological
> Weapons Agenda", Khidr Abd Al-Abbas Hamzah, Jeff Stein>
I am not supportive of the impending invasion of Iraq. My essential reason
for this is the prospect of the unavoidable loss of so many lives on both
sides in a land war. I am also very concerned that this action will vastly
increase the amount of terrorism throughout the world by intensifying
anti-American and anti-British sentiment. Republicans love short-term
solutions. What we need is more understanding of, plans and actions towards
long term solutions: on terrorism, the environment, the economy, racism,
poverty, healthcare, employment, aids, gay and feminist and many other
issues. People who are mainly interested in money rarely think long term,
even about money. Long term thinking is less emotional, and is more
satisfied with gradual, small gains, which frequently show increasing
momentum over time.  But a focus on long term solutions must include
toleration of considerable anxiety, something Republicans know little about,
except for the few with physical courage under fire like the John McCain
types. But this type of courage is somewhat different from learning to
tolerate ambivalence and long term anxiety based on widespread ongoing human
needs and dilemmas.  For the same reasons the Republicans are against
insurance companies covering long term psychotherapy they are mostly opposed
to working for long term solutions to all the endemic, frequently worldwide
social problems. This country has become obsessed with instantaneity. In
becoming the slaves of our machines, our gasoline, our craving for comfort
and ease, our instant amusements, as a nation we growing more like machines:
unfeeling, unempathic, automatic, remorseless, aggressive. The difference
between people and machines is that people need time: time to heal, time to
learn, to grow, to change. The challenge for thinking people is to shift
attention about social issues away from Republican style defensive,
arrogant, racist, capital oriented short term thinking towards a team player
approach where people desire and need to work together towards mutually
beneficial long term goals. War will not take us in this direction, although
we do need to find effective ways to stand up to and stop vicious tyrants
like Saddam Hussein. Yet this will not happen by supporting the vicious,
violent, racist aspects of our own government and nation. We don't need
delusional thinking in our leaders and our government. Last night I heard
the comic Rich Jeni say on Comedy Central "a religious war is a battle
between whose imaginary friend is better."

Just saw on Atlanta news, news of a pizza shop owner in midtown who
committed suicide...he moved here from NYC in the 70's and always
put politically/morally conscious messages on his pizza shop sign, and
would let the homeless eat free when they came 'round.
He left two grown kids, and the shop, and a lot of sad customers...I
know someone who waitressed there in high school...it was a great
place, and apparently he was a great man...just makes you realize that
a lot of people are dealing w/ heaving changes now, and how precious
life is and telling the ones you love how much they mean to you IS very
important.

"the antiquated meaning-based continuum"



the extemporizing ~moderne~ facade
actually has a sort of problem

it's the strangest experience

(i tend toward flirting myself)

for example

"the crack of a woman's ass"

_ / _ / _ /

"the hirsute crack of a woman's ass"

_ / _ \ _ / ( _ )

OR

a very neatly trimmed bush

(standard A-B-A-B sort of meter)


Of course, I could see why a
print-publishable
21st century poet

would hyphenate

"over-sized clitoris"

and now
we
begin to sway
Back and forth

Back
  and
    forth

u n t i l ---

 / _ _ / _ _ / _ _ /


then,
afterwards

comes an unsolicited penny-for-your-thoughts

Of course, that's the unresolved question
for all of
us

SMALL PRESS TRAFFI''S
POETS? THEATER JAMBOREE 2003
BEGINS THIS FRIDAY

Please join us for four wondrous & bizarre evenings of poets' theater!
Reservations are recommended. Please call 415-551-9278 to make yours. As the
Jamboree is a benefit for SPT, admission is $10 per night for everyone. This
year's jamboree is curated by Taylor Brady, Brent Cunningham, Elizabeth
Treadwell Jackson, & Kevin Killian.

Friday, January 24, & again Saturday, January 25, 2003 at 7:30 PM

Cecilia Dougherty, "Kevin and Cedar" (2002, world premiere). In this
revealing portrait of San Francisco bohemia, Kevin Killian and Cedar Sigo
play themselves as Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud, trapped in a
destructive affair in an untidy SOMA apartment, surrounded by debris and
the flickering madness of their own poems. Video, 8 minutes, 10 seconds.

Karla Milosevich and Kevin Killian, "Love Can Build a Bridge." It?s
another sleepy dusty delta day in Marfa, Texas, the site of the famous
mystery lights and the home of Donald Judd?s art farm in West Texas. The
great American minimalist has died, and his survivors gather together to
hear his will read in the town?s one bar, Roy?s Cotton Club. This exciting
tale of conceptual art, country music, long-ago feuds and present-day
shamanism gathers together an eccentric cast of artists, poets, filmmakers and
painters, including Laurie Reid, Jocelyn Saidenberg, Bob Linder, Kota Ezawa,
Yedda Morrison, George Kuchar, Cliff Hengst, Anne McGuire, Scott Hewicker,
Craig Goodman, Gerald Corbin, Wendy Kramer, Rex Ray, & Wayne Smith.

Andrew, i don't know who you are, but i have to admit that i used to bitch about these same things until friends of mine started going for their MFAs, or meeting new friends with MFAs.  with me it was always a class issue, no one in my family having ever gone to college.

before i go any further i wanted to THANK YOU for your post.  and add that i don't believe it's sour grapes.  sour grapes is such an EASY finger-pointing game, and often, if you get close enough to the finger you can smell the asshole it's been shoved inside.

frankly, living in Philadelphia, i MUST admit how influential the Temple MFA program has been on the city's poetry community.  a positive influence with guest lectures and readings open to the public i wouldn't get to see otherwise, not to mention all the poets moving here, living here for the program.  this amazing poetry list is a perfect example of what MFA programs have to give to all of us.

i have met plenty of poets with MFAs who have changed my earlier views.  but i still don't want to have one myself, because i hate school, hate loans, hate plenty of other things too if i get a list going.

must also admit however that a couple of friends were RUINED by creative writing MFAs, poets i admired, poets i really felt had something going.  poets who came to me and others and asked what we thought about them going into the programs and i DID support their decision, not wanting to live someone's life for them.  but later, i wished i had said NO!  there are poets who get into these programs and NEVER write poetry again.

that makes me a little angry, that it destroys a few.  because i can't imagine that anyone wouldn't go into such a program unless they absolutely LOVED poetry.  someone told me that Norman Mailer was asked once how he felt about writing programs destroying some young writers, and his answer was, "they don't destroy enough of them if you ask me."  so there are bullies like Mailer with those opinions.  will that asshole EVER get into therapy i want to ask?

but still, it seems most of the poets i meet have had a positive experience with MFA programs.  oh well, guess it's as gray as anything.

Your parents may think your "poems" are meaningless, but at least they can be proud that you teach at a State University ("Look, our boy the Professor!").   You yourself may know that your gift is, as they say, minor, but at least you can console your ego with the trappings of professional achievement.  When the businessman on the plane, noting your artsy eyeglass frames and your Pelikan pen, asks you why you're flying to Baltimore, you'll get a double blessing of prestige: he'll see you as a professional like himself, and also as an artist, an identity to which he (unlike you) still grants a special status -- call it "cool."

You don't want to wind up like, say, the Mac guy at Microcenter, pissing your time away for $7/hour.   And why should just the corporate types be able to buy houses?  Don't you deserve it as much as they do?  Besides, your spouse/partner stuck with you all those years in grad school: doesn't he/she deserve something better?  What about starting a family?

It exacts conformity to the rules of the game, such as compulsory comity among your fellow careerists.   The preservation of everyone's status depends on mutual affirmation, on plurality and tolerance and positive attitudes (you've been practicing that demeanor since your first writing workshop).  And if no one must be allowed to criticize anyone else, then neither may anyone aspire to anything more than mere professionalism.   "Oh come on, that whole poet-rebel trip is like _so_ 1950s.  Don't you know that that's just a way to sell cars now?"  (Nietzsche: "'We have invented happiness', say the last men, and they blink.")

Rather, I think the idea is to refuse, to the degree that one can, all preexisting ideas of what it means to be a writer or poet.

<Is it surprising that poets who choose academic careers would
express disdain for so-called "romantic" ideas of artistic vocation?>

I Reply:

I wasn't aware that, en masse, they did. I suppose we could take a
poll. As to whether it would be surprising or not, I suppose it would
be no more or less surprising than if they would applaud those so-
called "romantic" notions. Poets tend to disagree. But you already
know that.

displacement, tale without teller." Retold on this tape by the author

Mailer's nasty and brutish (and short), but still, one must
admit that the dark side of the MFA universe is similar to
that of the PhD and (especially!) the MA: the economic
viability of said programs too typically depends on a
marketing strategy that encourages the young and
impressionable to believe that you, too, have what it takes
to make the pros if you can copy this drawing of a turtle.
Follow the money. Almost nobody gets financial aid to
pursue an MFA or an MA in English, correct? How do all
us PhDs get our funding?

More selectivity in graduate humanities programs would
ensure that those who do make it in have a much greater
chance of career success. It's probably way too easy to get
into graduate school these days. That makes all kinds of
sense for departments and administrations -- cheap
teaching, tuition income, prestige of a large program --
but does a serious disservice to many of the folks who
would seem to be the beneficiaries.

The only solution to this problem, it seems to me, is the absolute boycott by
everybody to become adjuncts. Then the universities will be forced to build
real factulties. Of course, that requires by almost a whole generation of
ph.d's to fall on the sword.

Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2003 06:05:02 -0500

Hey, sister cities!

You may have heard the great news by now that
Philadelphia~born master bassist Henry Grimes, who'd
been missing from the music world ever since the late
'6O's, had been found in good health (though pretty much
destitute) living in a single~room occupancy hotel in
South Central Los Angeles.  He's been living in the
same room for the last 2O years but had long ago
sold his bass for survival needs & has since contented
himself with writing poetry, trying a bit of acting,
doing odd jobs, & surviving on Social Security.  The
person who found Henry Grimes is a wonderful young
social worker & writer named Marshall Marrotte, who
himself lives in Athens, Georgia.

When Marshall Marrotte found Henry Grimes, Henry told
him that he very much wished he had a bass so he could
start playing again.  Here we have a supreme master
musician who went to Juilliard, who recorded & played
brilliantly with musicians as diverse as Albert Ayler, Don
Cherry, Benny Goodman, Roy Haynes, Lee Konitz, Steve
Lacy, Charles Mingus (yes, Charles Mingus), Sunny Murray,
Perry Robinson, Sonny Rollins, Pharoah Sanders, Archie
Shepp, Cecil Taylor, Charles Tyler, McCoy Tyner, Rev.
Frank Wright, & many more.

For me, a planet where the great Henry Grimes does not
have a bass is not a place I want to be, & being unprepared
for space travel at this time, I took it upon myself to stay
here & begin a month~long nationwide search for a bass
for Henry Grimes.  I wrote to, called, or otherwise contacted
about 5O of the musicians Henry played & recorded with
before he disappeared, as well as many bassists in good
standing today who would know him as a music hero, even
if he was before their time.  I put particular concentration
on the West Coast because shipping a bass is a big
expense in itself, & I also thought the Western music
community would want the opportunity to gather around
him, & I thought it would be easy especially for those
connected with academia or major cultural institutions
out West to hook him up with practice space & an
instrument to play, at the very least.  So with Marshall
Marrotte's approval, I put the word out far & wide, & then
we waited for offers of a bass for Henry Grimes.

For quite a while, nobody moved.

Slowly a few people began to say they'd be willing to
do something ~ make a donation, hold or play in a
benefit concert, contribute a bow  ~ kind, good offers,
but not a bass for Henry Grimes to play.  A couple of
afflicted souls responded negatively, cynically or with
hostility.  Most just didn't answer at all.

Then, just when I was beginning to despair ~ just when
I began to question my lifelong belief in the term "music
community" as something more than a concept or
an ideal, but as an actual living entity that embraces
& sustains its own ~  the great William Parker came home
to New York City from another of his tours, took a couple
of days to relax, began to read his accumulated Emails,
& called me up to say he would send a bass & a bow
to Henry Grimes.  First he wanted New York's great bass
specialist David Gage to make a small repair, & then
David's shop would build a shipping crate for the bass
& arrange & pay for the shipping.  One of David Gage's
employees, a bassist called Sprocket, even put up $1OO
of his own money to help with shipping costs, while
Wendy Oxenhorn of New York's Jazz Foundation stood
prepared to cover shipping if needed, & was happy to learn
she could keep that money to help another musician in
need.

Henry Grimes received the bass William Parker named
Olive Oil (more, I think, due to the greenish tinge of her
finish than for Popeye's girlfriend) on December 16th,
2OO2, & we've been in touch with Henry, & he is ecstatic
to have Olive Oil & has been practicing happily ever since.
In fact, he recently was heard to wish for a pickup & an
amp so he can go out to play, & the building manager
reports that if someone knocks on Henry Grimes's
door, he's been too engrossed in playing the bass to
respond.

This leads me back to those offers of donations &
benefit concerts & such.  For all those who wish to
help Henry Grimes on his road back into the music,
here are some suggestions:

(1) If you were a close friend, band mate, or family member
of Henry Grimes, please contact me or Marshall Marrotte
& we will give you Henry's address (subject to prior
agreement from Henry).  Henry has neither phone nor
Email.

(2) We're starting a fund at David Gage's shop so that
Henry Grimes will be able to call & order anything he
needs for his bass ~ pickup, amp, new set of strings,
a wheel, gig bag, some resin, etc.  If you'd like to
contribute to this fund, please make a check to DAVID
GAGE STRING INSTRUMENT REPAIR, mark somewhere
on the check FOR ACCOUNT OF HENRY GRIMES, &
mail the check to:

Mr. Marshall Marrotte
4696 Tallassee Road
Athens, GA 3O6O7~2229.

Marshall's Email address is kennedymarrotte@hotmail.com .

This is so that Marshall can tabulate the amount of
the fund, & he will then immediately send the donations
on to David Gage.

(3)  Those who want to send donations, letters, cards, or
gifts to Henry Grimes directly rather than through the David
Gage fund can mail them to Marshall Marrotte (as above),
& Marshall will forward them to Henry Grimes.  (If you're
sending a donation via this route rather than through the
David Gage bass fund, please send a postal money order,
NOT a personal check, because Henry Grimes does not
have a bank account.)  Marshall Marrotte has been serving
selflessly as Henry's mentor & protector through all this,
& we are being careful not to overwhelm Henry with strangers
& fuss, so that he has time to work on playing at his own
pace & can make his way back into the music when & as
he wishes.  He is a shy, gentle, very sensitive person, & we
certainly don't want to drive him back into hiding.

(4) People who want to hold or play in concerts to honor Henry
Grimes, please go ahead & do so!  Some of us are planning
such a concert here in New York, & I think it will be huge &
very, very beautiful.  Whether Henry Grimes will attend or
participate will be entirely up to him.  Meanwhile, funds raised
can be handled the same ways as described above.

Thanks to all for caring!

as solid-seeing as  . . . . . well,  castro,  when out of missing bones
something short appears . . .  gears maybe,  or old complaints rare
with anger and protest squalor.  I read your letters . . .  all
half-defunct every word -  geographical tethers that flourishes on  the
paper is made of.   the edges are dried  tears . . .  I have forgotten
or misplaced whoever left them.   I respond with dear " I ate your
tainted word and  ancient cluster."  the ice is back, burning like
cigarettes.  your files of memories only consume my final balance.  so
I say, "let's say,"  setting over your face-fed language-rations and
nausea dream,  I know all your talking, your: bait and switch tactics,
your third class dry hearted wounds, your  biting at my tongue,  half
figure and blueprints,  calculation and in differences, wallpaper and
forbidden zone signs. "watch your step,"  or "you will break someone's
back,"  you used to say,  "or or,"  through to the other side.  piece

hearts swallowed by darc  soul.  screw one more light bulb and create
my own  egypt  written in words  on something as slippery as a

on a warm curved just outside my words



with nest and shells I function out of my inhibitions, crude types of
intimacy.  then as a mollusk, almost a form, forever short-lived or
imaginary, root into a direct reflection, every corner,  every angel,
every inch rejects restraints.  I hide the universe in my hands and
remember the seven the silences described by human geometry. the corner
produces imaginary rooms with a great number of lines leading to where
I am, or think I am.  suddenly, a flash in a novel corresponds with my
childhood where I lived incognito as a dutch stove, but that was the
contrary,  this is sincere.  there are corners to repair.  bottoms to
resist,  and my make believe the marble floor, gloomy, waits for a
refuge from ambivalence to arrive.  I pick dust off the floor, one spec
at a time.  in the distance daydreams indebted to crypts and  memory, a
wooden doll,  a simple craze,  some slippers and sensations full of
eternity (mostly dead little things)  quote nouns as  adjectives,
gives due to leonardo da vinci. I see cracks in walls, lines that lead

These things become entrenched, until they seem normal.
It saddens me to have seen generations of poets growing up thinking in terms
of tenure tracks, more to please their parents and mate than the muse. Maybe
there's no maturity in the motherly arms of institutions? But, then, there
are exceptions, like Bob Creeley and a few score more.
I do believe that some years of risk outside the institution--as Creeley
did--are necessary to have something to speak about besides theory and
technique.
 I would suggest something like universities taking into account an
applicant's experience in the world--what jobs he or she worked, traveling
done, writers visited, stuff like this--besides the basic degrees. That is,
broaden what qualifies a person to teach.

Is the "problem" really careerism in poetry, or rather how much control one
exhibits more generally in life?  Ten years of poor choices might make a
lousy poet and a poor teacher, but a cunning individual in other respects.
Then, it's simply a matter of transfer.  The important thing is to keep
yourself alive, not for its own sake, but as a matter of discipline.  That's
what institutions are for, keeping in mind, of course, that writing terrific
poems and getting terrificly high are also institutions - & ones that can
sap the life out of you quicker than a couple of graduate courses.  Why
would anyone want to yield to the fate that is anyway inevitable?  Keeping
the strings tight are 9/10ths of the game.  And that's true no matter,
labor, thief or adjunct.

Hi David

        I don't see where anyone's answered your query about Baudelaire, so I
thought to say that I think the Enid Starkie biography, tho dated (1958),
is a classic, a wonderful book, tho it probably won't give you all you
want to know about drug use.

I am sympathetic of much you say here even though I won't repeat the whole
thing here.  I share your ability to tolerate ambivalence here, difficlut as
it may be.  I also think it might be seen as poetic in addition to
therapeutic.  i chanced on the following quote from Levertov about her WWII
experiences (in a 1977 interview with Sybill Estess) " I was too immature as
an artist and as a person to deal with it."

    This omment gives me pause as one of my considerations at the moment is
a grand-daughter and I don't wnat her growing up in a country with pill
popping pilots as heros any more than one vulnerable to terrorist attacks.

   i have seen in the past that responses like joining ranks and writing
protest poems are all too easily dismissed although I certainly wouldn't
discourage participation.  At the same time I have come to the
conclusionthat in our mad world the only sane response often is a poetic
one.

Thinking about it I'm not sure what I'm asking here?

You might also try contacting David Lenson (lenson@complit.umass.edu),
author of On Drugs. I took his course on French Symbolist poetry a few years
back and we went over much of the drug culture.

collected prose in translation?  according to amazon.com there isn't,
but "of the two judges, hold to the superior one." anybody know
anything?

from what I've noticed not all MFA programs look for
the same things in their faculty (or for that matter,
English departments looking to hire creative writing
faculty who may or may not be teaching graduate
students)--

some are looking for "professional qualifications"
like an MFA from some funny place or even a PhD in
addition to book publications--just their bureaucratic
way of "proof"--

but anyone can get an MFA and anyone can publish a
book, really. if you want to teach the courses, teach
the courses, if you don't want to, don't. it doesn't
make you any better or lesser of a writer.

same thing for MFA. why do folks care so much? because
Emily Dickinson didn't have an MFA? but she did
anyways.

so what? i lived in a place where i couldn't really
hang with the writers in town (buffalo, shockingly),
so i decided to get near the writers.

but to engage in a little reverse snobbery do you know
what i *really* can't wrap my little head around? the
idea (half in jest, since i spent a little bit of time
in grad school m'self!) that someone would spend five
or more years of their life getting a PhD to
credential themselves to talk about poetry!

give me two years of MFA workshops any day of the
week!

so there. :P

"Mentor" appears to be a changing & charged instructional status, =
implicitly beyond the classroom. As a post-baccalaureate student my =
teacher was a notable poet who commuted to the university by bus from =
150 miles away, taught her class, periodically bringing along other =
young poets who were emerging, publishing and launching presses and were =
arts activists under her non-for-credit "storefront workshop" in the =
city she commuted from. She gave generously to many writers =
[tuition-paying and gratis], and specifically directed me to my first =
teaching job as she did numerous others. We remained in contact till her =
death. I considered her a mentor because her trusted tutelage and active =
guidance, as determined by her commitment and good will, went beyond the =
obligations of being a classroom teacher.=20

Does the concept of mentor imply something different in the context of =
low/non-residential MFA programs? Are there contractual or otherwise =
expected services? Is it just a hook implying that DL/Low Residency =
programs offer students something substantially beyond correspondence =
instruction?=20

I'd be interested hearing [jlipman@utnet.utoledo.edu] from respondents =
on both sides of the question.

Mairead, Geoffrey, et al.,

I have no direct experience with low-residency MFA programs, but, as you =
all
probably know, it appears that many of them are built almost entirely =
around
mentorship. As far as I can tell, there is very little actual =
"workshopping"
and most or all of the work gets done in one-on-ones between mentor and
student, both face-to-face and by correspondence, and in lectures during
residencies, which are delivered both by mentors and by students.

On the other hand, some low-residency MFA programs seem to exist solely =
for
the purpose of bringing in revenue, which I suspect is the case with =
many
more traditional MFA programs and is part of the reason why we have such =
a
glut of teaching job applicants and why some people extrapolate this
cynicism to all MFA programs. But the programs are full, so there must =
be a
market demand for them. Is there a conflict here between market demand =
and
"professional" need for these programs to exist? What's the difference?

Here in Dallas, the local literary center, The Writer's Garret, runs an
affordable, non-academic program of "community and mentorship" for =
writers
who aren't interested in paying for a degree or in devoting their lives
full-time to a course of study. Perhaps other non-academic literary =
centers
have similar programs. The element of the program that appeals most to =
the
participants is, in fact, the one-on-one mentorship program.

However, I would be interested to know whether those of us who have gone
through MFA/PhD programs in creative writing and close facsimiles =
thereof,
got the most value out of mentor relationships, out of workshopping, or
elsewhere. In my case, without a doubt (at SUNY-Binghamton), the =
greatest
value came from relationships with other students.

"Discipline." "Keeping the string tight." Cat, I feel myself choking.

Earlier in the month several lists of poetry books from 2002 went
around the list. I've since gone to my bookshelf, and these are the
2002 copyright books that I found there, that I think should get
special notice. I enjoyed them all (and am still enjoying them) very
much.

There are other books that came out in 2002 that I'm sure are
wonderful (like Gudding's, that I've heard some good buzz about), but
I haven't gotten copies yet. But for now, these are the books I'm
interested in.

A related question: why do some publishers write "poems" after the
title of a book? Does anyone find that helpful? Does it bother anyone?
I admit, it kinda bothers me.

Anyway, the list:

Chinese Whispers

The Yellow Hotel

For that matter America should be thrown out of the world. We're a

thanks for that list.  what in particular moved you about CHINESE WHISPER?  i haven't read it yet.

i've actually always liked the idea of publishers writing "poems" on the cover after a title.  i guess it's because i HATE novels so much that i don't want to have nausea from picking up one-of-those by mistake.

also, i like the idea of "poems" written on the cover because it seems most folks DO like novels, and this way they can see "poems" written on the cover and won't bother picking it up.  this keeps the grime level down on covers.

also, i like the idea of "poems" written on the cover because it's a special little key to certain inviting hearts, hearts not interested in novels, maybe, at least, i hope.

After finally seeing "Bowling for Columbine" I'm inclined
to agree with Alan, though I might not have been so
vehement before. What do others think of this film?
Personally I was surprised at how good it is, given Michael
Moore's somewhat clownish M.O. in recent years. It seems to
me especially effective at drawing broad but convincing
connections between the war on terrorism, media and the
culture of fear, endemic racism, welfare reform, corporate
ethics, the list goes on. Not wrapped up in a neat
argument, but rather thrown into a mix that seems very
organic and real: one not-so-brilliant but well-meaning guy
trying to figure it all out. There are heartbreaking
moments all through the film: two of the teenage boys shot
at Columbine going with Moore to ask K-Mart executives to
stop selling bullets for assault weapons; the mother of the
six-year-old boy who shot and killed a classmate in Flint,
Michigan, being forced to work in a glitzy suburban
restaurant owned by Dick Clark as part of Michigan's
welfare-to-work program; Moore interviewing Charlton
Heston, who held NRA rallies in Denver and in Flint just
after the violence at the schools there, and trying to
extract some human feeling from him. Even Marilyn Manson
comes across as a pretty thoughtful and intelligent guy
compared to Heston.

"No to the war against Iraq

Friends,

The anguish and the impotence are seized upon me again. I can not leave the
opportunity to express my deep worry concerning to the unfolding of men and
armaments carried out in USA and Great Britain in order to attack  Iraq. It
also makes sad the loss of answer of the remainder of the other Western
countries (although some of them timidly oppose to the possibility of war)
by stopping this brutal aggression that has been preparing, day by day, like
a great media show what will become worse, no doubt, the pain and the
necessity of people from Iraq, who are already enough hit by the blockade
and the use of atomic weapons in the previous conflict (uranium of low tenor
in the missiles).

I believe that it is absolutely unacceptable that in the new millennium the
most civilized and richest countries of the world wanted to solve their
differences against the poorest countries appealing to the violence and to
the war, omitting the Foundation Letter of the United Nations and the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Besides, it is intolerable for any sensibility that the USA give to
themselves the right of exercising "preventive attacks," against any
country, when and where they thinks it is necessary. Better say, attacks
against any countries, if not against those which cannot defend
themselves.Since it results evident that the USA will never attack France or
Japan based on so trivial arguments.

The excuse of that Iraq possesses armament of massive destruction (that
nobody could not have confirmed) is not signifcant, for  there are other
countries which  possess it, no doubts, and they have not received any
pression, as, for example, USA, Russia, North Korea, France, Great Britain,
Pakistan or India. On the other hand, USA count on political and diplomatic
mechanisms  to solve the international problems without using any tank.

I am conscious that great intellectual groups throughout the world  must be
mobilized and have to make the possible to stop this criminal madness. But,
also, I am conscious of the lacking of answer of networking, of the  mail -
artists net, or our collective group of creators at distance (some
individual intents confirm what I have said). Parodyng Epicuro: what is mail
art for, if no to the service of men?"

        I'm not a scholar, but I've never seen a Collected Prose for Baudelaire.
 I'm guessing you want the essays, in addition to the prose poems.  The
largest collections of the essays I've seen (the Salons, work on Poe,
Life & Work of Delacroix etc.) are Baudelaire:  Selected Writings on Art
& Artists, Trans by P. E. Charvet, Cambridge U P (Cambridge, 1972) at 460
pages & The Mirror of Art, Critical Studies by Charles Baudelaire, Trans
Jonathan Mayne, Doubleday Anchor (1956) at 370 pages.  I don't know if
either is in print.

I may be adrift in this discussion as I haven't been diligent with email
(!) in the last few days.  So if your message relates to a specific
point raised, forgive me.

I did a PhD largely because I didn't want to be cordoned off within an
English Department; also because, as a late starter, I wanted to get all
the degrees over with: now!  I wanted to teach literature as well as
creative writing and my experience in English Departments suggested
strongly that a PhD would be an asset on the job market, and this has
indeed proved to be the case.  I'm glad I did a PhD; I enjoyed it; I had
a wild time writing my dissertation (on metaphor, example, and
childbirth).  It helped me connect with the "real world" of action and
language.  And now that I've done it, I don't have to do it when I'm 90;
I am not barred from teaching literature courses (though this would not
happen anyway at Rhode Island School of Design, which is one reason I
like working here); and if I decide to go on the market again, the PhD
will still be on the asset side of the balance sheet: where it is
needed.  I have two children and my partner is also a poet.  Every asset
counts in the sometimes strange game of survival we play.

but to engage in a little reverse snobbery do you know
what i *really* can't wrap my little head around? the
idea (half in jest, since i spent a little bit of time
in grad school m'self!) that someone would spend five
or more years of their life getting a PhD to
credential themselves to talk about poetry!

give me two years of MFA workshops any day of the
week!

so there. :P

Clearly, I'm lagging.  ;)

Must be all that PhD work I've been doing, though I can say that after 4
years out of the academy, I can't say I got any closer to that book of poems
that anyone can publish.


Is there an emoticon for my tongue bulging in my cheek?

Subject:      Lavish Absence
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Finally got a copy of Lavish Absence: Recalling and Rereading Edmond Jabes
by Rosmarie Waldrop today and have started in on it and I really can't
praise the book enough. A few years ago I read John Felstiner's Celan
biography and was impressed with the way it seemed to be a biography written
for poets, as Felstiner consistently forgrounded Celan's reading habits
rather than his personal life. I thought THIS is what I want from a
biography, well, I was close, but now I see Rosmarie Waldrop has written
what I really wanted: a sort of biography/memoir/explication cross-genre
look at a figure of such personal importance to her, and one she'd made so
important to us non-french speaking/reading folks. This book is great!
here's a sample:

"When the linearity of reading is broken, when we are startled awake, when
the smooth horizontal travel of eye/mind is interrupted, when the connection
is broken, there is a kind of orchestral meaning that comes about in the
leap. A vertical dimension vibrating with the energy field between the two
lines (phrases, sentences), and perhaps the energy of what would have
followed/preceded, but is lacking. A meaning that both illuminates the
separation and connects across it. A meaning that goes beyond the two
elements that border it, as metaphor goes beyond the sum of tenor and
vehicle."


And here is a very haunting & moving exchange, from Waldrop's book, between
Celan and Jabes (two poets with almost opposite modes for negating Adorno's
infamous statement about poetry after Auschwitz: concision vs. precision?)
that takes place about a year before Celan's suicide:

He recalls the day when Celan came to see him with a copy of _The Book of
Questions_, heavily annotated in the margins. They talked about the book.
Suddenly Celan said:
"No, I will not translate you."
Edmond is a bit taken aback:"But--"
Celan interrupts, vehemently:"No, I cannot."
"...but I didn't ask you to. I am happy you read the book."
They go on talking, but every once in a while Celan interjects:
"I will _not_ translate you."

_____________________

here is a passage from the Felstiner book:

"...Celan, in March 1967 found _The Book of Questions by Edmond Jabes
(1912-91) and reacted against this story: "In a central European village,
the Nazis one evening buried alive some of our brothers. The earth stirred
with them for a long time. That night, the same rhythm connected all
Israelites in the world." Instead of assenting to this tragic communion,
Celan marked it "Nein!" and crossed out these sentences. Yet his copies of
Jabes have underlinings throughout, and Celan considered translating him. He
never did: perhaps Jabes leading idea, that "the difficulty of being Jewish
is the same as the difficulty of writing," grounded his own work too deeply
for him to rework it in German."

What really strikes me is the different feel these two books have, Waldrop
knew Jabes both as a person and as a poet/translator, Felstiner is not a
poet (well, I did see him read a god awful poem at a recent talk he gave, a
poem which is going to be published in the Paris Review)
nor did he know Celan, but he did have access to Celan's personal library,
where Celan notated everything!

_______________

Regardless, there's also a lot of humor in the Waldrop's book, in fact, the
work really shows a deep love. here's some more:

   "I talk to Edmond about the homophonic Catullus translations of Celia and
Louis Zukofsky...[she explains a little about the work]...But Edmond is
immediately worried: why do I bring this up? Am I tempted to try something
like it?"

Anyway, it's worth reading, every if one hasn't made it through all of
Jabes' work. In fact, this book might give you a little kick...I know I'm
going back...

The ghost of throwaway lines
visits me deeply covered in

sleepiness. Wavy respite waiving
like narcotic medusa-hair in

my face. I have "sex" with
my face, shrink-wrapp'd o'er

and embossed with novel coupling.
This makes me squeak to kiss

(milk and ice and size and shelf and tomorrow or
frozen and tomorrow and freezing or throat spores
spill lipid quagmire jettison flavor across police a
dream of feta throng gunrack in the turnstile lurch
apt choices filter choler and durable ephemera or
luscious and gamey. It's true she networks with text

winter arid like palms burnt flung. You know numbers
power front-end associations. All of us need that
space epoxy wan marbled all gigabyte distrych fellatio
rinse.  You know all numbers to that power halo zip
fields of _root. And yet I "have" sex with my face,
duplicating an inexplicable palpitating culpability.
Trigger or blowfish swollen size and dithyramb
matrices television like tinfoil tulip spectre
full.frontal clarity along the incomplete agreement or
union of you and I after work not speaking but the cat
is snapping into place or the mirrors throw up a
chokehold on sanctuary. Oasis, the cherries were,
festive venn flux.

Today I woke up and. The storage of take away this
blindness sips from look I try, things shelving fat in
my face shaved of its sheath and no-one. None.  All
the taste drains from my mouth. A shrink-wracked
charcoal rose of chocolate sores percolates tame
emerald rafts of fittest quicksand whirlpool
gimlet-in-cheek trained on crossing hairs with you in
the evening as the sky oxidizes backwards into male
and female tabs for the cat. How else fit in this
ground? Blown powder crushes shed bone dew on plastic
agility chords. Awake now, only eyes walking, sliced
cold: crisp pints rotund with ingrown pocket mirror.
The chokecherries of sanctity indemnify bank loams
with throttle vomit cleats.  Venn, I sled, honey
masterpiece in ego goad, coding cashflow into sob
acids that identity horny dawn flaws in flowered
obstacles. How long will you stay? I guess days banish
shimmer nettles all across a deliciousness of the
backs of her knees. Squat a while away in text
networking, playful spike looms on which children toss
guidance like sniffles flirt onion nouns)

my fate, tables bludgeoning
real sirens in so early a morning

only commerce is awake, and trucks
growl the red snow we need. Moving

on, a ghost of strewn lives sits up
in the middle of a night of fever, hands

bandaged from glass. I pull them
out of you; cover my face like a mosque.

Dear MWP,
After a few years on this & other lists I decided to
get the U.S. Poetics list as a digest so as to
decrease the volume of email I receive. And that's
been great - I get the text generated texts etc etc
etc - but really, that last one took up far too much
scrolling space. The August Highland one seemed a bit
facile this time too - or am I wearying ?
Maybe the point has been made to the Poetics list -
why labour it ?
(I know I don't participate in the discourse very
often but I guess this shouldn't prevent me from an
occasional remark or, in this case, complaint.)
Thanks,
Pam Brown

                     you are invited to join us as....

                   Kelly Writers House Fellows presents

         a conversation with legendary screenwriter WALTER BERNSTEIN

                             via live webcast

                  10 AM eastern time - Tuesday - February 18


                        Among the most eminent living screenwriters,
                        WALTER BERNSTEIN was first a regular
                        contributor to The New Yorker and wrote for some
                        of early television's finest dramatic shows. He is
                        best known as the writer of films, among them
                        FAIL SAFE, THE MOLLY MAGUIRES, THE MAGNIFICENT
                        SEVEN, and THE FRONT (for which he received an
                        Academy Award nomination). During the
                        anticommunist period, he was blacklisted and
                        could not work openly as a writer. His memoir,
                        INSIDE OUT, is an account of this experience.


To participate in the webcast, you will only need to click on a web link.
If you rsvp, we will send you the address for that link - and all other
simple instructions.

RSVP to whfellow@english.upenn.edu - and be sure to specify that you are
joining us by webcast.

I was curious as to the origin of the phrase "the thief of time"
which I used as the title for the Haiku I sent out to the list yesterday. I
found it the following poem by Edward Young:

=A0  =20
Edward Young (1683-1765)
 l
The Complaint: or Night Thoughts on Life, Death, and Immortality

(excerpt)


Night the First
=A0 =A0 =A0 By Nature's law, what may be, may be now;
=A0 =A0 =A0 There's no prerogative in human hours.
=A0 =A0 =A0 In human hearts what bolder thought can rise,
=A0 =A0 =A0 Than man's presumption on to-morrow's dawn?
=A0 =A0 =A0 Where is to-morrow? In another world.
=A0 =A0 =A0 For numbers this is certain; the reverse
=A0 =A0 =A0 Is sure to none; and yet on this perhaps,
=A0 =A0 =A0 This peradventure, infamous for lies,
=A0 =A0 =A0 As on a rock of adamant we build
=A0 =A0 =A0 Our mountain hopes, spin out eternal schemes
=A0 =A0 =A0 As we the Fatal Sisters could out-spin,
=A0 =A0 =A0 And big with life's futurities, expire.
=A0 =A0 =A0 Not ev'n Philander had bespoke his shroud,
=A0 =A0 =A0 Nor had he cause; a warning was deny'd:
=A0 =A0 =A0 How many fall as sudden, not as safe!
=A0 =A0 =A0 As sudden, though for years admonish'd home.
=A0 =A0 =A0 Of human ills the last extreme beware;
=A0 =A0 =A0 Beware, Lorenzo, a slow-sudden death.
=A0 =A0 =A0 How dreadful that deliberate surprise!
=A0 =A0 =A0 Be wise to-day; 'tis madness to defer;
=A0 =A0 =A0 Next day the fatal precedent will plead;
=A0 =A0 =A0 Thus on, till wisdom is push'd out of life.
=A0 =A0 =A0 Procrastination is the thief of time;
=A0 =A0 =A0 Year after year it steals, till all are fled,
=A0 =A0 =A0 And to the mercies of a moment leaves
=A0 =A0 =A0 The vast concerns of an eternal scene.

damian & others, i think ~bowling for columbine~ should be up for an
oscar (for best film, not just best doc)... i've heard its essayistic
style criticized by those who prefer e.g. godard's approach to film
essay-polemic, but i think they miss the point---moore has offered us
an argument that's not afraid to change its mind as it goes along...

i found it utterly compelling... and at the showing i attended in a
large mall theater complex here in the boulder-denver (-littleton
etc.) region, the audience applauded at the end...

best,

Ink-jet printing creates tubes of living tissue


19:00=A022=A0January=A003


Exclusive from New Scientist Print Edition

=A0

Three-dimensional tubes of living tissue have been printed using=20
modified desktop printers filled with suspensions of cells instead of=20
ink. The work is a first step towards printing complex tissues or even=20=

entire organs.


"This could have the same kind of impact that Gutenberg's press did,"=20
claims tissue engineer Vladimir Mironov of the Medical University of=20
South Carolina.


Many labs can now print arrays of DNA, proteins or even cells. But for=20=

tissue engineers, the big challenge is creating three-dimensional=20
structures. Mironov became interested when Thomas Boland of Clemson=20
University, also in South Carolina, told Mironov how he could print=20
biomaterials using modified ink-jet printers.


The printers are adapted by washing out the ink cartridges and=20
refilling them with suspensions of, say, cells. The software that=20
controls the viscosity, electrical resistances and temperature of the=20
printing fluids is reprogrammed and the feed systems altered.


  Thermo-reversible gel

To create 3D structures, Boland and Mironov used a "thermo-reversible"=20=

gel recently developed by Anna Gutowska at the Pacific Northwest=20
National Laboratory in Richland, Washington. The non-toxic,=20
biodegradable gel is liquid below 20 =B0C and solidifies above 32 =B0C.

=A0

Printing organs



The team has done several experiments using easily available tissues=20
such as hamster ovary cells. By printing alternate layers of the gel=20
and clumps of cells onto glass slides, they have shown 3D structures=20
such as tubes can be built up.


Biologists have long known that bits of tissue placed next to each=20
other can fuse. The researchers found that as long as the layers were=20
thin enough for the clumps to come into contact with each other, the=20
bits of tissue fused. Once a structure is complete, the gel is easily=20
removed. Details of the team's initial work will soon be published.


Like printing with different colours, placing different types of cells=20=

in the ink cartridges should make it possible to recreate complex=20
structures consisting of multiple cell types. "I think this is=20
extremely exciting technology that has the potential to overcome some=20
of the major obstacles [to tissue engineering] we have seen in the=20
past," says leading tissue engineer Anthony Atala of Harvard Medical=20
School in Boston.


  Degradable scaffold

Other groups have developed ways of building up tissues layer by layer=20=

(New Scientist print edition, 4 January), but none is as simple and=20
quick as printing. Most tissue engineers first create a degradable=20
scaffold and then seed it with cells. This technique can be used to=20
create complex shapes, such as the infamous "ear on a mouse", but=20
placing different cell types precisely is very difficult.



Printing should make it easier to position cells, but many other=20
problems will have to be overcome before entire organs can be created.=20=

A huge challenge in tissue-engineering solid organs, for example, is=20
supplying enough oxygen and nutrients to sustain cells deep within the=20=

structure.


"It's been the holy grail of tissue engineering, to be able to create=20
adequate circulatory networks for complex organs," Atala says.


Mironov and Boland hope it will be possible to print the entire network=20=

of arteries, capillaries and veins that nourish organs. But to keep=20
cells alive, the organs would have to be completed within a couple of=20
hours and a growth medium circulated through the fragile new vessels.


Large structures might not be strong enough to hold together if the gel=20=

is removed after such a short period. However, the team is already=20
experimenting with adding substances such as the skin protein collagen=20=

to speed fusion and reinforce structures.

Printing is not the only promising new technique for creating entire=20
organs. It might one day be possible to grow them in situ. In December,=20=

scientists in Israel reported that they had managed to grow miniature=20
but fully functional kidneys by implanting fetal pig or human cells=20
into immunodeficient mice.

But growing organs from scratch will take much longer than printing=20
them, Mironov says. "Patients don't always have the luxury to wait."

Happy Louis Zukofsky Birthday everybody!


in response to an earlier remark in this space, ,,,, Yes I can imagine an
MA student getting financial aid,,,,, both my current university and my
previous department provided support packages at the MA level -- I don't
know how things went in the English dept. at UCLA, but when my wife was a
grad student there she got a full support package for the first year of her
MA program in film studies  (the term "full support" of course being wildly
off) --

and on the factor of O'Reilly, a true sot weed factor indeed, at the
beginning of his program he teased the Baraka segment by stating that
Baraka had claimed that "Jews" had advance knowledge of 9-11,,,,,,  which,
of course, is not quite what the poem, or the poet, said --- as Baraka
points out in the course of the interview, all the poetry O'Reilly wanted
to confront him with (none of which he appeared to have read in its
entirety) was from the 60s -- no doubt, as O'Reilly himself said, because
he thought that the most inflammatory -- and there was no reading from
Baraka's own writings renouncing his positions of the cultural nationalist
period, which, I presume, might have complicated the inflammation
--  Apparently we should give Judge Pickering a pass for being warm-hearted
towards cross burners, but the thought of Baraka teaching is lunacy ----

The phrase "Thief of Time" was also brought back into
general circulation by the title of a 2001 national
best-seller novel by Terry Pritchett.


Edward Young, of course, seems to be borrowing
(stealing) the concept from John Milton, whose Sonnet
VII includes: "Time, the subtle thief of youth".


Later, Robert Montgomery's 1854 "A Vision of Hell" has

   What eyes devour'd him with adoring looks!
   Thus pass'd the day; then came the midnight Mask
   And ball, with every splendid thief of time . . .

and Henry Ellison wrote an 1875 sonnet entitled
"'Procrastination is the Thief of Time'", where that
saw is given in quotation marks within the title
itself, so it may have had a life as a proverb.

Mairead, Geoffrey, Brian etc

We at Pavement Saw have a mentorship program where poets work here 5-10
hours a week reading submissions, doing mailings and so on in exchange
for being able to borrow books from our library, learn how to submit,
what publications are active, read sample copies, and come up with an
understanding of what currently is out in the world poetry-wise. They
also bring their current work to a weekly workshop I conduct. We
currently have seven people active with this program. Our rules are
simple: no drugs, no weapons. Since the requirement of time is fairly
heavy, with "homework" (we assign poets for interns to read), we have a
tendency to attract people who are serious about becoming "full-time
poets." It is a mixed lot of people, ranging in age from 23-51,
consisting of non-traditional students, high school dropouts, ex-felons,
and college graduates.

I, too, wonder what is gained from a low or non-residency program. I
have been asked about these programs many times and still have not
formed a solid opinion. What I am most curious about, if anyone works in
a such a program, is how a sense of community is established in such a
brief timespan? Is it really conducive to the continuation of writing or
does the person already need a daily practice?

I Reply:

I have no personal experience with low-residency programs, but I do
know some people who teach in them. i don't know these people well,
so we haven't spoken about the programs much. People who teach in
low-residency programs usually also have full-time teaching jobs at
other universities, so the time they put into the low-residency work is
fairly little.

I spoke recently with a student of a low-residency program, and she
said that she really liked it. She sends poems and she gets letters back
from a faculty poet. It doesn't sound like community is much of a goal
of these programs, but mentorship (by letter) could be. I suppose.

If someone wants to have a connection to some poets, has a little
money, and can't or won't move to a university, low-residency
programs do offer an opportunity, of sorts. And then there's a degree,
as well.

Ambivalently yours,

Thanks to those who responded finally --I was feeling rather hung up to
dry. I will look into the Starkie bio when I get a chance --still I can't
help wishing for a more Baudelaire-specific text about the drugs, or a
drug-specific text about Baudelaire. What got me started was his long essay
"The Poem of Hashish," which fell into my hands at the flea market. Sounds
like a fun read, and it is, but not in the way you'd expect: "[I]t is
surely superfluous to labor the point of the immorality of hashish. If I
should compare it to slow suicide, to a weapon always bloody and always
ready-sharpened, no reasonable man will take exception." And I'm all,
"what?" My surmise is that he was using hashish to express what he couldn't
bring himself to say about opium & absinthe, but I wanted to check it out,
& hence my 2 am question to the list.

Maybe I will check out that Marcus Boon book, because I have similar
questions for Poe, Nietzsche, Peirce -- and plenty of visual artists. Has
anyone contemplated Piranesi's etchings of prisons, comparing their light &
airy 1st states with the nightmarish versions he issued later in life? I
can't help thinking the early versions were opium-fueled fantasies, and a
lot of fun for him --but that the later editions, minatory and brooding,
are the older artist's regretful meditation on addiction. Just a theory --I
don't "know" the first thing about Piranesi's life or habits. I'm pretty
sure Caravaggio was a stoner, though LRSN

Coupla points, Pam B.

First, if somebody didn't say the piece was "too" something I would have
felt I failed, so thanks for that -- seriously. And yes it was WAAAAY too
long, but if people can't push the envelope on an experimental literature
list, where can they? I guess you would prefer that we all stop doing this
sort of thing and let such topics as the MFA pro/con debate continue
unabated, hm? No offense to the participants involved, but if that were the
case, I would be gone from here in a heartbeat. I happen to appreciate very
much the gratuitous scraps of poetry that appear in my email box like
valentines (or bombs?) every day, even when some are sloppy and some are
crude and some try and woo me with long boring missives that I will never do
more than skim.

Second, the work was intended to be scrolled through as part of the
revelation of its form. I didn't know what else to do but let it be what it
had to be. If it was improper to post something this long, well again
impropriety is part of being a writer, I think, and that involves offending
and even outraging people, and thus, perhaps, getting them to think anew
about old ideas, such as the idea of what a haiku (and an email to a
discussion list!) is supposed to be.

I don't want to belabor my defense of the posting, and this will be my last
public words on the subject, but if anybody else here also found that it
went too far, I can only say that I fully understand and do not care. I only
hope that some of you were able to overcome your initial outrage to see the
value of the piece, assuming it had any, and that it made a few people
happy. (I take it as a given that it made many people mad.)

NPR did a story this morning about Amiri Baraka and the New Jersey
legislature's decision to revoke the laureateship.  (Apparently, you can't
fire a laureate--talk about poetry careerism!)  It was a very sympathetic
to the poet.  Baraka got the last word, which is that apparently the State
of New Jersey is perfectly happy to be depicted as the home of the
Sopranos, but is apparently afraid of poetry.

Bowling For Columbine was a restless turn from the mantra- more guns=more violence. Period. A brave position to take for a filmmaker whose core audience subscribes to that very idea.

I'm not sure if my issue is w/ Moore or the moviegoers, but I found the liberal condescension aggravating during the Nichols interview. The soy farmer's a big joke because he isn't familiar w/ Gandhi's passive resistance tactics. Ha Ha Ha. In a classic case of "good liberal" disconnect, the fact that veggie burgers aren't grown in the university lab by their Sociology professor never crossed their mind.

You might be interested to see the latest issue of the Southern Poverty Law
Center's _Intelligence Report_, which includes an account of James
Nichols's ceremonial induction into the Christian Identity religion last
fall --at about the same time _Bowling_ was released, in fact. The story is
on their website --

I don't pretend that Nichols is a human rights champion, or that he's not a right-wing extremist. Look at the company he kept! But you bring up a great point.

His alleged induction into the Aryan Israelite cult coincided w/ the release of Bowling For Columbine. Coincidence? Probably. But consider this. While the Left laughs at the American farmer, the Right is embracing them. The Heartland is the core of Christian Identity sympathy. Largely, the Left has abandoned them.

Did anyone see this broadcast?
From the transcript, it looks like Baraka did quite well for himself.

I still hold that "Somebody Blew Up America" is not a very good
poem. But this was the most interesting thing I've ever seen come
from O'Reilly's program. I wish Baraka could do that to him every
week.

I suppose that Nichols' ignorance of Gandhi could be an
occasion for liberal condescension, but for me the moment
didn't play that way. Instead it was horrifying. This is
not exactly esoteric knowledge. If Nichols had never heard
of Cesar Chavez or Noam Chomsky, that would be one thing.
But Gandhi? I would consider it condescending to assume
that he hadn't heard of him, given that we no longer live
in a culture where the midwestern farmer is cut off from
the rest of the world.

To me it plays like a real-life Taxi Driver, a film I saw
again recently -- a person with an autodidactic drive
and a self-aggrandizing temperament can potentially
assemble, from the detritus of contemporary U.S. culture, a
view of history and one's place in it that would seem to
justify the most outrageous (and arbitrary) violence.

Which seems to me an apt description of Bush -- a parallel
the film also implies.

How Alec Baldwin Outted the Fox Blowhard

Bill O'Reilly's Fascism
By TOM GORMAN

Last year on a special broadcast, "O'Reilly versus Hollywood" (Fox News
Special, 6/7/02), Bill O'Reilly purported to "take-on" the "phoniness" of
entertainers who are politically active. Of particular pique to O'Reilly
was a comment from actor Alec Baldwin on a March episode of the
now-defunct Politically Incorrect. Responding to the idea that a President
Gore would have been less steadfast in his response to terrorism than
President Bush, Baldwin said: "If you watched Fox [News] and all those
other fascists over there, that's exactly what they would have had you
believe." O'Reilly complained to entertainment journalist Jeanne Wolf (The
O'Reilly Factor, 6/7/02) that "if you're going to point fingers at people,
and call them names like Alec Baldwin said the Fox News Channel are
fascists, . . . you've got to back it up."

from O'Reilly's program. I wish Baraka could do that to him every
week.

I saw the broadcast.  Neither "contestant" did well for himself.  As the
transcript indicates, neither Baraka nor O'Reilly was able to finish a
sentence.  It was an exercise in egotistic incoherence, much like any war.
We are treated daily to the Jerry Springer/WWE brand of news, and both the
left and the right contribute to this nonsense.  This, it seems, is what
americans crave.  One fool vs. another.   Best, Bill

Why Bill O'Reilly is Insane
by Amiri Baraka
special to the Assassinated Press


BILL O'REILLY, HOST:  In the Personal Story segment tonight, the poet
laureate of New Jersey Amiri Baraka.  He angered millions of Americans by
writing a poem that said the Bush administration and the Israeli government,
among others, knew in advance that the World Trade Center was going to be
attacked on 9/11.  The New Jersey legislature right now could have fired him,
but he continues to defend his position.

AMIRI BARAKA, NEW JERSEY POET LAUREATE:  "Who knew the World Trade Center was
going to get bombed?  Well, the Bush administration knew."  I agree with
this.
"And it is everywhere on the Internet.  Not only that -- was the U.S. warned
repeatedly by Germany, France, Russia, England, but also Israel.  Who told
4,000 Israeli workers in the Twin Towers to stay home that day?  Why did
Sharon stay away?" unquote.
Now to infer that I am accusing Israel of committing this atrocity is
disingenuous slander and character assassination.  But I do believe, as I
stated about England, Germany, France, Russia, that the Israeli government,
certainly its security force, knew about the attack in advance.

O'REILLY:  All right.  With us now is Amiri Baraka.
Now I'm more interested in, you know, who you are and what you think rather
than this crazy 9/11 theory you have.

BARAKA:  OK.

O'REILLY:  I mean, you're an American.  You're free to believe anything you
want, but it's just nutty, in my opinion.
Do you believe...

BARAKA:  Well, why do you attack me?  If I'm free to believe it, why do you
attack me?

O'REILLY:  I'm just saying it's nutty.  That's my opinion.  I hold that.
Now do you believe in the Holocaust?

BARAKA:  Of course.

O'REILLY:  OK.  So you don't have any problems with what happened...

BARAKA:  But criticizing Israel does not mean you're anti-Semitic.

O'REILLY:  Oh, come on.  You...

BARAKA:  That's the big lie.

O'REILLY:  ... can criticize all day long, but...

BARAKA:  That's the big lie.

O'REILLY:  ... if you say they knew about the 9/11 attack beforehand...

BARAKA:  So did Bush.

O'REILLY:  Wait.

BARAKA:  So did Bush.

O'REILLY:  Look, some people believe in the Easter Bunny.  Do you be that?
Come on.

BARAKA:  Well, if you believe Bush is the Easter Bunny, but there are four
FBI agents suing for the same reason, who said they gave information about
Zacarias Moussaoui...

O'REILLY:  You're -- you're...

BARAKA:  ... about...

O'REILLY:  You're on the Internet there too much with all due respect.

BARAKA:  Well, it -- why is Internet less believable than The Post...

O'REILLY:  All right.  Because there's no editor on...

BARAKA:  ... or The Wall Street Journal?

O'REILLY:  There's no editor on the Internet.

BARAKA:  That might be better.

O'REILLY:  You can write whatever you want to write.

BARAKA:  That might be better.

O'REILLY:  But let's find out who you are and what you think.

BARAKA:  Sure.

O'REILLY:  You've been accused of being anti-white.  Do you dislike white
people?

BARAKA:  No, that was before -- actually, earlier, when they killed Malcolm
X, I had that kind of reaction briefly.  You know, that's why it's kind of,
you know, absurd to say I was anti-Semitic because I hated all white people
after that.

O'REILLY:  You hated all white people after...

BARAKA:  Sure.  But, later, I adjusted, you know, and I...

O'REILLY:  So you just hate some of us now or...

BARAKA:  No, I just...

O'REILLY:  What's your hatred level?

BARAKA:  It's not -- it doesn't have to do with like ethnicity or skin color.
 It has to do with ideology.  I hate right-wing bigots.  That's for sure.

O'REILLY:  OK.  How about left-wing bigots?

BARAKA:  Oh, well, left -- a bigot is a bigot.

O'REILLY:  All right.  So you don't like any bigot.

O'REILLY:  A bigot is a bigot.  You don't like any bigots.

BARAKA:  No, no bigots.

O'REILLY:  All right.  Good.  Well, I'm with you on that.  How's that?

BARAKA:  Good.  That's good.  You don't seem like it.

O'REILLY:  Well, that's OK.  You form your own opinion.

BARAKA:  Right, right.  Right.  Thank you.

O'REILLY:  Now President Bush -- you realize -- you firmly believe that he
would have
allowed 3,000 Americans to die in the streets?

BARAKA:  Absolutely.

O'REILLY:  And why would he...

BARAKA:  Can I tell you...

O'REILLY:  And why would he have allowed that?

BARAKA:  So that he can run around the world and make a military dictatorship
of the world.

O'REILLY:  So he wants to...

BARAKA:  Let me ask you this.  Let me ask you this.  If you know anything
about flying, you know that you cannot go up in the air without filing a
route.  How can you make a 90-degree turn from Boston, two airplanes,
commercial airliners, fly down to the World Trade Center without being
challenged, no ground-to-air missiles, no...

O'REILLY:  There weren't any ground-to-air missiles in that area, and...

BARAKA:  Well, there were...

O'REILLY:  ... they did...

BARAKA:  And you're supposed to first communicate by radio.

O'REILLY:  But, again, Mr. Baraka, look, if you want to think...

BARAKA:  ... of the world say...

O'REILLY:  If you want to think that that was a big world conspiracy, then go
ahead and think that, all right.

BARAKA:  Worldwide conspiracy.

O'REILLY:  I'm not going to dissuade you, all right.

BARAKA:  You'll deny it then.

O'REILLY:  I will deny it, and I'll go a step further.  You're insane, and
it's insane to for the State of New Jersey...

BARAKA:  If I was insane, I'd have a television program.

O'REILLY:  OK.  Look, it's -- it's insane for the State of New Jersey to pay
you as a poet laureate.

BARAKA:  They haven't paid me yet.

O'REILLY:  All right.  Well, you're on the payroll.

BARAKA:  If they want to find some real anti-Semites, they should go to Ezra
Pound and T.S. Eliot who were taught in the schools.

O'REILLY:  All right.  Fine.
I want you to react to one of your poems "Black Art" and explain this, OK.

BARAKA:  That was written in 1965, right.  Go ahead.

O'REILLY:  All right.
"We want 'poems that kill.'  Assassin poems, Poems that is shoot guns.  Poems
that wrestle cops into alleys and take their weapons leaving them dead with
tongues pulled out and sent to Ireland.

BARAKA:  Keep reading.

O'REILLY:  Well, that's -- that's the portion that really -- because the
Ireland thing really piqued my interest.  What does that mean?

BARAKA:  What it means -- it means I want poems that are physical, that have
a presence, that are not abstract and idealistic.  That's what it means.

O'REILLY:  All right, but why did you...

BARAKA:  It means I want images that are strong enough to influence people in
the real world.

O'REILLY:  Why did you choose to use the violence against cops?

BARAKA:  Cops.  Because cops kill black people.  They still are.  I mean, if
you think Amadou Diallo is not an incident of violence...

O'REILLY:  But do police kill white people, too?

BARAKA:  Excuse me.

O'REILLY:  Do police kill white people, too?

BARAKA:  Absolutely.  That's why white people should oppose them.

O'REILLY:  OK.  So you believe all police in this country should be opposed?

BARAKA:  No, not all police.  That's like saying all people are this, all
people are that.

O'REILLY:  Well, which ones should be opposed?

BARAKA:  The backward ones.  The racist ones.  The ones that...

O'REILLY:  And how do we identify them?

BARAKA:  You're supposed to test them.  You're supposed to train them.

O'REILLY:  Oh, you're supposed to test them.

BARAKA:  Right.

O'REILLY:  Do you have a bigot test, do you?

BARAKA:  Sure you do.

O'REILLY:  And how is that?

BARAKA:  It's like the test they gave in the U.S. Army after they saw the
triumph of the will by Leni Riefenstahl.  They found out that there was a
rise in anti-Semitic and fascist feeling by 20-some percent.  That's a test
that the U.S. Army gives.  You can make tests to find out about people.  You
know, the Rorschach test...

O'REILLY:  Can you design that -- I'd like for you to design that and send it
to me.

BARAKA:  I could -- I could design it.

O'REILLY:  All right.  Here's a quote from you from the "New Republic."  It
says...

BARAKA:  Will you give me permission to do it?  I would do it.

O'REILLY:  No. Design it, and I'll read it on the air, all right?

BARAKA:  OK.

O'REILLY:  "Here the black man is called rapist, where the rolling of his
eyes can get him in trouble.  That is, the average ofay" --
Is ofay a white person?  Is that a white person?

BARAKA:  Well, it used to be.  That's pig latin.  Pig latin for foe.

O'REILLY:  OK.  "Thinks -- thinks of the black man as potentially raping
every white lady in sight.  Which is true, in the sense that the black man
should want to rob the white man of everything he has."

BARAKA:  Well, why do you keep reading things from the '60s that are...

O'REILLY:  I -- look, I've got a compilation of your stuff, and I figured I'd
pick the most inflammatory.

BARAKA:  Well, those are the '60s.  Well, I thought that somebody who blew up
America was inflammatory.

O'REILLY:  Somebody what?

BARAKA:  Somebody who blew up America.  I think that was inflammatory.

O'REILLY:  It was.  But I don't want to -- see, it's a loony theory, with all
due respect.

BARAKA:  I have another...

O'REILLY:  I don't want to...

BARAKA:  I have another inflammatory poem.  It's called "Loco for Bush II
(ph)."  "The main thing wrong with you is you're ain't in jail."  That's an
inflammatory...

O'REILLY:  OK.  Well, again, you're an American.  You have the right.

BARAKA:  Thank you.

O'REILLY:  Now you're going to teach kids in Newark public schools?

BARAKA:  We've already started.  Last week.

O'REILLY:  All right.  And what exactly are you going to teach them, how bad
the...

BARAKA:  We're going to teach them poetry.

O'REILLY:  ... government is?

BARAKA:  No, we're going to teach them -- they know that themselves.

O'REILLY:  Oh, they know that themselves.

BARAKA:  We're going to enhance their understanding of...

O'REILLY:  Are you going to say the Pledge of Allegiance before you teach?

BARAKA:  Well, the part  -- if you put God in it, doesn't that mean you're
making state and church...

O'REILLY:  Not to me it doesn't.  How do you feel about it?

BARAKA:  How do I feel about what?  The Pledge of Allegiance?

O'REILLY:  Do you believe in God?

BARAKA:  No, I'm a Marxist.

O'REILLY:  OK. You're a Marxist.

BARAKA:  I believe that everybody can believe what they believe.

O'REILLY:  All right.  So you're a Marxist.  So you don't believe in God.

BARAKA:  A Marxist.

O'REILLY:  Right.  You don't...

BARAKA:  A communist.

O'REILLY:  You don't like this country at all, right?

BARAKA:  Well, no, I...

O'REILLY:  You like this country?

BARAKA:  ... love this country, but I don't like what it's done to black
people.  We here - came here at the bottom of the boats.  You know that poem
that goes, "At the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean is a railroad made of human
bones."

O'REILLY:  Right.  But let me get this.

BARAKA:  Yes.

O'REILLY:  So you don't believe in God, you're a Marxist in this -- a
capitalist country.

BARAKA:  I believe everybody...

O'REILLY:  All right.  You believe Bush has...


O'REILLY:  ... intentionally killed 3,000 people...

BARAKA:  Yes.  He didn't stop it.

O'REILLY:  ... because he wants to take over the world.

BARAKA:  Let's stay that.

O'REILLY:  Right.  OK.

BARAKA:  He knew about it.

O'REILLY:  And you believe that a lot of whites are bigots and...

BARAKA:  You don't believe that?

O'REILLY:  No, I don't.  I believe most Americans...

BARAKA:  What was slavery?  What happened to slavery?

O'REILLY:  Well I was -- I was -- you know, that...

BARAKA:  That was a long time ago.

O'REILLY:  Slavery was older than some of your poems I read, you know.

BARAKA:  Well, are you saying Diallo -- that was slavery.  Are you saying...

O'REILLY:  I'm saying the jury...

BARAKA:  ... Byrd in Texas -- that was slavery.

O'REILLY:  I will tell you this.  The jury that...

BARAKA:  Are you telling me the man who was murdered in Alabama...

O'REILLY:  ... had black Americans on it acquitted the policemen.  That's all
I can tell you.

BARAKA:  I know.

O'REILLY:  Black Americans...

BARAKA:  Are you going to tell me that Bush being against affirmative action,
that's not a
continuation?  Are you telling me that Bush getting into office...

O'REILLY:  With all due respect, Mr...

BARAKA:  Baraka.

O'REILLY:  Baraka, right.  You know, I'm cloudy here because you're throwing
a lot of stuff at me.  You teaching schoolchildren...

BARAKA:  I taught school for 20 years.

O'REILLY:  ... is akin to me having Mussolini come in and teach children.

BARAKA:  Well, your being on television is akin to having Goebbels on
television.

O'REILLY:  All right.  Well, I guess we...

BARAKA:  Joseph Goebbels.  It's the same thing.

O'REILLY:  I guess we don't have too much common ground, other than we both
don't like bigots.

BARAKA:  We can talk about what -- we don't understand what each other is
saying.

O'REILLY:  All right.  I've got to tell you I appreciate you coming on in.  I
think you're a lunatic, and...

BARAKA:  Yes.  Well, I think you're a lunatic who's more dangerous because
you're on television.

O'REILLY:  All right.  Mr. Baraka, thank you very much.  We appreciate it.

BARAKA:  Thank you very much.  That was short and sweet.

The problem is that if you don't take the tack that Baraka took last night,
O'Reilly will roll you over. You must be guileless with the man--unless you

What?!!?  No one is forced to appear on that idiotic show, and there is
nothing wrong with being rolled over by some "spinning" big mouth.
Intelligent viewers will understand what is happening.  But there are people
out there who think that one must be in one camp or another, that the world
is black and white, and cannot fathom the possibiltiy that both Baraka and
O'Reilly are opposite sides of the same counterfeit coin.  Oh well, do it
goes.  Best, Bill

I disagree. Baraka went on the show to counter the O'Reilly's venom with
some of his own. FOX is one of the most watched news stations in the
US  and is closely aligned with the White House. To have someone like
Baraka sharing his "radical" views on FOX is wonderful. And, what, Bill,
should Baraka just stick to talking to small groups of poets  in the Lower
East Side or in Washington or in Newark? What better place for him to go
than on FOX and face the powers that be. I absolutely applaud him. Yes,
people who watch FOX probably thought he was crazy, but if they saw
O'Reilly reciprocating the insanity, they might have gained some insight
into the news that they are feeding themselves. --Ak

Die Welt ist alles, was der Fall ist.
Ogden:
The world is everything that is the case.
Pears/McGuinness:
The world is all that is the case.
Die Welt ist die Gesamtheit der Tatsachen, nicht der Dinge.
Pears/McGuinness:
The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
Ogden:
The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
...
Die Tatsachen im logischen Raum sind die Welt.
Die Welt zerfallt in Tatsachen.
Ogden:
The facts in logical space are the world.
The world divides into facts.
...
Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, daruber muss man schweigen.
Ogden:
Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.
Pears/McGuinness:
What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.
(From beginning and end of Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,
Ogden translation 1922, Pears/McGuinness translation 1961.)

TLP describes a Dostoevskian crystalline world divisible into facts. The
German is clear; the motto to the book, by Kurnberger states, in trans-
lation: ...and whatever a man knows, whatever is not mere rumbling, and
roaring that he has heard, can be said in three words.

TLP portends ideality. The world is logical, mathematical, capable of
clear division. Logical space is the space, I would assume, of the natural
numbers, if not the integers; as Russell says in his introduction, TLP
presents, inscribes, a finite mathematics - there's no room for the
continuum, and proof of the continuum hypothesis was far in the future.

The translations are different, almost never radically so, but different
nonetheless. There is a residue in German such that both English versions
converge, but often never meet. The sememes are equivalent, but only to a
degree; translations are almost never one-to-one.

In this logical space of facts, programming, and protocols, there is
always a wavering, always room, always doubt, critique, and I would say
desire as well. Never mind that this wor(l)d breaks down, evidenced a few
decades later by Godel, Tarski, Skolem, etc.: Coherency, living within the
safety-net of mathesis, matrix, maternality, remains a dream of humanity.
DNA coding, cryptography, hacking the world - all appear to guarantee that
everything is possible.

Computer languages are logical; computers are presumed so, but aren't;
protocols are logical as well; logical spaces may be compared to
drive-space; garbage-in, garbage-out; and so forth. Hacking depends on a
closed world with closed loopholes; the loopholes themselves are coherent,
logical, _there._

Codework, code writing, rides within and throughout the logical world, as
a disturbance, a sign of things to come, both extension and breakdown.

Where does the content lie? Is it in the translation of code into
messiness or residue? Is it in the interpretation of residue? Or perhaps,
and herewith a criticism, is it in the wonderment, confusion, and novelty
of the residue itself?

Is codework a minor art, minor literature? What is the point of repeatedly
shaking the scaffolding - if not the emergence, in the future, of an other
or another approach, or an other, being or organism, for which codework
now both provides augury and its weakness as portal/welcoming? For what is
come among us already no longer speaks the world of logical facts, just as
computers are no longer large-scale calculators, but something else as
well, something unnamed, fearful - that fearfulness already documented by,
say, Cruikshank in the 19th century.

Codework references the alterity of a substrate which supports, generates,
and behaves as a catalyst in relation to its production. To this extent,
codework is self-referential, but no text is completely self-referential
(sr); things waver. So for example 'ten letters' and 'two words' and
'english' may be considered sr - but only to the extent that the phrases
are presumed to apply to themselves. Extended: 'This sentence has
thirty-one letters.' - 'This sentence has five words.' - 'This is an
english sen- tence.'

What is the residue? What are the sentences 'about'? On the surface,
letters, words, language. This is an additional or diacritical relation-
ship to sr; if one, for example, didn't know english, none of these would
make sense.

All sr possesses a residue - an _attribute tag._ In codework, which has a
component of sr, the tag may be plural, muddied - the world is never
presumed complete, total. Codework is not an instance in this regard of
mathematical platonism or Godelian-platonism; if anything it relies on the
breakdown of the ideal, pointing out the meaning-component of computation,
program, protocol, even the strictest formalisms.

Early on Whitehead pointed out that 2+2 = 4, but only in a certain formal
sense; in fact, the equation implies an operation or unifying process;
within the 4, the components are combined, their history lost. Strictly,
'2+2' and '4' are equivalent; within the symbolic, they differ - for that
matter, in terms of thermodynamics as well. This domain is expanded by
codework, which endlessly interferes.

The danger of codework is in its delimitation; it tends to repeat; the
works tend towards considerable length; automatic generation can flow
forever. Sometimes it appears as maw-machine emissions - text in, modified
text/partial code out. Sometimes it extends language into new uncharted
territories. Sometimes it references the labor and/or processing of
language. Sometimes it privileges the written over the spoken, or portends
the spoken within a convolution of stuttering and close-to-impossible
phonemic combinations. Sometimes it appears as a warning against the all-
too-easy assimilation of linguistic competency.

Sometimes it breaks free, relates to the subjectivity behind its produc-
tion, the subjectivity inherent in every presentation of symbol-symbolic.

The U.S. Needs to Open Up to the World

 To this European, America is trapped in a fortress of arrogance and
ignorance


By BRIAN ENO


Posted Sunday, Jan. 12, 2003; 2.09 p.m. GMT
http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/2003/0120/cover/view_eno.html


Europeans have always looked at America with a mixture of fascination and
puzzlement, and now, increasingly, disbelief. How is it that a country that
prides itself on its economic success could have so many very poor people?
How is it that a country so insistent on the rule of law should seek to
exempt itself from international agreements? And how is it that the world's
beacon of democracy can have elections dominated by wealthy special interest
groups? For me, the question has become: "How can a country that has
produced so much cultural and economic wealth act so dumb?"

I could fill this page with the names of Americans who have influenced,
entertained and educated me. They represent what I admire about America: a
vigorous originality of thought, and a confidence that things can be changed
for the better. That was the America I lived in and enjoyed from 1978 until
1983. That America was an act of faith - the faith that "otherness" was not
threatening but nourishing, the faith that there could be a country big
enough in spirit to welcome and nurture all the diversity the world could
throw at it. But since Sept. 11, that vision has been eclipsed by a
suspicious, introverted America, a country-sized version of that peculiarly
American form of ghetto: the gated community. A gated community is
defensive. Designed to keep the "others" out, it dissolves the rich web of
society into a random clustering of disconnected individuals. It turns
paranoia and isolation into a lifestyle.

Surely this isn't the America that anyone dreamed of; it's a last resort,
nobody's choice. It's especially ironic since so much of the best new
thinking about society, economics, politics and philosophy in the last
century came from America. Unhampered by the snobbery and exclusivity of
much European thought, American thinkers vaulted forward - courageous,
innovative and determined to talk in a public language. But, unfortunately,
over the same period, the mass media vaulted backward, thriving on
increasingly simple stories and trivializing news into something
indistinguishable from entertainment. As a result, a wealth of original and
subtle thought - America's real wealth - is squandered.

This narrowing of the American mind is exacerbated by the withdrawal of the
left from active politics. Virtually ignored by the media, the left has
further marginalized itself by a retreat into introspective cultural
criticism. It seems content to do yoga and gender studies, leaving the
fundamentalist Christian right and the multinationals to do the politics.
The separation of church and state seems to be breaking down too. Political
discourse is now dominated by moralizing, like George W. Bush's promotion of
American "family values" abroad, and dissent is unpatriotic. "You're either
with us or against us" is the kind of cant you'd expect from a zealous
mullah, not an American President.

When Europeans make such criticisms, Americans assume we're envious. "They
want what we've got," the thinking goes, "and if they can't get it, they're
going to stop us from having it." But does everyone want what America has?
Well, we like some of it but could do without the rest: among the highest
rates of violent crime, economic inequality, functional illiteracy,
incarceration and drug use in the developed world. President Bush recently
declared that the U.S. was "the single surviving model of human progress."
Maybe some Americans think this self-evident, but the rest of us see it as a
clumsy arrogance born of ignorance.

Europeans tend to regard free national health services, unemployment
benefits, social housing and so on as pretty good models of human progress.
We think it's important - civilized, in fact - to help people who fall
through society's cracks. This isn't just altruism, but an understanding
that having too many losers in society hurts everyone. It's better for
everybody to have a stake in society than to have a resentful underclass
bent on wrecking things. To many Americans, this sounds like socialism, big
government, the nanny state. But so what? The result is: Europe has less gun
crime and homicide, less poverty and arguably a higher quality of life than
the U.S., which makes a lot of us wonder why America doesn't want some of
what we've got.

Too often, the U.S. presents the "American way" as the only way, insisting
on its kind of free-market Darwinism as the only acceptable "model of human
progress." But isn't civilization what happens when people stop behaving as
if they're trapped in a ruthless Darwinian struggle and start thinking about
communities and shared futures? America as a gated community won't work,
because not even the world's sole superpower can build walls high enough to
shield itself from the intertwined realities of the 21st century. There's a
better form of security: reconnect with the rest of the world, don't shut it
out; stop making enemies and start making friends. Perhaps it's asking a lot
to expect America to act differently from all the other empires in history,
but wasn't that the original idea?

Tahree Lane, my friend and a reporter for the Toledo Blade, is doing a =
story on love letters and called today with several questions. I said =
I'd send them to poets on the Poetics list, so if you're interested in =
responding:=20

      tlane@toledoblade.com.

Has the internet made the love letter passe'?
Is there any difference between a love letter written by hand in pen and =
ink as opposed to email or internet transmissions?=20
Are there more or less love letters than in the pre-internet past?

We discussed paper, textures, people returning to the letters of lost or =
deceased lovers, and the implicit personality of the writer's script.=20

Tahree's story goes to the editor next Monday, to be published in the =
Sunday edition prior to Valentine's Day.

I think there's a distortion here. Creeley didn't do "some years of risk
outside the institution"--that implies that he was on some sort
of  adventure vacation. What happened in fact is that he found a gig, and
good for him and for all the rest who have done so--feeding oneself and
family is a good thing. But poetry thrived for thousands of years without
writing programs, and in most of the world still does. In the small corner
of Mexico that my recent anthology covers, for instance, I had no trouble
gathering 53 poets, all living and writing, all but three below 60. And not
a single University writing course between them.

It's just a gig--the MFA world doesn't help poetry as such, and hopefully
it doesn't do too much damage, altho I think it rather distorts the
acceptance of poetry. But don't kid yourselves that a 22 year old going
through a couple of years of courses will automatically emerge with the
mastery necessary to teach the craft to others. A few will--a very few,
some of whom are on this list--but that's the way it's always been.

further scribbles from the net
there are 7 definitions of "bounding" I found listed:

adj.
Confined by bonds; tied: bound and gagged hostages.
Being under legal or moral obligation: bound by my promise.
Equipped with a cover or binding: bound volumes.
Predetermined; certain: We're bound to be late.
Determined; resolved: She's bound to be mayor.
Linguistics. Being a form, especially a morpheme, that cannot stand as an
independent word, such as a prefix or suffix.
Constipated.

Wow! On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays we paint them khaki with green
helmets and on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday we paint them green with khaki
helmets. Sometimes we paint in eyes and a mouth, but when we're in a hurry
we skip it! I think Mr O puts these in the Podfoot section because they are
the smaller size. They have little feet in little shoes.
They really are cute, I think they might be twins. Ed and Fred! Soldier,
Machine Gunner, Lying Flat is their official title. Their official Vernster
price is $15.00 each one.

It's interesting that there should be all this hoopla over Baraka's
poem. If nothing else, he's using all this free PR for everything it's
worth.

But I'm curious that nobody's noted the parallel analytical line taken
by Clayton Eshleman on the Skanky Possum blog:

http://www.skankypossum.com/pouch/

Rather than rag on Baraka or Eshleman, though, I want to ask what it is
about the current administration that generates such fears & nightmares.

These are not, after all, nearly as crazy as Bush' attempt to yoke Iraq
& al Qaeda into the same problem. I don't hear Reilly or the NJ
legislature demanding Bush' firing.

When you compare the worst of the current administration with those of
Nixon's -- Ashcroft vs. Mitchell, Rumsfeld vs. Kissinger -- you realize
that nothing Nixon did is beyond this current group of clowns. It is
frankly a scary circumstance. There is a difference, though. Nixon was
elected.

... 'lying together, look over your lover, it's the face of the other,
it's the face of an other' ...

Let us take for granted that online and online(offline) sex (as a result
of online sex) are prevalent and transforming, for those who can afford
the proper connections, bandwidth, and time. Let us take for granted as
well that these sexualities occur within a stadium of exhibitionisms,
voyeurisms, seductions, of, and in relation to, others - that there is
almost always a shuddering or splitting of bodies, a shattering of bodies
dividing as a result of intrusions of mass-communications and machine-
mediated perception into what used to be private domains.

Let us further look at the history of personal historical knowledge, the
history of private or personal lives, including ancestors, antecedents,
descendents, traditions of naming, and the naming of others. We might note
that in online or online(offline) sexuality, there is the _absent or
disconnected_ population, the disenfranchised population, the refugee or
hungered populations, the violated populations, who are neither conscious
or operative as such - the miseries of underdevelopment playing a large
role in this. Let us note our own role in these populations, our own
belonging, our own violence as another arm of voluptuousness.

History resides, if anywhere, within the disconnected population; it is
within connectivity and the continuous production of history, that history
itself disconnects. There is reality without reality tv; there is tv with
reality tv. Countries bomb countries they cannot place on a map; no two
people ever speak the same language in the coupling of bodies.

Everything I am saying is a myth, lie, only to point out that online,
online(offline) sexualities don't occur in a vacuum; they're against the
background of others, of the erasure of history and the weakening of
political posturing, of the almost continuous splitting of bodies,
of the introjection and projection - 'jectivity' of others to the extent
that identities are problematic, exchanged/renamed/stolen/intensified -
that the politics in all of this are lost in orgasm, that there's no
turning back, that we're all heading towards fucking armageddon -

It's Worldsex: Do you recognize your own prosthesis? The turmoil of bodies
tends towards no bodies at all; the computer screen is already sexualized
as you can hardly keep your hands on the keys. Eyes float in relation to
proferred images. Perhaps this is already a form of war.

Falling in Love Online (part of an article published in Tamil)

Here you are, happily married, with two children. Your husband has a great
job and you're a little bit bored and so you join some Internet communi-
ties, just to relax. You find yourself chatting away about some recent
novels you've read, and you complain that your husband really doesn't have
much time to read, and isn't all that interested anyway.

Before long, someone starts talking to you; Sagdish tells you that he,
too, reads a lot of novels, but he lives alone and has no one talk to, and
he likes poetry as well. You begin chatting with him more than with anyone
else - before this, you had flitted from conversation to conversation, but
now you find yourself drawn in.

You log in late at night, and every time you do this, your heart skips a
beat, hoping Sagdish will be there, and he usually is. You start talking a
bit more intimately with him - about the fact that you can't really relate
to your husband's business, and you feel lonely every so often, and he
says that he feels lonely too.

One night your husband comes in and finds you typing away at the computer
and he asks, what are you doing? You answer, nothing, just talking to some
people, and for the first time you find yourself hiding something from
your husband - that something is Sagdish. You realize you've crossed a
line somewhere, but you don't feel it's all that serious - after all, it's
only the Internet, and there's nothing to lose or gain - it's just a game,
and Sagdish helps take your loneliness away.

You decide to be more careful when your husband's around - you don't
really want him to question you any more about this. And you look more and
more towards those chats with Sagdish, who is becoming part of your life.
You find yourself exchanging email with him, and you wait nervously every
day for his email and the chats. You begin dreaming about him.

One day he asks what you look like, and you describe yourself, but you
don't have a picture online. He persists, and you say you'll send him one,
an extra one that you just happen to have. You mail it to him when your
husband's not around, and Sagdish puts his picture on the Net, and you go
and look at him, and your dreams begin taking more and more shape.

You find yourself telling Sagdish everything, things you have never told
your husband - things you could never tell him. You find yourself doing
this quickly; all this activity has lasted only a month, and even though
you're usually shy, you're quite aggressive with him. You confess that sex
with your husband hasn't been all that good, and Sagdish asks you the
details.

Somewhere around this time, another line is crossed; you begin writing
sexually to each more, more explicitly than you ever thought possible. You
become more and more nervous around your husband and children, who guess
that something is wrong, and don't know what to do about it. You insist to
yourself that everything is a game, but you won't talk about it to your
family, and you begin to feel isolated in the house.

Your husband confronts you angrily, and demands that you tell him what is
going on. You mention only that you have this friend Sagdish, who helps
take away your loneliness when your husband is at work, and your husband
demands that you stop writing and talking with him online. At first you go
along with this, and don't contact Sagdish for a couple of days. And then
you go back, as usual, almost as if you're addicted to a drug.

Your husband gets angrier and angrier with you, and you don't know what to
do. You write about all of this with Sagdish, who begs to telephone you
and talk about it directly.

One day, Sagdish calls, and you find yourself in love with his voice, and
you talk for over an hour. He calls any number of times after this, always
when your husband is out and another line is crossed. You believe that
Sagdish is the only person who understands you, even though you have never
met him in person. Sagdish fills your dreams and your life.

One day your husband walks in during the day, and you are on the phone.
There is a huge fight, and he walks out, and moves to an apartment in the
vicinity. You are alone with the children, and a few days later, you meet
Sagdish for the first time, in real life.

within connectivity and the continuous production of history, that history
itself disconnects. There is reality without reality tv; there is tv with
reality tv. Countries bomb countries they cannot place on a map; no two
people ever speak the same language in the coupling of bodies.

Everything I am saying is a myth, lie, only to point out that online,
online(offline) sexualities don't occur in a vacuum; they're against the
background of others, of the erasure of history and the weakening of
political posturing, of the almost continuous splitting of bodies,
of the introjection and projection - 'jectivity' of others to the extent
that identities are problematic, exchanged/renamed/stolen/intensified -
that the politics in all of this are lost in orgasm, that there's no
turning back, that we're all heading towards fucking armageddon -

ii

It's Worldsex: Do you recognize your own prosthesis? The turmoil of bodies
tends towards no bodies at all; the computer screen is already sexualized
as you can hardly keep your hands on the keys. Eyes float in relation to
proferred images. Perhaps this is already a form of war.

Falling in Love Online (part of an article published in Tamil, 1999)

Here you are, happily married, with two children. Your husband has a great
job and you're a little bit bored and so you join some Internet communi-
ties, just to relax. You find yourself chatting away about some recent
novels you've read, and you complain that your husband really doesn't have
much time to read, and isn't all that interested anyway.

Before long, someone starts talking to you; Sagdish tells you that he,
too, reads a lot of novels, but he lives alone and has no one talk to, and
he likes poetry as well. You begin chatting with him more than with anyone
else - before this, you had flitted from conversation to conversation, but
now you find yourself drawn in.

You log in late at night, and every time you do this, your heart skips a
beat, hoping Sagdish will be there, and he usually is. You start talking a
bit more intimately with him - about the fact that you can't really relate
to your husband's business, and you feel lonely every so often, and he
says that he feels lonely too.

One night your husband comes in and finds you typing away at the computer
and he asks, what are you doing? You answer, nothing, just talking to some
people, and for the first time you find yourself hiding something from
your husband - that something is Sagdish. You realize you've crossed a
line somewhere, but you don't feel it's all that serious - after all, it's
only the Internet, and there's nothing to lose or gain - it's just a game,
and Sagdish helps take your loneliness away.

You decide to be more careful when your husband's around - you don't
really want him to question you any more about this. And you look more and
more towards those chats with Sagdish, who is becoming part of your life.
You find yourself exchanging email with him, and you wait nervously every
day for his email and the chats. You begin dreaming about him.

One day he asks what you look like, and you describe yourself, but you
don't have a picture online. He persists, and you say you'll send him one,
an extra one that you just happen to have. You mail it to him when your
husband's not around, and Sagdish puts his picture on the Net, and you go
and look at him, and your dreams begin taking more and more shape.

You find yourself telling Sagdish everything, things you have never told
your husband - things you could never tell him. You find yourself doing
this quickly; all this activity has lasted only a month, and even though
you're usually shy, you're quite aggressive with him. You confess that sex
with your husband hasn't been all that good, and Sagdish asks you the
details.

Somewhere around this time, another line is crossed; you begin writing
sexually to each more, more explicitly than you ever thought possible. You
become more and more nervous around your husband and children, who guess
that something is wrong, and don't know what to do about it. You insist to
yourself that everything is a game, but you won't talk about it to your
family, and you begin to feel isolated in the house.

Your husband confronts you angrily, and demands that you tell him what is
going on. You mention only that you have this friend Sagdish, who helps
take away your loneliness when your husband is at work, and your husband
demands that you stop writing and talking with him online. At first you go
along with this, and don't contact Sagdish for a couple of days. And then
you go back, as usual, almost as if you're addicted to a drug.

Your husband gets angrier and angrier with you, and you don't know what to
do. You write about all of this with Sagdish, who begs to telephone you
and talk about it directly.

One day, Sagdish calls, and you find yourself in love with his voice, and
you talk for over an hour. He calls any number of times after this, always
when your husband is out and another line is crossed. You believe that
Sagdish is the only person who understands you, even though you have never
met him in person. Sagdish fills your dreams and your life.

One day your husband walks in during the day, and you are on the phone.
There is a huge fight, and he walks out, and moves to an apartment in the
vicinity. You are alone with the children, and a few days later, you meet
Sagdish for the first time, in real life.

CYBERGRAPHIA
http://cg.bard.edu


       You'll agree that there is more than one kind of poetry in the
       true sense of the word--that is to say, calling something into
       existence that was not there before . . .
       --Diotima in Plato's Symposium

       Everybody is contemporary with his period . . . and the whole
       business of writing is the question of living in that
       contemporariness. . . . The thing that is important is that
       nobody knows what the contemporariness is. In other words, they
       don't know where they are going, but they are on their way.
       --Gertrude Stein, How Writing is Written

   WHAT FOR . . .
   The largest challenge facing Liberal Arts and Sciences
   today is how to deal with the rapidly changing and increasingly
   complex world that all the phenomena under the label globalization
   have created. This world is "multi-" many things: cultural,
   linguistic, ethnic, racial, etc. Over the last few decades, on a
   daily basis, some "we" or another has found itself face to face with
   not the other but with many others, with not one language practice,
   but many. Educating for this world is the most pressing challenge we
   face. CYBERGRAPHIA was begun with the conviction that as education
   is the place where we confront and instruct how to negotiate today's
   world, contemporary writing has much to contribute to this
   discussion. CYBERGRAPHIA, thus, hopes to initiate a web-based
   discussion on the challenges and productive possibilities that arise
   when teaching contemporary writing.

   The website's roots are in a four day conference called "Poetry &
   Pedagogy: The Challenge of the Contemporary," organized by Joan
   Retallack, that the Institute for Writing and Thinking
   <http://www.writingandthinking.org>held in 2000 that concentrated on
   how innovative, thoughtfully performative, and critically aware
   practices of teaching might arise when teaching contemporary writing.

   HOW TO . . .
   Each month for about a year, CYBERGRAPHIA will feature a
   new piece of contemporary writing and a discussion of some possible
   ways to use this writing in the classroom. This is designed to be a
   sort of mini-anthology introduction to the terrain of innovative
   contemporary writing. The site features writing that might be
   overlooked by those new to contemporary writing (much of the work
   featured here appeared in small print runs or in ephemeral
   journals). The emphasis in CYBERGRAPHIA is not on craft or expertise
   or canon formation. These works, ones that might be called "avant
   garde" or "innovative," are featured because they encourage active,
   generative, and speculative thinking; because they stretch or
   reconfigure language in exciting ways. The pedagogical discussion
   that accompanies each featured poem is provisional and always being
   revised. It is presented as just one option, not the only one.
   CYBERGRAPHIA draws heavily from the teaching strategies of the
   Institute for Writing and Thinking
   <http://www.writingandthinking.org>  at Bard College which encourages
   collaborative learning methods in which reading, writing, and
   thinking are active processes. CYBERGRAPHIA encourages registered
   and unregistered users to provide other pedagogical uses through the
   discussion forum. Featured works and pedagogical discussions are
   archived.

****
   FEATURED POEM FOR FEBRUARY: Alice Notley's WHITE PHOSPHORUS.
****

   In addition, CYBERGRAPHIA has a workshop forum and five online
   interactive teaching tools available to registered users. The tools
   are designed for faculty and students to create, collaborate, and
   comment on poetry and prose. The emphasis here is on ease of use.
   Users need only enter text in boxes to submit their writing and
   basic HTML commands can be used in any text box.

   The following tools are available:

       NOTEBOOK: an online version of what composition theorists often
       call the "dialectical notebook" or "double entry notebook." This
       version has three columns. The user who creates the notebook can
       post comments in any column; any registered user can post in any
       of the last two columns and in the discussion forum at the bottom.

       ANNOTATOR: a tool that allows users to create a hypertext of a
       primary work. Registered faculty can enter the primary work and
       then commentary can be added by any registered user line by line.

       PUBLISHER: registered users can post writing which then gets
       "published" as a web page.

       SORTER: registered users enter text by paragraph which is then
       randomly sorted.

       ARCHIVE: faculty can upload files here. All files are freely
       downloadable by registered users.

   Anyone registered as a "faculty" user with CYBERGRAPHIA may create
   and delete their own workshops and group particular student
   notebooks or annotations or web pages, etc., under their workshop.
   Anyone registered as a "student" user may create a notebook,
   annotate a text created by a faculty user, publish a text, or sort
   an essay. Workshop archives, accessible only to the registered
   faculty member and students, are available for at least a year but
   this can be extended by request.

Mark,

I think there's distortion here too.  I don't agree that poetry
"thrives" throughout the world, with or without
writing programs. If poetry thrives, what does music do: bust a gut?
It's also a distortion to imply that writing courses, take them or leave
them, are universal.  They're not.  For example, you don't make it clear
whether your Mexican poets didn't take writing courses because they
chose not to, or because there weren't any to take. I find your comment
"feeding oneself and family is a good thing" trite, likewise your
comment about the simultaneously innocuous and distorting influence of
MFA programs. You appeal twice to antiquity:

"But poetry thrived for thousands of years without writing programs,"

and

"don't kid yourselves that a 22 year old going through a couple of years
of courses will automatically emerge with the mastery necessary to teach
the craft to others. A few will--a very few, some of whom are on this
list--but that's the way it's always been."

A few points:  There are many significant differences between poetry in
the United States now and
the distant past, general literacy, print culture, and the participation
of women being only three.  In view of your bland confidence in the
past, I am not surprised at your equally bland claim that out of the
"very few" graduates with "the mastery necessary to teach the craft to
others," "some of whom are," happily enough, "on this list."  You might
also consider, however, that the necessary "mastery" may relate to
pedagogy rather than poetry or poetics.

I think there's a distortion here. Creeley didn't do "some years of risk
outside the institution"--that implies that he was on some sort
of  adventure vacation. What happened in fact is that he found a gig,
and
good for him and for all the rest who have done so--feeding oneself and
family is a good thing. But poetry thrived for thousands of years
without
writing programs, and in most of the world still does. In the small
corner
of Mexico that my recent anthology covers, for instance, I had no
trouble
gathering 53 poets, all living and writing, all but three below 60. And
not
a single University writing course between them.

It's just a gig--the MFA world doesn't help poetry as such, and
hopefully
it doesn't do too much damage, altho I think it rather distorts the
acceptance of poetry. But don't kid yourselves that a 22 year old going
through a couple of years of courses will automatically emerge with the
mastery necessary to teach the craft to others. A few will--a very few,
some of whom are on this list--but that's the way it's always been.

frank, you're right about the left abandoning the rural, for the most
part (and often, worse, rural poverty)... all's you have to do is
spend some time driving around the less populated regions of the
midwest to know that about the only consistent voice on the radio is
rush limbaugh's (we could tune in rush w/o break during some rather
extensive driving we did two summers ago around north and south
dakota)... what maria says about minnesota is dead-on (wisconsin
ain't so bad either), but i can count the leftists i know personally
who give a shit about the family farm on one hand... and the (most)
popular music that appeals to so many in these swaths of the
u.s.---country & western (more or less of each)---also takes a
hammering by the urban left, as a rule (granted, some of the
hammering is deserved, but not all)... when i mention that we watch
the opry on saturday nights, i get weird stares---am i getting these
now, here?---and feel i have to defend that choice (and yeah, i'm
sensitive to the relative absence there of women musicians, and
people of color, etc.)...

this is one reason why i/we always contribute to farm aid... no
doubt, too, that inattention to the deplorable rural situation has
helped feed militia movements in the u.s...

can i fess up here?... one reason why i know anything at all about
this is b/c my wife and partner (kass fleisher) put herself through
grad school teaching c & w line dancing... this is in *ny
state*---southern tier... and in what some of us central nyers used
to call the boonies, again, c & w is among the most listened-to of
pop music...

anyway, as i see it, another thing the left ought to devote more
collective thought to...

best,

joe

Interesting too Joe, that it's the outlaw shitkickers in country music who should be embraced by the left.

Johnny Cash reached out to understand the peace movement in the 1960's. He talked w/ anti-war activists about Vietnam. He went to Southeast Asia to perform for the soldiers & came to the conclusion that they needed to come home (see "Singin' in Vietnam Talkin' Blues). He mourns for the poor & beaten down, those that can't read, the ex-con who's treated less than human, those sent off to war (see "The Man in Black"). He put a light on the disgrace of Native American discrimination, & the devastating effects of racism (see "The Ballad of Ira Hayes").

Willie Nelson took Charlie Pride on tour w/ him in the 1960's. In Alabama, Pride was getting hit w/ beer bottles & the "N" bomb onstage. Nelson came from backstage, grabbed Pride's face & kissed him on the lips. Nelson walked offstage. Pride finished his set before a confused & quiet crowd. The consensus: If he's alright w/ Willie, he's alright w/ me.

Nelson started Farm Aid to presrve the family farm. When the IRS auctioned his ranch, a group of Texas farmers who'd received "farm aid" in the past, bought Nelson's property & told him he should continue to live there & pay them back whenever he was in the black again. That's the kind of community some leftists have only dreamed about.

Willie Nelson has been a longtime advocate for justice for Native Americans, & supported the push for clemency for Leonard Peltier.

(And for you stoners out there, he also smoked weed on the roof of the White House. It wasn't during Clinton's reign. That would be too obvious. He did it before it was cool to have a pothead in the presidential palace, way back during the Carter administration.)

Cash & Nelson did these things because they thought it was the right thing to do. Certainly, they didn't take these stands to win over their audience like say, a Jefferson Airplane might have been required to do. In many cases, I'm sure they alienated a good number of good ol' boys. They walked the walk. And if that's outlaw, that's where we should be looking.

The culprit, I believe, is a former Dean of Graduate studies for the
University of Iowa who, in 1922 or so, announced that creative theses
(poetry, fiction) would thereafter be accepted as degree fulfillment in place
of the scholarly dissertation.  At first, only a few universities followed
his lead.  But eventually the flood gates opened, and Creative Writing
programs became the norm.  The result, of course, is that we are now up to
our ears in professional poets whose talents and "styles" are often sanitized
by the institutional experience.  So all kudos to anyone who manages an
individual voice.  Best, Bill

End and The Manner_ and Habib Tengour’s _The Old Man of the Mountain_.


The first English translations of these unconventional works,
by four seemingly divergent authors, come together in _4X1_—redefining
inherited assumptions regarding Modernism, Dadaism, Surrealism
and Postmodernism.  Pierre Joris’s translations of Tzara, Rilke,
Duprey and Tengour create “a psycho-topography that leads from
matters involving late 19th century colonialism all the way through
the long and torturous 20th century to leave us exactly there
where we have to start to actively imagine a new cultural constellation”(From
Joris’s Translator’s Introduction).  _4X1_ also features artwork
by Nicole Peyrafitte, which works in concert with the selections
shaping an image of the twentieth century that moves toward a
nomadic poetics in a world organized without boundaries.

> Harold Pinter's speech on receiving an Honorary Doctorate from the
University
> of Turin.
>
"I am deeply honoured to receive this degree from such a great
university.

Earlier this year I had a major operation for cancer. The operation and
its
after-effects were something of a nightmare. I felt I was a man unable
to
swim bobbing about under water in a deep dark endless ocean. But I did
not
drown and I am very glad to be alive. However, I found that to emerge
from a
personal nightmare was to enter an infinitely more pervasive public
nightmare - the nightmare of American hysteria, ignorance, arrogance,
stupidity and belligerence; the most powerful nation the world has ever
known effectively waging war against the rest of the world. "If you are
not
with us you are against us" President Bush has said. He has also said
"We
will not allow the world's worst weapons to remain in the hands of the
world's worst leaders". Quite right. Look in the mirror chum. That's
you.

The US is at this moment developing advanced systems of "weapons of mass
destruction" and it prepared to use them where it sees fit. It has more
of
them than the rest of the world put together. It has walked away from
international agreements on biological and chemical weapons, refusing to
allow inspection of its own factories. The hypocrisy behind its public
declarations and its own actions is almost a joke.

The United States believes that the three thousand deaths in New York
are
the only deaths that count, the only deaths that matter. They are
American
deaths. Other deaths are unreal, abstract, of no consequence.

The three thousand deaths in Afghanistan are never referred to.

The hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children dead through US and British
sanctions which have deprived them of essential medicines are never
referred
to.

The effect of depleted uranium, used by America in the Gulf War, is
never
referred to. Radiation levels in Iraq are appallingly high. Babies are
born
with no brain, no eyes, no genitals. Where they do have ears, mouths or
rectums, all that issues from these orifices is blood.

The two hundred thousand deaths in East Timor in 1975 brought about by
the
Indonesian government but inspired and supported by the United States
are
never referred to.

The half a million deaths in Guatemala, Chile, El Salvador, Nicaragua,
Uruguay, Argentina and Haiti, in actions supported and subsidised by the
United States are never referred to.

The millions of deaths in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are no longer
referred
to.

The desperate plight of the Palestinian people, the central factor in
world
unrest, is hardly referred to.

But what a misjudgement of the present and what a misreading of history
this
is.

People do not forget. They do not forget the death of their fellows,
they do
not forget torture and mutilation, they do not forget injustice, they do
not
forget oppression, they do not forget the terrorism of mighty powers.
They
not only don't forget. They strike back.

The atrocity in New York was predictable and inevitable. It was an act
of
retaliation against constant and systematic manifestations of state
terrorism on the part of the United States over many years, in all parts
of
the world.

In Britain the public is now being warned to be "vigilant" in
preparation
for potential terrorist acts. The language is in itself preposterous.

How will - or can - public vigilance be embodied? Wearing a scarf over
your
mouth to keep out poison gas? However, terrorist attacks are quite
likely,
the inevitable result of our Prime Minister's contemptible and shameful
subservience to the United States. Apparently a terrorist poison gas
attack
on the London Underground system was recently prevented. But such an act
may
indeed take place. Thousands of school children travel on the London
Underground every day. If there is a poison gas attack from which they
die,
the responsibility will rest entirely on the shoulders of our Prime
Minister. Needless to say, the Prime Minister does not travel on the
underground himself.

The planned war against Iraq is in fact a plan for premeditated murder
of
thousands of civilians in order, apparently, to rescue them from their
dictator.

The United States and Britain are pursuing a course which can lead only
to
an escalation of violence throughout the world and finally to
catastrophe.

It is obvious, however, that the United States is bursting at the seams
to
attack Iraq. I believe that it will do this - not just to take control
of
Iraqi oil - but because the US administration is now a bloodthirsty wild
animal. Bombs are its only vocabulary. Many Americans, we know, are
horrified by the posture of their government but seem to be helpless.

Unless Europe finds the solidarity, intelligence, courage and will to
challenge and resist US power Europe itself will deserve Alexander
Herzen's
definition (as quoted in the Guardian newspaper in London recently) "We
are
not the doctors. We are the disease".

Very few countries have writing programs. Mexico is not one of them. For
those who want them, what they have instead, aside from the informal
networks that have traditionally nourished young poets, is a very loose
system of weekly workshops, some of which meet at universities, most not.
Attendance is informal, altho a core of members may remain for years.
Membership is usually multigenerational. Often the workshop leader is
unpaid, and if paid it's barely enough for a beer, and more often than not
there is no fee for participants. Even this degree of formal instruction is
rare in the world at large.

"Thrived" means in this context "there were lots of poets. " For thousands
of years" is not about antiquity, it includes the present. But let's not
forget how recent MFA-less antiquity is. Very few poets of my generation,
and none of those who are important to me of the previous, were MFAs--there
simply weren't a lot of programs. And I suspect that the emergence of women
poets has more to do with hard-won social changes than with MFA programs.

As to your rhetorical linking of two statements, the first a misreading,
I'm not sure why an expressed  taste for, say, Sappho or Rimbaud or Emily
Dickinson or Creeley, among the ancients, has much to do with my assumption
about the artistic maturity of very young writers.

I simply don't understand your last sentence. Are you saying that very
young MFAs may know how to teach the craft because they've learned craft
and pedagogy in school? That's a pretty frightening thought. What, in that
case, would they have to pass on but the standard wisdom of whatever alma
maters?

As it happens, I've taught a few poetry workshops at universities. Usually
it's a joy, and good for me as poet and teacher. And it's a gig. Of course
I was a much older and more practiced poet when I did so, with a lot more
"years of risk" behind me. I like to think my courses were good for my
students, but I don't pretend that very many of them will become
interesting poets because of them. Altho the classroom is often a part of
it, the curriculum that sometimes produces poets is rather more informal
(not to say haphazard) than the classroom. The starting-place is the
impulse to write, and that must precede undergraduate course selection in
most cases, and certainly precedes application to MFA programs. That
impulse and what follows from it, the seeking out of other poets and
poetry, has always, in the ancient times that persist in most places,
produced a plethora of poets.

I make the bland assumption that it's a positive good for most people who
who haven't inherited wealth to have jobs that put food on the table.

We can argue about this further at AWP, where I'll be selling books at
table 83.

Okey-doke.  It'll be good to meet you.  To clarify the final point of my
letter: You say --

"But don't kid yourselves that a 22 year old going
through a couple of years of courses will automatically emerge with the
mastery necessary to teach the craft to others. A few will--a very few,
some of whom are on this list--but that's the way it's always been."

I say, "In view of your bland confidence in the
past, I am not surprised at your equally bland claim that out of the
'very few' graduates with 'the mastery necessary to teach the craft to
others,' 'some of whom are,' happily enough, 'on this list.'  You might
also consider, however, that the necessary 'mastery' may relate to
pedagogy rather than poetry or poetics."

A pretty clumpy-looking sentence intended to mean:

1)You seem to imply that the 'mastery necessary to teach the craft to
others' is the mastery of the craft itself.

2) I offer the counter point that perhaps pedagogical 'mastery' is as
important in teaching the 'craft' to others as mastery of the craft
itself
(although I would not myself choose the term "mastery" to describe the
ongoing adventures of writing and teaching).

3) I find it a little ludicrous that, having decimated graduates to
"very few" masters, you identify some of them as being on this list.

4) My general tone of annoyance relates to my bad humor today and
impatience at your final comment: "but that's the way it's always been."
 The gear and tackle and trim of writing poetry -- its economy,
institutionalization, and hardware -- is particular to our time and
culture.  Maybe you mean that what is constant is the emergence of the
"few" "masters": that poetry is always an elite of mastery.  Is that
what you're saying?

Mairead



I simply don't understand your last sentence. Are you saying that very
young MFAs may know how to teach the craft because they've learned craft
and pedagogy in school? That's a pretty frightening thought. What, in
that
case, would they have to pass on but the standard wisdom of whatever

Thanks for posting the Pinter, Peter. Morning news does suggest the
Administration is beginning to blink - seriously considering "extending the
inspections." Other than  blindly going forward, they have no one among the
top nations in their corner. Plus the stock market is diving way way down -
already 210 points today - and about 500 for the week. Obviously investors
are not taking much stock in Bush's agenda to deliver tax free dividends!
Public protest (60 to 30% against a non-UN backed invasion) combined with
folks voting with their wallets is making Bush and Co slide down the flag
pole.
On one hand I know this sounds optimistic. But the other dreadful fact is
that even with this blink, these folks still have two years to trash "the
palace" to please their base - it's going to take continued vigilance on all
counts - civil rights, environmental, education, etc. etc.

Has the internet made the love letter passe'?
Is there any difference between a love letter written by hand in pen and =
ink as opposed to email or internet transmissions?=20
Are there more or less love letters than in the pre-internet past?

We discussed paper, textures, people returning to the letters of lost or =

In the Jan. 24, 03 issue of "The Chronicle Review," the magazine insert of
"The Chronicle of Higher Education," there's an article by Fern Kupfer (a
novelist) on MFA programs called "The Dream, and the Reality, of Writing
Fiction."  I don't know if it's on line, but people may find it
interesting.  She regards MFA programs as a kind of pyramid scheme:
"writers become teachers and teach other writers, who become teachers in
turn," and there are not enough jobs to go around.  Kupfer is somewhat
reserved about the advantages of MFA programs, and ends her article:

"Most students leave my courses with a deeper understanding of the writer's
craft.  Some learn to see the world with a writer's eye.  And a few even
produce wonderful stories.  They have a good time and get their money's
worth.  But I warn anyone who wants to be a writer: Better get yourself a
good day job.  Because I'm not ready to give up mine."

mairead, mark, others---

as this is among my very favorite topics, i'll try not to go on, but:

the point mairead is making about the institutionally and
historically specific site of poetry today, on the north american
continent, is to the point... granted, we can find places in the
world where poetry is practiced w/o much reference to educational
realities (though i'd want to know more, mark, about the educational
backgrounds of the poets to whom you make reference)...

but for better and worse, u.s. poetry has become more and more a
matter of formal education... not simply postsecondary---hell, look
at what's going on K-12 (and where are THOSE teachers being
taught?)... this is a legislated reality, here in the states... also,
have a look at the 20th century u.s. poets most of us on this list
consider to have had major impact on u.s. poetry---many, if not most,
hold baccalaureates, a goodly number hold graduate degrees... the
vast majority graduated from high school... kenneth burke types are
few and far between...

so you won't convince this educator that formal education can be set
aside in this discussion---if anything, on the less-than-salutary,
turboprofessionalized side, formal education is an *overdetermining*
factor in the production of poetry (hence as such, can't, again, be
wished away)... it's surely not the be-all and end-all of talking
about a "career" in writing---by which i don't mean to suggest that
"calling" is, either... and i haven't even begun to scratch the
surface here of what's wrong with creative writing as an institution
(i'm with mairead in thinking that we ought to be thinking more about
pedagogy, by which i don't mean which texts are being "taught" in the
classroom)... and i haven't even begun to scratch the surface here of
how that fraught term, literacy, has much to do with all of this...

out for now, enjoying the exchange---

best,

joe

hazel larsen archer :
photographer at black mountain college


january 24 - march1
gallery hours 12 - 6, tue.- sat

"trimming of this photo is forbidden"

The words above, written on the back of the many photographs by Hazel
Larsen Archer (1921-2001) triggered the curiosity and conception that
lies at the basis of this exhibition.

Hazel Larsen Archer was first a student and then a teacher at Black
Mountain College, spending a total of 9 years at this exceptional
experiment in art education.

Most of the photographs in this exhibition date from the year 1948. Mary
Emma Harris writes, "the summer of 1948, organized by Albers, was a
magical one. It marked the end of the dominance of the European artists
at the college and the emergence of the young Americans, who were to be
the creative leaders in the arts in the United States for the next
twenty-five years." This show indeed documents the faces of the young
Cunningham, the young Cage, de Kooning, Ruth Asawa, Dorothea Rockburne,
Sue Weil, Bob Rauschenberg and Ray Johnson.

On view are also portraits of Josef and Annie Albers, Charles Olson and
Buckminster Fuller, photographs of the environment of Black Mountain
College, of the doors of the Quiet House, as well as her sun-prints, her
photographic version of the "Matiere Studies" that all students made in
the classes of the Albers'.

Roland Barthes pointed out that one of the qualities of photography is a
"Dagewesen Sein" - a "having been there" - a notion that relates to the
documentary value of photography. Of course, Archer's photographs show
that she


has been there, and all of the exhibited photographs have a documentary
value, as does every photograph, but in this show we wish to present
Archer as a photographer in the tradition of Alfred Stieglitz, whose
work she admired so much.

About her portrait photography Archer said, "I do not flatter, I do not
retouch, I am interested in my subjects as individuals". And look how
she sees the back of Ray Johnson's head, or the top of John Cage's face,
a photograph that makes him "this good looking Frankenstein". Then there
are the photographic sequences of the dancing Merce Cunningham, where
each photograph appears to be a still photograph from a film with Merce
flying out of the frame as a black angel. Archer's photographs fully
grasp Merce's interest in dance as "movement in time, rather than
poses".

All aesthetic possibilities are explored. Larsen Archer plays with depth
of field in a photograph of Sue Weil, her face protruding as if we are
looking at a holographic portrait. In the double portrait of the
historians of photography Nancy and Beaumont Newhall, we see her play
with perspective and depth of field, a choreography of points of view
rarely seen before.

Archer's photos have been published for their documentary value, and are
known, though often without her being credited. This is the first time
that attention has been given to the photographic qualities of Archer's
work, to the aesthetic qualities that show us the work of an
accomplished artistic visionary that reflect the creative energy of
Black Mountain College.

with our thanks to james s. jaffe rare books for assistance with this
exhibition.

From the N.Y. Times, 22 Jan.:

"Administration officials said their strategy was based on
the belief that there might never be a 'smoking gun'
proving Iraq's possession of illegal weapons. Accordingly,
they acknowledged that the case must be made in a negative
fashion: that Iraq has failed to disprove the contentions
of the United States and others about its weapons of mass
destruction. The administration asserts, without offering
evidence, that Iraq has thwarted inspectors by hiding the
weapons."

UNMOVIC press briefing (excerpts), 20 Jan.:

"1. Access has been obtained to all sites. This will
continue. The Iraqi side will encourage persons to accept
access also to private sites.
2. There has been helpful assistance in the logistic
build-up of the inspection infrastructure, e.g at the Mosul
office. This will continue, e.g regarding a field office in
Basrah.
3. After the find of some empty 122mm chemical munitions at
Al Ukhaidhir stores, the Iraqi side has appointed a team to
undertake an investigation and comprehensive search to look
for similar cases at all locations. One find of four more
units was already reported at Al Taji munitions stores. The
final results will be reported.
[...]
6. The declaration given on 7 December by Iraq was
discussed. Iraq expressed a readiness to respond to
questions raised in connection with the declaration and
discuss such questions.
[...]
9. Iraq will enact national legislation as soon as possible
regarding proscribed activities.
10. Iraq agreed to continue technical discussions with the
IAEA to clarify issues, regarding aluminum tubes, alleged
uranium importation and the use of high explosives, as well
as other outstanding issues."

i frankly don't get the fascination with this thread. why are people getting
so worked up? it's like "american idol" for poets.

this friend of mine not only went for the M.A. (in the days when MFAs were
still somewhat rare), but then went on to the still rarer PHD in writing
(!!!). he thought of it as a sort of "minor league" of being a writer, with
the notion that he would hone his craft, make contacts, and try to "catch
on" with a big publisher and a good university afterwards. i don't know at
what point teaching became a part of the equation of being a writer, but
somewhere along the way it did.

now he's a writing prof at a small school in the midwest, and with phd
firmly in place, he's securely on the tenure track. not sure what happened
to his novel, but i do believe that he worked very hard on his writing while
in the program, so in that sense it must have been good for him.

as for me, i've flirted several times with the mfa siren, only to lash
myself to the mast and pass on by. i attended naropa summer school this past
year and it raised my interest again, but again, i don't think i'll follow
through. i loved the program and the energy of the other students and
learned at least as much from them as from the profs -- and had a pretty
damn good time while i was there. for me, though, there is absolutely no
desire to teach at the university level or to make a "career" of any sort
whatsoever out of poetry. i hate the word career and have never held a job
in my adult life more than three or four years in a row. i just want to
write! and that's the first concern of mine in any program. if i knew i
could go and concentrate on writing for two, three years, and emerge without
the kind of debilitating debt most of my mfa'd friends have, i'd do it in a
minute. but as it is, i'm studying with a great mentor at a very reasonable
rate here in SF. i have many friends around me who take writing seriously.

a part of me wants to say, "if you want to write, you'll write," no matter
what some professor in an MFA program says to discourage you. but of course
i know many who have been discouraged, and it's a shame. My PHD friend told
me a story of a very well known writer/prof (who shall remain nameless)
wiping his ass in class with a student's work to show what he thought of it.
i wonder what happened to that student!!! and i wonder if a small part of my
avoiding the mfa scene is not wanting to risk my own poet-ego in that kind
of competitive, potentially damaging environment. but for now, i slog on,
degreeless in SF.

the idea of "prestige of a large program" is interesting.  the idea of "a
large program" seems more of a marketing tool to convince applicants that
"large" is prestigious, when really "large" is about the numbers, the money,
which has created the industrial complex universities have become today.  i
guess the real prestigious would shoot for tighter numbers, difficult
standards.

but frankly (i can't believe i'm about to defend the bastards out there
making education about making money and little else) i PREFER this "large
program" to the idea of "More selectivity".  of course, i'm acting as if
there are only two choices.  well, the third choice being mine:  not to go
in the first place.  but really, what's with the selectivity, i mean, don't
you like the idea of AS MANY people as possible getting an education in
poetry if that's what they want?  i certainly do.  and what EXACTLY is this
"selectivity" about?  will the selection process in mind be open to more
than just white, white, white, and white?  i'm talking about qualifications,
testing, the way things are presented and required for admissions.  the idea
of the "large" can always include the smaller inside itself, but almost
never the other way around.  anyway, if this can be done, how do you do
that?  how do you also create a selection process with room enough for
working class and poor poets who are serious about making this a choice for
their future?  this idea of "selectivity" is sort of weird to me, elitist.
this is the way of all class divisions.  you create standards to keep the
riff raff out, then pretty soon the pigs that run this world buy their kid a
ticket in past all the qualifications, and everything is polarized all over
again, despite what you may or may not have had in mind at the outset.

so my next point is the "much greater chance of career success."  hmm.
well, this goes back to the origin of this particular tree of e-mails with
the original subject line "poetry careerists."  could you, or someone,
please explain "career success" in the world of poetry?  maybe this sounds
like a naive question, but i can't really comprehend poetry as a career.  to
me, one of the FEW reasons i liked the idea of MFA programs for writing (i
started to rationalize all this when friends starting joining programs) is
that they really seemed to be about education, about people REALLY investing
their lives in poetry, and writing it.  the idea of it merely being another
set of "higher education" courses to gear you into some sort of "career"
just doesn't make sense to me with poetry.  am i going to have to hate MFA
programs again?  i don't know, i really don't want to, but, it's so
disturbing all of a sudden.  maybe i just haven't met anyone who has ever
DONE anything (in that American sense, the get-a-job sense) with their MFA
in creative writing.  my friends with such degrees have jobs that have
nothing at all to do with poetry.  so what is the prize?  i'm assuming there
is one, or two prizes, with this line "much greater chance of career
success."

MAN ALIVE!  can't this instead be PART of making poetry MORE available to as
many people as possible?  do you have ANY IDEA AT ALL what it's like for
people who have DREAMT about writing but NEVER had the encouragement, never

dying of cancer, and over the christmas holiday she told me her "secret" how
she ALWAYS wanted to write short stories, but came from a poor family, where
she was expected to work as soon as she was able to do so, then raise kids,
etc.  it broke my heart to hear this!  and it makes me want to VOMIT

people from their dreams of writing!  i want to get my ass in the laboratory

right, well, i've never been to school for writing, but if folks want to get degrees, that's really no one's business.

naropa always seemed like the best choice for me, though i never went there either.  if Black Mountain had hung on, maybe there, but would it really be the same half a century later?

but i do get worked up about it, people wanting to do something they FEEL is going to take them into this idea they've projected is a great thing, it's beautiful, and i support it.  i've had problems in the past, trying to support friends who went that route.  but it was growing experience i suppose.

but it's easy for you to say that if you're going to write you're going to write.  i write all the time.  but i've created, and have been lucky enough to be ABLE to create this for myself.  but i think about all the people who want to but really canNOT.  trust me, there are PLENTY of folks out there who life has placed all kinds of struggles in the way of doing the creative things they want.

i'm wanting everyone to have the space they need.  we're so lucky, those of us who have the time, space, whatever it is we have to do what we want with our creative energy!

but at the same time things really are moving in a direction where more people than ever are taking to their creative drive.

the fact there are thousands and thousands of writing students and art students is wonderful!  that much creative discovery can only make way for some powerful changes ahead!

Hi,
I've been working on an interactive poem for a while now with a web
programmer (a very old version is on my page at the epc). We're about ready
to launch it but still working out the kinks. Please check out this link
and tell me how it's working for you. We're trying to make sure that people
aren't confused about what they can do at the site, as well as trying to
figure which platforms and browser versions aren't happy with it.
If you could back-channel any feedback to me at josman@temple.edu I'd very
much appreciate it. Please let me know what platform you're working from,
what browser you're using, and what version of that browser.

Hi Jena,

I checked this out- it reminds me of poems in _The Character_, I wonder if
this concept started there? Or web idea overlapped with book idea? I made
some poems, centrifuge and dissolve recombined words and images, but the
other three- stir, heat and dilute destroyed the words, recombined letters,
etc. If this is what you want, it's working, if not, that's what happened
with me. I am using MS Internet Explorer  windows xp

Things stick, split like static electricity. My hair's blown off my body
for motors, electric relays, turned carbon and sufficient electricity for
a central server. There's no reason why the electric motor harnessed
magnetic lines of flux, rotation. Switches going down as "rolling shutdown

saving mode and so electricity for what purposes? For the moment of
electrical energy. Looking, the light is always fading, I'd like to run

(Alright, so it's not quite dead yet, but maybe some analysis will help to ease it off of life support.)

In the U.S., poetry's academic professionalization began in the 1960s.  It was an outcome of the growth of American universities to accommodate the baby boom.  It was thus also an outcome of U.S. global dominance after the war, and all that that entailed.

What is interesting is that the boomers (unlike the present generation) did have alternative, non-academic models of literary vocation: they could look at the examples of all those 1940s and 1950s poets who in the 1960s finally achieved wide readerships.  Perhaps those examples were too intimidating.  Most of the boomers went where the soft job opportunities were.

In a way, Language writing represented the apotheosis and final burn-out of the typical boomer poetic career: Language writers got academic credentials in order to enter the profession, and, once there, tried to discipline or delegitimate other members of the profession for not conforming sufficiently to the dominant institutional discourse -- theory.  Professions need to police themselves in this way in order to maintain credibility (just as the AMA needs to keep out the quacks and faith healers, poetry careerists must look askance at -- while of course being secretly fascinated by -- non-careerists, bohemians, drunks, etc [note the Language poets' fascination with Jack Spicer]).  What happened with Language writing, of course, was just its absorption as one among many acceptable style-clusters of writing.  I note that Susan Howe will appear on an AWP panel.  So much for literary antinomianism.

The growth of interest in "experimental" poetry is a consequence of poetry's academic professionalization.  A good consequence, yes, but nevertheless a consequence, a product, not some spontaneous unveiling of the paratactic sublime.  At least we won't have to sit through the spectacle of another "avant-garde's" attempt to solicit the attentions of college professors brought up on Derrida.  Poets can now write as weirdly as they want to without moralizing that desire by claiming to be engaged in some sort of liberating collaborative project with the reader -- a claim that was in any case always an attempt to woo academic readers and secure professional currency.

And my sense is that even the most calculating academic careerists want their students to pursue a different path.  Though they may work for programs and graduate departments that crank out young professionals, I don't think they really want to see themselves reproduced.  It is always a little pathetic when undergraduates call for more Creative Writing courses, since what their professors would really like to see is the students going off and forming their own writing communities.  Freud thought that the death instinct manifested as a repetition compulsion.  Professions are based on repetition: doing what others have done before so as to secure one's own little niche.  I think the secret wish of many in the profession is that younger poets will opt out.

This talk of the left's abandonment of the farmer moves me to make an
entirely illiberal observation about the urban/rural divide in the US which
may resonate w/ other list members. It's to point out that our coastal
cities and college towns are full of people who grew up actively persecuted
for exceeding the narrow tolerance of their small farming communities, for
any number of deviances from the gossipy, provincial, often fundamentalist
Christian habitus that often prevails there, and whose sole consolation was
the hope of one day moving to an urban center where they might find the
support and guidance and nightclubs that their home town was unable to
offer. You can say that the rural US has been abandoned by liberals (call
them "urban cultural elites" if you like), but don't forget to ask why LRSN

The two-message limit makes discussion on the list almost impossible. So
here, with some second thoughts about even bothering so much after the
fact, are a few clarifications. The numbers refer to Mairead's numbered
statements.


#4: You got my meaning. Many are called, few are chosen. Does anyone think
this is a democratic process?

#1 and #2: I don't think one can know what one has to teach until one has
one's chops, which of course evolve through time. There isn't much of an
abstractable toolkit, and the toolkit is barely the beginning--all of it
follows from practice. It's learn as you go, for teachers and students.

#3: Forget masters, call them poets. A minority, always, of those who so
designate themselves. I'm thank god not in the business of deciding, except
for personal use, who those are, but I know a few on the list among the
larger number whose work I don't know. I don't know why that's ludicrous,
but if it gives you pleasure (ludus=game), that's fine by me.

Okey-doke.  It'll be good to meet you.  To clarify the final point of my
letter: You say --

"But don't kid yourselves that a 22 year old going
through a couple of years of courses will automatically emerge with the
mastery necessary to teach the craft to others. A few will--a very few,
some of whom are on this list--but that's the way it's always been."

I say, "In view of your bland confidence in the
past, I am not surprised at your equally bland claim that out of the
'very few' graduates with 'the mastery necessary to teach the craft to
others,' 'some of whom are,' happily enough, 'on this list.'  You might
also consider, however, that the necessary 'mastery' may relate to
pedagogy rather than poetry or poetics."

A pretty clumpy-looking sentence intended to mean:

1)You seem to imply that the 'mastery necessary to teach the craft to
others' is the mastery of the craft itself.

2) I offer the counter point that perhaps pedagogical 'mastery' is as
important in teaching the 'craft' to others as mastery of the craft
itself
(although I would not myself choose the term "mastery" to describe the
ongoing adventures of writing and teaching).

3) I find it a little ludicrous that, having decimated graduates to
"very few" masters, you identify some of them as being on this list.

4) My general tone of annoyance relates to my bad humor today and
impatience at your final comment: "but that's the way it's always been."
  The gear and tackle and trim of writing poetry -- its economy,
institutionalization, and hardware -- is particular to our time and
culture.  Maybe you mean that what is constant is the emergence of the
"few" "masters": that poetry is always an elite of mastery.  Is that
what you're saying?

Mairead



I simply don't understand your last sentence. Are you saying that very
young MFAs may know how to teach the craft because they've learned craft
and pedagogy in school? That's a pretty frightening thought. What, in
that
case, would they have to pass on but the standard wisdom of whatever
alma
maters?

As it happens, I've taught a few poetry workshops at universities.
Usually
it's a joy, and good for me as poet and teacher. And it's a gig. Of
course
I was a much older and more practiced poet when I did so, with a lot
more
"years of risk" behind me. I like to think my courses were good for my
students, but I don't pretend that very many of them will become
interesting poets because of them. Altho the classroom is often a part
of
it, the curriculum that sometimes produces poets is rather more informal
(not to say haphazard) than the classroom. The starting-place is the
impulse to write, and that must precede undergraduate course selection
in
most cases, and certainly precedes application to MFA programs. That
impulse and what follows from it, the seeking out of other poets and
poetry, has always, in the ancient times that persist in most places,
produced a plethora of poets.

I make the bland assumption that it's a positive good for most people
who
who haven't inherited wealth to have jobs that put food on the table.

We can argue about this further at AWP, where I'll be selling books at
table 83.

Goodmorning All--

At the moment i am writing a thesis on some selected poetry by Robert
Creeley - mainly my aim is to do a phenomenological study of some of his
work. And i was just wondering if any of you could recommend some secondary
material ON Creeley's work, or even essays by Creeley on poetry and such,
which you have found intresting - really anything would be of interest  --

Greatfully,
Saneh

david, of course what you say is quite true...

but b/c the coastal areas (population centers, and maximum wealth
centers, btw) are attractive to ideologically- and landlocked
hinterlanders -- and i should again mention that you can find such
conservative ideology in coastal *states* (which means that residents
of oswego ny, too, might "escape" same by relocating to nyc) --
doesn't mean that everything represented by the rural is necessarily
"bad" (and you didn't say so, i know)... as i posted frank (sherlock)
backchan, i *do* take e.g. meridel le sueur's critique of harsh
midwestern realities to heart...

but my problem has to do with wishing that the entire u.s. would only
look e.g. like my beloved big apple... in terms of the mix of people,
why not, sure... but i like the mountains, and i like the backwoods,
and i can understand someone liking the farm... or to say it another
way, i like the natural, the pastoral, etc., and i can understand
someone wanting to live off the land (and i DON'T like what i see
happening to same, e.g., here in the rockies, where something of a
theme park mentality sets in wrt the natural; and i DON'T like
agribusiness)... hell, i like the absence of chi-chi sometimes...
sometimes, the constant attention to the best restaurant or the best
loft or the best exhibit gives me an ass-ache, and i long for more
rustic fare... if you know what i mean...

i can quite easily understand, too, again, why folks would want to
leave the intolerance of so many of the rural areas in the u.s... and
rural poverty, for that matter... a similar phenomenon prevails in
the inner city, with the underclasses...

anyway, i end up liking those cultural forms, too, that don't find
their audience (or "origins") in urban areas... and maybe we need to
distinguish, too, the massive urban areas from the smaller urban
areas, which latter i've always found, personally, to be more livable
(that's just me, i know)... i don't like struggling to put a roof
over my head... and i think that that kind of struggle can make an
urban-cosmopolitan "paradise" look, and feel, an awful lot like
hell...

but i take your point...

best,

joe

Hi all,

As someone who has until recently written only poetry and criticism, I was
wondering if you had any thoughts on the journals/mags most open to publishing
experimental drama and/or fiction.  To my surprise, I've started writing some.

Saneh, first off, just plow through all the essays in Creeley's Complete Essays
(California, I think), they're brilliant. What you'll find most valuable
depends on what you're looking for butthey're all good.  The, OTTOMH, Nate
Mackey's 2 chapters on Creeley in _Discrepant Engagement_ are quite good.

I'd publish some experimental drama and/or fiction at Big Bridge is someone
would send some. Looking for work for the summer. But nobody ever sends me
that stuff, only warmed over Raymond Carver

Mike,

You're right on California as publisher, but the title is The Collected =
Essays rather than "Complete."  Absolutely a great place to begin, and =
there are many published interviews which are also very useful, for =
instance Boundary 2 Volume VI, No. 3; VII, No. 1 published in =
Spring/Fall 1978.  This issue also includes contributions by Peter =
Quartermain, Robert Grenier, Ed Dorn, Robert Duncan and Bill Sylvester.  =
Another great secondary source is Robert Creeley's Life and Work: A =
Sense of Increment.   His author-page at the epc might also be a =
convenient, yet extensive resource, available at: =
<http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/creeley/>

All the Best,

Kyle

i get that lewis, i really do, but at the same time, and if i'm
hearing you aright, i find it helpful that we return (again and
again) to the institutional conditions that condition our writing
(and of course, one can do this via one's poetry, as zappa did via
his music)... that a number of us happen to be academics (.edu) means
that we're within our rights to critique that category---hereabouts
(in terms of "career," and the emerging critical category "career
criticism," or whatever)... that a number of us are not academics, as
i've indicated before on this list, means that some folks ought
perhaps to indicate to us how they see their art as conditioned by
other institutional realities (i'd be happy to talk e.g. about my
industrial (engineering) experience and how this has influenced my
understanding of poetry)... for me, in any case, resistance to this
thread at least hints at resistance to thinking about such matters,
and i find that not only regrettable (if only b/c i LIKE to talk
about such stuff!), but potentially limiting, even as i wouldn't (as
i've argued elsewhere) want to "discipline" all discussion by/with
the disciplinary...

peace,

joe

hey joe...

"i've indicated before on this list, means that some

oh, i'm not resisting this thread, really...it IS
important to discuss how the context of the
institutions contributes to one's work...

but, ultimately, as the who said (god, i'm just full
of old rock quotes today): "...pick up my guitar and
play/just like yesterday" which means: whatever
institutional context i find myself in (at this point,
none whatsoever, as far as academia's concerned), i'll
still be creating...
in some ways i share andrew's cynicism about the
careerist aspect of poetry...but on the other hand i
also find that whole viewpoint a bit romantic...i'm
torn about things like this, because i still have
enough angst in me (leftover from teens and early
adulthood) to recognize the dangers of the
professionalism andrew brings up, but i've also grown
to the extent that i can see some benefits in it...i
mean, i don't believe ANY program can entirely divest
one of one's talent and drive: if it does, you're not
really an artist to begin with (because, as far as i'm
concerned, an artist HAS to create...it's almost a
biological need...)
i went to kent state, and the program there's
atrocious (they had creeley in after i left, which
would have been exciting, but while i was there the
program was very much geared toward a
quasi-confessionalist verse////i was the odd guy out,
and it showed(& i didn't mind))....(i also suspect i
woulda been the odd guy out in any program
anywhere...seems my nature)

in any case, enough of this rambling...just don't want
any to think i believe this discussion to be
unimportant...but i will, after all, in whatever
context, just pick up my guitar and play...
bliss

You can't just play like yesterday; years ago I learned delta blues guitar
from a number of people, including some of the older players - but I felt
that, given the roots of the music, it would be absurd for me to play it -
again the institutionalization came into effect here.

Even with rock it's whose guitar, whose music, whose songs, whose getting
paid, whose listening -

Thought I'd bring a recent book to folks' attention, especially if they
happen to be teaching.  Keith Tuma just received the new (3rd) edition of
the _Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry_, which is now edited (since O'Clair
& Ellmann's deaths) by Jahan Ramazani.  I haven't seen it yet but there's
tables of contents given in PDF form at

http://www.wwnorton.com/college/titles/english/namcop3/

which are deeply discouraging.  (The little black triangles next to items on
the t.o.c.s I believe indicate new inclusions; omissions are unlisted.)  My
own area of expertise concerns British poetry, & it's striking how this
selection, already in the previous edition rather minor & highly slanted to
the most conservative canon of UK poetry, has been left essentially static,
beyond cutting a bunch of earlier figures & the addition of Ivor Gurney &
Mina Loy in vol.1. Keith's eye was caught by annotations to Loy's "English
Rose", which look suspiciously familiar, e.g.: here's Ramazani's first
note--

_Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose_ is a long, semi-autobiographical poem
about Loy's English mother (allegorized as the Rose, Alice, and Ada)
and her Jewish father (Exodus). The rose is a traditional symbol of
England.  Many heraldic representations are modeled on the dog rose,
whose flowers are somewhat square, or "quadrate."

--& here's my own opening notes to the same poem in Keith's _Anthology of
20th-Century British & Irish Poetry_ (OUP, 2001):

Loy's _Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose_ is a long semi-autobiographical poem;
Exodus, introduced in the first section of the poem, is modeled on Loy's
Jewish father; Alice (or sometimes "Ada") on her mother.
[gloss to title:] The rose is the traditional symbol of England. Heraldic
and symbolic representations are usually modeled on the dog-rose, whose
flowers have somewhat squared-off ("quadrate") outer edges, and which bloom
from late May or early June to early August.

& comparison of the rest of the notes is similarly revealing.  I haven't got
a copy of the book myself to see if this lift is a one-off or if Ramazani's
done this elsewhere too.  A few other inclusions in the Norton--Tony
Harrison's _V._, some of Keith's more offbeat choices--also suggest the
editor's occasional lucky dip in the OUP book while avoiding its
interrogation of the standard narratives of 20th-c. poetry (I say this
rather than "of 20th-c. British & Irish poetry" since one of the standard
narratives it questions is the idea that British poetry was of minor
significance compared to American poetry in the 20th poetry). Meanwhile the
book contains a ref. in the back to Keith's work as a critic but the OUP
book goes unmentioned.  Anyway, the Norton selection of UK work is a farce:
Kingsley Amis & Stephen Spender are some of the few authors to survive the
cuts while WS Graham & Tom Raworth & a host of others are omitted yet again.

But all this looks like generosity itself compared to the purge of Canadian
poetry.  Basically, virtually all of the (mainstream) Canadian canon gets
liquidated in return for a chunk of Anne Carson.  (Nonmainstream Canadian
poetry?--you've got to be kidding.)  Nick LoLordo has typed in for me a list
of the _omissions_ (needless to say, not listed on the Norton website).  I
enclose his comments & list below:

The one good thing in the book is the boosting of postcolonial literatures
to a substantial position in the book.  & a few US Language poets make the
cut--Bernstein, Hejinian, S Howe, Palmer.  Zukofsky & Oppen make it in,
unlike the 2nd edition of the book.  Tolson's in there too. -- Yet,
basically the book is appalling.  So I'm writing to suggest that if you
receive survey forms or promo copies or the like that you make your thoughts
on the book known to Norton.

sifting back in my recollections of the last narcissist's war
it seems to me there was a movement of intellectuals back to the people and
the land?  Problem is though what w Jerry Springer and freeways and ceterae
there are really no wide open spaces to go toward anymore.  and you can't go
home again because the set in their ways are even setter.  libraries and
bookstores out here do tend to be less courant but perhaps that's for the
best.

dear ....here is first contact from ur old new
Virginia.....
       when you wrote the last poem i give it a very
serious thought....and I figured it out ....i mean my
quite loneliness ......cuz i start to blame my self
.....but....should I?!?!?!?...am not giving any excuse
here....but....let's stop for a while ...let's stop the
time and the movement all around me...and to have a
look ..!!!.....let me convince my self of my
existence.....
        now am really alone...no one is here but me
....oh..ok.....
am I living with them or they are living with me ??? who
needs who??? do i need them to tell me how great
...and brilliant and how beautiful I am??? or they need
me to tell them how happy I am cuz they all around me,
and that am nothing without them ???
wait....wait..... am i nothing without them really
??????? OH my GOD whom am facing here???? me or them???.

      am facing my suffering thoughts....my
weakness...my sensitive Formosa....my lying
promises....am facing every thing leads me to
nowhere...to nothing....there is no direction to my thoughts
or my lucky pennies ....and i don't know the page I'm
walking in !!!! am i really alone or there is others
with me ????? for how long do u think this strong wind
will last?? can i hang up with my weakness.....and my
small wings???? what do i need to face it? or to get
over it ?.......why i don't just let it take me to its
waves.......................
         but u know ...no matter how hard you try to
keep my soul around it will never survive....now I
realize that moving away from words can be very
painful and difficult, still i assume that.........
    i don't know if i have enough generosity to forgive
my self for its inability to understand my life....i
really don't know .
    am sorry jeff really i am (i said sorry more than i
said mum) what can i say???
and this is why am writing to you .....maybe cuz I'm
ceaseless.....

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

A recent Amazon.com review of Defense.

"Upper-Crust Poetry Disguised As Fart Joke, January 22, 2003
Reviewer: A reader from New Jersey
To the point: one guy reviewing this book gives it five stars before he
reads it because... he took a class from Gudding at Cornell. Of course he did.
Save your money.
This book is awful.
The title of the book and the description on the back cover insinuate that
Mr. Gudding is out to mock poetry and bring it down to size. Yeah right.
Mr. Gudding is T.S. Eliot without the vison, Ezra Pound with all the boring
insider information and none of the imagery, and his language is an
extremely poor impersonation of James Joyce. I have a Ph.D. in Lit and
teach part-time at Brown, and I don't get half the insider jokes
(supposedly jokes, at least) in this collection.
To make matters worse, this book is long. So long. Half way through I
begged it to end and it wouldn't.
The speaker in these poems is so snobby, I couldn't help reading him and
being thankful at his lack of talent. One of his teachers should have told
him: anyone can open an encyclopedia and write a poem, kid, you're not that
smart.
None of these poems are smart. Which is fine. I like poems that are easy to
read and fun and do nothing more than entertain.
This book doesn't entertain. It's not funny, and it's embarassing to watch
it try to be funny. The attempt at humor here is basically flatulence, but
South Park pulls it off one hundred times better.
In short, save your money. Allow this book to run its course. Next year a
couple part-time professors (Gudding's pals and former profs) will teach
this book and the students who read it will be repulsed and they will go
back to reading Rich or Levine or anyone better than this, and Gudding
will, thank god, go out of print.
Such is the history of most bad poetry.
And this book is surely the baddest. By baddest I mean the absolute worst."

I know Jahan Ramazani and have full confidence in his
ethics. I would be strongly resistant to any suggestion that
he intentionally included unattributed material in the book.
If there's a problem in the Mina Loy section or the
bibliography, it is quite likely a mistake. The book is the
product of graduate student research assistants as well as
of the editor; though I'm sure he would agree that the
final responsibility is his, it's not inconceivable that an
inexperienced contributor could have failed to cite all
sources appropriately.

As for the scope of the anthology and the changes from the
2nd edition, of course these are valid subjects for
critique, though calling the edition "appalling" seems to
me a bit much. I'll only say that I know he considered it a
priority to include Objectivists and Language poets, two
groups entirely missing from the last edition.

Having some trouble with my e-mail yesterday and today, and
already this thread has moved on, so I should probably just
let it go -- but of course, being male, I can't. I'll
defend selectivity in graduate programs -- remember that at
this point in the discussion we (or at least I) had moved
beyond MFAs to talk about graduate humanities degrees in
general -- I'll defend selectivity, then, based on the
assumption that the purpose of a graduate degree is to make
somebody employable. If the training a job requires costs
tens of thousands of dollars and takes five or more years to
complete (talking PhDs now), it's an ethical problem to be
producing far more candidates than there are job openings.
That's all I'm saying. Universal education for all -- sure,
I'm for it, who isn't. But I'm also for making the system
that actually exists accountable for and to itself.

the idea of "a large program" seems more of a marketing
tool to convince applicants that "large" is prestigious,
when really "large" is about the numbers, the money, which
has created the industrial complex universities have become
today.  i guess the real prestigious would shoot for
tighter numbers, difficult standards.

i support selectivity  as being in everybody's best interest.
however, there are some departments at some schools --self-protection
compels my vagueness here --who accept more phd students than they
know will be able to find the kind of employment they think they are
training for, in order precisely to provide cheap teaching for basic
u-grad courses and to fill their own grad seminars.  it's quite
cynical, and is part of the way depts perpetuate themselves as
budgetary entities rather than conduits for intellectual exploration
or development, or even serious professionalization of the next
generation of professors.

criss-crossed my snailmail box today: "Historical Generations and
Psychology" from the latest _American Psychologist by Lloyd Rogler, an
overview of generational theory in psychology relating to some ideas from
Gergen and Niemeyer as it crosses and criscrosses discourse.

Although I am a participant observer on this I think it's very relevant to
discussions here, espcially since 911, on politics, trauma, Willie nelson,
po careerism, etc.

I found it worth reading.  It should be in most libraries if interested.

Damian--It sounds petty to quarrel with your generous personal defense; but,
with all due repect, the upshot of this matter isn't entirely about personal
ethics.

Let's compare those two notes again (quoting from Nate's message):

"e.g.: here's Ramazani's first note--

_Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose_ is a long, semi-autobiographical poem
about Loy's English mother (allegorized as the Rose, Alice, and Ada)
and her Jewish father (Exodus). The rose is a traditional symbol of
England.  Many heraldic representations are modeled on the dog rose,
whose flowers are somewhat square, or "quadrate."

--& here's my own opening notes to the same poem in Keith's _Anthology of
20th-Century British & Irish Poetry_ (OUP, 2001):

Loy's _Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose_ is a long semi-autobiographical poem;
Exodus, introduced in the first section of the poem, is modeled on Loy's
Jewish father; Alice (or sometimes "Ada") on her mother.

[gloss to title:] The rose is the traditional symbol of England. Heraldic
and symbolic representations are usually modeled on the dog-rose, whose
flowers have somewhat squared-off ("quadrate") outer edges, and which bloom
from late May or early June to early August.

*****

I don't know Jahan Ramazani and have no reason to lack confidence in his
professional ethics--but surely a careful reading suggests that Nate's concern
is legitimate. The point here would then be for Norton, as the inevitable
reprinting process proceeds, to make some appropriate
acknowledgement....

Moreover, Nate's analysis of the latest version of the Norton canon suggests
that accidental omissions can easily be read in the context of a coherent
larger narrative:  in this case, the history of the aforementioned canon and
its treatment of particular modes of poetic practice, facts which for which
some collective entity is, in the last analysis, responsible.

I don't think anyone's posted this news to the list.  Haines' poetry was
featured on Carla Bley's famously ambitious (not to say sprawling)
_Escalator Over the Hill_ (whose cast of musicians ran from Don Cherry to
Linda Ronstadt), & he was the subject of a 1994 2-CD tribute album, _Darn
It!_.  His work was comparable to Clark Coolidge's in its very personal
attempt to find a poetic vocabulary that responded fully to both musical
innovations in jazz & to the abstractions of Gertrude Stein & her poetic
descendents.  Like Coolidge he was the author of some of the most
idiosyncratically eloquent liner notes to jazz CDs in existence--try Paul
Bley's _Footloose_ on Savoy or Evan Parker's _Saxophone Solos_ on
Chronoscope for a taste. --N

It is with deep sadness that I inform you of the passing of Paul Haines, who
died at home in Ennismore, Ontario on Tuesday, January 21. Whether as poet,
music writer or filmmaker, Paul possessed the rarest quality--genuine
originality. His vision, wit and expansive generosity will be missed by all
who knew him and his work. A memorial celebration of Paul's life is being
planned to take place in Toronto.

the kindest, most ethical people in the world, i've discovered, are
capable of plagiarizing.  they are working at top speed and not being
very careful, and are hoping no one will notice. i've been
plagiarized --minor stuff, just clauses, not whole pages or central
arguments --by friends.  still, it hurts, as in this profession, our
words are our real --only --"product" (and don't everyone jump all
over me for using marketplace language).  it's a delicate matter; one
wants to point out the problem without shaming the other person and
without losing the relationship, which often means accepting
face-saving excuses from the other person that don't really hold up
--but you can be sure that, even if they think you're the most
high-maintenance diva in the world, they'll never do it again.

if you're really upset, though, as i've been on other less friendly
occasions, or if a heart-to-heart with someone you don't know who has
a lot more institutional power than you just isn't appropriate or in
your best interest, i'd contact the national writers' union and
inquire about making a grievance.  often one can get *some*
satisfaction.  one can always play hard-ball with a lawyer who
specializes in intellectual property, though that's a lot more
expensive than joining the writers' union.
as for the matter of omissions and alterations, that's what these
anthologies are all about and have always been. imagine my surprise
when, in my first year teaching at umn, 1988, i'd ordered the norton
modern so i could teach gwendolyn brooks along with haki madhubuti's
poem "gwendolyn brooks" --they sent the then-latest edition which had
excised most of the Black Arts Movement poetry as well as some others
like O'Hara's "Should Abortion Be Legalized?"  It was a great

damian and others, the problem of course is how to maintain
selectivity based on job market conditions and *not* confuse this
tactic, esp. over in mfa/ma/creative writing land (which could be phd
land too, i  know), with the "poets are born, not made" mantra (and
similar such constructions) that enable cw profs to pick & choose
aesthetics (and discard others) that don't fit their preconceived
notions of poetry (i.e., that don't fit their often unstated
ideologies and beliefs)... as if one is to teach only those already
teach-able...

imagine if other disciplines tried to do this... of course this turns
on what is being taught, and how what is being taught, is being
taught... i have heard some cw faculty remark that there is no body
of knowledge apropos of creative writing... further, that you can't
teach it...

and if this is the case, what on earth are we paying these folks for?...

and since i've been seeing this sort of thing at work here now for a
few years---also at the undergrad level, where we (faculty) both pick
those students who can enter our undergrad cw track, AND pick those
students we want to see in our upper division workshops (all of this
on a completely individual basis, as faculty don't discuss this with
one another)---well, i would say that problems at the grad level are
simply an intensification of same (albeit i assume the undergrad
condition prevails via something like back formation)...

mind you, our undergrad degree in english is a ba, w/o further
qualification on the diploma, whether or not you do the lit track or
the cw track... moreover, the lit track does not require separate
application...

it's a nightmare... and ours is not an atypical situation...

i take cary nelson's (and others') argument that grad programs in
english ought to cut back on the number of graduates they're
producing, given the woeful job market (and of course, woeful
publishing conditions)... but reading nelson, i sometimes get the
idea that he *knows* what worthwhile scholarship is---that is, that
he's tacitly endorsing the status quo in some sense... and this does
present something of a problem, i think, for an industry that,
however much it may have theoretically displaced
originality/authenticity etc, continues to laud original,
autonomously conceived work (and again, this is only aggravated over
in cw land)...

best,

joe

A Big Thank you ! --

You've got me very excited about reading his Collected Essays - as i said
before i wanted to write my work  from a phenomenological perspective that
involves a zero distance between reader and text: but knew that i would have
to manage to get in some work written on work - so Creeley's own work on
work will be perfect supplemantary material for my work!

{a reply to Patrick Herron}

Didn't know I was going to provoke such wrath (and so
much revealing attitudes) by my response to your (and
Lester's) response.
While I'm not going to try to open this up fully in my
reply, I hope to skim over a few things I agree and
disagree with you as regards this issue.

THINGS I AGREE WITH:
1) Yes, the computer is just a tool...just like a
pencil...
2)Don't believe any hype....I'm definitely with you
there...


THINGS I DISAGREE WITH:
1) The use of the word "dominant":

"...to be frank your socioeconomic background explains
in part why you
might not know exactly how to engineer such a vertical
poetic system...it
takes capital investment...the dominant programmer is
something altogether
different from the dominant poet.  though you do share
your enthusiasm for
it.  you haven't had the education, the time in school
learning the
mathematics or using the high-end equipment needed to
perfect such a
vertical system.  programming is a very vertical
world.  potentially.  there
are wonderful community aspects about rhe programming
world, but most of my
experience in high-end exotic programming systems (and
real poetry machines
of the sort Bok seems to suggest) comes from working
with people who have a
LOT of money.  We're talking Ford, Verizon, Avaya, HP,
Lockheed, etc.  They
have the tools you need.  and they're not losing
control.  they're getting
it.  programming takes years and resources to learn,
while poetry can come
at a moment's notice.  there's overlap, but there are
also regions of each
realm that do not overlap."

--What does it signify? Who are 'the dominant poets?'
Is this elitist? Simply because I never had the money
to go to a "good" school, does this mean I couldn't
POSSIBLY understand what you're talking about?
INteresting...


3) I characterized Lester's reaction as "kneejerk"
because, well, let's face it, whenever anyone hears
about anything related to computer's the word
"soulless" is attached. And my point was, you don't
expect the pencil to have a soul, do you?

4)"of course these lines are blurred in the middle: a
poet might use
programs as a tool to produce poetry out of data
poetically selected, or
might insert code-generated statements inside a
non-code generated poem.
sure sure.  but you're talking about "really" and
"aritifical" and so forth,
and so if we are to speak in terms of the pith of
these things it's hard NOT
to see the differences."

These are exactly the kinds of algorithms I've
written. they require human input. All of my remarks
about computer-mediated text generation use the
machine only as a shuffling device.

5)"One way of saying this is that if language is
rule-generated, then how do errors happen in language
generation all of the
time? "

read linguists...

errors happen for a variety of reasons in both human
and machine context...of course, i'm not sure there
ARE errors (but then, I don't have the education to
know the difference, do I?)====

errors can only occur in a presriptive view of
language...


6)"there IS a difference between
Kubla Khan and a computer-generated poem (there are
many but one in
particular is glaring).  There is no difference only
if we 1.  take a purely
semiotic point of view and 2.  ignore the fact that
Coleridge neither was a
computer nor 3.  further it has yet to be proven that
human language can be
perfectly modeled by a computer."

---and I am taking a semiotic point of view...not a
strong AI one (I've read Searle, my firend)...I never
asserted that the machine would produce this without
human input...the machine can't do much of anything
without human input...

no, human language can't be perfectly modelled by a
machine yet...yet...but computational linguistics is
looking into it...and reading the literature on it,
I'd have to say that eventually we'll be pretty
close...

(reading pinker's language instinct...every objection
he has to the machine ever being able to produce human
languaage prompts me to think, well, no, you could
write a function to do this)

but there will always be a human behind it,
patrick...always...


7)"It seems to
me that you are caught up in something, that you have
a Movement to
Vanguard.  There are Manifestoes to be written, yes?
Fluffernutter.
Doesn't it feel a little silly?"

You haven't done your homework here, Patrick. I'm not
a codepoet. I use algorithms for text generation in
some cases; mostly i just write myself. The algorithms
I use involve input from me (they do not automatically
generate, they must be fed)...I do networks, of
course, but that's something quite different from what
you're talking about. Those are hypermedia works, and
I don't consider them the same thing as my poetry. I
work with Flash and a few other software suites
(Photoshop, Visual Basic, Swift3D, Lightwave, sound
editors, etc etc)...




To me your whole argument against this is restrictive.
Not Luddite; proximate.org proves you're no Luddite
(but as you yourself pointed out it doesn't try to get
beyond the book at all, and mirrors print
technologies, which is not what I'm about, which is
why I turned to pseudo-random algorithms and
generative algorithms in the first place, so that
certain pieces would vary themselves with every
viewing). I know you do Java (I myself do no Java,
just Visual Basic and C and C++ and Javascipt and
Flash, all of which I'm sure you do too). Your
argument is similar to the arguments against the early
avant-gardes: oh, don't stray into non-representation;
don't play with the surface of your media; there's no
soul there. I believe you to be wrong, but I admire
your tenacity, and your arguments are quite
intelligent (a bit uninformed when it comes to my own
work, and to understanding the nature of language and
cognitive science, but that's okay...those are all
just paradigms, and can be seen through...).

I have no desire to have a pissing contest with you,
as I feel there's just too much hostility in the world
right now. So I submit my arguments with respect; if I
sound angry at times it's because I am, and it's an
anger provoked by elitism and misunderstanding.
There's far too much snobbery in these waters out
here, on both the poetry side and the net art side,
and it's horribly unproductive; it closes off too many
possibilities. And what I want is more mixing and
melding and meshing; that's where beauty comes from.
So, bless you! Halleleuia anyway!!!

bliss,
l

my soul apparent



lacking a particle of a dream, one might say that their houses are
false images reduced in scale on a grand scale, forced from the
threshold of absurdity to the contradiction of numbers, left with
nothing camouflaged interiors and cardboard psychology. but tiny things
deserve more amusement; paint-by-number tunnels, and / or miniature
jailers. I myself, for a few seconds escape the cracks to a smaller
then logic example; hotter than other parts, warm and condensed. there,
the mass generate vital heat in the spirit of opposite paths. from that
moment on multi-playing pretexts fall short, motion slows to a
meditation coalescence of unlimited values. we have a dream invitation
to continue anything without a central sum, valorized in flower
correspondence, grown in chalices of webbed threads and blind folders.
deep inside a thousand fur lined tea cups, the stamens remain in place,
while all the pistils grow in india under a gentle warm intimacy

Dear Friends and Fellow Poets:

When I picked up my mail and saw the letter marked "The White House," I
felt no joy. Rather I was overcome by a kind nausea as I read the card
enclosed:

Laura Bush
requests the pleasure of your company
at a reception and
White House Symposium on
"Poetry and the American Voice"
on Wednesday, February 12, 2003
at one o'clock

Only the day before I had read a lengthy report on the President's proposed
"Shock and Awe" attack on Iraq, calling for saturation bombing that would
be like the firebombing of Dresden or Tokyo, killing countless innocent
civilians.

I believe the only legitimate response to such a morally bankrupt and
unconscionable idea is to reconstitute a Poets Against the War movement
like the one organized to speak out against the war in Vietnam.

I am asking every poet to speak up for the conscience of our country and
lend his or her name to our petition against this war, and to make February
12 a day of Poetry Against the War. We will compile an anthology of protest
to be presented to the White House on that afternoon.

Please submit your name and a poem or statement of conscience to:
kokua@olympus.net

There is little time to organize and compile. I urge you to pass along this
letter to any poets you know. Please join me in making February 12 a day
when the White House can truly hear the voices of American poets.

Sam Hamill

Maria--thanks for the note.  If the plagiarism amount to just that one set
of annotations then I'll probably simply leave it there; but I think I'll be
combing through the book carefully first to see if it's an isolated
instance.  (Willing to bet that at least in the case of Harrison's _V._ it
isn't, since to my knowledge there's no other annotated edition of the poem
besides the one Keith & I did.)  I should clarify that I have no problem
with Ramazani's making use of my annotations--after all that's why they're
there: to be helpful!  & while the passages I quoted from his notes are
clear-cut instances of plagiarism (down to one sentence which is identical
barring the switch of an article: "the" to "a"), on the other hand there's
only so many ways to gloss words like "adamsite" or "penetralia".  What I'm
objecting to is the lack of credit, to the point of (suspiciously) omitting
to mention the book at all.  It's not as if the OUP book doesn't rely on
other sources & scholars than myself--but when I made substantial use of
them I credited them (e.g. the notes to Auden start with an acknowledgement
of indebtedness to John Fuller's work; those to Graham, a thankyou to Tony
Lopez; the notes frequently include explicitly acknowledged extracts from
correspondence with poets & scholars: e.g. the credit to Ric Caddel in a
note on Bunting).

I refer to "Ramazani" above: yes, I'm aware some lazy grad student
"researcher" may have been responsible for pinching the notes to Loy's poem
(though as I said some details of the selection suggest Ramazani's well
aware of the OUP book).  But ultimately Ramazani's the editor of the book &
has to take responsibility for its contents.

My original posting said nothing at all about Ramazani as a person, it was
purely about the book's contents.  I can well believe there's a mismatch
between Ramazani's admirable qualities as a person & what I take to be in
many regards a quite disgraceful book--not knowing him personally I can't
begin to reconcile the two, but I don't feel I need refrain from criticizing
the book because the author's a decent sort.

This doesn't mean one has to accept _particular_ omissions & alternations,
especially when (as I indicated) they go beyond matters of author-by-author
taste & essentially write off the literary histories of several countries
(beyond the merest, almost random shards) at the same time as the
anthology's rubric claims to represent those countries/histories.  To simply
say that, well, any anthology will have to have its omissions, is to risk
fatalism or a mere passive "there's no disputing tastes" ethos.  The point
of anthologizing poetry, & of teaching it, is to dispute tastes.

As my original post indicated I thought the inclusion of objectivism,
language poetry & postcolonial writing in the book was good; that doesn't
exempt the rest from criticism.

all best --N

6 of Hearts


"He was soon forced to mute that praise, joking later, 'I was a little
forward on my skis'"

Between us, there are no good solutions. Family and oil.
It's the defense that took off, the worst-case scenario

I know now it turns somewhere, seems to taunt,
turns out of knowing, burns, spits, before it spins off
into needing, absolutely nothing in the dumb center

His rage roars (or squeaks) political motivation,
pain-stakingly paraphrased by his self-righteous press secretary
to tell and not show. He thinks we want to feel
his anger; once and for all, we just want him to think

"Do you remember those happy bygone boom days when
the stock market was going to save us from a variety of ills?
Rising stock prices would solve the problem of Social Security
short falls, boost federal, state and local income-tax revenues,
and let us all retire young, rich and happy. It never happened, of course"

You do not need to prove damage or malice in an uphill
battle. Show the ordinary showing. Where's the line
you can't cross though the world of adult products?
Why are women in the mud, wrestling? I never imagined
how much of myself I retained out of their hands. It
is my body now. I will never have to face death again

The dumb reed reposing wrenches renown from the
No Mind's Lunge. This is a reasonable rhyme for a
retch of pretested grind that has yet to be dropped
by either side. The roaming has come to moan a
hunted smoggy expense of salient slum. A lump -
frayed, sallow, mean, mostly frayed, presumptive
except for the deed. Stars may romp across and remain stars



Best, Crag Hill

I admittedly haven't had the experience Maria describes,
though I am quite sure that I would feel much the same way.
I probably would not make the decision to air my concerns
in so public a manner, however, simply because I could
easily see them founding a damaging and misleading rumor
about the editor in question. "One wants to point out the
problem without shaming the other person," as Maria aptly
puts it -- at least as a first recourse.

I must say that I do not see how one would support the
contention that an attribution problem belongs, as Nate and
Nick have both suggested, to the same category as a set of
informed editorial decisions, whatever one may think of
those decisions. It seems to me rather that the first
accusation in Nate's original post is working rhetorically
to lend an implication of questionable ethics to the
critique that follows it.

If I were teaching a modern/contemporary poetry course this
semester and wanted a big anthology, I would probably go
with the Rothenberg/Joris Poems for the Millenium myself. I
suspect, though, that the new Norton reflects more
accurately the typical course of this kind. (Produces and
reflects, yes.)

I agree with Joe that selectivity brings with it the burden
of carefully defining your criteria, and -- coming from a
large program myself (300+ graduate students) -- I wouldn't
want to sacrifice the diversity and flexibility that comes
along with inclusiveness.

I'm sure that some of you will be familiar, though, with
the latest statistics. In the MLA's Profession 2002,
in the report of the ad hoc committee on the
professionalization of PhDs, we have 2,548 total job
seekers for the 2001-02 hiring cycle and 1,162 positions
actually filled. This is not a bad statistic for some
professions, perhaps, but if you factor in the time and
cost of reaching employability, and the fact that hiring
basically happens only once a year, you have a
disheartening situation wherein talented people are forced
to repeat the job search over three or four years sometimes
before a decent offer -- sometimes, *any* offer --
comes along. Many give up before that happens.

It occurs to me that with roughly 2 1/2 times as many
applicants as filled positions, the job market may be
working quite well these days from the point of view of the
hiring institution. Any less and everybody would be
interviewing the same people, right? And fighting over the
same people.

I think it was Murat who said that the problem of
adjuncting factors in here as well. I said in this space
some time ago that adjuncting from the individual point of
view could be quite the appropriate choice -- and I've seen
people for whom it does work -- but from an institutional
perspective it's a poison.

Another issue related to selectivity has to do with the
effectiveness of *any* predictive criteria. Undergraduate
grades, GRE scores, writing sample, personal statement --
given the amount of scrutiny these probably receive (one
hears of law school profs approving and denying
applications at random, because the qualifications are
always the same -- wonder if this ever happens in English
depts) I doubt that they give more than a very vague
and general idea of a candidate's abilities. But it's the
character of a department's faculty, more than its graduate
students, that determines whether a narrow or a broad, a
conservative or a progressive definition of the profession
will be promoted.

Jordan Davis on Medbh McGuckian: "Despite the considerable efforts of
Wake Forest UP, I find myself at an epistemological impasse when it
comes to the poetry of other countries, especially that of
Ireland--if I had to rely only on gatekeepers and kingmakers for my
sense of what is possible and who's finding it in the poetry of my
own conflicted, loveable country, I would be a much closer follower
of professional sports than I am."

Ray McDaniel on Cal Bedient: "This poetry is fascinating, until it
isn't, which is almost immediately. This sounds cavalier, but no: I
was struck again and again by the number of poems here that begin
with intrigue and promise and end in ruin . . ."

Christine Hume on Harryette Mullen: "Her exuberant, excessive,
exhaustive turns of language allow the culture its complexities; they
turn on--that is, betray--the contemporary passion for the homespun
that tends to flatten the planet with its humdrum cry from the heart,
which is really an excuse for dishonest oversimplification larded
over with speciously democratic myth. Why merely use the heart to
cry, asks Mullen."

The Defense review is ridiculous; why does someone have to announce
his/her Phd? What does that have to do with anything? And one must be
blind not to see the merit in Gudding's book. It might not be to X's or
Y's taste (it's to mine), but as far as merit or rating goes, it's new and
five-star quality, and good for Pittsburgh for publishing it - Alan

to respond to both of you in one swell foop, i would encourage anyone
who feels and can demonstrate that s/he has been plagiarized to seek
some kind of redress, be it a simple personal apology from the
culprit to a printed acknowledgment to legal settlement.  to me it's
a big deal, though i don't like confrontation so i tend to go the
non-threatening, low-intensity route of the heart-to-heart, and even
when i once threatened a grievance thru the National Writers' Union i
ended up settling for a promise of an acknowledgment when the book
was reprinted.  i have yet to see if they keep their word on that
one.  however, i agree that an acknowledgment at the very least is in
order, but the book is already out, so i'd write a letter to
ramazani, and if he doesn't answer threaten norton w/ a grievance and
see what they come up with, be willing to settle for some kind of
acknowledgment at the very least, or whatever they offer by way of
settlement.  mostly they're just scared of having to pay you money.
but this is just my advice; the important thing is to do what you're
comfortable with, that both acknowledges the fact of the plagiarism
and also doesn't expose you to more conflict than you are willing to
deal with.  I didn't want to shame the people involved because i had
personal and professional relationships with them, and in one case it
was an individual who had less institutional clout than i, not a
hotshot who was trying to coast on the work of the less renowned, so
i didn't want to be overbearing.  in the other case it was a small
literary publisher in the same town i work in --it's a small world
and i didn't want to feel weird every time we had to have "dealings."
of course with someone with a lot of institutional clout there are
other reasons for not putting him/her on the defensive, such as
simple self-interest. however, i think it important that we not take
these matters lying down.  i've heard horrific tales of --women,
particularly, who were driven out of their professions because
someone --a husband --stole their research and their thunder --and
horrific tales from male colleagues about being ripped off by their
grad school profs after getting scathing comments and low grades on
their papers --the very papers that were plagiarized from by the
nasty graders and commentators!  those people suffered severe blows
to their self-esteem -- their professional lives --or lack thereof
--bore these scars quite explicitly. sorry to go on and on -i'm
approaching joe's verbosity now --but i feel very strongly that
people should at least do something to acknowledge what has happened
to their intellectual property.

It is widely reported that Iraq easily has the capacity for its oil
production to rise from 3 million barrels per day to over 10 million.  The
Manjoon and West Qurna fields might comprise the very prize that was not
"realized" in Gulf War I.

"We've always been up against a high degree of nationalism in Iraq. But
reality must now be faced," said a top Western oil executive working in the
Middle East in 2002. "Iraq is on its knees and needs the international oil
companies for their technology, cash and management."

I am afraid we are all about to bear witness to that grim "reality," that
horror called war.

********************

Iraq develops oil fields without foreign help
http://217.158.86.13/ip/data/ipenglish/8104.htm

Amman, Iraq Press, July 26, 2002 - Iraq claims to have partially developed
two of its huge oil fields when foreign firms refused help for fear of
violating U.N. trade sanctions.

Local newspapers say crude oil is now flowing from the massive al-Majnoon
field in southern Iraq at a rate of 50,000 barrels a day. The field, one of
the world's largest, is believed to hold up to 30 billion barrels of
reserves.

Quoting Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rasheed, the papers said the Iraqis had
also brought another giant field, West Qurna, on stream, pumping an
additional 50,000 barrels a day from it.

Iraq has signed oil development deals with at least half a dozen foreign
firms but none has been willing to start so long as the U.N. trade sanctions
imposed for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait are in place.

The embargo prohibits investment in Iraq's oil industry although Baghdad is
allowed by the United Nations to sell oil to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian needs for the Iraqi people as well as spare parts to
rehabilitate its war-ravaged oil industry.

Russia's largest oil company, Lukoil, signed 3.5 billion dollar contract in
1997 to develop West Qurna with reserves put at about eight billion barrels.

French company TotalFina Elf enjoys exclusive negotiating rights for Majnoon
and Bin Umar oil fields.

China, India and Vietnam have all signed contracts with Iraq to develop its
oil reserves, which are the world's second largest after Saudi Arabia.

The Iraqis have apparently lost patience and started developing the fields
themselves. But its unlikely that they will be able to increase their
production substantially without foreign help.

Industry analysts put Iraq's current production capacity at about three
million barrels a day and say foreign investments worth billions of dollars
are needed for any significant boost in output.

This is how I would make your Film.

glottal orange down on the brainscan of amorous I've
got sunshine/.../on a clou/.../dy day.  My new
cigarette stops world war from metaphorically should
be complete by 2003/01/24 14:25:02, she moans, placing
each possibility before the slit in her nipples is a
point of view I don't share with the monkey gnaws her
from inside, outward toward war dens alight on the
fingertips of lust for bigger cars hangs limply over
one eye. The animal that point of view is veers

and sharpens in pensive rooms
when animals pour sites across thighs
made for pixels crystal in
oddly new foliage. Shapes. She

stares for awhile at the escalator.
Does it look back at her, I

wonder, and if so on the phone
to her mother, tutoring in
image crops. Mostly, I don't

think about it; every cluster
is relevent in its contiguity. I

blink thought-dreams if our film's
bio-warfare's cracked by teenage
network thugs, and what of dribbling
on the palm?  Moisture recurs,

slick keys semen mental nametags;
I like this one, this one's worth, closure

of circles. I made sure the rope was snug around my
neck.  I tied myself to the bed you watched flames
wheeling through almost singing your face of praise
the bland poetics of broadband nausea, new seas of
light, lit by tilting swill planets of PHD. The
stairwell through your flesh watches as I think kings
for an outdoor ampitheater at twenty-four frames as
seconds of cgi interference with my skin's
thought-streams of media ate my headfruit from inside,
slippery, the dominant poets would have you believe

locking up. Because the/.../great/.../est/.../love of

It's sad to hear the news about Paul Haines.

And, perhaps, sadder still, I think this is the first time I've seen
mention of him by someone who wasn't more involved in new music than
in new writing.

Though I guess I'm not much different, as most of my own experience
with his work was hearing it sung by others either on records or (my
fondest memories of the work) a concert by Curlew with Amy Denio
singing Haines' texts set to music by  that I produced when I still
lived in Seattle.

I'm not sure I can think of another instance of a writer who is, as
noted by Nate Dorward, well within the pocket of, what are we calling
it now, "innovative poetry?" who is so much better known by artists
working in another field. Though I guess, a list of people working in
& around "innovative poetry" might not be the best place to find
references to other such examples.

I try to avoid the void altogether

  my ashen  words hang on my side with no  particular categories, force
into split level idioms.  I used the wrong ones in keyholes and ordered
a self issue subscription of myself to myself.  I know I am without
tax, or text,  or a real development plans, just some cracked glass and
a chocolate grinder with its own dual site of "I'm not it," "seek only
when I want to."  and as far as pornography, I just replace the
pronouns and nouns: she for he for she,  dog for a child for grandma
for a loaded revolver, warm and trustworthy - a fragment or example
that gets reprinted just before extinction.  distribution is widespread
to the obvious  misplaced positions between the bed and refrigerator .
. .  I mean greatest hits album and . . .  no,  it's already tuesday,
which is different than most four letter words, but the same post
arrangement of incidents.

Tom Raworth was born in London just before the Second World War and is
living in Cambridge during the Third One.  For more than forty years he has
worked, written, printed, published, taught, collaged, travelled, and
indulged the usual physical functions.  He likes spicy foods, and needs mor=
e
light as he gets older.  His Collected (not Complete) Poems will be
published in the UK by Carcanet Press in April 2003.

Zabet Patterson is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Rhetoric at UC

when down in DC for the march recently, i was surprised to see NO poets on
stage, except for Patti Smith, who sang PEOPLE HAVE THE POWER!  poets such as
Anne Waldman in the audience, listening with the rest of us to hours of
sometimes interesting, but mostly redundant speeches.  poets are ESSENTIAL to
lifting and formulating the language of change.  i had thought about asking
Waldman if we should storm the stage and insist they put her up there, but i
don't know this woman, so just sang along to Patti Smith with her like
everyone else.

next march, next meeting, next uprising we need to gather the hordes of
AMAZING young genius poets all over this country, fresh with outrage!

more later (you can count on it!),

                     you are invited to join us as....

                   Kelly Writers House Fellows presents

         a conversation with legendary screenwriter WALTER BERNSTEIN

                             via live webcast

                  10 AM eastern time - Tuesday - February 18


                        Among the most eminent living screenwriters,
                        WALTER BERNSTEIN was first a regular
                        contributor to The New Yorker and wrote for some
                        of early television's finest dramatic shows. He is
                        best known as the writer of films, among them
                        FAIL SAFE, THE MOLLY MAGUIRES, THE MAGNIFICENT
                        SEVEN, and THE FRONT (for which he received an
                        Academy Award nomination). During the
                        anticommunist period, he was blacklisted and
                        could not work openly as a writer. His memoir,
                        INSIDE OUT, is an account of this experience.

damian, i'm aware of those statistics, and honestly believe the
situation to be even worse than what mla has allowed, given the
relative inability to fully account for folks who've been out now
for > 5 years... but the working contradiction this points up
probably ought to be highlighted:  about the only way to stay IN a
profession for 4+ years post-doc is to work adjunct, as w/o keeping
one's toes in the professional h20, you likely won't be viewed as
competitive come job-seeking time... which is the primary reason why,
although a boycott of the profession by those who are working adjunct
(as murat suggests) sounds like a good idea, it's wishful thinking...
no way, under the circumstances, will job-seekers en masse boycott
the only probable path to the tenure-track...

i hold out much more hope for collective bargaining... albeit this
isn't going to be easy either, at least not in national terms...

i suppose this is why i'd much rather hear outrage expressed
hereabouts as to the abuses suffered by teachers (K-12 and
postsecondary, adjunct, ta's, and tenure-track workers) than outrage
directed AT these teachers... if someone hereabouts were getting the
shaft b/c of his/her clerical, trade, or knowledge-working
employment, i'd be on his/her side in spirit anyway... instead, as a
teacher, i often tend to hear, first, the "well, that's too bad,
maybe she can find something else to do for a living"... as if (1)
she's not a damn good teacher, and this isn't something to be valued
(and correspondingly, get upset about when she's forced out), and (2)
she can just up and "do something else"...

would you ask a plumber with 20 years experience to just "do
something else"?... or an engineer?... after all, those of us who
teach are, presumably, not working temp jobs here---this is our job!
(isn't it obvious?)... granted, we tend to have more "power" over
what kind of poetry gets taught and valued, e.g., than a computer
professional... but this is no reason not to support us, in
principle, in our efforts on behalf of teaching same... and after
all, some plumbers are halfassed, just as some teachers are... we're
not asking, that is, for anyone to take up the cause on our behalf...
but all too often, teaching is viewed (i'd say) with some degree of
envy from afar, as if profs just "lucked out" and ended up doing that
which many writers (say), if they could, would opt for themselves
(and despite all of this anti-professional talk)...

(apologies for reading motives here, but i think it's fair to say
what i've just said... i honestly don't think most folks understand
what all teaching entails *as* a job, and as a bureaucratically
saturated job, at that... which isn't to say there aren't "worse"
jobs---personally, this is the most supportive job i've found, as a
writer, and it's let me down in some Big Ways)...

so:  teaching is a job, among other things, and the phd is currently
the primary credential by which one qualifies for said job (much as
the baccalaureate is the primary credential for qualifying for any
number of professional jobs)... and if the phd doesn't guarantee one
a job (far from it!)---esp. given the immense degree of
professionalization that comes along with same---why then the
profession is going to distort accordingly... again, my concern is
that we don't permit those distortions to further distort our
perceptions of what's necessary... that is, that we don't tacitly
endorse business-as-usual for the sake of a depressed job market...
AND that we value teaching as a profession...

come to think of it, maybe *i'm* guilty of wishful thinking...

best,

joe

Hello everybody,

I recently declared myself a Mainstream Poet and defended this
self-identification with a poem, "Mainstream Poetry," which can be found on K.
Silem Mohammad's blog at http://limetree.blogspot.com/

Also included there is some illuminating commentary from Mohammad, who has also
declared himself Mainstream, as well as the address for Nada Gordon's blog,
where the poem also appears (she has not, to my knowledge, publicly declared
herself Mainstream, but a good argument could be made that she is.)

You're invited to Kasey's blog and, if moved, should declare yourself a
Mainstream Poet.

-m.

Thanks for spreading the word, Mike.

Also, everyone please send money.  We need to buy an advertising blimp.

"I am in the MAINSTREAM--I'm always in the mainstream, splashing around,
pissing, whatever.  Hence I am a mainstream poet, and incidentally, I've
never once seen Robery Pinsky in the main stream, I don't even think the
fucker swims."

What does this mean exactly, have you decided to suddenly suck?

With care, Geoffrey

ENDING THE WAR IN VIETNAM

I am the aging fat drunkard of a writer my bank account is empty
And my fellowship just came in from Stanford on high
By the iron mills of Pittsburgh and pissing burghers
In my mimic Proustian shoes I write for the chill of it

Depression is my middle name, my mayor just got busted
For child pornography, my aunt just said a prayer to Saint Francis
My seventy thousand limbs are flying off into space
A white haired white woman is decrying the canon she invented

No mail comes in but NPR just wants me to talk on exporting racism
And the dietary pleasures of a second hamburger in China
I am walking in the square of the communist chairman
Embalming the letter I

Keep writing Charley you may end the war in Vietnam yet
Or teach the new president to speak complete sentences
Who are you to speak you are better at muttering yourself
When you speak about Russia, people think you mean a trunk

If you just keep writing, it will add up to money in the bank
Said the Victorian biographer working on another life

On February 12, Laura Bush, wife of U.S. President George W. Bush, will be
hosting a symposium on "Poetry and the American Voice" at the White House.
But at the same time, American and other voices opposed to a senseless and
devastating war on Iraq are being ignored and silenced. In protest, a group
of American writers will come to the symposium with an anti-war petition and
anthology.

In solidarity with our American colleagues, the night before the symposium
Toronto Writers Against War will be hosting a Poets Against War Open Mike
February 11, 8 pm, at Bar Italia, 582 College St. Everyone who wants to read
-- one poem per person, please -- will be asked to donate $1, and all
proceeds will be donated to WarChild Canada, towards their humanitarian work
in Iraq. Anti-war petitions will be available for people to sign, and
information about letter-writing and upcoming protests will be distributed.

If you are in Toronto, please come! If not, please consider organizing an
event in your own city or town. And write to the American Poets Against War
at kokua@olympus.net to let them know about what we're doing to support the
cause.

PLEASE DISTRIBUTE WIDELY!!

For more info about this event, you can contact Maggie Helwig at

Yep.  The professionalization of poetry and poets via Creative Writing
programs, started by the U. of Iowa back in the day, also describes most of
the avenues to publication, prizes, and critical notice.  But in case anyone
misreads me, I'm not complaining, or crusading.  This is the way it is.
Them's just the facs, jack.  When the audience for poetry dwindled to a dot,
such things were likely inevitable.  By the way, I'm reading that the
Confessional Poets, especially Plath, are making a big comeback.  There's a
film on Plath in the works starring Gwinyth Paltrow (or however her name is
spelled).  Best, Bill

I'm in complete agreement on that, wouldn't want to suggest

describes are very rare indeed.

That's Richard Hamilton, "Just What Is It that Makes Today's Homes so
Different, so Appealing?" (1956)

I found out by doing a Google search, of course, but what's still bothering
me is where I remember seeing it first.  Is it in one of Marjorie Perloff's
books?  Jameson on postmodernism?  I'm away from my books at the moment.

Kevin,

"In 1956 [the Independent Group of the Institute of
Contemporary Art in London] held an exhibition at the
Whitechapel Art Gallery in London called 'This Is
Tomorrow,' which showed a series of contemporary
environments developed from photographs of architecture and
the vernacular imagery of the advertising world. Richard
Hamilton (1922- ) contributed a small collage that later
became justly famous as the Pop Art forerunner, although it
was actually unknown in America by the Pop artists, who
arrived at their styles independently either in the
mid-fifties or in the early sixties. The collage picture
was entitled _Just what is it that makes today's homes so
different, so appealing?_, and it showed a modern interior
occupied by a pin-up girl wearing only a lampshade-hat and
a muscle-man holding a large lollypop with the word POP
inscribed on it in bold letters. Crammed with the icons of
the consumer world -- tape recorder, canned ham,
television, comic-book cover, Ford advertisement, vacuum
cleaner -- and giving a view through the window onto a
movie marquee touting Al Jolson in _The Jazz Singer_, the
apartment reflects postwar Britain's nostalgic admiration
for American material prosperity and technological progress
... [Hamilton] irreverently listed the desirable qualities
for a new art as 'popularity, transience, expendability,
wit, sexiness, gimmickry, and glamor.'" -- Hunter, Jacobus,
and Wheeler, _Modern Art_ (Prentice Hall, 2000), 332-3

Cheers,
Damian

language has become the instrument of our doings and undoings in ways that it wasn't prior to
writing as instrument. there were writing instruments (pens pencils typewriters etc). but not
writing as instrument in this environment of generalized programming in which one writes the
instrument, the instrument to create instruments, etc, in a generalizing of nth generation
languages arrayed hierarchically toward a meshing of machine and natural languages.
hierarchically and then horizontally as they proliferate rhizomatically to fulfill specific
constellations of needs and situations, much like natural languages have proliferated
geographically.

all undergraduates who study computer science eventually take a course in language and the
theory of computation, study work by chomsky, for instance (who was trained initially as a
mathematician), in this course which can fall like a revelation on students of language used to
quite a different approach to and study of language.

what does it mean to be a poet?

this question could be answered in at least as many ways as there are poets. but most of them
would have something to say about an intense engagement with language in their work. part of the
heat, the intensity of that engagement now is focussed not simply on understanding writing as
instrument, but writing instruments that are themselves poetry in language that reaches through
the floor into the sky like a hand reaching for its answer.

aesthetic context for her work (great interviews with Brackage, Mekas,=20
Malina, et al) but also in presenting substantial excerpts from the films.=

With IN THE MIRROR OF MAYA DEREN, documentary filmmaker Martina Kudlacek=20
has fashioned not only fascinating portrait of a groundbreaking and=20
influential artist, but a pitch-perfect introduction to her strikingly=20
beautiful and poetic body of work.Crowned "Fellini and Bergman wrapped in=20
one gloriously possessed body" by the L.A. Weekly, Maya Deren (n=E9e=
 Eleanora=20
Derenkovskaya) is arguably the most important and innovative avant-garde=20
filmmaker in the history of American cinema. Using locations from the=20
Hollywood hills to Haiti, Deren made such mesmerizing films as AT LAND,=20
RITUAL IN TRANSFIGURED TIME, and her masterpiece, MESHES OF THE AFTERNOON,=
=20
which won a prestigious international experimental filmmaking prize at the=
=20
1947 Cannes Film Festival. Starting with excerpts from these films, IN THE=
=20
MIRROR OF MAYA DEREN seamlessly and effectively interweaves archival=20
footage with observances from acolytes and contemporaries such as=20
filmmakers Stan Brakhage and Jonas Mekas, dance pioneer Katherine Dunham,=20
and Living Theater founder Judith Malina. With an original score by=20
experimental composer John Zorn.

wow, this is exactly the type of stuff i am interested in --the
political and "everyday" uses of poetry/aesthetics, and the
demystification of those things as rarified or necessarily uplifting.
it is v upsetting to think that the anarchists tortured people,
though, and i'm glad that there is no mention in the article that
these cells were ever actually used.  my colleague charles sugnet is
writing extensively on Leopold Senghor's poltical use of Negritude,
including poetic torture of his political enemies when he came to
power.  not a pretty picture, but it has to be dealt with.

and, of course, we can easily see how Dana Giaoia's poetry has become so
cutting edge due to his real life work situation  etc ---

those examples certainly were selective ---

The bomb went off 'prematurely,=92 ripping through a police van.  The bomb=

went off in a popular cafe in Ein al-Helweh. When the bomb went off there
was a loud noise.  He called May 15 the day the bomb went off.  It looks l=
ike
a bomb went off.  While the first bomb went off at Juwett Memorial Baptist=

Church at Ongole in Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh at around 8.30 am,=

the second blast took place while emergency personnel were helping the
wounded. He and his girlfriend Kerry O'Shaughnessy, 28, would have been
in the Sari club when the bomb went off.  Another bomb went off on a
park bench near the US Embassy, injuring nine people.  The bomb went off
before sunrise, blowing out windows blocks away, shaking neighbors from
their sleep.  Two bombs were planted in the schoolyard; the first bomb wen=
t
off at about 9:45 am in a powerful explosion which blew out some of the
windows of the school.  And the bomb went off.  The first priority was to
get as much distance as he possibly could before the bomb went off.  A
bomb went off in Lhasa on Monday, the sixth reported explosion in the city=

in the last nine months.  He [J. Robert Oppenheimer] and I were lying down=

right next to each other flat on the desert right outside the control [roo=
m] at
the time the bomb went off.  A fire-fight broke out and one VC was last
seen firing into the smoking back seat of his car when the bomb went off. =

Another car bomb went off.  The bomb went off between 10 and 11 in the
evening on 24 June, near the City Public Security Bureau (PSB) Building,
which is situated about one kilometer north.  The bomb went off at the
wrong time. I don't think they were inside at the time but they were about=
 to
enter the club when the bomb went off.  This car bomb went off outside the=

South African Air Force HQ in Pretoria.  I lived in the YMCA, about 100
metres from where this bomb went off.  Tubbs said the warning call made
some 23 minutes before the bomb went off was a simple, non-specific
message.  Then on Saturday May 1, another bomb went off at a pub in
Makindye and injured 5 people. There were four days of peace before the
bomb went off.  Labourer Lakshmi, 26, recalled that she and her 18-month-
old daughter Nitya had barely returned from a tea stall close to the eater=
y
when the bomb went off.  After the bomb went off, the men sprayed
gunfire on fleeing passengers.  When the bomb went off we were kneeling in=

the bottom of it.

as the actual article points out this was geometric abstractionm
disorientation, and surrealism raher than the AG catchall, but I can see
poets being enlisted by agencies as propagandists?

Or maybe poetry that disorientsthe heartland would be more effctive than
heartland poetry against the war?

100 poets enlisted in protest against war

Montreal-born Todd Swift has organized
an e-mail demonstration of antiwar verse

By GAYLE MACDONALD

Tuesday, January 28, 2003 – Page R1


One week ago, the Montreal-born poet Todd Swift was sitting in a Paris
café, reading The Guardian, fuming about the hard-line American stance on
war with Iraq.

He decided to organize a protest -- of powerful words and haunting images.
And yesterday, to coincide with the release of the UN weapons inspectors'
report, Swift e-mailed an anthology called 100 Poets Against the War to
friends, family and far-flung acquaintances.

In one day, the book (available at http://www.nthposition.com) spread like
wildfire on the Internet, with people around the world reading the works
of these poets, who congregated in one place to beat the antiwar drum.

"What I was hoping to do with this book is contribute to a growing sense
that we're not a minority in opposing this war any more," said Swift, 36,
who was reached by phone yesterday in the French capital where he is
currently living with his fiancée. "In fact, we're becoming a cultural
majority.

"Most Europeans are quite upset by what looks like an aggressive,
unilateral push by the United States for war, at a time when everyone else
wants time for further discussion and more reflection," added Swift.

"I thought, let's move quickly and get something out that inspires and
contains a powerful message. I wanted to let people who are opposed to the
war know they're not alone."

Canadian contributors include Robert Priest, bill bissett, Maggie Helwig,
Di Brandt and George Murray.

The Toronto-born Murray, who now lives in New York, said the 100 Poets
Against the War initiative is important for what it awakens and also for
the values it attempts to instill. "So many people seem to think that the
poet or poetry doesn't have a useful place in society," said Murray, who
contributed his poem The Field.

"But poetry is the oldest form of the evening news, and it used to play a
very critical role politically. First, by disseminating information and
second, by commenting on it.

"This kind of effort, regardless of how valuable each poem is on its own,
as a collection represents a step forward for the kind of activism that
poets need to be part of, that the arts community needs to be part of."

Murray says he just received an e-mail from the American poet Sam Hamill,
who is trying to organize a project similar to Swift's 100 Poets Against
the War.

Hamill was inspired by a letter he received from the White House, which
requested his company at an afternoon reception and symposium on "Poetry
and the American Voice" on Feb. 12. In his e-mail, Hamill told literary
colleagues: "When I picked up my mail and saw the letter marked 'The White
House,' I felt no joy. Rather I was overcome by a kind of nausea."

In his note, Hamill said, "Only the day before I had read a lengthy report
on President Bush's proposed 'Shock and Awe' attack on Iraq, calling for
saturation bombing that would be like the firebombing of Dresden or Tokyo,
killing countless innocent civilians.

"I believe the only legitimate response to such a morally bankrupt and
unconscionable idea is to reconstitute a Poets Against the War movement
like the one organized to speak out against the war in Vietnam." (Hamill
is referring to the 1967 antiwar demonstration that featured leading
literary lights such as Robert Lowell, Allen Ginsberg and Norman Mailer,
who attempted to "levitate" the Pentagon. Mailer later celebrated the
march in his work The Armies of the Night.)

Hamill then asked every poet "to speak up for the conscience of our
country and lend his or her name to our petitition against this war,"
which he plans to present to first lady Laura Bush on Feb. 12, a day he
hopes will become dedicated to poetry against the war.
The field

By George Murray

The sky has been aged, is ancient enough now
to have lost its teeth, clamping one smooth gum

down on the other in a wry horizon's bite.
That the violence we have witnessed

was not random while the kindness was,
how insulting to our attempts at existentialism!

Can we not even frighten ourselves
with philosophy anymore? That intent

could replace randomness as our greatest fear
speaks of how far we've come;

from there to here, from right to just left of right,
from fallen to the lower part of down. The corn

that stretches into the distance,
once an orderly army, has grown slack, wild,

and hoary, each stalk standing at ease
instead of attention, and in a place of its choosing,

bearing those heavy yellow arms in a silence
similar to hushed anticipation. Listen to the wind,

the brewing rain, the field of fire, the flight
of distant machinery, the coded plan of attack.

Dear Friends and Fellow Poets,

The 100 Poets Against The War project continues to gain momentum.
Thank you
for sharing the PDF file and hosting it on your sites.  We have received
excellent coverage in today's Globe and Mail, one of Canada's leading
national papers (see below).  Please do send this along to your local and
national papers in America, the UK, Ireland, Australia and wherever else
you
may be, so that the media will get a sense of how exciting, inspiring and
vital this ongoing story of the power of poetic protest can be.

peace

Todd

For what it's worth,  I heard the tail end of an NPR piece on this
yesterday.  According to the woman being interviewed (the author, I
suppose), the work is based at least partly on interviews with people who
did spend time in these cells.  She said they all "went crazy," partly
because of the narrowness of the cells, partly because of the use of
psychedellic lighting, and partly because of the disorientation brought
about by being confined in such a way that the prisoner's only view was of
the images described in the article.

It's a nice story, but the source appears to be the transcript of a fascist
trial, and Franco's minions could be pretty creative themselves. A 3x6 cell
containing a bed, a bench and an elaborate floor? I'd want to see a picture.

But I can imagine a hallway of these as an art project.

SATURDAY FEB 1 AT THE POETRY PROJECT: POETRY IS NEWS!

[2:00pm - 9:00pm]

***

Operation Counter-Intelligence: A Cultural Wake-Up Call

The world situation (on the insane brink of more war with civil
liberties under siege) is getting worse by the hour. In addition to
everything we do as citizens, we now call for action within the sphere
of all public cultural activities as it becomes increasingly
embarrassing and painful to attend events that don't even "reference"
the current reality. The false dichotomies between politics and
aesthetics can only be put to rest when history is made present and
resistance enacted.

POETRY IS NEWS, a forming cultural coalition announces its inaugural event:

Operation Counter-Intelligence: A Cultural Wake-Up Call
will present panels, performances and reports from the front.

Participants include poets, writers and critics Ammiel Alcalay, Samiya
Bashir, Moustafa Bayoumi, Gabrielle David, Alan Gilbert, Richard Hell,
David Henderson, Fanny Howe, Elias Khoury, Karen Malpede, Michael
Palmer, Anne Waldman and Eliot Weinberger; musician Marc Ribot, special
guest, cartoonist and journalist Ted Rall, and others.

Topics we will address include:

Where Is Poetry? Responding to Crisis
Acting in Public: Expanding Cultural Space
Bringing Back the World
Being Censored, Censoring Ourselves

Reports from the front include:

Rebecca Murray, an International Solidarity Movement
activist, on her experiences riding ambulances in Jenin

Sara Reisman, on demonstrations she has
organized in front of the INS building

Kristin Prevallet and Rachel Levitsky on Debunker
Mentality, public poetry actions taken after 9/11

Rachel McKeen on Brooklyn high school kids'
reactions to military recruitment

Count:0 from Free103point9 on Urban Radio

Admission is FREE

<< By the way, I'm reading that the
Confessional Poets, especially Plath, are making a big comeback.  There's a
film on Plath in the works starring Gwinyth Paltrow (or however her name is
spelled).  Best, Bill >>

oh man, not HER playing Plath!  oh well.
i always liked Sexton more than Plath anyway.
love how Sexton appears in POEMS FOR THE MILLENNIUM (her Jesus Papers i
believe) and none of the others:  Plath, Berryman, Lowell.
Sexton, ironically, was the one being chipped away
over the past 20 years by the Norton's people until
she disappeared.  what was that i ask you?
my feeling has ALWAYS been that Sexton was
the one without all the education, the one with
no credentials outside of a therapist's PUSH in
the direction of poetry.  yet Sexton was always
the authentic voice with little care whether or
not she offended.  in fact, she probably looked
for newer and newer ways TO OFFEND.

i recall a PBS series on poets i saw as a kid.  when they focused on Plath
they mentioned her influences as being male poets, her asshole husband for
one, and TS Eliot, and others.  but they never mentioned Sexton as an
influence.  and that's just ridiculous!  when those two women met in Lowell's
workshop in '59, it really jolted Plath.  you can see it for yourself in the
letters they wrote to one another, how Plath didn't really know what the
possibilities of writing could be for a woman until she met Sexton.  how
could she, with that no-necked small-dicked monster-husband Ted Hughes
breathing down her neck with one foot on her coattails.  if there's ONE poet
i intend to do a drag poetry reading of in this lifetime it's Anne Sexton!
smoking and being a bad-assed sexy woman on stage reading poems about
Christ's mournful cock and melting refrigerators should be the goal of any
decent drag queen worth their salty salt!  Valley of the Dolls meets Harvard!
 YEAH!  sexy, juicy juice and a shot of vodka!

there are plenty of poets who like to trash Sexton, say she's too easy.
besides the fact that i disagree, her poems have made a lot of faces twitch
and shift while reading as i've observed over the years.

there's folks who are upset about the comeback of the Confessionalists.  but
i say, hey, just in time for Blog time.  and why not?  only this time,
instead of all the poets killing themselves, bridges, ovens, gassed in
mother's furs and pearls, this time we'll celebrate, and laugh a little more
because someone's got to balance the budget on suicide.

when down in DC for the march recently with a bunch of amazing Philadelphia
poets, i was surprised to see NO poets on stage, except for Patti Smith, who
sang her anthem PEOPLE HAVE THE POWER!  poets such as Anne Waldman in the
audience, listening with the rest of us to hours of sometimes interesting,
but mostly redundant speeches.  poets are ESSENTIAL to formulating the
language of change.  i had thought about asking Waldman if we should storm
the stage and insist they put her up there, but i don't know this woman, so
just sang along with Patti Smith like everyone else.

next march, next meeting, next uprising we need to gather the hordes of
AMAZING young genius poets all over this country, fresh with outrage!

load the post-post modern rifles audrey, there's 'confessionalists' in them
thar hills!!!

yeah! this is the best !@#$!ing post i've seen in a while.

i have to admit to feeling a bit of a sense of foreboding -- kneejerk
reaction -- when i saw the original post: "The Confessionalists are coming
back!" my god! Noooooooooooooooo!

but this post made me realize, yeah, bring em on! (and if it takes Gwenyth
Paltrow to bring back plath, well, all I can say is, I want Morgan Freeman
to play me in the movie)...

after all, i've been deeply enjoying some vintage theodore roethke late at
night, when i think no one's looking, so to cringe at the thought of a
resurgence of plath/sexton/et al., well, it couldn't be much worse than the
various strains in vogue now.

i have no point. rock on.

If any of you still have Terry Gross coming up today in your local NPR
programming, I strongly suggesting listening to her interview with the
co-author of Carnegie's response to the Blix report on the Inspections. I
won't attempt to paraphrase, but I think his viewpoint is quite useful in
terms of framing the current situation - and particularly perceptive on the
potential horrific and self-destructive consequences of the messianic
embrace of certain pro-invasion/occupation Administration members (Perle,
Wolflitz).

One of the advantages of working as a poet in an offmarket community is =
that people can [and do] respond to poetry without the diminishing =
weight of the latest shifts of taste and the asides that often echo =
tastemakers' approval. Poet's theater has been an irregular, but not =
infrequent, constant in Toledo. Individuals read the available =
biographies, write a script, reherse and stage a performance of the work =
of writers they appreciate. Anne Sexton, Dave Etter and Jack Kerouac are =
three poets whose texts have formed the basis for the individual shows =
"Her Kind," "Heartland" and "Back to Jack." The six woman cast of "Her =
Kind" [all red-dressed Annes tippling showy martini glasses] performed =
that particular poet's theater at 4 crowded venues--a downtown club, a =
university women's conference, a bookstore and the Toledo Museum of Art. =
I don't think anyone realized the poetry was out of favor and had =
slipped off the approved charts. The intertextual scripting was =
documentary and informational, the poems ranged across the contents of =
her books, there were joyous practices reading the poems to one another, =
shifting choices and players. Staging required a few props and a touch =
of music. JL

Can I be helped?: I'm trying to hunt down a phrase by Baraka regarding
Kamau Brathwaite. I can't find a provenance for it and I need to cite it
for something.

Somewhere Baraka says about Brathwaite:"One of the most important poets of
the Western Hemisphere." Anyone know where he says that? I saw it in the
last two months, but a tsunami of books has washed across my desk since
early December -- such tath I can't remember in what book or mag I might

Very True Story:
Abt a month ago two friends of mine took a guided tour of the Library
of Congress. The President is allowed to check books out of the
library (I was once arrested and penned up in Metro DC's Central Cell
Block for supposedly stealing a volume of Sappho from the LoC, but
that's another story). So one of my friends asked the tour guide:
"Did Bill Clinton use the library often?" And the guide proudly
replied: "Yes, he wd come in almost every week. He read an average of
six books a week!" My friend: "What abt President Bush?" The guide's
smile faded and, after a long pause, he replied: "Well, I'd like to
keep my job and so I don't think I can really answer that." and
recommenced the tour.

Perhaps somewhat in the spirit of Juliana Spahr's post
about  Cybergraphia, the on-line symposium on the
pedagogy of teaching contemporary poetry (more

Would be curious about others' impressions.

dawned on me and has been sticking since, as a sort of
odd, new template I keep reading poetry though.

Reading Davis' poems there, I was struck by ~the
simplicity~ of the vocabulary.  It seemed, upon first
impression, that, except for gerunds ("-ing" words) or
plurals or "-ed" words, it was almost all one- or
two-syllable words.

That's not entirely true, on further inspection.
There are in fact a little more than a hundred
polysyllables in the six pages of poetry.. (I've
learned afterwards that in [on-line] reading level
material, it's only three-syllable words or longer
that are to be called "polysyllables", in the context
that follows.)  What may have lent to that impression
was the somewhat childhood-oriented, nursery rhyme
themes of the poems ("foxes steal gold mice", "shining
bar of soap", "The ice cream barking all night the
piano running past", "A Little Gold Book", etc).  At
any rate, ---and I do not mean this as a condemnation
or condescension toward Davis' poetry--- I was left
with the feeling that this was an entirely different
reading experience than reading, say, Drew Gardner's
~Sugar Pill,~ with its penchant for science textbook
terminology, to name only one strain, or, certainly,
Kevin Davies' ~Comp.~ ("The entire panoply of
minimalist histrionics").  I had the sense that, aside
from the "difficulties" (new reading dissonances) that
the disjunctiveness and other Modernist/post-modernist
techniques introduce, a child would have no trouble
reading most of it ("My old love ripped off of me like
an apple / I am dying to see you / To carry you like
an age into wood / . . . / Rain off the bridge /
Searching with a bell").  (There is, of course, some
more "adult" vocabulary that requires a different
level of education/information, such as "milltowns"
[which I interpret to be the Valley of the Dolls
tranquilizer], "tagalog", "magnums", etc.)

I was left wondering if (1) we assume about the
cognitive-interpretive dissonances which disjunction,
parataxis, etc., instill that they are basically equal
in their effect and the same whether you're 25 or 45,
or, in this case, 25 or 15, then (2), aside from that
"difficulty," the differences between any two poets
may additionally come down to ~what reading level~ of
challenge they present.

(I in fact do not believe in assumption (1), and feel
that, the more acculturated one becomes to such
poetry, the different effects of different tropes is
essential to the pleasure of the reading.  For a good
while, though, or in poetry of overload, these more
subtle distinctions can blur together and assumption
(1) may be accurate in some basic way.)

In comparison, think of the vocabulary in, say,
Ashbery's ~Daffy Duck in Hollywood~ (yes,
unfortunately, one must keep circling back to Ashbery,
 . . . the way '50s painters couldn't get away from
Picasso), where <"La Celestina", "Amadigi di Gaula",
"Escritoire", "déconfit", "the Princesse de Cleves",
"borborygmic", "Aglavaine" and "Sélysette">, etc.,
involve a binge of nose-bleed stratosphere
ultra-sophistication that would keep the best Norton
annotator or undergraduate flipping reference words
and dictionary pages.  The notorious Ashbery
"difficulty", then, becomes a sort of double
difficulty, of not only adjusting to his poetic
ellipticism but to the high-brow ~New York Review of
Books~ mentality that not so coyly peeps through that
primary dissonance.  An uninitiated reader has to
acclimatize her-/himself not only to the new
"challenge" of how contemporary experimental poetry
functions, but to the level of education the text
speaks to, even if it could be rearranged and ironed
out into a normalized, ~conjunct~ rather than disjunct
discursivity.

The different audiences that poets attract might be in
line with these inequalities, too.  Ashbery's
reputation was, to some extent, pushed forward toward
such unparalleled proportions by how that secondary
level of post-doctoral sensibility in his writing
excited critics who aspire toward that very breed of
cosmopolitan erudition.  Davis, meanwhile, at least
from the Buffalo Poetics List reports, is enjoying a
rather rapid and lively appreciation that, the
educational level of the List notwithstanding, sounds
like a sort of "populism" responding.  (I do not know
how ~Million Journal Poems~ continues this streak or
supplants it, and his poems were largely just the
catalyst for these thoughts rather than their prime
example.  At a skim, it's moot how much his
millionpoems.blogspot writing deviates from this.  On
the face of things, "Then pop! / There's nothing wrong
with your rain / Hat on lifted ass. / The subject
looks around the car. Rock and roll" doesn't
especially upgrade the secondary level of challenge.)

In some sense, to their credit, then, perhaps work
like these poems of Davis' allow a more "pure",
interference-free experience of disjunctive
dissonance.  There is no special degree of
unfamiliarity with the content, otherwise, so there's
the potential of a more "clean" effect, as far as the
reverberations that come off of "parataxis."

I find it interesting, though, the possibility that
there might be contemporary work like this very
immediately suited to a readership of high school or
grade school students, since we tend to think of
ourselves as all so beyond that.

Without having checked, I would think that the
popularity of, say, a W.S. Merwin (or a Michael
Palmer) has much to do with this fundamental reading
level of vocabulary.


-------------------------------------------------------


The remainder of this post gets number-fussy and may
be ignored off as a sort of crankier footnote.

An interesting rabbit hole I fell down in pursuing
this idea was the whole question of what constitutes
"reading level" altogether.  I used the Idiot's Guide
approach and checked the Internet.

There's something called the "SMOG reading level" or
Readability Test.  It's all about those three-syllable
or more- words.  (I do not know what "SMOG" stands
for.)

The formula is to take 30 sentences from the beginning
of a text, 30 from the end, and count up the number of
polysyllables.  The formula itself then goes off into
rather arcane calculations involving square root,---
but there's a simpler version, which treats the sheer
count as indicative in and of itself.   The simplified
SMOG conversion table appears at the bottom of
http://www.sph.emory.edu/WELLNESS/reading.html.

It's surprising and sort of disappointing that SMOG
recognizes polysyllables only in and of themselves and
does not distinguish between the reading level
differences between household, substantive
polysyllables like <"(air) conditioner", "marigolds",
"underground", "magazines", "rubber-stamped",
"Jack-o-lanterns" (sic)> (all Davis', ~AAoN(A)P~ p.
30) versus ones like <"credulity", "excommunication",
"perdition", "internal", "derangement">. (all
Gardner's, p. 50f), the way it levels the playing
field of educational differences that result from
information (cultural capital).  Obviously, a more
"advanced" lesson plan or cultural-intellectual
attainment would be required for the latter.

It's somewhat free rein how to apply the SMOG to
poetry, which, unpunctuated and run-on, may not even
be comprised of "sentences".  Should you could up 30
lines, instead? Should it just be applied to the total
text?--- But, regardless, the three shorter of Davis'
poems there each contain 8, 5, and 5 polysyllables.
That places them on a 6th or 5th grade reading level,
basically.  The long poem, "A Little Golden Book" (my
counting mania set in) contains about 52
polysyllables, which, over all, might be a 10th grade
reading level (although that's something of a
misapplication of the SMOG rule.   The 12 and 9
polysyllables in the poem's first and last 30 lines
would be an 8th grade reading level (still high).  The
poem of Davis' that David Shapiro chose for the Boston
Review (see on-line version), which was basically a
broader audience's first introduction to his poetry,
is about the same numbers, 46 total for a 10th grade
reading level, or a beginning/ending 6 and 4 for a 6th
grade reading level.

There may be a metrical-musical side to this.
Polysyllables seem to come in waves, in this limited
sample of Davis poems: whereas there may be a roughly
even distribution across "A Little Gold Book" (almost
never two in one line, but sometimes clumped up in a
peak distribution, like the 10 polysyllables in the
last six lines on ~AAoN(A)P~ p. 32), he's also prone
to sizeable stretches withholding any at all, such as
the range of fifteen lines that straddle from p. 30
into p. 31, the ten lines at the top of p. 33, etc.
The Boston Review poems can be read similarly with
whole sequences of stanzas going polysyllable-free.

This may also not be atypical.  Or, it may be typical
of the age demographic that ~AAoN(A)P~  chose.  The
seven Gardner poems in the same anthology (3, 20, 5,
12, 6, 14, and 5 polysyllables each) SMOG-clock in
with four poems at a 5th grade reading level, one at a
6th, and two at a 7th.  Clearly (at the risk of
betraying bias here), some subsequent differentation
would have to be made between the supplementary
educational-conceptual levels of vocabulary like
<"bewilderment", "salamander", "opposition",
"coinciding", "subjectivity", "unconsciously",
"perceptible", "individual", "absolute",
"disaffected", "intentions">, and vocabulary like
<"photography", "employers", "pyramid", "meteors",
"museum", "surgery", "zinnias", "helicopters",
"basketballs", "propellor", "lullabyes", "mosquito">.

-------------------------------------------------------

              This doesn't have to do
              With truth value or even
              Meaningful probability

              Whether true or false

I just took the time to read the Amazon comment.  If this guy is in fact a
PhD from Brown it desreves condolences, not so much because of his opinions
as for his writing skills. But hey, it's one guy. A pity Amazon saw fit to
place his comments first.

Gabe has perfect pitch, and he's very funny.  Like Chaucer, he probably
lacks high seriousness.  One can only be grateful.

Zoosemiotics

Flash 6

Speakers On
Statement: Zoosemiotics
Formally considered, Zoosemiotics is about juxtaposition and variability. Its music, its text, its sequence and its texture all rely either on algorithmic procedures or intuition to lend it its unique look, sound and operation. It's my hope that the user interacts with the piece much as one would interact with a game; that is, that each manifestation of Zoosemiotics is a wading out into the depths of chance and discovery.
The work is a collection of nine frames or performance spaces, cycled through in a random sequence. Some frames are interactive; some are cinematic. A good hint as to the interactivity of a given space is the visibility or invisibility of the mouse pointer; if you can see the mouse, the piece requires input. Some of the interactive spaces have explicit instructions; others invite you to explore, by clicking and moving your mouse.
The music for the work mixes itself at random at runtime. Some of the sources for sound loops are Bartok, Webern, Spiritualized, Charles Mingus, Joy Division, The Jesus and Mary Chain and John Coltrane, among others. All of these loops were heavily edited to yield new textures from at times canonical material.
The text, as well, is algorithmically selected. Substrings are snipped at random from a collection of ten paragraphs. These paragraphs also come from various sources: Ron Silliman's blog, Petronious' Satyricon, the Clonaid website, a post to the Buffalo Poetics list by Patrick Herron, some texts on genetic engineering, etc. These are the raw materials on which the algorithm works. The results at times can seem asemic, and the text shifts continually, but this is part of Zoosemiotics' overall thematic concern; the barrage of communication, both biological and textual, in the early twenty-first century.
The tools used to create this work varied: Macromedia Flash MX for the final file; Adobe Photoshop for image-editing and compositing; Adobe Premiere for video manipulation; Electric Rain Swift3D for 3D animation; Syntrillium Cool Edit and Sonic Foundry Acid Pro for sound.

I sent the article to a former professor of mine who taught me a lot about
things surrealismish and anarchistish.

his response to my header, "this is interesting":


Yes, very.  I had not heard of these experiments in incarceration, but I
am suspicious of this report.  Firstly, the anarchists in Spain were
against all forms of institution, so it`s hard to imagine them having
prisons in the first place, let alone the kind of mind-bending
experiments set out in the article.  As non-conformist as this
experiment sounds, its aim is nonetheless to make the prisoner abandon
"subversive" thinking and hew to an (anarchist) party-line.  The passing
reference to similar experiments in Franco`s jails (though not using
modern art) may point to the motivation for the appearance of this
bizarre piece.  Documentary material from the later (and more brutal)
period of the Spanish Civil War must now be coming available... And I`m
sure there are Franco supporters who will not want that damaging
material bursting on the media scene without some kind of pre-emptive
softening strike.  Did I mention that I was suspicious?

It's been a while since anyone tried to initiate a discussion about an actual book of poems.  It would be nice to get back to that.  Here's the URL for Jordan Davis's book:

http://www.fauxpress.com/b/jd.htm

But it might be easier, Jeffrey, if you were to quote a poem or two or perhaps provide a link.

I know that the social significance of diction has been discussed in relation to Language writing (quotation of theoryspeak = appeal to academic audience), but Jordan's intentionally vivid and simple (or "naive"?) diction seems opposed to that idea of institutionally authoritative speech.  His diction/vocabulary seems to go with the persona in the poems.  But I don't know his work well at all.

Ange Mlinko refers to his "little-boy exuberance": that what you mean by childlike speech and lower reading levels?

I just took the time to read the Amazon comment.  If this guy is in fact
a
PhD from Brown it desreves condolences, not so much because of his
opinions
as for his writing skills. But hey, it's one guy. A pity Amazon saw fit
to
place his comments first.

Gabe has perfect pitch, and he's very funny.  Like Chaucer, he probably
lacks high seriousness.  One can only be grateful.

Dear Friends: I want report some remarkable changes that will be
occurring to Rattapallax in 2003. As some of you know, we are publishing
an entire issue (spring 2003) dedicated to 'New Brazilian and American
Poetry.'  I was recently in Brazil to record the poets with Flavia Rocha
(one of the issue's editors) and was able to setup a major partnership
with Editora34 (Brazil's leading literary publisher), who will
distribute future issues of the magazine in Brazil.  In addition, we are
working on two major readings in Sao Paulo for June 2003.

Another major change with Rattapallax is that we will expand the focus
of the magazine into world poetry and world music. Derek Beres (managing
editor of Global Rhythm magazine) will be joining our staff as our music
editor. Together, we will focus on musicians with strong poetic
traditions and print their lyrics and include their songs on the CD. For
example, the Brazilian issue focuses on Caetano Veloso, Arto Lindsay,
Arnaldo Antunes and others. The fall 2003 issue will focus on MC Solaar
and French hip-hop; as well as contemporary French poets V=E9nus
Khoury-Ghata and Claire Malroux.

But, this should NOT be mistaken that we are no longer a literary
journal. Martin Mitchell will continue to edit the poetry and Alan
Cheuse will edit the fiction.  Martin and Alan are remarkable editors
and have helped to bring the magazine to its current circulation and
respectability.  Joining them as editors will be Edwin Torres (co-edited
the spring 2003 issue), Willie Perdomo, Flavia Rocha, Jeet Thayil, and
international poetry editor Marilyn Hacker.  In addition, there are many
contributing editors who will be assisting us from around the world. I
am also working on distribution in the UK and France.

Why change? Why Brazil?
Brazil is South America's largest economy and the 9th largest in the
world. In my opinion, it is also the cultural center of South America
and in the next ten years will be a major presence in the world.  With
this partnership, Rattapallax will be one of the biggest literary
magazines in Brazil and will have better distribution than most local
journals. The
expansion into world poetry and music is a natural compliment to our UN
and world programs. I also believe world music is the next progression
for the music industry as they adjust to 'globalization' and the fusion
of different cultures and arts.

Boîte en forme de coeur (French Remix)


Build another library to fill (perform) the need or the head
to pursue the elusive heat in caves and liquids

I do not look for boredom, I want the buckles of bone,
give me the entertainment of the updated skins,

the (substantial) material malpractice.

You are welcome at a new age of diamond,

brought to us according to accidents

an American foot, an Icelander darken the zodiacs,
meters to go

only Dick can go in China

let me be liaison in the new Hut Yummy, let them eat false combos.

premonitions smell *real* and being worth him (it)

gristle, I do not want to die with you,

because of you we applaud for the empire, again,

to crush very patient

dangers called on Tuesday, nets abound

Greetings fellow P-Listers.

Recently I have been using an online cutup machine at speakeasy.org run by Lee Worden. My intention was to use it as the basis for a series of poems, but alas the site seems to have "disappeared" into that place that dead webpages go when they move on to a better place.

Now my hands are up in the air, as all the online text randomisers I have sought on my trusty Google searches have turned up nada.

If anyone can turn my direction towards that of a reliable online cutup machine, or even tell me how to contact Lee Worden, please back channel a message to me.

Thank you.



Michael Bogue

Michael Bogue:

Florian Cramer's on-line cut-up machine at

http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~cantsin/permutations/gysin/cut-up.cgi

is sensational and my favorite.  It cuts into up to 7
columns (i.e., total mishmash).  You can also direct
it to a URL and it'll cut-up that designated web site.

If you didn't see my January 8th post or couldn't
interpret what my collage at

http://jeffreyjullich.tripod.com/CUT-UPforweb.jpg

was (or didn't care!  an illegibly one-line
transcription of it followed in the post, with all the
inter-word spacing removed), it's a hands-on physical
scissors-&-Scotch cut-up from various pulp novels that
I bought at a Salvation Army thrift shop:

Dan Simmons' ~Hyperion~ (Specter/Bantam), Don
Pendleton's ~Mack Bolan Stony Man VII~ (Gold Eagle),
Carol O'Connell's ~Mallory's Oracle~ (Jove), and James
N. Pruitt's ~Striker One Down~ (A Tom Doherty
Associates Book), all of which I bought for expressly
that purpose and for the kitsch of their air-brushed
picaresque covers.

I found the result to be wonderful in combination with
(1st) scanning and then (2nd) feeding scan into OCR
(optical character recognition), that is, scan
re-processing into straight text.  Playing that
typography text back through free downloadable
ReadPlease text-to-voice software added an acoustical
"sound poetry" layer to it, for one enjoyable busy
afternoon.  An un-unilinearized excerpt follows below
(although I'm no longer sure if it's from the same
collage).

The only defect I found lacking in the process was the
residue of my still being the one doing the hands-on
work of the selection, scissoring and pasting
(although I enjoyed the physical therapy of it all.  I
Photoshop-superimposed those .jpgs of buttons over the
collage, with Drop Shadow added, as ~~an especially
clever touch~~ punning on the web/Macromedia jargon of
"buttons").  Where I wanted to go next was to ~hire~
somebody, some puckish ne'er-do-well, if such could be
trusted (with scissors!), maybe for minimum wage or
piece-meal, allow him the choice of which pulp novels
he'd buy to collect from, ---maybe I'd have to okay
the covers before cut-up started--- and leave it all
up to him.  But to sign the work as my own ("by
Jeffrey Jullich").  A kind of literary Shirley
Levine-ism.

(If anyone dexterous with scissors in Manhattan is
looking for a few extra dollars, back-channel.)

Enjoy.

"Senior Administration Official: Again, the fundamental issue is, does the
country support the use of force to disarm Saddam Hussein. And the other
issues such as timing et cetera, it really comes down to whether or not the
country trusts President Bush's judgment, knowing that he knows a lot more
than the country knows. And again, the President -- if zero percent of the
country supported this and the President thought it was necessary to protect
the country, he would make the judgments that he thought were in the
country's interest."

So much for "the (informed) consent of the governed."

I don't know about others here - unless the quiet speaks anxious volumes -
this has been one troubling post state-of-the-"union" day.

Excerpt:

1. His budget commits "an additional $400 billion over the next decade to reform
 and strengthen Medicare."
2. He will "continue to seek peace between a secure Israel and a democratic
Palestine."
3. His team is "working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks."
4. He is "instructing the leaders of the FBI, the CIA, the Homeland Security and
 the Department of Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center."
5. Colin Powell will "ask the U.N. Security Council to convene on February the
5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world."

That's about it. Anything else is on a wish list or being extended to us as an
F.Y.I. item. My primary concern with all of the above is that it's such a
ham-handed attempt at a finesse. It is precisely the same kind of marketing and
psychology massage you get every time you see a commercial. This isn't
communication, it's manipulation, and I hate to be treated like that. I'll bet
you don't like it much, either.

Curator's Note:

Quotes from a favorite book relevant to a view of art, literature, the
making of poetry, however speaking to the building of buildings:

"The search which we make for this quality, in our own lives, is the central
search of any person, and the crux of any individual person's story. It is
the search for those moments and situations when we are most alive."


Opening to Chapter 3 ON BEING ALIVE of "The Timeless Way of Building" by
Christopher Alexander


"And when a building has this fire, then it becomes a part of nature. Like
ocean waves, or blades of grass, its parts are governed by the endless play
of repetition and variety, created in the presence of the fact that all
things pass. This is quality itself."


Opening to Chapter 8 THE QUALITY ITSELF of "The Timeless Way of Building" by
Christopher Alexander

Choking Victim


do you feel sick?  I feel sick

the automatic pilot is on
there are waitresses, projecting pangs

we're provoking combative nations
and I feel sick

in dreamy fugue, nothing can compel
up or down the tiresome staircases

so much dizziness with none of the
heavy drinking, c'mon, let's move to Tokyo

do you feel sick?  or *sicker*?
or is it me

drifting leisurely between dimensions
hoping for blue flux to becalm
once and for all

if we had all of the answers it might
be fun, being in on the joke

at rest in diners, thinking eternity
or huevos rancheros?

Are you OK?  I feel sick
under the nose of the G.O.P. expecting
ruin, but instead it's really funny

Pabst Blue Poem


life begins at perception, I'm

strolls to bars and smiles from
people in bars.  here's a fact: bars

have saved my life most nights.
I woke up yesterday and it was

would have to invent bars.

this could have been a poem about
babysitters, but I really dug Anselm's.

pick any late night destination
and try sleepwalking this time
or sleephitchhiking, which might
be illegal.

I'm helpless with girls, especially
dead girls.

dead girls don't get out much
or return calls.

I think about dead girls in
funeral parlors, which are less fun then
bars.

White House Cancels Poetry Symposium

Thursday January 30, 2003 10:20 AM


NEW YORK (AP) - The White House postponed a poetry symposium out of
concerns it would be politicized after some poets said they wanted to
protest military action against Iraq.

The symposium on the poetry of Emily Dickinson, Langston Hughes and Walt
Whitman had been scheduled for Feb. 12. No future date has been
announced for the event, to be held by first lady Laura Bush.

``While Mrs. Bush respects the right of all Americans to express their
opinions, she, too, has opinions and believes it would be inappropriate
to turn a literary event into a political forum,'' Noelia Rodriguez, a
spokeswoman for the first lady, said Wednesday.

Mrs. Bush, a former librarian who has made teaching and early childhood
development her signature issues, has held a series of White House
symposiums to salute America's authors. The gatherings are usually
lively affairs with discussions of literature and its impact on society.


But the poetry symposium quickly inspired a nationwide protest. Sam
Hamill, a poet and editor of the highly regarded Copper Canyon Press,
declined the invitation and e-mailed friends asking for antiwar poems or
statements.

``Make February 12 a day of Poetry Against the War. We will compile an
anthology of protest to be presented to the White House on that
afternoon,'' the e-mail reads.

He had expected about 50 responses; he's gotten more than 1,500,
including contributions from W.S. Merwin, Adrienne Rich and Lawrence
Ferlinghetti. Hamill will post all the submissions on a Web site he
expects to have ready early next week.

``I'm putting in 18-hour days. I'm 60 and I'm tired, but it's pretty
wonderful,'' says Hamill, author of such works as ``Destination Zero''
and ``Gratitude.'' Copper Canyon Press, based in Port Townsend, Wash.,
published last fall's winner of the National Book Award for poetry, Ruth
Stone's ``In the Next Galaxy.''

White House invitations have inspired protests before. In 1965, poet
Robert Lowell refused to attend a White House arts festival, citing
opposition to the Vietnam War.

Marilyn Nelson, Connecticut's poet laureate, said Wednesday she had
accepted her invitation to the poetry symposium and criticized the White
House for trying to silence the voice of American artists.

``I had decided to go because I felt my presence would promote peace,''
she said. ``I had commissioned a fabric artist for a silk scarf with
peace signs painted on it. I thought just by going there and shaking
Mrs. Bush's hand and being available for the photo ops, my scarf would
make a statement.''

Another state poet laureate, New Jersey's Amiri Baraka, was also
involved in a recent political controversy. Baraka wrote a poem implying
Israel had advance knowledge of the 2001 terrorist attacks, leading
critics to call for his resignation.

Jeffrey,
You write:
"I find it interesting, though, the possibility that
there might be contemporary work like this very
immediately suited to a readership of high school or
grade school students, since we tend to think of
ourselves as all so beyond that."

At the high school level, I have had success teaching Jordan Davis' poem
"W". Its playful, fragmented discussion of monsters helps open up
discussions about the "monsters" in _Beowulf_, _Grendel_, _Frankenstein_,
_Lord of the Flies_, "The Second Coming," "Tyger," etc. (all h.s. staples).
"W" seems to work because the poem's vocabulary & concepts are clear &
accesible, so once students get somewhat comfortable w/ (or perhaps
trust-the-legitimacy(?) of) how the poem is put together (how the syntax
works), they are often able to talk about issues that though relevant to all
lit. don't often come up in an h.s. classroom. For example, they talk about
the surface of the language & about how the singularity, sincerity, etc.,
etc. of the speaker (the speaker's relationship to the spoken) in Davis'
poem is slippery, making any statement's meaning slippery. This recognition
by students opens up the text (& other texts by association) and makes for
wide-ranging & fertile discussions.
There's more to be said on this, I think, but that'll have to be it for now.
all the best,
j.c.

THE POETRY IS NEWS COALITION

embarrassing and painful to attend events that don't even "reference"
the current reality. The false dichotomies between politics and
aesthetics can only be put to rest when history is made present and
resistance enacted.

Hello all,

After publishing eight issues of ixnay magazine and six chapbooks over the
last five years, ixnay press is pleased to announce the publication of the
first volume of the ixnay reader, an ongoing mini-anthology that will appear
approximately once each year. Volume one features between 10 and 35 pages of
new work from each of its eight contributors:

Allison Cobb  /  Frank Sherlock  /  Elizabeth Treadwell  /  Brian Lucas
     Marcella Durand  / Matt Hart  /  Ethel Rackin  /  Brett Evans

Perfect-bound, 152 pages, a mere $6. Please make checks payable to Chris
McCreary, not the press itself. You can order via email at ixnaypress@aol.com
or mail at ixnay press, c/o McCreary, 1328 Tasker St, Phila PA 19148.

Please also note that last summer's issue of poppycock, our occasional
newsletter of reviews and interviews, is now available at our website
(www.durationpress.com/ixnay) as a free pdf file. It features Don Riggs on
Pattie McCarthy's bk of (h)rs, Ethel Rackin on Rachel Blau DuPlessis's Drafts
1-38, Toll, Alicia Askenase on Hank Lazer's Days, and CAConrad on Heather
Fuller's Dovecote, as well as an interview with Marcella Durand and a new
poem by Mariana Ruiz-Firmat. And the price, as they say, is right.

Thanks much.

Anti-war poets force scrapping of White House symposium

Sarah Left
Thursday January 30, 2003

The White House yesterday confirmed that it had cancelled a poetry symposium
after a number of American poets threatened to turn the event into an anti-war
protest.

The February 12 symposium on Poetry and the American Voice, which was meant to
focus on the works of Emily Dickinson, Langston Hughes and Walt Whitman, was
one of a number of literary gatherings organised by the first lady, Laura Bush.

When Washington-based poet Sam Hamill received an invitation to the event, he
said he was "overcome by a kind of nausea" and refused to attend. Then he
decided to email fellow poets, asking them to compose anti-war works and urging
anyone attending the symposium to read works of protest.

Explaining the cancellation, Noelia Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for Mrs Bush,
said: "While Mrs Bush respects the right of all Americans to express their
opinions, she, too, has opinions, and believes it would be inappropriate to
turn a literary event into a political forum."

A former librarian, the first lady has made teaching and early childhood
development her signature issues. Her series of White House symposiums to
salute America's authors have been lively affairs, featuring discussions about
literature and its impact on society.

No future date for the poetry event has been announced.

Mr Hamill, a co-founder of Copper Canyon Press, set up a website in a bid to
turn February 12 into Poetry Against the War day. He said that he had received
poems or personal statements from more than 2,000 poets during the last week,
and plans to present an anthology of the poems to the White House.

In an open letter on the site, Mr Hamill explained: "I believe the only
legitimate response to such a morally bankrupt and unconscionable idea is to
reconstitute a Poets Against the War movement like the one organised to speak
out against the war in Vietnam."

Contributors have included WS Merwin, Galway Kinnell, Ursula K Le Guin,
Adrienne Rich and Lawrence Ferlinghetti.

"I'm putting in 18-hour days. I'm 60 and I'm tired, but it's pretty wonderful,"
said Mr Hamill.

Marilyn Nelson, Connecticut's poet laureate, said that she had accepted the
White House invitation, and had planned to wear a specially-commissioned silk
scarf with peace signs.

"I had decided to go because I felt my presence would promote peace," she said.

Mr Hamill's more forthright form of protest, however, may have tipped the
balance for White House planners, however. He told the Seattle Times: "What
idiot thought Sam Hamill would be a good candidate for Laura Bush's tea party?
Someone's going to get fired over this."

His is not the only protest in verse. Canadian poet Todd Swift took only one
week to compile an ebook, 100 Poets Against the War, which he released on
Monday to mark the report by weapons inspectors to the UN security council.

"We're trying to create something that is like the Vietnam war protest," said
Mr Swift, speaking from his home in Paris. He said he was amazed by how quickly
the collection had spread around the world.

"About 25 of the poets in the collection are from the UK or Ireland, and we are
adding John Kinsella and a few others this weekend to the revised version,
which will be released next Monday to meet Mr Blair on his return from Bush's
ranch," he added.

Contributors to the ebook include George Murray, Ethan Gilsdorf and Maggie
Helwig.

State of the Union, 2003

I have not been to Jerusalem,
but Shirley talks about the bombs.
I have no god, but have seen the children praying
for it to stop. They pray to different gods.
The news is all old news again, repeated
like a bad habit, cheap tobacco, the social lie.


The children have seen so much death
that death means nothing to them now.
They wait in line for bread.
They wait in line for water.
Their eyes are black moons reflecting emptiness.
We've seen them a thousand times.


Soon, the president will speak.
He will have something to say about bombs
and freedom and our way of life.
I will turn the TV off. I always do.
Because I can't bear to look
at the monuments in his eyes.


Sam Hamill

This is sad news. I feel nostalgic, remembering his Moby Dick
lecture (one grabbing hand gesture saying it all), a version given at S.U.C.
@ Fredonia in the early seventies.

And I found his poetry as robust as the man himself. I
hope his cracklings pass well through the Western Door.

Dear Friends, a forward from my sister , Andy....  how to fight as the war
machine churns onward???

    Those without money have less access to the media.  Even if they do have
money their ads may be refused...thus the medical industry got to the media
so they did not air single payer ads or even ads in favor of the Clinton
Health plan.   Here is another example.


Tell Mitchell Schmale to stop censoring war ads!

Background:  Comcast is censoring ads in tonight¹s state of the union (see

Anti-War Ads Rejected During Bush Speech

By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. - The Comcast cable television company rejected ads that
an anti-war group wanted to air during President Bush (news - web sites)'s
State of the Union speech, saying they included unsubstantiated claims.

Peace Action Education Fund had spent $5,000 to have six 30-second ads aired
on CNN by Philadelphia-based Comcast beginning Tuesday night. During his
speech, Bush was expected to reiterate his case for war.

The ads were to be broadcast in the Washington, D.C., area. But Comcast's
legal department notified the group Tuesday morning that the ads would not
air.

"Comcast runs advertisements from many sources representing a wide range of
viewpoints, pro and con," Comcast spokesman Mitchell Schmale said in a
statement issued Tuesday evening. "However, we must decline to run any spot
that fails to substantiate certain claims or charges. In our view, this spot
raises such questions."

The statement did not specify what Comcast, the nation's largest cable
company, objected to.

The ads show citizens expressing opposition to war with Iraq and were to run
twice on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights.

The idea was to reach Congress members, Cabinet members and other Washington
decision makers, said the Rev. Robert Moore, executive director of the
2,000-member peace group, which is based in Princeton.

"This is an outrageous infringement on our First Amendment rights, in the
center of our democracy, Washington, D.C.," he said.

PLEASE FORWARD!!!

Browbeat, Phlog'em & Harras'em, as this firm was known in the Bay Area,
was oft' called the law firm of poets because, for many years, its
proofreading department consisted of many a writer: Bob Grenier, Tinker
Greene, John Clark (Tom's kid bro) & I think possibly Erica Hunt, all
worked there at different moments in time. Only ComputerLand & the
administrative staff at UC Berkeley employed more poets in the 1980s &

West Coast Law Firm Closing After Dot-Com Collapse
By JONATHAN GLATER


Partners at the San Francisco law firm of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison
decided yesterday to wind down the firm, bringing to an end a
77-year-old Bay Area institution that rose flamboyantly and rapidly on
the Internet boom.

The decision came after efforts to merge with Morgan Lewis & Bockius - a
1,100-lawyer firm whose largest offices are in Philadelphia, Washington
and New York - failed on Wednesday, said William Sullivan, who is head
of the national securities practice at Brobeck.

"That caused us to look at all the issues and see where we are," Mr.
Sullivan said. He said the firm would meet with its lenders today and
try to determine how it could go about an orderly, gradual winding up of
its affairs. "What it means is that we'll work with Citibank to get them
paid and probably have partners and others move to other firms."

The announcement is remarkable for a firm whose lawyers in recent years
boasted that they represented the future of the legal business and
criticized their New York competitors as too slow to serve nimble
start-up technology companies and Internet ventures. The firm had
invested millions of dollars in television advertising.

The firm broke the news to its associates in an afternoon
videoconference, said one Brobeck lawyer, speaking on the condition that
he not be identified. Further announcements are expected today, the
lawyer said.

The firm may not technically dissolve even though it may cease operating
as a single unit as its lawyers leave, Mr. Sullivan said. He added that
a priority would be ensuring that clients were not hurt by events at
Brobeck.

"It is a stunning and incredible tragedy," said Barry S. Levin, chairman
of Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe, another San Francisco firm. "A lot
of people are going to want to understand how a firm of the stature of
Brobeck could end up dissolving. Whether it's the Internet boom or
growing too fast for the volume of work or too much emphasis on one
practice area, I don't know."

Brobeck employs just over 500 lawyers around the country, down from more
than 900 in 2000; it lost nearly one-third of its lawyers last year.
Although the firm was founded in 1926 - making it ancient in the San
Francisco legal market - it became far more prominent in the late 1990's
during the dot-com boom. It grew rapidly by hiring law school graduates
eager to live in San Francisco and work on the fringes of the
high-technology economy.

Its partners took home nearly $1.2 million each, on average, in 2000.
The firm was also one of the first to offer lawyers fresh out of law
school salaries on par with those paid by New York law firms - as much
as $125,000.

But those hefty salaries left Brobeck with high costs, and as some of
the firm's clients stopped selling their stock, merging or in some cases
operating, the firm found itself in an increasingly difficult position.
While Brobeck has as clients a number of big companies, including Cisco
Systems, Compaq and Gap, it tried to diversify its customer base too
late, lawyers at other firms said.

Brobeck was an innovator among law firms, said Charles Maddock, a
principal at Altman Weil, a consulting firm that advises law firms. "One
of the things that they did was spend more than $10 million in corporate
television advertising, when no one was doing that," he said. "That's a
big investment."

Brobeck has suffered defections of some partners over the last year,
some as recently as this week. The former chairman, Tower C. Snow, led
nearly two dozen lawyers early last summer to join Clifford Chance, a
British firm that previously did not have an office in San Francisco.
Brobeck's other partners had terminated Mr. Snow when they learned that
he was negotiating with Clifford Chance.

Mr. Snow, who, through a Clifford Chance spokesman, declined to comment
yesterday, had pledged that Brobeck would not lay off any associates
while he was chairman. But his successors soon made clear that they
would not abide by that promise. Like other Bay Area law firms whose
clients had collapsed or had cut back sharply on spending, Brobeck began
to lay off lawyers last year, even as the firm was entering costly new
office space in Palo Alto. Mr. Sullivan said such real estate costs were
a result of overbuilding when the economy was booming.

Within Brobeck, Mr. Snow was widely blamed for the firm's financial
problems. Brobeck has tried for months to renegotiate its loan terms and
has also sought merger partners.

The legal landscape has changed drastically in recent years, making it
difficult for firms even of Brobeck's size to compete, Mr. Levin said.

"The profession is consolidating rapidly," he said. "Where we used to
compete on a local or regional basis, now more and more we are all
competing for talent and clients on a national basis."

Asked whether he could recall another collapse of such a large firm, Mr.
Levin said, "I can't think of one."

In the firm's offices yesterday, lawyers were shocked, said Nader
Pakfar, an associate at Brobeck. "I feel terrible for Brobeck and my
friends and colleagues here," he said, adding that as a lawyer who works
on corporate transactions - the kind of work that is not much in demand
in the current economic climate - he was not sure where or when he would
find a job at another firm.

"I guess I'll go to Thailand and live on $200 a month," Mr. Pakfar said.

Sam Hamill's success in making a political statement leads me to conclude
that the old adage is true: Poetry makes Nothing happen. In this case
Something, a poetry symposium led by the First Lady, is happily voided to
Nothing.

If we can throw enough poets at the war itself perhaps that too will be
postponed. What is the old Carl Sandburg poem? "What if they gave a war and
nobody came?"  A question asked by a child, perhaps the same one who put
beans in her ears after being told not to.

How to assess then the success of this action? (And what a shame Marilyn
Nelson's freshly commissioned scarf goes unused.) Doesn't it boil your
blood that the assumption of the White House is that poetry and literature
should be politics-free? What kind of pretty tea-cup do they think you are?

For intentions and integrity I give Sam Hamill high grades. For creativity
and stealth however, I imagine so much more could have been done. I feel an
opportunity was missed by announcing and publicizing the attempt to
embarass the administration in its own house. What did one expect from the
ad hoc Anthology of Dissent? An embossed thank you note?

But "Poetry and the American Voice?" You could have had a ball with that!
You may have read aloud any number of poems (if this was the format,
perhaps it was not; you could have read them anyway) from, say, the new
Rexroth Complete poems that Copper Canyon just published. A beautiful book.


History continuously
     Bleeds to death through a million secret
     Wounds of trivial hunger and fear.
     Its stockholders' private disasters
     Are amortized in catastrophe.

     War is the health of the State? Indeed!
     War is the State. All personal
     Anti-institutional values
     Must be burnt out of each generation.
     If a massive continuum
     Of personality endured
     Into grandchildren, history
     Would stop.

(from "The Phoenix and the Tortoise," 1944)

Pretty rich stuff from someone so lightly dismissed on this List by some
parties last November. But more to the point of my post: perhaps there were
other poets invited to this thing who were planning to use the occasion at
the White House to make their dissenting "American voices" heard. It's a
shame that such an opportunity for poets to be seen and heard as real
public figures was lost.

(Of course this is assuming that there were poets invited who are not
completely lame in verse and person.)

How delightful it would have been to read that Sam Hamill got bounced (or
discretely escorted by the SS) out of the chief executive mansion for
reading (perhaps even "out of turn") a bit of Kenneth Patchen or Muriel
Rukeyser or Alice Notley or Barrett Watten. Maybe other poets would have
followed suit: extending an arm to Billy Collins and Robert Pinsky,
"abandon the dark side, join us!"

How can this appearance of poetry in this vapid barcode culture now be used
as a real political tool? Well, don't go out and write a goddamn poem about
it, and expect THAT to amount to much! There's enough in print, for use, to
go around. Let's start a commotion.

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (Jan. 30) - Former President Nelson Mandela
called
President Bush arrogant and shortsighted and implied that he was racist
for
ignoring the United Nations in his zeal to attack Iraq.

In a speech Thursday, Mandela urged the people of the United States to
join
massive protests against Bush. Mandela called on world leaders,
especially
those with vetoes in the U.N. Security Council, to oppose him.

''One power with a president who has no foresight and cannot think
properly,
is now wanting to plunge the world into a holocaust,'' Mandela told the
International Women's Forum.

Mandela also criticized Iraq for not cooperating fully with the weapons
inspectors and said South Africa would support any action against Iraq
that
was supported by the United Nations.

White House spokesman Ari Fleischer responded to Mandela's criticism by
pointing to a letter by eight European leaders reiterating their
support of
Bush.

''The president expresses his gratitude to the many leaders of Europe
who
obviously feel differently'' than Mandela, Fleischer said. ''He
understands
there are going to be people who are more comfortable doing nothing
about a
growing menace that could turn into a holocaust.''

A Nobel Peace Prize winner, Mandela has repeatedly condemned U.S.
behavior
toward Iraq in recent months and demanded Bush respect the authority of
the
United Nations. His comments Thursday, though, were far more critical
and his
attack on Bush far more personal than in the past.

''Why is the United States behaving so arrogantly?'' he asked. ''All
that
(Bush) wants is Iraqi oil,'' he said.

He accused Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair of undermining the
United Nations and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is from Ghana.

''Is it because the secretary-general of the United Nations is now a
black
man? They never did that when secretary-generals were white,'' he said.

Mandela said the United Nations was the main reason there has been no
World
War III and it should make the decisions on how to deal with Iraq.

He said that the United States, which callously dropped atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, has no moral authority to police the world.

''If there is a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the
world, it is the United States of America. They don't care for human
beings,'' he said.

''Who are they now to pretend that they are the policemen of the world,
the
ones that should decide for the people of Iraq what should be done with
their
government and their leadership?'' he said.

He said Bush was ''trying to bring about carnage'' and appealed to the
American people to vote him out of office and demonstrate against his
policies.

He also condemned Blair for his strong support of the United States.

''He is the foreign minister of the United States. He is no longer prime
minister of Britain,'' he said.

IMMEDIATE ATTENTION NEEDED : HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL

FROM: GEORGE WALKER BUSH 202.456.1414 / 202.456.1111 FAX: 202.456.2461

DEAR SIR / MADAM,

I am George Walker Bush, son of the former president of the United States
of America George Herbert Walker Bush, and currently serving as president
of the United States of America. This letter might surprise you because we
have not met neither in person nor by correspondence. I came to know of
you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very
confidential business transaction, which involves the transfer of a large
sum of money to an account requiring maximum confidence.

I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance
in acquiring oil funds that are presently trapped in the Republic of Iraq.
My partners and I solicit your assistance in completing a transaction
begun by my father, who has long been actively engaged in the extraction
of petroleum in the United States of America, and bravely served his
country as director of the United States Central Intelligence Agency.

In the decade of the nineteen-eighties, my father, then Vice-president of
the United States of America, sought to work with the good offices of the
president of the Republic of Iraq to regain lost oil revenue sources in
the neighboring Islamic Republic of Iran. This unsuccessful venture was
soon followed by a falling out with his Iraqi partner, who sought to
acquire additional oil revenue sources in the neighboring Emirate of
Kuwait, a wholly-owned U.S.-British subsidiary.

My father re-secured the petroleum assets of Kuwait in 1991 at a cost of
sixty-one billion U.S. dollars ($61,000,000,000). Out of that cost,
thirty-six billion dollars ($36,000,000,000) were supplied by his partners
in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf monarchies, and
sixteen billion dollars ($16,000,000,000) by German and Japanese partners.
But my father's former Iraqi business partner remained in control of the
Republic of Iraq and its petroleum reserves.

My family is calling for your urgent assistance in funding the removal of
the President of the Republic of Iraq and acquiring the petroleum assets
of his country, as compensation for the costs of removing him from power.
Unfortunately, our partners from 1991 are not willing to shoulder the
burden of this new venture, which in its upcoming phase may cost the sum
of 100 billion to 200 billion dollars ($100,000,000,000 -
$200,000,000,000), both in the initial acquisition and in long-term
management.

Without the funds from our 1991 partners, we would not be able to acquire
the oil revenue trapped within Iraq. That is why my family and our
colleagues are urgently seeking your gracious assistance. Our
distinguished colleagues in this business transaction include the sitting
Vice-President of the United States of America, Richard Cheney, who is an
original partner in the Iraq venture and former head of the Halliburton
oil company, and Condoleeza Rice, whose professional dedication to the
venture was demonstrated in the naming of a Chevron oil tanker after her.

I would beseech you to transfer a sum equaling ten to twenty-five percent
(10-25 %) of your yearly income to our account to aid in this important
venture. The Internal Revenue Service of the United States of America will
function as our trusted intermediary. I propose that you make this
transfer before the fifteenth (15th) of the month of April.

I know that a transaction of this magnitude would make anyone apprehensive
and worried. But I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the
day. A bold step taken shall not be regretted, I assure you. Please do be
informed that this business transaction is 100% legal. If you do not wish
to co-operate in this transaction, please contact our intermediary
representatives to further discuss the matter.

I pray that you understand our plight. My family and our colleagues will
be forever grateful.  Please reply in strict confidence to the contact
numbers below.

Sincerely with warm regards,

GEORGE WALKER BUSH

Its useful to note how the Times article goes out of its way to promote the
"tea-cup" image of poetry: pretty, irrelevant, a little cracked. By
comparison, the Guardian piece - also based on AP News Wire - that Nick
LoLordo sent to the list yesterday has a flavor almost entirely absent from
U.S. coverage of this "unavoidable" war, especially those outfits owned by
Rupert Murdoch. In particular, the way Hamill's comments are presented is
remarkable. The Guardian quotes

> In an open letter on the site, Mr Hamill explained: "I believe the only
> legitimate response to such a morally bankrupt and unconscionable idea is
to
> reconstitute a Poets Against the War movement like the one organised to
speak
> out against the war in Vietnam."

This compared to the Times' placid

> "Make February 12 a day of Poetry Against the War. We will compile an
> anthology of protest to be presented to the White House on that
> afternoon," the e-mail reads.

One could also mention the air of frivolity the Times manages to grant the
gesture by over-emphasizing Marilyn Nelson's designer scarf, and its
closing with yet another swipe at Baraka - as if to say, aren't these kooky
poets out of touch with the common sense notions that we, fellow citizens,
hold dear. Never mind whether pre-911 stock market activity and other
evidence doesn't make Baraka's allegation seem a little less fanciful.
While I don't think much of Hamill's work - "the monuments in his eyes"? -
its position in the Guardian article makes for quite a different sense of
the public import of poetry.

"Apparently the filters are working out just fine." Actually, part of that
public sense is simply alive in English society as it isn't in the States,
for better or for worse. Think Geoffrey Hill, e.g. the first poem in his
book Canaan. "For better or for worse" because poetry as broad public
address can be a pretty nasty business, as Frost happily demonstrated; but
more importantly because it fosters the sense of a unified social field
that we simply don't have. Even the Populists didn't make the gesture of
standing in one place to address the many, though their rhetoric can tend
in that direction - Vachel  Lindsay walked across most of the continent (MA
to NM) talking with people face to face, lodging in their houses in
exchange for books and an evening of his poetry. Which is to say there is a
"secret" - that is, active and vernacular - history of public dissent from
the poets; but the public so conceived is smaller, more local if not always
regional: an anarchic or rhizomatic versus "state" sense of address. Duncan
and Ginsberg spring immediately to mind, the Poets Against the War movement
that Hamill mentions. [Which is sketchy in my recollection: perhaps those
better informed can elaborate? Please.]

Daniel again:

I like this: the limitations of poetry "in itself" versus the useful
commotions in which it can involve itself. Instead of worrying that the
"prevailing climate" doesn't seem to support that localized sense of
dissent, consider how that climate is sustained - imagine trying to change
it in little ways. Wake up, rain drop. A few of the writers in Buffalo have
started a series of anonymous anti-war pamphlets, for instance, that
contain short, sharp poems and information on local protests and war
resistance groups. To be left on busses, in newspaper machines, whereever.
That's a small project, but it's something. It might get a few people
involved, might change the way poetry is thought of by a few people. Even
if the poetry just puzzles, it might get someone to look. Bigger things can
be put together by bigger people, and we should actively encourage that -
the upcoming St. Marks thing for instance - but that doesn't mean that the
rest of us do nothing. Dust off that old copy of Abbie Hoffman.

Anyway, thanks for some thoughts, Daniel. I'm late for my chiropractor's
appointment!


Chris

I like Daniel Bouchard's comments.
I want to suggest to Sam Hamill as the instigator - as well as to the rest
of us who participated in sending him work - that we each individually send
our anthology contribution directly to the White House with a "Dear Laura"
letter of regrets that we could not have our work presented on what seemed
like a special occasion for the recognition of the significance of poetry in
American culture. (Of course, it might be some weeks before the letters
actually reach her - this will be a rare and probably the first opportunity
for many of us to have our poems subjected to a preliminary anthrax
analysis!).
In the meantime, the morning paper says Dana Gioia received unanimous
approval from the U.S. Senate as the new head of the National Endowment for
the Arts. I am personally going to ask my local media contacts to call Gioia
for a comment on the cancellation of "Poetry & the American Voice" at the
White House. And to give Billy Collins a call as well. It will be curious to
see how the poets cast their spins.
Maybe if we each called people we know in the media to make calls to both
Gioia and Collins,  we can further rumple the cultural/political fabric
beyond Laura Bush's cancellation.   I must say she answered the often asked
question as whether or not there is any connection between poetry/art and
politics.

Meantime, two great readings in the past week in the Bay Area were,
yesterday evening, Tom Raworth at UC Berkeley (his big Collected just barely
out from Carcanet (sp?), and Kit Robinson with his new book, Crave, from
Atelos at the Lab in SF. Both keeping the language incredibly sharp and
smart.

Now playing in New York & not to be missed:

Panic (How to Be Happy)

written and directed by Richard Foreman

"He goes where no man has dared to go. Let's all join the misfit club"

"This play is like the sacred text of a forgotten people -- everything is
in it -- therefore protect yourself by wearing the transparent blinders
with which you have been provided -- oh -- forgive me -- I see you are
already wearing them!"

from the press realease:

For his 35th anniversary production, Panic (How To Be Happy), Richard
Foreman goes for broke with 75 minutes of total madness.

In Panic (How To Be Happy), a band of eccentric desperados tries to provoke
self-enlightenment through ritual sex, magic, mountain climbing, and
convulsive dancing as they invoke "The Old Man of the Mountain" who bestows
gifts amidst multiple catastrophes.

The music of Mahler, Schoenberg and Punk Rock, punctuated by howling
wolves, echoes between the Carpathian peaks, as madness and mysticism
amazingly dissolve into an ocean of frenzied love

The exotic cast features Tea Alagic, Robert Cucuzza, Elina Lowensohn and DJ
Mendel (Mendel and Cucuzza both appeared in Foreman's Permanent Brain
Damage) and the usual assortment of dwarves.
